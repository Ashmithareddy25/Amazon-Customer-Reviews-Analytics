B002SJIO4A|1.0|My wife and I both see a lot of movies and we often disagree- but we both agreed that this is one of the worst movies we've ever seen.  We fell for the hype that surrounded this dog and paid full price to see this movie instead of waiting till it reached Redbox and boy was that a mistake.  Maybe the movie is designed for fourteen year old boys or something- I'm not sure, but it was absolutely horrible.
B002TYZKIM|1.0|It was a 'behind the scenes' of what could've been.  Michael Jackson was entertaining to watch.  His songs were hits.  That's it.  People claiming Michael Jackson was a life-changing force must consider looking at themselves first.  It doesn't help that people are so quick jump on the band wagon and deify him.    Michael Jackson was just a guy doing what he enjoyed.
B002QW7AJY|3.0|I started with no expectations for the movie. I had read reviews tying it to Aliens, Event Horizon, etc, but I found the movie to stand on its own merit. Dennis Quaid is not entirely convincing as the lieutenant, but Ben Harper does a great job capturing the emotions of confusion, fear, and determination that drive his character.     My only problem with the film is that the timeline was never made clear. It's obviously been a long time. *minor spoiler* If the antagonists are mutated humans, then they've been in hypersleep long enough for evolution to take place. However, the actual timeline or methodology of what chambers are opened and when is never explored.    Overall the atmosphere, suspense, and desire to see things thru carry the movie. The ending is itself a bit of a surprise, and cleverly done.
B000002UYZ|5.0|You almost can't go wrong with a collection of The Beatles' best work from 1962-1966; they had so many outstanding tracks that most songs just pick themselves. But even allowing for this, 'Red' does an excellent job of collating the hit singles and key album tracks from the Fab Four's most commercially successful period.    All of the band's major British and American hit singles are here, from 'Love Me Do' to 'Eleanor Rigby/Yellow Submarine'. What else can be said about these songs apart from the fact that they're some of the greatest music ever made; from the boyish enthusiasm of 'Please Please Me' and 'A Hard Day's Night' to the more sophisticated 'Yesterday' and 'Paperback Writer'.     'Red' also collects many important album tracks from the period; 'All My Loving', 'And I Love Her', 'You've Got To Hide Your Love Away', 'Drive My Car', 'In My Life', 'Nowhere Man'. These are inspired selections, and their presence really highlights how brilliant The Beatles were. Most other bands would have been proud to have these as their best single...The Beatles relegated such masterpieces to album tracks!     The songs are presented in chronological order, which allows us to follow the band's growing ambition and experimentation, culminating in the pre-psychadelia of the 1966 singles. As well, the album contains the complete lyrics, plus a selection of photographs from the period. Again, we witness the evolution in the band's style from the clean cut lads of 1962-3 to the self-conscious cool of sunglasses and cigarettes in 1965-6.     Since the band had so many memorable tracks, it's easy to complain about what's missing. If you wanted to be picky, you might question whether 'Rubber Soul' deserves SIX tracks here. Maybe 'Girl' could have made way for something like 'Rain', 'No Reply', 'I'm A Loser', 'I Should Have Known Better' or 'I Saw Her Standing There'. Others also have noted that the 26 songs here could probably have fit on 1 CD instead of 2. But overall, these are minor quibbles.     Obviously, anyone with more than a passing interest in The Beatles should pick up the individual albums. But since most of the band's singles never appeared on albums, 'Red' is still an important collection to own, for die-hards as well as casual fans. A really comprehensive, complete package that does its job well. You can't ask for much better than this.     Five stars.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Like many readers of Dan Brown, I had been anticipating his newest release for quite some time. One of the aspects of his writing that I have always enjoyed is the amount of research that goes into his novels. I love the imagery that he creates with his descriptions of people, places and events. As with Angels & Demons and The DaVinci Code, I found myself wanting to be where he was writing about.     The story itself grabbed hold of me and didn't let me go until the end. It had enough twists to keep me from putting the book down when I should. I always love an ending that I didn't see coming and Dan Brown masterfully did that in this book.    It is a great book...worth reading 2 times at least. As I re-read it, I found more intricacies within the story that I had missed the first time, reading it as fast as I could.
B0000C1733|4.0|The Chili's second major 'Hits' album covers the band's most commercially successful period, and does a reasonable job of collecting the hits from 'Blood Sugar..' to 'By The Way'. This is probably good enough for casual fans, but more serious Chili enthusiasts should note that nothing from the band's first four ablums is here except their cover of 'Higher Ground'. Those interested in the early Chili's heavier, funkier sound need to seek out the first collection 'What Hits?!'    As might be expected, the collection is dominated by the mega-selling 'Blood Sugar..' and 'Californication'. Obvious inclusions such as 'Give It Away', 'Suck My Kiss', 'Breaking The Girl', 'Under The Bridge', 'Californication', 'Otherside', 'Road Trippin' and 'Scar Tissue' are here....these are all outstanding examples of the Chili's rock/rap/pop sound. The non-album track 'Soul To Squeeze' and new track 'Fortune Faded' are other great songs. But surely 'Around The World' deserves to be here more than 'Parallel Universe'? It would have been nice to have included a few more songs from 'By The Way' as well, particularly 'Zephyr Song' and 'Can't Stop'. And why is 'My Friends' the only inclusion from 'One Hot Minute'? I know the band is determined to airbrush that album out of history, but so what? Greatest Hits albums are for the fans, not the band. At least one of 'Warped' and 'Aeroplane' (if not both) deserves a place here.     In a way, the album is a victim of the Chili's own success: 16 songs (14 if you exclude the inevitable Two New Songs) just aren't enough to do justice to the number of hits the band had. With several of the hits missing, there's obviously no room for fan favourites or popular album tracks here, either. It might have been a better idea to release a double album, include all the aforementioned singles, plus a couple of rare cult favourites or popular B-sides as something for the die-hard fans.     Still, as it is, it's a pretty good collection. It's certainly a good placeto start for casual fans who just want the FM radio \\"hits\\". Just be aware that there is much more to the Chili's than this, and you should take the time to explore their individual albums as well.

B0000CABBW|4.0|This coming of age story follows the incredible and abstract Paikea. The sole survivor of her birth, she left behind her mother, and twin brother who would have been the next chief of the Maori tribe in New Zealand. The story jumps right into the disapproval of her grandfather, the chief of their tribe, who feels little hope, and very little want for Paikea, immediately after Paikea's father leaves the tribe. The story follows Paikea through her late adolescent years, watching as she, despite her gender, intends to be the person or prophet her grandfather is looking for, the person he feels he lost with when her twin brother died at birth. Through trial and error, and much shunning from her grandfather's presence Paikea teaches herself the \\"old ways\\" and learns how to become chief of the Maori tribe, with the assistance of a young male friend, her grandmother, and her black sheep uncle. Paikea learns the ways of the warrior, her heritage, and the ways needed to connect with her ancestors, in order to win her grandfather's attention and trust, and continually fails miserably.  This movie focuses much on the idea of indigenous sacred ways from myth-based religions of early native tribes. The sole idea of the tribe, is that a warrior Paikea, for which our young heroine Paikea was named, saved their tribe when they traveled to New Zealand. He was tired and scared, but was then able to catch a ride upon the back of the whale and came to their new destination to live. Paikea's twin brother, being the first born son of the first born son of the chief was intended to fill the role of chief and \\"whale rider\\". Throughout the movie, you are able to see the greetings in which people of this tribe greet each other, mimicking the breath of a whale into each other's face, rather than a hug or a kiss. You can see native body art, and dress, and see the hierarchy that exists between all of the tribe. But I think the most incredible of these sacred ways is the way that they turn to their ancestors, who are now embodied as whales, for guidance.   I was skeptical when renting it, but very pleased at my choice. This movie kept me captivated, both with suspense of what would come next, and with the heart strings it pulled at throughout the movie. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.

055358894X|3.0|Since Christmas I've been blasting through book after book on my new Kindle and it's been really fun.  Unfortunately, the string of great books ended with this one.  It's not that this wasn't a good book, it just wasn't engaging until about the last third; and, by that point I already felt like I was finishing the book just to say I had.<br /><br />The problem, for me, was really the way the story was written.  The chapters alternate between the past and the present so I never really got lost in either story line.  With a good book I get completely engrossed in the story and kind of forget that I'm reading - but that could never happen with this book because of the choppy alternating style.<br /><br />To be fair, the last third of the book focused more on the present and got a lot more interesting.  The alternating chapters continued, but they got shorter and covered more random topics rather than a second storyline from the past.  Even with the good ending, I'm not sure I'd recommend this book to anyone - my only recommendation is once you've started it you might as well finish.  It really does get better (unlike some books).
1591843162|5.0|Seth's books have evolved over the years. What started with insights about marketing (he is the one who opened up our eyes to the fact that anonymous spam email campaigns are not effective), is now moving into the area of leadership and in Linchpin even broader: what is the purpose of the time you spend day in, day out.<br />If there is one unifying theme in all his books it would be: \\"the good guys can win\\" (came up with this while listening to Leonard Cohen's song \\"Everybody knows\\"). You can be successful by doing remarkable things, without a need to cheat, interrupt, or lie.<br /><br />The book opens with a grim analysis of history. Over the past 100 years we have built a society (education, advertising) that trains people to be cogs: cheap, willing, replaceable, numb, insecure people that man the production lines and purchase the stuff that the factory churns out.<br /><br />It is time to escape the trap and change. It's urgent. Not changing will get you fired, and/or bore you to death, and/or rob you of your dignity, and/or paralyze your abilities and talents as you live and work in constant fear. On top of that, all of us own so much stuff that we do not even know what to do with it anymore.<br /><br />The linchpin is a small but critical part that holds the wheel in place. Seth wants us to become one. \\"Us\\", the target audience of the book seems to be today's army of middle managers filling cubicles in office towers around the world.<br /><br />You can see that Seth is a blog writer, the book contains many smaller ideas that are bundled together in one book cover.<br /><br />Emotional labor creates art: work that touches people, changes them.You are not born with a talent for art, you do not have to be able to know how to draw to be an artist. If what you do changes people, it's art.<br /><br />Gifts are powerful and will pay back somehow. Be generous without running an ROI calculation in your head. If you want a copper plate with your name in return for your gift, you do not feel emotionally strong enough about it. It is probably better not to give at all in that case.<br /><br />The resistance is strong. Our \\"lizard\\" brain wants us to be safe, warm, and comfortable and tells us all the time to back away. One defense against the resistance is to \\"ship\\" at the time you set yourself, even if your product/idea/post is not 100% perfect.<br /><br />The Internet/social media can be powerful to connect with people and spread ideas, but when it teams up with the resistance it becomes a huge time waster. We feel connected Twittering away, but the clock is running as well: \\"what happened to your art when you were Tweeting?\\"<br /><br />Anger, anxiety, and a longing for revenge are destructive and time-wasting emotions deeply rooted in our lizard brain. Anxiety is very often used as a motivator in big corporates: do as I tell you or I will fire you. People under constant stress cannot perform. There is no art when you are running away from a tiger that's chasing you.<br />There is no map, no manual about how to become a linchpin. And no, this is not about Seth being lazy and not giving us the solution, being a linchpin is the exact opposite of following a manual with standard procedures.<br /><br />It is hard to see clearly, especially when you are in the trenches doing routine cog work, spend time in useless meetings, busy reading 100s of Tweets or stressed out about the upcoming performance review<br /><br />Being a linchpin gives meaning to who you are and what you do, but will not necessarily turn you into a millionaire. But hey, we own already too much things anyway.<br /><br />You can see that it took Seth a long time to write this book.<br /><br />It bundles different ideas. Some passages are clearly written at the height of the economic crisis last year (linchpins don't get fired, be a linchpin to hold on to your seat).<br /><br />The language is much more deep and abstract than in Seth's other books. Many sentences requirere-reading. One explanation is that they come from a set of ideas collected in a note book over a longer period of time.e.

B001BGTWXI|1.0|This album is by far the worst album Slipknot has come out with.  They will really have to put in some effort to top this one.  Corey, along with the rest of the band, let the Stone Sour sound bleed into the songs which was a really bad idea seeing as how that band sucks too.  I'm a big fan of Slipknot and when I listen to them, I want to feel the energy of the music.  I usually enjoy listening to what the singer has to say as well but not when it comes to this band. I loved the yelling and fast paced vocals.  They state how they wanted this album to be their heaviest to date but it is far from being heavy.  They are following the same path as Korn except Korn had 5 good albums before becoming horrible.  It only took Slipknot 4.
0061450162|4.0|Great book: a diverse group of stories and poems written with emotional depth and sense of wonderment only Gaiman can conjure. I'm not going to offer mini-reviews of each story or spoilers... that's just not me, but to make it easier (if you trust my judgement), the stand-out stories are (by the way: all stories are good but these are my favorites): \\"The Wedding Present\\" (read the introduction), \\"The Price\\", \\"The Goldfish Pool and Other Stories\\", \\"The White Road\\", \\"Queen of Knives\\", \\"Changes\\", \\"Looking for the Girl\\", \\"Only the End of the World Again\\", \\"Bay Wolf\\", \\"We Can Get Them for you Wholesale\\", \\"One Life, Furnished in Early Moorcock\\", \\"Foreign Parts\\", \\"Mouse\\", \\"Murder Mysteries\\", and \\"Snow, Glass, Apples\\".
B002CIY8EM|3.0|The title really shows it's age in later chapters. I would recommend a newer title for sure. it makes all kinds of crazy predictions about advances we'll make in the 80's in space tech that just never panned out.

B0000542D2|5.0|When this film was released in 1964, everyone thought that it would flop, but the movie critics loved it and compared The Bealtes to the Marx brothers. And of course all of the songs are great.
142313494X|5.0|I have read a book from this author and am now a fan. Picking up this book and reading it could not put it down. Has me wishing that life was really like this the world would be so much fun. I love an adventure and this does take you on one from finding out that Percy is the son of a Greek God and he has powers. I look forward to reading the other series even look forward to the movie that is coming out soon. But I'm sure the book is better then the movie usually is.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|If you think that this film is about Al Capone, well then think again. It's about a Cuban that came to America during the time that Castro put all the Cuban criminals on boats and sent them to America. It's very graphic, both in dialog and violence. Pacino gives, as usual, a great performance.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I really like this Disney flick. My sister and I have shared llama jokes since we first saw this movie. Now, I have purchased the movie for my kids. They really like it too- they will sit down and watch it and laugh! Amazing!!!
B00005AG7K|5.0|This film never aired in the U.S. only on T.V. in the U.K. A must have for any true Bealtes fan.
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|Buyer beware, this film is indeed Dark. Unless your idea of being entertained is being mugged by almost nonstop gratuitous violence, you will not enjoy this film. The graphic violence that is Hollywood's bread-and-butter is in full view here. It is not healthy for us, and it is not healthy for our children. Again, buyer beware!
B000UG78NG|3.0|On one of the last pages of the book, the protagonist makes the following statement:  \\"That should do for now, I imagine.  We have all the groundwork now.  A foundation of story to build upon.\\"    That statement pretty much sums up this book in my view.  There is a great foundation for a story going forward.  Unfortunately, I didn't find much of a story in THIS book.  By that, I mean nothing really happens.  The events that do happen don't really seem to go anywhere.  You can draw some conclusions and identify some areas where previous occurrences in the book serve the protagonist as time goes on, but other occurrences don't seem to really have a point.  To call this trilogy the \\"Kingkiller Chronicles\\" is interesting as I don't recall any mention of a king in the entire book.    On the plus side, the author does create an interesting world and provides a fresh take on some of the fantasy genre's cliches.  For better or worse (depending on your view/opinion), there just wasn't enough action for me to really become engaged.    As stated above, the \\"foundation\\" is there for a great story.  I just didn't find that story here.  I may be interested in finishing the series, but will likely wait until all books are written before returning to Kvothe's tale.  As the author has not placed a date on publishing the second novel, that could be some time.
B000002GAF|5.0|Nothing like a little Gino to set the mood.  This is the quintessential Gino record.  I still have the vinyl and if I'm feeling the 80's I'll take it out for a spin.  As far as I'm concerned this is his greatest hits album.  If you are a Gino fan you already have this. If you don't know who Gino is then try this, it's a great introduction to his music and leave you wondering why you never heard of him before.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|The ESV study Bible is great, but it's so enormous that the Kindle doesn't handle it very well. Page turns and navigation are quite sluggish.<br /><br />UPDATE: With newer, faster Kindles, the massive size of the book isn't the problem that it once was. Also, the touch screen on models like the Paperwhite make a big difference for clicking links. Still, for something like a study Bible, tablet and smart phone apps are much more efficient. If you want a Bible to just read, you're better off getting just the ESV or whatever translation you want, not a study Bible.<br /><br />I'm going with 4 stars for the Kindle version now, instead of the previous 3.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|This is the second CW CD that I have bought and I love it. The music is wonderful and as usual the songs are great to listen to.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I have seen this movie twice now in 3D IMAX and truly don't understand the negative comments.  I thought it was brilliant!  People read too much into it and truly have unrealistic expectations.  They compare it to real life and it isn't real life at all.  Some people only search out the negative in absolutely anything.  Take it for what it is...the excellent work of a truly gifted and brilliant mind.  I don't think I blinked the entire movie...it was well worth it for me to see it twice.  If you have a problem or complaint about this movie, lighten up.  It was excellent and I would recommend anyone and everyone go see it.
B002W6Z0UK|3.0|Typically I don't read reviews on albums I'm set on buying because they often involve critiques I don't need.  But NOW I finally know what was meant by \\"any edits that are apparent are part of the mix and intentional!\\"  When I read that statement I originally thought, \\"oh it's Lady Gaga, that could mean anything.\\" But regardless of disclaimers and reviews that highlight the censorship problem, typically the expectation is that you're getting what you've heard on the radio, in the music video, and there will also be typically the word \\"clean\\" in apostrophes if it's censored.  And the mix isn't even censored well; like earlier reviewers have noted, any 'explicit' lyric was not replaced by another word or cut completely out but audibly 'clipped.'  The album is still good but since lyrics ARE a huge part of a song's success, having them altered was a disappointment and I have yet to find an uncensored version on this site.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I bought this CD because it had \\"Break The Ice\\" and \\"Piece Of Me\\" on it. It also had \\"Radar\\" which was on Circus, the first CD I bought from her.<br /><br />The moment I got this, the first thing I did was put it in my CD player and listen to it. I think it had a few good songs, but I have to admit I didn't like it nearly as much as \\"Circus\\". I think the songs \\"Get N aked (I Got A Plan)\\" and \\"Toy Soldier\\" could probably have been better if they had been written with different tunes/notes.<br /><br />Either way, this is an okay CD. Buy it if you like Britney's music, and also buy Circus. :)
0805091742|5.0|How can something as rudimentary as a checklist be so revolutionary?  Gawande, in a style that is never boring or dry, uses real-world examples from diverse fields -- aviation, construction, medicine, to name a few -- to illustrate how checklists can help anyone be more effective.  This subject could be a real snooze, but Gawande is a terrific writer, and the result is a lively read.
1416572287|3.0|When I first saw 'How to teach physics to your dog' I snatched it up hoping for a witty yet informative instant classic. After all, I have a dog who seems to be capable of learning just about anything (including people-training). When it arrived I spent several evenings reading it together with my teenage daughter. Unfortunately, the most we got out of this book is that Chad Orzel's talking dog must be smarter than we are.<br /><br />The key lesson learned is that, no matter how smart it is, a dog is still a dog and likewise, no matter how much you couch quantum theory in cute 'chase a bunny through a wall' concepts, quantum theory is still quantum theory and its whole 'square can be round' ideology doesn't, and probably never will, sink in with me.<br /><br />Thanks for trying Chad, but I guess I'm one of those people who has to believe that there are some rules to the universe that can't be changed.
1591843162|5.0|It's not a book, it's a call to action. As Godin says in the book, if you're waiting for your sign, this is it.<br /><br />Chances are, you've considered these concepts before. You've felt undervalued, under appreciated, underpaid... it's time for you to make the movement toward a happier, healthier working life (and all other aspects of your life too!).<br /><br />It's part self-help, part common sense, and a serious dose of wakeup call.  It's hard to look at the way the working world in the same way.
B000X107GI|5.0|I was skeptical when I sent my order because of the extreme low pricing. I figured even when they send me one, it'll still be cheaper than local store. This is what I got.<br />5 cells of Maxell CR2032, made in Japan by Hitachi, just like advertized, nothing less.<br />I calculated how much per piece after subtracting the stamp value on the envelope they came in. It was 27 cents each.<br />I paid more for 5 cells of other size(smaller capacity) no name batteries made in China through eBay. First, second ones performed ok but the rest had been self-discharged to nearly no juice in them.<br />I know I haven't used any of the battery yet, so I can't be sure the same thing won't happen to these batteries. At least it has a well known brand name, so I'm confident they will hold up. I'll post how the batteries perform, but it'll have to be a several years from now.<br /><br />The name of store I bought from is MYBATTERYSUPPLIER.<br /><br />*update* (1-25-16)<br />Fist cell I used in my garage door opener in Sept. 2014 is still working without showing any signs of slowing down. Brand name matters when it comes to buying batteries.

The cards were sent in a flat piece of cardboard,  that was folded over the cards. The deck worked it's way out of the tarot box and as  a result the tarot box was crushed on arrival. I guess Amazon couldn't afford real  packaging.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|It is gorgeous and captivating and there has never been one quite like it. I simply adore this movie.
0786868724|5.0|This is the kind of book that you can't put down.  I read this book in a few days.  It is easy reading and Mitch Albom is a fantastic writer.  He keeps you guessing from one minute to the next what is going to happen.  I love his style of writing with the flashbacks.  I read Five People You Meet in Heaven in 2 days.  I am waiting to read Tuesdays with Morrie and For Another Day(?).  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a true story and is an avid reader.  Very inspirational.
044656740X|5.0|The gem of knowledge that I gained from this book is the way of thinking about money.  Simply put, his concept of \\"Making money work for you, rather than working for money.\\"  has been a complete revelation for me.  Since I fall into the highly educated, debt ridden, middle class that he derides, I do see the value of his attitude towards money.  However, I did find shocking his disdain for his Poor Dad, who was well educated but not monied.  He makes it out like his poor Dad not having money was the worst thing in the world.  When I just want to shake the author and tell him, listen, your poor Dad supported you and provided you with a nice growing up experience.  The rich Dad had you working for free and wouldn't even let you play softball.  So, the fellow's overwhelmingly capitalistic attitude gets to be most annoying throughout the book.  But at the same time, I find value in the concept of having assets be greater than liabilities and making money work for me money rather than just working for money.
B002VT6C0K|1.0|The stories I read (only the 1st 6) had no point and ended so abruptly that I thought pages were missing.  This is only the 2nd book ever that I've started reading & won't finish.  It's that bad.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|This is an enjoyable movie with a lot of replay value (I've watched it a number of times and don't get tired of it).  Having it on blu-ray is very nice as there is some incredible scenery in the film.  Due to my setup, I actually like the fact that it has dolby 5.1 and not HD dolby...  This allows me to get surround sound via a digital optical cable.  I have my picture going through an hdmi cable but audio through the optical cable, because of this, a few of my blu-rays have to be played with linear audio and I can't use bitstream (taking away my surround sound).

0316069906|2.0|Having not read any of the author's novels yet, but having heard their acclaim, I expected him to be a talented writer.    His writing in this book is just not quality writing.  It is undisciplined and unfocused.  He jumps around, rather than progressing steadily either toward one central point or several key points.      He posits rhetorical questions that he feels flow naturally from the sentences preceding them, but they don't.    It's as though no one ever taught Safran-Foer how to construct an argument, persuasive paper, or any work of nonfiction.  Positioned next to journalists who have written books on the same topic- Pollan, Schlosser, et al- the differences are stark, and Safran-Foer ends up sounding childish, holding an ill-presented, overemotional argument.    Separately, the author has a very strong view of animals, believing them to be funny-looking people.  This seems a natural outgrowth of a childhood with no pets, a life-long fear of dogs, and the very unusual circumstance of having never seen a live farm animal until in his 30s.      I expect many readers to be offended by the frequent comparisons of animal agriculture to human slavery, a viewpoint not shared by most humans.
B00005NB0H|5.0|the original 6 song album is a hard rock masterpiece of the highest order. it's one of the who's best albums. only \\"WHO'S NEXT\\" is definitely better.  the original album is by far the most powerful version with no talk or filler to slow things down. short and sweet, it still packs quite a punch today.  it will knock you out. more is not better in this case.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I had just finished reading this novel by Jane Austen on my Kindle, and remembered seeing this on PBS a couple of years ago. I only caught the tail end of it, but decided to buy this. As with the book which was written towards the end of Jane Austen's life, the movie portrayed an older and more somber young woman, with less of the sense of humor that filled her earlier books. Perhaps life had 'beaten' Austen down...she had not had the opportunity to marry, nor had her sister after her fiance had died overseas. Austen most probably died of breast cancer which may have been giving her problems by the time she was writing this book. Whatever the reason, this story lacked the joy of the earlier ones, and this movie was not the best portrayal of the book in comparison to the many other portrayals of the other books. It seemed very choppy and didn't tie all the information in together that the book did such as the fact that the protagonist's male cousin and the woman who befriended her sister and father were in cahoots.     Maybe in a few years, someone else in England will see fit to produce this story again...they seem to like to redo Austen's stories on a regular basis. I hope they do. This isn't a bad movie, just not accurate and in keeping with the book.

0679643362|5.0|The book itself is a treasure, I can't add to any of the kudos it's received, but till now I've only been able to appreciate it in the original German (which is pretty simple and doesn't require a PhD in Germanic Studies to decode). The two English translations I have are simply a shame, with as much heart and poetry as the average daily newspaper column. This one, however, judging by the first chapter generously provided above, looks very promising, it drew me in right away and certainly makes me want to order the book, which I'll do as soon as I post this review :-)<br /><br />So, now I'm wondering why neither this version nor the Hilda Rosner I've seen mentioned are the major translations of the book. Why does the bland version with 496 reviews, and no named translator come up at the top of the list when you search the title here? Very strange...<br /><br />Translating is an ART, and not everyone who is bilingual can do it well. A good translation can be more difficult to achieve than writing a book from scratch. And, like I said, this one seems to project the voice of the original.
B002RPQ11S|3.0|This CD has Jello Biafra (Dead Kennedys) all over it - from the snarly delivery to the ironic lyrics; in a way, it's not far at all from the musical flavor of Jello's work. Needless to say, there's also abundant political and social commentary - the informed, detailed lyrics that make listening all the more rewarding. Admittedly, you won't find anything like the catchy material from the DK's more memorable output; it would be difficult to find particular songs that stick in your memory. But for combining musical flavor and mood, it's hard to fault this record's over effect.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|nobody then or since is touching Michael Joe Jackson. the Man was a Musical Genius who made you step up your game.  if you watch Americna Idol then this is what \\"this is it\\" was all about. bringing it raw and real to the stage.  alot of these turkeys we got now have to use studio gimmicks or enhancements to cover there weak vocals,etc.. and on stage? forget about it.  you are talking a musical Icon in Michael Jackson who could stand behind a curtain and you knew who he was.  let some of these turkeys stand behind the curtain and watch them get yanked asap.<br /><br />MJ the singer is well in display. he sounded really good and knew his timing.  he handled the music and he knew what went where and how to add the spice when it called for it. He was always a Pro's Pro. that is the thing missing something terrible nowadays the Professionalism. what happen to given people a show and being a class act?  MJ had that rare gift.<br /><br />he kicked and pounded that Left foot and you knew he meant business. that is what taken it to the stage is all about.<br /><br />it's so sad it took death to make some folks see what Greatness this Man truly had and how he touched so many lives all over the world.  he was more than a Song and dance man, he was a Professional Artist who took his craft seriously, however his work ethic and being a Perfectionist  made him make it all look so easy and that was the Magic.<br /><br />straight up the Beatles,Sinatra and Elvis,etc.. aren't in the same universe as this Man musically. who else from the time they were a Kid til Middle Age could make you look and still be in Awe?  He did it all and made it all feel so magical.<br /><br />this Story shows you what it takes to make it work on the stage with each Musician doing there thing, all the dancers, singers and the behind the scenes team all doing there work. at the center of it all though was the Creative Genius of Michael Jackson.<br /><br />tears still run down my face as i remember how great of a talent he was and more important how much the Soul Brother broke barriers and knocked down doors for so many acts thereafter. he was a one of a Kind talent.a Great Humanitarian and Great Cretive Genius.  Props to all involved in this fantastic film that in truth I never wanted to see end.he Soul Brother broke barriers and knocked down doors for so many acts thereafter. he was a one of a Kind talent.a Great Humanitarian and Great Cretive Genius.

B0034JKZ86|4.0|First let me say i'm not anti-3D animation or Hannah Montana but in recent years Disney has been lacking major quality in their movies and programs although UP and The Incredibles are some exceptions I just don't think movie's like Meet The Robinsons or Hannah Montana The Movie are gonna stand the test of time like Lion King Or Beauty And The Beast not that their terrible movies well maybe the latter of those is But they just don't have the creativity or imagination that the movies i grew up watching had most of what kids watch today is garbage. NOW to the Princess and The Frog i loved this movie it was so much fun it has a lot of great characters my favorite is Ray a cajun firefly and Louis a trumpet playing alligator Most of songs were catchy and had a great jazzy flavor to them this is probably one of the better Disney musicals I think Randy Newman did a great job Alan Menken Who? Tiana is a very independent princess she doesn't need any prince charming to save her and shes a very hard worker probably to hard And the prince Naveen is the polar opposite he's a lazy playboy who just want's to have fun Dr.Facilcer is the bad guy in the movie and i didn't really think of him as a villain until near the end of the movie If you saw it you KNOW what i'm talking about I was in the theater and i was like OH HELL NO!!But i want spoil anything There are a few more characters i like Tiana's best friend Charlotte Or as tiana calls her Lotte and Mama Odie who's sorta like a fairy godmother but not I thought Charlotte deserved more screen time her and Louis were very funny The animation in this movie is amazing i was mesmerized a couple times during the movie especially during Dr Facilers performance of Friends On The Other Side it was just beautiful the whole movie was The people who hand draw these movie are true artist.Now to rap this up i'll say that PATF is a very good movie i've already pre-orded it However it's not on the same level as the Lion King or Beauty and the Beast but it's really close It's a step in the right direction for 2D movies to comeback and if Disney continues to make 2d movies like this one there shouldn't be any reason for them to disappear again  i'm looking forward to seeing more great movies like this one from Disney.
0743270754|5.0|Probably one of the best historical books I have read.No wonder he is our greatest President. I almost could not read about his assasination. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in history. If I were teaching high school history I would make my students read this book for a book report. I would also make them watch in class Ken Burns epic series on P.B.S. \\"the Civil War\\". This book also puts into prespective that our present day politics is really not that bad compared to what Lincoln had to endure.

B002VKE1K2|1.0|This \\"film\\" -- and that's a generous description -- benefits from the most manipulative ad campaign EVER.  Read the other Amazon one- and two-star rewiews which have already shredded the paper-thin plot.    Did you see the trailer?  Wonder why so much of the camerawork is aimed at audience gasps rather than film clips?  Well, the \\"flying guy\\" is the only effect even remotely special.  You will spend 80 or 90 minutes, if you can endure that long, with the blandest \\"couple dialogue\\" in movie history.    Oh, spoiler alert:  Did anyone else find it incredibly weird that the actress at one point applies deodorant right BEFORE going to bed?  And is that a sign of imminent satanic possession?    And the house!  Easy for the producer to find a three-bedroom, two-story drywall palace with the housing collapse, I suppose.  Please -- where do the main characters derive such income?  After wasting your night in their abode, furnished sparsely with items from the Rooms-to-Go after-clearance sale, you will soon wish for the couple's undoing.    Add a few ghastly supporting actors.  All in all, makes the Blair Witch Project look like a Fellini or Spielberg opus.    I'm leaving my DVD on top of my trash dumpster on pick-up day, to torment some unsuspecting motorist who stops.  Bwaaaaaaahaaaaaaahaaaaaaa!  And much more scary.    Addition:  Err ... did I just read that early viewers of the film could somehow get their names added to the credits when PA went into wide release?!?  Would explain the bizarre and unwarranted number of five-star reviews.  Yes, every one of those dipsy-doodles have likely five-starred this rat-trap to enhance their moment of non-fame.  Again, marketing genius, horrid movie.

B0015DROBO|5.0|The core problem of Asperger Syndrome is our Mindblindness, not being able to realize, automatically and without conscious effort, the mindstates of others; what others want, think, or feel.<br /><br />Asperger kids do not realize that there is a simple way to avoid being victimized by bullies at school: by hitting back. To be able to realize that, you need to realize first that the other kids have a mind of their own, and that we could *_convince_* (mindstate!) them that it is not a good idea to mess with us.<br /><br />And then the misery and bullying and teasing goes on and on without end. Include possible sexual abuse too in the case of girls.<br /><br />This book is priceless, but the author did not really research Asperger Syndrome as well as he should have.

1594488878|3.0|For a light, breezy book, Juliet, Naked by Nick Hornby sure deals with some pretty heady questions: Can bad people create good art? (Sure!) If so, is that art lessened if it is disingenuously inspired? (Um, maybe?) And from the fan perspective, at what point does obsession so cannibalize appreciation, that the fan can no longer assess art objectively? (A good hint is the point you lose your 15-year relationship over your obsession...)<br /><br />But as interesting as these questions are to think about, the plot which frame those questions in this novel sort of falls flat. The characters are real and fully developed (if not entirely likable) and the writing is excellent. So, what's the problem?<br /><br />Let's look at the characters first: Tucker Crowe is a formerly famous American singer-songwriter who hasn't recorded since his masterpiece album Juliet more than 20 years ago. Now, as a 55-year-old do-nothing, he's slowly destroying his third marriage and beginning to regret the path his life has taken.<br /><br />On the other side of the pond, in a small English seaside town, Annie and Duncan are immersed in a 15-year, childless, largely loveless relationship of convenience. Duncan loves Juliet, is obsessed with Tucker Crowe and spends all his free time moderating a Website dedicated to \\"Crowology.\\" He's your typical Internet message board nerd -- spending thousands of words discussing every word, phrase and note of Crowe's music, and spending hours speculating about where Crowe is now and whether he might make a comeback.<br /><br />Annie also loves Juliet as a passionate, beautiful piece of music, but doesn't nearly share Duncan's obsession for the musician. She's also beginning to realize she may have wasted the last 15 years of her life with him. The spark for the novel is when a PR person sends Duncan a \\"new\\" Crowe record titled Juliet, Naked --  a stripped down version of the classic Juliet. Duncan's and Annie's opinions vary widely on the new version, which creates more than a little strife in their already failing relationship. On the Website, Duncan posts a 3,000-word gush-fest while Annie posts a less-than-favorable review. Out of the blue, Tucker emails Annie to praise her for her honesty. This touches off a flirty and brutally honest e-mail conversation between the two, and lays the groundwork for the rest of the novel.<br /><br />So, why doesn't the plotting succeed? Part of the reason is that the interesting meditations on music and regret are vastly overshadowed by the banal. The book spends entirely too much time following Tucker's day-to-day life as a stay-at-home dad and chronicling Annie's attempts to arrange a museum exhibit in her home town, among other things. These aside, there just seems to be a tinge of inevitability throughout the entire plot -- like the characters were extensively developed, but then simply dropped into a pre-built plot structure so rigid there's no chance for the unexpected. It seems all the choices Hornby makes regarding the plot are the too-safe ones -- that is until the ending, in which one character finally does something so OUT of character, it's laughable and totally silly.

1563890410|5.0|A return to the epic storytelling and mythology of the series, Season of Mists takes on nothing less than sin, redemption - both personal and religious - and the battle between good and evil. To discuss too much of the plot would ruin some of the rich suprises to come, but Gaiman's usual inventiveness is on full display here, with a gleefully funny and fascinating scene involving intrigue and lobbying by any number of demons and demigods, and a ghost story set in a boys school that's not really like any haunted house tale you've ever read. But in the midst of his sweeping and epic scope, Gaiman never neglects the smaller and more intimate touches, and scenes involving nothing more than an unlikely character commenting on a sunset or an unexpected birth revealing unexpected depths and complexities to Gaiman's creations. It's become apparent, 2/5 of the way through the series, that Gaiman has constructed something akin to a new cosmology and mythology here, and while it's wonderful to get lost in his worlds, it's the surprisingly human characters that keep us enthralled.
078322804X|4.0|The Blues Brothers in my mind should really be considered a hip musical comedy,or am I just blowing smoke here? The entire film has almost non stop music,either that performed by on screen acts or as background filler;so what could be more musical than that? And the acts and talent behind them....it just blows the mind.<br />The plot in the film,like any musical,is just something to hang the songs on but the starring characters here Jake Blues(the late John Belusi) and Elwood Blues(Dan Ackroyd) give the screenplay much more depth than normal and as such raise it above the ordinary.<br />After being released from the Illinois State Pen(Joliet) Jake is met at the gates by brother Elwood.Jake isn't too pleased that his brother sold their old ride for a microphone and bought a used cop car instead,but they're off to see Sister Stigmata,aka the Penguin.It seems the orphanage she runs,in which both the brothers were also raised in,is about to go into foreclosure.The brothers decide to somehow raise the cash to keep it afloat.Jake gets \\"inspired\\" at a local church and they decide to put their old band together.While pursuing their \\"mission from God\\" they raise the ire of the local constabulary,they use every dirty trick to get the band members to re-form,Jake's ex girlfriend pursues them both hell bent on getting them closer to God sooner than they expected,an irate country band whose gig they took and the bar owner who they owe money to give chase and even the Illinois Nazi Party would like to shove their swastika up both their keesters.When they finally get their break and the band plays a huge concert 165 miles from Chicago,they get their money only to be followed all the way back to the County Assessors office in Chicago to pay off the orphanage debt.In the end everyone including the National Guard catches up with them.The orphanage is saved but the brothers both end up in the Pen.The movie musically fades out with the brothers doing,appropriately,\\"Jailhouse Rock\\".<br />This movie is a modern who's who of musical talent,the likes of which will never be seen again in one place.Just some of the personalities that perform;the legendary Hi-De-Ho man himself Cab Calloway,Ray Charles,Aretha Franklin,James Brown and Johnny Lee Hooker.Then there is the on screen band itself:Steve Cropper and Don Dunn formerly of Booker T and the MGs,Willie Hall formerly of the Bar-Kays,Matt Murphy from Howlin Wolf's band and so many others,and the rest of the horns from the Saturday Night Live Band.It is/was an amazing combination of talent and it never fails to impress.The resultant soundtrack from this movie went platinum at least three times that I know of.<br />Of course as we all know the entire concept for the characters came from the fertile mind of Dan Ackroyd and the wildly hailed performances of Ackroyd and Belushi on Saturday Night Live in the late 70s.This SNL sketch-to-movie has been the most successful of all the others to follow.Ackroyd's passion for the music genre itself has been the largest contributing factor in its' initial success and all that has followed;with subsequent live tours with the band and a follow up movie(not as successful as the first).<br />Six actors of note to watch for in the film;John Candy as one of the law enforcement officers,veteran actor Kathleen Freeman as the Penguin,a bit part with \\"Pee Wee Herman\\" Paul Reubens as a waiter,\\"Miss Piggy/Fozzy\\" voice man Frank Oz as the releasing officer in the Pen,singer Steve Lawrence as the brothers agent in the steam room and \\"Laugh-In\\" funny man Henry Gibson as the head of the Nazis.<br />Technically the movie has been transferred well.This is apparently the original cut of the movie when it previewed so it is nice to have the re-inserted footage back into the movie.It now clocks in at about 2 1/2 hours but surprisingly the pace is still pretty good throughout.It is presented in its' original widescreen glory and the special features include an almost hour featurette on the making of the film,the trailer and a still gallery.<br />All in all the Blues Brothers is a clear musical winner.Considered more of a comedy than a musical,I think this film is just so good at what it does that most don't think of this being a musical;but I believe it is just that and a darned good one too.I invite you to look at the techniques of the older \\"gotta sing,gotta dance\\" style movies and you will definitely see styles from every type poured into this one.Besides what it may or may not be there is one thing we can all agree on;the film is a foot tapping, hilarious and enjoyable 2 1/2 hour ride that aims to please,and does!e trailer and a still gallery.

0312370849|5.0|A story not to be missed. Compelling and a tear jerker, that is for sure. I could not put this book down!! Excellent in every aspect.
0545128285|3.0|I was very intrigued by the idea of this book.  I remember the reference to The Tales of Beedle the Bard in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  It was revealed to us to be a storybook of children's `fairy tales' that wizarding families read to their children much as `muggle' families would read Hans Christian Anderson or the Brothers Grimm to their children.<br /><br />I have to admit I rather enjoyed the creativity involved in the tales.  It was kind of fun to read.  Very short, only 107 pages, but these are large-type double-spaced pages.  There are 5 different stories, The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, The Fountain of Fortune, The Warlock's Hairy Heart, Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump, and The Tale of the Three Brothers.  The rest of the book is supposed to be commentary by Albus Dumbledore, but it really just fluff.  Sometimes amusing fluff, but fluff nonetheless.<br /><br />Would I like this book if I had never read Harry Potter?  Probably not.  Was it meant to be a serious work of literature?  Again, probably not.  However, if you read the information about the Children's High Level Group and where the net proceeds of the book are going, it makes you feel good that you bought it.<br /><br />~Jenn

B002WY65VU|5.0|Okay, so ZOMBIELAND is more or less a rip-off of SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  We know.  And no, this film doesn't quite compare.  The entire cast (only four principle actors) give stellar performances, from Woody Harrelson's pitch-perfect take as the match hero; to Jesse Eisenberg's phobic nerd; to Emma Stone's tough girl; to Abigail Breslin's younger tough girl.  There are no cliches (well, none that we can't live with) and there is no miscasting, not even in the stellar cameo that I won't ruin (but other websites will; it was ruined for me long before I saw the film).<br /><br />The film centers around the search for a Twinkie...through a zombie-ridden America.  Yep, that's the plot.  More or less.  As you may have imagined, hi-jinks ensue, and there's quite a bit of gore; this film isn't for the squeamish.  It IS a horror film, after all...but it's a horror comedy, another in a great line of films blending the two genres that used to mingle only accidentally.  ZOMBIELAND stars off on a bit of a slow note (Eisenberg's list of rules gets old rapidly), but it builds itself up to a roaring finish.  It has a few scares and more than a few laughs, and is truly a bloody breath of fresh air that can be enjoyed again and again.
B002V9PEUE|4.0|In \\"Cliffhanger,\\" Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) is a ranger with Rocky Mountain Rescue who finds himself going after a gang of crooks, headed by Qualen (John Lithgow), who have hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane and crash- landed in the Rockies with millions of dollars. The underlying theme is about Gabe losing his nerve because of a tragic accident that occurred during a rescue attempt.  The mountainous location provides many opportunities for vertigo-inducing action scenes, with the nine-minute opening sequence easily the best.  There's an avalanche; a plane crash; rough, frigid weather; a thrilling rescue attempt; and an in-air, plane-to-plane transfer of the stolen money.     Stallone fits his role nicely, but Lithgow steals the film.   Director Renny Harlin manages to keep the pace brisk and incorporate one thrilling sequence after another.  DVD/Blu-ray bonus features include commentary with Stallone and director Harlin, technical crew commentary, deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, storyboards, and theatrical trailer.

B002QW7AJY|4.0|\\"Pandorum\\" is reminiscent of the feature film \\"Alien\\" and the original \\"Twilight Zone\\" TV shows in its expert use of suspense and the unexpected to convey escalating fear.  Two astronauts, Lt. Payton (Dennis Quaid) and Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) wake up in a sleep chamber aboard the seemingly abandoned spacecraft Elysium.  It's pitch black, they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the ship.  They can't remember anything.  Who are they?  What is their mission?  While Payton mans the radio, Bower ventures deep into the ship, attempting to gain a clue to the noises, and discovers they are not alone.     Travis Milloy's script works nicely as mystery/thriller, with revelations doled out and interesting characters introduced along the way -- Nadia (Antje Traue), a defensive woman;  Manh (Cung Le), a non-English-speaking commando; and Leland (Eddie Rouse), who has been awake the longest and might be in greatest danger.   It's difficult not to see similarities between \\"Pandorum\\" and 1979's \\"Alien,\\" which set the standard for horror in outer space.  \\"Pandorum\\" expands on \\"Alien\\" by introducing cannibalism, martial arts, and the title ailment -- a psychological disorder caused by deep space travel, resulting in extreme paranoia.     Director Christian Alvart (\\"Antibodies,\\" \\"Case 39\\") succeeds in creating and sustaining an eerie, dangerous environment that helps raise \\"Pandorum\\" from a mere action picture to an exercise in escalating terror.  The early scenes are best, when the viewer feels the atmosphere but sees little tangible threat.    Unfortunately, Alvart tosses too much into the film.  Rather than developing the story gradually to its final, key revelations, he opts for elaborately choreographed fights, ugly mutant creatures, and a curious, unpredictable affliction that can affect people in peculiar, sometimes frightening ways.   DVD/Blu-ray features include several featurettes, audio commentary by the director, deleted andalternate scenes, a still gallery, and theatrical trailer.

B002UZCJP2|4.0|\\"Surrogates\\" is a futuristic tale of divided identity, treachery, and murder.  Based on the graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele, \\"Surrogates\\" stars Bruce Willis as FBI agent Tom Greer, who lives in a world where robotic surrogates stand in for people, protecting them from violence, disease, and the appearance of aging.  These picture- perfect replicants -- fit, good-looking, remotely controlled machines that assume their operator's life role -- enable the population to experience life vicariously from the comfort and safety of their own homes, giving a sci-fi spin to the notion of \\"couch potato.\\"     Greer and partner Agent Peters (Radha Mitchell) are called in to investigate the mysterious death of a college student whose life ended when his surrogate was destroyed.  When Greer's surrogate is damaged in the investigation, he ventures out of his apartment for the first time in decades.  He must decide who is real and who can be trusted.     Now that James Cameron has provided movie the final word on human duplicates in \\"Avatar,\\" the subject may not resonate as dramatically in \\"Surrogates,\\" but it's a well-made action picture with Willis center stage in his familiar lone-warrior stance.  The theme harks back to one that Stanley Kubrick used memorably in \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" -- depending too much on technology can have dire consequences.  Despite the fact that \\"Surrogates\\" takes place in the future, the world depicted by director Jonathan Mostow resembles a contemporary city, but the combination of sci-fi, action flick, and mystery work well and provide an entertaining ride.     DVD bonus extras include director commentary and the music video \\"I Will Not Bow\\" by Breaking Benjamin.  The Blu-ray edition contains these and the featurettes \\"A More Perfect You: The Science of Surrogates\\" and \\"Breaking the Frame: A Graphic Novel Comes to Life,\\" and four deleted scenes.

B002QFYJF4|3.0|\\"Magnolia,\\"  from director Paul Thomas Anderson (\\"Boogie Nights\\"), takes on the difficult task of focusing on ten major characters who illustrate the film's theme -- that odd things happen all the time and coincidence is inevitable no matter how carefully we plan our lives.  Characters are sent over the brink of polite social behavior by conflicts between offspring and parents, adults against children, employers with employees,  cancer, and fame vs. anonymity.     Julianne Moore and Melinda Dillon play wives to men (Jason Robards, Philip Baker Hall) dying of cancer.  Cocaine addict Claudia (Melora Walters) and former wiz kid Donnie (William H. Macy) are the damaged offspring of cruel parents, while home nurse Phil Pharma (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and cop Jim (John C. Reilly) ooze compassion from every pore.   Most notably, Tom Cruise plays misogynist crusader Frank T.J. Mackey, whose motivational speeches are captivating in style, repulsive in content. The actor has seldom been so fiery on screen.     The problem with \\"Magnolia\\" is its length -- over three hours.  This epic running time allows Anderson to explore each of his characters with some depth, but the film never comes together and, at the final credits, remains a collection of interesting scenes and people thrown into an uncertain mix.  Bonus extras include \\"Magnolia Diary\\" -- a featurette chronicling the making of \\"Magnolia\\" --  a music video, a Frank T.J. Mackey seminar, the infomercial \\"Seduce and Destroy,\\" and a trailer and TV ads.

Academy Award-winner Marcia Gay Harden and Timothy Olyphant join the cast in Season Two.  Following the premier season's legal battle and victory over CEO billionaire Arthur Frobisher (Danson), Patty Hewes (Close) has the legal world at her feet.  Just as she's pondering her next move, Daniel Purcell (Hurt), a man from Patty's mysterious past, re-enters her life, drawing her into a new legal challenge.  What begins as a domestic murder case escalates into the highest reaches of government as Patty unearths a vast conspiracy.  At the same time, Ellen (Byrne), Patty's once ambitious protégé, is on a mission to take Patty down.  Ellen has agreed to be an informant for the FBI in their criminal investigation of Patty and the firm.  Patty must unravel the mystery surrounding Purcell and negotiate the dangers both inside and outside her office.     The raison d'etre of \\"Damages\\" is Ms. Close, who etches a constantly fascinating portrait of the formidable trial lawyer.  Her Patty is intense, intelligent, shrewd, and volatile -- all business one moment, all girlish and playful the next.  Her unpredictability gives the show an edge and distinguishes it from other TV lawyer dramas.     The three-disc DVD contains all thirteen episodes of the second season.   Bonus extras include cast and crew commentaries on selected episodes, deleted scenes, a Season One recap, seven character profiles, and a Season Two Post Mortem in which the creators take a look back at Season Two.

B00000DGSN|5.0|Deep Purple's classic double live album Made in Japan was released in December of 1972 in the UK and sometime in early April of 1973 here in the US.<br />The album was recorded as Deep Purple were touring in support of their classic album Machine Head in Japan in August of 1972 by long-time engineer Martin Birch during the Japanese leg of Purple's Machine Head tour. The versions of the songs that appear on the Made in Japan album were the best performances of each track but gives you pretty much a feel of a near-complete show.<br />We begin the first side of the album with a stellar version of \\"Highway Star\\" which is done with more power and finesse than the studio version as lead singer Ian Gillan sings and screams his heart out and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore plays like a demon possessed. Next is a stellar version of the epic \\"Child in Time\\" which literally destroys its studio counterpart by a longshot. I swear Gillan's screams on here were unearthly and sounding like Satan had taken possession but what a performance. Keyboard player Jon Lord is incredible here as is Blackmore's insane guitar work.<br />The album's original second side kicked off with the definitive version of Purple's signature song \\"Smoke On the Water\\". This version blows the studio version out of the water as it has more guts and power than the studio version. Also, Blackmore gets to stretch out here as does Lord at the end of the track. Next is \\"The Mule\\" which is drummer Ian Paice's killer drum solo and proves he is arguably one of the best left handed drummers in all of rock and roll history and one of the greatest drummers ever.<br />The original double album's second disc and third side starts with a stellar version of \\"Strange Kind of Woman\\" which is an amazing version of that stellar track. We then follow with an excellent version of the Machine Head album track \\"Lazy\\" which has some excellent bass playing from Roger Glover plus Gillan screams his lungs out and plays some mean harmonica. Lastly Messieurs Lord, Blackmore and Paice play the track as if they were playing their last concert.<br />The album's original last side was taken up by an almost 20 minute version, you heard me right 20 minute version, of the classic Machine Head track \\"Space Truckin'\\". This version starts out as a jam before going into a killer version of the track and ending with a 15 minute or so jam with all four band members playing like their lives depended on it with some trippy keyboard effects from Lord and wild guitar pyrotechnics from Blackmore (this was years before he would make guitar smashing an end of show ritual).<br />Made in Japan was also a first in live rock album history as there were NO OVERDUBS whatsoever on the album. Furthermore, much to the chagrin of KISS fans and those who love Alive, Made in Japan was one of the first double albums to chart in the US Top 10 as it reached #6 on the Billboard album charts in 1973 thanks to the live Smoke On the Water and has sold a million plus in the US.<br />In 1998, the album was re-released with a bonus CD in honor of its 25th Anniversary that had THREE KILLER ENCORES. We start with a killer version of \\"Black Night\\" which was released as a B-side. Then a stellar rendition of \\"Speed King\\" which rivals its studio counterpart.

B000002KEV|5.0|Deep Purple's classic double live album Made in Japan was released in December of 1972 in the UK and in January of 1973 in the US.<br />Prior to Deep Purple's Made in Japan, there were a few great live rock albums that had been made (The Who's Live at Leeds, Grand Funk Railroad's Grand Funk Live, The Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out, Allman Brothers Band's Live at Fillmore East and of course Humble Pie's Performance - Rockin the Fillmore) but a majority of live albums recorded uo to 1972 had crummy sonic quality. Made in Japan changed that. The album was recorded as Deep Purple were touring in support of their classic album Machine Head in Japan in August of 1972 by their long serving recording and mixing engineer Martin Birch during the Japanese leg of Purple's Machine Head tour.

B002GU5V24|5.0|The newest box set from Genesis entitled Genesis Live 1973-2007 is a must for all Genesis fans.<br />The box set contains remixed and remastered versions of four of the band's five official live albums which are 1973's Genesis Live, 1977's masterpiece Seconds Out, 1982's excellent Three Sides Live and a re-sequenced/re-edited version of the 2-part 1992/93 release The Way We Walk. The box was overseen by Genesis keyboard player Tony Banks and guitarist/bass player Mike Rutherford and was remastered and remixed by Nick Davis, who worked on the band's previous box sets of studio albums and with Genesis since 1991's We Can't Dance. There's also an empty slot in the box to put in 2007's Live Over Europe so fans wouldn't complain and cry about owning another copy. Also as an added bonus, you get a CD and 5.1 DVD of the band's complete Live At The Rainbow Theater concert from late 1973 (a bulk of the set had already appeared on the 1998 now deleted Genesis Archive 1967-75 box set)! There's also an excellent 52-page booklet, with insights from the band members, stellar in concert photographs of the band taken from many years of live concerts. This box set just kicks.<br />Genesis Live was the band's only proper live album with original lead singer Peter Gabriel (see review). The original release from 1973 had only five songs but is now expanded with five bonus tracks from the 1975 Lamb Lies Down On Broadway show in Los Angeles which had appeared on Genesis Archive 1967-75 being \\"Back In NYC\\", \\"Fly On A Windshield\\", \\"Broadway Melody Of 1974\\", \\"Anyway\\" and \\"The Chamber Of 32 Doors\\". I think this was done as the master tapes which had \\"Supper's Ready\\" from the Genesis Live recordings were lost. Who knows. However, the poorest sounding live disc Genesis ever released now sounds much better.<br />1977's Seconds Out (see review) was the first Genesis double live album with drummer Phil Collins as singer and Chester Thompson as touring drummer and swan song with classic era guitarist Steve Hackett (see review). It was recorded mainly in Paris in 1977 on the Wind and Wuthering tour (sans \\"The Cinema Show\\" recorded in 1976 in Scotland on the A Trick of the Tail Tour with drummer Bill Bruford). The sound is phenomenal and the slipcase packaging is good but the CDs can get damaged from consistently sliding so I put the CDs and DVD in a jewel case so they won't get further damage from sliding in and out. On the initial pressings of this box set Rhino/Atlantic released and many bought from here, there were a couple of CD glitches. The second song on CD 1 \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" starts to play, only to re-start itself before it plays properly (the intro was accidentally attached to the end of \\"Squonk\\" then \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" re-starts). The exact same problem happens again with the second song on CD 2 \\"The Cinema Show\\". The beginning was accidentally attached to the end of \\"Supper's Ready\\". It also begins to play, and then re-starts. Rhino are taking proper steps to correcting the glitches and is offering to send corrected discs to those who have faulty CDs. Just send an email to Rhino's email department and they'll take care of it. I had a defected one but got corrected copy from Rhino in mail and put corrected CDs in a jewel case.<br />1982's Three Sides Live (see review) (was the only live Genesis album to reach the US Top 10 and was the first with touring guitarist Daryl Stuermer) was mostly recorded in 1981 on the Abacab tour in the US and UK, as well as some concluding live material taken from the Duke, And Then There Were Three and A Trick Of The Tail tours respectively. This re-issue replicates the UK release of the album. Happily, the track index problems of the last three tracks that plagued the 1994 remaster have been thankfully corrected.<br />The Way We Walk was recorded on the We Can't Dance tour from 1992 (was almost Phil Collins' final tour with the band until he returned in 2007 along with Stuermer and Thompson). This is a superb re-sequencing of the live album, as the original release cut the album into two separate albums being Volume 1 : The Shorts (which had all of the shorter hit songs) and Volume 2 : The Longs (which had the longer pieces). This new version of The Way We Walk sees the tracklisting re-sequenced to make it like a full show from 1992 on 2-CDs plus adds \\"Turn It On Again\\" to the album (an excellent version I may add as well). Then the songs from the Invisible Touch Tour that were on Volume 1 The Shorts are added at the end of CD 2.<br />The bonus live album Live At The Rainbow 1973 is superb. The highlights are \\"The Cinema Show\\" and \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" which were not released before (\\"Dancing With the Moonlit Knight\\", \\"I Know What I Like\\", \\"Firth of Fifth\\", \\"More Fool Me\\" and \\"Supper's Ready\\" had been issued on Genesis Archive 1967-75). The other two songs being \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" and \\"The Musical Box\\" are on the DVD but left off CD due to time constraints (but are available as free downloads from the official Genesis website if you are a member of Official Genesis fan club). I made a CD of full show with the versions from Live at the Rainbow, the Archive box and the downloads from the official Genesis site onto 2-CDRs and the concert is phenomenal.<br />Insert Live Over Europe into the empty slot (I grabbed another one and why not) and the Genesis live box set is complete!<br />Recommended!live album, as the original release cut the album into two separate albums being Volume 1 : The Shorts (which had all of the shorter hit songs) and Volume 2 : The Longs (which had the longer pieces).

B00008OWZC|4.0|I bought this 3 disc set about a month ago, and have to say that after comparing it to the BBC Sessions this one wins the fight.  Not to condemn the BBC Sessions entirely, but those live performances are just not up to par with this album.  I believe the BBC set is an interesting representation of the band in their earlier days, as opposed to this one which was taken from two different concerts in 1972.  The band is noticeably tighter and more refined after performing together on the live scene for 4 years.  On top of that, I believe the sound quality is better on these discs. To me, the BBC Sessions feel thinner and lack the enthusiasm that How the West Was Won delivers.  I have owned the 2 disc Led Zeppelin concert DVD set for a while as well, and can hear the similarity between this album and the middle performances on that DVD set.  If you enjoy the tunes in the Madison Square Garden and Knebworth portions of the DVD, I think you will enjoy this CD as well.      I give it four stars because I am found wanting to hear live versions of \\"Thank You\\" and \\"How Many More Times,\\" which are not on this set but I know have been bootlegged from these concerts.  Also, some of the songs are ridiculously long and drawn out to a point where they're playing in a different key and a totally different tune.  If you like listening to a song transition into a funky groove for ten minutes so that you forget what song it is, then you might not mind.  It's just a minor thing I'm not crazy about on this compilation.  It's a good representation of Led Zeppelin's live show, but I think it goes too far in a couple songs.    Even with a couple minor setbacks, this album is the best live representation of Led Zeppelin to date if you ask me.  I think hardcore Zeppelin fans will cherish it, and casual Zeppelin fans will appreciate hearing the raw versions of their favorite songs.  Compared to other live Zeppelin albums, How the West Was Won is the way it oughtta be.

0307473465|1.0|No one seems to care this is a book about a female pedophile. It seems the image of female pedophiles in our society are okay but male pedophiles are cast out and condemned as worse than animals. What an awful statement about the double standard in this screwed-up female-worshipping society we live in today. The author and publisher of this book should be condemned for writing and publishing it.     I am not impressed with a story that would let an accused person suffer because the protagonist's character, especially a protagonist who is attending law school, is too weak to speak up concerning the special knowledge he has that would reduce the culpability of the accused...unless the central part of the story was his character and the moral dilemma he was in and subsequent suffering for not have more moral courage to speak out. However, his lack of moral courage does not seem to be the point of the story. In fact, the only point of the story I can ascertain is the cheap propaganda the \\"Holocaust\\" receives upon the 65th anniversary of the end of the war. Only people who enjoy wallowing in the self-imposed misery of Jewish angst should read this book.
B001CGJ3QS|3.0|I remain baffled by the exalted reputation that Kempff enjoys for his late-in-the-day Beethoven cycle. Given any sonata except the lightest and most lyrical, where Kempff's approach is a nice fit, the heroic revolutionary that Beethoven became is little in evidence. I can take any of the great sonatas from the \\"Waldstein\\" and \\"Appassionata\\" onwards (not that very fine ones didn't precede them) and demonstrate easily that Kempff runs a diminished second behind Schnabel, Edwin Fischer, Richter and Serkin for power, strength, integrity, and dramatic impact. (I am less fond of Backhaus, Arrau, and Annie Fischer, but their recordings are also in the same powerful lineage.) As far as raw technique goes, the older Kempff was still ahead of Schnabel but far behind almost any stellar graduate of Juilliard and the Moscow Conservatory today.<br /><br />Wondering if I had caught a legendary pianist past his peak, I purchased the earlier, more esteemed Beethoven cycle that Kempff made in monaural for DG in the early Fifties; I also searched out his mono recordings of various concertos. In fact, there's not that much difference in style. We hear the same artist exercising the same technique to the same ends.  In the decades since his death, Kempff has benefited from the rise of similarly light Beethoven from the HIP crowd (Melvyn Tan, John Lill, Robert Levin, et al.) as well as from conventional pianists who view Beethoven more in the light of Haydn than later Romantics (e.g., Andras Schiff, Richard Goode, Alfred Brendel). The Russians still prefer heroic, Romantic Beethoven in the footsteps of Gilels and Richter, but the former's rather stolid interpretations rank much lower in my estimation than the latter's highly imaginative performances, which at their best are incomparably insightful and dramatic.<br /><br />Today the classicist view of Beethoven seems to prevail, so I doubt that many younger listeners will sympathize with my opinion that Kempff is half a loaf when it comes to Beethoven.  One can find searching performances in the great tradition from Perahia, Pletnev, Fleisher, Barenboim, Kovacevich,and a few other living pianists, but these are hit and miss.  The legacy that began on disc with Schnabel has waned, leaving great monuments behind.to Beethoven.

B0000041DZ|4.0|I come in peace but as a decided unbeliever. The lead reviewer has gotten 100 readers to agree that Brendel's latest Beethoven cycle contains some of \\"the greatest interpretive achievements of the 20th century.\\" Total bosh, of course. Any knowledgeable, experienced collector can set up rivals to any single sonata that Brendel plays and exhibit quite plainly that he is less imaginative than Richter, less authoritative than Schnabel, less powerful than Gilels, and so on. What Brendel represents is a single branch of Beethoven interpretation that is usually known as \\"classicist.\\" Along with Kempff, Richard Goode, and Andras Schiff, among others, Brendel the classicist more often looks backward to Mozart and Haydn than ahead to the Romantics, even though, ironically, the latter owe everything to Beethoven.<br /><br />I do not favor the classicist view beyond early-period Beethoven, and it's astonishing to me that my view -- which was overwhelmingly dominant a generation ago -- has waned so entirely. Schnabel, Richter, Gilels, Backhaus, Edwin Fischer, and Serkin cast long shadows, but they seem to be relegated to the category of monuments. Far more influential is the clean, precise, correct style of Brendel and his school.  One can see why. Correctness is easy, originality is hard. Precision can be spotted by a beginner; it takes experience to appreciate depth.  I'm not here to disparage Brendel but to appreciate him where he belongs, as the first among the classicists.<br /><br />After spending a few hours comparing some representative sonatas (e.g., the Tempest, Appassionata, and Op. 101) I came away with no greater enthusiasm for a style that seems anemic to me. But Goode and even Kempff run second to Brendel if this is the style you favor. He has more oomph and imagination; he is less likely to lapse into dull stretches of faceless note-spinning.  A saving grace of the classicist style is elegance, and Brendel possesses more elegance than his rivals, excepting Kempff at his best. Andras Schiff is more problematic, because he can be quite quirky; correctness isn't one of his salient qualities as it is with Brendel. But to my taste, all of them seriously underplay the middle- and late-period sonatas from th 'Waldstein' and 'Appasisonata' onwards.<br /><br />I imagine this whole review has been an exercise in futility, but I toss it out like a message in a bottle.  It will be a frosty day in June before I lay out money for Brendel's Beethoven (I listen at online sites), but he deserves his high regard and long-held status.ndras Schiff is more problematic, because he can be quite quirky; correctness isn't one of his salient qualities as it is with Brendel.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|I heard Need You Now on the radio and fell in love with Lady Antebellum. I drove straight to the store and bought their CD, and listened to it on the way home and over and over again for the next few weeks. Their melodies, words, harmonies, and voice differences blending like beautiful autumn leaves falling from the trees, are a gift for all of us to enjoy. I then realized that I had purchased their first CD. OMG Need You Now wasn't even out yet so I had a whole other CD to look forward to. YES! I ordered their new CD in December! Huge stars in the making. They write and they sing. I pray that they can take it one day at a time and enjoy the ride. Good luck to Lady Antebellum and a long and happy future in life and music!
B002W1HBN4|5.0|I reviewed the previous edition of Whitney's first album and I gave it only four stars because they did not have the original version of The Greatest Love Of All on it.  The original version is not as electronic for the masses, and it starts out with soft piano chords with Whitney's brilliant voice mixing with it flawlessly.  This original version from the LP is superior to radio version.  The radio version is the same one on her previous Whitney Houston CD and on all her greatest hits albums.  The radio version also was the released 7' single version and video version.  However, this CD was remastered from the original source LP and of course, has the original \\"The Greatest Love Of All\\". That is what we really needed. The price of the CD is worth it just for this original version alone. To hear it remastered, you'll have to lower the volume, since it is done so well. The only typo on the credits is when it lists the lyrics for the brilliant \\"Hold Me\\".  It says 1985, which is when this album came out.  Remember, this duet came out in 1984 on the Love Language album from the late, brilliant Teddy Pendergrass.  However, they didn't forget to put 1977 for The Greatest Love Of All, since George Benson sang that for Muhammed Ali's The Greatest.  Yet, this is really Whitney's signature song, even over \\"I Will Always Love You\\".  True fans know that. The extras are great, but just to have this CD remastered the original way it was on LP is priceless.  Thanks for reading, Joseph<br /><br />We love you Whitney Houston and stay well.  Love always, your fans!

I suggest this book to all of my personal training clients, and those who have gotten on board with the paleo diet have seen amazing results! Another bonus to this way of living that's not really mentioned in the book in an insatiable sex drive for both men and women! Again, a definite must have!
B002QW7ALM|3.0|Imagine: you wake up from hypersleep in the dead of space, with no memory of who you are or where you are.  This is the predicament Bower (Ben Foster) finds himself in.  Soon he regains some memory, and encounters Payton (Dennis Quaid), who also cannot remember where they are or how they got there.  Of course, this is a horror movie, and soon memory loss is the least of these guys' problems: their ship is inhabited with a race of fierce, fast creatures that have a taste for human flesh, and who seem to be almost impossible to stop.  Duhn-duhn-duhn...<br /><br />Okay, so maybe I simplified things a bit.  PANDORUM has a great premise; unfortunately, after a while that premise kind of withers away, until the film becomes something of a creature feature.  I'd compare it to THE DESCENT, another great-starting horror film that petered out about halfway through.  Fortunately, PANDORUM picks itself up again near the end, with a couple of twists that, if not amazing, are at least interesting and enjoyable.  And throughout, we get the solid acting of Ben Foster; he pretty much carries this film, and is really the sole reason to watch.  Quaid's performance is also strong, especially as his character develops, but it's Foster who shines in a script riddled with some cheesy dialog and predictable scares.  The atmosphere is intense (though not as claustrophobic as it should be, perhaps), and the creature-effects (actual actors in makeup, thank God) are above-par, though I don't understand how everyone on board the ship (with the exception of Bower and Payton) knows karate.  There are also a few plot points never fully realized or explained, and that leads to a somewhat disappointing ending.  Still: If you're a fan of the genre, you'll like the film, and it's certainly worth watching.  Foster's performance is the strongest point here, but like I said, if you enjoy the genre, you'll enjoy this film.
B001POAVZE|5.0|There is something to like on each of FF's albums, but what really sets apart \\"Tonight\\" is the fact that the entire album is better than average. There is not a single song that i have to skip. From top to bottom you have single-worthy songs except for a couple slower songs at the end.<br /><br />But the absolute best thing about this album is LUCID DREAMS. I had never seen FF live before i bought this, and i had no idea that the song had been around for a while as a special treat for live shows.<br /><br />But after listening to that song my life was changed. It is unlike any song i have ever heard. It is unlike previous FF songs. It is a sonic masterpiece that i have listened to ATLEAST 5 times EVERY SINGLE DAY for the last 5 months. The song never gets old. Every single time i reach the chorus i cant help but sing along with a giant grin on my face. It is the kind of song that 40 years from now it will still have the same energy.<br /><br />Considering how utterly awesome Lucid Dreams is, i would pay $100 for this album just so i could hear musical perfection before i die
1416583408|5.0|Interesting introduction to the science of dog behavior, interspersed with sweet anecdotes about the author's own dog.  Incredibly well written to boot.  To the people complaining about the need for more science, I think you are criticizing the book for not being something that it is not actually trying to be.  The author is clearly knowledgeable in her field, and does provide a hefty dose of science, but her audience is the average dog-owner, who is not a scientist.  I found the book totally fascinating.  And it provided me with a good foundation for further reading into dog behavior -- which I am inspired to do by this book!
B001KZVQJI|5.0|This review is for the Blu-Ray release. I just finished watching the extended version of this film on Blu-Ray and I thought it was amazing. Universal's transfer of this epic onto Blu-Ray is a show piece for the Blu-Ray format. The picture is crystal clear and vibrant in color. The CGI effects in this film are fantastic. The sound design transferred over to the DTS Master HD codec is among the best on Blu-Ray today. The sound has many sweeping effects that will give your surround sound system a complete workout.     Some reviews are critical on Jackson's film because it differs from the original or the performances were not up to snuff etc... Like this version or not as far as story and performances there is no way you can honestly say a negative thing about the look and sound of this film on Blu-Ray; it is nothing short of great. Props to Universal for giving such nice treatment to the Blu-Ray release of this film.
B00009Y3L4|1.0|I tried it in 1972; it was a stinker.  Now I've tried it again and find that nothing has changed.  Many sporty fellows, of course, adore it; it seems to be magnetic for that taste.

B002VJ0576|4.0|I love this kind of movie. Just a tiny bit hokey, but earnest with great chemistry between the actors.    Sherlock Holmes doesn't disappoint. Ben Syder and Gareth David-Lloyd work well together as Holmes and Watson, alternating between affectionate and snarky.     The Welsh locations double well for Victorian London. The scenery is often breathtakingly lovely.     The plot is interesting to say the least. There's a moment about three-fourths of the way through that had me reaching for the subtitle key (which there aren't any) to see if I'd heard it right. It was explained in the end. No, it wasn't a dialog blooper, and was pretty funny when the punchline was delivered.     Yes, there are monsters and some of the plot is pretty far fetched. But there are also some genuinely harrowing moments and clever dialog.     Enjoy.
0786868724|5.0|I recently read this on my flights to and from home, for Christmas. I really enjoyed the book, and would recommend this to everyone. It's about faith, but even more than that, it's about being Human, getting to know someone, believing in people and life.
0393075966|4.0|Freefall is a fantastic overview of the crisis from both the multitude of causes to the social fabric that created the backdrop.  Stiglitz in a fairly concise book, manages to discuss a lot of issues with a lot of clarity.  It describes incentive misalignment, the abuse of barganing power by those who had it during the crisis under asymmetric informaiton, the failure of prices to reflect true costs, the abundance of negative externalities and market failures that inherintly exist and even the degredation of our social contract in promoting general well being.  The book is not written in two parts but the contents of the book are sort of split into two categories.      The first part of the book is really a description of the causes of the crisis.  It describes some of the specific actions taken by bankers, the incentives to take fees irrespective of the value add of the underlying contracts, and how that evolved into model \\"arbitrage\\" abuse in mortgage repackaging.  It discusses the change in the distribution of wealth in the country and the stagnation of wages for most of the country despite general GDP growth that hides that fact, in particular the transfer of wealth from \\"main street to wall street\\".  It discusses the failure of central bankers to address the bubbles of the economy and how their economic principles were too often based on faulty neo-classical principles.  It then goes into how the crisis was used as an opportunity to hold the taxpayer \\"hostage\\" in the same way that one can price gouge a pedestrian for a ride in a hurricane.  This part of the book prepares the unfamiliar reader with the much needed backdrop to understand most of the crisis.    The second part of the book starts off where the current events end and tries to set the scene for the steps we need to take for the future.  This was the best part of the book for me.  Stiglitz outlines many of the important principles that are violated in the neo-classical world that makes it apparant, desire for incremental benefit does not imply an aggregate improvement for the economy.  Stiglitz makes a strong effort to show market failures are rife, the cost of a crisis as an example far exceeded the profit generated by fees, and as a result leaning on - \\"the market is better than regulators in forming solutions\\", clearly needs to be re-thought.  It is hard to disagree...  Stiglitz also discusses less in depthly but importantly nonetheless, the ecological economic principles that we are missing today- in particular the true \\"cost\\" of consumption as a tax on the future with resource scarcity as well as environmental damage.  I dont think these are particularly contentious but they are often forgotten.  Aspects of behavioural finance are brought up and the cognitive dissonance of financiers responses are described.  Stiglitz ends with a call to action society at large to take the recent failure as an opportunity to ammend our social contracts and revitalize our trust and institutional arrangements.  The need for better regulation he believes is truly clear and the recent crisis needs to be taken as a reason to fundamentally change the way our economy is structured, from capital/labour distribution to consumption investment balance (investment in both fixed assets as well as human capital).    This book is so far one of the most insightful I have read.  I agree with a lot of the commentary but let me quickly go into why I dont think its quite five stars.  The author is often a bit unbalanced in the criticism, of both central bankers as well as those in finance.  Most of the book goes on about the almost inherent total disregard for any other people's interests by the bankers involved, but then later it contextualises their actions and describes their actions as a function of their environment and incentive set- making them more a time and place phenomenon than the bad people they are painted as elsewhere.  Central bankers too are berated, but they arent incentivisedby the pay.  Hindsight is 20/20 and although some were very impressive with their foresight of the problems, it is hard to uniformly make out as though central bankers are all fools.  The end goal of this book is to try to argue for a change in social architecture and institutional arrangement.  Currently incentives are misaligned, the markets fail and we deal with things after rather than pre-emptively.  If this is the goal then this book should have been written inclusively for all readers.  I find it quite exclusionary for most in finance and many in politics.  That is not that sensible given the goal is to convince.  That being said, some scolding is in order, but the magnitude and the one-sidedness is a bit frustrating, predatory lending was a real phenomenon, but assuming away the responsibility by the many individuals speculating on property is not a fair evaluation.  All in all the economics of the crisis are evaluated excellently, the conclusions can be debated, but in my opinion they are extremely valuable and provide an important framework to consider for the future.  Alot is accomplished in this book and most of it is convincingly argued, this book is a very valuable addition to our recent crises's literature.
076790592X|5.0|Read it, you will understand why it was on the best sellers list.  Great book to read again. I always enjoy it.  I love all of Mitch Albom's Books.
0307454541|5.0|I have not read a better set of books than the Steig Larsson trilogy. I couldn't get the third book, The Girl who kicked the  hornets nest in the U.S. , so I ordered it from a U.K. internet seller.<br /><br />Quite simply the trilogy is a masterpiece. I will not bore you with my feeble criticisms of the books because I do not have any. I read all the notable books that come out and this one absorbed me like a few books I read as a young reader, with imagination on fire and absorbing everything and I got the same feeling reading these books, but years later and without youthful hormones raging.<br /><br />I don't know anything about the author except that he had a politically correct job title, but I wish that he had been published early and often. His work is sublime!

B002XMGGJM|5.0|Law Abiding Citizen is a smart new suspense thriller movie available on Blu-ray from Anchor Bay on February 16, 2010.  Directed by F. Gary Gray, the film stars Gerard Butler as Clyde Shelton, a father whose wife and daughter are killed while he is tied up.  When lawyer Nick Russo (Jamie Foxx) works out a plea bargain with the 'real' killer who testifies against his accomplice, Shelton feels like the legal system wronged his family.    Ten years later, Shelton returns to seek revenge against the man he blamed for his family's death.  Law Abiding Citizen is not your typical man seeks revenge thriller.  Shelton has much greater plans than taking out one man.  Instead, he intends to punish everyone involved in what he believes is a corrupt and bureaucratic legal system.    When Nick and his cohorts discover that Clyde is more than just a wronged man, and that his background is designing and developing killing machines, they realize they are in trouble.  Clyde begins to systematically kill everyone he blames for the death of his wife and daughter.  Unwilling to break the law and kill Clyde in cold blood, Nick struggles to figure out how Clyde is killing from prison and how to outsmart his intelligent nemesis.    Law Abiding Citizen is a brilliant and intelligent action film with a clever and original concept.  The audience is perplexed by a difficulty in deciding which side of the story to be on.  Initially, your natural reaction is to root for the emotional revenge of a man who lost his wife and daughter.  However, as the story carries on, Clyde takes on more of a villainous role and Foxx's character comes forward as the film's protagonist.    If you want an action-packed, smart, and entertaining suspense movie of a new mold, Law Abiding Citizen is a must-see Blu-ray release for you.  The Blu-ray includes a variety of cool special features and bonuses.  You get the Unrated Director's Cut with commentary and interviews.    Law Abiding Citizen Blu-ray Review by Neil
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I don't know why everyone doesn't give this DVD 5 stars.  Honestly, this workout gives me the best 40 minute total conditioning that I need.  Erin is a great trainer, her workout is straight forward and to the point.  She doesn't have difficult positions - although the workout itself is difficult!  I still have trouble doing all the reps - but she is pushing me!  I didn't workout for the first 14 weeks of my pregnancy, and now am 22 weeks along.  Between her DVD and Summer Sanders I am on my way to at least feeling moderately in shape again.    Couldn't rave about this video more - buy it - it's worth every penny!
B002VKE0XA|4.0|A lot of people are giving this a bad review. I think they did what The Blair Witch was supposed to, make you feel like you are watching someone's demise on tv. It starts out slow and very mundane, almost as if a couple is actually taping themselves. As it goes on, the occurrences get a little more intense. I disagree with many people that the best parts were in the commercial, those were only snippets. You have to go in thinking this is a real videotape edited by someone who found it. Ignore the acting, or reasoning behind what the people are doing. Most people are oblivious to danger until it's in their face and probably would act the way these people did because most people don't believe in the paranormal. Watch it, take it for what it's worth and use your imagination.
B000VNMMQ6|4.0|SPOILER:  Don't get me wrong, this was an excellent action film. It has everything: Guns, Helicopters, car-chases, car-chases down elevators, French Ninjas, and one bald man. But the unrated version is simply the way the film was supposed to be. For anyone who has watched ANY of the Die Hard's, you know that the film needs to be rife with M*****F*****'s (which have been editted out, EVEN AT THE CLIMAX! I almost yelled at my TV)    I am hoping for an Unrated Blu-Ray version of this movie.
0312370849|2.0|The background, story, and historical information was very interesting. There is some degree of truth in the French roundup being something lost to history, I had never heard of it before. But the writing is so sloppy and undeveloped. I felt like I was reading a middle schooler's history report. When it took a turn toward the end into sentimental drivel, ugh. Quick read, but certainly not the life-changing novel some reviewers make it out to be.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This was an epic movie, and having it on BluRay is even better, especially the scenes that are filmed at the IMAX aspect ratio (Pay attention to the IMAX scene in the Carribbean-esque part where you can see each individual wave...I caught myself drooling)     As far as the Bonus Features disc goes...everything on here was played a million times on TV prior to the theater release, so you haven't missed anything really...    Highly Recommend the Single-Disc
0446569895|5.0|Ozzy is courageous and honest enough to admit he is an alcoholic and drug addict. He, his wife Sharon, his kids and the animal kingdom are glad he is sober. Some of this stories he tells you are awful and really not funny but when he takes out the chicken population on his property, his next door neighbor, a Brit has a sane response that some how makes you laugh although the story is horrific .  There are other stories that make you want to be a vegetarian if you are not already.<br /><br />He has been through hell and back.  He has also inflicted hell but he is proof in the healing power of love and also humor.<br /><br />Ozzy got it right late in his life and sobered up. He knows how much he loves his family and he is just a funny, winning person.  I listened to the audio of this and it was a terrific listen as well.  A dear friend who has lost his brother loves Ozzy and was happy to tell me he was going to his book signing.  He said if he had to make a wish for the make a wish foundation it would be to meet Ozzy.  Note: My friend did get his magic moment; Ozzy had his head down signing fast and furious.  My friend thanks Ozzy for his contribution - I can't quote his words but Ozzy looked up and thanked my friend.  That is Ozzy. A winner.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|Note, I am only commenting about the box set itself and not the price. The transfer over to blu-ray is superb. As amazing as the video looked, I was equally impressed by the surround sound that game a truly immersive experience. These films can make a true case for being Matt Damon's greatest work.
0385523904|5.0|Honestly, I have heard so little about North Korea except for what I hear on the news or read in the paper about the political side of things. \\"Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea\\" was an eye opener. I feel so sad for the people there.<br /><br />The challenges Barbara Demick faced and succeeded in overcame in order to do the  interviews and research for this book are admirable. Even though I live a relatively simple life on my Social Security Disability income I actually feel as if I do live a privileged life. Ms. Demick's book definately had an impact on my view of the world as a whole and what freedom really is.<br /><br />While reading \\"Nothing to Envy\\" I was drawn into the book and could feel the stiffled limitation of thoughts, of expression, of being free to walk down the street and be who I am, to talk to anyone I want, to be me all without fear of who is watching or overhearing.<br /><br />An \\"in your face\\" education as to what life is like in North Korea. A must read book for anyone wishing to learn more about those who we barely know about and share the planet with us.
0141000198|5.0|So I picked up Bridget Jones's Diary because I just simply wanted to read and laugh a little and enjoy a lot and I was not disappointed. I have seen the movies and I definitely enjoyed them - but I've always wanted to get a deeper feeling for Bridget and thus the book has been one that I've wanted to read for quite some time now.<br /><br />Bridget Jones's Diary is just that - her diary entries which span a year in time. Every entry not only has what's going on in her life but also counts her calories, cigarette intake, and how much booze she drinks. Now let me tell you that just those little numbers were a crack-up. You could definitely tell what kind of a day she was having by how many cigarettes or how many drinks she had.<br /><br />There were so many things that I truly enjoyed about this book:<br />Characters that I could relate to; weighing oneself every single day, being infatuated with a guy who's no good for you, knowing it, and still obsessing over him to the point where you get no work done; good friends who love and protect you and will do anything for you (including lie to you) if the need arises; parents who try to hook you up with anyone of the opposite sex because they are terrified that you are spiraling headfirst into spinsterhood.<br /><br />Bridget Jones's Diary is all that it was said to be and more. It is funny and original with a likable, funny, yet slightly neurotic heroine... just the way I like them.<br /><br />I'll end it at this, it was V. good. :)
B0034JKZ3G|2.0|This laudable attempt by Disney to return to the days of 2-D animated glory sadly falls short. Instead of surrounding its newest character - the first black Disney \\"princess\\" (which is rather deceptive, since Tiana is not a princess at all) with fresh new ideas, characters and music, Disney chose to use the hoary old schticks and gimmicks it's used in the past. The \\"I want\\" song - check. Prince - check. Talking animals - check. Funny sidekicks - check. Musical numbers - check. A dash of tragedy to give the the script some heft - check. Charismatic villain - check. Yep, all the stock Disney characters and plot points are abundant in this film, but the result is less than satisfying. Tiana herself is a charmer - when she's human - but once she becomes kin to Kermit, she becomes bland and humorless, perhaps to avoid upstaging her equally bland and unlikable Frog Prince Naveen. Granted, he's self-centered enough to generate more personality than many Disney animated leading men, but when it comes to warmth and appeal, he's no Aladdin. Even worse, the sidekick and ancillary characters are hardly memorable: a Baloo-wannabe oafish alligator, a spoiled Southern belle, a feckless firefly and an old hag who likes to kiss her pet snake on the mouth. Ecchhh. The music is subpar, with only one song that stands out: \\"Almost There\\", a decent addition to the Disney catalogue of \\"I Want\\" songs, but which pales in comparison to similar songs from Disney's past anthems of ambition, such as \\"I Just Can't Wait To Be King\\" (The Lion King) or even \\"Someday My Prince Will Come\\" (Snow White). All in all, \\"Princess and the Frog\\" (worst Disney movie title ever) is not a bad film, but it's far from being a Disney classic. I'd rank it in the same class as \\"The Lion King 1 1/2\\" or \\"Cinderella 2\\", both of which were decent efforts, but not worthy of inclusion to the roster of Disney-dusted classics such as \\"Pinocchio\\". 2 stars.
032147404X|4.0|i bought this book for a friend who is \\"into\\" photography, yet didn't have any background on how film photography works vs. digital photography, film theory, etc. This book is really informative, has great illustrative step by steps,and gives the reader a good grasp. Very instructional,not hard to  understand.
B0000UJL96|4.0|After the commercial and critical EPIC failure of part 5, they almost stopped the franchise.  They had several ideas for a new movie, possibly a new series.  They almost greenlit a prequel called Starfleet Academy, but the project was shelved (although they did take some ideas from it for the 2009 reboot).  Leonard Nimoy then came up with an idea for a sixth movie.  He asked \\"what if the wall came down in outer space?\\"  He was referring to the events of the cold war.  So they decided to follow his suggestion and produce a sixth Star Trek movie.  Many people consider this one of the best Star Trek movies, and some people consider to be on the same level as \\"Wrath of Khan\\".  I like this movie, but I don't like it as much as parts two or four.  It think it is about on the same level as Search for Spock.  It's a good Star Trek movie, but there are better.    The movie takes place a few years after the events of part five.  In the time since the last movie, Sulu has been given his own command, the starship Excelsior.  Also, the crew of the Enterprise is a few weeks away from retirement.  The events of the previous movie are not even mentioned.  It's like they were saying \\"well, we really screwed up last time.  We'll just pretend like that movie never happened, okay?\\"  And that's fine with me.  They try to carry on the themes from the trilogy, which was a wise move on their part.  The movie opens with Sulu and the Excelsior discovering that a Klingon moon has exploded.  The moon, Praxis, was the Klingon empire's key energy production facility, and the Klingon Empire is now thrown into turmoil.  They request a peace treaty with the Federation.  Kirk and the Enterprise are ordered to meet with Chancellor Gorkon and escort him to earth.  This is difficult for Kirk, seeing as how his son David was killed by Klingon's a few years earlier.  Nevertheless, Kirk tries to be polite to the Klingons, and has them aboard the Enterprise for dinner, in a great, comical scene.  Kirk meets Gorkon's daughter Azetbur, and his chief of staff General Chang.  Chang seems particularly interested in Kirk, seeing him as fellow warrior.    As they near earth, the Enterprise suddenly appears to fire on the Klingon ship.  Then two men in space suits beam onto the Klingon ship.  They kill several Klingons, including Gorkon.  Kirk beams over to the Klingon ship, and he and McCoy are sent to a prison planet.  They later escape and try to figure out who framed them.  They deduce that it was not the Enterprise who attacked Gorkon' ship, it was a Klingon ship that can fire while cloaked.  The two men who beamed over to the Klingon ship and killed Gorkon were two Enterprise officers.  Kirk and crew uncover a plot to stop the peace talks.  They plan another execution at the peace conference.  They head to the peace conference to intervene, but are intercepted by Chang and the cloaked bird of prey.  He fires on the Enterprise, severely injuring it.  Spock and McCoy modify a torpedo which tracks the invisible bird of prey and blows it up.  Then they beam down to the peace conference just in time to save the Federation president from being assassinated.  All charges against Kirk and his crew are dropped, and they are ordered to return home.  However, they decide to go on one final cruise before they are decomissioned.    As I said before, this is a satisfying end to the first series of Star Trek movies.  It has Kirk once again having to deal with getting old.  He also has to get over his own bigotry and accept what is happening with the Klingons.  I don't think this movie is one of the best Trek movies, but it is still a great movie and a great sendoff for the crew of the original series.
1595141715|4.0|This book held my interest enough that I read it in one night. She shares stories with the main character that are so real and in some cases were real for me. I would definately read it again once I get the time. Probably not the best book in the world but not bad. I could see Lifetime turning it into a movie. In high school my senior year, a classmate committed suicide and he sent out letters in a manner similar to how she did. Throughout the whole book I couldn't help but wonder what they said? why he did it? how did the people who got the letters effect him? Did I ever make some kind of impact on him? I guess it just makes you think about how you never know what a person could be going through and how we brush it off like its nothing but another grumpy person. I would recommend this for sure.
0446569895|5.0|I read Nikki Sixx's book and Slash's as well.  While I enjoyed them, the constant page after page of drug stories was a bit much. I wanted to get to know them.  In this book, I am Ozzy, there are drug references however the book opens up the soul of the man.  It was a very honest, and open book and it was hard to put down once I started reading it.
B002NXSRVG|2.0|Going into this movie I honestly thought it was going to be terrible move, maybe 1 star or worse, but I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. That being said I wouldn't pay to see it in the theater I'd wait till it comes out on DVD and rent it.    The story was bad and had major plot holes or didn't make any sense, but what can you expect from a Stephen Sommers movie(As you can tell I really don't like the his directing/writing).    The acting was decent with Dennis Quaid(General Hawk), Christopher Eccleston(Destro). He's also good in Doctor Who. Byung-hun Lee(Storm Shadow) and Ray Park(Snake Eyes). Though Sommers and the rest of the writers destroyed their great stories from they had from the cartoon and comics. As for everyone else from Channing Tatum to Marlon Wayans pretty much sucked.    Action/Special Effects I thought were the best part of the film. The high not was the battle in Paris which was great. The other action scenes were visual good but weren't well executed especially the underwater one.    Now for my tangent on the so call director Stephen Sommers. Back to my first question. Can Stephen Sommers direct, and the overwhelming evidence says NO!    Lets look at the list of films he has directed.    Deep Rising, The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Van Helsing, and GI Joe. The only film that I though was above mediocre was The Mummy which I gave 3 1/2 stars. The rest were Mediocre to terrible.    Now lets look at all the things he's written/screenplay.    Deep Rising, The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, The Scorpion King, Van Helsing, and G.I. Joe. Again the only really decent film was The Mummy. Is he the worst director/writer out there of course not but he is really bad.    Now if this movie manages to make enough money to garner a sequel. Which I truly think is in question. Here are a few things their going to need to do to bring me back.    1. Get rid of Stephen Sommers. There are a lot better directors than him.    2. Get ridof Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans. They were two of the worst actors in this film.    3. Make the third film better. I'd say less is more. You don't have to have these over the top actions scenes to have make entertaining movie. Also add move depth to the characters like Snake Eyes  , Scarlet and Destro. Last thing add more drama and suspense.    If the producers can do the majority of this I'd be on board for another film other wise this potential franchise is done.
B001I5M9SC|5.0|I'm not so much a fan of that kind of music and I'm more rock oriented. I bought initially this DVD for my parents in law who are both Italian and Bocelli/Pavarotti fans, but this DVD just became overnight the very best item of my whole DVD collection, not to speak about the impact on my parents in law who still can't believe it. If I could have put 6 stars here, I would have done so. Everything is just perfect in this record:  sound, image, performance, musical skills of every single musician and especially Sarah Brightman whom I didn't know before. I'll closely watch her career from now on and I'm just praying these two wonder voices will again join together one of these days.
0307266303|3.0|i picked up the audiobook version of Born to Run based on a recommendation from a friend after finishing my first marathon with considerable knee pain.  and besides that, it had received some really great reviews and mentions that i had seen elsewhere, as well. after listening to Haruki Murakami's What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, i had high hopes for another inspirational book for and about runners, but unfortunately was a little let down.<br /><br />the book, written by a journalist for Esquire and Men's Health (among other well known magazines), tends to write as you'd expect any good journalist would, with loads of research information presented in quick bursts to grab your attention. but, i don't think that panned out for an enjoyable overall book experience.  the article-like chapters, once sewn together, seemed so disjointed, and although the various stories were both interesting and well presented, the editorial work just jumbled it all up.  this, for me, resulted in a presentation that took away from what i thought would have been the goal of the book - to depict how the human species is, in fact, evolutionarily developed and born to run.<br /><br />  \\"The running man: so simple. Just move your legs, because if you don't think you were born to run, you're not only denying history, you're denying who you are.\\"<br /><br />in addition to the clunky format, the focus of the book didn't meet my expectations.  despite the title, the book seemed to be less about running, and more about people who happened to run.  don't get me wrong here - i enjoyed the book, for the most part.  i had just hoped for more.  my only other gripe with the book was that it felt split between a memoir and non-fiction, due to some possible exaggerations, poor references and sometimes sketchy conclusions.  if the book had been listed as a memoir, there would be no complaints here, but i don't think it really stands up to being a great non-fiction book.<br /><br />so, what did i like about the book?  well, the information was interesting, to say the least.  the book spans several fascinating subjects, including the runners of the Tarahumara Indians in South America, professional ultra-distance runners, the origins of long distance running events, the advent of running shoes and how it impacted running related injuries, and, of course, the evolutionary development of the human body and how it relates to running.  the cast of characters is lively, from the mysterious, elusive Caballo Blanco, to the two crazy college kids that find Trouble (with a capital T) everywhere they turn.<br /><br />probably the most controversial (or enlightening, possibly) components of the book are in its clear advocacy for the benefits of barefoot running.  some pretty bold statements were aimed directly at modern shoe companies (*cough* Nike *cough*) and how their marketing has inflicted a lot of damage on the running culture, by making running more painful and less enjoyable.<br /><br />  \\"A lot of foot and knee injuries that are currently plaguing us are actually caused by people running with shoes that actually make our feet week, cause us to over-pronate, give us knee problems. Until 1972 when the modern athletic shoe was invented by Nike people ran in very thin soled shoes, had strong feet and had much lower incidence of knee injuries.  And the cost of those injuries? Fatal disease in epidemic proportions. Humans really are obligatorily required to do aerobic exercise in order to stay healthy, and i think that has deep roots in our evolutionary history.  If there's any magic bullet to make human beings healthy, it's to run.\\"<br /><br />ultimately, i think that if the book had been titled differently, i would have had different expectations and maybe had a different takeaway, but as it stands, i constantly found myself being distracted because of the title and the narrative.  a more appropriate title might have been something like `Short Stories on the Questto Pain/Injury Free Running', since that seemed to be the primary goal of the entire book.<br /><br />despite everything, i would still recommend this book to my runner friends.  if nothing else, it did get me amped about running and presented a lot of good information to get you thinking.<br /><br />  \\"You don't stop running because you get old.  You get old because you stop running.\\"<br /><br />so, on that note, i'm going running.e the primary goal of the entire book.    despite everything, i would still recommend this book to my runner friends.  if nothing else, it did get me amped about running and presented a lot of good information to get you thinking.        \\"You don't stop running because you get old.  You get old because you stop running.\\"    so, on that note, i'm going running.

As far as Auto-tune...I can usually spot it very well, and either it's very subtle, maybe  there are some studio fixes, OR it just ain't there...because normal auto-tune is very easy to spot.

B0000DZ3EN|3.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />I distinctly remember this movie being marketed as a sequel to the Judy Garland classic \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"  I was excited about that as a seven year old, as I already loved that movie.  However, after I left the theatre I was scared and confused, as it does not resemble its more upbeat and famous predecessor hardly at all.<br /><br />Starring Fairuza Balk(\\"Almost Famous\\"), Nicol Williamson, Jean Marsh(\\"Willow\\")and Piper Laurie this is a moderately entertaining movie.  Generally best viewed by older children and adults, it finds Dorothy Gale undergoing shock treatment at a turn-of-the-century(19th to 20th)mental hospital for her insistent stories about Oz.  A mysterious girl assists in Dorothy's escape from the cruel hospital, and eventually Dorothy is back in Oz, albeit a very different Oz.<br /><br />I now know it was studio politics which insisted this movie be marketed as a sequel to the original Garland film.  This was a mistake as it underlines comparisons between the movies, and doesn't allow this one to breathe on its own merit.  It does indeed have merit, as being the only major studio movie I know of to feature L. Frank Baum's original characters Princess Mombi and The Nome King, among many others.  Substituting for The Wicked Witch of The West and The Wizard, respectively, Mombi and The Nome King make the scariest components of these predecessors seem tame and quaint.  Mombi, in particular, harbors a grotesque collection of disembodied heads which she periodically alternates on her own body.  This feature should have made this movie automatically rated PG-13 instead of the PG it is in the United States.  To be fair, though, I'm not 100% sure the PG-13 rating was in existence when the movie first came out.<br /><br />This movie has significantly grown on me over time.  Now that I've read some of the original \\"Oz\\" stories by Baum, I have more respect for it than I ever had before.  This movie is much truer to the spirit of those works than the Judy Garland movie ever was, and in a certain light, even makes that great film look bad for its whitewashed deviations from the source material.  This movie is lacking in one serious respect, though, and that is in the storytelling flexibility that makes a good movie a great one.  In the end, it's just too dark and serious for its own good.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|I thought this quite \\"badly done.\\"  When you take a pastiche of dialog from various novels and claim to have lived with Jane Austen for most of your life, but use the adverb form for \\"monstrous,\\" it seems to me a dead give away that you actually know the novels much less well than claimed.  It is \\"monstrous\\" if you are trying to use english as Jane Austen used it, NOT \\"monstrously.\\"
B000A2IPP0|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />I am old enough(barely)to remember the first release of \\"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\\" back in 1982.  I was four years old, and on vacation with my family to see my aunt in Baytown, Texas.  It was the first movie I ever saw in a theatre, and I remain thankful for having seen this on a big screen at a young age.<br /><br />Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore and Robert MacNaughton, the movie tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a young boy named Elliott and an alien.  That is a very rough outline, but the ingeniousness of the movie is the emphasis of the deep need for connection and understanding between people.  Elliott is loved, but frustrated by an absentee father and the typical harrassments of an older brother named Michael, played well by Robert MacNaughton.  Additionally, Elliott must contend with the responsibility of occasionally looking after his younger sister Gertie, played by a very young and endearing Drew Barrymore.  E.T. unceremoniously lands in Elliott's life and care after being unintentionally stranded on Earth by his kind, and the flowering of their relationship remains one of the most moving in the history of popular film.<br /><br />All of the younger actors in this movie give exceptional performances, but Henry Thomas' Elliott remains among the best child performances ever put on film.  Mr. Thomas plays Elliott as if the character were a genuine boy, and naturally elicits sympathy and believability.<br /><br />Also featuring a superlative soundtrack by the great film composer John Williams(the \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Indiana Jones\\" and \\"Harry Potter\\" film series'), and impressive visual effects punctuated by a couple of famous bicycle flights, \\"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\\" is a great classic film that I never tire of watching.  (And yes, I did cry at the end, all those years ago).
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I am an avid reading and couldn't wait for the next Dan Brown book. I even bought in hard cover which I do for very few authors. I wanted to love this book. I kept reading thinking it has to get better but it didn't. To say The Lost Symbol was a disappointment is an understatement.  Now to be fair some of the Masonry information was interesting and quite accurate. But the endless descriptions of traveling from one place to another and the ridiculous way the police act including giving Robert a ring from a crime scene just wasn't worth my time or money.  The ending was just stupid and insulting to anyone who has the least bit of intellectual thought. If you have to read it defiantly wait for the paperback.
B001VG4LKW|5.0|Manjit Kumar's book is a fascinating history of one of the most<br />fundamental areas of science.Just as the title says, it is a history<br />of the great debate about the nature of reality with Einstein and<br />Neils Bohr leading the opposing views. Quantum Mechanics has always<br />been a fascinating subject for me, mainly because I could never hope<br />to understand it enough, however much time I spent on it. This<br />brilliant work takes you through the history of the ideas behind<br />quantum mechanics from the late 19th century all the way till the<br />latter half of 20th century.<br />Manjit Kumar sets the stage slowly as he describes the contributions<br />of great scientists ranging from Rutherford, Max Planck, Einstein,<br />Bohr, de Broglie, Pauli, Heisenberg, Dirac and Schroedinger. Their<br />works are captured along with a short historical background to provide<br />the context. Then the stage is all set for the great question about<br />the nature of reality. Bohr and Heisenberg and many others insist that<br />there is no objective reality. Bohr says: 'There is no quantum world.<br />There is only an abstract quantum mechanical description.It is wrong<br />to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is.<br />Physics concerns what we can say about nature.\\"<br />On the other hand, Einstein insists on his belief in the existence of<br />a causal, observer-independent reality. He says: \\"What we call science<br />has the sole purpose of determining what is\\". Einstein and his<br />Princeton team produce an ingenious thought-experiment called EPR that<br />casts a major shadow on the Bohr-Heisenberg view called the<br />'Copenhagen Interpretation'. However, for all practical purposes, most<br />scientists by the mid-20th century accept the Copenhagen view and get<br />on with their science. Albert Einstein toiled till his death to find a<br />Unified Field theory from which he hoped to derive the laws of Quantum<br />Mechanics. But he wasn't successful.<br />The book brings out the essence of those exhilarating times in science<br />when great minds battle year after year on the nature of Reality<br />amidst two major world wars and the looming threats of fascism and<br />communism. In spite of their battles for decades, both Bohr and<br />Einstein were such great human beings, having a great regard and<br />affection for one another. The other giants like de Broglie, Pauli,<br />Heisenberg and Schroedinger also show great respect and regard for<br />their opponents' views and keep egos and personalities out of the<br />equation.<br />Manjit Kumar's narrative brings out all these essential human<br />qualities quite vividly. He has a great ability to write. The book is<br />lucid and delightfully accessible in spite of the difficult subject<br />matter. I enjoyed reading it immensely. In many ways, it is like a<br />thriller, as you keep looking for the next thought experiment that<br />Einstein would come up with to counter Bohr only to find out how the<br />Copenhagen team overcomes each of these hurdles. I would recommend it<br />strongly to anyone interested in popular science in general and<br />Quantum Mechanics in particular.le year after year on the nature of Reality  amidst two major world wars and the looming threats of fascism and  communism.

0802130208|1.0|A misguided friend of mine gave me this to read while I was in the hospital around 30 years ago. It was new at the time, and praised highly. I couldn't stand it. The novel was boring, amateurish and unreadable, obviously written by a talentless individual. (The first chapter felt like trying to run a marathon in quicksand.) I still don't understand why it was published, except perhaps to prove that Pulitzer prize winners are usually overrated. Awful.

032147404X|4.0|I paid $14.60 of this book at Amazon, and I'm glad I bought it.  If you have more time than money, don't buy this book--you can probably find most of the suggestions on the web for free.  The thing is, you have to take the time to find them.  The great thing about this book is that all the very-useful suggestions are in the same place.  That's why I gave this review the title I did.  There are good hints for avid photographers who are just shooting for their own satisfaction (like the section on Taking Travel and City Life Shots), or for more serious photographers who might want to make some money doing this (Like the section on Shooting a Wedding).  I'm satisfied enough to consider Scott's other books, though I have not ruled out other authors.
0553801503|1.0|The first three books in the series were absolutely wonderful. This one was awful. Way too much information! Our small, compact world is blown completely open. Martin definitely did not bother to edit this one. And it shows. Oh, does it show. I thought the first three books were incredible. This one is a piece of junk. Don't read it! You'll not only be saving yourself time, you'll save yourself the potential agony of seeing a series you loved utterly ruined.
B001U6YI92|5.0|The blu-ray version of this classic spaghetti western looks and sounds great for such an old movie.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|I bought this set for my space history crazy 13 year old son, and he persuaded my husband and me to watch it with him over the course of two weeks.  It was a great time together.  This is a very well done series, and for the most part, historically accurate.  I must admit I found it a bit disconcerting in places where fact and fiction were intertwined -- for instance, on the Apollo 13 series, where they did the old veteran professional journalist being upstaged and ultimately replaced by the hotshot young tabloid-style reporter.  I wanted to know who the old guy was supposed to have been, and found out he was a fictional character.  I loved the first two episodes, but was less entranced by the third, which was the Apollo 7 episode.  Mark Harmon just didn't get Wally Schirra right.   The fourth and fifth episodes, depicting Apollos 8 and 9 (and 10 got a brief mention) were wonderful.   The episode on Apollo 11 focused on the complex character of Buzz Aldrin, and I think it could have been done better.  Apollo 12 was pure joy; and the one on Apollo 13 I liked even though it was the least focused on the mission itself.  I found myself not swept away by the Apollo 14 mission one, mostly because, again, it's hard to get Shepard right, and this one came close enough to be irritating when it didn't.  We loved the Apollo 15 episode, that focused on how hard it is to train pilots to be geologists.  I liked the Apollo 16 episode which focused on the wives of the second group of astronauts and their fates; my 13 year old son, as you can imagine, would have preferred hearing more about Duke, Young, and Mattingly on the moon.    The only episode I thought truly did not work was the last....so the series kind of fizzles to an end,  just like the Apollo program, I guess!
B002QW7AJY|4.0|All in all this is a pretty fun movie.  I watched it with my son over two nights and I liked it.  The ending was pretty interesting and my son was creeped out at 12.  I thought they needed to go into the back story a little more but all in all worth the watch.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|I bought this watch because it looks simplistic, yet robust and I hoped it would last given that it was powered by an automatic mechanism and made by a company who I thought were supposed to have a great reputation.    It holds time for about 4hours.  Then it stops.  It does not seem to matter how much I shake it to get the weight to swing and thus wind the watch.  In essence its an automatic watch which does not work.  I thought SEIKO were supposed to make great watches?  If I could I would give it zero Stars.  Maybe I just bought a lemon.  I know that can happen and based on some of the other reviews, that would appear to be the case, so if Seiko want to comment and help then I am all ears. Otherwise, complete waste of my money and no more Seiko products for this consumer.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|The best foreign films find a way of telling you something about the subject country's culture, and in a fresh way tell the viewer about a previously  unknown aspect of the subject Country's life and culture.  While \\"Departures\\" is by no means the blockbuster film that the recent Bollywood film, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" was, I assure you that if you are up to learning about Japanese Culture and their profound respect for the dead, and for life as well, this movie will move you as few ever will.  Departures tells the story of a young man whose life takes an unexpected turn as he is abruptly severed from his dream life as a concert orchestra musician when the orchestra goes bankrupt.  With the support of his wife, he returns to his home town and by chance, becomes the apprentice of a \\"nokanshi\\" or coffiner, a person who dresses the recently deceased, and helps them transition into the afterlife.  Without the tremendous skill and respect with which such a personal and profound topic, this could have been a very unpleasant film to watch.  Instead this film is laced with humor, pathos, and leaves the viewer richer and grateful for life, its value.  If you watch this film, I believe that you'll have a much greater appreciation enriching aspects of forgiveness, gratitude and humility as discovered in the human experience.  Surprising, unexpected and profoundly moving.  Highly recommended!  That this film received the Academy Award for best Foreign Film is not surprise.  It is a surprise that it didn't win \\"Best Picture\\".  It is THAT good!
1892005034|4.0|While many of the techniques presented in this slim volume are entirely worthwhile and of great value in making oneself clear and defusing potentially tense communications, I still disagree with some of the author's fundamental categorization of \\"needs.\\"  While it may be useful, or even necessary under certain circumstances, to address the desires of another person in addition to, or even perhaps prior to, their needs, I continue to maintain that there is an important distinction to be made between genuine human needs and mere desires, and that kowtowing excessively to the desires of others, while entirely likely to smooth out an otherwise difficult conversation, is of limited value in the long-term.  Reinforcing the legitimacy, to say nothing of the primacy, of such desires can go quite a way toward reifying them in the minds of their holders, and thence to create an increased sense of entitlement.  All that said, I still find the techniques described to be extremely useful, especially in such cases as \\"arguing about the toothpaste\\" when there is clearly a deeper and more important issue underlying a given conflict.  What flaws there are, in many instances, are more the flaws of novice to intermediate practitioners of NVC rather than of the author himself, as is shown in many of the included examples.
1594488843|5.0|There are some books you read and you simply absorb and move on about your business.  These books either impact you profoundly at a subconscious level, and you don't realize the impact until much much later; or, they don't impact you at all.  There are other books that seem to reframe your view right away and the more you converse, you find the language of the text seeping into your conversations and thusly reinforce what you've learned every time you employ the wisdom transfered through your readership.<br /><br />Dan Pink has written three books in a row that have had impact on my perspective.  Any regular follower of the blog knows how much I've been influenced by [[ASIN:1594481717 A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future]] or \\"[[ASIN:1594482918 The Adventures of Johnny Bunko: The Last Career Guide You'll Ever Need]].\\"  Those texts highlighted to me where I needed to go next given the headspace I was in when I read them.  If there's any big \\"a-ha\\" to me from Pink's new book, \\"[[ASIN:1594488843 Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us]],\\" it's that he's writing about where I am now. Dan Pink is ahead of the future curve, letting people know behind him what's coming up ahead.<br /><br />When I try to boil down the theme of the book to one central idea, it's that of intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivations.  He frames this early on in the book in a number of ways.  First, by talking about the failures of Arthur Anderson, Enron, Wall Street and our financial institutions, he dispels the notions that focusing on the mushy stuff doesn't affect the bottom line.  Clearly, by losing focus on things like greater purpose, ethics, the people we affect, the change we want to see in the world -- losing that kind of focus and, instead, hyper-focusing on performance results (extrinsic motivators) affects material gains, at least in the short-term, but at the expense of losing those material games and wreaking unspeakable havoc on the lives of people far beyond the scope of your perceived impact.  Pink highlights a number of changes I didn't know about that are starting to happen -- for instance, in April 2008, Vermont became the first US state to allow a new type of business called an L3C (low-profit limited liability corporation).  It operates like a for-profit business but it's primary aim is to offer significant social benefits. -- an interesting alternative to a 503c corporation.<br /><br />Second, Pink frames the praise of intrinsic motivation by highlighting, with multiple examples, that this isn't new, it's well researched and the evidence holds true in the face of how we think about rewards. He links the notion of how work can translate to play (or vice-versa) to the example of Tom Sawyer getting his friends to pay to paint his fence.  This \\"Sawyer Effect\\" was researched by behavioral scientists like Harlow (1940s), Maslow (1950s) and Deci (1960s), Lepper and Greene (1970s). There's now seven decades of research on how people are actually motivated, and while you might not have heard of these names, if you're in learning you've no doubt heard of  Abraham Maslow.  The theme of \\"the hidden costs of rewards\\" is recalled with several examples.<br /><br />To be clear, Pink doesn't admonish rewards or money or anything like that.  He's making the case, very convincingly, that there's something else, bigger than the material, that we need to focus on -- that once we've met some very basic survival needs, we're ultimately leading unsatisfying lives unless we're working for something bigger than what's immediately in front of us.  By tapping into that greater good, we unlock a lot more contribution, engagement and ultimately rewards of a virtuous cycle.  One way to identify this potential, Pink cites fairly early on, is identifying heuristics vs. algorithms.  This is critically important and timely.

1416595554|5.0|Simon Montefiore is a historian of Russia and an award-winning author of \\"Potemkin: Catherine the Great's Imperial Partner,\\" \\"Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar,\\" and \\"Young Stalin.\\"  With \\"Sashenka\\" Mr. Montefiore has applied his vast knowledge to the world of historical fiction. His expertise really enhances this novel, filled with characters that come to life on the page, along with an absorbing and moving storyline that spans the end of Russia's Tsarist regime, the Bolshevik Revolution, life under Lenin and Stalin, and, finally, to 1994, after the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />The author's ancestors escaped the Tsarist Empire, an event which sparked his interest in Russia. In Sashenka he writes about a fictional woman and her family. However, he has stated that this book was inspired by \\"many stories, letters and cases that he found in archives and in interviews over a period of ten years.\\"<br /><br />It is 1916 when the reader meets Sashenka Zeitlin, the 16 year-old daughter of a wealthy Jewish arms merchant in St. Petersburg. Her father, Samuil, is the proprietor of the Anglo-Russian Naptha-Oil Bank of Baku and has ties to the Tsarist regime. In 1915, the grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaivich declared all Jews potential German spies and had them driven out of their villages. Although a Jew, Zeitlin has the right to stay in St. Petersburg because he is a merchant of the First Guild. Just before WWI he was elevated to the rank of the Emperor's Secret Councillor.<br /><br />Sashenka's unstable mother idolizes and socializes with the notorious mystic Rasputin, called the \\"Mad Monk\\" by his detractors. And Sashenka, influenced by her uncle Mendel, has become a staunch Marxist. Even at her young age, she is a Bolshevik operator who risks her life on more than one occasion for the upcoming and inevitable Revolution. Her motto is \\"All or nothing,\\" taken from one of Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen's heroes. She firmly believes in \\"a class struggle that would progress through set stages to a workers' paradise of equality and decency.\\"<br /><br />Eventually, she is arrested for her activism and is subsequently pursued by a Tsarist officer who futily attempts to turn her into an informer. When the Romanov regime falls she becomes a secretary to Lenin.<br /><br />The 2nd and longest part of the novel takes place in Moscow, 1939. Josef Stalin rules the country with an iron fist. During the late 1930s he had launched a great purge, (also known as the \\"Great Terror\\"), a campaign to eradicate the Communist Party of people accused of sabotage, terrorism, or treachery. He extended it to the military and other sectors of Soviet society. Targets were often executed or imprisoned in Gulag labor camps. The fortunate were exiled. In the years following, millions of ethnic minorities were murdered or sent into exile.<br /><br />When this part of the narrative opens, Shashenka has become a beautiful woman, the wife of a senior Communist officer, Vanya, and the mother of two beautiful children. She is a model Soviet woman who works as the editor of the \\"Soviet Wife and Proletarian Housekeeping magazine.\\" The family enjoys the privileges of their high rank in the Party. Oddly, their lifestyle is not dissimilar to the one Sashenka lived before the Revolution. Their friends and acquaintances are the amongst the Communist Party elite, and Stalin and Beria even attend one of Sashenka's and Vanya's parties - a tense situation at best. A stray word or false rumor could cost one his/her life, which seriously detracts from the pleasantries of the family's existence, indeed the existence of all Russians.<br /><br />I don't want to include \\"spoilers,\\" but let it suffice to say that the lives of Sashenka and her family change drastically during this period.<br /><br />Sashenka's story is hidden for half a century when a young woman, a historian, is hired in 1994, to discover what happened to our protagonist and her family.<br /><br />This is a tale of family, love, politics, injustice and heartbreak. Indeed, I was moved to tears at times. With the exception of Alexandr Solzhenitsyn's novel \\"The Gulag Archipelago,\\" I have never really understood the depths of horror that unfortunates faced in the forced labor camps, spread all over the Soviet Union, especially in Siberia. And what a blood-spattered history that is.<br /><br />\\"Sashenka\\" is a gripping read. The plot is exceptional. This novel is historical fiction at its best and is certainly worthy of 5 stars!<br />Jana Perskietears at times.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Having stopped running because of lower back pain, I've really missed the activity.  At age 55 I did not want to stop.  This book has given me new insight and inspiration to start up again.  A year and a half without running after years of wonderful runs hurts the spirit.  This book is getting me running again, plus it was also a great read.
1415926697|3.0|I gave this audio CD 3 stars because the author does a great job of narrating this book, however, the story itself just goes on and on and on about her pain, her depression, her desperation without enough insights, inspiration and breakthrough's to provide this book with a better sense of balance to be enjoyable to follow.  By the time the author arrives in India I just can't listen to it anymore.  Elizabeth, if you are reading this, I suspect that you are/were suffering from the effects of a childhood where you were raised by parents (one or both)who probably had/have Borderline Personality Disorder - parents with this condition have an inability to see you and love you for who you are.  The recovery process you go through as you write about it in the book is very similiar to adult survivors of BPD parent(s). (ie. your fusing with men, willingness to deny yourself and your needs to become whoever it is they need you to be to 'earn' their love, your difficulty in establishing boundaries in your relationships with men, your harsh criticism of yourself/blaming yourself for relationships that you call 'failures' rather than seeing them as relationships that didn't fully meet your needs).

B002H3F7F6|5.0|\\"If On A Winter's Night\\" naturally follows the trajectory of Sting's own learning curve.  Sting continually reaches and thinks, liberally sharing his insights and sources, educating and entertaining as he goes.  This wonderful winter album is no different.  A collection of ancient carols, and other songs of the cold season, it requires attention and a bit of stretching from the modern listener.<br /><br />Our favorites include \\"Soul Cake,\\" a Halloween begging song retooled for Christmas and blended with strains of \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.\\"  We loved the \\"Cherry Tree Carol,\\" for it's lovely ancient feel, and my elementary-school-aged son loves \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man.\\"  The wonderful part is that every song has a story, and each leads us toward new understandings, creatively and historically.<br /><br />One song that has been released on another Sting album is his composition \\"The Hounds of Winter,\\" from Mercury Falling.  The lyrics were always beautiful, but this reworking evokes the lonely feeling of lost love struggling though the winter wind to much better effect.<br /><br />I hesitate to write anything negative, because I've found that over the last few months, I understand better after more listening, and ones I disliked initially have become favorites (especially \\"Cold Song\\" from the lost opera, King Arthur.)  One has to keep in mind that it's a cross-cultural experience, even though the culture is the ancient British Isles.  This music and these stories make the past come alive, mystical experiences and all, and you may find, as I have, that the ancient past is really not that far away from our modern hearts and minds.

0061537969|5.0|Where to start? Well lets explain me, I'm a 29 male, love dogs and interested in all sort of racing.  These are probably the reasons why the book caught my eye.  I would classify myself as a causal reader.  I start reading about 10-20 books a yr and finish somewhere between 5-10.  I typically takes about a month to finish a book.........not this one.      It took me a week to read the 1st 100pgs, but the last 200 or so I finished in 2 days.  I'm pretty sure that's a record for me.  This book triggered emotions in me that I never thought a book could do.  I highly recommend anyone to read this one, it's amazing!      The book is about life overall.  It is told through the eyes for an adorable character named Enzo.  The book is well written, easy to read, and the only book to every make me excited to finish.  A must read for everyone!

B001GSV3EC|5.0|I have been a fan of Jeff's since as long as I can remember.  I was gigging as an electric guitarist for many years, and as time went on, the number of top electric guitarists I really enjoyed began to dwindle, until finally Beck was left standing almost alone at the pinnacle.  He keeps reinventing himself, and that quality is rare, especially since many find it necessary to keep doing their safe expected material in order to keep the fans that allow them to make a living.  I suppose that being a custom car builder has freed him from some of those pressures.        He manages to cover the entire spectrum of expression, from a quietly poignant melody all the way to a thunderous roar.  After having heard his recordings for many years, I finally was lucky enough to catch him live here in the states one night.  I consider it to be one of the greatest concerts of my entire life, and I've heard some good ones.  He was on fire all night.    Much later, I remember seeing his Crossroads show performance on TV.  It was very good, no surprise, but with the enormous crowd, he actually seemed a tiny bit nervous.  And I remember seeing what seemed to be a very drunk Bill Murray introducing him to the audience, which was quite amusing.  I was glad to have seen Jeff in a more relaxed setting.    I have many recordings of him, and have followed his every style change.  It would be easy to become jaded.  But as I listened to this recording, even though the material was all familiar, I was somehow re-stunned, and it brought back memories of that special show.  After awhile, the image that came to mind was of him walking along carrying a huge bag of diamonds, just tossing handfuls of them to anyone that he saw.  Glittering diamonds of creativity and sound.

I don't want to say anything about the story other than it hit home for me. You just need to read it, or get it for the young-adult in your life.<br />Uses some profane language, but it is really, in good taste. This fact should not be a deterrent, if it is this book isn't for you. The story is not about a sugar coated fairy world.

And I especially like the way the letters have been read out on the cd version - you truly feel like you're actually listening to Juliet and Sydney and all the rest of them. There are a ton of letters, and it's been nice to play a few of them over again to catch anything I missed the first time. Highly recommended.
B00008YJHC|4.0|Popular music must have really changed in twenty years, because I've never found the Pixies to be as inaccessible as people seem to say they were. I know they were recording just before grunge and alternative rock in general really took off, but an album like Bossanova hardly seems out of the mainstream now to me. I mean, it's not exactly what you'd call standard rock, but I could easily see songs like \\"Velouria\\" or \\"Is She Weird\\" playing on the radio. The album definitely has less of a unique reputation than their earlier work, and while I don't like it as much as Doolittle there's definitely a lot to find. The funny thing is, while it may be more mainstream, it took me longer to get into. I like most of the songs now, but at first it only really seemed to get good somewhere in the second half.    The first two songs, one of which is a cover, feature very little vocals and mostly serve as an extended introduction to the band's general sound. Of the fourteen songs, some are pretty darn short, some are a bit longer, some more melodic and others a bit off-beat, most of them focusing on otherworldly themes and being driven by a nice mix of Black Francis' eccentric singing, Joey Santiago's guitar, and Kim Deal's bass and backing vocals. Really, the second track's title of \\"Rock Music\\" is pretty fitting. My favorite song is probably \\"The Happening\\", with a unique spacey chorus consisting of a single sound changing in pitch, and which overlays with a half-sung monologue in the last section, one of the band's best moments. To be honest I was more interested in getting Surfer Rosa but chose this instead so I'd finally have an album from the year 1990 since I'm kind of weird, but it ended up working out pretty well.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|Perhaps it is because I like stories about people who are obsessed.  Then there's the fact that the person who is obsessed is one of my favorite younger actors, Jake Gyllenhall. He plays a cartoonist with a San Francisco newspaper who wants to find the serial killer, the Zodiac.  Everyone else involved in it gives up as the Zodiac has a way of disappearing. Although the Zodiac's killings are especially gruesome, the movie is really not about the murders as it is about the obsession to uncover him.  I think there is something especially galling about a serial murderer who just dies a regular death and is never brought to justice.  The suspect the cartoonist focuses upon goes exactly down that road.  Yet it is not at all certain that he was the Zodiac.  All that's known is that he has been gone for a long, long time and is probably dead since his murders started forty years ago.  The supporting cast is stellar too, Mark Ruffalo as the cop, Robert Downey Jr. as a reporter and host of others.  It's in one and the same moment an absolutely chilling case yet also a world class frustrating case.  Just about everyone who was professionally involved in this case became a victim to it as well.  It just tore every person apart as it unravelled them instead of vice versa.  There are two killings which you won't be able to forget.  A couple at a lover's lane and another couple by themselves at a remote lake.

B001OQCV6K|3.0|Guy Ritchie has been blessed on having some top talent willing to work with him.  Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law certainly come through for him as much as any actors could. However, Ritchie seems intent on making Holmes into one of these ultra profitable super heroes who can be milked for movie after movie.  Downey is so good that he comes very close to pulling this off but the script and director work at cross purposes with him. Where this really goes amiss is that Ritchie uses an over the top plot with this black magic practitioner villain who is just too much, sort of a Bela Lugosi on steroids.  Downey's character development moments are a lot better than anything going on in that plot contrivance. He is very good with the Irene Adler character.  He is also  humorous, as when Watson's girlfriend throws wine in his face or Irene drugs him and leaves him manacled to a hotel bed.  If we could combine the scripts which were used in the Jeremy Bret versions of Holmes with Downey Jr., we really might have something.  Downey is such a top talent that I don't think he should waste himself working with Ritchie.  He's got just about every first rate director lined up to use him and he ought to go with one of them.  I thought Rachel McAdams was quite good too.  Ritchie is not known for being good at working with women, in fact just the opposite.  McAdams somehow surmounts this and comes through as Irene.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B002EA4IO8|5.0|To the Opposition:  Some opposition has said that they feel this book was written by a young adult rather than just for young adults. The novel is simply written, but that is what makes it so intriguing and meaningful. Only someone truly skilled can write so simply and clear.   Summary:  It is written from the point of view of Bruno, a naïve nine-year-old, who is the son of a very prominent and important Nazi commander. Bruno's father receives a very important new job and the whole family has to move to a place called \\"Out-With\\". There are no other houses or families there, but Bruno discovers a fence with `hundreds or even thousands' of people in striped pajamas on the other side. Through his exploration, Bruno befriends a boy and they visit, each on their side of the fence, every day. Bruno, through all of his experiences, never quite figures out what is going on around him, but maintains a loving and strong heart to what he knows, and thinks he knows, is true.   Review:  I found this book very enjoyable to read through the eyes of an innocent child. It gave it a new perspective that you could explore with a naïve beginning to the horrors of the holocaust. It was a little hard for me at first to adjust to the simplicity of it, but I was able to realize it only added to the perspective and theme of the book. I certainly shed a few tears at the end.
B001HN69B8|4.0|I found this a wonderful collection of vignettes flying in close formation, rather than a single coherent whole. Christopher Plummer's boozy Parnassus provided a strong, unifying presence, although I'd be hard-pressed to call it leadership. Lily Cole, with her wonderfully distinctive facial features, pulled her weight in the movie and more - including that scene where her Valentina character reprised a scene from Gilliam's earlier [[ASIN:0767809335 Munchausen]], a youthful Uma Thurman as Venus on the half-shell. Tom Waits, of course, contributed an amazing personality (along with his acid-washed voice) to the role of Mr. Nick in this deal-with-the-devil plot.<br /><br />Plot? Did I say plot? Well, I guess there might have been something like one in there somewhere. Mostly, I found this a thoughtful montage of imagery, with overtones of everything from [[ASIN:B000BB1MI2 Willy Wonka's]] shoe store, to Gilliam's [[ASIN:B0009XRZ92 Monty Python]] animations, to Mordor's spreading darkness from [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings]]. In the midst of all that gilliamic weirdness, the teenaged Valentina maintains a child's quiet conviction that her home is as normal as any. Still, like the Helena character of [[ASIN:B000BT97AO Mirrormask]], Valentina yearns to run away from the circus and join the everyday world.<br /><br />Heath Ledger's unfortunate death partway through filming forced Gilliam to think fast - and he did. It actually made a strange sort of sense that Ledger's character suddenly took on multiple different faces at different moments, the way Gilliam played it out. In the end, that's what I came away with: a renewed appreciation for Gilliam's visual creativity (even if some looked a little recycled). If that's enough for you, too, you'll find plenty to like in this star-studded sleeper.<br /><br />- wiredweird

B002ZJGN96|1.0|I admit that there are video game and movie soundtracks that I like solely because they take me back to the experience I had in the theater or comfort of my living room. So perhaps take this review with a grain of salt, for I have not seen Avatar yet.     The soundtrack is trite. I don't know how else to say this, but if you look at the task Mr. Horner was given as \\"create music that goes nicely with a jungle setting,\\" then his response is almost entirely too fitting. Similar to the way the ridiculously lame font for the movie's title screams \\"jungle/tribal font\\" the soundtrack sounds like somebody took one pass at \\"jungle/tribal music,\\" and gave it the thumb's up. The warbling flute, the quick accentual chant, the tribal drums. I know that this is poorly executed because the result is what I would have done on my first pass, been frankly embarrassed by, and then promptly thrown out.     I'm sure the movie is spectacular and I look forward to seeing it. But this soundtrack is doing nothing for the film.
0670021652|5.0|I loved Eat, Pray, Love. So there was no question I had to read its sequel. I have to say, I loved COMMITTED so much that I read it TWICE. I am actually considering going back and reading it a third time with a highlighter. As someone who also got married before the age of 25 and also divorced by 30 and ALSO (I am not making this up) swore off the institution of marriage only to fall in love with and marry an older man from southern Brazil, Elizabeth Gilbert's \\"Committed\\" has answered so many of my questions and lingering anxieties about my own experience. As an artist, I also really appreciate and understand her need to write a book for 27 people as opposed to writing a best-selling book for millions of fans. How does one intentionally do the latter anyway? I don't know how well this book will sell or how popular it will be. But I respect the fact that Liz Gilbert wrote this book for herself and the need to understand her own process, and given that 50% of all marriages in America end in divorce, I suspect I am not the only one who will find comfort and understanding within its pages.

B000002U8G|4.0|Currently, I have this album, \\"The Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"I wish you were here,\\" \\"The Wall,\\" and \\"The Final Cut.\\"  Wow, I almost forgot,\\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\\"  I've really enjoyed all these albums, especially \\"The Wall.\\"  I really like the deepness of that album.  This album is musically great, but lacks in the lyrically brilliance the future albums have.      Lets move on to songs, \\"One of These Days\\" is really epic, and guitar work is gradual, than you start hear it more clearly later in the song 4/5.  The beginning of, \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" really sounds like \\"The Dark Side of the Moon 4/5.\\"  \\"Fearless,\\" is brilliant lyrically, and musically 5/5.  \\"San Tropez,\\" has a good beat, and lyrics really complament the piano playing and a drum, and the light guitar work 5/5.          I think twinty three minutes for a song is a over-kill.  The song is sort of awesome, all the guiter riffs and a drumming and all of that, but it gets really repetitious and a bit taciturn and boring.  The beginning of the \\"Echoes\\" is wonderful, it sounds like a submarine, but the middle parts can get a little boring.  The song is very gradual, that's what kills listeners like me, I enjoy slow tempo pieces and songs, but this song stays frozen for a while and doesn't change sound of a long time.  I would have to say the effects as cool and interesting and very original, but all originality isn't great.  The song is a 3/5.      Overall 4/5 stars.  My all time favorite is, \\"San Tropez.\\"    I think it's a must get if you enjoyed Pink's debute album or Dark Side.

B002DKF47O|4.0|Let me start by saying that Behemoth is one of my favorite death metal bands. They never put technicality over composition and are almost never self-indulgent, at least musically. That said, I must admit that I was disappointing with this release. While the musicianship, production, and ideas are all there, this album lacks the power that Behemoth displayed on Demigod. Considering Nergel said they weren't satisfied with the recording process of The Apostasy, I was expecting more from Evangelion as they were far more pleased with the recording process of this album. To me, it sounds like Behemoth has fallen into the same trap as many other great metal acts: they write an extraordinary album and then ride the hype-train without pushing the creative process in a new direction. While there is almost no noticeable artistic difference between Evangelion and The Apostasy, this record is recognizably more technical then their masterpiece, Demigod. Actually, there is nothing new about this album other than the underwhelming cover art.    Be that as it may, this is still Behemoth, and Behemoth hasn't released a bad album in over a decade. But when a band's live set is comprised of a mostly songs from The Apostasy and Demigod, you have to wonder about their confidence in the new album's material. In short, Evangelion is good, but Behemoth can do and has already done much better.
B00000GV55|3.0|I suppose it's better than the early 90s remix, but this 1999 CD has its own problems.  The whole disc sounds like it was mastered from vinyl, and side B is very noisy.  Comparing my Virgin LP with this disc, I found that the channels on side B were reversed.  And the coda on \\"Nirvana for Mice\\" ISN'T the original mix.  Will this record ever be released properly?  Caveat emptor.

B001UV4XX8|2.0|Based on an excellent short story, this one gets the Raspberry Award for worst adaptation.

That being said, I will say this season starts out a little slower than previous seasons.  Oh, it'll still hold your interest, that's a given, especially with its building up of storyline from episode to episode. Overall though I felt seasons 2 and 3 were stronger.  I like this show, but it's not perfect - and perhaps this could be said of all the seasons. In terms of excitement and entertainment value it's as 5 star as a Big Mac is full of cholesterol.   It's only weakness is in the occasional little illogical (but convenient) plot devices that crop up out of nowhere.  Yes, I'm saying that what keeps me from taking this show completely seriously is that there are scenarios that are not just a bit far-fetched, but sometimes completely defy the laws of logic - see if you can spot them.  I'd name 3 or 4 examples right off the top of my head but who needs spoilers?  It doesn't matter - that's just the nature of the show, like cholesterol is part of a Big Mac.  You enjoy it and will order it again.  If not the Big Mac, then the fries.  Not a fair analogy I realize, considering I don't care much for Big Macs while I am already looking forward to the next season of Dexter.  I will say that in the tradition of 'all's well that ends well', this season goes out with a bang that will leave you eager to see how the writers clean up the mess they have made.
0061914177|5.0|If you are considering a change in life in order to go after your passion, you should read this book.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|Absolutely nothing like the original cartoon. The director did nothing to create the same feeling of mystery, excitement, or patriotism I had as a kid waking up at 6am to watch it on TV. Then playing with my Joe's for hours. The most disappointing movie I have ever seen. Every character is bland and the story beyond weak. I hope someone remakes this movie because they got it all wrong! Truly sad, I can't believe I gave them my $$$$ and 2 hours of my time.
0316069906|2.0|It was Foer's profound handling of 9/11 and the holocaust that inevitably drew me to his latest book \\"Eating Animals.\\"  I had to see what he would say.   I wanted to see another display of brilliance.  Unfortunately, it didn't deliver.    Ultimately, the author is trying to make a moral point.  He seeks to educate his audience about the horrors and indecencies of animal factories and in turn persuade them to consider making lifestyle changes befitting the issues he's outlined and argued.  While the book isn't trying to make a direct case for vegetarianism, it nevertheless leaves the reader wondering if it isn't.  That's my impression, anyway.      What frustrated me most... no, let me rephrase that... the three things that most frustrated me were (1) his failing to establish an ethical foundation from which to launch his \\"oughts,\\" or \\"ought not's,\\" (2) the repetitive nature of the book, and (3) continually appealing to our emotions, shall I say manipulative?, to make his point.    With respect to repetition, I felt like he said the same thing over and over again, leaving me, by the end, not caring if some poor turkey wasn't adequately cared for.  The message was, simply put, overdone.  If you are part of the choir, such repetition may prove exciting, but if not, then prepare to be annoyed.  This is especially the case if you don't buy into his underlying presuppositions.  For me, while I do think animals should be handled humanely, they are, in the final analysis, not human and are therefore available for our consumption.  Period.  This conviction flows out of my Judeo-Christian worldview.  Just consider what the apostle Paul says in Romans 14:1-3, for example.  Eating animals is perfectly fine.  But where do his \\"oughts\\" flow out of?  I'm not sure.  Is it Derrida's relativism?  Is it materialistic evolution?  Why care about anything if nothing has ultimate meaning?  Why not tear apart chickens however one might so please?  Tooth and claw, right?    Along a different line, the gravity (or solemnity) which he attributes to this particular issue, as is especially evident in his choice of words and the manner in which he tells stories, simply isn't commensurate with the subject matter.  This is especially true when the issue is viewed in light of the vast amount of human suffering going on around the world.  In other words, can a person so disproportionately express their passions as to trivialize other more weighty matters by inadvertently equating them?  I think so.  And in this respect, it's hard not to feel a measure of agitation while reading this book... even though he raises some valid concerns about animal mistreatment.      Therefore, I give the book two stars.

McCann's descriptions of the preparation for the event, the event itself, and Petit's feelings in the aftermath... are also art, using words instead of physical agility.   This is one of those rare books with great characters, a mesmerizing story, BUT mostly gorgeous writing.
B002SF9YUM|4.0|to begin:  this is NOT a 'gay' film; if that is your expectation, you'll be disappointed.    this is a film about unrequited love:  the love for a country and for a man.  it is a film about federico garcia lorca:  who loved spain and salvador dali; neither the country nor the man was stable enough nor secure enough to accept lorca's love; both were at war with themselves; both rebuffed lorca; both abandoned lorca. the man killed a part of lorca's soul; the country killed his body. the man was a surreal amalgam of self-agrandizement and self-loathing who never came to terms with lorca and who became a clown in the eyes of the art world; the country was schizophrenic, but came to espouse lorca's ideals of freedom and acceptance -- now, spain is one of the more open and free societies in the world.    this film is exquisitely beautiful; as is javier beltran in his characterization of lorca:  this film is his!
B000Y7U98C|4.0|Sure, the third act was a bit of a disappointment, why add a physical villian? Unecessary. HOwever, the first two thirds had the potential to be one of the best peice of movie scifi out since orignal Star Trek aired on TV.    NOW IMPORTANT NOTE!! The incredible soundtrack by John Murphy can only be bought in digital form on Itunes of all places. And its abridged, becuase there are problems with music rights. Compose John Murphy (who you can become a fan of on facebook) will actually respond to your wall posts. Like talking to a rockstar.

B0013FXWU6|2.0|PLOT SPOILER ALERT!  Greed = insanity.  The greedier you are the crazier you are.  There, that's the entire plot.  It's a story that could have been told more effectively in an 8-minute skit.  The other two-and-a-half hours are pure boredom -- right up there with most Kevin Costner films.  The movie just drones on and on and on and on ... and never makes a point you hadn't already gotten in the first few minutes -- Daniel Plainview is crazed with greed.  About every 20 minutes you'll find yourself shouting at your TV, \\"Okay, I get it.  He's nuts!  Tell me something new!\\"  But it never comes.<br /><br />I bought the movie as a Christmas gift for one of my kids, but got stuck with it when he received a duplicate.  He usually has good taste in movies, so I decided to keep it for myself.  Just another in a lifetime of bad decisions!<br /><br />So why did I give it 2 stars?  Well, it does have good acting, an interesting musical score, and impressive cinematography.  It has some of the best production values of any boring movie I've ever watched.  So, if enjoy watching granite erode, you'll probably like this film.  Otherwise, it's a snooze-fest only a critic could like.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|I kept waiting for something to pull it together to make sense, but even with the ending I realized that they did not have an ending for a long pointless boring story. The Actor, Daniel Day-lewis was fantastic, and the photography. But, without a story what is it?
B000OVLBF8|4.0|I know; GHOST RIDER is based on a Marvel comic book series, for cryin' out loud.  I realize the story about Johnny Blaze collecting souls has a metaphysical premise to begin with, but still can't help but giggle when the Ghost Rider manifestation appears:  skull aflame, spikes on the shoulders of the leather jacket, chains afire, and a bike that goes anywhere it wants and does anything it wants.  Yep, the comic artist who spawned an apparition like this must have been sipping some pretty stout absinthe.  How else can you think up stuff like this?<br /><br />But enough with the silliness of this particular superhuman character who dares to defy Mephistopheles; GHOST RIDER (the movie) is just plain fun to watch, for a myriad of reasons.  Granted, Nicolas Cage looks more like a Johnny Blaze just joining AARP, but he still brings his own quirky humor to what could have been way too dark a role.  Buxom, voluptuous beauties like Eva Mendes make one glad to be alive; I could watch her bake cookies and still need heart medication.  Sam Elliott is one of my all-time fave actors, sporting a mumbling voice so low you swear you can feel the floor vibrate.  (\\"It's what's for dinner.\\")  And Peter Fonda is a wickedly evil Mephistopheles in such a quiet, disturbing way.  Combine all of the above with eye-popping CGI/special effects, plug in an over-the-top ending that dares to suggest a sequel (don't they all?), and GHOST RIDER may be the most fun you'll ever have with total nonsense.  Nic, your scalp's on fire.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B0010ZR160|3.0|Talk about a film that leaves me conflicted, `Gone Baby Gone' delivered in unexpected ways; good and bad.  For me, this is not a film I'd ever watch again, for it isn't quite good enough to warrant it, but it is a film that is worth seeing at least once.<br /><br />I'll give it that.<br /><br />I'll get the plot out of the way first, that way I'm freed up to ramble a bit.  A little girl is kidnapped in South Boston, and the loving aunt hires a private-eye named Patrick to augment the police investigation in hopes that he'll find the little girl quicker.  Patrick, or more precisely his girlfriend/partner Angie, is hesitant, especially after meeting the young girls horrific mother Helene, but a single picture of a smiling little angel is enough to persuade both to take the case.  Patrick has street connections that aid him in uncovering some details the cop's lack, and so together they begin to unravel Helene's past and what could have led to the kidnapping of her daughter.<br /><br />But nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />I'll start with the good.  The film is extremely affecting.  My wife even muttered, as the final frames rolled on, that this film made her heart hurt.  There were many moments where I muttered, aloud, \\"oh no, please not that\\", and I know that seems odd to say that is a GOOD thing, but I commend a film that can reach me that deeply.  This film did that.  I also want to commend Affleck's direction, for he understands how to build tension.  Even though, for me, the film winds up being overly worked, it is not his fault but the scripts fault (which he actually helped pen, so I guess it is his fault).  His direction (and the films editing especially) is outstanding though.  As far as actual performances go, there are three that stand out for me.  No, not Amy Ryan, Casey Affleck, Ed Harris or Morgan Freeman.  For me, Amy Madigan, Titus Welliver and Michelle Monaghan steal this film.  Madigan has a brittle and convincing attachment to this situation, so much so that she breaks your heart in her few small scenes.  Titus is fantastic as the conflicted and tortured Lionel.  His final scenes especially are stunning.  For me, the biggest surprise came from Monaghan.  Her character's transformation is so believable and touching.  You completely understand that maternal side to her character and the fact that a child really, truly affects a woman in ways indescribable.  Her hospital scene alone was just gut wrenching in its subtle power.<br /><br />She was leagues better than the gimmicky Amy Ryan.<br /><br />Casey Affleck was a disappointment for me.  I remember being STUNNED at how powerful his performance was in `...Jesse James...' that same year, and yet here he was stale and kind of silly.  It's funny because I kind of liked the way the script made him fearless, but he comes off rather corny when he's talking smack.  Maybe it's his fragile frame, but he was just unconvincing to me.  I'm not a fan of Ed Harris, but I enjoyed him here, even if he wasn't a standout.<br /><br />The less said about Amy Ryan the better.<br /><br />For me though, the films biggest drawback is the script.  I'm all for plot twists, and at times I even enjoy a twist on a twist on a twist (or was it a switch on and switch on a switch?) but the way that this films `revelations' are played out is rather tedious and makes the film feel overly long.  I was waiting for it to just get to the point and END.  I felt that some of the side-plots were unnecessary (the child abuser sequence, while affecting, was just not needed).  I think that some of the character developments were obvious (Remy seems shady from the beginning, Cheese is so truthful that believing he lied is hard to do) and so it made it hard to allow yourself to be duped enough to enjoy the `twists'.<br /><br />I think that the ending is appropriate, and I really liked the fact that it was heartbreaking yet in a subtle, more naturalistic way.<br /><br />In the end, the film is good but farfrom great.  I'd recommend you see it once, but just know that this is not a film that will make you feel good.  It is devastating from start to finish and really tests your tear ducts.  I only wish that the script had been heavily edited, and that a more accomplished actor were cast in the lead.  Yes, Amy Ryan was a gimmick, but she's forgivable (although her critic award sweep and Oscar nomination is not).  Affleck (Casey, not Ben) is not forgiven for being unconvincing.film that will make you feel good.  It is devastating from start to finish and really tests your tear ducts.

B002BSHWUU|2.0|The remastering is good but nothing to write home about. A \\"standard\\" effort was made, but the engineers did not go out of their way in any shape or form. Whilst the result is good - it was overhyped - the vinyl sounds better with crisper highs. Forget stereo - those early tracks are 2 track, typically with the vocals on one channel and music on the other - I thought for the price, they would have gone the extra mile and made a true (or as close to true) stereo recording as possible - they have the technolgy to do so. This is a real pity.    Wish the video material wasn't given to us in Quicktime format as I am not a fan of the Quicktime player that will eventually not only try and take over my computer, but I am resigned to giving up my first born to that crappy app in the process.    Nonetheless, was good to listen to them again on CD, but, for a better quality recording, stick with the original Beatles vinyl box set.    No hat's off to Apple on this one - sorry.

B0019M2ITY|4.0|This is my first Swatch watch, and I like it a lot!  The design is very pretty.  The face of the watch looks beautiful, with the numbers 12, 3, 6, and 9 named, and with the other hours as little blue and pink gems.  The band consisting of smaller links and links that look like a leaf with gems, and pretty circles (see picture above).  I was worried about the links falling off because they are a little thin, but I've had this watch for a few months now, and no problems there.  Just make sure that if you do get wrist adjustments done at a Swatch store (or another watch store), that they secure the little rods holding the links, otherwise the links will fall apart.    My only complaints are that the face is susceptible to scratches if you aren't careful (it's plastic), and the ticking of the watch can be a bit loud in a silent room.    Other than those minor complaints, this is a good women's watch.  I've gotten compliments about my watch from a lot of my girl friends!
B00003CX8Y|1.0|I received what turned out to be a pirated copy of this film from DISCOUNTDAWGS.  I discovered this when the DVD wouldn't play and I inspected everything more carefully.

B00009AQMJ|5.0|I read in the LA Times earlier in the week that Earl Wild has died. It mentioned that many consider his performances of the Rachmaninov concertos to be the best ever recorded. Count me in. I bought them on cassette, and loved them. I bought this set, remastered on CD, when it became available. It appears the recordings are now available as MP3s, as well. What a deal for these five, great works!<br /><br />Rachmaninov's own recordings are well worth hearing, but don't offer modern sound quality. Wild's, while dating from the 1960s, have been remastered to sound great, and his performances are terrific, virtuosic with a clear, clean sound.<br /><br />We have lost a great pianist and, more rarely, a great American pianist.
B002X9W50E|4.0|First of all,  the album is a bargain: 33 songs on the double CD,  none of which are really filler,  and the selection bridges Bowie's career from around 1970 until the 2003 \\"Reality\\" album.  Indeed,  if I were suggesting a Bowie primer to a new listener,  I think I'd start here.  This is a nice,  tight,  varied selection,  and the sound quality is excellent.<br /><br />Second of all,  it's not REALLY a live greatest hits--there's some stuff on here that wasn't that popular when released as a studio version,  but the versions here make you wonder why they weren't.  The selections from the \\"Reality\\" album,  especially,  sound incredible,  and \\"Bring Me the Disco King\\" is one of those songs I thought I'd never hear again in a different form,  but it works--it's actually quite nice.  The \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" version here almost sounds like a run-through for the song to be included on \\"Aladdin Sane\\",  and \\"Hallo Spaceboy\\" is rescued from oblivion by a version that sounds almost like Sonic Youth.  These are not complaints.<br /><br />Third,  the band,  Bowie's delivery,  and even his between-song banter make this one of the better live albums I've listened to in years.  You can hear individual audience members reacting (and singing) in certain sections,  but there's really no ambient audience roar to drown out anything.  In fact,  the versions of \\"Rebel Rebel\\", \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\", and \\"All the Young Dudes\\" are almost anthemic here,  and the audience is as much a part of the recording as the people on stage.  In several places,  Bowie solicits audience participation to help him out: he didn't really need the help,  but I think the result is quite nice.  Maybe the album represents what the audience experienced,  and maybe not: there's a credit for \\"Pro Tools and 5.1\\" in the booklet.  Then again,  I wasn't there,  so I'm happy with what I can get.<br /><br />One thing I think is underappreciated on many of Bowie's later albums (especially the live ones) is the fantastic band behind him.  The sound and musicianship here is very good--no prima donna leads,  no deviation from the program,  but everyone hits the song just right.  Band members credited are Gerry Leonard (\\"band leader\\",  guitar,  vocals), Sterling Campbell (drums,  vocals),  Earl Slick (guitar,  and quite nice as usual),  Gail Ann Dorsey on bass,  and Catherine Russell and Mike Garson on keyboards and other.  Excellent ensemble,  but I have to say,  I'd buy a record of \\"Chopsticks\\" recorded by Slick and Dorsey.<br /><br />I dock it one star for the versions of \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Ziggy\\".  They aren't bad,  by any means,  but some things just shouldn't be done again when they're perfect the first time.

0812548094|2.0|Personally, I prefer an interesting story to rivetingly revolting descriptions of perverted gore. I really enjoyed Wizard's First Rule and was looking forward to reading this one but I couldn't even finish it (which admittedly limits my ability to review the plot, so I won't).     Using nothing but shocking violence to keep a reader's interest is immature and insulting to the reader's intelligence. Everything in the book that is not disgusting imagery is boring dialogue and preposterous motivations. I got tired of the constant feeling of revulsion pretty quickly. I'm really not a prude, I don't have a problem with sex or violence in literature when it contributes to the expression of art. This book is not art, it's porn for psychopaths.    SPOILER: I put this book down on the page where a woman finds herself holding her warm, wet intestines because she has been cut in half by another woman who just finished screwing a demon with a dick made of metal spikes or something such that her vagina has become a bloody, mangled mess that is sliding down her thighs. I just don't need that image in my head.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Because Susan Boyle was discovered and got succes through a talent show i was very sceptic    But finally i gave it a chance and listened to some songs of her on youtube. Her interpretations of songs like Wild Horses really gave me goose bums and tears in my eyes. Her voice is so beautiful. I think that this album is one that you will never grow tired of. You will listen to it for a while, and perhaps put it away for some time, but sooner or later you will listen to it again.
0545123267|5.0|I really don't understand why there are so many negative reviews on this book. Mostly all of them that I read were based on personal preference. I am a huge Twilight fan, but I read them before all the hype. I am slightly annoyed at how popular it has become because I feel the more popular something is, it seems more and more haters come out. Shiver was a great read! The style flowed and it was an easy read. You get both Sam and Grace's perspective which I thought was GREAT! I'm going to keep this short and suggest you stop reading all these reviews, and go out and read the book yourself.

B002T45VX6|4.0|Okay  i am guilty of not really listening to her other albums. I never knew really what to do with Shakira to be honest. She  initially  drew my attenttion with  \\"underneath your clothes\\". I think that was her  first  huge US hit. I wasn't really crazy about the song ,but i heard it all the time when it was big. Then I  would hear of her off and on throughout the years.    She had antoher  huge hit with  \\"hips  don't lie\\". To me  she always strikes me as an artist that has that big hit every now and then. Well finally  her album she wolf hit.     To tell the truth  the single was okay to me. I wasn't crazy about it. But I did  start reading  some reviews and people were all talking about the other songs on the album.  Then I heard \\"give it up to me\\"  and I really liked it.Now she has my  attention. So i got the album and I really liked most of the songs.    I wasn't sure if I could  enjoy a  whole  album of her but it workd out. My favorite song right  off the bat  was  Did It Again. It  just grabbed my attention and I loved dancing around to it. It's upbeat and  really doesn't take anything too seriously. I love the line  in the bridge about  seeming how she is losing the direction of her life and knows that it's just a phase. Could this be in reference to  the whole album? I wouldn't be surprised. Some artist like to  say things in a round about manner  without coming right out and saying it. I love the  song.      Men in the this Town has to be one of the best songs on the album. I liked the production on it. I initially was kind of upset that  after the bridge the chorus wasn't repeated a couple of times since I did enjoy it very much. But i grew to love it. I thought she was saying \\"Damon not meant for me\\". and  I came to find out that  she was indeed saying that.      Gypsy was a fun number and sounds different from the others. I think it's nice to have this addition to change up the pace. I enjoyed long time, good stuff,and why wait.    I found myself  getting into the spanish versions of the songs as well. Very fun album all around.  I only wished there were more fun songs but maybe at that point it would become diluted? So I think it's a refreshing album and i hope to see more from her in the future. I am a fan now.

B002TZS5GU|5.0|Though clearly the victim of distribution company turmoil, the impressively despairing \\"Carriers\\" would've been commercial poison even if properly released. Some reviewers evidently believed this was a zombie movie, and, had it been widely released, the promotion would surely have sold \\"Carriers\\" as such despite the absence of any zombies. That crucial absence aside, \\"Carriers\\" is rooted in the tradition, but from a more thematic perspective. Though there's no danger from the living dead, the quartet of travelers in \\"Carriers\\" live in a world after civilization, where paranoia rules and even the slightest contact with the infected can bring death. Unsurprisingly, this makes \\"Carriers\\" much less action-oriented than a zombie flick and heavier on the existential despair. As much as I like zombie movies, I've always felt the genre moved too far from the grim atmosphere of \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\" and \\"Carriers\\" gives the viewer more than enough of that even as it jettisons the subgenre's core.<br /><br />Co-directors/writers Alex and David Pastor wisely avoid any background and immediately throw the viewer into a near-future world of despair. We open on the road in America's southwest following a pair of brothers. We have the older, harsher Brian (Chris Pine) and more sympathetic and sensitive Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci). With them are two females, Brian's girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo) and the rather faceless Kate (Emily Van Camp), who is evidently a recent arrival to the group. A nameless plague has wiped out society, and the group travels in a moving quarantine, sterile masks on, tubs of bleach available to wash away the pestilence. Brian has devised a series of rules to survive the apocalypse, with one central rule: \\"The infected are already dead.\\" And since it's nearly impossible to say definitively that someone is not infected, this proves to be a substantial strain on interaction with those outside the group. Merely surviving is something of a chore, but the four also have a goal: to return to an abandoned, coastal hotel the brothers frequented as children and wait out the end of the world.<br /><br />The film's narrative is fairly thin and episodic, and \\"Carriers\\" is primarily a mood piece. As such the film is consistently low-key, with sharp but never flashy cinematography and a generally moody, understated score. Pics like \\"28 Days Later\\" (the most obvious recent influence) prefer to display the vast emptiness of the dead cities, but \\"Carriers\\" remains mostly in the open, emphasizing with endless, lifeless expanse ahead and behind. The wasted cities mean nothing to them because they have fled humanity, have escaped from civilization altogether. Nevertheless, a few other refugees remain, and here is where the conflict begins. As is often the case in such films, the conflicts are often moral: early on the quartet meet Frank (Christoper Meloni) and his obviously infected daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka). First they leave the pair alone in the middle of the road but, after their car fails them (with a little help from the enraged Frank), the quartet return, taking Frank's SUV and stuffing him and the sick little girl in back, sequestered behind a thick plastic sheet, promising to take her to receive an experimental treatment. This is actually the most accommodating encounter depicted in the film, and the struggle for gasoline and safety often turns suddenly violent.<br /><br />As is common to zombie and post apocalyptic films, the question as to whether human decency can survive under such circumstances is key to the film. The answer is, as it almost always is in such films, \\"no,\\" but \\"Carriers\\" treats this question in a bleaker and more intelligent way than most. While too many films glibly suggest that the end of law turns men into fascists, \\"Carriers\\" acknowledges a darker truth: under the worst circumstances, the choice between callousness and decency is the choice between life and death. Callousness, rather than hatredor violence, is the defining characteristic of the survivor: they are inclined not so much to brutalize the others, but instead to leave them behind, to simply drive away while the other stands alone on the empty highway with nothing but desert for miles in every direction. (W/o giving too much away, one particular abandonment scene has got to be one of the worst gut-punch scenes I've come across in recent memory.)<br /><br />In spite of the emphasis on mood, \\"Carriers\\" still contains some fine set pieces. There's one fantastically eerie scene in an abandoned hospital and a somewhat clich&eacute;d but still effective confrontation between the travelers and a trio of HazMat suit bedecked survivalists. Nevertheless, the climax moves for a more low-key, dialogue-oriented approach, and while the conclusion is perhaps a bit on the nose precise, it has a real emotional impact.<br /><br />In spite of my praise for the film, I can hear the critics' responses: \\"Too slow, story too thin, too derivative, thin characters etc.\\" These criticisms aren't w/o merit. Though it is a reconfiguration of old tropes, precious little is truly new, not that much happens and the characters other than the brothers can be a bit thin. (The solid performances across the board, particularly from Perabo and Meloni, add humanity to sometimes underwritten characters.) More important than the limitations, however, is the totality of the film. \\"Carriers\\" is a tapestry of despair, with virtually every element builds towards this goal, all w/o much violence, any real gore or much melodrama. This is perhaps not what most viewers want, but it makes for an affecting experience.<br /><br />Grade: A-efining characteristic of the survivor: they are inclined not so much to brutalize the others, but instead to leave them behind, to simply drive away while the other stands alone on the empty highway with nothing but desert for miles in every direction.

B00005JLD4|5.0|This was a remarkable film about three aboriginal girls, Molly, Gracie and Daisy who set out on a courageous journey through the rough Australian terrain attempting to return to their indigenous homeland after their abduction by the Australian government lands them in an internment camp. Brave Molly leads her sister and cousin on an adventurous quest back to their sacred land to reunite with their mothers while being hunted by an aboriginal tracker hired by the government to capture them. This film entails the struggles of the \\"stolen generation\\" during the time span of the 1880s through the 1960s where half caste children were forcibly removed, often abused and trained to work at specific menial task (1991,Fisher).    In the opening scenes Molly's mother points to a bird flying high above their heads. She informs her daughter that this spirit will protect and guide her which is consistent with most indigenous faiths. Birds are messengers from the spirit world.(1991,Fisher)The movie accurately reflects the importance of keeping one's own sacred beliefs and leaning on years of training for hunting and gathering purposes. Molly's training enables her to seek out food, cover their tracks and outwit the government at every turn. The kindness shown to these three by strangers is heartwarming and at times unexpected. You will find yourself cheering them on against a regime hypocritical enough to have sexual relations with the colored people to produce the half caste yet exclaiming these same offspring must be used to eradicate any further blending.    It is shocking and saddening to see people of high influence committed to a false theory that one race has supremacy over the other. So much so that they force their own beliefs and ways onto a people who possess their own faith which is handed down from generation to generation. Sadly this phenomenon continues even today as the western world seeks to convert so called savages to Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism etc. There isa common nonchalant attitude towards totally uprooting another groups entire way of life in order to transplant a foreign god into their lives. We all have the freedom within ourselves to believe as we are convicted too in our own hearts. Molly fights for this freedom and indeed takes her own back.

B002RD4UZ4|4.0|When Jim-son and I returned from our apple orchard we'd scarcely kept out breath. Leaving out  from our porch was mail-carrier Gypsum, sprite as the time was autumn. I asked her \\"Any sign of it?\\"  She pulled the curled wisp of her sandy-chrome hair from behind her ear and said 'What the hell you   jabbering about, Bert?\\" Jim-son scampered the twisted flight of pine-wood stairs and reached into our  square stainless steel letter-holding box. \\"Tis here!\\" he screamed, raising the first class package   above his head, like Stanley's Cup. Gypsum shook her head and tossed a light load of smokeless tobacco  toward the orchard. Jim-son and I have listened to our one and only thrill every night since. Highly  rec'd.
B0025KVLRO|3.0|I have all but one of the remasters now. The truth is that the remastering works best on the later material. The first couple albums, especially Please Please Me, were recorded in mono and sound best left that way. I have a mono CD version of Please Please Me that was manufactured in West Germany. (I don't know if all of the ones we got here were made there). I made my own CD with the 2009 version cuts immediately followed in succession by their mono counterpart.  The results in general were that the mono version works much better on rockers like 'I Saw Her Standing There', 'Please Please Me' and 'Twist and Shout'. There's more punch, and even though the bass thuds a little bit, it sounds appropriate. The 2009 Remaster comes off better on the ballads like 'Misery' and 'Anna'. There's some subtle instrumentation picked up that isn't there on the mono version. If I had to have one version, it would be the mono version because it feels more accurate to time and place.

I bought one set for home use and like them so much I bought a second pair for my studio.  As a musician I frequently use Shure E5 in-ears and my ears get tired so these are a great trade off when mixing down.  The price and speed at Beach Camera are an added bonus.  Would definitely recommend.

B000A6CLL0|4.0|Enterprise is like the red-headed stepchild of the Star Trek family. There's even a notable amount of die-hard fans who refuse to admit that it's part of Trek at all. I had no interest in this series while it was on the air, and only started watching it after seeing, and thoroughly enjoying, a rerun from the forth season I beleive. Now I have watched every episode in the series and while it certainly had its share of bombs I have come to enjoy the show much more than I did Voyager.<br /><br />Enterprise is a consistantly well-written show with characters you actually get to know and care about; unlike Voyager which rarely had any of those traits during its seven seasons versus four with Enterprise. Season Three involves the Xindi arc, lasting the entire season, which IMO was an interesting idea that I feel pays off story-wise. While there were a few epsiodes not directly related to the overall plot with the Xindi that were downright terrible, the rest of the season makes up for them nicely. In regards to individual eps, I thought season 4 was better, but S3 was also quite good and had some of the best eps of the series.<br /><br />If you're a fan of ST and have yet to involve yourself in Enterprise, as well as having the intention of doing so of course, I would say that even though it isn't necessary to understanding S3, start from the beginning. On the other hand, if you've already been initiated into the series S3 is great due to the fact it follows only one primary plotline, much like the Dominion War on DS9 but with far less side-plots.

0061914177|5.0|I AM A FREELANCE WEB DESIGNER AND A VAY-NE-ACK. Crush it! is a business book unlike any I have ever read --it's a quick read, too!     There are a few things I don't like about most business books, that I bet you don't like either!    Mo' MONEY     First, I really can't stand the \\"get rich quick\\" angle, also closely related is the \\"make billions working just a few hours a day\\" idea. These sound too good to be true, because for 99.999% of us, it's not true. Gary doesn't offer any overnight success or leisure wealth, he offers a simple formula -- do what you love the most, do it better and work harder at it than anyone else and you will win.    PASSION    I have a hard time getting into many business books, because they seem so focused on the dollars that I can't relate. Sure, money is nice, everyone needs it. But money is not the reason I went into business for myself! In all honestly, If I had stayed at the design firm I was at before breaking out on my own 1.5 years ago, I would probably be making a larger income there than I am right now. It's not about that. I was working 60, 70, 80 hour work-weeks and realizing that I could do the same thing for myself and have a better investment in my future! Instead of building up someone else's brand, I could build my own and I could do it on my own terms! Crush It acknowledges that success is not only about dollars and cents, long term success has to be fueled by passion!    AUTHENTICITY & LEGACY    I came of-age very actively involved in my local independent music scene, from the ages of about 16 to 20, there wasn't one weekend that I was not out at the local shows supporting small bands and the \\"do-it-yourself\\" culture that surrounded that. It was being a part of that culture that made me shy away from design in the first place, associating it with sleazy advertising agencies and the \\"evil-corporate-machine, blah blah blah.\\" This same anti-establishment attitude is what of course also makes me chuckle to myself when I tell people I am  a business owner. Of course, I've grown up a lot since then, but I still have a strong appreciation for business who are really doing it RIGHT, who are honest and who don't let big bucks turn them into heartless machines. It's refreshing to read a business book that acknowledges money is important, but also that the legacy you leave is what really holds weight with the people who matter!
B002TBS67C|5.0|Hard to imagine that in Tchaikovsky's day, this concerto was considered so difficult as to be all but unplayable. Now we have Julia Fischer dancing her way through it seemingly oblivious to the technical challenges, like it's a Kreutzer etude or Strauss waltz. Anyway, this concerto showcases Fischer's wonderful lyricism and huge sound -- kind of the string instrument equivalent of a big bold Bordeaux. I don't love everything Fischer's done but this is an absolutely delicious Tchaikovsky -- probably a recording that's going to be talked aboud and treasured. I assume this was recorded on her Guadagnini; this fiddle is fantastic -- especially the lower three strings.

I have also recently read the graphic novel and the movie is as close as they come to a great portrayal of the characters.  Most of the things changed were just fine by me, such as the ending, and all of the actors fit their respective roles perfectly, and that's not an exaggeration.  For fans of the story, watch this movie!

B000244EMO|4.0|If there was any way to make this movie better it would be to get the collector's edition. The first Predator movie is one of my favories starring Arnold, but he's been in so many it's tough to remember them all. The writing was solid, the action was great, the cast worked well together, and the story marked the beginning of an overall decent series, which was later combined with the Alien storyline to make another series of movies, comics, and games.<br /><br />This flick falls into my era of movies, so naturally I give it a bit more latitude than it may deserve. Having said that, I would not only recommend this movie to people who grew up in the 80s, but also to anybody who enjoys an entertaining sci-fi/action film. This product was a gift so any extras are unknown to me.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I have read the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons but this book is, by far, my very favorite.  I have been an avid reader for more than 40 years and this is one of my top ten 'best read choices'.  I could not wait for my daily work to be complete so I could continue this story.  Two separate times I was so utterly shocked by where the story line went that I had to put the book down ... but I quickly picked it up again to continue.  I have recommended to all my friends and have researched some of the things he references in the book.  GREAT READ!
B002TYZKIM|4.0|I grew up listening to Michael Jackson and have always loved his music.  Like so many others, I was extremely saddened that he passed away at such a young age.  I did not have an opportunity to see the film in the theater and was totally looking forward to purchasing the DVD.  The movie was, of course, fantastic!  And even though the actual concert never took place, you get a real sense of what it would have been like!     However I do have one complaint and it's a BIG one!  Once the DVD loaded and started to play, imagine my surprise and total disappointment to see that indoctrination was being promoted by showing Obama propaganda.  Not only does the DVD start this way, but there is also a segment on Obama in the special features section.  I do not support Obama and certainly would not have purchased this DVD had I known this type of propaganda was on it.  I have read the entire cover on the DVD case and there is no reference made that this type of propaganda is included.  I wish I could return the DVD and get my hard-earned money back!!!  For this reason, I only rate this movie as 4 stars.
0307278255|5.0|Lahiri's short stories are incredibly well written and draw me in every time I begin reading one. I am not Bengali, but find myself relating to her stroies as the son and son-in-law to foreign-raised parents. Lahiri's characters are always well developed for such short stories and her dialogue is real. This is why I read her books. I tend to agree with other reviews, however, that the backdrop of each story and character seems to be repetitive - second generation Bengalis with parents who immigrated from Calcutta end up at top colleges and universities in the northeast on the high hopes of their parents. But perhaps this is what she knows from her own life. I particularly enjoyed the three intertwined stories of Hema and Kaushik at the end of this book as I could relate to some of their experiences. Overall, I enjoyed this book and respect Lahiri's talent. Her stories are full of the emotional ups and downs of life. But, by the end of the book, I was ready to read of non-Bengali characters.

0141439513|5.0|By far one of Jane Austen's most celebrated novels, Pride and Prejudice exists as a groundbreaking novel that paved the way for entertainment today. Think of Pride and Prejudice as a 19th century daytime soap chock-full of deceit and motive. Without the novel, we would probably live in a world free from \\"Gossip Girl\\" and \\"The Hills\\". Well, I guess that wouldn't be such a tragedy. But overall, Pride and Prejudice displays Austen's precise use of the English language, coupled with intricate interpersonal relationships that are sure to keep readers amused.<br /> Pride and Prejudice centers on the Bennets, a middle class family living in 19th century rural England. The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet, is witty and attractive while her older sister Jane is shy and sensible. Their younger sisters, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia exist as foils; as they are immature and ridiculous. Also in contrast, Mrs.Bennet is scatter-brained and judgmental, while Mr. Bennet is serious and dislikes any frivolity.<br /> The Bennets' world is turned upside down when a wealthy gentleman named Mr.Bingley arrives at his country home in a neighboring town. Accompanying Mr.Bingley are his snobby sisters and his impolite friend Mr.Darcy. It is when the Bennets, particularly Elizabeth and Jane, begin to intermix with their upper class arrivals that the drama is truly set in motion. The characters from both economic classes experience love, heartbreak, deceit, loss, and the side effects of pride and social standing.<br /> For those readers who seek an action packed, plot driven novel, Pride and Prejudice is not for you. The novel relies on character development and there are several chapters where the plot remains stagnated. Also, it is difficult at times to decipher some of the text, due to the fact that it is written in antiquated English. Again, this book is not for you if you do not wish to interpret phrases such as \\"she fancied herself nervous\\" (page 7) or \\"a mixture of quick parts\\" (page 7).<br /> Although it is more of a difficult read and is often stagnant, Pride and Prejudice has remained a classic for a reason. The novel's romanticism and elaborate depiction of characters has and will continue to make it a favorite among readers.
B002VWNICW|5.0|I have seen this version and the much lauded 1995 version, and in my opinion I find this to be the best version.  Keira Knightley turns in her best film performance here!  The supporting cast is excellent, and the settings sumptuous.  I enjoyed the 1995 version, but this version is flawless!!!
B000BKDOB6|3.0|Before I start the review, just some cultural context:  I am a 58 year old conservative evangelical Christian who listens to a broad range of music.  I did not \\"grow up\\" Christian but came to Christ at age 32.  I am a musician and music lover.<br /><br />I bought this recently because I'm in a phase right now where I'm reconnecting with some 60's & 70's music that a) I knew in those days, or b) I never quite got to know.  \\"Horses\\" is the latter.  At 58 years old now, I realize there are a number of landmark albums that I never really gave a chance in their day.  So I took the plunge (ahem) and bought this double set.  I have to say that the remastered original studio is amazing and hit me hard.  John Cale's production is all over it, and there are spots that have the understated energy of the first Velvet Underground release.  Patti's lyrics are extraordinary, if disturbing. The band knew its limitations (or at least Cale did, if you please) and their minimalist contribution works well.  This is a 5-star CD.<br /><br />So why the 3-star review?  Three words: the live CD.  I really, really, really wanted to like the 2005 live performance, especially with Tom Verlaine playing on every cut.  BUT:  I'm sorely disappointed in the performance , most deeply with Patti's reimagining of \\"Land.\\"  The original was understated and explosive at the same time.  30 years later, this live version finds Patti's \\"additions\\" self-indulgent and gratuitous.<br /><br />Why do I think this?<br /><br />  1) \\"Land\\" - Her use of m....r f.....r and f....g over and over just gets old fast.  I don't say this as an offended \\"Christian,\\" (I hope) but as a discerning listener. \\"Johnny\\" is morphed from an innocent boy (in the original) into an \\"angry young man\\" who now dares his attacker to bring it on.  He is no longer a victim, but just an amoral collaborater. I don't believe in Johnny anymore, and the transformation just doesn't work.<br /><br />  2) \\"Land\\" again - 5 minutes of a reprise of \\"Gloria\\"???? Why???  The lead-off song is already longer than the original, and ends with a silly \\"rock-star\\" flourish.  Why jam it in again to \\"Land\\" and inflict the same indulgence.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.  Having 17 minutes to improvise does not bring out Patti's best.<br /><br />  3) Whole performance - Where the heck is Verlaine?  One of the finest post-punk guitarists ever is barely utilized (except on \\"Birdland\\").  I understand that the original band had serious limitations, and played within them.  Great; it worked.  But why compress Verlaine's talent into those limitations?  The 17 minutes of \\"Land\\" could have used 5 minutes of his genius licks instead of the eye-rolling rehash of \\"Gloria.\\"<br /><br />  4) Whole performance again - Just not well-thought out.  It should have been stellar in scope and realization, and expanded versions should have been revelations.  Nope:  Instead, the best moments on the live CD are those that most resemble the original.  What a shame and what a waste.<br /><br />***OTHER ISSUES per interviews with Patti:<br /><br />1) The opening line of \\"Gloria\\" is not a slam at Christianity, but a personal refusal of Patty to be \\"boxed-in\\" by her mother's Jehovah's Witness teachings, and a noble, if misguided, attempt to take responsiblity for her own mistakes.  Her rejection of Christ's sacrifice makes me sad--because Jesus DID indeed die for her sins--but she is not attacking those who do believe.<br /><br />2) Several reviewers here and elsewhere have referred to the middle section of \\"Gloria\\" as being some kind of lesbian celebration. This is careless listening at best. Patty has refuted this view directly in old and recent interviews by pointing out that she sings as different characters in different songs, and that in \\"Gloria\\" she is singing from a man's point of view.  She clearly is not lesbian herself (not ever, if you follow her history, esp her marriage to Fred Smith);  she simply affirms her freedom to make her singing persona cross genders when necessary.<br /><br />OK, enough.  Neither my disappointment with the live stuff, nor my concern with Patty's apparent personal rejection of Christ does anything to detract from my free praise of the remaster of the truly great original \\"Horses\\" CD.  Powerful and thoughtful stuff for any generation.<br /><br />Cheers, Rick.

B00335EQ3Q|4.0|Baz Luhrmann made a splash with his sparkling musical \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" but before that film, he made a little splash with the colorful romantic dance film \\"Strictly Ballroom.\\" It lacks the polish of his later works, but romantics will love the ugly-duckling love story.<br /><br />Scott (Paul Mercurio) shatters a ballroom dancing contest when he suddenly breaks from routine and begins dancing his own exuberant steps. His mother (Pat Thompson) is shattered, and his diva dance partner (a very made-up Gia Carides) drops him for a champion. But Scott still wants to dance his own steps, not the rigidly prescribed ballroom dances -- even if it means he won't win.<br /><br />As he's dancing, plain Fran (Tara Morice) appears in the dance studio and begs Scott to take her as his partner -- she loved his dancing, and she wants to dance with him, even if they won't win. At first he refuses, but then he starts teaching her to dance at night. And despite the interference of potential partners and irate families, the two begin to fall in love -- and dance to set the floor on fire.<br /><br />The story is extremely simple, so much so that at times it starts repeating itself. Okay, we have the free-spirit-learns-to-be-true-to-himself, plus an ugly-duckling-falls-for-a-swan story. But it's the execution that is charming, full of color and fire and outstanding dancing. And its simplicity keeps it from feeling rushed, although the complications late in the film seem rather contrived.<br /><br />Luhrmann is known for his use of color and textured scenery, and it doesn't fail him here -- though some scenes are relatively bland, he throws in splashes of red and flashing lights, such as the giant Coke sign that flashes behind the dance partners. The ballroom competition is a spectacular opener. And the choreography is outstanding -- the actors exude sensuality and sexiness, mingled with a sort of worldly innocence.<br /><br />Paul Mercurio is an okay actor, but a spectacular dancer. It's impossible to see him dance (a mix of Latin dance, Riverdance, and breakdance) without feeling a thrill. Tara Morice, with less spectacular dancing, is excellent as the plain, awkward Fran. The secondary characters like diva dancer Liz and stage mother Shirley tend to be two-dimensional. The exception is Barry Otto as Scott's dad, who dances his own wild moves when no one is watching.<br /><br />\\"Strictly Ballroom\\" is a sweet, sensuous story about being true to oneself, about love, and about how \\"a life lived in fear is a life half lived.\\" A rough-edged gem.Latin dance, Riverdance, and breakdance) without feeling a thrill.

B001KOFH2G|5.0|The Firefly TV series was one of the best and died a very untimely death.  Hopefully it will be resurrected by one of the cables.  And of course Serenity is a truly great movie that stands by itself even if you've never seen the series.  But it will make you want to see the series.      Anyway, back to the Blu-Ray.  We had the normal DVD and it was good.  Before we saw the Blu-Ray we thought the regular DVD was great.  Now we know it was only good.  Not only is it a terrific action adventure movie but it is definitely one that you can use to fully show off your 1080p TV and your super surround sound system.  It is reference quality.  Grab it, turn the sound up, push play and enjoy!
0812550706|4.0|I have been looking for a great sci-fi story that isn't the usual recycled crap you see on TV's and most sci-fi books these days.  Granted this isn't exactly a new book, but it really caught me up in the story.  I started to feel for Ender and his unusual situation.  The storyline takes a while to develop, but it never seems tedious to get the details of the world Ender lives in.  I love his experiences at the battle school as I was imagining myself performing the tasks he performs and wondering how well I would do myself.  The book really puts you in the story and that's why it gets 4 stars.
1420922254|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.ongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

B002SF9YUM|4.0|There are many reasons to see this film, not the least of which is the continuing fascination with the subject of the story.  Three of Spain's brightest artists of the first part of the 20th century each had live that have fascinated readers and historians for decades.  While this 'quasi-accurate' biographical script by Philippa Goslett is not the definitive documentary many have been waiting for, at least it is a wild quilt of bits and pieces of each of the artists' creative lives - and some of their private lives as well.<br /><br />1922, Spain, and the art school in Madrid is ripe with talent: poet/playwright Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca (Javier Beltr&aacute;n) has already published some of his poems, Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (Matthew McNulty) is more involved with the political festering of fascism and what will become Franco's Spain than he is with concentrating on the brilliant films he will eventually make, and the newly arrived Salvador Dal&iacute; (Robert Pattinson) is making visually shocking entrances in wild clothing while rebelling against the current fads in art.  The three bond, encouraged by the writer Magdalena (Marina Gatell) who merely wants to become not only a famous feminist writer but also a part of the obvious changes in art these three men represent.<br /><br />The sexuality of Garc&iacute;a Lorca is clear: he finds himself drawn to the creative but peculiar Dal&iacute;.  Dal&iacute;'s preferences seem to include both men and women and as their beautiful friendship evolves it is Dal&iacute; who ultimately runs to Paris out of self-doubt and homophobia.  Madrid may be avant-garde, but there is a strong anti-gay contingent (including oddly enough Bu&ntilde;uel) and the discord politically and artistically forces many to flee to Paris, the mecca of art.  The bruised and rejected Garc&iacute;a Lorca finds solace in his creation of a traveling theater for his own plays while Dal&iacute; marries Gala in Paris and completes the famous film 'The Andalusian Dog' with Bu&ntilde;uel.  When the three men (and Magdalena) eventually meet again some years later the world has changed, even if old feelings haven't.<br /><br />If the story sounds disconnected, it is.  There are some very beautiful scenes from director Paul Morrison: a scene with Garc&iacute;a Lorca and Dal&iacute; in an almost underwater ballet is sensuous and beautifully photographed.  Javier Beltr&aacute;n is a sensitive actor and does well with the little he has to work with as Garc&iacute;a Lorca.  Robert Pattinson can't quite find the level of the bizarre personality of Dal&iacute; - it would take a really fine actor to accomplish this.  But the general casting is good.  The editing of this movie is some of the worse on record (Rachel Tunnard) and that factors in a problem with the flow of the film.  But for a diversion and another look at the arts in the early 20th century, LITTLE ASHES is entertaining. It could have been so much better.

0375507256|5.0|Horatio Hornblower, Captain Picard, J. Alfred Prufrock and Brenda Starr go into a bar. This postmodern novel juxtaposes stories from the South Seas, an escape to Bruges, a California ecological maelstrom, and an android future dominated by corporations. Reminded me of David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest, although more easily enjoyed and I didn't miss DFW's footnotes. These crumpled \\"manuscripts\\" are handed over under bizarre circumstances; the music resonates; slavery reestablishes itself; the human mind injects and rejects deviousness: to read this book is to peel back the layers of an onion.

B002C2XXJY|4.0|There are several things I like about the cd, First, clean lyrics. If you're buying it for your kids, you wont have to worry about 2500000 curse words every two seconds. Next, the song writers wrote about things that almost anyone of any age who has been in or are currently in an romantic relationship can relate too. The cd has mostly a rock sound to it, but also has a couple of good ballad style songs perfectly placed.  I would compare Miss Lovato's Angelic voice to that of Ann Wilson of Heart or perhaps Olivia Newton John or Kate Bush (yes Miss Lovato, if you're reading this, I'm comparing you to some of the legends in music. She can really hit the high notes, and does it at exactly the right moment. Whether the cd was thrown together in a rush or thoroughly worked on for months, the result is a masterpiece.   Plus the fact that the songs don't all sound the same is an added bonus.   It is a cd anyone can dance to, and for many who enjoy singing, a great cd to sing along with, as it contains a booklet with lyrics.   If you are tired of only collecting songs for mp3 players and want an charming compact disc to add to your displayed eollection, & if you enjoy good rock music, I would urge you to purchase Here We Go Again.

B001TOD9VI|5.0|I love this movie.  Netflix delivered the blu ray to my house and I have watched it twice and I will watch it again this weekend.  I have never been a fan of Mickey Rourke and I have never been a fan of wrestling.  None of that matters.  Mickey Rourke should win best actor for this role.  I don't know if he did or not because I don't watch award shows.  This movie is EXCELLENT!  Instant Classic.  Right up there with Rocky.  Maybe it is because I am approach 45 and having a mid life crisis or maybe because the 1980's were my best days too.  Maybe because I love hair metal music or maybe because I agree with Randy The Ram \\"The 90's sucked!\\"
0765350386|5.0|I originally picked up Mistborn because I was curious about Sanderson's writing style.  My friends keep trying to get me started on the Wheel of Time series, but I didn't want to commit myself to that monster if I didn't like the way the last books were written (Sanderson's).    After just a few hours, all of my worries were gone.  Mistborn is an amazing book that just sucks you into the world.  The whole thing just feels fresh.  If you're looking for a good fantasy read that breaks away from the standard fantasy formula, Mistborn is the book for you.  The unique magic system and completley unlikely hero, makes this series different from any other that I've read, in a good way.
1416594884|3.0|Did you ever watch those people who make amazingly intricate woven rugs, and you wonder how it's done and how do all those little patterns get in there?!  Starting A Most Wanted Man this reminded me of seeing those beautiful rugs being made.  Characters are complex, and there are quite a few to keep track of; the story is engrossing with several layers of intrigue; and then I kept wondering what else can be stuffed into one book (or how many more patterns can they jam into this rug before you get sick and dizzy looking at it?)  I was totally hooked until about a third the way thru, then I had to flip back to see which lady this one was and how she fit in again.  Then I set it aside.  Then I decided to totally start over again, maybe I was just being lazy the first time around... I got 2/3 way thru before life had to be tended to again.  I knew as soon as I set it down I would never go back--it was just too much to keep track of for me.  I really really wanted to get all the way thru the book, but I need a total week of no life/work, a notepad to jot down all the angles being worked, a white board to map out all these people and where they fit in... Just can't dedicate that much effort to this book.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I read all four books and loved this one the best! It tied up all the open ends yet left many options open to explore if she so desires. To all of the fans that were SO disappointed what the heck were you expecting? They had to grow up! It had to move further. Edward and Bella couldn't go on for the next eight books LONGING for each other! That alone was about to make me shoot myself. As for it getting more sexual, and graphic in it's depiction of violence all of the parents against this need to grow up! What the heck do you think kids in ALL schools hear and discuss in school? Yes yours included! Wake up and stop living in la la land! Go read a couple of facebook pages and it will make this book read like &#34;the cat in the hat&#34;. How did the naysayers expect it to read? I hope she writes another book with it going on to tell us more about Bellas power and Renesme and Jacob. I can't wait Steph please write another one!

B002OEBMN4|3.0|I was really excited when I heard that SLAYER was coming out with a new CD and that they had returned to their old form of thrash. When I first put this CD on, I was almost blown away, but as the others have notted the production wasn't that great and i felt that there were some things missing and over all it could have been better. But still it clocked in almost as long as Reign In Blood and yes the songs were fast and thrashy. The only song that I do skip is Americona. The rest I really got into.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I like it, sure I did. I still can discuss it for hours if someone can hold my conversation.

Still, Mr Brown is shortening the time of their thrillers, from days (The Davinci Code) to a day (Angels and Demons) to hours (The Lost Symbol) through intelligent flash backs, congratulations!!!

1400052173|5.0|There are several fine reviews of this most interesting book of science journalism and creative non-fiction.  The story of Henrietta Lacks and the HeLa cell line is most engaging and contains elements of science, health, racism, moral ambiguity, corporate greed and accurate communication.  It raises the question of whether you want the doctor who removed your mole to obtain modest profits through his/her own research endeavor, or a biopharm giant to extract huge sums from growing the results of your biopsy.  Like another reader the only criticism I would have of this interesting book of science journalism is the extent to which it reports on the life histories of Ms. Lacks extended family.  I believe the story could have been well reported without delving into the life stories of so many relatives.  But this is an excellent informative and thought provoking book.
0380730367|5.0|This is an excellent ending to the Kenzie/Gennaro series.  It would be interesting if Lehane ever writes another contemporary novel, unlike his two most recent period novels, to at least have Patrick, Angie and Bubba appear in cameo roles.    Here is my take on where they are now in 2010:  Patrick and Angie close their private investigation business.  They marry and have two kids, a boy and a girl.  The kids attend Catholic school, despite Patrick's objections.  Bubba discovered that he is a computer savant.  After hacking into the IRS computer system and wreaking havoc, he is arrested.  Instead of going to jail, he is hired by the feds as an anti-hacking expert.  He is also married to Vanessa.  Angie is head of campus security at Boston University.  And Patrick, well, he is a nationally acclaimed novelist.  His early books drew heavily from his days as a private investigator. Patrick, Angie and Bubba have not been shot, stabbed or beaten up since 1999.  Okay, Bubba still punches Patrick when Patrick calls him Ruprect!        What I like most about this book is that Bubba is a major presence throughout the book.  In previous novels, he only made brief, albeit spectacular, appearances.  We learn about Bubba's childhood and young adulthood.  This gives us at least a partial understanding of why he is the way he is now.  Most importantly, we learn why he is so devoted to Patrick and Angie and it is heartbreaking.

0307454541|1.0|I don't usually read mysteries but I heard such good things about this book that I figured I would check it out.  I normally love foriegn language books that have been translated to English. I enjoy the different writing styles.<br />  So with pleasant expectations I cracked open this book.  I read about 20 pages and realized that the writing was not drawing me in, nor the characters. I decided to keep reading, and after about 60 pages or so I knew that the book was doomed. There was nothing to the writing, or author's voice that was drawing me in, or even remotely interesting. The characters were all so cliche, even for me as an American.  It was like reading a really mad mystery novel. I pushed on, and after about 150 pages I finally decided to give up.  I was simply not interested in any of it.<br />  There are so few books that I could ever have put down after over one hundred pages and never gave another thought to. I mean I actually don't care one bit what happens to the characters in this book, or the story.  I am astonished that this book is as popular as it is.  Are people only praising this book because it deals with violence against women? Or that there is a young \\"hacker\\" type character with some tatoos and a punky look?  I just don't get it.  If this book is every made into a movie perhaps the movie will give it some much needed life.<br />  I can not recommend this book to anyone, even usual mystery loves.
0375714669|3.0|I wasn't too impressed with the first \\"Persepolis\\" book and, sorry to say, but I am impressed with \\"The Story of a Return\\" even less.<br /><br />Unlike many readers, I like the cartoon-like art of Satrapi's books. I also enjoy her anecdotes. The writer is at her best when she infuses humor in her otherwise dark life story.<br /><br />What I thoroughly dislike is the author herself. It is very rarely that I find no compassion for book characters. I mean, I can find love for all kinds of vile people, but no luck here. I don't know if Satrapi realizes it, but she portrays herself in a very unflattering light - as a self-centered, self-important and self-righteous person. Satrapi is judgmental and hypocritical - she likes to criticize people for the vices she indulges in herself (I still remember her accusing her friend of being a shallow traitor for obsessing over a lipstick and her walkman when she herself was just as obsessed about her Nikes and audiotapes a few chapters before). She is ungrateful and disrespectful (she calls her nun teacher a prostitute after she is reprimanded for having bad manners). She likes to blame her misfortunes on other people when she is the source of them 99% of the time (she leaves her apartment and lives on the streets for 3 months and then complains later she was mistreated). She puts an innocent man into a mortal danger when she accuses him of talking to her in an indecent way, just to conceal the fact that she is wearing lipstick! The list goes on and on. Satrapi is full of self-pity and completely lacks any kind of introspection; she never owns up to any of the bad things she has done or blames herself for her misfortunes. She prefers to write off her bad decisions to indulge in drugs, promiscuity and general self-destruction on her loneliness and her war memories. But she fails to show these connections in any kind of sincere, meaningful way.<br /><br />It is obvious that my dislike for the narrator totally overshadowed the good parts of the book. I just think Satrapi was not (and still is not) a very self-aware person. However, I do see why her superficial, self-pitying and insincere memoir is so well-received. It fits very well into a very popular nowadays trend to vilify Iranian (or any fundamentalist) regime by providing all kinds of disturbing details of Muslim life style for us all to indulge in.rts of the book.

Granted, I have not read the book so I cannot compare the two.  However, this is an excruciatingly boring movie. I don't think even A-list actors could have saved this screenplay. This DVD went straight to the trash can.

B001E45XT4|4.0|Hmmm... they aren't the greatest headphones ever, but i really like this headset.    -Microphone is Very Clear  -Very Comfortable  -Sound Could be Disagreeable    Very Comfy for a closed ear design. Beforehand, i had read many reviews about these \\"pressing down\\" on your head and your ears not being fully enclosed leading to some good amount of discomfort. Its true, this headset does press down on your head the first time you wear them; but after a while they seem to relax and become very comfortable to wear. Ears shouldn't be a problem either, i used to be that dopey big eared kid on the block and these fit nicely over my behemoth ears. Also the pic is a bit misleading the ear-cups look like some sort of hard scratchy foam, its actually an uber comfortable velvet material.    The sound is perfect for gaming, It's very sharp and crisp and can get very, very loud. That aside, while these are cool for trying to find hidden snipers, these are not cool for general music. Bass suffers and so do some Mid Tones, which you'll notice right away. Minus a star for that.    The Mic is possibly the best part. The sound is simply awesome. If what you're looking for is a Good/Loud/Clear sounding mic, this is an option. I bought a second pair for a friend and we were both awed by how clear these were.     They're OK, worth it if you can get them on sale.
B0035WKQ2M|5.0|I loved this movie. It instantly became one of my top 5 ever. Some of the films most intense moments are some of the most intense I've ever seen. Tobey Maguire deserves an oscar for this. Some critics have been saying that this movie is more of a melodrama than the original, but I would greatly disagreee. Great acting from all involved (including the dad) and terrific writing. After I saw it, I couldn't stop thinking about it the rest of the week. Highly recommended.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|Never mind that the format has been done before, ie - the whole movie shot with a camera used by the actors ala Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project. This was a pretty creepy movie that worked for me. Of course, you can surmise actions the characters might have or should have taken in real life, but I bought into it and loved the suspense. The original reviewer nailed it, it's the unknown suspense that makes it great....a big, gory payoff and/or lot's of typcial hollywood scare tactics is probably what today's generation of moviegoers want or need but this was crafted well enough that it made it a pretty believeable unfolding story. I most definitely could see a young couple in their position using todays technology (camera, pc,etc) to try and find out something that's been haunting the girl for years. If you really wanted to nitpick, you could wonder why they didn't make a bigger effort to call the girls parents , at least for support or more information and also get many other people involved. Learning that the movie was a real budget affair makes it all the more impressive. In the end, what makes a horror movie like this successful, is it plays on one of the biggest fears...the fear of the unknown. You never see any actual entity, though you certainly know it's there as the movie progresses. Enjoyed it.
0553381687|4.0|The bottom line: This is an excellent read. But I am exhausted and doubt I will follow the series through to the finish.<br /><br />A lot of attention was required to keep up with the shifting narrations - not just two or three, either. But a few hundred pages in, when I had a more solid grasp of who everyone was and the world that they lived in, I was hooked.<br /><br />It is a pretty incredible feat to have held my attention for 800 pages and not remain with any single character for more than 50 p. at a time. The scope and imagination of the author is incredible. And maybe at some point, when I have recovered and need another doorstop-sized fantasy fix, I'll pick up Book 2.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|This is definitely my favorite of hers, although I pretty much love them all. THis one reveals such growth and depth that it just plain makes me feel good. The voice, the the lyrics, and of course those fantastic instruments complete a wonderful collection. Bravo Norah!!! Well done.
1591843162|5.0|Just finished reading my advanced copy and have to say Seth has written another 'indispensable' guide for those of us interested in excelling in business and life.  A quick and easy read, his thoughtful approach to identifying and addressing the challenges of breaking through the clutter and distractions of day to day work and communications really hit home.  A must read if like me you're a dedicated hard worker looking for the edge to become in 'indispensable linchpin' in your organizations.
B000001GOZ|5.0|I began my classical listening with the Darmstadt generation, and only after listening to modernism for a few years did I begin working my way backwards to the Second Viennese School and then Gustav Mahler. My introductions to Mahler were his Second and his Fifth, which I enjoyed for their variety and the balance of their many elements. The Symphony No. 6, written in 1902-03, proves another finely crafted work.<br /><br />Mahler will probably never be among my favourite composers, as I just love modernism too much, but I admire the Sixth greatly. Just the way he pulls off the timing of the movements is impressive. The Sixth is two movements of conflict, one movement of gentle warmth and a final movement of crushing tragedy. The fourth movement alone is half an hour long, but one's attention is fixed throughout. What makes Mahler great against many mediocre late Romantics is his ability to write music vast in proportion without the slighest bit of bloat. And even today the orchestration seems fresh.<br /><br />Boulez's reading here is satisfying. I cannot agree with people who feel he misses the soul of the music or whatever, as even a literal reading of Mahler's score produces a soundworld typically identified with pathos. The recording quality is also superb. The only controversial matter I see is that Boulez has the Scherzo preceding the Andante, although current scholarship believes that the inner movements should be switched around.
B002OOG6YY|5.0|I have been a fan of manson for a while, mainly his older stuff.  this disc captures everything from american to holywood.  so its all the good stuff.  I must say I have a pretty big collection of Blu Rays, between me and my roomie about 300.  This has to be the clearest sharpest vid quality I have seen yet.  The colors are sharp and distinct I am really impressed the quality here.  The mix in 5.1 comes out great. so if your a manson fan this is some really good quality footage...enjoy
0446567337|2.0|I bought the book because the movie is about to come out in theaters. I've never read Nicholas Sparks before but I loved The Notebook (movie) so I thought I'd give this one a try. Right away, I was bored. All the characters were too nice, doing everything in everyone else's best interest, pretty much all the time. I didn't feel a deep connection between ANY of the characters. I think Sparks was trying to portray love at its highest form, where everyone thinks of other people's needs first, but it just didn't work for me. No excitement. John was so good and \\"reformed\\" that he barely wanted to kiss Savannah. And yet, he blows up over her suggestion regarding his father (whom he never felt particularly close to). He falls in love too fast, is then scared to act on it, and the story overall feels like it was trying too hard. I'm hoping the movie will be better.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian is the WOMAN!!!!  I am a runner who needed an alternate to running and this is it!  It is cardio & strength all in one!  I loved it so much I bought the other DVD by her.  She is just great and the workouts are easy to follow....nothing tricky...just hard work!
B002VJ0576|2.0|This movie has an almost incomprehensible plot involving Inspector Lestrade, who just keeps popping up for no apparent reason and a bunch of mechanical dinosaurs.The visual look and tone seems to be a low budget effort to take advantage of the current steampunk craze.  Nothing works here. The story is lame. The special effects are preposterous.  The acting pathetic. This movie is a waste of time and money.  If you want some Holmes action, wait for the much better Robert Downey Jr. movie to come out.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|This is another movie my wife picked out, and I decided to give it a try.  It's basically a light romantic comedy, and the best word to describe it is 'cute'.<br /><br />The plot isn't quite believable and the characters are somewhat exaggerated, but the movie is still generally well-crafted, so you won't really notice these issues if you approach the movie with the attitude of having fun.  The acting is also fairly solid, and the lead actors can be counted among 'the beautiful people'.<br /><br />Though there's no pretense of this being a deep movie, I was still able to discern four messages: (a) people who don't seem nice might have had a rough background, (b) sons should usually follow their passion in choosing their career path, even when their fathers have other ideas, (c) relationships are more important than money, and (d) romantic love can happen unexpectedly.<br /><br />Overall, I can recommend this movie if this is the sort of thing you're in the mood for.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|I enjoyed it but got tired of it quickly. i found myself reviewing all the zombie movies I've seen and I think he did a great job covering all the bases (and proving movie characters really stupid).
0812971825|5.0|I loved this book, as I have loved all the Elizabeth Strout novels so far. I didn't think I'd like it when I started ... the main character is a minister and that prompted me to think I wouldn't relate to him at all. Goes to show how much first impressions can be so wrong. This is a heart-warming and heart-wrenching story, beautifully told by a master. My current favorite author!
B000KF0NI4|5.0|On blu-ray: a must have for all animation collectors. Beautiful,crystal clear images with fantastic sounds. One of the best releases on Blu-ray.
B0026P3G12|1.0|This is terrible. But what can you expect from an \\"average voice\\". Many are saying she is such a spectacular singer?Go to any intercity churches and you will find in the choirs singer after singer who will make Susan sound like a howling dog. Many will have sad stories in their lives also. Get real. Just goes to show this was nothing but a sad explotation of an over-hyped, average singer.
0385504225|5.0|I have seen all of the movies.  They were good.  My son gave me \\"The Lost Symbol\\" for Christmas.  I read it in two days - two working days!  I am now reading the last two books in reverse order.  I love them also.  Read All Of Dan Brown  He is a wonderful writer.  Michael M
0812550706|4.0|The detailed plot and pace of the book makes it an entertaining read, and it masks some of the book's deficiencies. The only memorable characters to me are Ender and the military guy that first scouts him out. The other characters appear to me to be mere plot devices.<br /><br />(via [...])
B002ZJGN96|5.0|This should kill at the Oscars. It should have killed at the grammys and the golden globes. But then again, the academy is known to make some stupid calls.
B001TN1EBG|5.0|The first thing that you notice about the tracks on this album is the beautiful melody of the music itself.  Fitzsimmons' voice combined with moving acoustic guitar and piano riffs calm the mind and open the heart.  In the midst of being fully entranced by the beauty of the music the lyrics seem to slowly emerge from the background.  By album's end you can't get these lyrics or the melodies out of your head, and you realize Fitzsimmons has taken you on a journey quite common to anyone who has had a heart breaking relationship.      It soon becomes strikingly evident that these are not just lyrics, but they are pure and honest emotions born out of an emotional struggle of grief and regret that was real and personal for Fitzsimmons.  As you listen to his musical monologue it is as if he is bearing his own heart and soul about such a personal experience on an intimate level.  You begin to relate to his experience and find yourself saying, \\"I feel or have felt just like that\\".  It is this ability to make you relate to what he has felt through his music that makes Fitzsimmons a true artist and a rare talent.      This is a great album if you actually want to feel something rather than just listen to something.  I give it 5 out of 5 stars!    Some of my favorite tracks include:      \\"Even Now\\" - with lyrics like \\"How long should I wait, before I let you go?  How long should I decide?  Whose side should I take when both of us are wrong?  When we both share the blame.  Oh but I love you even still, even now, even though we fell apart.  Even still, even now, but I hope we'll meet again.\\"    \\"I Don't Feel It Anymore (Song of the Sparrow)\\"    \\"If You Would Come Back Home\\"    \\"You Still Hurt Me\\"    \\"Find Me To Forgive\\"
B002JIOQCO|1.0|if you listened to a classic rock station your whole life, and then took everything you learned and put it in a blender, and then took a photograph of the blender, it would have more soul in it than this load of empty imitation. how can anyone be a fan of real meat like Sabbath and Zep, but not run screaming from the room when these mindless quoters crank up their songwriting robot? worthless worthless nothingness.    this is to authentic music as a bigmac is to a steak. people, your crap detectors are terribly broken if you can't see that.
B002NFCHBA|5.0|The first review gives you a complete listing of what's included in the set. This set is as advertized - the ultimate complete Chopin edition, played by some of the greatest pianists.  You get 17 discs at the price of 4 regularly priced classical CDs. (1) If you enjoy Chopin, I'd say the only reason not to get this set is if you already have most of these discs in your collection.  I had only a few by Ashkenazy, Pollini and Yundi Li so me the decision was easy: more Ashkenazy and Pollini, plus among the other higlights, Maria Joao Pires and Rafal Blechacz.  I had read reviews praising the recordings of Pires and Blechacz and based on initial impressions, the praise is justified.  (2) If you have no Chopin in your collection but enjoy classical solo piano music, this is a great opportunity, a bargain - this is a great time to be a fan of classical music. Another recent piano box set that I would recommend is Martha Argerich Collection 1 - the Solo Recordings.
B000003BQW|3.0|Mondo Bizzaro being Ramones 12th and 1992 release is what I would consider a punk rock light release. There are elements of punk rock but on the whole it is more of a rock release. Compared to earlier releases such as Rocket to Russia this album is not as good. The best track is their cover of Doors \\"Take it as it comes\\". Allmusic gave it 3.5/5 and Rolling Stone gave it 3. The album is a weak 3.5 but since I can not give it this then it gets 3. 3/5.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|I almost found it not long enough...meaning i could have taken a extra hour of it..<br />  I wont go in details as hundreds of reviewers will probably tell it... but what<br />i can surely say that if you like jumping off cliffs into lakes, or skydiving or<br />anything related you should enjoy this movie a bit more than others cause we have<br />multiple 3d scenes that the camera follows dragon riders off the moutains cliffs<br />and one can 'feel' the motion of the fall making it even more fun for the viewer.<br />Weve seen the storyline in other movies, but movie explores it in 3d and its lots<br />of fun.  Actors and Actresses are pretty decent and im very happy that they included Sigourney Weaver in this one. Man she gave us so much with the Alien franchise that it was great to see her again.<br />  Watching the movie without the 3d, it became just a movie...interesting but<br />its life was the 3d effects.
0439023483|5.0|Wow, this is really a good book. It is listed as a Young Adult novel but I think adults will enjoy it just as equally. I had heard from a few friends that they couldn't put it down once they started reading it -- and it was the same for me.  Once I got invested in the story, I couldn't put it down until I finished. Some of it is a bit graphic (the wolves near the end especially) and had me cringing. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't find the romance to be overdone (unlike another popular teen series *cough* Twilight *cough*). I am looking forward to reading the next in the series.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|For all parents who love their children, watch it with them. Should be made compulsory viewing in all schools, goes to show that big business is all about profit at any expense.. Watch also The World According to Monsanto... It is time to make a stance....
B00000ILDF|5.0|After escaping from the alien planet, the ship carrying Ellen Ripley crashes onto a remote and inhabited ore refinery. While living in the ore refinery until she is rescued by her employers, Ripley discovers the horrifying reason for her crash: An alien stowaway. As the alien matures and begins to kill off the inhabitants, Ripley is unaware that her true enemy is more than just the killer alien. This movie is certainly worth watching and if you're truly a hard core fan.
0446567337|5.0|I loved this book, it made me cry so hard! It is written very well, but not too heavy. Nicholas Sparks is such a great author and I would love to see a Dear John sequal.
B000065V42|5.0|Wayne Szalinski is a crazy scientist who invents a miniaturizing machine that is so powerful it only blows things up. When the kid next door hits a baseball through the window and it lands in the path of the machine's laser, it begins working. Wayne's two kids plus the two kids next door end up becoming tiny. Wayne accidentally sweeps them up and puts them out with the garbage, so the kids then have to travel through the thick grass back to the house, while braving giant bugs, sprinklers and a lawn mower. This is a fun movie for the entire family. Well, of course, it's ridiculous but the kids will love it and you can laugh right along with them.
B00005T7I1|5.0|this movie is fun to watch and perhaps one of my favs. it kinda reminds me of who framed roger rabbit? movie and breathless mahoney (some sort of marilyn monroeish) reminds me of jessica rabbit. i think this movie had madonna's most gorgeous look. i love the curly blonde hair. she falls head over heels for dick, but he is already devoted to his own girlfriend.i remember in the end breathless mahoney dies after dick finds out she's the master of this faceless disguise. i loved her line \\"i don't know whether you want to hit me or kiss me...i get alot of that.\\"

Due to the horrific attack Helen suffered in her past as an agoraphobic she is confined to her apartment. The killer uses this against her in his murderous attempts to become a famous serial killer. Detectives M. J Monahan and Reuben Goetz they have the challenge of trying to capture the killer before he kills again and uses his chance to commit another atrocious murder. \\"Copycat\\" is that rare movie that comes along that has the ability to pull you into it. It takes you on a most terrifying journey into the mind of a serial killer and the doctor that understands him. I can't say anything more, except that I love this movie.
B00007AJGH|5.0|i remember watching this movie when i was younger. i remember that roger had this beautiful, voloptous wife named jessica rabbit (think of a prototype of kim kardashian). yes, he was one lucky guy but i guess he wasn't like other guys who would just lust after her. this movie was funny. i like how all the characters from warner bros, mgm, and disney came together in the end.

The government has decided to send Ripley out of cryostasis and to aid a team of tough, rugged space marines into the desolate planet to find out if there are aliens, or survivors.

B002UXRH10|3.0|yes, rihanna. you're 21 and you've come along way from being that innocent island girl in her pon de replay days. it's her most personal, dark album to date. many may think that her new dark, rebellious image reminisces stripped and the velvet rope or even...michael's bad. rated r is a good album, but there aren't that many songs on here that made me say \\"wow...that's so amazing\\". It wasn't consistent. It started off great til it slipped into mediocrity towards the end. I was really feeling it but it lost me. But i applaud her for expressing herself and finding the right sound for her. musically, it sounds very different from her past albums. she incorporated a more gansta hip hop/rock style. the album cover does remind me alot of grace jones and interestingly they're both from the caribbean. i like the mad house intro..very intresting and it's a nice welcome. if she didn't have photographs, the last song, and cold case love i would have given the album 5 stars. Having those songs on it just completely ruin an album that could have been so perfect.<br /><br />1.Wait Your Turn (5/5)-it sounds like part hip hop and part reggae. i like that. she sounded almost like those reggae artists. i love this line \\"thats just the way the game is played..you just have to wait your turn\\".<br /><br />2. Hard (featuring Young Jeezy) (5/5)-it's pretty smart move to release this as her second single. it got some nice, catchy lyrics to it.<br /><br />3. Stupid in Love (3/5)- this song obviously refers to her abusive relationship with chris and the fact that she had went back with him. bravo to the well-written verses minus the chorus. The chorus is just weak, annoying, and totally kills the song. i could really feel that rihanna could relate to this song really well and it shows through her soul.<br /><br />4. Rockstar 101 (3.5/5)-the guitars in the background were cool..but the lyrics are just pretty average, repetitive and i feel that this song needs something more to it. it sounded too vain in my opinion. it's like she never have a positive, empowering statement to make other than \\"I'm better than all y'all, m####f#####!\\"<br /><br />5. Russian Roulette (2/5)-  I don't really have a problem with the dark lyrics, but I think the music or the melody could have been more dramatic like maybe add some opera or violins in the background. I love the violins in the The Velvet Rope song.<br /><br />6.Fire Bomb (4/5)- i like this song alot. gotta love those guitars. it almost reminds me of richard marx. it should have been released as a single instead of rockstar 101.<br /><br />7. Rude Boy (5/5)- it sounds pretty typical to what they have out now, but it sounds pretty fun and flirty.<br /><br />8. Photographs (featuring will.i.am) (1/5)- I never been a fan of Will.I.Am's work. I find it to be so dull and bland...just like with this song. It just feels so there and lifeless. No interesting beats...nothing that it makes it really stand out.<br /><br />9. G4L (4.5/5)- i love the beats but she sounds repetitive. epic quote \\"i lick the gun when i know that revenge is sweet\\".<br /><br />10. Te Amo (4/5)-not too crazy with the beats, but it's a cool song.<br /><br />11. Cold Case Love (1/5)-  I see that it's a fan favorite, but I never really like this song. It just doesn't do anything for me. It's no \\"In This Life\\" or \\"I'm Ok\\". I just don't feel any sad tones in this song that it supposedly portrays. I just don't feel convinced from hearing the melody or the way that it's been sung. It does not leave me feeling anything<br /><br />12. The Last Song (1/5)- it doesn't make a great closing track. Psst..I probably listened to this song only once or twice because it was just so boring. I wasn't the least bit interested. I think Fire Bomb would have been the better \\"last song\\". At least, you have the guitar riffs to look forward to.oo vain in my opinion. it's like she never have a positive, empowering statement to make other than \\"I'm better than all y'all, m####f#####!\\"<br /><br />5.

B00005JKNC|5.0|THE MAJESTIC    One of Jim Carrey's best films ever and one of his best performances takes place in this film set in 1950's Hollywood when filmmakers were getting blacklisted for supposed communist involvement. Now I am absolutely sure that some were but others were unjustly accused, a lot of people lost everything because of this. Of course whatever you believe you do have the right to do so whether right or wrong as long as no laws are broken. But that does not stop the powers that be from blacklisting Carrey's character in this film. This film is not only a showcase of that period in time but is also speaking to things that are happening now.    Peter Appleton [Carrey] is on his way to becoming a very successful screenwriter with a new film called Ashes to Ashes. Add in that he is dating the lovely star of the film and things could not be looking better. But his bubble is busted when he learns that is time in the biz may be up, he has been blacklisted. Of course he is not a communist but that means nothing to the government, he once accidently sat in a communist meeting in college just to hang out with a girl. That one mistake that he made as a youth has come back to ruin his career and his life. Of course like anybody would do he gets drunk and tries to forget the pain, what a coincidence, he literally does.    After getting into his car and having a few drinks he crashes on a bridge and tumbles into the water. It is here that he cracks his head and wakes up to a dog licking him. He has no idea where he is, how he got there, or even who he is. But the town he makes his way into seem to have an idea of who he is, and it is not a Hollywood writer. It is one of the town's lost sons Luke Trimble, this brings the town to life. But not everyone is happy to see Luke home and some just can't believe it. But Luke's father is convinced his war hero son is back and wants to reopen the family biz, a movie theater called The Majestic. As the town celebrates and Peter or Lukesettles in his memory starts to creep back as the Government get closer to finding him.    This has got to be one of Carrey's best performances without a doubt especially because no one at the time thought he could pull off a more serious role. Carrey shines without a doubt in what most critics bashed, goes to show what the so called professionals know. To be honest this should have at least won some Golden Globes, it is not the best movie ever but it is much better than what people give it credit for. Every person that appeared in this did a marvelous job from the people who played his father, girlfriend in the town, to all of the towns people they all did great. I should note that the movie wrote that he watches at the premiere stars none other than the great Bruce Campbell. Of Course Bruce is my all time favorite actor, one of the best ever.    Directed by Frank Darabont who has made so many good movies does not disappoint in this wonderful film written by Michael Sloane. Sloane needs to write some more films because he did an excellent job with this film. If you have not seen this then you are cheating yourself out of a good film. The performances are great as is the look and feel of the film, old school style look and time period. I would highly recommend this film because it is about trust, loyalty, pride, honor, our war veterans, our freedoms, and so much more. It is not the best film ever but certainly is worth the price of admission at the Majestic.
B002MBAJ4M|5.0|When I first heard Gov't Mule, I thought that they were just a little kickass blues rock trio in the vein of ZZ Top. They had some good riffs here and there, and Warren was a great singer/guitar player, but I've heard better bands and more memorable songs.    That opinion has been flushed down the toilet with this release. To put it quite frankly, this is the best album Gov't Mule has EVER put out, and quite possibly one of the best rock and roll albums of 2009, possibly the decade even. It's all over the place. Barnstomping blues, Hendrix funk, soulful ballads, Led Zeppelin-inspired riffs, psychedelia, and the powerful vocals of Mr. Haynes. It's a fantastic album, and it FEELS like a rock album should sound like. There's a terrific flow to everything.    Broke Down On The Brazos just kicks it. Boogie in the vein of ZZ Top (It even has Billy Gibbons playing guitar), this is one of the heaviest songs the band has ever created (Apart from a certain track I will talk about later in the review.). Warren and Billy tear it up for 6-plus minutes in one of the best guitar duels ever recorded.    Steppin' Lightly is a song that reminds me of old-Mule, but the songwriting and pace of the song works, and it doesn't go into weird forgettable directions like some of the earlier stuff. It all feels right.    Railroad Boy is a reworking of an old Celtic folk song, transformed into something Led Zeppelin would've done circa 1975.    Monday Mourning Meltdown is a fine example of how Gov't Mule has progressed into an amazing BAND, and not just 3 guys backing Warren Haynes. Listen to the trippy keyboard work on this, it's a feast for the ears. And the backwards guitar solo! Just lovely.    Gordon James is a fantastic southern ballad which reminds me of something Counting Crows would do. Lovely song, though I can't place just who it's about though.    Any Open Window is just badassery. You know you're in for some funk when it's dedicated to Mitch Mitchell and Buddy Miles.    Frozen Fear sounds like it would've easily fit onto a Derek Trucks record. While it's certainly the least fulfilling song on the album, it's still quite good, and that's saying a lot.    Forevermore is a dark ballad with some interesting space noises. Very atmospheric song.    Inside Outside Woman Blues #3.....WOAH! Warren lets his hair down with this one! This is borderline heavy metal. If you think Warren has softened over the years, listen to this song. It's just intense.    Scenes From A Troubled Mind is a funky little song with some great slide work. Another keeper from a great album.    And finally, World Wake Up is a dark psychedelic song about how our economy and our world is going down the crapper. It's a fantastic album closer, you could close your eyes and imagine Pink Floyd doing this were it not for the southern accented vocals.    This album has it all. Great songs, terrific playing, showmanship, amazing tones, variety. It's just a perfect album. If you love rock and roll, get this album.      FREEBIRD

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought the Hyper 212 Plus to replace the stock heatsink and fan of the Phenom II 720 BE and I couldn't be happier with the performance. My system is overclocked to 3.4 Ghz and with the stock HSF it was idling at a little over 40 C and at load reaching up to 74 C. With the Hyper 212 Plus I am now idling at 30 C and only 50 C at maximum load. The fan is reasonably quiet even when pushed to the limit.    Installation was very easy, even though it does require the removal of the motherboard. Unlike a lot of people, I found the instructions reasonably easy to understand. It makes me wonder how much effort some people put into trying to figure things out themselves before running to the internet complaining how the product or instructions are poorly designed. I am by no means a system building expert, in fact this is my first build aided only by internet forums and reviews on sites such as Amazon.    This HSF is rather large so it's a good idea to make sure it will fit your system before you buy. Generally speaking, if you have a 120 mm exhaust fan in the back of your case the Hyper 212 should fit fine. (It was incredibly close fit in my Cooler Master RC 310 case, the copper pipes are about 2 mm away from touching the side panel)    I am simply amazed by the performance of this HSF. Sure, there are better looking coolers out there, but you'll be hard-pressed to find one with a better bang-for-your-buck ratio than the Hyper 212 Plus.
1594488878|4.0|Nick Hornby's 2009 novel explores a fictional musician, his biggest fan, and the fan's girlfriend.  Tucker Crowe's Grammy-nominated 1986 album \\"Juliet\\" was a major critical and minor commercial success.  Crowe warranted comparisons to Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen but mysteriously disappeared from public life in the mid 1980s.   Duncan and Annie are in a present-day stagnant cohabitating relationship in a fading seaside town 100 miles outside London, \\"stuck in a perpetual postgraduate world where books and gigs and films mattered more to them than to other people their age\\".  Duncan is a leader of a small cadre of superfans that are described as either \\"Crowologists\\" or obsessed Tucker Crowe fans.  Crowe minutia (especially a website) consumes most of Duncan's leisure time: in the beginning of the story he and Annie spend a multi-week US vacation touring locales from Crowe's life.  Their life is disrupted by the surprise release of an acoustic version of the \\"Juliet\\" album (from which this book gets its title).  Meanwhile, Crowe is actually living in rural Pennsylvania with his son and soon to be ex-wife.  The setting alternates between Annie's England and Tucker's US as the plot becomes more predictable and less plausible.  As in Hornby's most famous book \\"High Fidelity\\", music fandom is a key theme.  As he watches an anonymous bar band, Tucker thinks \\"The trouble with going to see bands is there was nothing else to do but think, if you weren't being swept away on a wave of visceral or intellectual excitement... mediocre loud music penned you into yourself, made you pace up and down your own mind...\\".  I liked Hornby's earlier books like \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About A Boy\\" better, but \\"Juliet, Naked\\" was still worthy of 3.5 or 4 stars.  I didn't notice the cover's clever double image until I was almost finished reading the book!
B000003CUJ|2.0|Such a good idea but so very poorly executed.  Boring conducting and sloppy orchestral ensemble.  There are very many so much better performances of the individual orchestral highlights . . why bother with this one.

In the back I attached an \\"Invoice\\" - and charged N/C for such things as skinned knees, bandaids, nights up with sick children, etc.; I made the invoices very specific from their lives.  I took it with me the next time I went to visit them and read it to them aloud.  It is important to me that my children know just how much I love them and this book says it well.  A precious story -

B002WIDRM6|4.0|I was really excited for the release of this album. After such a great debut album I expected a lot from this group. While the overall content on the CD is good, I am a little disappointed because something just isn't clicking as perfectly this time around. On their debut album I gave them five stars. For this one they get four because there are a couple of flub songs on here, which I felt the previous album didn't have. So lets get the bad songs out of the way first shall we?    THE BAD    Hello World - (1/10) While some people may like this song, (A guy in another review) I just can't seem to make myself like it. Charles sings lead in this one, or from what I have heard of it. My imaginary ADHD kicks on during this song and my brain disengages. I've tried to listen to it a few times but, honestly I can't tell you what it's about because I always end up skipping it, or thinking about other things when it's playing. Why, you make ask? Well the arrangement is dreadfully boring, Charles does nothing to impress me with his vocals in this one, and the tune is just to slow and long (5:26)! I have no problem with long songs but when the song is boring and uneventful it makes it kind of painful. Why this song is on here is beyond me, as they usually use their own songs but, Tom Douglas, David Lee & Tony Lane wrote this song...whoever they are :P    Stars Tonight - (4/10) This song doesn't spin me either, it's hard to relate to. It's basically telling us were all stars tonight at their concert (La Te Da)...this song might actually work if you were at a Lady Antebellum concert in the moment, but on the CD it's cliche in a back rock concert kinda way, and basically pointless. It feels like a filler song to me, although it may have a better effect when the song is sung live.    THE GOOD    Most of the songs on here are good quality. Nothing to write home about, but they are worth a listen, and most people will relate to and enjoy them.          Something 'Bout A Woman - (6.5/10) Being a woman I don't really relate to this one :P However, it's got a good sound to it, and it's kinda got a sweet vibe with innocent and kinda naive lyrics. Charles sings lead and does good with this one. The guys in love will probably like this one, and will find it convenient to say \\"Hey baby, this song reminds me of how you make make me feel, cause your a great woman.\\" (Hint, Hint!)    Perfect Day - (7/10) Big shocker, this song talks about the perfect day. Go figure! Hillary sings lead on this one. It's an uptempo feel good kinda song that would probably be fun live. The tune is catchy and creates an overall sense of good times and fun.    Ready To Love Again - (7.5/10) Hillary sings lead again on this one. This song rounds of the CD nicely. It's short and sweet. Slower tempo. It talks about a person who is ready to start looking for love again.     American Honey - (8/10) Hillary sings lead, she does a good job vocally on this one. This song has a good vibe, beat and sound. This kinda has a summertime/freedom feel to it.         If I Knew Then - (8/10) Charles sings lead. This again is a slower song. It's very pretty, the lyrics are sweet. It talks about a man who loses an opportunity to fall in love, and then regrets it later in life. He basically says if he knew then what he knows now he would have went the extra mile to fall in love.    Love This Pain - (8.5/10) Charles sings lead on this one, and does really well. This song talks about a guy who is in an unhealthy relationship with a women, but can't seem to get away from her, and for some reason she keeps pulling him in.     THE GREAT    My personal favorites are the duet styles between Hillary and Charles. That's where I think they really shine. These last three songs on the album are all duet style, and they all are great in my opinion!       Our Kinda Love - (9/10)Great song. Kinda of almost has a Rascal Flatts feel to it with the arrangement and the sound. It' a very fun song that is basically about two people in love and how they describe their love to you.     Need You Now - (9.5/10)I assume by now that most people have heard this one, but for those of you living under a rock or are new fans, it's kind of a darker and more desperate love song. This song is basically about two people who seem to have separated but are still very much in love and can't take being away from one another any longer.    When You Got A Good Thing - (10/10) This song for me is the best on the CD. Hillary and Charles both sing it beautifully. The lyrics are gorgeous, and you can't help but fall in love with this song it's so powerful. I think it could be a really big hit for them. The song is slower, but not to slow. It talks about two people who have got this great love together.       Overall, this CD is still a really great one, and worth the buy. The feeling and vibe is similar to their first album, but again there is a bit of something missing in this one. However, it's still a lot better than most of the other junk some artists try to pass off as good music.
B001F290E4|5.0|If you love old school, you will love this cd. I've heard some of these song done by other artist and did not do so well with them. Seal did a wonderful job with these. Keep up the good work!!!
B001QOGYFO|2.0|Remember John Carpenters THE THING?  The loneliness, the foreboding awe of the polar wilderness, the terror of hopelessness.  If you're expecting that kind of feeling from WHITEOUT, you might be as disappointed as me!<br />The plot is almost indiscernible.  It's shot so sloppily, there are times you can't even tell what's going on.  Kate Beckinsale who CAN act (e.g. THE AVIATOR and NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH) looks totally disinterested; Alex O'Loughlin, Gabriel Macht and Tom Skeritt are flaccid and dull.  I had expected more but the problem with WHITEOUT is it's just boring!
B000OT8GCQ|3.0|If you're going to read a romance novel, you want it to leave you happy. This one just left me throwing it across the room because of the ending.  I liked this novel, although there wasn't much character development if you ask me.  I still occasionally pick up Sparks books because he writes in a style that is easily read, even for the person who doesn't read avidly. I'm an avid reader and his novels are like bubble gum, easy to read and highly predictable for the most part.  This one did not veer away from that formula, however the ending...yes I wanted to begin taking pages out of this book and lining someone's cat litter box with them when I got to the last page.    Is that how a romance book should leave you feeling?  I mean I've read lots of books where even the boy doesn't get the girl..and I've never wanted to pitch the book.  The one big redeeming quality of this book was the character of John's father.  Nicely written character examination.  However...one character does not make for a book that's memorable.  I enjoyed Message in a Bottle and even fell for Nights in Rodanthe...even that ending wasn't this dissapointing.  It was bittersweet.  I'm sure some may disagree, so judge for yourself.  But for me....all those pages of reading (which didn't take but mere hours) did not pay off when I got to \\"THE END\\" like a romance novel should.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|There is nothing in this book new or different than Angels and Demons or Da Vinci Code.  He should be a little ashamed to charge people for this story still one more time.    It's not necessarily a bad book - just the same story again.

1577314808|5.0|Without gushing too much about Tolle's obvious feat, I think it's fair to say that this book opens its readers to the timeless truth that each of the world's wisdom traditions point out through their most sacred teachings. Put succinctly, he nails it with a secular voice and a common sensibility. What's more, readers will be able to uncover techniques that will help them enter the timeless and eternal without having to subscribe to anything other than their own deepest sense of authenticity.
6301971272|4.0|Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly from 1966 is the final movie in The Man With No Name trilogy featuring Clint Eastwood. This spaghetti western filmed in Spain with mostly Italian actors is so spare that it is almost a silent film. In fact, it plays like a Greek tragedy. The 2005 special edition runs three hours. IMDb rates it as 9.0 and #4 of the 250 best movies of all time.<br />It is easy to spot the flaws in the movie from the very beginning. The scenery and buildings do not look at all like the American West. Most of the actors' voices are dubbed. The highly praised soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is incredibly repetitive.<br />This film is all skin and bones and no meat. The Greatest Western Of All Time has to be Judge Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid from 1969. It has great acting, humor, an excellent score and beautiful scenery. Hey, it even goes to Bolivia.
B000TBI40I|3.0|'Hey Jude' is a bits-and-pieces album that collects The Beatles' non-album singles and B-sides: 'Paperback Writer' and its B-side 'Rain', 'Hey Jude' and 'Revolution', 'John And Yoko' and 'Old Brown Shoe', 'Lady Madonna' (but not its B-side), and 'Don't Let Me Down' (B-side of 'Get Back'). And somehow 'Can't Buy Me Love' and 'I Should Have Known Better' found their way on here as well, despite being present on 'A Hard Day's Night'.     While these songs are outstanding and represent some of the best music of their time, as a collection the album itself is full of shortcomings.     Firstly, these represent singles that were absent from the American, not British releases. Songs like 'I Feel Fine', 'We Can Work It Out', 'Day Tripper', 'Strawberry Fields Forever', 'Penny Lane' and 'All You Need is Love' have appeared on various US-only releases, and are not present here. So really, unless you have the American versions of the studio albums, 'Hey Jude' will seem incomplete. There are simply too many songs missing for those who have the original British versions (which would be most people).     Secondly, this album has basically been superceded by better collections such as 'Red'/'Blue' and 'Past Masters', which between them contain virtually all of the non-album singles plus B-sides. 'Past Masters' in particular is an important album for dedicated fans seeking key B-sides like 'This Boy', 'Yes It Is', 'She's A Woman', 'I'm Down', 'Rain', plus rarities such as 'The Inner Light' and 'You Know My Name'.     So 'Hey Jude' doesn't contain enough singles to be a complete package, and what songs it does contain can be found on better collections. Unfortunately, despite this containing some outstanding individual songs, there's just not much point in buying this anymore.
B002OEBMN4|4.0|Well, i can honestly say i've been a slayer fan for well over a decade. i got hooked with show no mercy. i sort of lost touch with them in the 90's (honestly i think slayer sort of lost touch with who they are during this time). I started getting back into them when i bought christ illusion, and this album is even better. a bit more refined, i think it's their best album. world painted blood, hate worldwide, and psychopathy red are the strongest songs off this album, but honestly there isn't really a bad song on this album. you can listen to it over and over and it doesn't get old. now, i realize alot of people don't like this album for it's production, but give greg fidelman a break! slayer liked working with him, and this album is probably the best representation of their sound. i know many fans will swear by reign in blood, or south of heaven, or seasons. but i think this album has something that no other slayer album has.....a true sense of identity. the album is all about the riffs and the beats. there is no heavy emphasis on religion which i think has always worked against slayer, not for them. i listen to these guys because they come up with the best riffs and instrumentals in metal music, period. no band can touch slayer in that department. anyway, if you are a new slayer fan, buy world painted blood. if you are an old slayer fan, buy world painted blood. this album is a masterpiece.
B000002UZ1|5.0|'Blue' kicks off from where 'Red' finished, covering the important songs from The Beatles' later career. This includes some of the band's most ambitious and varied music, from the psychadelia of 1967 to the back-to-basics rock of 1968-9. Once again, the album does a fine job of collecting the hits, B-sides, and fan favourite album tracks from the period.    All of the band's later singles are included; 'Strawberry Fields Forever', 'Penny Lane', 'All You Need Is Love', 'Hello Goodbye', 'Lady Madonna', 'Hey Jude', 'Get Back', 'John And Yoko', 'Something', 'Let It Be'. There are also some very important B-sides here: songs like 'I Am The Walrus', 'Revolution', 'Don't Let Me Down' and 'Old Brown Shoe' (a lost classic!) hold their own next to the big hits, and could easily have been released as A-sides themselves.    Again, the album is rounded out by some key album tracks: 'With A Little Help From My Friends', 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds', the epic 'A Day In The Life' and the title track are obvious inclusions from 'Sgt Pepper'. 'Abbey Road' is correctly represented by 'Here Comes The Sun' and 'Octopus' Garden' in addition to the singles, while 'Across the Universe' and 'The Long And Winding Road' are obvious selections from 'Let It Be', even if they are the over-produced Spector versions. And while it's impossible to represent the sprawling White Album in a few songs, at least 'Back In The USSR', 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' and 'Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da' are well-known fan favourites from the album.    Once again, the sheer number of brilliant songs that were merely album tracks highlights just how good The Beatles were. One thing 'Blue' also demonstrates that 'Red' doesn't is the growing songwriting skills of George and Ringo....'Something' especially holds its own against any Lennon/McCartney track.    As with 'Red', this is pretty much the complete package, with complete lyrics and various late 60's photographs. Once again, any half-serious fan needs to get the original albums, but the number of non-album singles and B-sides here make 'Blue' another essential album for all Beatles enthusiasts.     Five stars once again.
B000002HJR|5.0|this is down's best album. phil's voice is still intact (it changed over the years due to his screaming and drug use), and the songs and production is the best of any down album. if you buy down 2, you get ghosts of the mississippi, lysergik, and new orleans. that's about it off that album. down 3 is probably the second best, you get three suns, nod, on march, mourn, pyllamyd. nola, however is very original in its sound, and its timeless. i listened to this album ten years ago, and it has the same effect as today. it's a very special album, buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
006621131X|5.0|This book is a love story of epic proportions, with somewhat of a twist! Patti and Robert Maplethorpe? Who knew! (besides everyone who knew them personally...) The text is inspiring and reasuring about love, creative drive, friendship, caring, support, incredible fortune, God, magic, and unbearable misfortune! It also is a trip to the past; our paths had crossed many a time - the East Village, Max's Kansas City, the Fillmore East, Chelsea Hotel, Hong Fat, MET, WBAI, Washington Square, ect., we never met. (Coming from Nassau County, and being 9 years younger than Patti, it's pretty clear why we hadn't met. But I was 15 to 25 miles away from where most of this story took place, and walked the fabled grounds she and Robert had occupied. Thirty minutes on the LIRR, followed by a short walk from Penn Station. When I went to the Fillmore in 1971 a couple of times, I was only 15 years old.)  I always liked Patti Smith for her music and unique style. Now I LOVE her! After reading her memiors, I feel like we're old friends! And I have a far better appreciation and understanding about who Robert was, and what (else) he had been through, and accomplished. (I'll never view a B & W whithout thinking of him.)

0307454541|5.0|This was recommended to me by another bibliophile who loves a good yarn, great plot development and real characters. Its been awhile since I have had to tell myself, \\"enough, go to bed already\\", but somehow I always managed to read another chapter.<br />He sets out a great story line and in a different, exotic setting. For an American, the setting in Sweden developed a great sense of place and I didn't have anything else with which to compare. I found myself going to Google maps to get a better sense of where the plot was taking place.<br />I judge that  the pace is great without experiencing that sense that you are being rushed through plot development just so the character can do something 30 pages from now. Mr. Larsson has a great sense of plot development and continuously takes you to places in the story line you didn't think about ahead of time, but makes great sense when they happen. I am anxiously looking forward to reading books two and three.
B002C2XXJY|5.0|Demi's back, with more awesome songs. From the popular \\"Here We Go Again\\" and \\"So Far So Great\\" (Sonny With A Chance theme song), to the not-so-popular \\"Catch Me\\" and \\"U Got Nothin' On Me\\", Demi has hit us again with her wonderful voice and co-writing skills. :)<br /><br />I recommend both of Demi's CDs. She has an amazing voice, great co-writing skills, and doesn't need any voice-editing. She also hasn't done any inappropriate themes, so if you're looking for a singer that the younger ones will probably like, while having no bad meanings, choose Demi. :)

If you like depressing movies about pathetic, self-centered, losers who go through life inflicting pain on others and are unable to generate even a modicum of empathy for their fellow human beings then you'll love this flick...otherwise you'll do better just sitting in the closet for an hour and a half. WARNING: If you are at all suicidal don't watch this movie because it will surely push you over the edge. If this is the best that new-wave, independent art film makers can do then God help us all.
0312383436|5.0|I started to give this latest Wickham social comedy 4 stars.  It didn't make me cry.  It didn't make me laugh out loud.  And I probably won't ever wonder about \\"what that character would be up to now\\" the way I do with a couple of Madeline Wickham's (aka Sophie Kinsella) other creations.  It was a four star in the realm of Wickham's scintillating universe of outrageous characters and situations, but it was a five star in the realm of books in general, if what you are looking for is delightful fluff that rings true -- the best escapism possible.<br /><br />We meet Milly as a romantic and adventurous 18-year old who commits an impetuous act of friendship that will change her life; quickly the story brings us to contemporary times, as 28-year old Milly is preparing for her media-worthy marriage to Simon, a rich young man full of daddy issues.  I guess part of the reason I didn't *love* this book is because I never really sympathized much with our protagonist; nor did I much care for Simon who, by the end, I wasn't sure I *wanted* Milly to hook.  Wickham/Kinsella is always fun, but here I'd say she is missing the depth of insight that usually sets her above most writers.  As usual the author excels at drawing meaningful character profiles quickly, and then placing them rapidly into the worst couple of weeks of their lives -- one hopes!<br /><br />Fun read, but not the author's best.
0061876747|5.0|William Boyd is a literary craftsman whose skills keep the reader enthralled and informed from the first page to the last. He is the antidote to all the overpraised writers fawned over erroneously in the current publishing climate of `name' and `brand' because they lucked into (often undeserved) popularity. Boyd is the real thing: a writer.<br /><br />`Ordinary Thunderstorms' (the title reflects the way in which simple climatic phenomena can grow in complexity to major events) is brilliantly observed and meticulously written. No reader in the U.S. should stay away simply because it deals significantly with London and the Thames. It explains much that curious and intelligent readers want to know about any major world city, a stunning insider view that strips modern London to its truths.<br /><br />Boyd takes us into the times, places and events with unerring skill, drawing out the characters with exquisite detail of appearance, speech, environment, motivation and behavior. This is a thriller of extraordinary dimensions, and one can only hope it will be filmed, to provide (yet again) counterpoint to the mindless drivel that passes increasingly for movie entertainment these days.<br /><br />I will not reveal the plot. The suspense is excruciating, and who would deny a reader that pleasure? Suffice it to say that Boyd traces the life and transformation into other worlds and identities of a young British college professor, newly returned to the U.K. from the U.S., dragged unsuspecting into a murder for which he is considered guilty. As it evolves, the story encompasses a pharmaceutical-corporation deception of global intricacy, a murder-for-hire thug, a young black prostitute and her son, a revivalist mission, and the London police. Every character is memorable, every chapter turns the screw tighter, until the reader is caught up in the plot intricacies at ever-heightened levels of tension and anxiety. In this, Boyd shows his skills as a writer: it all fits, like the structure of a complex pharmaceutical molecule, and the necessary suspensions of disbelief are few and forgivable. This is entertainment at rarified levels of execution.<br /><br />Boyd does one other thing, and it is important. He never overwrites. He uses only the right amount of unaffected words and appropriate levels of detail to tell his story. In this (read some of my other reviews for amplification) he provides a model for other writers who apparently can't stop themselves from telling us too much, in too lengthy and repetitive forms, and who seem to be in love with the sound of their own voices. Boyd \\"tells it like it is\\" as directly as he can. He richly deserves all the praise that is heaped on him in the UK.maceutical molecule, and the necessary suspensions of disbelief are few and forgivable.

0385512058|4.0|As many people pointed out, the author loves to talk about himself. Sure, it gets a little old, but the book is still a good summary of dos and donts for networking, branding, personal interactions and paths to success, generally.<br /><br />A lot is borrowed here from other works, but I think there are also more recent books about branding that might have actually borrowed from this much more thorough tome. Never Eat Alone offers a solid and helpful summary about the aforementioned topics to someone generally unfamiliar with approaches that work. Though this book is not revolutionary, it could be useful to older people who developed bad habits from an earlier time and have misguided impressions about social networks and their purposes, generally. I can think of a few people I know who could use this book who fit this description. As I read some of the examples, I thought of these deliberately disconnected people, their relatively unsuccessful working and personal lives and everything clicked. Personal relationships are indeed critical. That said, there are parts of this book that might not apply to the average cop, plumber, fireman or factory worker. If you're in sales or marketing, the approach will be of much greater benefit. Low level salaried employees, particularly those working in government, might find themselves a bit left out and perhaps frustrated that so little of these techniques can be fully exploited. Think about it - did Donald Trump ever have a postman compete on The Apprentice?<br /><br />Also particularly useful was the \\"conference commando\\" chapters, which should be required reading for anyone who wants to get more out of the typical bad food, big table, conference filled with \\"network-jerks\\" and speakers you don't really care about.<br /><br />The author mentioned several examples of famous people (that of course he knows personally - ok, we get it already), including Bill Clinton, who is indeed extremely good at making the person he's talking to feel like the most important person in the room. The author credited Mr. Clinton not just with good techniques, but actual warm sincerity towards his personal relations. Not sure if he really believes that about Bill (you better put some ice on that) Clinton. More likely it was a strategically placed and somewhat enhanced name-drop. Lots of that in this book, including an inordinate number of Democrat politicians and activists, in spite of the author claiming to be a republican (though he now does not disclose his politics). He also mentions going to church, but that his passion is \\"spirituality\\" (is that faith? or religion? or meditation?). I couldn't care less what his views and religious preferences are, but these inconsistencies created a mildly insincere portrait - I hope I read that wrong.<br /><br />Overall this is an enjoyable and refreshing reminder about the importance of building and maintaining worthwhile personal and professional relationships.important person in the room.

B002VKE0XA|5.0|A married San Diego couple (Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat) have moved into a house in the suburbs. They think it could be a nice home to be in as it all seems pleasant at first, until something terrible is going on as they hear noises and see objects move. A mischevious spirit is tormenting our happy couple turning 16 nights into a living nightmare of epic preportions.<br /><br />Brilliant, truly scary and very psychlogical supernatural independent thriller from writer-director Oren Peli is one of the best horror movies of the new millenium. Here is the movie that became an unexpected box-office hit for three weeks in October of last year thus beating SAW VI's record, what works about this movie is that it doesn't go for self-parody like \\"Scream\\" or torture horror like \\"Hostel\\" as it harkens back to the days of supernatural movies like \\"The Haunting\\" or \\"Poltergeist\\". It's all done in the eyes of a handi-camera much like \\"Cannibal Holocaust\\", \\"REC\\" or the overrated \\"Blair Witch Project\\" all did but i think this one is superior to \\"Blair Witch\\" as it's more scary and more realistic. Yes the acting is bland but it's a b-movie you know and all b-movies have bad acting but the storyline is very good and this one makes it look like an actual report of a poltergeist instead of being a hollywood movie.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray contains two different versions like the extended unrated version with alternate ending and theatrical version with theatrical ending, you can even choose which ending to see and there's zero extras at all.
B000FJHEB4|1.0|HEADS UP, people!<br /><br />When my copy arrived it was PAL format - the EUROPEAN format - and it wouldn't play in my DVD player.<br /><br />After checking the product description - it says NTSC - I returned the item at NO CHARGE and my money was promptly refunded by the seller, but I wouldn't have ordered it in the first place if I knew it was an OUT OF REGION format.<br /><br />Some new players out there will now have no problem reading these discs in PAL format, but you'd better check your player's specs before ordering.
B001993Y2C|3.0|Presumably if you're going to spend this much money for a TV show, you've seen all or most of it already and you know that the show is well-written and directed with very real, three-dimensional characters.  So I will refrain from reviewing the show except to say that it is well worth a watch.    I wrote this review to warn you about the packaging:  it's horrible.  The actual box is 22 cm tall and ~19 cm wide on each side.  That means that it will almost definitely not fit in your video shelf at home.  In order to remove the discs, you will probably need both hands to lift the gargantuan top half of the box up.  You can do it with one hand, but you will be uncomfortable.    Once you open one of the four disc boxes for the first time, don't be surprised if the internal packaging is slightly damaged.  This is because the boxes are made from thin paperboard packaging -- thinner stock than a box of cereal.  It's sad to think that a box of cereal is designed to be used perhaps a dozen times before being discarded whereas DVD/blu-ray boxes should theoretically last a lifetime.  Out of the four boxes in my packaging, only one was pristine.  The other three had crease marks in their sleeves, indicating folding at some prior point.    With the sleeve system, removing a disc without touching the data surface is very difficult unless you turn the entire box upside-down and hold the other discs in the box in place.  If this sounds awkward to you, well...you're right.  Note that if you hold the box upside-down when closed, the discs will slide around inside though not fall out of their sleeves, but I would still not recommend doing it.    Another reviewer pointed out that there is no table of contents telling you which episodes are on which disc, nor is there a list where you can find special features.  If you want to watch a specific episode in the middle of a season, gods help you.  (By the way, on the topic of special features, I will say that there is a commentary track fornearly every episode.  Cool!)    Oh, and I really don't care about the Cylon action figure on the top of the box, either.    The packaging is a clear case of trying too hard.  The only thing they would've had to do to impress me would be to present it in a colorful box with the corners cut out of it, put each season into its own box and list the episodes and special features on the back.    Here's what I recommend:  if you can, spend more money and buy the entire series season-by-season.  Unfortunately, as of this writing, some seasons aren't available on blu-ray on Amazon.com.  Hopefully these lists, below, will help you assemble your collection without this packaging abomination (note that neither \\"The Plan\\" nor \\"Caprica\\" are in the \\"Complete Series\\" collection, so I didn't list them below).

1401307450|5.0|I am 23 year old musician/artist, and am acctually only to the 4th chapter and can not put this book down, this book takes a new edge on the realazation of someones (A. kiedis), non stop action, soul searched, influenced by the rare extremes of childhood to adulthood life unlike any other. Well written and explained. its no wonder someone like him ended up famous with such a drive to do exactly what he wanted too and made it to the top, an awesome book if you dont like there music but if you do like the music and should, it brings a whole new meaning and prespective on the message, jouney and feelings A. kiedis had gone through along with the rest of the band. most interesting book i have ever read. BUY IT!
B001U887OW|5.0|These crocs are the greatest thing since sliced bread!  I wear them all of the time (and I live in Cleveland).  I have walked in them through snow, and have not had wet feet.  My feet hurt in every pair of shoes I wear, except for crocs.  I might just buy a pair in every color!
0316154687|5.0|Loved this book - absolutely priceless!<br /><br />The other parents at my son's Tae Kwan Do studio still look at me funny.... (\\"There's that woman who sits in the corner reading and bursts into laughter every few minutes...\\").<br /><br />Ah.  Little do they know the wonderful reason...<br /><br />This book and \\"Naked\\" are the only two Sedaris books I've read thusfar; looking forward to reading all of his books.<br />Sedaris is quite gifted at mining humor from the dry and mundane \\"everyday\\" happenings of life.<br />(I'm quite sure I'll never forget Mrs. Peacock, her \\"margarine hair\\" or her forced back scratches.  (Gives me the willies just thinking about it...!)
0064407667|4.0|This is the first time we hear the unfortunate story of the Baudelaire orphans.  Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are devastated at the death of both of their parents in a tragic fire.  Their family had been quite wealthy and although the children were not spoiled, they enjoyed a comfortable and happy lifestyle.  Mr. Poe, a banker and friend of the late Mr. and Mrs. Baudeliare, is in charge of seeing that thier will is carried out and their inheritance is guarded until Violet turns 18.  Part of their will included that the children will be sent to live with relatives.  As if the loss of their parents wasn't enough, their nearest relative turns out to be Count Olaf, a man they do not trust as soon as they set their eyes on him.<br /><br />They soon find out that Count Olaf is as dangerous as they first suspected.  He is after one thing, their inheritance, and he will do anything to get it.<br /><br />He treats the three Baudelaire's like servants.  They share one dusty room with one sad excuse for a mattress.  They must cook and clean for him and his troop of actors.<br /><br />He hatches an evil scheme to `trick' Violet into marrying him so he can get to their inheritance.  He orders Violet to act as the bride in the play and convinces his neighbor, a Judge, to act as...a judge.  Violet refuses, but Count Olaf has Sunny, the youngest Baudelaire, strung up in a cage by one of his evil gang.<br /><br />The children manage to get out of this sticky situation and uncover Count Olaf's plan.  Mr. Poe finally realizes that the complaints the children have been making are true.  The story leaves us waiting for the next 'series of unfortunate events' that will occur to the children.<br /><br />Both my girls LOVED this book and immediately wanted to go back to the library and check out book #2.  Although this book could have been read alone by a 2nd or 3rd grader, we chose the series as a read-aloud.<br /><br />~Jenn
B002VWONB2|5.0|In earlier days when I had this movie on VHS I didn't think it was all great. But then about 5 years ago I got the 2 disc S.E Casablanca on DVD and really enjoyed it.  And I realized why about 15 minutes into the movie; I could hear every single word clearly for the first time.  And for a movie like this, it's an absolute necessity.  You know how it is - if you can't keep up to speed with the movie you don't get the most out of it.  I think this movie does deserve 5 stars, even though this rating is thrown around somewhat carelessly here in all the reviews
0446698342|4.0|I did it!  I read a Nicolas Sparks book.  Even more amazing, I actually liked it.  I'm not a romance/love story type person.  I have to say, watching The Notebook as a movie, totally turned me off of the books.  Too sappy, too sweet.<br /><br />This book was a bit sappy and sweet, but I have to say I found the characters had a lot of depth to them.  I guess because my expectations were VERY low, it seemed fantastic.<br /><br />I enjoyed the twisted relationships between the characters, both living and dead.  I was plesantly surprised and glad I picked up this book.<br /><br />This one is worth a read, and I will definately read another of his books.<br /><br />~Jenn<br /><br />Topic: A young marine finds a photograph of a woman on the beach while on a tour of duty in Iraq.  He decides to keep the photograph and it seems to bring him luck.  He survives where he shouldn't on several occasions.

B002TYZKIM|4.0|Now that Michael is gone, these clips from the show that never was are precious.  The music and dancing are great, and some of the scenes are spectacular, but you're essentially watching a rehearsal.  In several places Michael acknowledges that he's saving his voice, so the power you would see in a real show is not quite there.      However, what is really compelling about this movie is the way it lets you inside Michael's world and into his heart.  You see Michael in odd moments when he is just being himself, and you see what a phenomenal person he was.  He does everything in love.  He never loses his temper.  He's down to earth and exceedingly humble.  He is always thinking about others.  Multiple times, he says, \\"God bless you\\" to various people.  It is the insight into Michael that I will always remember about this DVD.    The special features are a treasure too.  One of them is all about the costumes that Michael would have worn had the show come about, and they are completely amazing--a show all in themselves.  Another is about memories of Michael, and there again are tender moments and little glimpses of Michael.    Michael got what love is all about, and he incorporated it not only into his work but into every moment of his life.  He was a living legend and a living epitome of unconditional love.  He will always occupy a place of honor in my heart for who he was.  Michael was an extremely hard worker and a perfectionist, because he was creating a gift of love to give to his fans.  He was generous, caring, and iconic in his humanity.  My hat is off to Michael, and I'm inspired by his example of love and humility.  Love really does last forever.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I am a new fan of Taylor Swift, and love this CD.  My teens and their friends love her so I bought this to hear the entire CD.  Very easy to listen to, and nice for a parent not to hear X-rated trashy lyrics from a very popular young singer.  The song \\"Fifteen\\" hits the kids right between the eyes where they are at in their young lives, and it makes an adult remember the painful/exhuberant/rollercoaster days of being a teen.  Eight thumbs up from our house!
B001RCD2DW|4.0|I've had these for a few months now, long enough to realize they're pretty good. Pros for me are crystal clear sound and incredible detail. One con is that there isn't enough bass. I'd suggest getting an external amp, which really made these sound better.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I find it hilarious that you have the option to turn her voice off and just work out to the music and follow her movement.  Her comments do get old after the first 2 weeks, but I would rather just turn the sound off completely and listen to my ipod.  I discovered this dvd on cable on demand.  She has a whole channel with her workouts.  This one I found the best due to it getting results in such a little amount of time.    I followed a diet based on a book called \\"Eat to Live\\" by Dr. Fuller.  I lost 30 pound without exercising.  Now that I lost weight, I wanted to build some muscle! I already notice a big difference in only 2 weeks!  I highly recommend this.    I mix this workout with a 5 minute workout on cable demand called \\"armed and dangerous.\\"  This allows me to help sculpt my arms faster than the dvd would do.
B00064WSNW|5.0|Yes it must have seemed the way...my review title implies when Robert Fripp suddenly put King Crimson together from the ashes after having broken up in the middle of the previous decade. Fact of the matter is though this was not the same band. King Crimson were one of the earliest progressive rock groups,right there with Genesis and Yes actually. Now the game had changed a lot. Being progressive in music was no longer a short hand term for throwing European classical and modern electronic music styles into long rock songs basically. Now with groups such as The Clash with their [[ASIN:B00004BZ16 Sandinista!]] and Talking Heads with [[ASIN:B000002KO3 Remain in Light]] what was defined as \\"progressive\\" in rock was changing radically and the ideas of communal-oriented percussion,drumming and other polyrhythmic effects. And luckily Talking Heads' own Adrian Belew joined the band around this time with all of those concepts fresh in his musical heart,mind and more. The music on this embraces the same polyrhythmic style Afro-funk that the Heads did but Robert Fripp's twist is added for good measure to great a hyper extended version of that sound. \\"Elephant Talk\\" as a matter of fact puts the groove into overdrive with Fripp and Belew's brilliant reverbed guitars with other sound effects weaving in and around it for a potent hybrid. Likewise any differences with rhythm and beat fade into the mix on \\"Matte Kudasal\\",\\"Thelma Hun Ginjeet\\" and the title song where often times Belew's David Byrne-like vocals create a certain type of atmosphere:in this case more one of paradox as opposed to paranoia. \\"Frame By Frame\\" and \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" are actually beautiful,spacious ballad type grooves that retain a vital avante garde jazz-funk type flavor. \\"Indiscipline\\" is by far the hardest edged song to be heard here-with it's loud dissonant guitars there's some extentions on what people like Jimi Hendrix baught to the funk-rock hybrid. As with Miles Davis's similarly conceptualized album [[ASIN:B00004VWAF On the Corner]] the music on this album actually doesn't have a label but one could call it funk,jazz-funk or funk-rock if you wanted. But the word funk would definately have to be there not only because of Belew's inspirations musically but because of the types of rhythms used to construct these songs around. There's a lot of this type of musical inspiration to be found in many types of music during this time so this is one of those slightly exotic treaures for sure.arly conceptualized album [[ASIN:B00004VWAF On the Corner]] the music on this album actually doesn't have a label but one could call it funk,jazz-funk or funk-rock if you wanted.

If you don't like to read, get the CD version and listen to it, but for pete's sake get this info into your head!  But it is the best thing I've ever read to just turn the lights on and allow a business owner to see how running a business works.  The idea of If I Build It, They Will Come is total hooey.  Too many business owners pour their heart and soul into the best shop, best service, best logo, and wonder where the customers are.  This book shows how you have to be working on the business and in the business, finding the work and then doing the work.  Reading this book saves you thousands of dollars in bad advertising mistakes and thousands of hours of frustrations.  Buy it now; read it immediately; thank me later.

0385341008|5.0|One of my greatest pleasures has always been reading. What a pleasure it was to read a book about regular people who loved to share in the joy of reading. I read so many books and have opinions of them all. But never have I been inspired to write a review of any sort, until now. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is an incredible read. Never have I read a book so chalk pack with amazing characters. I laughed out loud so many times while reading this book. Also, I am by no means a \\"cryer\\" but on more than one occassion I could not hold back the tears.<br />  The character of Elizabeth reminds us that our greatest cache is the love we bring to others. I am inspired to meet my neighbors. If only neighbors were inclined to meet each other in this day and age. Perhaps we should aspire to get back to the days when everyone at least knew the first name of everyone on their street, even if it is just in passing.<br />  Even though this book is in the form of letters and journal entries it does not detract from the wonderfully tragic yet inspiring story. I wish for everyone to read this book and know what it is to love thy neighbor. I was reminded of the story of Forrest Gump and how one person has the power to affect many. I heard this book is in the development stages of being made into a movie. So if they make this a movie I hope they do it with respect and love toward the history and the people of Guernsey.
B00005JMX6|3.0|Nice movie but I liked it the first time when it was called \\"Risky Business\\".
0385504225|3.0|My 8 year old asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I wasted no time in saying The Lost Symbol - I loved both the Da Vinci Code and Angel and Demons movies(never read the books) and really looked forward to reading this book and introducing myself to Dan Brown's writing. The book gripped me in the begining - I fell asleep in the middle- and said WTF at the end.    I think everyone before pointed out the obvious flaws in this novel but I am really trying to understand what in God's name I read and it took me a while because I have two young ones. I feel as though someone has played a bad joke on me and I got a dummy copy. This could not be the real book.    Yes it has a few twist and turns but why is the brilliant Robert Langdon so dumbed down in this book? He is supposed to be the hero yet I felt as thought every other character carried him along the over 500 pages. Tom Hanks will never reprise in role for this crap.    And the never ending preaching..........the last few chapters after \\"the big revelation\\" were torture to get through - was this part really necessary - it was like a bad Sunday surmon.    I am a life long Catholic and have always questioned certain things in the bible but while reading this novel he had me wondering what exactly he was trying to prove or disprove - what was the point. I knew from looking at the DVC and A&D that there were strong religious links but I think he went overboard with this one - The bible- \\"the hidden word\\"- are you kidding me?    I have to say that I did like Mal'akh - he was the only interesting character in this book. He was so messed up you could not help but pitty him. Another thing how was Peter Solomon able to go on a field trip with Robert after being tortured and getting his hand chopped off..........did I miss something?    I think my expectations were too high and now I'm sorely disappointed- but my kids will never know 8)
2839905809|5.0|What have I learned from this book?  Among other insights, I've learned how to create and discover new ideas and how to improve or innovate a business. The authors and creative team have put together an excellent book, one that changed my viewpoint about business after I read through all the topics. Now I have the glasses of business model canvases on, and seeing through them, I assess startups, companies, sport clubs, government institutions, etc. all from a perspective quite different from the one I used to have. I also used what I acquired from this book to create new business models. In addition, It helped me practice with prototypes for business models and with business model combining. I recommend this excellent book to everyone interested in the subject. It will definitely change the way a reader regards businesses and business models.

I would suggest this to any Alan Moore fan and anarchist. Though it is funny that Guy Fawkes was chosen considering that the general opinion of Guy Fawkes in Britain is not a friendly one.

B000TTRGUE|5.0|It's obvious that the XM8500's design and marketing place it in direct competition with the Shure SM58,  a mic which sets the world standard for live performance.  The audacity! The good news is that the XM8500 is actually a very less expensive alternative to the pricier SM58. If you were feeling around in the dark you might grab the XM8500, mistaking it's heavyweight, rugged construction and steel mesh grille for the SM58. If you were still in the dark and plugged in, you still might mistake the XM8500 for the SM58. Of course there are differences, but not in quality, and the best difference is the price. I haven't dropped it yet, but if I do, it won't ruin my day because it's easier to watch one twenty dollar bill fly out the window than five twenty dollar bills.
0142001104|5.0|Very inspirational, with lots of helpful \\"practices.\\" Funny and sincere. Great help in transforming your point of view, if you feel stuck (or if you feel the others are stuck). I'd like to respond to the reviewers who criticized this book for being too facile or slick or old news: if you read a lot of self-help books then maybe you already know most of this stuff, but here it's presented from an unexpected perspective, with lots of uplifting, real-life examples. There really aren't many different things that can help you become less neurotic and you probably already know that; the point is to find an approach that will speak to you best. For me it was this book. Thank you very much Mrs. and Mr. Zander! I feel like I literally lifted a heavy burden off my back, the burden being my \\"downward spiral\\" attitude and a good dose of Revenge Creature, too. I know I will use practices from this book over and over.

0439023483|3.0|Disturbing storyline, done in a tasteful, fairly non-violent, page turning way. It is a cross between The Truman Show, Survivor, Mad Max and Margaret Haddix's The Shadow Children series. Wierd, I know- but it works. Middle school girls who like fantasy will be hooked. I didn't think I'd like it when I heard the premise, but as a bookseller who has seen it flying off the shelves, I had to read it, and wasn't disappointed. If you liked this, read Margaret Haddix's \\"Running Out of Time\\" and Shadow Children series.
0446567337|5.0|Being a military spouse and also being an army brat my entire life, I can see this story unfolding as it did and found it beautiful and breathtaking. This was my first nicholas sparks novel, but of course I have seen all the movies. I wasn't expecting tears, but this book moved me to that point. John and Savannah's love is so deep even though it developed in a short amount of time. When you know that there is a possibility that you might not see someone again, the love you feel is hard and I know that first hand. I understand her decision to marry, but I also felt heart wrenched for John...he'll in a sense always be waiting. I do applaud his decision in the end even though it was his decision that brought the tears to my eyes. This book is a great one and i recommend it to the hopeless romantics out there like me.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|this series is awesome. way better than harry potter. i cant wait for The City of Falling Angels to come out. these books are suspenseful and great. its so great that i couldnt put the book down until i finished reading. i would reccomend this book to everyone, even the people who hate reading. once you read this book you will love to read and keep on reading this series over and over again. cassandra clare is a great author.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie \\"should\\" be a must see for anyone who eats food.  I have been a careful consumer in regards to food for about 7 years now and was horrified to see where our food really comes from.<br /><br />This movie would have also been so dreadfully depressing if it wasn't for farmer Joel Saladin, he was the ray of sunlight, the breath of fresh air,  the glimmer of hope and with a lot of pressure from consumers the way farming will be done in the future. Though it was hard to watch the killing floors of the pigs, the exploitation of non-documented workers at meat plants, the raping of the American farmers and the utter disdain for life, this movie will make you aware of what is really happening.
B00069FLC2|5.0|Like many young boys growing up in the mid 1960 era, Hank Marvin was my guitar hero.  Almost fifty years later, he still is as well as for some heavy weight guitar players.  The DVD is a great production and features the main trio - Hank Marvin, Bruce Welch and Brian Bennett - very equitably.  The tunes (and songs) are executed perfectly.  Yes, they are seasoned professionals but remembering 41 numbers with such accuracy and passion is amazing.  All the big hits are there as well as some outings from Marvin, Welch and Farrar and some of their own interpretations of other composers' work.  It's so difficult to pick a favourite but for me, it's a non-Shads tune; I think they played the perfect 'Equinoxe' which is just before the interval.    The video is well balanced and thankfully wasn't recorded using all sorts of unwelcome effects by up and coming directors; I felt the result was as good a record of what it would have been like to be there and I saw what I wanted to see - The Shadows.  The audio is excellent.    But why, oh why is this not available in Blu-ray??    After watching this DVD I did the decent thing and at the age of 54, finally bought a Fender Stratocaster.  And jolly nice it looks in my lounge too.
B001JAFYFG|4.0|If you are looking at buying \\"Logan's Run\\" you already know the movie. I must say it shows some weakness in style, but that is because I have become spoiled with the new special effects. Still, the ideas in the movie about youth and age, ecology, and a potential future for mankind is still provocative. Now as to the blu-ray transfer, I give that a 3 star rating. Maybe they did not have great source material, but there were many instances of heavy grain, primarily in darker scenes. Still, if you want this film, buy the blu-ray, it is better than the old dvd.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Not much to say other than \\"Buy this DVD!\\".  Every episode is amazing, and the picture quality is beyond belief
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Amazing Movie, great action, great actors, one of the best movies of the year.  The blu-Ray version is awesome and has some really nice extras.
630469654X|5.0|Love the storyline and all the characters.  Matthew Broderick and Rutger Hauer are my favorite actors.  I wish it would come out in Blu-Ray.  It's a must have in any collection.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series is absolutely awesome if you enjoy war movies.  You get an idea of what our soldiers endured during world was II.  The characters are wonderful and the story seems true to life.  Highly recommended.
B000063UR2|3.0|This is not Tom Cruise finest work.  If you like fantasy movies then it's worth your time and money, otherwise save your money.  I gave it 3 stars because of the superb acting from Tim Curry the Devil.  Really like the Devil's character.
B000ZJW4NW|4.0|This was the first opportunity I had to watch the Tudors series. I really enjoyed it. This was a very good product. It was in excellent condition when I received it and I received it promptly. I liked how the seller told me exactly what the product was and in what condition I should expect to receive it in.
0307454541|2.0|Well, I'm not certain why so many people liked this book.  I suppose there was a certain amount of mystery to it, but overall there was too much time spent on geneologies (some of which were irrelevent), and so much of the book was based on Swedish culture that if you are not an insider you'll miss out on too much.  Most importantly, the book had far too much rape, grotesque sexual abuse, and violence.  When the mystery finally comes together, it's just not that satisfying or likely.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I'm very happy with this purchase. I did not only bought it because it was really cheap compared to what other stores offer for this kind of cable, but the quality of video and sound is great. Thanks to Amazon  for this product
B001P9KR8U|5.0|An excellent movie about the hard/horrible experiences some feel in India. All true true true... I was there.. this country needs a lot of help... its sad how so many of us ignore things like that.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This has been one of the best seasons of the series. I totally recommend it. Moreover, thanks to Amazon because the packing and delivery was great. I love buying the products directly from them, they haven't dissapoint me yet.
B002KR7NTC|5.0|A great dvd in french,that keeps you laughing from beginning till end.  Many famous actors play in this dvd.
B002L9N4F6|5.0|For those of you who are wondering whether to get the regular blu ray or the chocolate box set, got with the regular. The chocolate box set offers nothing, its cluttered, and has no chocolates! The blu ray from what i understand is also an outdated version so I was disappointed with this version of the product. Get this movie but stay away from the chocolate box set, totally lame and useless.
0143116177|5.0|Mr. Ferguson has undertaken to tackle some pretty weighty subjects and yet made them thoroughly interesting and easy to understand. He is a joy to read as his writing is clear, precise and informative - all at same time. I recommend him to one and all!
0061703257|4.0|The movie trailers make this look like a horror story and it's not... a psychological suspense thriller, yes.  Horror, no.  And this highly entertaining book has been expertly adapted for the screen.  But if you're a reader (which you obviously are, since you're here on amazon reading these reviews), I certainly recommend reading the book before you see the film.  It won't detract from your enjoyment of the latter and author Lehane does a great job of creating a solid story with a colorful cast of characters.  I read it in one sitting...definitely a page turner.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This movie is fantastic, I'm a Star Trek fan so I knew I would like it regardless; but this movie is indeed a good one.
B0026P3G12|4.0|A wonderful success story of sorts, with a beautiful voice to cap it off.  I enjoy listening to this \\"underdog\\" who lost the contest, but went on to prove that she had what it took to succeed.  I can only hope that she'll not give up and continue to please her fans with her lovely voice.
0380730405|5.0|Daphne du Maurier is one of the best novelists of our time and Rebecca is one of the best suspense novels of our era.  This enthralling novel encompasses the very best of romantic suspense and murder mystery.  The author succinctly shows us how perception and reality can be perceived as polar opposites and the consequences of misconstrued assumptions about others can lead to estrangement and confusion.<br /><br />Rebecca is the deceased, first Mrs. de Winter and when our narrator, the second Mrs. de Winter, arrives at Manderly she is bombarded with a house enshrined to the memories of the first Mrs. De Winter who, by all appearances, was the perfect wife and socialite - beautiful, intelligent.  Her untimely death was a terrible shock to Manderly and the people who knew her. The second Mrs. De Winter feels she will never fit in but before long she realizes that all is not what meets the eye.<br /><br />The key players, from the brooding Maxim de Winter, the sinister Mrs. Danvers, the beautiful Rebecca, our story's narrator, and de Winter's haunting estate, Manderly, are so real and come alive as characters.  The story is very intense and sets a hypnotic, haunting mood and keeps you turning the pages from the enticing beginning to the surprising end.<br /><br />This novel has it all, murder, mystery, romance, and suspense and it is one of the best love stories ever written.  Ms. du Maurier has written one of the finest gothic suspense novels of our time.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This is an outstanding show - I'd been looking forward to it for some time.    I had no problems with the vendor.
B002N8A14M|5.0|Got this to protect my new IPOD.  Unlike a number of other sleeves this one protects the screen without having to \\"stick\\" something on.  The clip allows quick attachment and I'm glad it's an integrated part of the sleeve as I use it all the time.       When the armband is used the sleeve sits just off the arm when clipped in place, so the IPOD is protected from sweat. Even when running it stays in place, is extremely comfortable and doesn't bind.  Highly recommend!!!

B002UD56I6|5.0|MJ's personal foibles aside, this is by far the best show/Blu-Ray I've ever seen and most of all, heard.  The sound in DTS is fabulous!  I thought it may sound kinda like a home movie since it was not intended to be released.  However, my sound system never put out better sound.  And I like almost any kind of music.  I have to say that MJ was one of the best singer/dancers/songwriters/entertainers I've ever seen...and I'm 61YO!  He inspires a group of musicians, singers and dancers to levels they never thought possible.  It's a shame this show never made it to the stage as it would've been the best in history.  If you even think you like MJ's music and have a decent DTS system, get this disc!  You won't be sorry.  2/1/10 After multiple views, I realize that he was a big-time prima donna.  Most geniuses are.  You can call the director's responses a$$ kissing.  BUT, did you notice when MJ changed something, it sounded much better?  He was right.  My only problem is the eco-song with the little girl in a film.  The song has a beautiful, haunting albeit repetitive tune.  But I am very disappointed that he was trying to convince us that in four years, earth will literally be a smoldering ruin because of mankind and shows the little girl in the middle of it.  Way over the top.  Still...what a concert that would've been.   He didn't seem all drugged out as the media would have had us believe at his death.  I don't know how he did all those rehearsals and be so seemingly energetic (for a 50YO), coherent and notice small details he wanted changed.  P.S. That tiny blonde Aussie female guitarist kicked some serious a$$ and looked gorgeous while doing so.  Heard MJ found her on YouTube.  I hope to see her again.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Awesome product. You hear parts you could never hear before....I'm not sure that's how the Beatles wanted it, but it is a must for any Beatles fan.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Was very pleased with range of selections and of course, Susan's choice of style to express these.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Ok, I was totally ready not to like this movie. As a matter of fact, the previews didnt even interest me all that much. I only saw it because everybody I knew gave it rave reviews and so I thought why not? I'll give it a shot. I absolutely loved it! The special effects are awesome, images breathtaking and it had a wonderful storyline. It was so interesting I could barely look away. This is definately a must see. I am definately buying the DVD as soon as it comes out. I was wondering what all the hype was about and why this movie won so many awards. Now I know. Absolutley wonderful movie!
0767020308|4.0|Enjoyable version of Austen's Emma with an authentic English cast. Mark Strong is the definitive Mr. Knightley in my heart.
B001PPGAJE|5.0|X Men succesfully balances the comics with reality, example having a starandized uniform for the X Men instead of everyone having their own unique spandex suit.The X Men have basicly made themselves into a mutant anti-terrorism group as a devision of the Xaviar institute, which works with the goverment for equality and excaptance of mutants.    In this movie their are three powers at work, mutants that try to convince normal humans that mutants are no better or worse than normal humans and want to be completely intergrated into society without any fear, mutants that have suffered because of fear that they cause normal and normal humans in thet middle trying to decide if all mutants should be treated as threats or if they're like any other devision of humanity.      Argueably the most popular charactor in the X Men comics is Wolverine, who is the main charactor in all four movies so far. In this movie, he trys to decide if he needs to choose a side at all.
B002TZS5GU|2.0|I am glad I have never purchased this dog. The acting is fair but the movie is slow and never caught my attention. The death of one of the main characters was pretty bad. I rented this through Red Box and felt the $1 price was a waste.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|Heath Ledger's best role ever.  Very dark and sinister.  Would not recommend this for young children.  Christian Bale plays a great Batman.  Keep them coming.
0307576736|2.0|I usually like Alice Munro, but this disappointed.  The stories were rather bleak.  Life goes on, even though your brother/son was executed yesterday for crimes that he committed.  The title did not fit the stories.
B0000031P7|5.0|Keith Jarrett and his BELONGING band give classic 70's jazz a kick!!! Countless radio and tv show theme music and a nostalgic trip back to when jazz was part of cultural venacular.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show will go down as one of the greats. First, the cast (all of them) are fantastic character actors. Jim Parsons gets a lot of attention (rightfully so) for his Jim Carrey-esque use of body humor, but each actor is deserving of attention.    Second, the writing on this show is phenomenal. It is hilarious without being silly, and incorporates scientific and geek references fluently.    Which episode will we watch tonight? Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock to decide!
B001DDBCUA|3.0|I had rarely seen the TV show but I enjoyed this movie! You don't need to be a show follower to watch this movie, although I'm sure it helps.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great job of \\"putting all the pieces\\" together.  Even those that missed the original series or have turned their noses up at Kirk will appreciate how this ties it all together.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I listen in amazement at the range and depth of emotion in Susan Boyle's singing.  She touches a special nerve in me and I feel her message.
B000046PVN|5.0|I've owned the original LP release of the \\"Superman\\" soundtrack, ever since the movie was in theaters way back when.  In fact, it's one of the first two records I ever bought (and since I wasn't very wealthy at the time, I babied the thing... so it's literally still in \\"like new\\" condition!)<br /><br />When DVDs first came out, and I picked up the Superman DVD, I suddenly realized that what I'd been listening to over the years (on my metal-tape dub of the LP) wasn't exactly what was on-screen. It sort of made me go \\"Hmmmmm....\\"<br /><br />I love the original LP, but it's not the original movie soundtrack.  That's all I could conclude.  Presumably, Williams re-recorded it specifically for the LP.<br /><br />SO...  now, I own the actual movie soundtrack.  Yep, this is what I hear on the DVD.  And pretty much EVERYTHING I hear on the DVD (though I'm sure a cue here or there is left out, I haven't noticed any).<br /><br />Of course, the sound quality isn't EXACTLY like being in the studio.  There are some background noise and recording noise elements that can be picked up... BARELY...  if you're really, really immersed and have one heck of a sound system (which, now that I'm a lot more well-off than I was growing up, I can happily say I've got!).  The thing is...  anyone who expects a pure digital recording on something which was recorded in the 1970s is a loon.  OF COURSE there are some minimal noise elements... but they are, quite literally, as \\"minimal\\" as they possibly could be.<br /><br />I'm thrilled by this.  I still have the original (now dubbed to a high-quality rip on my HTPC) alongside this one.  Both are wonderful...  but this one is the DEFINITIVE version.<br /><br />It's like listing to a studio recording, and a \\"live concert\\" recording, of the same album.  Different experiences which, together, make up the \\"total experience.\\"
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The best book in the series. I started reading this book believing that the story was going to go one way and it went in a totally different  direction .  I read the complete book in 2 1\2 days.  Great way to end the series.

B000089J0R|3.0|I liked this debut album from dragonforce, it is better than their later album ultra beat down which was a terrible clone of inhuman rampage. But I know DF usually does the same 100 MPH melodic speed metal with 10 minute hyper sonic solos but this album was not really that bad at all.<br />The first song valley of the damned kinda sounds like future world from helloweens keeper albums and ZP Theart sings a little like michael kiske (ex helloween) but he mostly sings like chris bay (freedom call) too. And some of the rest of the songs sound like freedom call in a sonic hyper version with wonderful anthems too, and one of their songs I was kinda surprised they played accoustics lightly calm considering they always go kinda speedy.<br />Dragonforce is usually not a 5 star band to me due to the fact that they are a very repetitive power metal band + they don't establish their own sound exept their a sonic fast band of course. They are usually a cheap imitation of much better power metal bands out there, But I gave this album a chance and I liked it so I rate this album 3 stars which is not bad at all for this band and album.<br /><br />Overall good album not great but if your new to DF then this is one of the best places to start and the sonic firestorm album too.<br /><br />\m/ stay metal!
B001FB4VZS|4.0|Season 8 of Smallville is not the strongest of the series, but it is certainly not the weakest. It takes a few episodes to gain its footing before delivering some really good, entertaining episodes, but unfortunately it falls on its face a lot too. I'm not sure what the writers were thinking when they reintroduce old characters that should stay gone, but they like to beat a dead horse with the whole Romeo/Juliet love story. Smallville, unfortunately falls under the failure spell of almost all TV dramas, meaning that it refuses to let characters be happy and therefore has a tendency to let viewers down.<br /><br />Look forward to seeing more DC characters share the screen and watching another villain storyline develop.<br /><br />I'm sorry if this review seems vague, I'm trying not to give anything away.

It's a serious survival, off the trail, camping knife that will last a life time. You can sharpen this knife to no end! A great knife that hold it's own with other serious survival knives with a better price too!    Brad
0446580945|4.0|Good, clean, love story with some deep, thought-provoking issues. Easy read. I could not put it down.
B002W6Z0UK|1.0|I bought this not knowing much about the artist called \\"Lady GaGa\\". The CD has one song on it that could be called good. The rest run between fair to just plain bad. Unless you read the lyrics on the sleeve you won't understand the words on a few of the songs. These are simple \\"Dance Tunes\\" without much credibility. While at times she shows a hint at having an impressive vocal range it isn't often heard on this album. Some of the lyrics are raw and degrading of women. Not something I would want my children listening to. I looked into Ms GaGa's bio and after reading her public admissions of bisexuality and her intent to bring the homosexual agenda into the mainstream, (coupled with some pretty raunchy videos) I decided that as a Christian houshold I didn't want this influence effecting my children. It is hard enough to raise children with some level of morality in todays society with the liberal media and schools, I don't need to import that trash into our home. On a more positive note the CD made a beautiful 10 yard flight right into the dumpster.  So, for that aspect I gave the CD a rating of one star. Otherwise, \\"0\\".......
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|This is the kind of film that you must have if you like the ideas that contradict your mind's paradigms.
B0026P3G12|3.0|A bit disappointed because of the selections Susan Bolye chose. It wasn't varried enough and the last song SILENT NIGHT could have been deleted. Her voice is beautiful, but I would have liked less choir pieces.[[ASIN:B0026P3G12 I Dreamed A Dream]]
B000FJXQUC|5.0|This is among my favorite movies of all time.  All of the actors were outstanding.  Mr. Wayne, Yvonne deCarlo, Maureen O'Hara, and the entire support cast were great. I enjoy watching a teen-aged Stephanie Powers and a young Jerry Van Dyke singing a duet.  The conversation between John Wayne and Stephanie Powers about her inheritance gives me chills.  He still loves his wife and wants his daughter to have the type of love that her parents experienced.  Stephanie's character's affection for her father is also genuine. There is a lot of passion in this movie.  I liked how John Wayne supported the Native Americans.  He was allowed to give them as much respect as possible as accepted during the time period of this movie and when the movie was made.  Clearly, this was a fun movie to make and everyone looked like they were having a good time. Their enthusiam and commaraderie comes across in the movie.  The color is vibrant.  Thank you Amazon for making movies of this type available to us.
B000HOMU98|5.0|Great movie.  Being a former jarhead myself, the boot camp scenes were uncannily realistic.
0060007737|2.0|I was disappointed that the book is simply the author's view of the world, with no facts or back-up research.  As has been illustrated by other popular authors (Malcolm Gladwell's books as well as Levitt and Dubner's Freakonomics), just because something seems intuitive, doesn't mean it works.  Ries & Ries use examples to support their theories, but unfortunately what was popular at the time of the book's publishing (2002), didn't continue for some of the companies.  For example, they state \\"expanding your brand will diminish your power\\" and use GM as an example (which is a good one).  But what about Apple's expansion from computers into the iPod and iPhone?  They use Starbucks and Toys R Us as examples of brands that are well served by \\"keeping a narrow focus\\" and yet Starbucks has stumbled badly and Toys R Us had to sell itself to a group of investors in 2005 due to competition from Wal-Mart (which doesn't \\"keep a narrow focus\\").  This book could be good to stimulate ideas but don't look for any of the author's theories to be backed up with evidence proving they actually help to make the business better.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I have been a Michael fan for most of my life. I   have to admit that I started listening to more of  his music after his death. In doing so I discovered  that Michael was an artist with music that evolved  throughout his career. This is a very entertaining  film, and if you ever doubted Michael's genius you  won't after watching this. I could not take my eyes   off of the screen, and you will get chills more than  once. What a great talent we have lost.
1401323820|5.0|I am not really a book reader. I watch the TV show CASTLE so I wanted to see if it would keep me guessing like the show. I could not put it down. I wanted it to keep going and going at the end. It kept me thinking of who done it the whole time. If you love the show, you will love the book. I hope there are many more to come from RICHARD CASTLE. This book has made me want to read more like it.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I love Jane Austen.  I hate when her books are done on film and they are not true to the orginal story.  This film version left a lot to be desired.  Kierra Knightly as Elizabeth Bennett?  I don't think so.  The BBC has a great version of this story on DVD (Collin Firth as Darcy) and it is many times over better than this.  I may be a purist but if you are going to tell a story, try to stick to the book it is based on and don't cut corners to try to appeal to the those who don't even know who Jane Austen is.
B000LC4TJ0|2.0|The staging of the opera is boring, the movements of the singers are extremely slow and within 40 minutes you want to go to sleep. Perhaps the only thing remarkable is the vocal performance of Cherubbino, the other singers though good aren't outstanding.

B001ILFUD2|5.0|Oliver (Joey Lawrence) is an orange kitten, one of a litter of eight, whose siblings have all been adopted out of a big box on a Manhattan street, leaving him alone.  When a sudden thunderstorm destroys the box and sets Oliver adrift alone on the streets, he's bewildered and frightened--and, very soon, hungry.  A carefree terrier named Dodger (Billy Joel) offers to share some sausages with him if he'll help to steal them, then takes off with the booty, and a furious Oliver trails him, not without difficulty, to his hideout, a moldering barge anchored under a decrept pier which he shares with a human named Fagin (Dom DeLuise) and four other dogs--hyper Chichuahua Tito (Cheech Marin), aging and easygoing Great Dane Einstein (Richard Mulligan), cultured bulldog Francis (Roscoe Lee Browne), and leggy poodle-mix Rita (Sheryl Lee Ralph).  Fagin has borrowed money from Bill Sykes (Robert Loggia), who is pressuring him to pay it back, and when Sykes visits the barge to demand his dough and Oliver rakes one of his Dobermans (Torean Blacque, Carl Weintraub) across the nose, Fagin (\\"That took guts!\\") and the dogs are impressed and \\"adopt\\" him into the gang.  Next day, trying to help Fagin and the dogs find a way to pay back his debt, Oliver is accidentally trapped in a limousine, where he meets Jenny (Natalie Gregory), a little uptown rich girl who falls in love with him immediately, takes him home with her, gets him a collar and tag and a silver dish engraved with his name, plays with him in Central Park and lets him sleep in her bed.  When the dogs, fearing he's in trouble, innocently \\"rescue\\" him, he's devastated--all he ever wanted was a home and someone to love him.  But when Fagin tries to extort a ransom for him from Jenny, and she then falls into Sykes's hands, it's up to Oliver, Fagin, and the dogs--including Jenny's parents' spoiled diva of a champion poodle, Georgette (Bette Midler)--to save the day.    Based loosely on Dickens's [[ASIN:0486424537 Oliver Twist]], this movie will have viewers who are familiar with the book (like me) making interested connections between the original and the adaptation (Fagin, for example, is not Dickens's sinister Jew but a rather buffoonish street person).  It's rather short on music, but Joel's strutting \\"Why Should I Worry?\\" and Gregory's gentle \\"Good Company\\" are high points.  Each animal is a distinct individual with a personality of his own.  And when \\"Oliver and Company\\" set out to rescue Jenny, it becomes a wild thrill ride through the loan-shark's hideout and across a railroad bridge.  It also has things to say about friendship, honesty, love, and finding your proper place in life.  A sweet and charming film for cat- and dog-lovers alike.

B002IYEQR4|5.0|Ordered this from another site and was on backorder for like a month. I cancelled with them and ordered it here for a good price. It got here VERY fast, only about 2-3 days I think (with standard shipping). The package itself is very nice :) reminiscent of Watchmen: Absolute Edition; whuch fits well since this is the absolute edition of the movie. The movie itself was awesome :D it was the directors cut with the meta story Tales of the Black Freighter woven in. A really good adaptation of a really awesome story. It also included the motion comics on bluray which is AMAZING and it really allows you to see how alike the movie is to the comic. I HIGHLY reccomend this to ANY fan of Watchmen :D

B000U0F7RG|5.0|Pros. I love this box set. It seems bigger then the picture to me. The box set includes two books. One being an episode guide, this book is full of great pictures and a description of every episode. The another is a book full of terms used in the show and also has a lot of great pictures.   Cons. I moved all the dvds to another case because every time I take a dvd out it sounds like it is against sand paper. Since I paid $135 for the dvds I want to keep them in good condition and this seemed the best way to do it.

B002IC10Y8|4.0|Listening to CDs remastered with DSD technology is like buying SACD and listening to CD layer.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this 3d movie, the special effects are amazing, parts of the movie reminded me of other movies I had seen, the spiritual aspect reminds me of Starwars where Yoda explains to Luke that \\"The Force\\" is in the reeds, the trees,the rocks, all living things \\"that life creates it\\". In Avatar is exsists between all the living things, the trees, the creatures found on this planet and the indigenous natives. This race is primative no technology here, but seem to be happy as they know no other way. If they need to kill a living thing, they seem mindful of it's suffering and helping it's soul pass over to the after life. Then we have the greedy corporation with it's Army might, hell bent on getting what it wants and only making a faint hearted approach to negotiate with the natives. When they seem to be making some headway, greed steps in, and the way to get what they want now is by force, how ironic this is to the way we live on Earth. The movie does have a predictable ending with good prevailing over evil, but the true meaning in the film for me is that we never would have understood the indigeneous natives if their world had not been infiltrated by the Human/native clones, so for me the story is about understanding others,compassion,empathy and that the planet we live on is a living thing, that we need to respect and protect for future generations instead of living in the now, the question is what will we be leaving for our children and the future genarations?, if we have no respect for our planet and the technology we possess to save our planet, will we allow human greed to continue that seems to be hell bent on destroying this planet that we call home?, will the human race have a future here on earth?.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|One of my all time favorite films on so many levels. The behind the scenes documentaries and extras are really informative and fascinating. It's really something magical to watch the incredible physical efforts from so many in a time before CGI everything. This Blu-Ray edition is even sharper than the semi-recent re-release in the theaters. Get it! You won't be disappointed!
0226039331|5.0|But should really appear a question \\"why\\"?  I think, it is absolutely not necessary.  The one and only question about that classic item in the library of every Greek scholar, New Testament scholar, etc. is \\"When?\\".  It's mandatory. It's mother of many lexicons and father of many dictionaries.  So when? When it will appear on your bookshelf?
0552552127|5.0|Great transaction. The book was in fantastic condition and it arrived within the time it had listed online. I would have appreciated a quicker shipping time, but like I said it did arrive on time.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Although this is my first review of a movie I'm no rookie when it comes to high definition video. I bought my first HDTV in Dec. 2000 when OTA (Over the Air) signals were just beginning and I saw the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in HD. So why am I reviewing this DVD? This is the best video transfer of a movie that I have ever seen - period ! If you like the series do not hestitate to buy it. It is in two words . . . absolutely phenomenal. As far as content is concerned, it is exactly like the standard definition DVD that was released some time ago. That was the technical description of it, but as a western movie it also ranks high on my list. This is one of those rare movies that draws you into the story and never lets go. So if you like a great western with a beautiful picture this is it.
1892005034|5.0|Chapter nine in this book is about the way we communicate with ourselves.  I recommend all my clients read this book so they can become acutely aware of the way they are communicating with themselves.  I thought I was a \\"peaceful\\" one. . . until I read this book and listened to myself when I requested someone \\"take a stab\\" at an answer to a question.  Subtly \\"violent\\" verbiage; right?  The more I listened to myself, the more aware I became that there was work to do. Dr. Rosenberg explains \\"choice\\" that transforms victimhood to responsibility.  What a gift!  Highly recommend this book to anyone who is on a quest for self-development.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I got this game for a family member for Christmas without knowing anything about it.  I had only heard of it from her, and I was intrigued.  I wish I had heard of it sooner, because Settlers of Catan is highly addictive.  The best analogy I have is that this game is like a physical RTS computer game- you must gather resources to expand your empire before your opponents do.  It's wonderfully entertaining and not as long as similar games like Risk, which is mostly a good thing.  The pieces are well-crafted, though board tiles can take some persuading, and it looks like a quality product.  The only problem I've encountered is that it only hosts four players, so I'll probably start researching expansion packs soon.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This adaptation of this beloved novel is the wonderful combination of hot men and characters that we already love.  Every girl wants her own Darcy and if he looks like this Darcy does, you will dare any woman to make a pass at him!!  I love when movies kind of push the envelope just a bit with Austen's men and her beautiful heroines.  I think Matthew and Keira are beautifully matched together in this movie and bring the characters to life in a way that makes me want to know Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam personally.  With all Austen characters, I feel like that I am that girl in the story because Austen wrote stories that happened to real women.  Now, of course, we girls are looking for our Edward (Twilight fans, unite!!), but Darcy will always be our first love.  This is a must see if you are an Austen fan, just have heard of Austen, or just love hot men!!! Enjoy and bring your own hot man to hold you in his arms while you watch this beautiful film.
0694003611|5.0|I loved this book as a kid and just bought it for my sister's upcoming baby.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I have not had the pleasure to read this novel, but this movie adaptation is absolutely how I would see Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth.  This movie makes me want to watch these two characters over and over again. My absolute favorite Austen man is, of course, Darcy, but this Wentworth definitely gives Darcy a run for his money.  The way you see, through the way Anne interacts with his family /her family and their mutual friends, Wentworth's opinion of Anne changes and takes on a completely different shape is beautiful and just simply magical.  Watching this movie made me want to go and read the novel as soon as I watched it.  I have seen other adaptations of this story, but this is the best one I have come across.  This would be a good buy for anyone who has been in love, wants love, or who is in the midst of love.  If you are not an Austen fan, you will be after this film. Enjoy!!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I have not seen most of Start Trek, movies or TV series, but I loved this movie. Zach Quinto is excellent. And there's some serious hotness.
B001EJIMUG|4.0|I love all these movies. I also love the fact that you don't have to leave your house to   rent a video.
B00003CXI1|4.0|not the greatest movie, but i like having a visual interaction with the world of hogwarts
B00008CMR6|5.0|This is my favorite John Wayne movie.  I know some of the acting is not great, but I love the story and Jack Elam just cracks me up in this movie.
0061478784|5.0|I love the Miyazaki movie, but this one makes a lot more sense. It's really nice.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|The cynical take on tv media \\"reality show\\" corruption and hype is terrific, and it's a classic fairy tale of good triumphing over evil, and true love triumphing over human callousness.  Best of all, I can watch the finale - a seemingly spontaneous bhangra dance in a Mumbai subway station - over and over.  For me, it's a guaranteed feel good moment!
B002PMV9FG|4.0|Obviously, the books are better, but I like the movies. This one is not the best, but they do make good choices in terms of adapting scenes that work better in a book.
B002GHHHP6|5.0|I have always liked \\"Maverick\\" because it is both funny and entertaining. I wanted the DVD, and felt that the DVD cover format (keepcase) is neat and more practical than the traditional DVD cover format. The price is very reasonable.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I LOVE this movie. It's great for kids, but it also has deep environmental themes, and I like seeing a window into how Miyazaki uses similar-looking women to convey themes.
B002GHHHL0|4.0|\\"Deep Blue Sea\\" has been an interesting and well-paced action movie ever since it was released theatrically and then onto DVD. Like \\"Maverick\\", the DVD cover format (keepcase) is neat and more practical than the traditional format, and the price is very reasonable.
0307120007|5.0|I loved this book as a kid, and I just gave it to my sister for her impending infant.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I purchased the DVD as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves the show and has been watching the DVD's non-stop. We had a Legend of the Seeker Marathon on Christmas Day. now she picks and chooses episodes all the time.
0060254920|5.0|I loved this book as a kid and just bought it for my sister's upcoming baby.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I had never watched this show and then I bought the DVD of season 1 on sale at Christamas time, and it is the greatest. WOW! I cannot beleive that the show soes not get more recognition.
0399226907|5.0|I loved this book as a kid and just bought it for my sister's upcoming baby.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|If you like Celine you will love this DVD. I have watched it many times and the songs and choreography are terrific.  The backstage tour is also wonderful.  Better than being there in person, better than front row seat.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I bought it for my boyfriend not really interested in the movie. I sat down and watched the first 20mins and i was hooked! a great dvd set for anybody!
B002OB9KPE|3.0|After listening to Whirlwind a few times, the music has grown on me.  One definite area of improvement is the bass, which is now crisp and clear.  Unfortunately, the excellent instrumental parts are shorter and fewer due to excessively wordy lyrics...the weakest part of the album IMO.    I can see why some people are complaining about the lyrics.  Although words like Jesus and Satan seem to be purposely removed to avoid drawing a comparison with Neal Morse's solo material, I find the contrived ambiguity a bit of an insult to my intelligence. For example, alternative references to Jesus including He, His, Him, Giver of Life, Heaven, and City in the Sky are used repeatedly.  Of course, there are the opposing Satanic forces represented as The Master, The Wind, The Whirlwind, Dark Side that are utilized dozens of times throughout.  As someone who enjoys lyrics and believes that they can either enhance or detract from the listening experience, what could have been a good or even great album is brought down to merely average because every song leads to the same inevitable conclusion...i.e., Jesus Saves.     If you like the single-minded message of Christian lyrics or enjoyed the first two Transatlantic albums (which contain 5-star music and a variety of intelligent lyrical concepts) you will probably enjoy this disc.  Personally, I don't mind spiritual lyrics (The Flower Kings) but overtly religous stuff just comes off as preachy to me and unfortunately, does not add anything to an otherwise good musical effort.  Four stars for the music and two for the lyrics, an average of three stars.
B002BGFUPQ|4.0|Remember, this is not an Oscar caliber film, just don't put on your thinking cap, and you will enjoy it as much as I did. By the way, Sung Kang defiantly deliver, but the main guy... not so much.
B0014I4KIK|2.0|During my daily search for new music, I noticed that this CD got 4 out of 5 stars overall.  Based on the previous reviews, I expected to be blown away.  However, I found it painful to listen to Duffy's voice and could barely get through the entire CD.  Definitely not in Amy Winehouse's league.  I'll have to pass on this one.  Thank goodness I previewed the entire CD on Rhapsody before making a purchase decision.
B000KQF6X0|5.0|What can I say, I love this movie! I've already got the DVD, but I still want to get the Blu-ray version, that said it all. This is the one of the best work from Michael Douglas. And Ridley Scott is still the best Director in Hollywood IMO.
B000OPOAJS|5.0|Great story, Great acting and one of the best car chase scens on film. Enough said
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|Excellent! David Gilmour truly IS Pink Floyd. Always thought he was a good guitarist, but was wrong. He is an incredible guitarist.
B001E2JNA6|4.0|Excellent shipping and everything.  However there was a slight crack in the dvd case, perhaps could have been better packaged?
B001RIY49C|5.0|The head is so cool that I wish it do more than sound effects. Maybe a couple of lines from the movie, \\"I'll be back\\" etc...
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This is the best Blu ray on the market.  Quality is amazing, content is spectacular, and the movie is great, directed by JJ Abrams (Lost) and it has many tie ins to the old shows and movies.  Can't wait for the the next ones!
B0026P3G12|5.0|She has the most beautiful voice that I have heard in ages.    LOve several of her songs.  Wish we could get  Wings from Japan. But they won't let you so I just listen to it online.    Pretty good for a lady no one thought she would make it...........go susan
0316069906|5.0|The audience to which I would recommend this book is:  every American who can read.   This means, of course, that it should be translated immediately into all the languages Americans read.   In the meantime I would like to warn everybody who reads English that they are missing something important to their lives.  My first move after reading the book was to make some changes in my eating habits.   My second move was to give the book to my son to read.   He and his wife are also impressed with it.   My third move was to write my Congressman.   My fourth move was to recommend to a club to which I belong that it try to get the author to come be a speaker.   And I haven't stopped moving yet.   Thank you Mr. Foer.
1415743762|5.0|The series itself is fantastic, but the seller I purchased this item from did not send it in a reenforced package.  The bubble wrap ruined the sleeve during shippinng.
B000MV9026|1.0|I have kids that love animated movies. They hated this one. The adults in our family hated it too because of Robin Williams annoying voice. It was not cute, funny, nor entertaining. Save your money. This is one of the worst movies ever made.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Was happy to purchase because I saw it in the movies and loved it.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B0015519VS|5.0|Usher is the bomb! This album is a masterpiece. I love this album! I love Usher! You can follow his life throughout this album. You can tell the type of dedication this man put into his work. This is one of his best albums. I love Confessions as well. He did it again with this album. Everyone must have this album. It really has meaningful songs on it that's great for couples and love making sessions. I'm glad Usher decided to share this piece of work with us. He truly is one heck of a man!
0060578793|5.0|The SAS Handbook came within in 3 days of my order and it was in perfect condition.
B002QY9RMA|5.0|I love Beyonce and this album just showcased her talents. This album is incredible. I love this album. I love every single song on this album. She really outdid her self this time. She is truly the diva of the century. She's very talented and I know that she really putted her emotions and thoughts into her songs. You can tell from her songs which one's pertains to her life. She really nailed it! I love this album. It's no wonder most of her songs became number 1s. Everyone must have this album!
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|Needless to say, I'm of the 60's era.  It's been fun to watch all the 40th anniversay specials aired in '09, and this dvd really captured the sentiment of the time.
B002RKXO6S|5.0|Being an avid fan of Bon Jovi - I am a bit biased.  This is a great cd.
160094048X|5.0|I love this cookiebook and I'm definitely not vegan!  I took this book out from the library, but the more cookies I make, the more I want to purchase my own!  I've made the peanut butter blondies and the mexican chocolate snickerdoodles and both were unbelievable!  Might I suggest putting the peanut butter blondies in the fridge after you make them and eat a few warm.  They are SO TASTY cold the next day!  I can't wait to make more cookies!  Now I'm convinced that I have to look into their other books.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This is an outstanding production of the Dickens classic, with Tom Coutenay giving the performance of his lifetime. Andrew Davies should be knighted for all the great screenplays he has produced.
0783226063|5.0|I knew very little about Dune until the movie hype.  I remember going to see it in Lubbock Texas.  Some of the early reviews were coming back negative, and yet it looked exciting.  I was not really impressed with my first viewing. I liked this movie after reading the books.  The movie was my gateway to the book series.  The new series put out for TV has a lot more, true to the book events.
B000068FXX|5.0|What is there to say about this album, it's fantastic. It's my favorite of theirs and every song is good on it, which is rare.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Anyone who is a star trek fan should add this movie to their collection. It shows how the characters met and how they grew to interact with each other. Excellent movie. I loved it. I know you will to.
0743244257|1.0|This read like some sort of bizarre cross between DeLillo's usual affectless style and some awestruck lifestyle piece from GQ, or the more vapid passages of later Tom Wolfe (Man in Full and so forth). The structure and style reflect DeLillo's sparse elegance, but - and one wonders whether this was an attempt at something with broader audience appeal or potential for film adaptation - they and the author struggle to engage with a contrived and clearly unfamiliar world.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|What a great show. So simple but the performance is wonder. I can watch it over and over.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Disney's first great classic in a perfect presentation.  Deserves to be in the TOP 3 DVD/BLU-RAYS of 2009 along with WIZARD OF OZ and GONE WITH THE WIND. Even if you don't have a Blu-ray player buy this!  We'll all ultimately upgrade at some point.  In the meantime, the set includes a standard DVD for immediate gratification!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Ordered on Cyber Monday and got an awesome deal, love the series all at my fingertips.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|I purchased this as a Black Friday special and it got here extremely quickly! My nephew absolutely loved the movie (and the rest of the family enjoyed it as well). Definitely a great gift idea.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Soundtrack was great the exact songs that are on the movie.  Gave to my 12 year old neighbor for Christmas.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Couldn't wait to get her debut cd.  It is good and PROUD and WILD HORSES are the crown jewels to this CD...    It is great for a debut, but I am anticipating her second CD to be even better!  She will have a couple years to find really great songs rather than 6 months to get it together.    Congratulations Susan...you are an inspiration.
B002PMV9K6|4.0|aS USUAL, THE MOVIES ARE NOT AS GOOD AS THE BOOKS BUT THIS IS A FINE MOVIE.
0316286850|4.0|I was excited to receive this book since I had always admired Kevyn Aucoin's amazing work.  I thought the introduction to the book was wonderful.  For me, as a how-to guide the book falls short (yes, even with the explanations and drawings).  Somehow I cannot get my make-up to ever look like the photos.  But as a book to draw inspiration from this is a great book!  I am glad that Aucoin's work and legacy can be preserved with this publication (and with his other books as well).
B0018OAOQC|5.0|If you like Metallica and Social Distortion, I would HIGHLY recommend this band.  Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil is their best album.  These guys are amazing.
0471267554|4.0|This book is fantastic.  All the information and recipes are great but it is only a starting point when learning about the paleo style nutrition.  There are lots of resources that are out there like [...] and [...] as well as Dr. Cordain's blog.  I encourage you to keep doing some research after this book.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Excellent in every way - service and quality of product.  Action and story line are extraordinary.
B00110K62U|5.0|This is a fabulous presentation of Les Mis.  There is no scenery, but clips from the production, while a cast sings the music.  Huge orchestra, superb talent.  Definitely would recommend for any Les Mis fans.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Very happy with the prompt delivery.  Packaging was excellent.  Product was not damaged. Will order again thru Amazon.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Though I haven't read Elizabeth Gaskell's original novel, this was a lovely storyline between two opposing people with different upbringing, views and lifestyles, who come to learn more about each other and in the course, change their opinions of each other for the better. Jane Austen-like in romance and a good historical account of the 1800s life between the South, London area, and the North, Yorkshire area.  One of my favorite Gaskell stories.
B000Q66QAG|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for a december birthdahy.  It is a very good movie and even better in HD. You have to have an HD dvd player to watch it and the person I gave it to was able to watch it and has really enjoyed it.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|I did like the movie, however for all its hype, it wasn't scary, just entertainment. Might have been mad if I had rushed to the theater to see it.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie. I ordered it because by doing so my postage was free for my other purchase.I was pleasantly surprised as both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the story.I know nothing about \\"character development\\" or plot or any of the other stuff reviewers feel is important. I just want to be entertained and UP filled the bill just fine. I wasn't expecting it to be a tear-jerker but I even cried a little, early on. Totally thumbs up for me!
B002VE36YU|3.0|The movie wasn't very action packed. It was slow moving. The end had a bit of a twist to make it a little better but over all just an ok movie
B000S88JTS|5.0|I think it is Great, I haven't seen it in Years and was Certainly Glad I Bought it!!!
6305657947|5.0|This movie does a good job at mixing humor, \\"chick flick\\" romance, and suspense. You know right away that Thomas Crown is guilty but you are still intrigued and compelled to watch on to see what he does and how he got away with such a brazen theft! The chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo is electrifying and makes you want to see them together in another movie even though you know it wouldn't be the same because it's the wonderfully written script that invokes the chemistry!!  Too Bad!
B002SJIO5E|1.0|Twice I had ordered the blue ray District 9 from Amazon and both times the video did not open to play.  What is the reasoning?  My expectations were not met and delivery of a product that I had intended to receive and keep were not met on both occasions.  Otherwise I have been completely satisfied with previous orders.  I can only guess that there was a problem in reproduction.
0061730327|5.0|This is a heart warming and inspiring story of an incredible man. It is almost a miracle that someone who had to fight for his education, let alone existence, not only survived, but reached such a level of greatness. For those who argue about environment vs heredity, what does this story demonstrate?  I thoroughly enjoyed hearing Williams story and was happy about his success, that he richly deserved.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|I always loved this series.  Now it comes combined.  Good buy for the RPG/Adventure game fan.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I loved this movie .. But.. Hwo would charge over $700.00? for a  copy?
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Great film!  I overheard some people talking about this movie one night and decided to check it out.  LOVE IT!!!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I've watched this DVD twenty times, at least, and I do not grow tired of it.  The scenes are delightful - the houses, landscapes, seascapes, the interior scenes, candlelit dinners - watching these is like walking through a gallery of fine art.  The movie is very well cast.  The characters in this novel are subtle and complex, and, while an hour and a half of film is too little to capture everything, the actors do a fine job in portraying nuance of feeling and understanding.  It is said that we are to occupy ourselves with those things that are pure and noble and of good report.  This DVD is certainly one of those things.
B0000A118M|5.0|It's funny to me that John Coltrane's most popular album is also the one that was his first step toward the spiritual, intense free jazz of his final recordings.  As you can see from these amazon reviews, the detractors frequently focus on this - it's a lot further away from bebop and ballads than Blue Train, Giant Steps, My Favorite Things, the album with Johnny Hartman, or the recordings with Miles Davis.  Coltrane and his quartet uses abstract harmonies and rhythms (though they would go a lot further in the next two and a half years); Coltrane's playing uses plenty of nonconventional devices - squawks, screams, growls - and strains past the tenor saxophone's normal range.    If this sounds too much for you, this is not the place to start with Coltrane's recordings.  You're better off trying the recordings I mentioned above first.  Maybe over time you'll grow to love those recordings  enough to try this one.  If you don't, that's cool.  A potential primer for A Love Supreme is the album immediately preceding it, Crescent, which is similar stylistically but more accessible.    There are also lots of people for whom this would be a great introduction to jazz.  If you listen to rock with plenty of long, instrumental passages - Santana, Cream, Zeppelin, Hendrix, Zappa, the Allman Brothers, the Grateful Dead, Yes, King Crimson, etc. - then this album will likely make a lot of sense to you.  Many of these musicians were clearly influenced by Coltrane, and this album.    If you get this album and love it, you may be wondering where to go next.  A newbie may want to check out other classic, popular jazz albums (amazon has plenty of recommendations) or the list of Coltrane recordings outlined above.  Some may warm to this album's experimental edge and want to find out \\"where Coltrane went next\\" - you can jump into the deep end with Ascension, Meditations and Interstellar Space, or take a more cautious approach with The John Coltrane Quartet Plays and Transition.    Finally, there are several editions of this on the market.  If you're a casual fan, I'd stick to the 1-disc version - it's more than enough.  If you're pretty sure you're going to become a big Coltrane fan, I would consider the 2-CD version instead - it has the fantastic live version of A Love Supreme.    Whichever way you go, this album is a jazz classic - one of John Coltrane's best recordings and a personal favorite of mine.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|Liebe ist fur alle da is another kick ass album from the mighty Rammstein. Their best album since Sehnsucht.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|Like the live version of A Love Supreme released a few years back from Impulse, the four 1965 Half Note broadcasts have circulated among fans in bootleg form for a long time.  They come from the period after A Love Supreme, when Coltrane's music evolved rapidly and pushed the Classic Quartet concept to its limit, until it broke.  I think they are essential listening, particularly to those open to Coltrane's more experimental side - though they are tame in comparison to works like Ascension and Meditations.    I see a few criticisms in the other reviews, most of which I think are misplaced:    1) The sound - yeah, it's not perfect, but I think it's pretty good.  If you're used to pristine RVG productions, this might bother you.  If you can handle a bit of roughness, then you won't have any problem here.  It's certainly a lot better than the Coltrane+Monk Five Spot release or the 1967 Olatunji Center recording.    2) The incomplete takes - Very unfortunate.  It is what it is; the Half Note broadcasts were limited to 45 minutes or so.  The music that's here is great, and I don't think the incomplete performances negate that in any way.    3) \\"McCoy and Elvin are lost\\" - This is something that's repeated a lot and I completely disagree.  I hear a group that's super-tight  and totally on-board with their leader's concept.  They'd been playing together for five years!  McCoy Tyner does drop out on \\"One Down One Up\\", but that was a fairly routine thing on those tunes that featured Trane-Elvin duets (check out most live versions of \\"Impressions\\" and \\"Mr. P.C.\\" from 1963).  When McCoy does solo - on \\"My Favorite Things\\", \\"Afro Blue\\" and \\"Song of Praise\\", he sounds great.    If you like Transitions, Living Space, Sun Ship or the live version of A Love Supreme then get this ASAP.  My only beef is that Impulse didn't include the other 2 Half Note broadcast - there's one performance here, \\"Creation\\", that tops even \\"One Down One Up\\" in terms of sheer intensity.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|If you have any appreciation for the guitar, then you should love this blu-ray. Three excellent guitarists (Jimmy Page, The Edge & Jack White) all talk about what guitar playing and it's influnence in rock music means to them, as well as a few demonstrations of their abilities. They also provide input on what inspired them to write certain songs, notably Page talking about how he came to write Kashmir, curiously only in the extras. I don't know why this clip was left out of the theatrical release. All in all, and excellent buy for any guitar lover.
B0018RWD6I|5.0|It's funny to me that John Coltrane's most popular album is also the one that was his first step toward the spiritual, intense free jazz of his final recordings.  As you can see from these amazon reviews, the detractors frequently focus on this - it's a lot further away from bebop and ballads than Blue Train, Giant Steps, My Favorite Things, the album with Johnny Hartman, or the recordings with Miles Davis.  Coltrane and his quartet uses abstract harmonies and rhythms (though they would go a lot further in the next two and a half years); Coltrane's playing uses plenty of nonconventional devices - squawks, screams, growls - and strains past the tenor saxophone's normal range.    If this sounds too much for you, this is not the place to start with Coltrane's recordings.  You're better off trying the recordings I mentioned above first.  Maybe over time you'll grow to love those recordings  enough to try this one.  If you don't, that's cool.  A potential primer for A Love Supreme is the album immediately preceding it, Crescent, which is similar stylistically but more accessible.    There are also lots of people for whom this would be a great introduction to jazz.  If you listen to rock with plenty of long, instrumental passages - Santana, Cream, Zeppelin, Hendrix, Zappa, the Allman Brothers, the Grateful Dead, Yes, King Crimson, etc. - then this album will likely make a lot of sense to you.  Many of these musicians were clearly influenced by Coltrane, and this album.    If you get this album and love it, you may be wondering where to go next.  A newbie may want to check out other classic, popular jazz albums (amazon has plenty of recommendations) or the list of Coltrane recordings outlined above.  Some may warm to this album's experimental edge and want to find out \\"where Coltrane went next\\" - you can jump into the deep end with Ascension, Meditations and Interstellar Space, or take a more cautious approach with The John Coltrane Quartet Plays and Transition.    Finally, there are several editions of this on the market.  If you're a casual fan, I'd stick to the 1-disc version - it's more than enough.  If you're pretty sure you're going to become a big Coltrane fan, I would consider the 2-CD version instead - it has the fantastic live version of A Love Supreme.    Whichever way you go, this album is a jazz classic - one of John Coltrane's best recordings and a personal favorite of mine.
B000000WA4|5.0|I've long been a fan of the Smashing Pumpkins, dating back to their Siamese Dream album and before.  I liked how they can blend harder rock songs with other more subdued works.  When this album came out it quickly found its way into almost non-stop rotation in my listening queue.  This album was the greatest example of what made the Smashing Pumpkins spectacular.  I am writing this review many years after its release and after many hundreds of listenings and I still find it great.  It combines rock songs like 'Bullet With Butterfly Wings' and 'Zero' with softer sounds to make a terrific collection.  Having two full CDs of music gives you plenty to listen to.  About the only bad thing I can say about this album is that it was unfortunate that the Smashing Pumpkins brought out in the middle of their career because each follow-up album seemed to pale in comparison to this one in my mind.<br /><br />If you are a fan of alternative you have almost undoubtedly already listen to this album and formed an opinion on it.  If you are new to the Smashing Pumpkins or 90s alternative, this is one of the greatest examples of the genre and the band.  Do yourself a favor and pick this album up if you haven't ever listened to it and you'll enjoy it.
0393061310|5.0|After reading this book, I've gifted it to several friends.  I further encouraged each of them to pass it on when they finished with it.  It is an easily read but powerful look at our World as we know it and as good an implied condemnation of racism as any I've ever seen.  While this sounds very serious, the book is actually wonderfully fun and entertaining!

B001AIRUP4|5.0|My family loves this movie! The quality of the blu ray disc is exceptional. I highly recommend this purchase and so far Amazon has the best price in town on the blu ray. $30 at WalMart and Target so this was a great purchase for us.
B000ANVPPQ|4.0|Years ago, my dad purchased a VHS copy of \\"McLintock!\\" only to find out it was a bootleg copy. Eventually, he would find a new version released from the estate of John Wayne to replace the bad copy. Thankfully, Paramount has released an authorized version of the John Wayne movie on DVD and the difference is amazing. My dad could finally see the film in letterbox format (a more superior viewing experience than the \\"edited for your television\\" view for VHS) and in crystal clear sound and picture. Also the extras like the commentary track are wonderful. I never thought I would see my dad watch any movie with audio commentary on let alone \\"McLintock!\\".    My one major complaint is that this DVD came in late due to the people I purchased this DVD from. Hopefully, this will not happen again next time I purchase a DVD from certain sellers on Amazon.com. All in all, this is a great holiday gift for the John Wayne fan in your Family.

B000A2W8RG|2.0|This version of Dune has always been one of my favorites.  I've love the imaginative settings and the story line follows the book well, but the video quality of the DVD is very low.  It is watchable, but viewed on a big screen TV, it looks like an amateur copy of a VHS tape to DVD.

B0026P3G12|5.0|This DVD of Susan Boyle has the most wonderful array of songs I have ever had the pleasure to listen to.  Her voice ranges from sultry to the blues in each and every song.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|We are really enjoying the box set. We had not listened to entire Beatles albums in many years, so re discovering them has been a pleasure. We find ourselves listening to one or two albums on Saturday mornings, consequently we have not worked through them all yet. The last time we heard most of these songs was on an LP record with sound quality of 30 years ago. These are amazing, because while we know the song, hearing them in such clarity, and new sounds we did not notice before. Surround sound, digital sound of today makes you realize just how deeply this music was \\"thought out\\". It's kind of an expensive indulgence at such a tough time for many, but if you can buy without using credit to do so, I recommend it!
B000ZECQ08|2.0|One of the things that annoys me most about the movie versions of the Harry Potter series are the things they leave out or water down.  The book in this case is EXCELLENT, however the big reveal at the end and the battle scenes in the move was a COMPLETE and TOTAL let down.  I can't believe that they decided to dummy down the ending.  Where there was a explosive battle scene just after the Snape completed his agreement with Dumbledore the remaining scenes with Fenrir Greyback and the confrontation of Snape and Harry was very disappointing.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|Our family loves this movie.  Jack Black is super!  I looked at a lot of stores for this sound track and couldn't find it.  Glad to find the sound track at Amazon at a good price.
0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key is one of the best books I've read recently. Though it is very sad, it gives an insight to what the Jewish people must have endured during the holocaust years. I can't imagine living with the pain that Sarah felt due to the loss of her brother.
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|It had been years since I had seen this movie. I had forgotten just how \\"dark\\" the original story was. Still, Disney animation is great, especially since it uses 70+ year old technology, and the quality of the Blu-Ray is outstanding. Not sure I would recommend it for younger kids, but for older kids, including those of us who grew up with this, it is a great addition to any Disney library.
B002TUETW4|5.0|I now understand why amazon has the 1 click buys, I had just got This is it the Dvd and after having a few shots of J.D. and watching the dvd and feeling like I was 8 yrs old again, I bought this album with 1v click. I don't regret it though. It's good to hear the remasters and the poem at the end. Worth it. Happy to have had a drunken 1 click adventure.
B000003CM8|5.0|Critics for the most of them only know greatness 20yrs after the beginning, T All,am Brothers Blues Band is absolute proof the roots of blues are etched into the grooves of this record. I know this because a friend of mine sitting in the backseat of a 71 or 2 Mustang at the end of Whipping Post said, it was so good he thought he'd wet his pants. Now if that ain't proof of greatness I don't know what is plus its a great laugh.

B002ZHKZEM|5.0|I just love David Tennant as Dr. Who. His sense of humor keeps things on the light side so the series doesn't get as dark as Torchwood. He comes across as intelligent and funny at the same time, which is hard when a person is really intelligent (mostly they just come across as puffed-up or boring, depending). I'll be sad to see him go, but I'm glad that he did this last set of episodes for the delight of Dr. Who watchers.
B00004RF83|4.0|If ever there was a time to view this movie it is now, in todays poisoned political climate of distrust and near civil disobedience, re: Tea Party movement.      The plot is simple.  A once popular USA President is now on a path that is both protested by the general public to the point of mass protests, and reviled by a cadre of his top military leaders in the Pentagon.  They decide to attempt a coup d'etat.     Not only is this another top notch and suspenseful directing effort by John Frankenheimer, who stunned with \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" two years previous, but it is another tour de force performance by the vastly underrated Burt Lancaster, in the starring role, which propels this beyond ordinary melodrama.     Written by Rod Serling, yes that Rod Serling, (Twilight Zone, Requiem for a Heavyweight), and released in the year that the Viet Nam war was really beginning to ramp up, 1964, forty five years later it is still a relevant cautionary tale of political intrigue.     Lancaster, as an immensely popular general with Presidential aspirations, is at odds with his President (Frederick March somewhat channeling his William Jennings Bryant characterization from \\"Inherit the Wind\\"), over a disarmament treaty, and is planning, with other top military staff, to depose him.  Kirk Douglas turns in another competent journeyman effort as his top aide who stumbles across the conspiracy and agonizes over the rapidly unraveling realization that his trusted boss is the leader of this plot.     While the plot begins to unfold, Edmond O'Brien, as the crusty Senator, and Martin Balsam, as a trusted Presidential aide, add character to the story. Only Ava Gardner seems wasted as a necessary plot device needed only to propel the story forward when needed, and then forgotten.      Generally speaking the acting is top notch, the pace brisk and never boring, even at almost 2 hours, and the dialogue crisp and terse.  My problem with the movie is that even though it has an underlying tension, caused mostly by the interplay between characters, the conclusion is foregone and inevitable.  It seemed forced and anticlimatic.  But the final, brief confrontation between the General and his once trusted aide about the nature of betrayal, more than made up for the flacid ending.     I give it 4 out of 5 stars as an entertaining and thought provoking diversion, something that seems to be missing in most of todays overindulget theatrical releases. Do you hear that Oliver Stone?

B002SJIO4A|1.0|Have not watched the DVD. It did not get to me. Must have got lost in the post somewhere. How?
B001RIY4WE|4.0|SKYNET EDITION<br /><br />This movie is unbelievably amazing on Blu-ray disc.  The picture quality and sound quality is superb and for it's age, I do  not think this movie could possibly look any better.  The skynet edition is interesting.  We get 3 versions of the film.  The theatrical, director's cut, and the extended director's cut which is un-lockable with a password and has an alternate ending.  The alternate ending can also be watched separately in the special features so I would recommend watching the regular director's cut since the alternate ending in the extended is not linear with the rest of the franchise and it's sequels.  Although the ending is interesting and worth a look.  As far as special features go, there are not as many as the ultimate edition dvd had but there are still many including BD live features that I have not had the chance to check out yet as I do not have my bluray player hooked up online.<br /><br />I do have some cons with the features.  Many of the features like the behind the scenes stuff are in a picture-in-picture format.  This means you have to be watching the film to view these.  While this is an interesting take on commentary because we not only hear them talking about it, we actually see it, this is not something that appeals to me.  I have never been a commentary guy.  I rarely listen to commentaries and for me to have to watch the whole movie just to watch some behind the scenes stuff does not appeal to me.  Some people might feel the exact opposite.  I personally would rather have a behind the scenes featurette.  The games are also played while the film is playing.  As a matter of fact pretty much all the special features require you to watch the film.  This is why it is over 8 hours worth of special features, because you have to literally watch the film 4 times with each feature turned on.  I do not know what the BD live features are, but I hope to get connected soon to find out.<br /><br />Another issue I have with this disc is the load time.  It takes several minutes to get to a screen that says you are not connected to skynet, you may watch this disc without being connected click here to do so...  something to that effect.  You then have to click that you want to watch the film.  When that part comes on, I go make some popcorn or something because the screen is blank for at least 5 minutes.  It is slightly annoying and I have to really want to watch the movie to go through that ordeal which makes the skynet edition slightly less appealing.  However every player is different and some work much faster.  Also I do not know if hooking it up online would help.  At least it wouldn't be searching for skynet so it is a possibility.<br /><br />Even with the extremely long load times I recommend this blu-ray because it is the best version of T2 available.  T2 isn't a movie you throw on to pass the time, you put it on to experience.  Throw it in, let it load and go make some popcorn.  By the time your done the menus will be loaded and you can pick 1 of 3 different versions to watch.  Sit back and enjoy T2 in 1080p HD with complete master audio!  It doesn't get any better than this!  And I can honestly say there isn't a Terminator movie better than this!.

The only thing i must say about this CD, it is a newly remastered one, with new versions of his classic songs, i have the same CD also a few years older and most of the songs there sound a bit more original, more cooler, more spotlight on his voice and not somuch on the music. On this CD it takes some time to get used to the new digital instruments used in a very dominant manner. But as said it will only confuse you if you have owned the older version before, a great piece of music.

B001FB4VXU|5.0|The second season of The Big Bang Theory is terrific. Each episode is filled with side-splitting comedy and good sitcom story telling. The entire cast is right on the money, especially with Johnny Galecki's great deadpan line deliveries and Jim Parsons shining brightly as Sheldon Cooper. Jim Parsons makes one of TV's most insufferable characters both loveable and hilarious. Sheldon giving detailed instuctions to Penny over the phone as the boys travel by train to San Francisco is alone worth the price of the DVD set. Each episode (a stand-out is Episode 20, The Hofstadter Isotope) is outstanding from beginning to end showing off the entire cast's excellent comic chops as well as those of the creative team around them. And the gag reel is not only funny, but also shows how hard working these young actors are.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|I have fallen in love with the \\"Playing for Change\\" DVD and the CD and often watch it late in the evening when the songs are running through my mind.   The message is strong, but understated.  It simply shows how music can be a unifying force across the world in a time when there appears to be so much divisiveness.  It is so neat to see the unity in action, each contributing to the impact of the number.    We had a house fire back in September of 09 and when we get to move back to our home, we will invite all the neighbors who \\"stood by us\\" during and after the fire for a gathering, perhaps a potluck, at which I plan to show \\"Stand by Me,\\" the first song on the DVD, and pledge our support back to them.

0792163710|5.0|This movie was filmed 3 years before I was born, I first saw it at a drive in theater in the 50's with my parents.  Since then I have watched it probably 50+ times, Every time it came on TV I had to see it, when I got my first VCR I was able to record it, later purchased it on VHS then DVD and will get it on Blu Ray when available. Others here have given you the story line so I won't go into that. I was watching an episode of the TV series Happy Days a few years ago; One of the guys had a pending date to fight another so he went to Fonzie for advise. Fonzie's advice was to do something \\"Just Like in Shane\\" His friend's response was Who's Shane? Fonzie said You have never seen Shane? !!!!  Well if you have never seen Shane you have missed a classic.  Update Feb. 2012- My dad told me that Shane came on TV and he sat and watched it again even though he has the DVD. This is one of those movies that if you just happen to come across it while channel surfing, you have to watch it.

B000TGJ80S|4.0|This 3 time Academy Award winning movie is based upon Bram Stoker's original novel, Dracula. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather) this film is highly original and creative. Coppola takes full advantage of the movie's eerie nature and plays with shadows, settings and costumes. In this version of \\"Dracula\\" Coppola tries to bring out Dracula's psychological and emotional aspects. It shows how Dracula had lost his soul and was forced to remain undead for the rest of his life while feeding off the blood of the living. This movie is definitely not for the faint-hearted. Starring Anthony Hopkins, Winona Ryder & Keanu Reeves. Warning: This film contains excessive gore, strong & heavy sexuality and nudity.

B0009UC7QQ|5.0|The Truman Show, though funny at points, deals with a serious theme. Like Plato's Allegory of the Cave, this film deals with a similar situation with a modern twist. The film is the epitome of America's obsession with reality television. The film was released when shows like Survivor and Trading Spaces were conquering the airwaves. How far could reality T.V. actually get? The Truman Show, undoubtedly, would be the result.<br /><br /> The film deals with Truman, a man that was abandoned at birth and was adopted by a television corporation. His life was turned into a TV show as he grew up in an artificial town known as Seahaven. Its creator is Christof, who oversees the day to day pseudo-reality of Truman's life. In many ways, he represents the ultimate modern man. He calls himself \\"the creator,\\" but unlike God, his creation is all artificial. The entire TV show revolves around Truman, and the only way to make this possible is to have absolute control of Truman's surroundings. This not only includes the town in which he lives, but the people he comes in contact with, and even the weather itself is manipulated to fit the desires of the shows producers, depending on the mood they want to set for a specific episode.<br /><br /> The cost to obtain high ratings comes at a heavy price - Truman's freedom. From the moment of his birth, his future was already decided for him. Everything from his job, his wife, and even his father's death, was all scripted. He doesn't even have the freedom to be with the one he loves most. In the film, he falls in love with Sylvia, who at the time was playing her role as Lauren. As time passes, he tries to seek her out, and when he finally does, they meet secretly in a beach where Sylvia tries to tell Truman that his life is a T.V. show, but before the message was able to sink in, Sylvia was taken by another cast member to keep her from revealing the truth. Off the show, Sylvia continues to fight the producers of the show by making phone calls,persuading them of the immoral and dehumanizing effects of the show. Truman's longing for Sylvia was his ticket to freedom. During the course of time, since his separation from Sylvia, Truman begins to piece together cut-outs of magazines by taking eyes, mouths, noses, ears and hair from different models to create the image of Sylvia's face. Explicitly, this image represents his longing and love for Sylvia. Implicitly, however, the face he created is the face of freedom. In a sense, Sylvia, for Truman, becomes Lady Liberty. Like immigrants arriving on Ellis Island, the first face Truman would see once he is free from his bondage would be the face of his Lady Liberty, Sylvia, who at the end of film rushes to greet him into the real world.<br /><br /> Truman's main journey in the film is the discovery of truth. Similar to Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Truman must search beyond his surroundings and day to day routines to discover the true nature of his identity. These people and surroundings he comes in contact with constitute his own shadows. These shadows are his world of \\"ordinary things\\" (Plato's term for the lesser physical world), but if he is to discover the truth of the real world (\\"world of forms\\"), he must step beyond his own cave and into the natural light.<br /><br /> It is man's curious nature which leads him to wonderment. One of my favorite moments in the movie is when Truman asks Christof: \\"Was nothing real?\\" Christof tells Truman: \\"You were real.\\" Truman was the only one in Seahaven who was authentic. This, thus, brings us to the notion of authenticity and inauthenticity. In many ways, Christof was right - Truman was the only real person. Even Christof himself was not living an authentic life. He had fooled himself into thinking that he was some type of god who can control people's lives. Truman desires freedom so much that he yells out at Christof: \\"If you want to stop me, you'll have to kill me!\\" As Truman fights for his life. amidst the raging storm, an employee implores Christof to cease the storm. He tells him, \\"You're going to kill him in front of a live audience!\\" To this Christof indifferently responds, \\"He was born before a live audience.\\" Christof has played the role of God so long that he lost his own authentic identity and created for himself an artificial one.<br /><br /> Another similar and interesting character is Meryl, the actress that plays Truman's wife. Not only is she a puppet of Christof, but she sells her body for higher ratings.  She tries to persuade Truman to have a child with her, which would undoubtedly have the same fate as his father (not to mention safeguarding the show's longevity). There's no doubt that Meryl would have received a great bonus if she were able to conceive a child on live television. The moral applications to this would be absurd. The meaning of sex would be reduced for the sake of higher ratings. In many ways, this could be considered a form of human trafficking. When Truman refuses to have a child, and Meryl leaves the show, the producers are forced to hire a new actress to play the role of Truman's love interest. It's as though they were hiring a prostitute with an acting degree. All this trouble for the sake of becoming the first television show to feature the very first live conception.<br /><br /> At the movies end, Christof, in an attempt to persuade Truman to stay, tells him that the world \\"out there\\" is the sick world. He tells him that by staying here in this artificial world he can provide safety. Ultimately, however, Christof cannot control human freedom. He may have seemed omniscient by having cameras all over his artificial world, but as Truman so emotionally put it: \\"You've never had a camera inside my head.\\" Truman's desire to be free and authentic leads him to say those famous words he often repeated one last time, officiating the end to his inauthentic career: \\"In case I don't see you, good morning, good afternoon, good evening and good night.\\"
B001RPD06I|5.0|I've been massively using this microSDHC 16Gb card in the last 2 months in a BB8900 and it works just the way it should. The Class 2 speed is perfectly acceptable, it takes less than 1 sec to save a ~1Mb sized picture taken with the BB. The adapter works well too. I'm pretty satisfied with the product.
B00005JPKE|4.0|This movie is about letters discovered on the island of Iwo Jima 60 years after the war. The movie (filmed on location) focuses on what was written on those letters. This movie shows the gruesome reality of the battle of Iwo Jima as shown through the eyes of the Japanese soldiers. This Clint Eastwood directed movie is entirely in Japanese with subtitles (winner of the Golden Globe Award). At times, the film seems a bit longer than what is necessary, but overall, a magnificent film.
0307383415|2.0|Boring, amatuerish.   However, the book reveals much of why Obama is such a liberal and pro entitlement programs.
B002DYKP88|5.0|Winner of the Academy Award for best foreign film (2002) and winner of the National Society of Film Critics Awards for best director, this film is highly artistic and philosophical. It tells the story of a great hero on a quest for revenge, only to later realize that there is a higher purpose to his journey than just vengeance. This movie holds deep underlying meanings within its play of colors and music. The movie score is unbelievable (composed by Tan Dun).
1592402690|5.0|I've read a lot of books about the Beatles through the years, The Beatles by Bob Spitz, Ticket to Ride by Larry Kane, Miss O'Dell, by Chris O'Dell (most disappointing book ever), Wonderful Tonight by Pattie Boyd, Many Years from Now by Barry Miles and John by Cynthia Lennon, to name a few.  Never have I read a book that told what the Beatles are really are all about ...the MUSIC! How the songs came together, the ideas came about, who wrote, who played, who sang what, how the  sounds were devised, etc.      And on top of all that how they, John, Paul, George and Ringo interacted with each other and the studio people during the making of these sounds from the eyes of someone not so close personally to any of them, at least in the beginning.  While Geoff becomes friendly through the years with Paul, he never sugar coats their strengths or short comings nor does he bash anyone of them personally, he just tells it like, in his eyes & mind he saw it.  He's obviously a people watcher who forms opinions as to why a person acts, reacts or interacts in a particular way and I liked hearing that side of the Beatle story.  He did not socialize outside the studio with them so it's strickly from a working stand point and I found it fascinating!      As a bonus I learned so much about how a record is made, not a simple task of getting a group together in a recording studio, everyone singing the song together a couple of times & picking the recording that sounds the best... oh no, much, much, MUCH more is involved!  Now I listen to the songs again & again trying to pick up the special effects and sounds he mentions in the book.  I only wished he had more songs to tell us about!  It was like being a fly on the wall!  I LOVED this one!

0061876747|4.0|Climatologist Adam Kindred and immunologist Dr. Philip Wang met by chance at an Italian restaurant near Royal Hospital not far from where the Thames flows through Chelsea as each dined alone on tables next to each other.  The former is in London trying to obtain a research fellowship position at Imperial College while the later works in Oxford at a pharmaceutical firm as a sort of allergist.  Wang departs while mumbling something about a good feeling but leaves behind a file with his papers.<br /><br />Adam picks up the documents so he can return them to Dr. Wang.  However at the immunologist's flat, he finds Wang's dead body.  Not sure what to do as someone is after him besides the cops who have evidence of his visit to the dead man's apartment, Adam flees for his life.  Meanwhile, Wang's boss at Calenture-Deutz, Ingrym Fryzer, realizes someone at the firm wants him out and Wang's data on an anti-allergy drug that the scientist was working on is missing as the board refuses to wait any longer to market the drug to get the profits though the late researcher was not finished testing it.  Fryzer, his shadowy adversary and his paid assassin, and the cops seek a thirty-one years old climatologist who vanished somewhere in Chelsea.<br /><br />This is an exciting fast-paced thriller in which a young man seeking a job becomes the focus of corporate killers, an ethical CEO, and the Metropolitan Police.  The two subplots converge though a series of coincidences starting with the restaurant encounter, but fans of action-packed conspiratorial tales of the avarice affluent vs. a lone reluctant everyman will enjoy Ordinary Thunderstorms turning into a torrent for Adam.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B0006PV5US|5.0|This SACD is one of six that I own of this RCA series.  Like the others, its audio quality is superlative.  All of these re-issued, re-engineered RCA Living Stereo albums reveal just how high the recording standards were 50 years ago.  This recording is from my parents time and its possible my father might have had the original LP.  (It was his infectious interest in \\"high fidelity\\" audio that got me hooked.)  Now I get to hear and enjoy these excellent artists whose musical accomplishments are often legendary.  Recommended!
B001PPLIEG|4.0|As an avid James Bond fan I feel that Daniel Craig's Bond is a terrific and more accurate portrayal of Ian Fleming's character. This movie is good fun and action packed - though not quite as good as Casino Royale.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|The Joshua Tree is one of the best albums U2 has ever made. Bono's voice was at it's finest, deep and passionate. The music, utterly ethereal (as on Streets and With or Without You), or hard-hitting and angry, as on Bullet the Blue Sky and Exit.     The remaster definetly does the album justice. There is a book, five picture post cards (which I have framed), plus all the B-sides from the time period and a never-before-released concert DVD from Paris, July 4th, 1987. Also on the DVD are two unreleased music videos, one of Red Hill Mining Town; the other an alternate version of With or Without You. The DVD also includes a funny documentary of U2 and their travels across southwestern America.     If you are a U2 fan, and in particular love the Joshua Tree, get this remaster right away. It is well worth the money.
0060594896|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to get ahead in life. It provides for a lot of introspection and will challenge the reader to do things that will bring about change. This book should be required for high school and college curriculum.
0199535639|5.0|Wilkie Collins created a fantastic novel which could be read in the manner that most of the reviewers have interpreted this book. Boy meets a mystery woman, falls in love with a look-alike who is forced to marry an evil man and eventually the woman in white reveals some secrets and conveniently dies. The early lovers reunite with the help throughout the book of the sensible sister. What really happened? This book was not written by one narrator, but many narrators with conflicting agendas. What if we assume that all are slanting their narratives to mislead the reader? Who is telling the truth?   When you ask these questions and dig into the motivations and backgrounds of each of the narrators and characters, a very different story may emerge limited only by the imagination of the reader, but guided by Wilkie Collins. Were the accidental deaths accidental? Remember who was the narrator describing the accidental deaths. Were the good guys serial murderers, so they could inherit all the wealth in the end? What was the real relationship of the three heroes? These questions haunted me while reading the book and re-reading the book. I challenge anyone to re-read The Woman in white and question the motive and the story of each narrator as if you were attending an inquest or a trial. Did the narrators cleverly hide the truth from the reader?     I have never read such an intriguing novel
B002Y0KR84|5.0|GReat movie! Awesome clarity on a older movie! Love the fact it came with a regular DVD and Blu ray!
0440238153|3.0|I wish I could say that this was one of the best series I had ever read.  Sadly it isn't.  And I had such high hopes for it.  I watched the movie of The Golden Compass first and it intrigued me.  So I looked into the book and discovered it was a triology.  I really like that first book, but it's been downhill since then.  First and foremost, The Amber Spyglass was long.  And the funny part is I'm not really talking about the number of pages, because I've obviously read much longer.  There just seemed to be too much of everything in this book.  Too many characters to keep track of along with too many worlds that seemed to be interacting.  And the story was too complex even for me.  I've noticed that people seem to love or hate this book, but I'm firmly in the middle.  I don't dislike it for the reasons that most people do.  I don't think it's anti-god or anti-religion.  I just found some of the ideas presented in the final novel to be way out of the realm of reasonable thought.  And, I would love to talk to a preteen who has read these and understood them.  These books don't present the same way the say The Harry Potter Series does.
B002T45VX6|2.0|I have to say that when I heard the 1st song (She Wolf) I was happy cos I was listening to new stuff from my fave singer. Thne it started to get old (after 1 month) and I realized that this was how the whole cd was gonna be. Its dissapointing to think that this is the same woman who did awesome songs, deep songs, that make you go \\"wow I never thought it like that\\" or \\"you know what i'm feeling right now\\". She's a singer who has a brain to compose her own music and can sing really well yet has chosen recently to write this type of mindless fun. It gets old fast, i rather have a smart thinker than a beautiful dancer any day of the week. OK back to the cd, like I said I'm not crazy about it BUT there are 2 songs Gypsy & Mon Amour, where you can feel the old Shakira (just a little if u can ignore the music). Where she hides beautiful lyrics that make you feel good and remember the good old times. Love her, not so much this CD, BUT that don't mean that I'm gonna abandon her cos I know how good she can be... I guess I just have to listen to her spanish cds...

B001UGIIMA|4.0|One of my most viewed DVDs got an upgrade..Its alot sharper and you can enjoy Tony Scott's filter happy shots. The guy who directed Top Gun has become fond of lense filters,green,yellow etc. in his later films. At least in this film there are no flashy subliminal-like cuts as in \\"Man on Fire\\". It was also nice that he dedicated this film to his Mom who passed during the filming. It's an appropriate dedication since its arguably one of his best films all around.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|I think that this boxset must be more than that, a simply boxset. There is nothing else that the same cds you could have one by one, and the dvd only contains a few minutes of videos that are also in the cds. Why don't put a well made book with reviews, photos, etc...? And the sound isn't as great as they say, where are the sacd versions???

It wasnt all pretty either. He entered the word of chefdom primed and ready for everything evil to put into his life and body. Sex and drugs and rock and roll all while making a lovely and delightful crab bisque for the couple at table 7.<br />Bordain DOES let you in on a few back room secrets that sometimes will make you wonder if you really do want to patronize an unknown eaterie..Bordain is just plain entertaining to watch and in this case, to read.

0307276902|4.0|This was a strange little book...on the one hand we have James Frey embellishing most if not all of his recovery from addiction, misleading all readers and self aggrandizing his disease. On the other, this was, admittedly, a true page turner, one which took me only a short time to finish (I took this on with all the knowledge of Frey's delusion). This dichotomy is what faces me as I try to objectively review this \\"best seller\\".      Maybe this perversion is what Frey originally had in mind and if it was (assuming the reader can get past the untruths) then this still is a work worth reading. No literary marvel here (again perhaps Frey's intent) the reader is bombarded with straight-ahead no b.s. prose that constantly attacks the senses and draws you in. The character development is certainly un-Dickensian but stays true to the vein in which Frey portrays this story...hard, to the point and all with a million flaws. I'll wager that most who start this book will fly through it with gusto just to see how this haywire cast ends up and to see if Frey's impertinent approach to recovery works.    So, I have to say go on and take the plunge. Knowing Frey's betrayal, one should still read this for what it is...a dark symptomatic account of addiction and recovery that hits you over the head and leaves you (left me at least) with a better feeling for what the dispossessed go through.
B0026P3G12|4.0|The range of songs on this album is incredible.  From hymns to broadway to rock and roll anthems.  At times I thought I was listening to a different artist.  Susan Boyle is one of the most unique voices to have stepped into a recording studio.  I hope this is the first of many more diverse albums from this amazing voice.

Also included are transparencies of various grids; ie. 4x4, 9x9, 21x21, star-grid, hex-grid, etc. Every quilter should include this book in their reference library.
B0026P3G12|3.0|Susan has an incrediblly beautiful voice.  Unfortunatly her acompanient, her orchestration was extremely weak.  The orchestra could have enhanced the listening pleasure of this CD.  Instead it diminished what could have been an excellent album.
B002RFX9R2|3.0|This \\"Singles Collection\\" is a good release but I consider that could be better if \\"Fantasy Records\\" had been released it when \\"Creedence\\" was \\"alive\\" and not 40 years after. We must think that people who likes \\"Creedence\\" could be now between 50 and 60 years old and it's not the same listen the songs \\"in era\\" as listen them such a long time after. People can appreciate the art of the box and the quality of it but I repeat, \\"the CCR's. fans could be very very happy 40 years before\\"... now, it's too late. It's only a \\"collector release\\" to leave it \\"sealed\\" over the desk.<br />Also this release includes picture sleeves that are not the same as the originals singles released by \\"Fantasy Records\\" between '67 and '72.<br /><br />Federico Andr&eacute;s La Rocca

Endless personal anecdotes describing the background and defining moments of yet more famous/influential people....<br />I read it all, hoping that the content would reveal a more insightful analysis of \\"how to find your element\\" as this is what the book seemed to lead me to believe it would help me to do.<br /><br />Look truly, maybe it's a bloody brilliant book because you realise that if you can hack reading all this rubbish you have the temerity to achieve anything...<br /><br />The \\"secret\\" to the element....<br />follow your passion.  Oh puh-leeezzzeeee........<br /><br />This boring book of lectures about the absolutely obvious made me feel so silly for having been dumb enough to have purchased the book.<br />He's probably spot on about our education systems stifling creativity and the negative impact this will/already has on societies, but oh goodness, its a dull read.<br />Honestly, go and purchase something that will teach you something useful, like the Getting things done series and apply this to your life and you'll be closer to the element than if you had only read Mr Robinson's book.<br />This book was a waste of time.

B0026P3G12|3.0|I admire Susan Boyle's voice and courage to set the world on its ear.  Maybe we need to realize it is what inside a person that is important, not the cosmetic appearance.  She has a beautiful voice, I play her CD on the way to work, and before a busy day her voice is a reminder to me, that we all can do what we say we can't do.  The quality of the CD could be better on some of the songs, I was a little surprised about that, she is a magnificent person, with a quality to her voice that is refreshing to hear, I hope she makes more CD's and can continue to \\"WOW' audiences whereever she goes.  Good for her!  Also, it was nice to Simon in shock!
0385523904|5.0|Even though I am busy taking care of three small children, I used every free moment of my week to read this book.  It provided rare insight into a world I have been interested in for years.  When I read the author's New Yorker piece recently I didn't know she had a book coming out.  The New Yorker piece of Mrs. Song was riveting and this book provides a more full account of Mrs. Song and other North Koreans.  This is one of the most satisfying reads I have enjoyed in years.  Well done!

B000007R13|2.0|It was such a disappointment when I cued this disc.  I looked forward to hearing a spacious recreation of the Fillmore and the ABB playing loud.    The sound quality is great, but the mix is terrible.  Duane is more behind you and there is no focused soundstage, more audio hocus-pocus than an audio document of one of the all time best live rock concerts.    Do yourself a favor by choosing the SACD version of this disc.  It is a different mix and it is very enjoyable.  This statement is even more accurate if your system accommodates HDMI 1.3.

055358894X|5.0|I bought this book based on previous reviews I read on the web. They were quite accurate as the book is magnificent. Not one dull or boring moment. Very fast paced, really well told, interesting characters, great setting, leaves much to grab at later, (there are hopefully six more books on the way!)  Highly recommended, I couldn´t put it down. The last 3 fantasy books I had tried to read were a PITA, I just ditched 2 in the process: Wicked by G. Maguire and The mirror of her dreams by S.R.Donaldson and the other I read but in constant agony and boredom: Dragonflight by A. McCaffrey. In comparison TLOLL was a blessing.  Enjoy it!

However when studio execs insist on useless note after useless note or change or \\"maybe add a dog. everyone likes dogs.\\" , I have to blame them and not the creator of the product for it's failure to be renewed.<br /><br />After all, You are talking about a network the consistently sets its own shows up for failure and then cancels them because the ratings aren't big enough. This is after they have made repeated blunders by interfering with the show or moving them around on the schedule.<br /><br />Examples in no particular order:<br />Firefly - FOX interferred with series order, put on Fridays, and cancelled it after only 8 episodes had aired and refused to air any more. Thank God the movie was made by Universal and not FOX. I hate to see such stupidity rewarded.<br /><br />Dollhouse - FOX interferred with series order, demanded plot changes, put on Fridays, decided not to air during Nov sweeps and then cancelled it because ratings weren't high enough. Fu(King M0rons! Once you get past the mandatory interference from the FOX execs, you got tighter storylines (episodes 6 and up) and as usual much more continuity and charactor development that Joss is justly famous for.<br /><br />Terminator:TSCC - Put it on Fridays and complained that it cost to much. I have no sympathy for FOX. Look at the fanbase screaming to see the mistake made here.<br /><br />Profit(1996) - Cancelled after airing 4 episodes and no DVD release. Watch it yourself and decide after that.<br /><br />Brimstone - Got one season of 13 episodes. It was the Supernatural of its time. Good call, jacka$$es. Wasn't even released on DVD. I had to torrent these to get myself a copy of the series. At least they didn't make any money off me.<br /><br />Family Guy - Seriously, they cancelled it, TWICE, and only brought back due to DVD sales. How many years is it now?<br /><br />Wonderfalls - Ordered 13 episodes (only aired a few of them before cancellation) and a dvd release. Another Bonehead cancellation from the people at FOX.<br /><br />Keen Eddie - \\"was an offbeat comedy/drama/buddy cop show that successfully fused British style with a very American sarcastic cop, and it was close in tone to Guy Ritchie movies. And it had Sienna Miller! It would have been easy to miss this show on Fox, as they shuffled it around the schedule and canceled it after seven episodes (6 unaired).

I have enjoyed all of Joss Whedon's work (BtVS, Angel, Firefly, Serenity, Dr. Horrible and now Dollhouse) a great deal and I recommend this to anyone who likes stories that entertain and make you ponder ethical questions.      \\"The Difference between Genius and Stupidity is that Stupidity has no limits.\\"
B0009UC7HA|4.0|The attempt at capturing one of Clive Cussler's action fiction is great. The characters are believable and well played by actors Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn. It is an action adventure set in the Sahara Desert complete with enemies with automatic weapons and a beautiful lady doctor. The DVD is well worth the price. Enjoy.
B000002GFC|4.0|I purchased this album specifically for one track, but found several other great songs from the recollected past.
B0019LY5IM|4.0|I have bought all the seasons of LOST on DVD so I wanted to buy this for my collection.  The show is the best on television--for me, it is the best drama of all time.  I do wish there were more extras.  Other seasons seemed to have more fulfilling extras and this one seemed more hastily done.  I always like the deleted scenes and the bloopers, but for some reason the extras all seemed too short.  Maybe I just love the show so much that I always want more, but in prior seasons it seems like it took longer to get through all the extras and this time I got through them all rather quickly.
B001EN71DG|5.0|This was in great condition although took a little longer than expected yo get here it still was deffinately worth it
0756656230|5.0|Excellent book. Ideal Xmas present, very well received. pity it wasn't available in UK, thereby attracting a large charge for postage from US.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|Great movie, and the picture quality was outstanding. I only wished I could have watched it in English, but the movie was so good, that it still deserves 5 stars!
0060094273|5.0|This is a super book for young children.  This one is a board book, so it's sturdy & friendly for little hands.  Besides the book, you get a cute little pair of socks, all for one low price.  We got this set for some friends of ours who were expecting their first child.  The father immediately wanted to open the package and read the book.   He said that it had been one of his favorite books as a child.  It's a fun classic!
0061733199|5.0|this handbook is well written and organized.  the descriptions and diagrams are complete and helpful.  the topics covered are broad-ranging.  this book is in my bug-out bag.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I use the Ear Force X41 to watch movies and play games off of my 360.  I have been using this product for approximately two months and find that it performs well.  The only thing I don't like about the X41 is the occasional hissing noise I hear.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Not the page-turning thriller we are used to . The story line seems contrived. and the main focus of the book seems to be espousing the authors religious viewpoint. I skimmed over the last chapter, the action was over and the rest was just more dribble.
B00003003R|5.0|This album is perfect! From Nightrain to Paradise City it rocks. The true masterpieces on this album are November Rain, Patience, Rocket Queen and of course Sweet Child O Mine.  Welcome to the Jungle and Paradise City are rocking tracks that just plain rock . My favorite tracks on this album are Move To The City and Knockin' On Heavens Door.This live album really epitomises what Guns N Roses are (or were) about.
B002IR3PSC|5.0|Pretty good audio quality for the time, much better than Live in Germany.  Wish Martin's guitar was louder in the mix, but that's my only complaint.
0141439513|5.0|The story is famous and in no need of review. The Penguin classic has decent size print and makes the effort to come as close to the original manuscript as is reasonably possible. What more is there to want? Also the price is excellent, so that it will not be difficult to replace after I have worn it out.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Excellent Service. Product in excellent shape upon arrival and received in less time than expected.
B001UV4XUG|2.0|I wanted to like this movie but it just didn't happen for me. I can't fault Joespeh Gordon-Levitt (Tom), as I thought he did a fine job, I like the character of his little sister and the one truly great moment for me was the nice little dreamy dance number. But....    The story of a romance that doesn't work, told through various scenes of their courtship, presented in random non-sequential order. Could be novel, I suppose but my quibbles are with the story. It simply felt hackneyed. All the touchstones that Tom and Summer (Deschanel) share that are supposed to be unique seem very immature. What college girl doesn't suffer a love of The Smiths? I cannot imagine being thirty and talking about my love of Salinger (feels a tad immature). And liking Edward Hopper? That's not some underrated artist that very few would know about. The writer wants this to feel like a fated meeting but they're all dime-a-dozen references. I would expect something more esoteric, more meaningful if they plan on building a relationship together.    And because they both acted they way I remeber acting as a teenager I could never place them. Were they meant to be 20 or 30? If they are young then it would be very surprising that a girl so dead-set on independence would change her ways so thouroughly as to become engaged within a few weeks/months. But, at that time I really didn't care as to what was going on. Her character was so off-putting that I was happy he was through with her.    This one is a time-waster and I would suggest a pass.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Any Sandra Bullock fan will absolutely love this movie. Teamed up with Ryan Reynolds, they make an absolutely adorable odd couple with a wonderful mix of insanity and romance. The Alaskan scenery provides and astounding backdrop. This is a must see movie and one that after you purchase, you will watch over and over.
B002436WFI|3.0|The Color of Magic is entertaining but not too funny. There are some interesting characters and ideas, but the movie lacks depth and does not always make sense. The book with the same characters related to the movie, The Light Fantastic, is better. But the book is very much written in the same style as the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books by the late Douglas Adams, which are better than the Light Fantastic.
0439023483|5.0|Set in a dismal view of the future, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins follows the story of Katniss as she is sent into the arena to fight for her life in a game of survival. Chosen through a drawing created by the corrupt government of Panem, one boy and one girl from each district is sent to the games. The children must fight to the death and the winner is the only one left alive. Katniss must choose between life, love, and loyalty in a story that makes us question our ideas of quality entertainment. The Hunger Games is the first in a trilogy with the final book being released in summer 2010.    Sarah's review:  The Hunger Games is a delicious morsel of a book that leaves me starving for more. Although it is considered young adult literature, the themes of the book relate to teens and adults alike. The story is told from Katniss's point of view and the reader is really able to get inside her head. She is the warrior every teenage girl hopes she will be. The love story that begins to unfold is juicy and enticing and I had to follow up immediately with the second installment in the series, Catching Fire. The Hunger Games is an adventure from start to finish. It's a quick read but will stay on the mind long after you are through. Although the concept of the book seems farfetched, it makes one think about how far reality TV will go and exactly what we consider to be entertainment. Why do millions of Americans engross themselves in shows like Survivor, or worse yet, Jersey Shore? As for me? I'll stick to books like The Hunger Games.    Erienne's review:  Suzanne Collins does a superb job with her first book in The Hunger Games trilogy. Not only is the novel filled with excitement that leaves you not wanting to put it down, it is also jam packed with thought provoking issues such as desensitization and the value of human life. The gruesome death match is aired on television for all to see and the people of Panem are required to watch. While the people in the districtsdo not particularly enjoy this, those within the Capitol find it intriguing. Viewers cheer for their favorite contender and simply watch while the chosen children kill one another in hopes of being the last remaining survivor. The onlookers within the Capitol hold little regard for who lives or dies while those within the districts are watching for even a glimpse of their representative. While The Hunger Games is a book where you will find love and excitement, it is also a book that will leave you thinking about many of the issues that we encounter today.

B002RSDW80|5.0|Meryl Streep's standards are the highest acting qualifications any actor can reach in the movie business;that she's among the greatest ladies of the cinema of all times such as Katharine Hepburn,Bette Davis,Greta Garbo,Vivien Leigh or Geraldine Page just to mention a few of the inmortal actresses of all times. Due to her versatile techniques,styles and convincent acting performances,she had earned huge admiration and respect as such for movie audieces as for the movie industry. This lady was born to act.She dominates brilliantly the skills of acting amazingly well that until now she owns the record as the most nominated actress in the Academy Awards history,15 nominations and two wins. For her performance in Julie & Julia she will be nominated and it seems to be,that this time she will be honor again with her third win.Although this movie tells the story of two different women in different times,it's mostly a Meryl Streep movie.She's the movie herself,without taking out merits to Amy Adams,which as a matter of fact created a charming role and was a great team with Streep.Meryl Streep's rendition of icon Julia Child is a superb,brilliant,delightful and masterful piece of acting.This woman is a proud for the celluloid.A well deserved Oscar worthy performance!!!
B000F8O35U|5.0|This was a hard to find item, which I TRIED to buy on Ebay, but the seller took over a month to get around to sending it, so I cancelled my order with the Ebay Seller and came to Amazon -- which I NOW Know, I should have done in the first place.

B00005LC1H|5.0|This box set contains all of the episodes of the original BBC series. I don't care how many times you watch these, they are pure comic genius and this set is an excellent entertainment value. Watching these at home allows the viewer to catch more of the comic subtleties in the show(like the hotel sign at the beginning of the show). There is a kind of chemistry between the cast members of this show that is unique only to Fawlty Towers. The extras included in this set are some bios on the cast and some little known facts about the series.

B002TZS5GU|4.0|As a lethal virus spreads across the earth, two brothers and their girlfriends seek to find a place to call home that is plague-free.  Along the way, they encounter some infected, and must become outlaws in order to survive.<br /><br />The script here is really good, and it touches on the human themes of morality, mercy killing, muder, and survial- the acts that must be taken in order to survive.<br /><br />This movie is so good, in fact, that I would hope they make a sequel to it.  There is enough story left to tell at the end that the filmmakers could create a sequel out of it.<br /><br />Acting was good, direction was solid.  Well done film.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint does an amazing job of being funny and insulting all the same time in this saga of a grumpy old guy who turns out to be an exceptional human being. I love all the insults he hurls at his neighbors and how he takes his revenge on the bad guys. Very Eastwood indeed. This movie is my favorite of all his movies and I don't know why. It just gets to me. The title song he wrote plays at the end credits and it's one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I cry every time I hear it. Clint is extraordinary in this flick and you just have to see it and you'll agree. It's a gem! -R. Lodato
B0002IQNAG|5.0|This is an outstanding DVD.  The presentation is fabulous and the movie is classic.  Anchor Bay has outdone themselves.

Fortunatly I know some americans, so I will always get it out of my system.:-)  The movie is great for any James Bond fanatic, but loose ends that makes you sit and wait for the rest.

B002LK3DUQ|5.0|From the beginning, Pixar has made films based on premises that I thought were going to be bad. A film about toys? A film about bugs? A film about fish? A film about talking cars? A film about a cooking rat? Yet, time and again, they've not only made the premise work, they've made it exceptional. (Actually, I didn't personally like the cooking rat film, but my point still stands.)<br /><br />So by the time that I saw a preview for Up, I knew not to dismiss their weird premises. A film about a house flying because it's tied to a bunch of balloons? Eh, they've done weirder.<br /><br />What I was not expecting, but should have, was that this flying house would provide the backdrop for a deeply poignant film about overcoming grief and embracing life. While all the films carry important thematic elements, I'd say that this is the first of the Pixar movies that adults can actually appreciate more for the adult themes than kids will appreciate for the fun parts. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of fun stuff for kids ... but the story is something you have to be a little bit older to really grasp.<br /><br />From the first few minutes, where we see a montage of Carl Fredrickson's (played by Ed Asner) life, adults especially connect to him in a very personal way, because it's clear that he's led a rich, full life ... but also that many unanticipated, tragic things have happened to him. He is now an old man, a widower, and about to lose everything. So, in reaction, he decides to go on a final adventure ... and take his house along with him.<br /><br />The adventure, though, is really the old adventure he (and his wife) had always longed for but never achieved. It was not intended as an affirmation of his life, but a conclusion to it. It was not about boldly stepping into the future, but about connecting to his past. And, through the course of the film, Carl realizes that life isn't over until it's over.<br /><br />It's a powerful message, woven into a film which kids will appreciate for the cute chubby Wilderness Explorer Russell, the talking dogs (some of whom fly airplanes), and the big crazy colorful bird. But someday, when they're much older, they'll realize that they had very different adventures from the ones they once dreamed of ... but that doesn't make them any less valuable. And maybe they'll think of Up, and realize there was a lot they missed in that film.s Explorer Russell, the talking dogs (some of whom fly airplanes), and the big crazy colorful bird.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|One thing to say: IT AWESOME to watch the entire series, commercials free!!!   The box is ok and no problem with the DVDs, everything work/play perfectly and the shipping and wraping was wonderful!    Buy it if you realy liked Friends!!!!!    Ben.
B000M4RG42|1.0|I bought this DVD after reading the book and anxiously waited for it to arrive.  I guess great anticipation leads to great disappointment because this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  I even watched it again just to be fair thinking maybe I had had a bad night.  No, it was even worse the second time.<br /><br />Let me say that I was incredibly moved by the book.  It made the human experience of WWII real to me in a way that no History Channel documentary ever could.  I felt I knew the characters and was moved to tears by their stories.<br /><br />The screenplay and direction of this film is so muddled and disjointed that, if I hadn't read the book, I don't know if I could have even figured out who the characters were.  There is virtually no character development so it's hard to know who the people are or why they are doing what they do in the film - or why you should care.  The battle scenes are intense but the grey, jerky, surreal filming technique is distracting and annoying.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood's movies but this time he just fell down flat.
1416594787|5.0|I read Dr. Dawkins most recent book \\"The Greatest Show On Earth\\" and found that most of the information basic for anyone who already has at least a Bachelor of Science degree in biology. For someone who has attained a graduate degree in the subject will find it very much a fundamental basic review of evolution. However, Dr. Dawkins is not directing the content of the book toward scientists in the field of biology or zoology. The overwhelming majority of biologists and zoologists already accept and acknowledge the importance of Darwin's Theory of Evolution to biology and zoology and do not need to be convinced.     Evolutionary Theory is also important in the fields of geology and chemistry as well, but to get back to my point. This book is for individuals who are not well versed in biology and wish to have some semblance of understanding that will allow them to logically differentiate between the nonsense that is often being passed off as science (creationism and intelligent design for instance) and actual scientific theory that is well supported with evidence and data. Dr. Dawkins does not overload the reader with data and evidence in his book, but that is not an indication that the evidence does not exist. Dr. Dawkins did not want to weigh down the average reader. For further depth and understanding of the evidence supporting evolution, one needs to explore college level biology textbooks, museums for paleontology evidence (fossils etc...) and most science journals at your local university library.     Dr. Dawkins knew who his target audience was going to be. He did a splendid job and I think he achieved his goal.

B000Q6ZG5M|4.0|The KD upgrade doesn't fully deliver in this film.  Some parts are magically transformed while other moments seem to retain their 480 luster.  I think they should have taken more time on this one to perfect it lied they did in later HP movies.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I usually don't buy soundtracks. I love this CD! I have purchased additional CD's from two of the artists, featured on this CD - because I heard them for the first time on THIS CD! Buy it. You won't regret it.
0553582461|5.0|I'll try and avoid any spoilers in this, because most of the enjoyment of any book is the discovery of what each page reveals.  That being said, Fool's Fate is one of the most well written final books in a series I have ever had the pleasure of reading. So often, I'll find a series that is so good at the beginning, but begins to feel rushed or cheapened the further it goes along. Not this one. I became so attached to the characters, starting in the Assassin's Apprentice  right through to the final pages in Fool's Fate. I absolutely love the Fool, even knowing that he is just a fictional character, he holds a place in my heart. I know that may sound silly or fan-girlish, but there is just something about the way Hobb's characters leap of the pages and become so real that makes it difficult not to grow so attached.   I can't say why without revealing a spoiler, but I have never wept over a book as I did with this, I mean heart-wrenching sobs. There is somethng about the way Hobb weaves this beautiful series together, climaxing perfectly in the final book, that will have you longing for more when it ends.   That is the only complaint I could possibly have with this, is that it was the end of something wonderful.   If you are at all on the fence, read the first Trilogy (Farseer) and then the first 2 of this one. While it is explained well enough that you could jump in and not be too lost, it will be so much better if you're able to get the full experience.    If I could give more than 5 stars, I would
B001HN69AE|5.0|To start off, I myself am a HUGE fan of Dragon Ball and anything there of.   But it makes me almost ashamed to be one when I see these children putting this movie down because \\"it isn't Dragon Ball\\".    Well of course it's not Dragon Ball. Was I the only person who noticed the tag \\"An ORIGINAL Motion Picture\\"?    If any of you \\"fans\\" had any kind of sense then you would know that the show you grew up loving was far from the \\"real\\" Dragon Ball series.     Use some common sense and stop putting this movie down. It was very well done for an ORIGINAL script.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|This is a classic movie to be shared with friends before the remake comes out. It arrived promptly and was a Christmas gift for a friend who had never seen, as I had in the theaters.
B000H1RFKU|4.0|Good performances by all in this drama set in the South Central area of Los Angeles. Denzel is excellant, as usual. Good realism, good story, a little short on the ending, but still good.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is a wonderfully silly, smart (if maybe smarty-pants) film, weaving together several \\"quest\\" narratives, the oldest of plots--mostly the Odyssey, but  with many  nods to Sullivan's Travels (including the in-joke title) and the Wizard of Oz (especially the KKK-rescue  scene).  Lots of Americana in it (besides the great music).  It's not necessary to \\"get\\" the allusions, but I think those who hated the plot misunderstood it.  One criticism, however, does seem valid. O Brother relies on a lot of rural/Southern stereotypes.  The Coens are often smug in their character-mockery.  But the use of grotesque, cartoon-exaggeration is their way into surrealistic farce, and they make brilliant use of it as they do in all their films, taken as a whole:  from suicidal CEO's and personal trainers to rabbinical wisemen.  In their defense here, one might note that the Southern crowd turns against the hypocritical candidate when he begins spewing race-hatred. They want to hear the music. Joy and absurdist hope are as prominent as cruelty and corruption. A great film.

B001S86J1C|5.0|Besides the idea of all of us want to do what Ferris did in high school, the quality of the picture was very good, this is a very old movie, but the work they did was fine, the sound is not spectacular but I like it, they could virtualize it through the 6 channels and left anothers sound to be heard. I can advice u to bought this item is you like this kind of picture.

1416594787|1.0|After reading Richard Dawkins 437 pages of \\"The Greatest Show on Earth - the Evidence for Evolution\\", I was struck by the number of times the subjunctive mood, of suppositions about the Theory are used.<br /><br />His guesswork is very entertaining, as was Charles Darwin's.<br /><br />There were around 800 such uses of \\"if\\", \\"maybe\\", \\"perhaps\\", \\"possibly\\", \\"might\\", \\"suppose\\", \\"could\\", \\"suggests\\", \\"conceivable\\", \\"seems to suggest\\" etc, in my copy of Darwin's 429 pages of  \\"The Origin of the Species\\".<br /><br />But, Richard Dawkins, by far, surpasses his high priest of Materialistic Philosophy, with 1,079 uses of such examples of the subjunctive mood.<br />...and he admits to expecting us to fall for his \\"seduction\\", to accept such an excessive level of subjunctive concoction to be scientific \\"fact\\"???<br /><br />PS: I would like to draw your attention to a comment on page 3 of the Comments thread below, from \\"Agnostic Apatheist\\", which is an excellent observation, deserving of reprinting here:<br /><br />\\"While I think a one-star rating is a bit harsh, I must concur with Kenneth Murray's criticism that the excessive use of tentative or subjunctive words is quite distracting and weakens the reader's confidence in his argument.<br /><br />After all, his book is called the \\"evidence for evolution\\", not the \\"i think there is evidence for evolution\\" or \\"the highly plausible case for evolution\\" or \\"how the evidence might conceivably make a case for evolution\\".<br /><br />Moreover, Dawkins quite strongly denies the existence of God in his \\"God Delusion\\" book, and he is equally adamant about calling evolution a fact in interviews. So I find it strange that he uses such tentative wording when describing the evidence\\"...

0316069906|5.0|I am never disappointed by Foer's writing. This book takes you on a personal journey of discovery (for his future/recently born son) and offers its readers insight into modern day practices that we should frankly all be absolutely ashamed of. And yes, Foer offers this information without judgment, letting his readers decide where they stand and what they want to do about it. It's a beautiful gift that should act as a reminder for his son...not only how much his father loves him but to what lengths he will go to find out the truth for him.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story is wonderful and brutal.  Surprisingly relevant in an age where Hollywood produces shows like &#34;Kid Nation&#34;,  &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; is deeper than the jacket description would indicate.  The novel is well written and thought provoking, and though it echoes of other, similar, works, it stands alone and should not be thought of as a simple derivative.  Not for all young adults, &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; is perched in that wonderful place between children's and adult fiction.  While other, more obvious, themes and questions abound, thebeating heart of the novel seems to ask &#34;what would you allow?&#34; whether District or Capital member.  A hard question to ask oneself whe you actually look at the current state of the world  and the places we find entertainment.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|To me, this is one of the more somber of Pixar/Disney features. It touches on greif, friendship, and loyalty. I laugh and cry everytime I see it. Rent it first if you're not sure about the crying part...I'm positive you'll wanna purchase it afterwards ;>)

B0002YLC24|5.0|I think it depends on your age and frame of mind, but I identified with Before Sunset more than Before Sunrise.  Both are must-sees and genius work by Richard Linklater.  It's impressive enough that the entire 3 hours of screenplay between the two is pure dialogue between 2 people.  But the reality of the conversation, the stumbling, the idiomatic expressions, mispronunciations - everything is just so real.  In Before Sunrise, it seemed a little odd that Jesse (Hawke) just said he was from the \\"US\\", with no real city identified.  Before Sunset is a much more mature interaction.     Ethan Hawke is a fine actor, but Julie Delpy really blew me away.  A couple of my favorite quotes by Celine (Delpy) from the ferry ride just before Jesse has to leave for the airport:      Questioning how lasting their relationship might have been or could be...  \\"Maybe we're only good at brief encounters walking around in European cities in warm climate.\\"      Rationalizing the mistake they both made by not exchanging phone #'s/addresses...  \\"I guess when you're young, you just believe there will be many people who you connect with.  Later in life, you realize it only happens a few times.\\"    That last quote really hit home for me.  I do hope Linklater makes a 3rd part to this story, though my sense is that he wants the viewer to make up his mind as to what happens next.  Similar to the way Jesse's book ends.  The reader doesn't actually know what happens after that one night.
B00030DEQE|5.0|My default NIC for my Solaris 10(_x86, AMD Quad-core) and works as expected.  Solaris has already have driver installed.
0451228731|3.0|Others have said it in the space before me.  The book begins with a fascinating concept, but becomes a bit unfocused in the middle (think TV's \\"Lost\\").  However the end doesn't do much to bring the threads back together again.  Like a Dan Brown novel there is an underlying concept which is quite fascinating and the author's extensive knowledge of the subject really brings it out.  Also like a Brown novel, the dialogue is average to weak (i.e. people just don't speak/act that way), but that's not why you are reading this book.  This is not great literature, but is certainly entertaining for those that like Crichton, Brown, etc. All that said, its not a wasted read just one that doesn't quite live up to its lofty initial potential.

B0036CYKQE|5.0|Because of Fox's stupidity, the final episode of season one wasn't even aired in the US.  But I bought the full season here and had time to view that episode before the series finale.  Anyone who has loved this show should watch that.    Anyway, as soon as season 2 comes out on DVD I will buy that too.  I'm just sorry that FOX will probably reap the profits from it...  Whedon is a genius and I have loved every show he has created.
0307269752|5.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has a wonderful compelling plot. The mystery is embedded within a story that has well written characters that, as a reader, I truly liked and knew. I also enjoyed a window into the culture of a country that I have never visited. This is a great book.
B002CPD5LM|5.0|The show was outstanding with the people who have worked with him over the years.  The extra portion showing the surrounding area could almost eclipse the show.
0756656230|5.0|I got this book for my 10 year old brother this Christmas and I'm pretty sure he has it memorized already. I also got one for his friend who is just as excited about Lego's. This book has GREAT pictures, good quality and a lot of information about the history of Lego's. This would be a great addition to any Lego enthusiasts collection.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful showcase of Susan's incredible talent. To me, a truly great singer is one who can sound good in all genres - and Susan definitely does!    I highly recommend this CD - it's a broad-ranging selection of songs, with something for everyone, and all beautifully performed. Susan Boyle truly deserves her fame.
0446567337|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS SO GREAT!! It Felt like I Knew Exactly how they felt and the descriptions and words he used... It Made the story so real... As if had really happened! I loved the book... And I just feel like re-reading it all over again! It mad em cry and laugh... And I dnt think thats ever happened to me... especially with a book!  READ IT PEOPLE!
B00005JNDZ|5.0|The product as well as the service of the provider was excellent. The product was as it was described and I give this seller 5 stars. I will buy again from this seller without a doubt.

0307266303|4.0|This book inpired me to purchase and run in a pair of Vibram Five Finger Shoes I have been a runner since age 11 during the running craze of the 1970's. I love runing in my minimalist shoes, and my feet are just fine but the stitching came apart on one of the shoes after just two months. A critique of over engineered running shoes is just one of the diverse topics covered by this book.      McDougal also presents some detail about the Tarahumara tribe and his personal experience with this semi legendary people culminating in a joint run with American ultra-runners.  He provides a portrait of these people that does not gloss over their hardships at the same time extolling their runing prowess and even their diet.  Who knew that Chia seeds, which I would associate with Chia pets, are a super food?     The American elite ultra-runners are portrayed mostly as a highly eccentric group. Perhaps this is accurate.  I am skeptical as to whether an average runner like myself with a full time job and other interests could or would aspire to join their ranks.  I don't think that the average body can take that sort of abuse with or without excessively padded running shoes.    This is an entertaining and thought provoking read. McDougal's material on theories persistence hunting as the origin of human long distance running make sense.  The implicit thesis that anyone could be an ultra runner, however, is dubious.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|I replaced my 6 year old access point with this model because I wanted the security and reliability that I found in the router from the same series that I already have. My previous access point had either been hacked or failed and I was concerned about security. The setup (after updating the firmware) is very clear, the security features are excellent and easy to configure and the performance has been excellent.  The range is much better than on the old access point and there is the reputation of Cisco behind it.  I had been disappointed with some earlier Linksys products and support (from 2003 & 2004) and had replaced all of them years ago.  Since Cisco took over and then created this small business line, those problems appear to have been eliminated.
0743298039|1.0|I just don't get it... this was one of the most painful books I have ever read. If it wasn't a book club pick I would have dumped it about page 100. Very tedious read - so tired of overrated reviews and fiction with a total lack of substance. Big waste of time.
B002RHL8DC|1.0|Why did they have to ruin a good thing. I wish they could have sticked to the Atlantis story line. This is a poor drama filled excuse of a show. If I wanted to see this much drama I would watch a soap opera. I want to see them explore the universe and meat fascinating alien cultures and new technologies. I don't want to see them complain for an entire hour about their unimportant problems. It makes me sad to see that they ruined Stargate.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|This is hands down my favorite Sophie Kinsella book, and I've read them all. In general, I vastly prefer her NON-Shopaholic novels to the Shopaholic series, but this one is the best even out of those. The last 15-20 percent of the book had me alternately laughing and bawling. If you like her other stuff, PLEASE read this. Don't be put off by the whole ghost aspect -- I almost skipped over this one because of that but am so glad I didn't. It's really a funny and heartwarming story.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|Excellent movie
B0000VD04M|5.0|My favorite Johnny Depp movie, Ed Wood is a hilarious and (kind of) touching tribute to arguably the worst dramatic director of all time, but a man who stumbled into producing great comedies.  The supporting cast holds up their end, with Martin Landau, in particular, doing a great Bela Lugosi.  The DVD extras are of decent quality with the best being how they made up Landau to look like Lugosi.
B000KF0NI4|5.0|Excellent.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Five stars are not enough to rate this album!  Maybe ten stars, or even more!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|The excellent movie
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|UP is a fantastic movie.  The animation is terrific, the story line is great.  There is a scene early in the movie that literally brought me to tears.  I didn't expect to cry at an animated movie (I guess I cried at Bambi too...) - but it was well worth it.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I ordered a Shawshank Redemption DVD after I continued watching the movie every time it came on tv. It's a great movie that shows perseverance of one person who was wrongly convicted of a crime and spent 20 years in jail. It's a good example of what goes around, comes around and that good usually wins out in the end. There is one scene at the beginning I could do without although it's not graphic it is a little disturbing. If you have not seen this movie I highly recommend it.
B00006GA4C|5.0|Grand Funk, coincidentally, shares a distinction with KISS. Each band recorded and toured behind their first three studio albums, which sold to an appreciative and loyal audience, and each issued a \\"double live\\" album as their fourth that put them through the ROOF.    Both bands were \\"you had to be there\\" acts...the frenzy experienced during live shows didn't fully find its way into their initial studio offerings. Where they differ, however, is that Grand Funk's \\"Red Album\\"...the second...and [[ASIN:B00006GA48 Closer to Home]], the third...hit harder on impact and have had a greater staying power than those of their \\"hottest band in the world\\" counterparts.    Grand Funk had humbler, working class roots, regardless of the ear-splitting volume of their music. They were the guys from Flint Michigan who made it out, who didn't get jobs at the auto plant, who worked and played hard and tasted success...until Terry Knight cashed their checks through his victorious lawsuit and they had to start all over again.     \\"The Red Album\\" begins with \\"Got This Thing On The Move,\\" which immediately engages the band's \\"power trio\\" style, carved several years earlier by acts like Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience. \\"Please Don't Worry\\" starts off like an over-amped \\"Born To Be Wild\\" before slipping into a mid-tempo groove. \\"High Falootin' Woman\\" works off of a shuffle-based blues riff. \\"Mr. Limousine Driver\\" is the first track that really offers a glimpse of the sound that would follow on \\"Live Album\\"...fat, meaty riffing coupled with slow, cocky vocals from Farner, with everything adding up to classic Grand Funk. On the 8-minute \\"In Need,\\" you've got a \\"custom made for live performances\\" vehicle with ample stretching out and solos. \\"Winter And My Soul\\" shows that the band had more up its sleeve than sledgehammer riffs...things like melody, shifting time signatures, and songwriting far more complex than they were given credit for at the time. \\"Paranoid,\\" in the world of \\"album oriented\\" FM radio, was probably the most heavily played song from \\"Live Album,\\" and the \\"Red Album\\" version naturally lacks some of the energy found in its more familiar counterpart. Same for \\"Inside Looking Out\\"...it sounds fine here, but it got bigger and meaner in concert halls. \\"Nothing Is The Same (Demo)\\" is an added CD bonus, with some \\"mind-expanding\\" trippy guitar work from Farner and a Don Brewer lead vocal. The \\"2002 Remix\\" of \\"Limousine Driver\\" is nothing to write home about, but at this point, you're at the end of a rock-solid album sounds as good today...maybe even better than...it did on its release over three decades ago.    And like all GFR fans, I still hold out hope that Brewer / Schacher / Farner will mend fences one day...with Craig Frost, if he's willing and available...and give the world one more taste of the REAL Grand Funk.
006016848X|4.0|I had this book years back and have longed to reread it.  Library's in my rural area do not carry it.  I found this book very enlightening, so entertaining and at the same time true to my path in this world.  Thanks for the opportunity to own it again.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Having grown up with the 1987 CDs (some in mono, some in stereo), I have longed for a modern mastering of these classic albums.  The Beatles Stereo Box Set is very well done.  The tracks are crisp and clear, without any hyper-compression or over-loudness that sometimes fatigues records of today.      The early records sound a little lopsided in stereo, but these are the true stereo mixes as they were printed in the early 60's.  Hearing Sgt. Pepper and the White Album remastered is a real treat--very much improved over the 1987 printings.      The video mini-documentaries are a little too short for my taste, but there is some different footage than from even the well done Beatles Anthology videos.    A must for any Beatles fan!  And, a great way to enjoy these albums if you don't have any of them already.
1416550542|5.0|It is often hard to find a book that completely engulfs you in the story, and the lives of the characters. This unique book is one of those treasures. I had a hard time putting the book down, because each page presented a new clue in solving the mystery of the four year old who didn't know her name, but ended up half way around the world in Australia all by herself. Kate Morton really did a great job of revealing the characters and having \\"flashbacks\\" to different time periods that were revelant to clues that were being discovered. It was a rare treat because you didn't often see what was coming next, and you don't see the end coming in chapter 3 as so many of the books I have read lately. If you are looking for a mystery to solve, this is a great book to escape into.
0307269981|5.0|Though this book started a bit slower than the first, the writing keeps you involved and motivated to find out what has happened. Am very excited for the final book in the trilogy, only with Larsson was around to give us more.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan has a beautiful voice. I play it all the time. It's been a long time since I went 'crazy' over a CD and had to have it. I bought one for my 42 year old son and he is playing it a lot, too. I can't wait to buy her next album.
B000002KOQ|5.0|This is Joni Mitchell at her very best in song lyrics and musical talent. Every song is a keeper on this album. Excellant recording levels also!
B001FB4VZS|4.0|I'm a fan of comics period and interested in any attempt to bring the media to the masses.  Smallville brings a story of DC's Superman to the small screen.  Notice I said \\"a story\\" not \\"the story.\\"  It is not but probably 75 to 80 percent loyal to the comicbook story.  Glad to see the character's of Clark and Lois meshing closer and the removal of Launa--I was getting tired of the Clark and Launa drama of earlier seasons!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|It picks up a lot of the stuff on the floor, charges up fast, and is light and easy to use. It will last about three years (with frequent use).  It is not expensive.
B000002B2T|5.0|I heard \\"River of Deceit\\" on Pandora and liked it.  After recieving the album, I loved it all!  The song that stands out the most to me is \\"Artificial Red.\\"  The whole album has a very blues feel very similar to the feel of the Alice In Chains Jar of Flies album.  \\"Above\\" is an album you must own!
1560100842|4.0|You'll get to learn all about creating characters the animator way and how to animate them.  To some people out there you might think these character designs are out of date, but they aren't; drawing the way he teaches you will help you construct your own characters in a much more solid way.  The animation techniques included are the basic, they are good but you'll find them much more updated and efficient in Richard Williams' \\"The Animator Survival Kit\\".  I still recommend reading the whole book, it's great.
0375413405|5.0|The movie stimulates new interest in this book and for good reason.  This is a book worthy of your library....and time.  I give this as a gift many times; nice to find a good price on a hardback, as I don't care to give paperback books as gifts.  The quality of content speaks for itself.  If you don't own this book, you need to.  It is the basis of all good cookery; and if you never cook from it....it is at least a good read.
0571202284|5.0|This is by far the most complete ANIMATION book.  Many new books have used concepts of this book to explain the fundamentals of animation, so why get those books when you can get the original source?<br />It covers ALL, the examples are clean and clear, surely the best book I've bought for animation.<br /><br />BTW, yes, Richard William is mad, he goes through every concept so thoroughly and methodically , getting the best out of each movement.  You should really see how does details really boost the quality in the animation.  Also, his DVD's are great too, highly recommended for anyone out there!
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is a huge Harry Potter fan.  Needless to say, she loved it!
0451230620|4.0|In the history of good books, people have created good movies using the books title (but have nothing really to do with the book).  BLADE RUNNER and DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP is a good example of this.  RUNNING MAN is another fine example of this.  When I was a teenage, I loved the Arnold movie.  Now that I am way past a teenager, I decided to read the source material.  I was shocked and thrilled that I stepped into almost an entirely different world.<br /><br />The Ben Richards of the novel is not a criminal, fabricated or otherwise.  The Ben Richards in the novel is a desperate man trying to find a solution to a nightmare many fathers face.  Richards is a character in this book faces a far greater challenge than that of the movie.  The game arena is the USA.  The foes are the good people of the United States of America.  In this Dystopia, Richards finds himself struggle to find commrades and figuring out who to trust.<br /><br />To give too much away would tell major parts of the book.  Don't read this book expecting an action adventure film.  Read this book expecting a character study of a man who would do anything for those he loves.  The writing is not King's best, I thought some of it was a little unbalanced, but the story is captivating.
B001UV4XX8|4.0|I'm going to keep this review short and sweet, as I feel other 4-star reviews have made any point I could make already.<br /><br />This movie was nothing if not interesting and mind-boggling. It kept me guessing and in the end...I couldn't stop thinking about what I'd just witnessed and how much I want to see it again so I can study it further.<br /><br />No, it was not the best sci-fi film ever...not even the best by the director, Richard Kelly. But, what it was is an engrossing, interesting, and (although it was based on a short story and Twilight Zone episode) original film, produced in an era where run-of-the-mill actions and romantic comedies rule the screen. And the acting wasn't too shabby either. Cameron Diaz's fake Southern accent could be a little much at times, but I think that was the intention. And Frank Langella was phenomenal.<br /><br />Plain and simply, rent this before you buy it. It is a movie you'll likely either 'get' or loathe ravenously. But you should at least give it a chance. Yes, the plot is a bit incoherent at times, but it's not supposed to be an easy movie...it's cerebral and visual. It makes you think.<br /><br />I'll be adding it to my blu-ray collection for sure, as I already have Kelly's other 2 films, Donnie Darko and Southland Tales.

0618918248|5.0|I recently read the paperback version of Dawkins' most notorious book. It is a great piece of critical insight into many questions that religion finds itself incapable of answering. Though Dawkins is one of the \\"Four Horsemen\\" of atheism, he has his own special critique of religion, just as Dennett, Harris, and Hitchens all tackle the issue in their distinct way. Dawkins comes from a highly scientific professional background and his focus on what's knowable and realistically possible in the conversation is essential. He raises many important questions that, as a former believer, I was struck that I didn't at least think of a few of them. Several of his criticisms are so simple yet so elegant, and his deconstruction of the embarrassing Pascal's Wager argument is my favorite of all such criticisms I've heard offered.    Dawkins wasn't instrumental in my dropping my former Roman Catholic beliefs, but his book is a unique pearl of wisdom that codifies more important questions and arguments I hadn't even considered, and some that I didn't even know but now do. I also appreciate Dawkins' fearless challenging of religious figures (outside of this book) such as that awful sham Ted Haggard, and his public challenging of religious leaders in televised forums. He's not so eloquent as Hitchens, but he has a lot to say and good ways of saying it.    I heartily recommend this book to anyone, and especially to those who think their faith is rock solid.
1591840562|3.0|If you are starting a company or work for a start-up, then this is worh the read for inspiration and a flavor of the start-up world.    I don't classify the author as a real expert on eveything he writes about, but there's enough useful data to keep your interest. Probably useful data, although he doesn't really have the experience in what he's writing about.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|Have always loved this film in black and white and now love it more in color version
B002SJIO5E|5.0|When I first started watching this movie I wasn't too excited. Some of these so called documentary-like are not to my taste. But as the plot developed I really got into it. The movie had a lot depth and demonstrated a lot of layers of human condition. A lot of questions asked... and special effects just excellent. Highly recommend this one.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I love this movie, it is sad but beautiful and just long enough to keep my toddler entertained!
1416594787|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />\\"One of the truly bad effects of religion is that it teaches us that it is a virtue to be satisfied with not understanding...If you don't understand how something works, never mind: just give up and say God did it.\\" (from the bestselling book \\"The God Delusion,\\" 2006)<br /><br />Don't worry!!  This book, \\"The Greatest Show on Earth,\\" is a book of understanding and...evidence (lots and lots of evidence).  This book was written by Richard Dawkins.<br /><br />Dawkins is a biological theorist and scientist (ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and sociobiologist).  He is a popular science author focusing on evolution.  (He also wrote the bestseller mentioned above.)  Dawkins retired from Oxford University in 2008 but remains a writer and public figure.<br /><br />Where did the title of this book come from?  Years ago an anonymous well-wisher had sent Dawkins a T-shirt with the words: \\"Evolution, the Greatest Show on Earth, the Only Game in Town.\\"  From this slogan, he found his title. (I'd like to get myself one of these T-shirts.)<br /><br />Why was this book written?  All Dawkins' previous works dealing with evolution (as first proposed by Charles Darwin in his scientific masterpiece \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" 1859) had simply assumed its truth and had not explicitly provided the evidence for it.  Thus, this book was written to fill that gap.<br /><br />It seems to me that Dawkins also wrote this book to honour Charles Darwin (1809 to 1882).  It is no accident that this book has thirteen chapters.  Darwin's 1859 masterpiece was fourteen chapters long but it's the first thirteen chapters that are the explanatory chapters with the last chapter being entitled \\"Recapitulation and Conclusion.\\"<br /><br />From the point of view of modern intellectual life and culture, \\"On the Origin of Species\\" is one of the most important scientific books of all time.  It evoked a storm of controversy when it was first published and initiated a revolution in our thinking that continues to this very day.  Darwin's book deserves to be more widely read, and, importantly, better understood.  However, it can be a dense and for many, a difficult read.  As well, some of the evidence is sparse.  For these reasons, understanding may be lost.<br /><br />Enter Dawkins' book (published on the 200TH year of Darwin's birth and 150TH anniversary of Darwin's masterpiece).  It explains in modern and lucid language how Darwin's theory of Evolution by Natural Selection works.  If you did not understand this theory before, I'll guarantee you'll understand it thoroughly after reading this book.<br /><br />A hallmark of this book is that it expands the evidence for biological evolution. All this evidence makes it quite clear that this theory can now be regarded unequivocally as fact.<br /><br />Another hallmark of this book is that it corrects the many, many erroneous interpretations of Darwin's work (brought about by those who don't understand or have twisted what Darwin has said).  For example, we're constantly told that humans are descended from monkeys.  Right?  WRONG!!  As Dawkins tells us, \\"We share a common ancestor with monkeys.\\"<br /><br />This book has generated controversy because some say it puts down creationists.  NO.  What Dawkins does is to explain some evidence for evolution and occasionally asks how it is possible that creationists can believe otherwise.  (Note that Darwin also does this in his 1859 book but he had to be careful because the social culture of his time was soaked in supernaturalism.  This may have been one of the reasons he delayed publication of his book for twenty years.)  Richard Dawkins then dissects their belief showing how it is blatantly false.<br /><br />My favourite chapter is the last one.  Here Dawkins examines \\"line by line\\" the very last two long sentences in Darwin's 1859 book.  For me, this last chapter was a joy to read!<br /><br />Unlike Darwin's 1859 book, Dawkins' book contains many black and white illustrations throughout.  What I found particularly impressive were the four sets of colour photographs that were also included.  There are 32 colour photos in total.<br /><br />Finally, and I said this for \\"The God Delusion,\\" this book is long.  This by itself is not a problem but those who should read this book from cover to cover will be deterred by its length.  This is a pity.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is truly a remarkable book, a tribute both to Charles Darwin and his 1859 classic, explaining and showing that evolution is indeed \\"the greatest show on Earth, the only game in town.\\"  I leave you with the very last sentence of Charles Darwin's 1859 classic and a sentence Richard Dawkins analyses in the last chapter of his book:<br /><br />\\"There is grandeur in this view of life [that is, grandeur in the laws of nature], with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms [of life] or into one [form of life]; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\"<br /><br />(first published in 2009;  preface;  13 chapters;  main narrative 425 pages;  appendix;  notes;  bibliography;  picture acknowledgements;  index)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXtrations throughout.

B000NQI4CM|5.0|Now seventeen years old, this remarkable novel is by Vikram Seth, who though not very prolific, always hits the highest notes with his work. This is his masterpiece....probably the longest book I've read, 1,349 pages, and the one I hated most to end.  Set in the India of the early 1950,s against the political and religious upheavals of that time (Partition), it is a simple family story about one widow's odyssey through India to find a \\"suitable boy\\" for her youngest daughter.  Through this very intimate story, we meet aqppealing characters, richly evoked settings and a panorammic view of India, its customs and history at that time. The author is finally writing a sequel to this beloved work, which he says will be called A Suitable Girl, and will come out in a couple of years.  It is in anticipation of this event that I found a beautiful used hard-back copy of the original at one of Amazon's sellers,  which I may now read and enjoy again. For those who have not yet read this wonderful book, I envy you the pleasure you have in store.  P. Blake, Chicago IL

I bought for myself and for my step-father. and we both agree. This truly is the GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|My daughter (8) and I had never seen this movie or read the book, so we were not sure what to expect.  This movie is action packed from beginning to end.  We loved it!  She even told me when the movie was over that she would like to read the book.  To the library we go.

0812973992|3.0|Colum Mccann's novel is lyrical staccato with nifty observations and interesting characters.  Like some other \\"novels\\" today, Let the Great World Spin is more like a collection of short stories linked together by some type of device.    McCann's tapestry takes us through the sights and smells of 1970's New York City.  A collection of junkies, immigrants, judges, artists and prostitutes make their way through the garbage and danger of Manhattan, while, high above it all, a mysterious acrobat walks a tightrope between the World Trade Center Towers.    The stories intersect personally with two tragedies: the Vietnam conflict and an terrible car accident.  The latter brings to mind the narrative fulcrum of the movie Crash.  However, it is the living and breathing metaphor of the tightrope walker that gives the story its momentum and its real axis.      After a bravura opening that has almost the whole city stopping to observe a little speck walking out into the air between the towers, the novel suddenly shifts almost dizzily to Dublin - years earlier. Then, it fast forwards again and settles down into its gritty New York landscape and doesn't relent for a while.   Indeed, McCann rubs our nose in the sights sounds and temperature of the tenements and their denizens with a kind of sadistic delight; things become very observational, and it is hard to get a read on what the characters want or desire.  Here is where I felt the work stumbled.     This part of the book becomes a little bit of a slog. I put it down quite a bit and found I wouldn't pick it up for a while.  I mention this only to assure readers that the novel does, in fact, pick up at around the half-way point.  Every snapshot of the acrobat brings us closer and closer to him as the narrative and story lines begin to come together  - the writer is back in command of his work again.     McCann employs a nice lyrical quality in some of the simple, sometimes sad, observations of his characters - some of whom do havethat grating quality of over-characterization. (Hey, the prostitute knows poetry!) And in the end there is transcendent resonance between the artistry of the acrobat and way the love of human beings for one another can imbue moments with lasting significance.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Wow, this is one of the few series where every major player in it just...fits. I love this series and can't wait to grab season 2 when it eventually comes out. I'm a little sad that it probably won't last long, but then, nothing good ever does.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I and many other car guys have watched this one with subtle enjoyment. There are plenty of little car related gags in the film that are lots of fun to notice when they come up. You can get this one for the kids, and you can enjoy it for yourself too.
B0018S6YO4|5.0|This CD is loaded with 'Hits', one after the other. Everyone in the family is a fan of hers. From age 25 to 60!
B000W07EKW|4.0|I gave this set to my husband for Christmas. As a family, we really enjoyed watching all three movies on three consecutive days. We had all seen them before, however, viewed in this manner it was a different experience. Matt Damon's masterful portrayal of Jason Bourne can be fully appreciated. I highly recommend this set.

B001GM28HO|5.0|I got The Fame Monster for Christmas and ordered The Fame for myself so I could have the rest of Lady Gaga's music. As soon as it was delivered, I opened up my new cd and found BOTH The Fame + Fame Monster packed inside! The Fame Monster was disk 1. That was a surprise, but totally welcome. I love Gaga, and if you like her singles, I'm sure you'll like the rest of her tracks as well.

B00168OIOE|5.0|Just a great fun film to watch. I never saw it in the theaters but after seeing it for the first time on cable I thought it was great. I still check it out often when I have the itch to watch something that's a bit light, and funny.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I've been watching Dexter from it's beginning and am NEVER let down. I loved the cast on the show Six Feet Under, when I first saw Michael C. Hall. He's believable, LIKEABLE, and I find myself caring about him, not wanting him to get caught.  Strange, being he's a serial killer!  I watched Season 3 just as I watched Season 2; 'til the sun came up.  Yes, I watched it non-stop, and you will, too!  Can hardly wait for Season 4.  Since I'm not a subscriber of Showtime, I have to wait to watch it when the DVD comes out to purchase.  Most likely it will be through Amazon.com
1439110123|5.0|Especially for history buffs this is the best book around for the complete history of oil and oil companies and how it has shaped the modern world.  The industrial revolution would have run out of steam if it weren't for oil (and the gas that comes with it).  This is a very well written book.  Its a long book, but necessary to be so complete and give such a thorough view of how oil has changed our lives and economy.  Excellent book if you want to see how our world got to be like it is.
B0017APPSO|5.0|The animation is superb, and the characters are rich and exciting. A great story line of a girls journey from one culture to another and growing up whilst doing it.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|The Whitman brothers haven't seen each other in years. After their father dies, Francis (Owen Wilson) organizes a trip for them to reconnect on a spiritual tour of India. So Jack (Jason Schwartzman, also acting as co-writer with director Wes Anderson) leaves behind the hotel room he's been living at for months in France and his neurotic girlfriend (Natalie Portman), and Peter (Adrien Brody) leaves his pregnant wife behind for the spiritual \\"retreat.\\" Traveling around India on The Darjeeling Limited the three brothers try to find themselves, each other, and possibly their long lost mother (Anjelica Huston).    Wes Anderson is the king of quirky indie style comedies. Before the indie movie scene was \\"cool\\", Anderson was making movies like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. Often copied but never duplicated (the closest being Anderson protege Noah Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale), one of the things that makes Anderson's movies so great is his ability to walk that fine line between depressing and funny, and pathetic and sweet. Writing satirical stories about dysfunctional relationships, neurotic individuals, and upperclass families unhinged from reality, Anderson has definitely carved himself a unique niche with the film world. So how does this film stand up against Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tennenbaums, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou?    In all honesty, and this might be hard to believe, I think this is Anderson's best movie to date (I should say the best Anderson movie I've seen since I still have yet to see Fantastic Mr. Fox). By shooting this film in India, he gives this film a unique flavor from the rest of his films, while still seeming familiar at the same time. Of course, that familiarity can be attributed to Anderson's use of many of the same actors as he's used in his other films (of the American actors in the film, only Adrien Brody hasn't appeared in a Wes Anderson film), not to mention the familiar subject material from his previous movies. Thesmaller sets, and closer proximity of the characters, as well as the smaller cast also make this movie feel more personal and allowing you to get closer to the characters. One thing that I've noticed in a lot of indie films these days is giving characters quirks that don't really define the characters but are there just to set the movie apart from the mainstream. Here, Anderson's characters have quirks, but the quirks are defined by the characters relationships and who they are rather than the other way around. Throughout the movie we see Wilson's character with bandages covering a large portion of his head and face, it seems like it's just a quirk the writers threw in to make the character seem more interesting, but when you find out the truth, it makes complete since in the scheme of who the character is.    As with any Anderson movie the acting is impeccable, and adding Oscar winner Adrien Brody to his film making \\"family\\" was an inspired choice. Each of the actors playing the brother is completely believable in his spot in the pecking order. Wilson as the oldest, and as the one who practically raised the other brothers, is authoritative to a fault and tries to hide a more emotional interior from his \\"frailer\\" brothers. Brody plays the middle brother who sometimes feels like he's fading stuck between the other two and tries to break out of the mold by taking things important to others to find an identity and at times rebels against his older brother. Schwartzman, as the younger brother, is the impressionable one but just kind of wants to go with the flow of what the other brothers are doing. Each actor exemplifies these roles to a tee, but the real standout is Wilson. Unfortunately, as we found out later, his character may have been a little closer to his reality then we'd like to have thought.    If I had one problem with this movie it's that I don't get the use of Bill Murray as The Businessman with just one line. I guess had it been a no name actor I probablywouldn't have even thought about this point, and Anderson might have chosen to put Murray into this role because Murray's become something of a talisman to him since he has appeared in all of Anderson's movies except for Bottle Rocket. Still, because of Murray's involvement I kept thinking there was going to be something more to the movie that never came about. Due to this distraction from the rest of the movie, I find the role actually to be somewhat detrimental to the movie as it really serves no purpose in the grand scheme of things.    I highly recommend that you give this movie a try, especially if you like Anderson's previously efforts or other independent film. As with all of his movies this is kind of a love it or hate it affair, but there's a lot to like about this movie from the look at a different culture, to the acting, to an interesting and engrossing story. Also if you check out the DVD make sure you watch the short film before The Darjeeling Limited called Hotel Chevalier.    4.5/5
B002TUETW4|5.0|I have this CD and the DVD.<br />Both are extremely awesome.<br />But this review is about the cd<br /> what i have to say about the cd is all of the songs are awesome, i love the included demos and the poem, \\"Planet Earth\\", and the remastered versions are awesome. Pretty much this CD is awesome. it even includes pictures from the This is It rehearsal; thats awesome.<br />the only flaw i have about this cd is that it isn't the exact same versions from the movie. If you have the This is It on DVD or have seen it in the theater like me, you will understand that the songs are not the same versions like the ones on the dvd. Good examples are: They Don't Care About Us, Human Nature, The Way You Make Me Feel and others.....the songs are basically the remastered versions on his regular albums, but not really the actual songs recorded during the rehearsal for This is It. It also didn't include the Jackson 5 songs that MJ sang which is featured on the movie. Michael sings I Want You Back, The Love YoU Save and I'll Be There and those weren't included on the Cd.<br />Other than that,this Cd is great. A must-have for any Michael Jackson fan. I love this CD I listen to it every day in the car and the flaws I pointed out, really aren't that big and they barely matter - this CD is great!<br />I highly recommend buying the DVd!<br />RIP Michael Jackson
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I went into this film with relatively low expectations. Not that I thought it would be bad, but well, what can you do with a movie that has an octogenarian as it's main character? It turns out, plenty.     The movie sweeps through childhood innocence, heartbreak, loneliness and much of the same type of humor that is typical in a Pixar film. I personally think this is my favorite film from Pixar, and one of the better animated films I have seen. Period. If you haven't seen it, you won't regret it.
0307408833|4.0|I purchased this cookbook for my daughter and granddaughter who are gluten intolerant. We ran out of time and didn't get anything made out of it so I can't speak to the flavor of the recipes when made. The book came promptly and was in the condition it was to be in. I was happy with the purchase and my daughter was excited about the cookbook.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|The videos are exactly as they are presented.  For the price they were excellent.  Much cheaper than the box set.  You get exactly the way it is presented: four movies recorded on two discs (one movie on each side).  They come with character interviews and notes.  Was really cool to watch all three movies back to back to easily follow the full story line.  Definitely a good buy.
B002RSDW8A|5.0|I have no idea why the critics panned JULIE & JULIA.  My husband and I saw it the other evening, and found it to be absolutely delightful.  In fact, it was one of the best movies we've seen in a long time.  But be forewarned.  You will be very hungry by the end of JULIE & JULIA.  You will want something to eat, preferably, something with lots of butter.<br /><br />JULIE & JULIA is actually two stories, expertly blended together, each complimenting the other, and creating dish that is more than the sum of its ingredients<br /><br />The first story told in JULIE & JULIA is the delicious present day story of Julia Powell, a young woman who feels that her life is going nowhere, especially when she compares herself to her high-powered friends.  Julie really wants to make a name for herself as a writer, but instead is a low level administrator who answers the phone all day long, receiving complaints and sob stories.  Jealousy and frustration with her life really come to the forefront when she finds out that one of her less talented, but high flying friends is writing an internet blog about her own life that people seem to be reading.  So Julie decides to give herself a challenge:  She will take one year and cook her way through Julia Child's famous cookbook.  As she goes, she will blog about it - 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Kitchen.  At first, the only reader seems to be her mother, who is extremely less than supporting.  But, along the way, she garners a world of fans and supporters all cheering her on to complete her goal.<br /><br />JULIE & JULIA's second story is that of Julia Child herself:  her life abroad with her beloved and loving husband, her search for herself, her journey through French cooking school, her desire but inability to have a child, her cookbook, and her television show.  This is a touching, tender love story - Julia's love for her husband, her love of food and cooking, and her love of life.  Never one to let obstacles get in her way, Julia lives her life to the fullest with great gusto, enthusiasm, and love.<br /><br />These two stories in JULIE & JULIA are artfully blended together, with Julie's present day scenes intermingling with Julia's from the 1940's.  Most of the time, the lives of these two women seem to mirror each other, making both stories even more connected and meaningful.  The acting by Amy Adams (as Julie) and Stanley Tucci (as Julia's husband Paul) is outstanding and memorable, but it is Meryl Streep as Julia Child who brilliantly steals the show.  After we watched JULIE & JULIA, my husband found all of Julia Child's cooking shows available on PBS.  We have watched several, and Ms. Streep perfectly portrayed Ms. Child to a tee.  Her performance, in a word, is brilliant.<br /><br />JULIE & JULIA is a charming, relaxing, engaging film, just right for a warm, cuddly evening at home.  It will also make you want to eat, and perhaps, it will inspire you to cook.  It did me.  Bon Apetit!great gusto, enthusiasm, and love.

B000RIWAYY|5.0|Being a Satriani's fan since I was a high school student, this one was a must and recently added CD+DVD to my collection.  You will heard a better volume level than the old and previous releases.  Those classic satch's songs, the amazing \\"Surfing with the alien\\", \\"Always with me...\\", \\"Echo\\", sounds so great, more than words can say!!   The DVD is a never seen before live performing from the Montreaux Jazz Festival 1988.  With the Stuart Hamm partnership on the bass, you delight a excellent quality of image and sound that only a very good work like this can brings to you. It will take you back there. The songs performed by Joe and Stuart would sound as never and you would notice that the \\"master\\" continues performing equal or better than in his beginnings.   As I said before, this Legacy is a must!!

0061719544|5.0|A very well written autobiography.  He seems to be a self depreciating man who does not want to believe his fans and friends.  In fact he is a genius who could easily follow in the footsteps of Johnny Carson.
0736063684|5.0|I was referred to this book because it is used by many physiology/exercise/health students at my university.  Am glad I bought it.  The muscle graphics are excellently done.  It is very clear which muscles are being worked by the various exercises.  What I like most about the book is it presents a few exercises for each muscle group versus some books that present 50 exercises for each muscle group.  Having so many excercises can be overwhelming to those new to working out.  This is an well written and presented book for body building.
B000063DFQ|5.0|There isn't a poor track on this album and the songwriting skills (and especially Mr. Harris' playing) were in top form! Steve's lines are truly amazing, as are the excellent guitarists. Last album that you really care to hear Bruce Dickinson's vocals, as they pretty much SUCK after this album.    Such an excellent release it is, which is, of course, why Dream Theater covered a track off it.

006097625X|4.0|Scott McCloud has written a 216 page comic book to explain comic books. The artwork, language, humor or social criticism of comics are obvious to most comics readers, but McCloud delves deeply into the underpinnings of this world--the technical, invisible paradigm that supports the creation and consumption of comics.<br /><br />Understanding Comics is a comic appreciation book. I was impressed with McCloud's grasp of the discipline's history, the psychology of the art and his own creativity when explaining his topic. For me, entering into this paradigm was very much like Thomas Kuhn discovering paradigms, when he said, \\"The scales have fallen from my eyes.\\"<br /><br />Those familiar with comics have recommended a couple of alternatives in their reviews, but still end up suggesting that this book deserves a place among the serious works about comics.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|My x41s have worked great and been hassle free. No glitches, popping, echo, voice coms are fine....maybe not quite as clear as before but still eligible and I can monitor my own voice, which keeps these very \\"wife/girlfriend\\" friendly.    Just wanted to make 3 points.    1) I hate ipods. They sound like poo. Running an ipod through these puppies though is quite pleasant, and the prologic 2 makes the tinny-squeaky apple fashion gimmicks sound OK. Sure its coloured sound but the optional extra bass will keep doof-doof music lovers happy.  (but you still want a better player- ipods are for mugs)    2) The endless techno/audiophile war continues with the heresy of suggesting 7.1 is possible on headphones. Frankly I say WHATEVER! These sound great...whether the gizmo manages to pull off the surround effect with psychoacoustics or notch-filters doesn't matter, the surround WORKS! To put it in context, I have been playing a 360 running some old seinnheiser(sp?) earphones that allow me to wear the headset on top as they didn't noise cancel and were fairly flush. This gave a really good stereo image and allowed for good location of sounds, but was a little awkward. The x41s give enough detail to totally pinpoint the sound in relation to yourself accurately enough for even a lagging, lame non-sniper like myself to pop up and get multiple snap headshots on mw2 on first use, guided almost entirely by just the sound. The sound is VERY detailed, at times overwhelmingly so. It won't make you an Uber Gamer (they're all called Gerald anyway)but it will make your games more immersive, and gets you a little more \\"in the zone\\"...nuff said.    3) You don't need these...no one does. They are really an indulgence, justified only by fairly flimsy excuses to those who share your bank account. But at the moment they are THE Rolls Royce of gaming headphones for the 360.     I'm not sure whether Turtle Beach has ironed out any previous x41 issues but I have had none. Setting up was easy.   N.B. if you are running HDMI you may need to remove the grey plastic end on your 360 AV lead with the optical port on it as it is bulky and obscures the HDMI port...or buy a lead adapter off ebay as the official ones are costly...blame microsoft for this bit of cr@p design.    To summarize: Goregeous, but minus 1 star for being just a little too expensive... (but certainly worth saving the extra to get a set rather than the x31s)  Happy to answer questions in the comments..
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I thought the cast was well chosen for Spock especially.  James T. Kirk,  Doctor McCoy and Scotty were easily identifiable.  Urura not so, but she looked good in the part.  Anxiously wait for Star Trek II to be released.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Absolutely Wonderful film!  Being introduced to the original crew of the Enterprise, before it's maiden voyage was a thrill and an honor!  The actors ALL nailed the exact personalities of the crew members we all grew up with and love.  My favorite , has to be Dr. Leonard McCoy.......perfect reprisal of a very popular character.  The storyline IS brilliant, in as it works to create an entirely new timeline for the story to continue, without interfering with the history of the original voyages of the U.S.S. Enterprise.  This blu-ray version is beautiful to watch over and over again.

B002ZG997M|5.0|Excellent action movie with great fight scenes. Denzel was an awesome monk warrior and Mila Kunis was a babe not to be trifled with. The evil boss and his head crony were also well casted. The music and the way this movie was filmed gave it an epic feeling to it, but the story is too one dimensional to be deserving of an epic categorization. To give you an example, the entire movie was probably filmed at no more than ten different locations because that's all it really needed. I thought the ending was good because it was a surprise, but I probably would have preferred a final action scene that left the streets bloody.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|the product arrived way before the deadline in perfect condition, I would say NEW or like new.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I'm very happy with this Sony turntable. It may not have the sound quality or metal construction of some of the professional options out there, but it's a perfectly good turntable for home use. I like the fact that the tone arm moves automatically so that I can just put a record on the platter, close the lid and hit start. The pre-amp is perfectly good for my setup and I'm very happy with the sound quality. I haven't tried the USB ripping feature so I can't comment on that but I think this is a great turntable for the price.
B001PA0FFO|2.0|I know this movie is supposed to be about subtlety, and how paranoia can overtake someone's mind, and I appreciate those aspects of the film. My complaint is that it was slow, there wasn't much dialogue, and at times it was just dull.
0786868724|5.0|\\"Will you do my eulogy?\\"  Thus begins, Mitch Albom's new book \\"Have a Little Faith.\\" It is a compilation of the eight-year journey from this conversation to the moment of his Rabbi's funeral in which the author gave the eulogy. Written in a collection of short essays, this insightful book follows Mitch through his process as he gets to know his childhood spiritual leader as not only a cleric, but also as a man, a husband, father, neighbor and friend. Through the process Mitch Albom, author of \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", documents his thoughts and spiritual growth over the years of meetings with Reb, his nickname for Rabbi Albert Lewis. The topics of conversation range from heaven, forgiveness, God, judging others, marriage, wealth, living in community, the life of congregations, family, and many more.  Parallel to these conversations, sermons and the reflections upon them, Mitch tells about a man on the run from drug dealers in the streets of Brooklyn-- one begging to Jesus for help and salvation. How the lives of these two very different men will come together is a mystery for most of the book. In the end, however, the connections become clear as a direct reflection of the author's personal growth and openness in response to the \\"continuing religious education\\" he is participating in as he prepares for his dear Rabbi's passing.

B000ZELISO|1.0|I really hope the writer of this movie is ashamed of him or herself.  This was the poorest movie of the Harry Potter series thus far.  It would seem to me that anyone giving this movie higher than a 3 star rating did not read the book.  I feel bad for J.K Rowling that this great book was made into such a travesty of a movie.  It's an embarassment.  Too bad the writer didn't spend more time writing things into the movie that happened in the book rather than writing things out.  I would say that if you read the book, just be prepared to be let down.  Even if I hadn't read the book, I think I would still only give it about 3 starts.  I purchased the Blu-ray set with the digital copy and I dislike the movie so much that I don't think I will even download the free digital copy.  Such a waste.  All I can say to the writer is...What in the world were you thinking and shame on you.  To J.K. Rowling, my sympathy.
1400032717|4.0|Really well done involving story. Suitable for any age group. Anyone who deals with autistic/Aspergers or other perception \\"disorders\\" would find this interesting and valuable.
0312370849|5.0|Just finished this book last night and I loved it. I enjoyed the way it was written and I loved the way it depicted the French as the introverts that they are. I loved the character of Edouard and how he was developed at the end of the novel.   I tend to enjoy dual-told stories, especially ones about the holocaust and other historical events.   I could not put this book down until it was finished. The author has managed to create two fabulous stories and wrap them up in one breathtaking book.
B002VWNICW|5.0|This film is a favorite of my wife and I; we have watched it several times in DVD format and thought it looked pretty good. I bought the Blu-ray version as soon as it was released and compared it to the DVD on our HDTV. What a difference! The BD is a huge improvement (as it should be) and has made this fine movie just that much better!
B00003CXC7|5.0|It may be open to question whether 'Rear Window' (1954) is a better movie than 'On The Waterfront' (winner of 1954 Best Picture Oscar), but what cannot be denied is the fact that 'Rear Window' is an Oscar grade material. It is superb story unfolding details of a murder of a wife by her husband in parallel with unfolding of a romantic and passionate relationship of another budding couple. Yes, James Stewart looks too old to be a bachelor photographer but that could not rob him and the screen of his charming personality. Stewart and Kelly looks at the different tenants of the apartment complex and finds in them one of the possibility of their own relationship - boy leaves girl alone, boy without a lady, married couple but with little match, happily married or at the bottom of a relationship so as to kill the wife. Stewart/Kelly pursues the worst combination but comes out - expectantly - as the best one. These two opposite threads run throughout the film to finish with a very subtle and beautiful ending, marking Hitchcock's mastery of story telling. One of my all time favorite.
B000VD5I94|3.0|For this review I rated the video quality instead of the movie itself. Most of you have already seen Robocop and and loved it which is why your reading this review wondering if you should buy the blu-ray. My answer to that question is Yes. Of course it being a older movie its not going to look as great as \\"the incredible hulk\\" or \\"Batman: the dark kngiht\\" but I was surprised to see that it is a brighter and clearer presentation that I have ever seen this movie. While watching the movie I was looking at his armor realizing details I had not noticed before. So whether you have or have not seen this movie before, at this price I would say its one you should pick up.
B000683VI4|5.0|Husbands, this movie along with a glass or two of good Merlot is all you need to score well tonight and probably for the next week. Yeah, she'll be sobbing at the end of the movie, but once she's done you'll achieve two accomplishments: 1) She'll give you great love for the next several days and 2) You'll be able to buy that new shotgun, motorcycle, or boat that she's been reluctant to release the funds for. This movie has a magical way of loosening up the purse strings for nondiscretionary spending.

B002ZIAC26|4.0|Two years after their breakout record, Devotion, Beach House is back, this time with Sub Pop Records and producer Chris Coady who has worked with the likes of TV on the Radio, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and We Are Scientists. Recorded in a church, natural reverb is a pleasant commonality that blends perfectly with Victoria Legrand's peaceful vocals and Alex Scally's shimmering instrumentation.<br /><br />On October 21, 2008, less than a year after Devotion hit the shelves, Beach House released the single \\"Used to Be\\" which now appears on Teen Dream. Although a strong track and one of the catchiest on the album, Beach House displays a new level of originality with the remainder of their third offering.<br /><br />Opening with \\"Zebra,\\" an acoustically driven track reminiscent of Fleet Foxes' critically acclaimed debut, Beach House explore the depths of their new found recording space with a simplistic beauty that sets the tone for the album. The following song, \\"Silver Soul,\\" makes use of the same reverb while tastefully adding more digital effects to the mix which are found throughout the remainder of Teen Dream.<br /><br />Creativity hits its peak on \\"Norway\\", a rhythmic song that opens very similarly to Charlotte Gainsbourg's IRM. With a pitch bend wheel continuously at hand, the melody holds steady in the vocals while the instrumentation wavers around the intended pitch. Albeit difficult to listen to at first, on further listens, the brilliance of the idea becomes clear and the allure of the track begins to stand out from the rest.<br /><br />The final track on the album, \\"Take Care,\\" does an excellent job of bringing the music full circle and providing the listener with a satisfying fade out conclusion. In a music business driven by the success of singles, Teen Dream is a rare complete work that captures the listener best when heard straight through. With releases like this one, it is unlikely Beach House will ever be playing in large venues or frequently heard on the radio, but word of mouth can be a powerful force and I have no doubt Teen Dream will get many people talking.<br /><br />Similar Artists: PJ Harvey, Cat Power<br /><br />Track Suggestion: Used to Bewerful force and I have no doubt Teen Dream will get many people talking.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|My younger son absolutely loves this movie and our original copy of it was misplaced so he was thrilled to get a new one.  The story is based on true events and is very inspiring - family is important, and respect for oneself and others is, too.  My only complaint is the way Sissy Spacek's character stutters when she talks - I presume the real person the character is based upon did, too, but it gets distracting.  Otherwise, her character is wonderful. Our whole family watches and re-watches this film.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is truly a beautiful movie. The main theme in the movie is that hard work and  faith (in yourself and in your dreams) will take you far in life. It's really unfortunate this movie didn't do better at the box office. I hope that doesn't discourage Disney from releasing more hand-drawn movies. The songs in this movie are pretty good too, though not classics, in my opinion.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|District 9 is what you get when you mix the following films:    Terminator  Independence Day  Aliens  Transformers     And the XBOX hit \\"HALO\\"    there are also a few others that I cannot think of at the moment.    Awesome movie, its a bi polar mix of social commentary, action, drama, adventure, science fiction, etc.  Its a complete genre blender.      This is also one movie, where in my opinion, the special effects are directly on point.    I find that a lot of action movies today with huge SFX, such as  Transformers, hsve action scenes that move way too fast to keep sight on, and they kind of become just a big blur of noise and colors. But maybe thats just me.      I cant wait for \\"District 10\\" to come out.      Best alien costumes/figures since \\"Aliens\\"

Highly recommend if a being wants to elevate their cooking skills.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|Many who watch District 9 are quick to say they did not like the movie.   The reason is simple...   The movie is far from what the average SIFI fan expects. Unlike many movies of the SIFI genre this one is not based on some high tech futuristic journey into the next galaxy. The film bleeds of raw, in your face, realism. Viewers just don't expect an alien movie that takes place in the \\"here and now\\" and not in some distant future. The movie clearly takes viewers by surprise as your local news brings you all the sorted details from the comfort of your living room... Its a wild and entertaining ride.   The movie is a creative masterpiece.  In the opinion of this reviewer District 9 is a \\"must see\\" film.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|I loved this movie. The villian from the future changing the past allows for variance from the Star Trek mythology that so many know so well. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto do an excellent job as Kirk and Spock. All the cast worked well with one another and Eric Bana was an outstanding villian. This was a very good adventure movie and I recommend it highly. Gene Rodenberry would have loved it.

I can't stop listening to this debut and hope there are many, many more to come from this inspiring story.  I have been a fan since I first saw her walk onto the stage at Britain's Got Talent!  Greatest thing I've heard in a long, long time!
B0018M6J90|5.0|This movie is delicious and feminine; May this reviewer recommend it to you as a Valentines gift for a witty and humourous friend? Like the equally excellent \\"Julia\\" (with Annette Benning,) \\"Miss Pettigrew\\" is set in London just before the outbreak of the Second World War, using some of the same locations. Unlike \\"Julia\\" it's humour is sweet-tempered, presenting the sometimes ticklish romantic situations occurring between the sexes with hilarity. All good persons are rewarded in the end and all bad ones left to ponder their trespasses. Frances McDormand is delightful as Guinivere Pettigrew; Amy Adams is perfect as the ambitious \\"dumb blond\\" Delysia LaFosse; handsome Lee Pace is her love and her down fall. Shirley Henderson plays the catty lingerie designer, Edythe DuBarry giving depth to a character that could have been made of cardboard in some one else's hands. The period re-creation is excellent with a great eye for clothing and hair-styles, especially for Miss Adams and Miss Henderson.

0156034565|4.0|A British, totally secular fisheries expert spearheads a sheik's scheme to bring the comforts, and faith, inherent in angling to the desert. This idealism infuses a thoughtful narrative about diplomacy, hope, and fate. Mixing genres, styles, and voices, bureaucrats, lovers, soldiers, politicians, terrorists and pundits jostle in short chapters which construct a light but instructive fable.<br /><br />Torday manages to capture the tone of how a yuppie banker vs. a Scottish local newspaper, an Al-Qaeda operative vs. an extract from \\"Hansard,\\" a scientist's diary vs. a Prime Minister's PR man, would add to the complicated reactions to the sheik's proposal to flood a Yemeni wadi with tanks, sluices, and cooling to support fish imported from Britain. The audacious plan's unfolding leads to the main character, Dr. Alfred Jones, confronting the stagnation of his marriage, the routine of his job, and the contrast between a land where a \\"Sunday ritual\\" means shopping at Tesco's vs. an Arab culture where faith in its simplicity, apart from fanaticism, enriches life and brings solace to a country where the divine religion still allows dignity despite the absence of the fatal faith of the West, the religion of money.<br /><br />I came to this out of its title, and my interest in Yemen. I recommend Tim Mackintosh-Smith's \\"Yemen,\\" (reviewed by me) better called by its British title, \\"Dictionary Land,\\" as a companion to this novel. I know nothing about fishing, but a glossary and a steady stream of subtle explanations allow any reader to follow easily the angling terms and biological data. The shifts between materials and speakers and writers keep the novel moving, if perhaps slightly off-kilter at times.<br /><br />The success of Sheikh Muhammed's project pulls in events as disparate as the war in Iraq, a TV pilot, ecological and fishery activists, Islamic fundamentalists, and the simple, nagging question of how Western and Muslim societies struggle towards common ground in an ancient, humble hobby. The landscape of Yemen does not emerge until nearly two-thirds of the way through, but the novel deepens and widens its scope as we see through English eyes the meaning of what the sheikh has tried to show his skeptical colleagues: \\"Faith comes before hope, and hope before love.\\" This lesson will change more than one life, and alter more than one course, as the novel reaches its conclusion.e landscape of Yemen does not emerge until nearly two-thirds of the way through, but the novel deepens and widens its scope as we see through English eyes the meaning of what the sheikh has tried to show his skeptical colleagues: \\"Faith comes before hope, and hope before love.\\" This lesson will change more than one life, and alter more than one course, as the novel reaches its conclusion.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I can't say that about many movies.  I feel like Keanu Reeves in the Matrix after he chooses the red pill.  My eyes are open now to where all that shiny, cheap food comes from and I can never erase that.  I think the most memorable part for me was when Mr. Salatin observes that we don't necessarily want the cheapest cars but we clamor to buy the cheapest food.  And it goes INTO our bodies.    Not any more.  My family and I are transitioning over to a non-industrialized diet after watching Food, Inc.  This goes beyond buying organic.  With a little searching we found a family farm here in Ventura County that raises their own chickens and hogs.  We only purchase produce from the local farmers markets now as well.  It's hard at first but it gets easier... it just takes a little more planning.  The payoff has been immeasurable in our conscience and our well-being.    Everyone needs to see this movie whatever your political persuasion.  Surely we can agree that clean, safe food is not a liberal or conservative issue.  It's a human issue.

If I tuck it under it works great. My fiance also tried it and he has a large arm and it fit.  So anyone with a normal-large arm it would fit great.

The book takes its climactic moment as Ms. Smith is being scolded by a French women as she stands over the grave of Jim Morrison in the driving rain. \\"'American!\\" she said, \\" Why don't you honor your poets?\\"'  The irony of this moment is delicious as few Americans have honored the spirit of poetry more than Ms. Smith.

Those wishing career retrospectives should look elsewhere.

It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages. I refuse to say anything about the plot, because I don't need to. The plot isn't really what matters in this novel--the insights do. This one is definitely going on my favorites shelf!
0671015206|2.0|This book has a great start but slowly plateaus of useful information.  Would I have bought it and read the book if I knew this?  Yes.  Just beware, the book gets very stale and repetitive in the final third portion.  The book is written concerning conclusions after demographic study of today's wealthy.  CAUTION! This book is ALL about earning and saving $MONEY$.  The two Ph.D.'s who write the book only provide the data which they were paid to collect for the corporations they were tasked to research for.  They present the material in a matter of fact manner where accumulating wealth whatever the cost.  I would be concerned about the relational health of their families.  The book demonstrates the authors' lack of concern to life, health and family in this publication.  These issues have no implied value to these authors.    However; there are some nice lessons to be learned.

B002L3RVCY|5.0|I have always been a Star Wars fan, going back to the original in 1977. When I heard that Lucasfilm was going to do an animated movie and series, I was at first skeptical, because I was so used to the live action and special effects. However, I saw the movie, and have watched every episode of this series, and I have to say that it's actually really good. It's a way to continue the Star Wars saga for those of us who are going through withdrawal from the original and prequel trilogies. Most of the vocal talent is close enough to the real actors to make you forget that they're not the same people, and the storylines are entertaining. Plus, there's some good humor thrown in too, especially from lesser characters and pretty much any droid that appears. For Star Wars and sci-fi enthusiasts, plus anyone who likes good animated series, this series should be added to your collection.
0545123267|5.0|I'd heard this lauded as just the thing for Twilight readers who counted themselves among Team Jacob so I moved this up on \\"high priority\\" on my \\"to read\\" shelf. I have to say, the first several chapters didn't initially rope me in. I stuck with it though, and I'm glad I did as the story quickly changes tone about a quarter of the way through the book.<br /><br />16-year-old Grace is a bit of a loner, in Mercy Falls, Minnesota, with two best friends Olivia and Rachel. Her inattentive and disengaged parents seem happy to let her have the run of the household. Sam is a werewolf, who we soon learn, takes human form during summers and spends his winters as a wolf. All Grace knows (at least, at first) is that she was attacked by wolves as a child, and was saved by one of the pack. Ever since then, she's been fascinated by \\"her\\" wolf, watching and photographing him whenever she can.<br /><br />Writing first-person narrative between two alternating characters can be tricky -- readers could be left struggling, wondering, \\"Now who is this speaking again?\\" but when done well, it's brilliant. Steifvater handles the transitions between viewpoints with aplomb. Each extremely short chapter is clearly marked with a heading of the protagonist that we are hearing from, along with a report of the current temperature (something which really amps up the tension, as temperatures steadily drop and Sam and Grace's fates hang in the balance.) In addition, Sam and Grace each have very distinct voices.<br /><br />The language in this book is rich and lyrical. Once Sam regains human form (after being shot by local hunters), the romantic connection between him and Grace deepens.

B002CXEIAG|4.0|Some reviewers knock the Tudors for not being historically accurate. From a basic fact standpoint, that's untrue. The events, event sequence and characters are all accurate to the historical record. However, like any work of historical fiction, the writer has to fill in blanks where details were simply not recorded by any historian. So what if the King Henry, by season 3, is 80 pounds lighter than what he's supposed to be? Does anyone knock a good Shakespearean actor for being too tall or having the wrong hair color? This is as good a drama as any, with the added benefit that the viewer walks away with a little knowledge of world history. Blu-ray quality is superb, with plenty of scenes (outdoors, gleaming jewels of the court, etc.) to show off the medium.
B002O5M4SA|4.0|It was quiet an experience to watch \\"Leon\\" in this Extended Edition in Blue Ray. A master piece.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I love this CD! All the songs are great performed by really great musicians. Especially Satellite Heart and White Demon. Very appropriate for the movie and yet you don't have to be an immortal (wolf or vampire) to be able to relate to it. I have recommended it to many of my friends and I'll continue to do so. I've had this for more than a month now and I still listen to it everyday. I hope the next Twilight movie comes out with another great soundtrack, this is kinda hard to top off.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|If this movie goes down in price, definitely get it on Blu-Ray. On a regular DVD you'll probably just see better detail and brighter colors. But on the Blu-Ray version I could make out textures on surfaces of the people/surroundings that I never saw before.
B000TERK14|5.0|This is a great album if you already like a couple of 30 Seconds to Mars songs. In my opinion, the sound quality from Amazon MP3s are better than iTunes. Once you download the Amazon MP3 manager, the songs download, then iTunes program on my computer automatically recognizes the new downloads and then all that's left to do is sync the songs to my iPod. Download this album now!
B001QOOCTE|4.0|The CD & DVD Playing for Change is one of the Best. The people that sing and play in the CD and DVD are Very Talented. They also have a great love of music. These talented people are showing that music is but one language. This My Friends is Kick Ass!!!!!
1592332803|5.0|My wife and I have been vegan for about 6 years and have continually broadened our repertoire of tasty vegan meals, but we had struggled to find enough dessert recipes that were as amazing as the main course recipes we had been finding.<br /><br />When we stumbled upon this cookbook, our prayers were answered!  Filled with simple, and more elegant desserts, depending on what suits your fancy, this book has it all.  The recipes are fantastic, the author provides informative sections that discuss ingredients, and lots of helpful tips like how to incorporate egg replacer in a simple way that makes the best chocolate chip cookies ever.<br /><br />My wife is constantly flooded with requests for her chocolate chip cookies from vegans and non-vegans alike who all say they are the best tasting chocolate chip cookies they have ever had.<br /><br />The textbook author also does a weekly podcast that is free that covers topics ranging from vegan cooking/baking, animal welfare, social and historical perspectives on vegan and non-vegan holidays, etc....

0471267554|5.0|Love this book, it's an easy read and I love the recipie section, gives me some ideas, I have already tried a few, really good food !! So far, I can definately say that you do feel really healthy eathing this way, I just have to cut out a bit more chocolate / junk food and I should be dropping the pounds !!

B000059TEP|5.0|Product was in perfect condition and was delivered in timely manner.  Would highly recommend.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|There isn't much not to like even for me, someone who has been a fan from the very first episode. It took me a while to warm up the TNG. Deep Space Nine while not exciting provided some cerebral stimulation typical to Roddenberry's goal. Remember the interview, \\"Wagon Train to the Stars\\". Voyager was OK but too commercial in my estimation. Enterprise was also OK but time slots and cable hurt it from becoming a \\"hit\\".    Back to this review and movie. The movie was Exciting but not gratuitously so right from the first scene. I thought the casting and characterization was excellent. The story line was very interesting with nice explantions for the \\"change\\" in timeline and history. It made it easy to see how they could justify new episodes (Movies) which are not necessarily parallel to the original series. re Noonien Singh Khan. Zachary Quinto is making a huge mistake by not reprising the role of Mr Spock for the next movie. Whoever takes on the role next will hopefully make Leonard Nimoy just as proud and reflective.     I will be looking forward to the next release and as long as the makers follow the original premise and keep it thought provoking and exciting the Star Trek brand will last into many more than the 5 year mission first set out. It gave me chills to hear Nimoy recite the words, \\"Space the final frontier,,,\\". \\"Warp 6 Mr Scott, to anywhere out there...\\"

1423113497|5.0|My son's fifth grade class started reading these in school.  He enjoyed the one book and asked if he could buy it along with the second book, then after reading that one he wanted to continue the series so he has the whole collection.  That isn't where it ends...he really insisted I HAD to read this book so I started reading them and have to say they are very good.  I am truly enjoying them as much as he is.  The only disappointment is the last book is hardcover only.  I've heard rumor their is a soft cover coming out soon.<br />There's mystery and excitement in these books.  My son is learning about the Greek gods and mythology at the same time while having a great time reading these.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|loved chris pines take on kirk great special fx their is only one spock and thats leonard nimoy who gives a great performance liked karl urbans leonard bones mccoy and zoe saldanas uhura loved the romulans from the future especially eric banas nero
B002JVWR4U|5.0|It's unfortuante this show didnt get the ratings it deserved which was mostly due to a poorly chosen timeslot on Fox's behalf. The plot was intriguing and the cast was exceptional. As the story of the Dollhouse and Russum Corp unfolded it took so many unexpected, but welcomed, twists and turns and given mnore time these revelations could have been fleshed out; but at least in being allowed to finish the second season, Joss Whedon was able to tie together loose ands and finish the tale of the Dollhouse. I'm eagerly anticipating season 2. As it stands Dollhouse will be another show cancelled that held the promise of turning from something really good into something great. Thanks, Fox...
B0017SWPXY|1.0|I'm not sure why this book has gotten so many high reviews.  I was bored at about the half way point.  Way too much talk and reference to car racing.  I thought about putting the book down several times but was able to finish it.  I really didn't like the ending either.  The last chapter was a lil much.  This book is not in my top ten or top twenty list.  And I don't see myself recommending it to anyone.
B0026P3G12|5.0|She is inspirational , strong and witty. Susan's time in the spotlight has finally come.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|This is a CD/DVD combination,whats not to like??? One again the young crooner comes thru.When you are finished listening,pop in the DVD and watch a tape of a live performance.You'll understand then why this is a five star showman.Any one who is a Buble fan should have this in their collection.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|Sting proves his versatility yet again with this album.  Although my interests are almost exclusively classical in music, this album crosses over just enough to give it novelty and interest whether you prefer classical, jazz or folk venues.<br /><br />It blends traditional and newer sounds in novel and yet integrated ways.  I will be listening to it at intervals over the year, simply because it is so well done and provides some real artistry, as only Sting can provide.<br /><br />Not just for Christmas, but extra nice if you want to have a more traditional, but laid-back sound.<br /><br />Enjoy and contemplate life.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|What a load of crap! The hypocrite that is pushing this doesn't even believe it enough to reduce his own carbon footprint.  The world would be much better off if this idiot (and those like him) would stop exhaling their CO2 and polluting the atmosphere with their drivel! There is plenty of good, solid science out there to refute the lies presented here.  I am so glad I took time to watch this -- my blood pressure was getting too low -- this helped raise it!
B000MRAAJM|2.0|I am huge fan of Planet Earth. it's my third time buying Planet Earth for different video formats(regular dvd, HD dvd, BlueRay). I am surprised and disappointed on this(blueray)one. the picture on the product review on amazon.com, it shows some of \\"5 disc set\\" cover, but it is actually a 4disc set. and also back cover says video format on this blueray is 1080i instead of 1080P. i bought Planet Earth for HD dvd 2years ago, it was clearly said on back cover that the video format was 1080P. I am very disappointed in purchasing this blue ray from amazon.com, Amazon.com MUST fix all the confusing pictures for the product review and make sure to show on website its video format which is 1080i, and only contains 4 disc. i know there are Planet Eart Blue Ray in 1080P format. I am just wondering if I could find it from this site... Just be careful for what you are getting guys !!!
B00168OIOE|5.0|Movie:  Great fun movie which anybody can watch repeatatively. If you are a animation movie lover.. if you are comedy lover.. you can't miss this movie.    4-Disc pack:  Awesome! Now I own, both Blu-ray and DVD version of this movie. Bonus features are lot: MONSTERS, INC. Ride And Go Seek: Building Monstropolis In Japan Go Behind The Scenes Of The New Attraction In Tokyo Disneyland, Filmmaker's Round Table Filmmakers Reflect On The Creation Of The Film, Audio Commentary, Pixar Fun Factory Tour, Banished Concepts,etc.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Fabulous concert and a fabulous recording.  It is all about the music, not like some other \\"concert\\" DVD's that feature a lot of other non essential footage.
0743581490|5.0|This is absolute heaven, to hear Frank McCourt read his own life story with that glorious accent!  My favorite nonfiction book of all time, and favorite audiobook.    However, BUYER BEWARE;  I ordered the unabridged version, and was sent the abridged version.  When I returned it to Amazon, I only received $1.99 out of my $10.00 purchase price.  So, absolutely have this in your collection; just make sure you get every delicious word in the unabridged format.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|Anyone that likes Michael Jackson should own one of these disks. I loved every minute of it. God Bless you Michael.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This is a great movie!  My 2 and 3 years old both enjoyed it and I must say that I was even able to watch it with them and enjoy it.  The kids laughed the whole movie, which I usually don't hear.    I would recommend for children and adults of any age.
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|Fantastic film.  The beginning of the series.  The sweetest of them all.  And really well done.
B00284BMBM|4.0|The cd's I ordered, arrived in great condition! Loved them, took an extra long time to recieve them though.
B002R68U7K|5.0|I love Britney Spears and every song she has done. This is a great collection of all her top singles. I love the collection!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best novels I have read in a long time.  I'm not sure why it's deemed young adult.  I'm 38 years old and my girlfriends and I can't stop talking about it and the sequel.  I have never read anything by Collins before, but I am now definitely a fan.  This book is a no-brainer - pick it up - you will enjoy it.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|What a surprise!  I have enjoyed this CD more than I thought I would.  Every single song is a hit, as far as I'm concerned.  The evocative instrumentation is superb, the feelings that exude from the vocals is mesmerizing.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
B0026P3G12|4.0|This is a fine example of the powerful voice of this woman; the selection is eclectic, however.  Both my husband and I feel that the price was fair and the quality good; Amazon is our place to go to find what is too difficult to find anywhere else and that \\"works for us\\".  I would recommend this CD to others if asked and I would suggest they buy it, if only as a \\"collector's item\\".  Susan Boyle's voice is wonderful!
B001IF9WK0|1.0|I love James Blunt and, in fact, I already own the original All the Lost Souls CD and his other DVD. I bought this because of the new songs and the DVD of live performances. Unfortunatley, the DVD does not play  on my DVD player, a mojor disappointment. I'm not technical enough to know the reason for this (every other DVD I play on it works) and I have been too lazy to package this back up and send it back for a refund, although that is what I should do.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I was looking forward to this latest in this series.  Was disappointed in the ending of the movie.  Hope they can bring it back into the story.
B00275EGX8|2.0|They should have interviewed real soldiers.  The campaign ad wizards made sure to add in their biased reviews \\"a non-political\\" depiction .........    I recommend \\"Orientalism as a Tool for Colonialism\\", or any book by Norman Finkelstein, Noam Chomsky...etc.
B0026P3G12|5.0|When I first heard this woman sing, and there was no effort or straining to hit the notes, I knew a star was born. I couldn't wait for her album to come out and evidently, neither could my mom and sister. We each bought 3, kept 1 and gave the other 2 to each other for Christmas! The opening and reopening of this CD was wonderful and funny! We are 3 thoughtful women from each all age groups who enjoyed giving and receiving this CD immensely! This album will give you goosebumps it's so good!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This is a classic that every Dickens fan should have.  There are a lot of colorful characters and the story is long, but well worth the effort.  Richly rewarding.
0764207407|5.0|Thank you to Jim Hart at Bethany House for providing my copy of this classic. I couldn't help but wonder how the classic might have been improved.<br /><br />Historical and cultural details and definitions from England's early 1800s, facts about Austen's life that enhance the storyline, as well as many other notations, conveniently interspersed along the side margins make this an easy-to-use tutorial.<br /><br />I suggest that Homeschoolers, students of all ages and stages would benefit by the read or rereading. As a retired high school English teacher, I would chose this edition to teach.
B0026P3G12|3.0|Susan Boyle has a fabulous voice as we all know. This CD seems to run out of gas. As The CD concludes I found myself looking for more. I hope Ms. Boyle resolves her alleged health issues, and does a more fulfilling Album. It would be monumental.
0061478784|5.0|I had no idea that one of my favorite movies was actually based on a young adult novel. The book follows a similar story line, but with the added bonus of more detail about all of the characters. All the great stuff from the movie is there, but it's richer and fuller. A fun and easy read!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I purchased this set as a Christmas present for my husband who is a huge Star Trek TOS fan.  On Christmas morning, when he popped in the first disk of Season 1, we found it would not play and the disk was severely scratched.  We made a claim on Amazon.com that day and we received a full replacement set a few days later and they emailed a prepaid return label for the defective set.  We are very satisfied with Amazon customer service.  This remastered version has vibrant colors, incredible graphics, and does justice to Gene Roddenberry's original vision.  The computer graphics of the outer space shots and external views of the Enterprise are really well done.  My husband loves it and brags to all of his friends what a great wife he has!
B001FB4W16|5.0|Loved this start to this series can't wait to get all the rest as soon as they become available.
0385532458|3.0|This set of short stories were both imaginative, but also pretty predictable.  Since it isn't one full story, it is hard to compare it to other Grisham books.  However, unlike his others, this one did not keep you turning pages to find out what happens next.  The characters were colorful and well portrayed, but with the story and characters changing every thirty pages, it was hard to get to know the characters really well.      I suggest reading The Last Juror before this one.  All the stories are set in the county where this whole book took place and it helps you get an idea of the of the town and its people.     This would be a good book if you take long breaks between your readings, you can read one story then but it down for a week and not lose anything.
0756659841|5.0|I still haven't seen this book anywhere.  I am glad I pre-order this book from Amazon.
B000TKW3E2|5.0|I loved the movie... When I was watching it, I was captivated by the music... Nobody else than Thibaudet could be performing those MAGICAL SOUNDS!! The orchestra is perfect too!
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|As a teacher, I'm happy with this version of Henry VIII and his relationship to the Boleyn sisters, because I can show most of it to my classes. There are a few minor inaccuracies, but overall provides a good introduction to the subject, with great costumes and settings.
0756656230|5.0|This book set is great.  One book contains much history and background of the Lego company and products.  The other is all about the miniature figures.  Our kids and I spent hours of fun reading it.  The price in Amazon makes this book set a great buy.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Beautiful, pristine voice and a richness rarely found. She's a treasure and worth buying the CD.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|Loved this movie. I was expecting the worst but this terminator movie is runner up to the original only.
B002R68U7K|5.0|Britney Spears could be sometimes criticized, but in our modern times there is nobody who represents modern music better than she does. This is a must have POP compilation. Sound is incredible, editing is perfect, beautiful arrangements, and she knows how to give it all in every song.
0061438294|5.0|I went on and on about this book on Linkedin.  I'll keep it short.  The author spent 23 years as an FBI behavioral profiler.  Did I mention that the author was in the FBI for 23 years as a behavioral profiler?  He's very credible on the subject and relies too heavily on this persona.  Remember Jack Burns from Meet The Parents?  I'm guessing that Deniro's character was probably based on the author.    Now, the content.  Simply amazing.  I use it every day.  Once you learn it, you will probably find it hard to not use it.  It's as though someone added a whole new color to the visible spectrum.  Standing in line at Wal-Mart?  You'll notice things you've never ever noticed that are quite revealing about people.  Meet someone new and you'll see them differently from the start.  It's quite remarkable.    The pictures are a little corny.  But, the pictures do a good job of illustrating the subject matter.
B002WIDRM6|3.0|It's good.  I really like them.  But after loving every bit of their debut album, I just don't think it's quite up to par.   It's just \\"pretty good\\".  I'm still glad I bought it.  Maybe it'll grow on me a little more.
B002DYKP8S|5.0|I know and like this film very much, own it on DVD already but this BluRay did not play on our BluRay player.  That was a bummer, and we returned it.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|If you are a Whitney Houston fan, you will absolutely love this CD.  It is a collection of her best and most famous music.  Excellent buy and a great price.
B001684L0A|5.0|American history has never been so easy -- or so enjoyable.  We particularly appreciated the pop-up text boxes in the Blu-Ray version, which provided snippets of history that deepened our understanding of what we were watching.  Bravo, HBO!
B0026P3G12|2.0|I was disappointed with the selections of songs on this CD. It has some Christmas songs which would have been great on a Christmas Titled CD.
0670021652|5.0|Enjoyed the book. Well written. Didn't feel jumpy to me. Felt I was on a journey of discovery along with the author. Richly researched, information presented in a way to make you smile. Recommend reading!
B00275EGX8|2.0|Okay, I was suckered into buying the blu-ray of this film by all the hype I had heard. Nominations and more nominations...for 2+ hours of hand-held, formulaic, standard war movie, no better and probably no worse than the hundreds of war movies that have preceded it over the past near-century. What was all the fuss about? It is one of the first films to deal graphically with the ongoing Iraq war, and certainly it brings home the \\"war is hell\\" cencept that we've been seeing forever. After a nerve-wracking opening scene, and the introduction of the excellent Jeremy Renner as the bomb-crazed hotshot, the film begins to falter, and the dreary writing and predictable plot points stop the film dead in its tracks. The blu-ray itself is nothing special; the constant motion of the camera negates the potential sharpness of the photography. THE HURT LOCKER as Best Picture? AVATAR??? Let's hope for UP IN THE AIR; not the greatest film ever made but very entertaining, and moving at times too. I was neither entertained nor moved by HURT LOCKER.
0855329483|5.0|I have been doing silk ribbon embroidery off and on for years, but had gotten bored.  Saw this book and learned all sorts of new stuff.  Painting backgrounds was so simple.  And it has patterns to tailor to small projects or larger projects.  Great book - I would highly recommend it.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Saw 'UP' in the theater and it's a wonderful movie to add to my collection. Glad Amazon offered it a good price and as usual, happy with quick delivery : ). Thanks Amazon.
B00192O8TM|4.0|Another item where I didn't quite know what I was ordering.  I didn't know this was a young adult book but it turned out to be interesting though very simplistic in style.  For a YA book it caused a lot of thought and introspection into whether we are currently living in The Capitol.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was so pleased with this album that I had to buy more for other friends.  They in turn have been extremely pleased also.  Susan has a great voice, but her story is what makes it so lovable and I pray she does more albums.
B002VPDOFK|2.0|I like Alicia Keys but here's the fact: this cd + bonus dvd, tracks thing doesn't worth it. If you want to hear the songs only, then buy the cd, which is only half the price. I bought this one and i was dissapointed. There is nothing in the bonus dvd to be worth watching. the studio videos are lame, and there are only 2 music vedios which you can always find on youtube. do not buy it if u all you're excited about is the vedios, Do NOT.
0307454541|5.0|My book arrived in a timely manner.  It is in very good shape.  I will certaily purchase from this dealer again.
0596527055|5.0|The book certainly made me think.  There were a lot of simple thoughts laid out in a way different than most.  Definitely a good read
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I watched the show when it was on tv.I have watched all of the reruns. I wish the show could have stayed on even longer. Excellent value. But they are priceless to me.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is fun for hardcore gamers, but it's also a lot of fun for others because it's easy to learn. It promotes a lot of player interaction because of the card trading system. In fact trading cards ends up being the most fun part of this game.
1423107233|5.0|I have got interest in Walt Disney production collecting the Italian magazine Topolino (edited in Italy from 1949). For those who love animation and want to appreciate the work of many talented animators, this book is a real gift because it gives the possibility to see and touch (and sniff, for those who like books even for the smell) many of these otherwise unreachable drawings.  Thanks to Walt Disney Animation Studios for this book.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|This movie is a must own for all Blu Ray collectors.  Both the Video and Audio quality are among the best that I have seen.  Add in the fact that this is a fantastic movie that won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it should be clear why this movie deserves a spot on your shelf!
B000M5AJQI|4.0|this movie gives  you drama, suspense, horror and comedy all at the same time due to the amazing film director Martin Scorsese. great film
B001QERPDO|5.0|Irish band The Script delivers a very impressive debut album. Though they've been around for more than a decade, they were just recently signed (in 2007). Mostly love songs, the band of three Danny O'Donoghue, Mark Sheehan, and Glen Power provide a sound that can be both fast and rhythmic as in \\"Before the Worst\\" and slower and more powerful at times reminiscent of Sting the solo years, none more clearer than in \\"Talk You Down\\" and \\"Rusty Halo\\". \\"Breakeven\\" has gotten significant play time of late in the U.S. Don't miss the play on words nor the lyrics in the seemingly earnest song \\"If You See Kay\\". Lastly is the cautionary words of \\"Fall for Anything\\". The Script as a band seem to take the usual conventions and turn them on an axis just enough to make you listen to them anew. All in all, the self-titled debut album of The Script is very polished and surprisingly eclectic, and an instant classic for those that enjoy modern R&B.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Wintersong is my favorite holiday music cd. Sarah MacLachlan's  beautiful voice and her rendition of classic Christmas songs is unforgettable. I can listen to this over and over again and never get tired of it. I am so glad I purchased this CD.
0670021652|5.0|Oh wait, that made this review sound like marriage is a bad thing, like some sort of mental institution....Well, as Elizabeth Gilbert (author of Eat, Pray, Love) feels, it has all the charm and appeal to her of a strait jacket.  Oh sure, she loves Felipe (who you met in Eat, Pray, Love) but marriage?  Really?  That was the one truly monumental thing that they both agreed on....They would NEVER get married.....EVER.  Well, that is until Felipe is unable to get back across our border after having too many 90 day visas.      So, Elizabeth, being a writer and one who researches a lot, gives herself a mission....she will try to find out everything she can about marriage.  From tiny village elders half a world away, to her friends, family and throughout the history of marriage.    I wasn't sure if I would be interested in this book.  I've been happily married for 22 years, so for me, being skeptical about marriage is not something I'm dealing with.  I basically thought the book would be more about her, and after reading Eat, Pray, Love I wanted to know how things ended up and how she carried on after her soul searching after her bitter divorce.  Well, I loved this book.  I think it was a very satifying read.  I loved reading about her own life and struggles with Felipe and coming to grips on marriage and I loved all the research on marriages.  Who knew that arranged marriages actually have fewer failures?  Huh.....    Anyway, there are a lot of different insights-women who had careers in the 50's who gave them up to be wives and mothers, wives in the 70's during the feminism era and wives now, with and without children.  I thought this section was interesting on how women looked back on their decisions about being married, what their expectations were and whether or not they chose having children.      I enjoyed the book immensely and would recommend it to my friends, both those that are wives and those that aren't, as it is an interesting read.      Of course you also have the tied-up ending, where you find out if Elizabeth & Felipe actually do tie the knot, and that is just the icing on the cake (so to speak).
B000W7JWUA|5.0|If you like playing age of empires or civilization, you'll fall in love with this game. It's like those games only in real life. :)

It deals with the various aspects of our natural world:  Mountains, Oceans, Caves, Polar Regions, Forests, etc.    We would recomend it to anyone interested in knowing more about our world ... Earth!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|And boy did they pull it off!!! Star Trek 2009 is not a true reboot...without spoiling the film it is to hard to explain. I am not a big fan of the original series or the films. The Next Generation show was pretty good but wore on me quickly. Let's face it, Shatner is an over-actor. This movie scores high marks from story, to effects, to action and to casting. Pine (Kirk), Quinto (Spock) and Urban (McKoy) take the original characters to new heights. They keep the essence of them and expand like good actors should. In addition, the casting of Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike was outstanding. If you never liked Star Trek before, you will now! Some Trekkies are still probably crying. Excellent movie!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: I had the luxury of watching the DVD, watching the DVD on a Blu-Ray player and finally watching the Blu-Ray. It went from COOL, to NICE, to HOLY CRAP THAT LOOKS AWESOME! The picture is gorgeous, the audio is stunning and the extras immense. FINAL VERDICT: WARP SPEED TO BUY IT! A MUST OWN!

B0013ND36G|4.0|Well, let´s no talk about the movie, everybody has seen this movie so it has no point at all... it'll be helpful talk about the blu ray edition. The fact is this blu ray has just 3 languages (english, spanish and french), the good news are they are in 5.1, so sound is very good in all laguages availables. About video quality, if you are not a hi-def geek it will be fine, i mean, it is not \\"superb\\" just fine, there are still some dark scenes where you can see not so good quality.  About extras, well, i am not an extras-boy but for persons who does, it has enough extras to keep your mind busy for a while: Introduction by the governator itself, commentaries from director, hbo documentary, sgt candy scene (is a scene where is supposed they get the model for the terminator 800, thanks god they didn't put in the movie), bloopers (some are funny), gallery, dressing documentary, trailers, video game trailers, etc.  It will be a nice addition to your sci-fi action movies in blu ray, this was the reason i bought it.

B002T9H2LA|1.0|This movie illustrates that not only is Quentin Tarantino talented and imaginative but he is also perversely obsessed with the depiction of gruesome levels of violence.  Unfortunately, the gratuitous violence ends up spoiling what could be otherwise some brilliant scene making, and some memorable characters.  Christoph Waltz is absolutely brilliant and hypnotizing as a garrulous and smoothly sociopathic SS officer.  Brad Pitt plays a Tennessee rube turned Nazi Hunter.  There are memorable performances by other actors and actresses, but the level of graphic violence, much of which is unnecessary to the plot, suggests that Quentin Tarantino, for whatever undeniable talents he may have, is a disturbed man.  I probably should have been forewarned by some of his previous equally gruesome productions where violence takes center stage.  For people who don't want to watch people's brains being bashed in, or people being literally scalped in front of them, this is for sure a movie to avoid.  The director and producer needs lots of psychotherapy.

Amanda Seyfried is talented and charming as the young girl searching for her father. Her voice is amazing.

B003102JDM|5.0|[This is an attempt to interpret the complex narrative of the movie. Please read this *after* you've watched the movie - else skip to the last line :)]    Larry Gopnik is a professor of physics who teaches his students about 'Schrodinger's Cat' - the idea that the fate of an entity remains undefined right until the moment an agent acts and 'collapses the wave function,' so to speak. Gopnik believes that the story of the cat serves no purpose other than to illustrate a mathematical truth - and yet, strangely enough, Gopnik's human fate is no less uncertain and contingent than that of Schrodinger's hypothetical cat. For example, the very moment Gopnik \\"acts\\" to accept a bribe and pass his Korean student, his telephone rings, and he receives ominous news from his doctor. By this time, the strange causalities in the movie will have compelled us to ask if Gopnik's phone would have rung had he chosen differently. As Gopnik comes to realize, the \\"truth\\" of mathematics and numbers - be it in the form of Physics, the Mentaculus, or the Kabbalah - is beside the point. What is of essence is the human story.    To be sure, ASM is not an amoral thought experiment about actions determining outcomes. The movie takes a very specific moral position: \\"Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you.\\" If you willfully \\"act\\" in defiance of your fate, you will reap the consequences of your actions.     Gopnik is a man who almost never acts. As Michael Wood points out in his LRB review, Gopnik lives in a world where \\"agency always belongs to someone else.\\" Agency belongs to Sy, to the wife, to the son, and even to the Columbia Record club that makes you pay for taking no action at all. On the few occasions that Gopnik chooses to act, he meets with disaster. His refusal to accept his neighbor's encroachments into his property culminates in the bizarre death of a lawyer. His \\"road rage\\" - brought on by the sight of the Korean student - causes him to lose control of his vehicle and,via some twisted Schrodingerian logic, \\"cause\\" the death of Sy Ableman. Finally, Gopnik's refusal to accept the burden of his own legal expenses brings down a grave illness upon him. The moral of this tale seems to be: there is less suffering in passively accepting one's fate than in actively meddling with it - a credo of inaction, similar to the Christian doctrine of quietism and  the more ascetic interpretations of Karma.    And yet there is a delicious ambiguity concerning the theological foundation of this ethical vision. When Rabbi Marshak speaks to Danny, we wonder if we are hearing the settled wisdom of an ancient tradition, or the contemporary wisdom of a serious man who has just \\"received with simplicity\\" the truthless truth of The Airplane. Marshak's chamber, interestingly, looks more like the study of an amateur biologist, than that of a religious cleric.    ASM embodies the Judaic vision of tradition as a repository of stories. It has a \\"Russian Doll\\" structure - a story within a story, where the outer story echoes the inner one. What the dentist Sussman's story is to Gopnik, Gopnik's story is to us. Just like Gopnik, Sussman too is a \\"serious man\\" coping with a crisis that has turned his life upside down. Such stories - which constitute the tradition -  acquire significance through signs and tokens whose obscurity invites interpretation. The teeth in Sussman's story are referenced in Gopnik's story - we see a large model of teeth in Rabbi Marshak's chamber. And very mischievously, the background score chosen for the Sussman narrative is by Jimi Hendrix - a man famous for expressing himself with his teeth! \\"What does it mean?\\" Sussman asks the Rabbi, awaiting a revelation. The Rabbi is honest enough to admit his cluelessness - and so the mystery remains - only to be transmitted to Gopnik, and then to us - the last hearers of the story. Just like Gopnik, we too are addressees of the message that drove Sussman crazy. We too restlessly await an epiphany that will abolish the mystery.    At one level, this is a story about a father, a son, and the transmission of tradition. Note the parallel between Danny's Bar Mitzvah and Gopnik's tenure - the rites of passage father and son have to undergo. Our anxious wait ends with a \\"mazel tov\\" for both of them. The \\"rite of passage\\" theme is similarly evoked by the intense and purposeful neighbor who, determined to make a man out of his pre-adolescent son, inducts him into the violent sport of hunting.     The narrative has a beautiful circularity. When the story begins, the father is talking to his doctor and the son is in the classroom pondering a debt he owes. When it ends, the father is still talking to the doctor and the son is still in the classroom, except that now the clouds are gathering, and some great judgment is hand. The father makes his choice and condemns himself; the son dithers as the tornado approaches.    Thanks to Coen Brothers' attention to detail, one chances upon new significances in every subsequent viewing. The Rabbi Nachtner sequence stands on its own as a stunning reminder of the Coen Brothers' mastery of their medium. The actors deliver stellar performances - Stuhlbarg creates magic with his face and his voice. The crouched, defensive man who negotiates with the Columbia Record club could not be more different from the tenured professor who is about to change Clive's grade. And as we have come to expect from the Coen brothers, characters tend to have comical tics. There's Gopnik's wife's rapid blinking when she is agitated; Sy's tendency to say \\"most important\\" in his mellifluous voice; and of course, the kid in the bus who has just discovered the joy of expletives.    To call this movie a masterpiece would be to state the obvious. This is the Coen brothers' subtlest and most cerebral work yet. It is a serious work of art.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|Avantasia's 'The Scarecrow' is an excellent, excellent CD.    Starting off hard with the first track Twisted Mind, a solid Heavy Metal track, it then takes an abrupt turn to the epic with its titular track, The Scarecrow, which is a 10 minute long song featuring the golden voiced Jorn Land and a decided Symphonic metal bent.     From there, it switches tact again, going to the pure Power Metal of Shelter From The Rain, then relaxes a bit with Carry Me Over.      The Scarecrow is a CD that shows off Avantasia's range in music - From Soft Rock to Symphonic Metal, Avantasia can pull it all off, and well.    Heavily recommended for anyone who likes metal.

However one-quarter of the way through to the end she is too much into her innerself, her left brain hemisphere relating to her right brain hemisphere.  I don't think a stroke victim reading this cares what the ying and yang think and inneract, I believe they just want to know how to cope and get better. I rate the book just o.k.  What I got out of it was that even though it took about seven years, she fully recovered.

B002TZS5GU|4.0|I picked this up on a whim. It seemed right up my alley, but I was surprised that I had never heard of it before, especially since it stars the new Captain James Tiberius Kirk. My expectations were very low. Seemed like it was going to be a cheap little independent film with no substance. But I was wrong: it's a cheap little independent film that's actually pretty smart.<br /><br />The premise is a tad cliche. It takes places after a devastating and extremely-contagious virus has decimated the planet. We never get an explanation for the outbreak or how our main characters have survived up until now--true to post-apocalyptic form. I would agree that sometimes it's a pain when a filmmaker tries to explain everything when the audience can usually fill in the blanks themselves, but still, we're getting to the point were it's expected.<br /><br />The story itself follows four young adults: two brothers and their respective girlfriends. They're on their way to a beach that the brothers used to frequent in their younger days, and doing their best to scavenge for food and gas enroute. Semi-weak premise, semi-weak story, and semi-weak characters. Luckily, the writing and directing are good enough to see this movie through all 85 minutes of its running time.<br /><br />For the most part, it's all about the little encounters along the way to this beach of theirs. The people that they meet and the situations that they get themselves into during their most desperate times play out very well. It starts out kind of slow, but it finds its feet fast enough. These encounters are very tense and well shot. And they very expertly provide us post-apocalypse aficionados with what we always look for in a movie like this: Situations that force us as viewers to question how we would handle such a thing. Would we really resort to such strict utilitarianism, or would we do \\"the right thing?\\" They're interesting to think about, to me, at least.<br /><br />So, for a rental, I certainly think I got my money's worth. The ending was rushed and ill-conceived, which was extremely unfortunate, since it deterred me from thinking of purchasing it. This is a shame, since halfway through, it was almost looking like America's answer to 28 DAYS LATER. Better characterization, a better ending, and a longer running time would have made this a winner. The directors are definitely talented, and I hope they consider making a sequel of some kind.<br /><br />Maybe four stars is a little high, but this movie was great for what it was. It was short, had some great moments, and it's one of the better movies in the genre to have been released lately. It's definitely worth the rent, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.was rushed and ill-conceived, which was extremely unfortunate, since it deterred me from thinking of purchasing it.

B000XCZGV8|5.0|I really don't know where to begin with David Fincher's ZODIAC. It is, without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time. Not sure how this came to be or what it says about my character. I remember not even really caring so much about it the first time I saw it. I mean, it's a story about an unsolved murder: one that has been cold for over three decades. Not only that, but it's not even a \\"slasher film\\" if you get right down to it. More like a three hour true-crime film. And you (perhaps) never see the real killer's face in the film once, depending on how you view it.<br /><br />Then why did this movie come to scare me so much? How did it succeed in frightening me more so than any other slasher/killer flick that I've ever seen? It's because, when you come to realize the circumstances surrounding the Zodiac murders, you'll find that this movie is more-or-less dead accurate to the smallest detail. (Me living very close to where these murders took place probably didn't help matters either!)<br /><br />To summarize the plot, ZODIAC mostly centers around a San Francisco Chronicle political cartoonist, named Robert Graysmith. He comes to work as he usually does to discover that a killer has sent the Chronicle a written confession to a series of murders. In addition, this Zodiac goes out of his way to taunt the publication by stating that if a cipher he has included with the letter isn't printed in the newspaper, he will kill again. But this story is not strictly about the murderer's acts, but more about the surrounding investigation, and how it goes from bad to worse.<br /><br />This movie is frightening when you discover the level of detail that has been painstakingly weaved into this movie (I've come to expect this with every David Fincher film I watch). Most of the murder scenes were filmed where the actual killings took place. And since there had been survivors, you get an accurate account of how these fatal encounters actually went down. Every behavioral tick that the Zodiac actually exhibited during the murders are reconstructed to the smallest detail. From what he said to how he acted to how he seemed almost like he was cheesing it up at times. This is one of the only movies I've seen where I felt like I was getting inside the mind of this killer.<br /><br />There is a lot of drama here, and excellent performers by all of the actors. Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr. expertly pull off their roles as men who become caught in a downward spiral into paranoia and near-insanity with every passing day that the Zodiac is never caught. Mark Ruffalo does an excellent job channeling Detective Dave Toschi, the real life SF homicide detective who became the inspiration for both DIRTY HARRY and BULLITT (a fact brought up in the film). Finally, John Carroll Lynch pulls off a very haunting, but very brief, performance as the man who would become the prime suspect in the case. At first, one might think that he's laying it on kind of weak, until you realize that this is actually how A.L.N. behaved during the interview. You see every flinch, every hint of nervousness, and every hesitation. That is brilliant acting, I must say.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is still a movie about a case that was never solved, but it came very close. The filmmakers never specifically say that THIS HERE was the man who should be blamed for these murders, but it lays out all the evidence for the viewer and asks US to make the decision for ourselves. In that sense, we become the detectives in this case.<br /><br />I would encourage anyone with a passing interest in the investigation to watch the documentary included with this Director's Cut. You will see for yourself just how close this movie came to translating the real events, and you just might find yourself trying to piece together the puzzle with the main characters. This is a powerful and tragically underrated film (and probably David Fincher's best work to date) and carries with it a mass of questionmarks that might never be answered. But ZODIAC challenges us to try.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pick up this Director's Cut of ZODIAC. I couldn't have imagined how an already extraordinary film could get even better, but this cut of the movie shows that miracles are possible.<br /><br />I am not Avery.hallenges us to try.    Do yourself a favor and pick up this Director's Cut of ZODIAC.

B00364K6YW|5.0|Of all the Jane Austen movies, the 1996 miniseries \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is arguably the best and most detailed. While remaining faithful to the original comedy of manners, the story remains steadily-paced and exceptionally acted. It's sort of a thinking-girl's romance movie.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley (Crispin Bonham-Carter) moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to eldest Jane (Susannah Harker). But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie (Jennifer Ehle) immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), who scorns the rural village.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships arrive, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham (Adrian Lukis), who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia (Julia Sawalha) elopes with Wickham! The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie.<br /><br />It's obvious from the very first scenes -- when Lizzie jokingly comments that \\"a man of good fortune MUST be in want of a wife\\" -- that this is an adaptation that was done with love. The subplots, characters and atmosphere of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" are all here.<br /><br />The plot unfolds slowly, one piece at a time, but with several subplots that tie together as the story progresses. For a miniseries, it's actually rather spare and lacking in filler. And the dialogue -- based on Austen's -- is wonderfully well-written (\\"Beauty is not the only virtue. She has just inherited a fortune of ten thousand pounds, I understand.\\" \\"Now THAT is a definite virtue!\\")<br /><br />The time period is recreated with loving detail, from the muddy roads to the sweeping mansions with elaborate grounds. Even the hairstyles are recreated. And the entire plot is steeped in the mores of 19th-century England, with the attitudes toward marriage, love, and propriety that bound everyone (especially women).<br /><br />The casting of the leads is absolutely perfect for this movie: Ehle and Firth are nothing short of amazing. Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways. Firth's Darcy is a selfish man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Ehle's Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />They're also backed by an excellent supporting cast, with slimy clergy, screeching moms, sly seducers, sardonic fathers, innocent sisters and aristocratic old harpies adding colour to it all. Sawalha is especially good as the 19th-century Valley Girl, and Alison Steadman gives a grating but suitable performance as the whiny, marriage-obsessed Mrs. Bennett.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the cream of the Austen crop, and an understatedly romantic movie as well.

B00005JMJG|4.0|Although deliberately disorienting, this psychological drama with some science fiction elements seems to wrap up rather well, but it's an emotional rollercoaster ride for the viewer!<br /><br />But to connect the dots of this love story takes a lot of work for the audience/viewer to sort out.  Reminds me strongly of elements from Chris Nolan's Memento in form and substance to a large degree.  Joel Barrish is played by Jim Carrey in a dramatic, intensely emotional role and Kate Winslett plays Clementine, a wilful, brutally honest woman with an impulsive mind of her own.<br /><br />The story actually has a backdrop regarding a company called Lacuna, which specializes in wiping memories of those we've missed and rather than deal with the pain, we would rather forget about it.  Unfortunately trying to forget instead of deal with it is not so easy.<br /><br />Thus the good doctor that runs Lacuna runs a very brisk business.  People want to forget Fido or forget their dead husbands and wives, their broken hearts.  The doc and his employees are a pretty irresponsible, unethical bunch.<br /><br />The doctor himself uses the memory erasing techniques to wipe out his receptionist's affair with him.  Damn!  And Patrick, another assistant, uses Joel's memories to pick up on the girl Joel is erasing.  Stealing the files, Patrick's plan seems to work out OK for some time.  This part of the story was never resolved for me, since Patrick never was caught or punished for this clear doctor patient violation.<br /><br />Trying not to get too \\"into\\" the subplots, Joel overall seemed a good guy in this film but a bit addled and frightened by the memory erasure procedure, especially after he found out that his girl did the same thing.<br /><br />The special effects were well done and subdued -- memories erase, and Clementine and Joel hide in memories to prevent the erasing.<br /><br />The overall film, though very original and at times endearing and charming, did not hold my interest to a great degree.  Even so, Kate Winslett got an Academy Award nomination for best actress in 2004 for this film.<br /><br />Jim Carrey in a dramatic role never appealed to me, so I must protest the casting.<br /><br />What if you could erase memories of those you've loved and lost?

B00004ZBVG|5.0|I love to order previously viewed DVDs!! My husband keeps an ongoing wish list of DVDs...he likes to collect movies. This one was shipped quickly and was in great condition.
0500512159|5.0|My boyfriend is a breakdancer and owns about 150 pairs of sneakers.  I got this book as a Christmas gift for him and he just absolutely loved it. Great illustrations and images.  The book is well put together and pretty detailed.  However one thing that they didn't really mention was that the cover is a slightly padded material.  Just makes the book a more interesting item.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|The singing in the movie is absolutely incredible!  The acting is supreme, and it took me back to the time when I saw it on Broadway.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves musicals!
B001UV4XUQ|4.0|I never watched \\"3rd Rock from the Sun\\" when it was an active series. However, I continue to find that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is quite a gifted actor having delivered solid performances in several indie movies including Araki's \\"Mysterious Skin\\", \\"The Lookout\\" and \\"Brick\\". This summer his bid to get closer to a major breakthrough in feature films, he delivers a wonderful performance in the poetic gem that is \\"500 Days of Summer\\".<br /><br />Mr. Gordon-Levitt often approaches his roles with a wink and a nod demonstrating that he truly loves his craft. He is joined by a great supporting cast including the equally charming Zooey Duchanel. In a refreshing take on young love, the script has some fun like when he and Zooey finally consummate their budding relationship.<br /><br />He is a very empathetic actor and one almost bristles at how casual Zooey's character is towards the entire budding, office romance. The movie perfectly captures so much of what is memorable about falling in love and what is as stifling as the lost of that love. Told from a male point of view, Zooey's character takes on the more traditional masculine characteristics like acting non-commital even after lines have been crossed into deeper parts of a relationship.<br /><br />Mr. Gordon-Levitt also possesses a more than adequate singing voice that indicates yet another aspect of his talent. When he belts out at a office karaoke party, you are more than entertained. He is clearly set up for a big breakthrough in movies. It is a joy to embrace him as his burgeoning talent builds and will eventually make him a major  actor in starring roles in larger films.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I very rarely buy any CD's, but Susan Boyle I had to have.  I enjoy her tracks, especially in the morning driving to work or after a difficult day.  She lifts me up and I love her voice and expressivness.[[ASIN:B0026P3G12 I Dreamed A Dream]]
B00139W3NE|4.0|Having read all 3 of the books in this series, I was excited to see a film version. I did enjoy it very much, so much that I bought my own DVD and have re-watched it at least 10 times.  BUT, if a person sits down to watch the movie and is not familiar with what all the controversy is about \\"dust\\", then it's a very lightweight fantasy film that just has good special effects.  I would love to see the other 2 books made into movies also, but I hear this one did not do well enough to make that happen.  As for all the \\"church\\" controversy, hogwash. A truly religious person is not going to be swayed by the innuendos in this tale, and non-religious people will just have those snide comments go right over their heads.  Impact to the church? NIL.  As for impressionable children, heck how often do kids pay attention to dialogue in a film? They watch for the action. And the special effects. If you are looking for a good fantasy film with some great acting, this is a fun time.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This film is an amazing look into the REAL Michael Jackson, showing the pure, sincere, musical genius at his heartfelt best. I can't tell you how many friends of mine have had their minds changed and negative opinions changed from seeing the real MJ and not following the media, tabloids, etc, over the past years that pushed MJ away from the USA. This incredible human being was a great gift to the world and I am so thankful we have this film showing him in his true light. I more than highly recommend it, and every single fan and pseudo-fan of The King of Pop should absolutely have this in their movie library.<br /><br />RIP MJ. We love you!
B000BP5V0S|5.0|The Vienna New Years Concert directed by Marris Jannsons in 2006 is one of the most ebtertaining music videos. No matter what music turns you on, these songs and this superb orchestra will keep you listening and viewing. The extra of Austria toured with the accompanying Mozart melodies, is worth the price of the DVD alone. How great.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Alright, \\"greatest movie of all time\\", let's see what you've got.    Anyone who sets out to review \\"Citizen Kane\\" with the goal of determining, on first viewing, whether it is the greatest film ever made is setting themselves up for disappointment.  It's a burden of expectations that is best set aside, insomuch as that is possible.  Reviewing \\"Kane\\" today poses a lot of challenges; its main plot point has been thoroughly spoiled, its technical innovations are standard by now, and it has been the subject of numerous parodies (the first I can remember seeing being an episode of \\"Tiny Toon Adventures\\" in the early 1990s).    We open with the famous dying word of one Charles Foster Kane, media tycoon turned disappointed recluse in his vast Florida mansion.  Kane, played as an adult by Orson Welles (actor/writer/producer/director; I'm assuming he just didn't have time to edit and score it), is plucked from his poor upbringing to a life of great wealth, and enters into the newspaper business.  On his death, a reporter out to uncover the meaning of `Rosebud' interviews various people from his past:  his second ex-wife Susan (Dorothy Comingore), his longtime #2, Bernstein (Everett Sloane), and his sometimes best friend Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten).  None has any idea what `Rosebud' means, but they talk a lot about their experiences with Kane.    \\"Citizen Kane\\" is similar to the works of Theodore Dreiser, depicting the damage to the soul caused by the pursuit of money above all else.  Kane's whole life and all his relationships, public and private, are defined by trying to get people to love him, despite struggling to love anyone himself.  Kane is well-played by Welles, and supported by a group of great actors, notably \\"The Third Man\\"'s Joseph Cotten.  The age makeup used to allow the same actors to play characters over a 50-year span is surprisingly good for the period (the black-and-white probably helps with that).  Many of \\"Kane\\"'s technical innovations have been standardized in subsequent decades, but, having seen several other film styles from this era, one can still appreciate how this film looks.  I did find a few of the scene transitions and music a bit jarring.    Recommended (really, everyone should see this film just to get a sense of it).
0920668364|5.0|I wanted this book for my daughter to give to her son.  It arrived in perfect condition, and I can't wait to give it to her.
B00000IMTE|5.0|BUY THIS! EVERY SINGLE SONG IS ROCKIN, FULL OF ENERGY< GOOD OLE DAYS OF ROCK N ROLL!!!!
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Bought the Dvd used for an extremely low price quite soon after it was released. Prompt delivery, great quality, no scratches. Loved it!
1564029654|5.0|My son likes owls so I bought this book and \\"Ollie\\" the Owl for him for Christmas.  He is two and seems really interested in the pictures and story.  The story is three owls wake up and their mommy is not there, it's dark and they're scared.  It's good on many levels - mommy comes back, there was no reason for all the fuss, no need to be afraid of the dark, etc.  So, if you're having nighttime or separation anxiety problems, it's a good story to help reinforce that it's ok.  You'd probably have to \\"link\\" the story to the issue for your child by talking to them but I think it could be a good tool.    The story is sweet as just a story too.  The pictures are nicely done.  I guess I too have a soft spot in my heart for owls...
B002E9LP36|5.0|Great story embedded in a very interesting time and geographical setting. The audio is fantastic. The readers bring incredible life to the characters. We listened to this every night on our two week sailing cruise - wonderful entertainment!
1423119509|5.0|I picked up this series on a recommendation from a friend and I have to say I was not disappointed in the least!!!!  I would highly recomment this series to any fan of fantasy writing.  And as a father of two young girls I would have no problem with them reading the stories as well!  The box set comes in the \\"fun\\" treasure chest box with a hidden compartment where a small surprise awaits you.  If your looking to purchase these books in hardcover this is the perfect set!!!!!!
B001CJJWUW|4.0|Fabulous blu-ray video, great music. But does Meat Loaf REALLY need to have this disgusting wad of chewing gum is his mouth as he sings? You'd think at least they'd edit out the closeups. And he doesn't have the voice he used to. Having said that, though, the band and his backup singers are great and make this definitely worth getting if you're a fan
B001FBSMW6|2.0|I am ok with bands exploring new ground with new albums, if the result is good. I think the first two albums from Keane are simply brilliant but this third release they drift into territory that they just don't have that same knack for. The album isn't horrible, but by comparison it really falls short. I will be anxiously awaiting their fourth album and this will get little to know play time from me.
B001CZVVXW|5.0|This is a great video and audio treat. While Anna Caterina Antonacci doesn't have quite the voice of Leontyne Price (arguably the best vocal Carmen of all time), she certainly looks and acts the part superbly. The rest of the company is excellent as well. A wonderful production.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Ordered the CD as a gift for my daughter.  It arrived very soon after ordering and my daughter loves it.  Very satisfied with the service.
B000G759LW|5.0|I bought this CD off of Amazon when it 1st came out (yes, a while ago) but some how managed to lose it when I moved (or maybe the ex stole it) anyways, I am going to order another copy because I miss it!  It's a rare occasion when I do actually like every song on an album especially a two disc CD but this one I love.  Who would have thought looking back to the \\"Genie in a bottle\\" days of the poppy turn on the radio & all you heard was Christina singing that horrible song & \\"Come on Over\\" that she would turn out to be such a terrific artist?  Hey if you liked her back then sorry but I didn't.  Some of the more upbeat songs I love on this CD are: Makes me wanna pray, Ain't no other man, & Still dirty.  The three most heart filled & kind of sad are: Oh Mother, Hurt, & The right man.  Bottom line even if you were never a Christina Aguilera fan before well, this album is a lot different than her other stuff.  It combines pop, jazz, & dance together for a 5 star album!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I had purchased the first season of The Big Bang Theory for my husband last year.  We liked being able to see episodes we might have missed and to re-watch ones we loved.  Now we have the second season and love it, as ell.  Have loaned it to family members an have hooked them on the show, too.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|This movie is more of a drama than a comedy. If you get this movie expecting it to be like Superbad or American Pie, you might be disappointed. However, it is one of the best coming of age movies I have ever seen, and I own over 2000 movies on DVD. The story is compelling and the acting elicits emotion from the viewer. You empathize with the characters and their lives. Everything about this movie seems so real, as if you know these people and in the end, you care about them.
B00110K62U|5.0|Although the image is not pure HD, it is widescreen and the sound is amazing.  The performers are incredible, and I had chills during the whole show.  Highly recommended.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Never got to see the HBO mini series while on the air. This was a great price and was shipped very quickly.
B000002MUW|5.0|Bedtime Stories is one of madonna's best albums considering there is only one odd track (I'd Rather B Ur Lover) which sounds dated and more like a demo. A remix and a better beat with samples could have saved this song from filler heaven.  Having recently listened to the whole cd track by track, I like every song. Luv Tried 2 Welcome Me and Sanctuary are less known songs which I used to avoid but they r actually cool tracks with a chill trip hop vibe that puts u in a trance. Some of my fave Madonna songs r included like \\"Inside of Me\\" and \\"Secret\\".  I also like the song Bedtime Story, Madonna's Bjork experience.  Human Nature has the classic line \\"I'm not ur beotch don't blame ur S@#$ on me\\".  I'm sure evry1 can relate 2 that and it comes in handy if some1 is disrespecting u.....Thanks Madonna!
B001AVCFK6|4.0|Got the movie on bluray and enjoyed it very much. Surprisingly, my wife enjoyed it as well and she don't even get down with science fiction. A must buy for all.
B000N6TYLW|1.0|Having missed the entire Gilmore Girls series after one or two of the first season's broadcasts (hey, I was busy--I didn't watch any TV to speak of following 9/11 either), I am now starting to watch the entire series from the beginning.    I haven't seen the later episodes at all yet, but from people's reviews, it sounds like the show's creators took the cheap, low road when they decided to make Rory turn into an uncharacteristic floozey.  I think this was a bad choice, both artistically and in terms of fidelity to reality.  Real people's bedrock characters, (as we see in shows like 7-up, 14-up, etc.) don't change that much, and so a real-life character like the Rory Gilmore of the first season would be unlikely to lie, cheat, or drop out of school, as they have the puppet Rory do in this series.  Maybe the writers thought that this would be more believable to a general audience, but I think it was cowardly and chinzy on the part of the writers to deviate from the more difficult, but more realistic challenge of what author Garrison Keillor calls, \\"Making Goodness Interesting\\".  In fact, as Keillor pointed out once in an unrelated Writer's Almanac segment, it can be done.     A more difficult, less palatable, but more realistic story might have shown a fading, middle-aged Lorelei consumed with aging jealousy over Rory's growing self confidence and charisma, and vow to destroy her daughter Rory, who then would have to contend with slander and sabotage of various kinds without, in her innocence, loyalty, and fundamental naievity, realizing its source... That would have been a more dramatic, far darker, but inherently more realistic and complex story line that would have realistically preserved the integrity of Rory's character (and been quite consistent with Lorelai's character in her need for attention and uncontested \\"Queen Bee\\" status) while providing more-than-adequate sources of conflict for \\"dramatic interest\\".      But then, we know from shows like \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" that the cheapest, tawdriest, and most unrealistic story lines prevail over far more realistic, subtler (not to mention \\"cleaner\\") plotlines that a more imaginitive and courageous writer might create.  The viewer ends up watching a show which, while certainly tittilating, turns out to be on the level of emotional truthfulness, realism, and consistency, nothing but \\"absolute bosh from beginning to end\\" (as the fictional but internally more consistant character Polly from The Magician's Nephew might have remarked).
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Watched the whole season and loved it. These bikers are so bad ass that even a person such as myself(brotha from the streets) can get down with it. Just waiting on season 2 now!
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I have been hooked on Lost, since it came out. Looking forward the number 6, the final season.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|What \\"Rosencrantz and Gildenstern Are Dead\\" was to \\"Hamlet,\\" \\"Rome\\" is to \\"Julius Caesar.\\"  This series is an imaginative retelling of the rise of Julius Caesar and his successor, Octavian.  Arguably, this novelization of the period stretches the truth a bit, but the depiction of the overall atmosphere of the age and the life of the 'average' Roman, make this an immensely entertaining piece.  The series weaves the stories of the Ruling Class and \\"Joe-6-chalice\\" from the end of the Gaelic Wars until the defeat of Marc Anthony at the hands of Octavian in a breathlessly new and earthy series of adventures that is far from the usual Hollywood Blood and Sands, and avoids the usual Romans are really upper class British Empire stereotypes.  The cast is unusually exceptional and the tale is very well told.  At the end, you will bemoan the brevity of only 24 episodes.    A word about this particular release.  I had the good fortune to see the original broadcasts and the first DVD release.  Seeing it in high definition blue ray is stunning.  One can clearly see the richness and careful composition of the cinematographer.  It is a vastly improved experience!  I enjoyed the special documentation and especially valued the \\"All Roads Lead to Rome\\" feature, which would periodically during the viewing add in some interesting historical reference.  Its only drawback was its infrequency, and like me, you will wish for more.
0439023491|5.0|This series of books are fantastic.  Could not put them down once started,  Cannot wait for #3 in August 2010.
0451209338|5.0|The first in the series of super spy Gabriel Allon.  I was hooked when I read 'The Confessor' first and then found out this was only one in a whole series of Gabriel Allon books.  I knew then I had to read them all.  I didn't know about Daniel Silva until Amazon recommended some books based on my past orders.   Thanks Amazon for getting me hooked on this great writer who places me on a roller coaster with every page.  And thanks to all who complete reviews on products purchased,  it does help in making a decision.
0385532458|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Though this is a departure from Grisham's usual books, it's excellent.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This is an all-in-one collection of one of the best \\"dark\\" television series.  I was more than pleased with this item.  I had seen either season one or season two but I didn't want to buy them seperately.  This is the one set to buy.  David Lynch fans will love it.  I am a very satisfied customer.  This is an excellent series for a \\"marathon\\".
