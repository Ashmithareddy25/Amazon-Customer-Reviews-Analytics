0143038095|3.0|Generally, I am drawn to stories that expose me to cultures unlike my own.  From that perspective alone, I found Tan's novel to be intriguing and genuine; the individual stories are rich in culture and language.  I believe I would have enjoyed it more had the book been presented as a collection of short stories instead.  The lack of continuity from chapter to chapter is what kept me from really connecting with this book.    I spent much of my reading time flipping back to earlier chapters to remind myself which daughter was born of which mother so that I could see how the mother's experiences and upbringing had an effect on her daughter's life.  There were also a few mother/daughter story lines that I felt could have been explored more in depth and that's why I think presenting them as short stories would have been more effective.    This is the first of Tan's books that I have read, but I do intend to try another one!

Muerte like some Mike Giant books has images on one side of the page and the title on the other the images are the size of the whole page. No text just art. Like the Product states it has 96 pages and the dimensions are 9.3in. X 6.6 in. Soft Cover.
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|I like the character, I like the plot, but You WILL get nauseous trying to watch this movie! The videotography is terrible. The camera shakes all over the place. What is with some directors. I can hold my Sony camcorder a lot more steady. Ug! is the next sequeal as poorly filmed? I am hesitant to try it.
1400032717|3.0|OK. So I can certainly recognize that the author came up with a somewhat original idea. Granted, RAINMAN, was the first type of media to make special needs children/people shine more brightly within the mainstream consciousness.   When I finished reading this novel, I felt somewhat left out in the cold waiting for something else to happen. I am not sure why, I just did. But, I will say this author did a good job of telling the story through an autistic boy's viewpoint.  I would recommend this book for teenagers, more sophisticated level readers - like AP students but not for anyone who wants to get more out of a book then just a story albeit from a unique point of view. The writing style I guess is what has left me somewhat ambivalent because the originality balances the language simplicity out.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is a crime drama with a twist.  Very different from all of the other programs on tv.
014240165X|5.0|I checked this out for my 4th grade daughter because it was on her schools AR list and worth 10 pts. It took her about 3 weeks to read it, but she LOVED it! She is getting ready to start the second book. She loved all the spy gadgets and the brave Alex character!
0553582445|5.0|Robin Hobb is an amazing writer and this book showcases that talent.  The characters are rich and deep.  Wonderfully human and complicated.  Twists and turns fill the plot,drawing the reader ever further into a detailed  world.  Normally books of this size drag in sections, however, Hobb  manages to fill the narration with believable emotion, making it a surprisingly quick and enjoyable read.  The book was a great read and I cannot wait to read the others.

B0000AUHOH|3.0|As Captain Admirel James Kirk (William Shatner) with Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and the rest of the crew (DeForrest Kelly, George Takai, James Doohan, Walter Koenig and Nichelle Nichols) are having a nice pleasant camping trip since their newly christened U.S.S. Enterprise are having it at spacedock for repairs. They get called on a urgent mission to head to planet Nimbus III where a renegade Vulcan named Sybok (Laurence Luckinbill) has taken some people there hostage as he wants the Enterprise to find the universe's most supreme being.<br /><br />Considered by fans and critics alike as the worst movie in the franchise!  William Shatner who directed and wrote the story for this movie. One of the biggest problems in this movie is too much lighthearted humor unlike \\"Star Trek 4\\" which worked like a charm but this movie overdoses on it too much especially on Scotty and Uhra who feel romantically involved and of course the infamous teaching Spock how to sing campfire songs. The special effects themselves are quite bad without the help of Industrial Light and Magic as they come off as laughable and the characterization is thin as a pencil but at least Shatner got to give this movie a try at directing and co-storying the film but he failed at that.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD contains good picture and sound with great extras such audio commentary from William Shatner with Liz Shatner and Text commentary by Michael Okuda co-author of the Star Trek Encyclopedia. Featurettes, deleted scenes, production gallery, trailers and TV Spots.
B0011HOEY4|1.0|I want to share with you a few of the tentative conclusions I've reached regarding Ridley Scott's diatribes. And I stress the word \\"tentative,\\" because the subject of what motivates Ridley is tricky and complex. Before I say anything else, let me remind Ridley that I must ask that his proxies avoid the extremes of a pessimistic naturalism and an optimistic humanism by combining the truths of both. I know they'll never do that so here's an alternate proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit trying to shatter and ultimately destroy our most precious possessions. If we are powerless to create greater public understanding of the damage caused by his hatchet jobs, it is because we have allowed Ridley to spawn delusions of recidivism's resplendence. To state it in stark and simple terms, some lubricious, foul-mouthed lousy-types actually insist that no one is smart enough to see through his transparent lies. This is the kind of muddled thinking that he is encouraging with his beliefs. Even worse, all those who raise their voice against this brainwashing campaign are denounced as meddlesome nymphomaniacs.<br /><br />Let me move now from the abstract to the concrete. That is, let me give you a (mercifully) few examples of Ridley's outrageous ineptitude. For starters, his \\"I'm right and you're wrong\\" attitude is backwards because it leaves no room for compromise. That's our situation today, in very rough outline. Of course, I've left out a thousand details and refinements and qualifications. I've not mentioned that by excluding any possibility of comparison, Ridley Scott can easily pass off his own \\"compromises\\" as works of genius. And I've ignored neopaganism altogether. I've simply pointed out one key fact: Most pundits are uncertain about the magnitude of the threat posed by Ridley's viewpoints.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Joss Whedon's masterpiece television series, Firefly, came to the big screen in 2005 with Serenity. This movie really does live up to the series. It is of course different in that the sort of things you can do in a movie are different from the sort of things that you can do in a series, however Joss Whedon was allowed to make the movie he wanted to make, and the result is stunning. I have seen \\"Serenity\\" roughly 20 times, and, to quote from a line from one of the characters, \\"that's never getting old.\\"
0812550706|4.0|I always wanted to read this book, but never got around to it until it was assigned to me by my young adult literature professor.  I enjoyed this book very much and finished it in about a week.  I will do my review in the following format: the good, the bad, and the ugly.    The Good:    The story itself is enthralling.  It is the story of a child prodigy who is hand picked by none other than the leader of earth's most powerful army.  He is trained to become the new supreme commander in a brutal and cold manner, this is the strength of this book.  Are the generals justified in their cruel treatment of Ender?  You have to read the book to decide.  Another aspect of the story that I found interesting was Ender's fascination with the enemy.  He was the only one that seemed to want to know more about the \\"buggers\\" and their cause.  I also loved the strategy involved in the battle room games.  Ender's dream simulation program also progressed the story and character in an entirely innovative way. Genius!    The Bad:    Ender himself is an intriguing but unsympathetic character for much of the book.  Although he is inherently good-natured, he was too distant for me to embrace as a likeable hero.  He rarely makes a human connection with those around him and learns to see people only as resources for his cause.  There were only two things that I didn't enjoy about this book and this was one of them.    The Ugly:    The other thing I didn't like about the book was the crude language and violence.  I do understand that these are children, but seeing as how they are all very gifted I expected more of the characters to speak with a little more nobility and respect.  The violence left me feeling dull and hollow.    In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this book despite my complaints.  If you enjoy science fiction, fantasy, or even Harry Potter, I am sure you will LOVE this one.  This book also contains the most powerful and shocking ending I have ever read.  I am extremely excited about the film adaptation that should be released soon.  In short: reading this exciting book will give you a greater appreciation of the movie!

1400063515|5.0|I have to admit a large bias.<br /><br />I really like Nassim Taleb.  I definitely don't agree with everything he says, but I understand why he is trumpeting his views.  Perhaps it is because I trade the markets too.<br /><br />I have been trading through the same time period as Nassim.  We trade with similar utility functions, in that we primarily profit from outliers.  It is a terribly difficult way to profit, but the benefit is you understand the true nature of the human race the way it truly is, a jungle.<br /><br />We need to make sure we are not the prey.<br /><br />When he writes, he is often irritating.  It is a device to make people think.  Thinking is hard, and he knows that.  But crucial.<br /><br />Does he agree with many of the standards of measure that dictate \\"business as usual\\" in today's commerce?  No, very few.  Because he believes, and proves, that the normal limits that business and typical education instill on the rest of society are limits that you likely can't afford.<br /><br />For example:<br />A belief that might only be incorrect just once in your lifetime better not be one that can cripple you financially when you are 68 and can't recover.  Or even a whole generation at the same time.<br /><br />Thanks to Nassim Taleb's Black Swan, there is clear indication and warning that the world's foundations of thought, money and finance are not built on reality, but a form of \\"reality\\" that benefits a narrow slice of recipients.<br /><br />He does believe in 2 plus 2 equalling 4.  But, he gives clear evidence that there is too much reliance on \\"what everyone takes for granted\\" structures which can evaporate overnight when it doesn't work for the \\"powers that be\\".<br /><br />Far from being a conspiracy promoter, Black Swan exposes the culprit that makes one feel overwhelmed or victimised by unexpected events to be OUR unwillingness to accept the fact that life isn't a risk-free gesture and YOU have the responsibility to think for yourself.  Or risk potentially dire consequences.<br /><br />Joel Rensink<br />Archimedes Investments
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is truly groundbreaking not because of effects (though it's awfully shiny too!) but because of the magnificent storytelling and the amazingly well developed characters... and all this in only 14 episodes. Joss Whedon is a genius of storytelling, and this is his masterpiece.
0440238609|5.0|Despite what the author says, I wouldn't allow too young a child to read this trilogy. That aside, it's one of the best works of fantasy I've read in a long time, definitely not pro-religious but not the work of satan that so many have called it.
B000E41MS6|5.0|This is my first exposure to Doctor Who. Have never seen it before in my lifetime.<br />Iam glad i saw Eccleston as Doctor.<br />Initially though i thought Billie Piper was too fat for the role, i relished her acting and home-look later in series.<br />The best episodes i really liked and i was terrified is the London during Blitz episodes. I so liked the song that i bought the track Moonlight Serenade separately.<br />The Dalek is what shows Doctor's acting at its best.<br />His terrified scream, and his relief, his taunting of the dalek when its laser is powerless are amazing.<br />These are my two favorite episodes. The Slitheen was funny, but not that great.<br />And the initial Earth episode was stunning.<br /><br />I have now seen a few of them different doctors, especiallt the classic The Five Doctors.<br />But none of them match the terrifying intensity of London Blitz or the acting skills in Dalek
B000002O1Q|3.0|This album shows a lot of promise for singers who should have been better received in the music scene rather than just in the film/theater world. For some reason the soundtrack seems to lack the power and clarity of the film version of the songs. Perhaps they were re-mixed or something but to watch the film on DVD and hear the music seems better than what is on this album. Still a great item for film and music lovers.
0143038419|5.0|I felt like I was traveling along side Elizabeth Gilbert on her literal and spiritual journey through Italy, India and Indonesia. I was inspired by her search for pleasure, God, and love in these richly colorful places.   Her stories are touching, amusing and brazenly personal.  Her life is enriched by teachers she encounters along the way who show her how to stop \\"brooding over the past\\" or \\"worrying about the future\\".  One of the gifts she receives is being present in her life.  Another is knowing that being of service to others is the greatest gift of all.    Another book of wisdom and personal adventure is [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]] by Ariel and Shya Kane. This book of delightful stories illustrates an effortless and joyful way to a life of well being without traveling from your sofa.  Both books are filled with compassion for ones self as well as for others.  Whether I travel throughout the world for knowledge, or to my kitchen for a cup of coffee, it's the magic of being there for it that makes the difference.
B000UFAURI|4.0|I like alot of the songs on this CD but don't think it's their best. My favorite song was Once and For All, go figure. But Pretender, Long Road To Ruin are good driving songs. It may be time for Dave to put out a best of, so we can just get the good songs, no filler and some of those unreleased tracks that I think they really excell at. Get this one though to complete your collection. Up the Foo's!<br /><br />2010 Update: Thanks Dave, I knew you would listen to me and put out a best of. can't wait for the new \\"Wasting Light\\" coming out April 2011.

B00006879E|5.0|i really like this cd, it has a fun and funky sound to it which is nice. i do like pretty much every song on this cd...however, i will admit that i do like their 2nd cd better. it's not that this one isn't good, it's just that in the 2nd cd you can tell that they have up-ed their sound and songs. i can't wait to see what they put out in the future.
0143038419|1.0|Wow, what a total disappointment.  What else does this author write because there must be some reason this was so popular? Oprah maybe? Boring, self-serving, another poor me story.  Its rare I want to throw a book at a wall.  You have to be pretty bored to enjoy this book.
B000BCE918|5.0|I can't say enough about the pleasure that comes from the Jurassic Park Series. I knew when I first read the book by Michael Crighton, that Spielberg would take the lead and make a film. He was the only one that I felt could truly make the book come to life. And indeed he did. All the films are visually fantastic and the screenplays are well written. They are, all three, classics for all time!
B0009IW88A|5.0|I love this movie and the soundtrack so much!  It is very relaxing and an absolutely beautiful instrumental!

B0002XNSY0|4.0|I must have seen this \\"black comedy\\" at least one- half dozen times and, unfortunately, it gets less funny for me every time.  The United States was just beginning to accelerate its Vietnam troop strength in 1964, and at age 16, living in suburban Boston, the title of the movie was quickly changed to \\"Dr. Strangeglove\\" in honor of Red Sox bumbler Dick Stuart. I distinctly remember Strangelove's performance as being hilarious, and still do, simply because he's totally, totally  unrealistic.It's the other characters, especially the base commander, the President, George C. Scott, et al who have become more realistic over the years, therefore more scary to me. Remember, in 2007, the United States flew nuclear weapons right down the center of the country, leaving them unattended on a Texas airbase,This morning's Presidential budget includes $70 billion in new defense spending; this despite various sundry plans to \\"wind down' overseas. For years, historical novelist Gore Vidal, now living in Italy, has been harping that money and sex are the true powers in Washington D.C. Care to debate him? In summary, Strangelove the character will always be a personal favorite. As for the movie, it becomes more prophetic, less comedic, more black, with every wiewing.

B00000JY1X|4.0|Stephin Merritt is an amazing songwriter and demonstrates this on each and every album.  69 Love songs is just a great, ambitious concept album both funny and heartbreaking.  I highly recommend this and Get Lost and I and Holiday and pretty much anything else he's done.
B00102FELM|4.0|This release has been available on Best Buys website for a few weeks.  Awesome it is, very powerful sounding and not overly polished sounding.  I was disappointed when I read in other reviews that some great songs have been omitted, but it is still a \\"must have\\" if you like those hard rock groups that were big in the 80's and beyond.  And if you're like me, anything with Michael Schenker is a \\"must have.\\"
B000F0UUIM|5.0|This has to be one of the best westerns ever filmed. The acting is excellent, and the scenery is some of the most beautiful scenery anywhere. Monument Valley is where this movie was filmed, and all thru this movie, the scenery is spectacular. Great story, and great film.

B000H7JCG4|5.0|I started watching in 1990 at its beginning, and I was there at the end in 2000. And now, years later, I watch re-runs on Soap network. That is how good and addictive this show was. Back then, it felt so real and so just like my life, I was excited to watch and see what would happen week to week. Now, I can re-live it anytime. The DVD is so great, everyone should buy it if they loved the show. It really brings back some great memories and some awful ones too, mostly because of the fashion. You look back and you can't believe people actually wore that. All your favorite and non favorite characters are here and even though Andrea really wasn't remotely highschool aged, you don't care. It doesn't matter because all of these actors as a whole created this show and without a single one, it would be a lesser show. The OC has nothing on this. And I really don't think any other 'teen' type show can match this.
B000UFAURI|4.0|Really good album. Once again, they prove their high level of creativity and their diverse talents, without sounding like a totally different band.

6304708491|4.0|Review no. 288. What was this, their second feature film? Classic 1965 Beatles flick, with actually a decent plot to it. Personally, I liked this movie better than 'A Hard Day's Night'. Don't ask me why. Don't believe I've watched this film since I was a kid. Movie centers around some weirdo religious cult and their 'great Swami' leader attempting at ALL costs to snatch a sacrificial ring from Ringo. They try by hiding in a mailbox, a sandwich machine, etc. Several semi-side splitting scenes through the picture. Songs that were bringing back some precious memories were \\"You're Going To Lose That Girl\\", \\"Ticket To Ride\\", \\"The Night Before\\" (one of my personal favorites), \\"I Need You\\" and \\"She's A Woman\\". Heard from a friend of mine and I totally agree that one cool factor about this movie was the way the Fab Four's house appeared to be of average size on the outside but when you step inside, the place is huge. Sort of cartoon-like. Liked the way John (was it?) had his bed in a lowered portion of the guy's pad. A forty year-plus film that hasn't lost much at all through the years. Fun to watch.
0765342294|5.0|I'm not a big fan of science fiction; however, I loved this book.  I read it as a school assignment and wasn't expecting much from it; however, once I started I couldn't put it down.      Ender's Game is an exciting book that keeps you engaged the entire time.  I loved the theme of good vs. evil throughout the book.  The idea that Ender can't trust anyone and is completely alone brings about his individual strength and character.  It is through the sacrifice of his childhood and the comforts of life that Ender understands who he really is.  The characters and conflicts in this book are both realistic.  During the action scenes Card pulls you into the story so you feel as if you are really there.  It is the complex themes and high energy that make this book a page-turner.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|This DVD is absolutely breathtaking.  Every performance is fantastic, the video quality is superb and the DTS soundtrack rocks!<br /><br />Like most people, I first saw this concert on PBS.  The DVD has some additional tracks not shown on that broadcast including a great solo number by Lang Lang.  There is also a nice video montage of images from Tuscany while Bocelli's original version of \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\" plays.<br />The other extras are some backstage and rehearsal footage, including short interviews with most guest performers and a bonus CD.<br /><br />The highlight is obviously Andrea and Sarah Brightman performing \\"Time to Say Goodbye.\\"  The rendition was so perfect you would swear you were listening to a studio recording.<br /><br />The only thing that could have improved the concert was Celine Dion to perform \\"The Prayer.\\"  Heather Headley does a nice job with the song but who can top Celine?
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This doc includes a biographically themed interview with Robert McNamara mixed in with some incredible archival footage from World War II, the Cold War and the Vietnam War. McNamara talks about his academic achievements which led to becoming Harvard's youngest assistant professor. When World War II began the government brought him into the defense department as a strategic specialist who was involved in planning the firebombing of Japanese cites which led to an enormous number of civilian casualities. After a stint working for the Ford Motor Company, JFK chose him to be his Secretary Of Defense. He was involved with the Cuban Missle Crisis. But is, of course, best known for the role he played in the Vietnam War.    McNamara comes across as a man haunted by the past who, at the age of 85, feels he must \\"set things right\\" about his role in US military affairs. He now admits the Vietnam War was a mistake. But still seems to contradict himself while discussing the actions he took. He attempts to cast LBJ as the primary villan and certainly Johnson comes across badly on several of their recorded coversations, including one where LBJ essentially says he wants to kill as many Vietnamese as possible. But McNamara also seems a bit disingenious at times, such as when he attempts to downplay his role in authorizing the use of Agent Orange. He also continually eludes to the fact that no good choices were available and that no one else can really understand the circumstances he was facing.    The main point that emerges for me is that the US government really had no clear understanding of Vietnamese history and that the Vietnamese people saw the US not as liberators but as an occupying force who had come to replace the French as colonizers. It's sort of amazing that so many smart people could have been so stupid. But this movie does an excellent job in putting a human face on people in power. It's not that there is some diabolical global conspiracy, as an earlier reviewer seemedto suggest. But rather that our leaders are simply human beings and are prone, like the rest of us, to failures, weaknesses and grave errors in judgemnent. The difference is that their mistakes become more tragic in times of war, when so many human lives are at stake.
0321544080|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best books on photography I have ever read and read and read. The pictures are better than most books on the coffee table. The photography lessons are worth the price alone. But the stories associated with the pictures and 1 line lessons are the true treasures. If you want to try to understand lighting and know that there are no absolute rules then this is the book for you. Originally I thought that this book was a bit expensive, but the quality of the printed photography is only exceeded by the story on the opposite page. Base on 1 line lessons you want to go onto the next pair of pages to read about the story behind that photo. The written style is simple and easy to follow with on page definitions for those photography tech terms needed for understanding the lighting. Simply outstanding. Thanks to Mr.(s) McNally and Scott Kelby for understanding the value of its contents.<br /><br />Amazon shipped mine in a standard carton, but blister wrapped the book inside with cardboard. Thank you; it was raining in Los Angeles the week it was delivered. Yes, one corner was curled. But reading this book as much as I have these past two days quickly curled the other corner.<br /><br />The peachpit.com bonus pdf addendum for registering the book online was not available at the time I wrote this.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This little film quietly sneaks up on you. The realistic portrayal of 2 people who briefly meet, flirt with the possibilities of romance, and then create music is not much of a story that would attract average American filmgoers, but if you let it take you there, you will be glad for the trip it takes you on. Set in modern Dublin, the film expertly captures the city and the role that music plays in the Irish heart. The music is absolutely astonishing and you will be amazed by the long sequence of music creation that is the heart of this film, and you might, as I did, be unable to get the tunes out of your head for weeks.  Rarely has the creative process been captured as well as in this production.
0525950079|5.0|What a terrific book!  Filled with the historical research and details of a Michener novel such that one can't help but be transported into the time and place, feeling the tempo of medieval life and its coarseness; the fearful and capricious nature of the world then.  I was peeved every time I had to put the book down and would look forward to cracking it open again to learn more about these characters.  DO NOT TAKE THIS BOOK ON VACATION -- unless you're heading to Seattle during the rainy season!  You risk becoming a chair-bound zombie oblivious to your actual surroundings!
0765318741|5.0|When one considers that this story served as inspiration for at least three films, and on reflection, may have contributed to the attributes of heroic figures in a few others, the only real question for me was why it took so long to decide to read the source. While I enjoyed each movie version: [[ASIN:B000WC3A0I The Last Man on Earth]] with Vincent Price,[[ASIN:0790742802 The Omega Man]] with Charlton Heston and, of course, [[ASIN:B00005JPTI I Am Legend]] with Will Smith, I found Matheson's original story superior to each screen adaptation.<br /><br />Robert Neville is not the Ubermensch or any other category of superman. He is an ordinary man compelled to react to extraordinary circumstances. Matheson doesn't state explicitly but infers, nuclear holocaust resulted in the virtual extermination of mankind save the protagonist who, holed up in his fortified home, must withstand the nightly incursions of the undead or the nearly so, who thirst for and require his blood for sustenance.  Each day of this post-apocalyptic existence is a trial, foraging for food, for knowledge and against all available evidence, for the chance of companionship. While Neville is cognizant of the mathematical improbability of his long term survival, over a three year span, he becomes adept at finding and destroying vampires as well as those he suspects of being infested with the bacterial cause, an affliction he discovered and named vampiris.<br /><br />This is a speculative tale of the human condition, with the supernatural as impetus for investigation.  It is the examination of the psychological, the emotional and even the physiological impact on this most tragically isolated being that I found most engrossing. Faced with a life sentence to isolation by the vagaries of chance - he cannot be certain why he is immune - he is driven by a primordial imperative to resist submission to the darkness surrounding him. Neville's struggle is another manifestation of the very basic question of one's purpose in life and whether existence for the sake of existence has any real value. Three times Hollywood has answered the question in vastly different manners than the author intended. This dystopian view offered by Matheson should not be discounted.<br /><br />Obtuse Alert - This edition also contains nine additional short stories that follow I Am Legend.

B000Z27HLS|3.0|I join the other reviewers who were disappointed about the missing and cut scenes that were un-aired on PBS, but a part of the original airing on ITV in the UK.  I purchased Persuasion, which is a part of the same Masterpiece Classic series, and the un-aired scenes were included on the DVD.  Therefore, I fully expected this adaptation to include those scenes and I am unsure why the few minutes were left out.<br /><br />Overall, however, the adaptation was quite good, if a bit rushed, especially at the end.  Northanger is a hard book to adapt for the screen, as the past BBC version exemplifies.  This version is very enjoyable with the two leads capturing the spirit of the roles, and the atmosphere a good balance between the ridiculous and the mysterious.
159102594X|4.0|Since so many reviewers have already summarized the plot (or, rather, the bullet points of the plot to be developed in the next volume), I am not going to do it in my review. I enjoyed the book and I think that most people, who like dark fantasy with interesting, multi-dimensional characters, would enjoy this book - at least as the promising beginning of the series.   Despite the fact that most characters in the book are \\"archetypical\\", they are complex and interesting. This is a welcome break from thin, one-dimensional characters that I encountered in so many other fantasy books. Logan Nine-Fingers - the best barbarian since Conan and Glokta the inquisitor are among my favorites. It is not too often that I read fantasy book not only because of its plot but because I really sympathize with the heroes.   The main reason that I didn't give 5 stars to this book is its length. As in some other new additions to the fantasy world, at least one quarter of the volume could be edited out, to make the story more succinct and tense.     As a post scriptum - if you compare \\"The Blade itself\\" to the \\"Song of Ice and fire\\" by G.R. Martin, you would find many similarities: you mostly can not decide whether you like or dislike the heroes, you'll find it difficult to follow all the twists of the plot and predict how the different stories converge. It is true that Joe Abecrombie is not yet at the level of GRM. But he is certainly an author to watch out, if you are fan of this genre.
037571457X|4.0|The story of a young girl growing up in Iran in the 80s.  \\"Forrest Gump\\" let me see history through a fresh innocent set of eyes and I found \\"Persepolis\\" much the same.  No one should have to live in such an environment, much less a child, yet Satrapi has so much hope, so much fire and spirit in her.  Such and enlightening and powerful story.

B0011ZNAIC|3.0|Golden-Globe nominated \\"Bee Movie\\" has received mixed reviews from the media. Opinion is divided even among the general viewers; some say it is entertaining and funny while others say it is unfunny, even boring. Perhaps this has something to do with the nature of the gags of the film, which contains one-liners and pop culture references (with cameos from Gordon Matthew Sumner aka Sting) as well as sight gags. Or perhaps it is that we need something more to make a feature film, something like a compelling story and credible characters.    Jerry Seinfeld (also co-producer and co-writer) provides the voice for the film's everyman-type protagonist, a bee named Barry B. Benson. The disillusioned hero cannot decide on his work after graduating from college (and he must do the same job until the day he dies). He then flies outside the hive in New York City, meets a florist Vanessa (voice by Renée Zellweger) and sues humans after watching how bees are \\"exploited.\\"     Obviously the four writers are trying to do something original -- the tedium of the bee community that could have been a nightmarish dystopia; a suggested romance between a human and a bee; or a lawsuit that results in unexpected troubles for both humans and bees. All of them have a potential to be a theme for a feature film, but \\"Bee Movie\\" is not aware of that fact.     The film moves quickly from one set-piece to another, without developing these ideas at all. So we know Benson is romantically attracted to Vanessa, but the topic seems suddenly discarded in the third act. We are also told that bees are not supposed to talk to humans, but the rule is soon forgotten in the court room. They may be small things, but it is these details that draw the audiences into the film's world as much superior \\"Ratatouille\\" shows.    I enjoyed watching the film, but that was because I was impressed with the film's colorful visuals and designs, and some of the actions (flying sequences are impressive). \\"Bee Movie\\" is an enjoyable film, but you know this could be much better had it been made at another studio.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|a visionary tour de force that takes the listener on endless magical journeys. The time spent away has served the boys well - as they seem to have mined rich new territory through which to reward their fans. I particularly enjoy the subtle, softer touches on this one that seem to reflect a maturity and confidence not seen in previous work. The experimental handiwork is as marvelous as ever, leaving one easily guessing, and sometimes gasping, at the insightful and surprising creative directions explored. There is real power in this amazing and hypnotic sound. Every Radiohead offering is a unique gift to be treasured at multiple levels: all designed to elevate, or expand, the mind and the soul.<br /><br />It works for me, at least!
B000YENUIG|2.0|This movie could have been better if there were subtitles for the Russian spoken.  There are a multitude of scenes, some seemingly quite important to the movie, that the viewer has NO idea what they are saying.  There is ALOT of Russian spoken in this movie. I was very diasspointed in this movie. The Russian characters were hard enough to understand when they spoke english.
B000002UAI|4.0|Ok, this may not be the best Beatles album but it is still better than 90 percent of what was out there then and now. Filled with great songs, maybe a weak point or two. The problem with judging Beatles albums is that they set their own bar so high that it is almost imposible to get over it. I will say this about \\"For Sale\\"...it has got to be one of the best album covers ever with about the only rival being the Stones \\"Between the Buttons\\".
1416523359|5.0|Mr. King did it again, this time with a romantic edge.  Lisey is a strong, compelling,well-rounded character dealing with the loss of her Pulitzer prize winning husband, Scott Landon.  When a stalker shows up demanding for Lisey to hand over Scott's paper's, the stuff really hits the fan.  Lisey must follow Scott's last \\"bool\\" without letting any of the \\"bad-gunky\\" get in the way.<br /><br />Boo'ya Moon is the cool, surreal setting where anything is possible.  Its beauty is darkened by the laughers of Fairy Forest, and the ominous Long Boy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, a wonderful blend of horror, suspence, and romance that will have you compulsively turning pages all night long.
140120306X|3.0|Having devoured the first and second League of Extraordinary Gentlemen books, I looked forward to this one hungrily for a year.  Perhaps I looked forward to it too much; the antique pop culture references used to be gleeful, and generally supported the humour and characterisation; now, they've become long stretches of impenetrable text and they just get in the way.  We scarcely glimpse Mina and Alan as we leap from Lovecraft to Beat, from Wodehouse to Fanny Hill.      The young Alan, especially, suffers from this.  Except for one good line in the James Bond scene, he's really not given anything to do that reveals his Alan-ness; what is life like for him?  What makes him more than a blonde square-jawed action hero?  We don't know, and I was looking forward to finding out.    Actually, I enjoyed the Fanny Hill with the Beardsley-inspired art, the Wodehouse-Lovecraft pastiche was a laugh (although done before), and I loved the Pornsec Tijuana bible.  I don't condemn Moore for the inside jokes - it's the author's right to do that, even if it does limit the audience - but as someone who was in on it, I didn't find it served the story.      It reminded me of the long stretches of Promethea where we trudged through the whole Tarot deck.  The art was absolutely transcendent, and sometimes the wonderful characters survived the paragraphs of occult exposition, but often as not it felt forced and dry.    Maybe I'm missing the point.  Maybe someone else can read the whole Beat pastiche without their eyes glazing over.  Maybe if I hadn't come to it wanting to know more about Mina and Alan, I would have enjoyed it more.  I still think Moore's brilliant, and not everything he does has to be to my taste.

B000SZLSB2|5.0|As a DJ, I hear alot of different music. A patron at my bar asked me to play him and not having anything, I ran out and got the first CD. I was very impressed with his lyrics and wonderful voice. When the new cd came out I quickly got it and was further impressed by him.     Some of the highlights:    1973- The first single is nice and upbeat and is about a club that opened back in 1973.     Same Mistake- A topic I can relate to, this second single has some of the very best lyrics I have ever heard. This should have been another number one single!    Carry You Home- The third single (Out in march) is sad but very well sung and if the idiot radio programmers will open their ears to James' talent, he will get a hit here!    Give Me Some Love- Definately a great song. He has been opening his concerts with this song and is one of the few more upbeat tunes on the album.    I'll Take Everything- James jokes in concerts that he's had a song played at everyones weddings (You're Beautiful is the biggest song in England for wedding songs currently) and at everyones funerals (Goodbye My Lover) Now he has a song for everyones divorces. Definately a topic I'm familiar with and definately something that people can relate to!    All in all, if you want TRUE TALENT, buy this album. He is one of today's great singer/songwriters. Right along side Jack Johnson, Donavon Frankenreiter and Joe Brucato and alot like singer/songwriters from the past like Jim Croce and Harry Chapin.     James Blunt will be around for a VERY long time!

0345440900|4.0|I enjoyed this book and some of the main themes, such as treating your infant like the little person that he/she is and beginning things as you mean to finish them. The EASY routine is a pretty good base schedule and I have found it (altered a bit) to be helpful for us. I also think that her suggestions for correcting learned behaviors are helpful, although I haven't had to use any of them. That being said, you cannot learn to be a parent from reading a book. You also should not expect to agree with or be able to apply everything the author says. I have been reading books like these to get many different views on childcare, so that I can form my own opinions and/or routines that will work best for my baby. I do think that most parents could benefit from this book, even if you only use one or two of the many tips/suggestions.
B000K15VSA|5.0|There has been so much written about this film. I don't believe I can do it any further justice. Just to say the packaging is brilliant.

Enjoy & add this to your collection, It is a must buy!!! Goes down a one of the best packaged dvdv boxsets.

B0000062Y2|3.0|I've been a fan of this rock opera since Day One, folks.  I even got this soundtrack when it originally came out. . .on LP.  (Probably still have the album sitting in an attack somewhere.)  So I was delighted to recently have another listen to this remastered two-disc edition.  I will say one thing:  Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical definitely reflected the turbulence of the times, those many years ago.<br /><br />Ted Neely.  Carl Anderson.  Yvonne Elliman.  When these artists are on their game, the music is good.  Which is why tracks like \\"Everything's Alright\\", \\"Heaven on Their Minds\\", and \\"Gethsemane\\" are fun to listen to; they are quality music.  Problem is, there are some duds from this soundtrack--much of it carried over from the motion picture--and they are just plain bad music. I had forgotten just how bad.<br /><br />And this is supposed to be \\"remastered?\\"  I was very disappointed with the quality of the audio; much of the instrumentals were either muted or so faded they could hardly be heard.  A rock opera needs bass and guitar and percussion. . .it sounded more like the musicians were punching pillows.<br /><br />So there you have it.  This remastered version of JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR is good in spots, and then pure blech in spots.  It's as uneven as the banks of a river--but it sure brought back a plethora of memories.<br />--D.

Tribal Leadership is a valuable tool to assist any manager become a leader and help channel their efforts as they elevate their tribe to the next productive stage.

B000UPSKO8|5.0|This DVD of the Opera Gala from Baden-Baden is truly a worthy addition to anyone's collection of beautiful singing. The video and audio are excellent. All four featured singers possess gorgeous voices and in top form. The ladies looked divine and performed all their numbers magnificently. The baritone Ludovic Tezier was likewise quite impressive in my first introduction to his considerable talent. However, it was tenor Ramon Vargas who proved to be the rock and big star of the show. Although his voice has grown into a robust, powerful spinto with dark colors, he has not lost any of his admirable and distinctive qualities such as his trademark elegant legato singing, masterful control of dynamics, unerring sense of belcanto style and musicality of the highest order. His burnished bronze served him well in the dramatic Verdi numbers. Not only did he sing the most and clearly garnered the most ovation for his arias and duets, he was chiefly instrumental in raising the excitement level throughout the evening everytime he came out to do his solo or duet. For instance, after Anna Netrebko brought the roof down with the Lehar number and her bag of amusing tricks (seemingly an impossible act to follow), Vargas followed with a rollicking and powerful rendition of Rossini's La Danza in a pretty brisk tempo and demolished the remainder of the house left by Netrebko. It's that kind of a night that clearly belonged to Vargas, the senior of the group. Elina Garanca was sensational in the Spanish number too. The way the ladies looked  and everybody sang made this gala a truly memorable one, and hard to top yardstick for a gala of four in the future.
B00005JPLW|5.0|absolutely stunning.  i lost it when i saw some of the slo-mo fight scenes, so beautiful.  it's not about the violence, don't focus on that.  you need suspension of disbelief & let yourself enjoy it.  it's visually STUNNING and it is never dull for a moment.  gerard butler is fantastic, he blows guys like william wallace in braveheart etc out of the water.
B000002HJD|2.0|As a spoken word collection, Jim Morrison strips away the trappings of pop culture and truly shows the power of his poetry. In a way, it shows a direction he may have taken in performance art if not for his untimely death.<br /><br />But the concept is ruined by The Doors, who took Morrison's tapes and recorded nothing more than doodlings in Muzak, which sadly makes the end result a parody of the Beat Generation. Ultimately, this is for Morrison fans who are looking to complete their library of authorized releases.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I loved the \\"Tudors\\".  After learning King Henry the 8th was my 13th great-grandfather, I was intrigued to know more.

This King Henry \\"Jonathan Rhys  Myers\\" is HOT!!!
0385340540|4.0|Joel Backman has a problem, a real problem.<br /><br />Once a major player in international politics as a high-power lobbyist and attorney, he becomes snarled in a web of intrigue, which includes the failed illegal sale of secret spy satellite technology and the reduction by 14 years of a 20-year federal jail term through an alleged cash-for-pardon plot, courtesy of a disgraced, outgoing president.<br /><br />Add into the mix the mysterious murders of those who know his secrets and the entrance of professional assassins from four nations, whose mission is to silence him - forever - with a covert assist from the CIA, it appears as if Backman traded prison for a certain death sentence.<br /><br />Author John Grisham gives a nod to John le Carre, as Backman slowly begins to evolve a new identity, with the assistance of CIA operatives, in his new home of Italy. But when Backman takes the elements of a classic spy to confront the clear danger, Grisham delivers a wild ride of action and emotions.<br /><br />Through meticulous development of the plot, Grisham shows how freedom is lost in the fog when those strings are manipulated by a puppet master & the consequences when truth gives way to the merging of good and evil on the world's stage.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|There are other reviews here that go into enough detail as to render me repetitive, so I shall dispense with the story summary here. All I can say is that after goodness knows how many screen versions of Jane Eyre, someone has finally got it right. Our proper Miss Eyre is the stoic, reserved woman we've come to love and respect, and yet we see her passions awaken and eventually begin to boil just behind her controlled countenance. We watch Rochester fall so irredeemably in love with her and see his humanity as he toys with her, ostensibly to see if her austere demeanor can crack. (Yes, and how!) The filmmaking is of such quality throughout this film that we hardly realize when we've transcended from watching them feel to actually feeling their emotions with them. While some complain that Toby Stephens is too good looking to play Rochester - not an unreasonable observation - I confess I did not find that distracting. Here is a man who feels himself ugly, who is trying still to find happiness in a life that seems ever to elude it. And Jane. We see every emotion she tries to hide, every prick of rejection, every pang, every triumph, yet it is not overdone in the slightest. We feel she is a living, breathing woman, one we'd like to have known. In short, this film has established the standard by which all other Jane Eyres will be judged - if another production surpasses this one, I shall be surprised indeed.

0060557818|3.0|The enjoyment of this read will depend on the preferences of the reader, if he likes to read fantastic tales in the line of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", where the juicy part lies in the story and the interaction of some particular characters with magical powers it will suit him, however if he is looking to read a captivating fast paced thriller with a plot full of twists and turns and featuring a surprising ending, this is not the book as he will find many chapters. a bit naive, repetitive and tedious and the ending good but somewhat contrived. I would not say, the book is bad, but it is not dominated by an special charm to make it unforgettable.
1591841666|4.0|Just a wonderful little book. Not a how to book, but it contains great reasons to quit or stick with your dreams (or a job). I have found that I am in a dip in my job, I no longer have the passion I once had for my job and career.

0439882826|5.0|[[ASIN:0439882826 Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy]] We gave this book as a birthday present to our 6 year old grandson.  We were a bit concerned because the pop-ups are very architectural and have amazing  detail. We were afraid it might be too complicated for our young grandson. It wasn't!!  He absolutely loved the book!  His father also went crazy over it. It is the kind of book that can be appreciated by a 6 year old or a 60 year old.  This book is an absolute work of art and the pop-ups are amazing!  Some of them are so complicated, it must have taken an engineer to figure out how to make them work. You will want to keep this book forever.
B000WMFZMY|2.0|I remember as a child falling asleep at the Skyway Drive-in trying to make it through \\"El Cid.\\" And now some 40 years later I find myself falling asleep on the couch trying to get through the wooden acting of Charlton Heston, the lamentable miscasting of Sophia Loren and the dreadful overacting of a mediocre supporting cast, all failing to bring life to the preachy, melodramatic script.     The greatest epic ever filmed? I don't think so. That label belongs to the one and only \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" It's war scenes are better; it's cast impeccable; and it's script literate and human. Even David Lean's misfire \\"Ryan's Daughter\\" is a much satisfyling film than \\"El Cid.\\"    I haven't been impressed by Scorcese's films in the past decade and think he has constantly miscast Leonardo di Caprio. \\"The Departed\\" was a rip-off of the last dozen films of Clint Eastwood.    Marty, go back to making films and stop concentrating on being the high guru of film history. If you were impressed by \\"El Cid\\" when you were a boy, you must have been terribly deprived. When I lived in New York, there was certainly more drama on the streets than in this insufferably boring film.    The restoration of \\"El Cid\\" is certainly noteworthy.
B000YA82F6|4.0|As I'm sure you've read from other reviews, Juno is about a 16 year old girl who becomes pregnant and eventually decides to give the baby up for adoption.  I was impressed with how carefully and successfully this movie avoids diving into the morality of teen pregnancy, contraception, promiscuity...etc. On the other hand, I felt like Juno was a bit too flippant about the entire situation (I understand that this was done for the sake of comedy).  If you look at the movie from start to finish, she really had minimal consequences for her decisions which could potentially send the wrong signal to young viewers.    While I thought this movie had oustanding dialog and interesting characters, the last 30 minutes came off as a bit trite to me.  I just don't feel like the \\"I'm-16-and-in-love\\" scenario is really consistent with the Juno we're introduced to throughout the movie and is a contrast to the edgy themes prevasive in the first hour.  Despite this, the movie has great visual continuity and is loaded with catchy, comedic lines.    I would recommend this movie for youth 14 and up to watch w/ a parent or a trustworthy adult.  I think it sets the stage to have insightful conversations about pregnancy, sex, life, emotional boundaries, and high school.
1844137864|5.0|I've been familiar w/ Banksy's graffiti work for years, but never knew he was responsible for so many of the iconographic images that are shown throughout this book.  He challenges people's perceptions and turns 'public art' into a post-Andy Warhol comment on modern society.  The design and layout is also well thought through.  Well worth browsing or buying if you are willing to think about what his art is saying.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|I loved this film, even though it is a dark tale set in the Communist era in East Germany and, before it ends, there's enough tragedy that unfolds to sink even optimistic spirits.<br /><br />What makes this a memorable movie is the larger theme that it works toward, in the end, as a top East German spy sets out to destroy a young couple of pro-democracy activists and their friends.<br /><br />The spy sets himself up high in the attic of their apartment house and becomes an obsessive voyeur -- an image of evil that was true to the history of the era, but nevertheless makes one's skin crawl as we watch the spy feeding off the couple's life together.<br /><br />What happens, though, is that goodness does slowly and patiently work on even the hardest heart.<br /><br />The movie is R-rated, so it may not be an ideal choice for some faith-and-film discussion groups. Preview the film before you use it, if you have concerns about the content.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|In Rainbows is very,very good. My main question is,why is it so short?The disc is only 42 min.Why is that?

Disc's can fit up to at least 76 min or so.Its too short.Very frustrating to find out they released the other songs on a seperate disc.Maybe I dare say $$.But anyway,as to the music on this disc.Big Ideas(Nude) is an old tune.No big deal.But as most fans already know,the song itself is different.They have changed it around.I like the older,live bootleg version better.I saw the band at Radio City Music Hall, April,1998.That is the version I remember.It was the only song they played that night that I had never heard before.And I really liked it and wondered why they hadnt released it until now.And it is changed.It might have fit better on Amnesiac .That disc could have used the help,(Pulk,Hunting Bears,Life In A Glass House,all weak tunes).This discs best moment is Weird Fishes/Arpeggi.And also Bodysnatchers.Talk about a classic rocker.It sounds like it could have been from the Pablo Honey era.All I Need, 15 Steps,Jigsaw and Faust Arp are very good tunes as well.I dont get Reckoner at all.I have read that it is another old song.To me,it sounds like it should have been a b side to Karma Police,or something from 1997.Videotape is....ok, I guess.I know some fellow fans of the band will kill me for that one.But,I'am sorry.Its boring to me.Its like You And Whose Army? You either love it..or skip it.I think Last Flowers would have fit better as an end to the disc.But this is all just my opinion.A buddy of mine, saw the band in Boston when they performed in the spring of 2006.He said they played a majority of the songs released here,including my song, Bangers & Mash.So why for the long delay?I guess maybe it had something to do with their dispute with their old label?Anyway.A solid release,but it is not as good as The Bends,Ok Computer or Kid A.
B000VR824S|5.0|Sometimes an event has repercussions beyond its own timeframe. Festivals are intended to be entertaining, but sometimes that isn't even the case. You need look no further than the Festival at Altamont to find an example of festival-dom gone seriously wrong, but occasionally the stars align in just the sequence, making an event feel special as it is happening, and continue to feel special after it is long over. Woodstock was like that. A few of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festivals have been like that, and the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival was also like that.<br />A few years ago, Eric Clapton helped to fund the opening of the Crossroads Centre, a treatment facility for alcoholism and drug addiction located in Antigua. Proceeds from the festival and the DVD benefit the Crossroads Centre, so the cause can make you feel good while the awesome music contained in this program can make you feel even better. Clapton pulled out all the stops on this one, inviting friends who he felt not only fit the bill musically, but also worked with the appropriate attitude of camaraderie and openness. The resultant mood is apparent from the minute the show starts, and it continues to the very end. Sonny Landreth starts things off by performing one of his flashier numbers, called \\"Uberesso,\\" and he smokes it. Clapton then joins him and their duet is jaw-dropping in its execution. John McLaughlin follows (where the heck has he been?) as does Hubert Sumlin, Vince Gill, Jimmie Vaughan, Albert Lee, Robert Cray, Robert Randolph, Johnny Winter, Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson...and that is just disk one. Special mention should be made of the husband-wife team of Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, whose performance was so good that I felt myself tearing up. Tedeschi is under-rated and under-recognized, as her guitar/vocal performance here clearly indicates. Another touching moment occurs when B.B, King pays a tribute to Clapton's sense of humanity before ripping into a devastating version of \\"Paying the Cost to Be the Boss.\\"<br />Disk two brings out the big guns like John Mayer, Los Lobos, Robbie Robertson and Jeff Beck. If you don't know it already, Mayer capably proves that he belongs on the bill with such magnificent musicians, while Los Lobos and Jeff Beck fully live up to their reputations. At this point, Eric Clapton emerges for his set, and he is in full `Derek & the Dominos' mode, with Derek Trucks playing like a virtual Duane Allman, while the double drumming rhythm section provides enough drive to thrust the band into the next county. The night is full of special guests and special moments, but perhaps the premier special moment happens when Steve Winwood joins Eric Clapton for a run through some of the material that they made famous together nearly forty years ago as Blind Faith. Buddy Guy closes the event, and he plays with such intensity and fire that you'd be forgiven to think it was his show. All in all there's approximately four hours of guitar-based music on these disks, and hardly a dull moment. `Crossroads' is a must for all fans of blues-based rock and roll guitar, but it also required viewing for all fans of blues-based rock and roll.

0765342294|5.0|I approached this book nervously.  Whenever I hear a lot of hype about a book (Harry Potter comes to mind), I am very very nervous that I will end up being sorely disappointed.  I am glad to report that I found this book delightful.<br /><br />It's hard to describe exactly why this book appealed to me so greatly.  Perhaps it was the fact that it was eminently READABLE (there's nothing more frustrating than unnecessarily complicated prose).  Perhaps it was the simple, straightforward plot line.  Perhaps it was the fact that it was, in a sense, a \\"game\\" all along.  Most likely, it is all of the above, not to mention the fact that it manages to strike an emotional chord frequently, and without feeling burdensome.  All I know is that I couldn't put it down, and I can't remember having read a book so fast in my life.<br /><br />Five stars, without reservation: not because it's the most immaculately-crafted piece of literature in the English language, but because it doesn't need to be.

While the references to technology are outdated, it still packs a punch as it describes the suffering of interns and patients.  I do NOT like the sexual references to nurses but then again, thats the way thing were when this book was written.  At least we are portrayed as being caring and smart. It gives a good overview of the maturation of our medical population as they go through schooling.

B00003CX9E|5.0|At the opening of Orson Welles' 1941 film CITIZEN KANE, a dying old man drops a snowglobe as he whispers his last word \\"Rosebud\\". Some two hours later we learn that this puzzling utterance was the name of his beloved childhood sleigh. If this mystery was all there was to the film, I would be angry at the number of cartoons that have spoiled it. Luckily, however, \\"Rosebud\\" merely sets up the skeleton of the film. When a reporter goes to interview those who knew the deceased, the real drama of the story turns out to be the rise and fall of newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane (played by Orson Welles himself).<br /><br />Based on William Randolph Hearst, Kane is an inheritor to a great fortune, yet he chooses to work at a minor newspaper, turning it into the leading daily of New York City through abhorrent yellow press methods. Being able to create the news itself in determining what goes on the front page only feeds the fires of his megalomania. Driven to believe in his own greatness--while he simultaneously craves the love of those around him to validate himself--Kane goes from a popular man of the people to an eccentric recluse with two failed marriages and no friends left. As he sits in his vast estate, surrounded by an art collection he never even unwrapped, Welles convincingly relays the moral that possessions don't buy happiness.<br /><br />I initially found the film difficult to appreciate in some aspects of production. The transitions between scenes are primitive, and the make-up used when Welles and a couple of others play old men is not convincing. However, the quality of the screenplay is more than sufficient to make up for the limitations of early 1940's film-making. The acting is superb as well. Though I find Welles more gripping as the younger and sociable Kane than the old recluse, many of the other actors play their roles with perfect naturalness. Surprisingly, many of these actors had never appeared on film before, which makes their achievement all the more impressive.<br /><br />Evidentally no pristine transfer of the film exists. That's a real shame, but nonetheless the film is enjoyable even in its shoddy video quality. Writing reviews like this is somewhat unnecessary--CITIZEN KANE is such a legendary film that if you enjoy cinema you'll seek it out regardless of what I say.ive.

If you thought Amputechture was moving in the right direction, you might like it. I, for one, want the old Mars Volta back.

0790731452|5.0|I believe that Tim Burton deliberately included the deus ex machina (in this spoof of \\"aliens invade earth\\" movies) to redeem Slim Whitman (finally) from his special level in hell, where he has languished for inflicting \\"Indian Love Call\\" upon the human race (which is more painful than listening to a Vogon recite poetry ( [[ASIN:B000A283AW The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Widescreen Edition)]] [...] ). R.I.P., now, Slim).<br /><br />Mars Attacks had been around for over ten years before I even knew that Tim Burton was the creator of it. I had taken one look at the cover (what have we always been told about judging covers?) and turned away, not interested in the least. Then I made the dual discovery (very recently), of just how many big name actors have parts in it, and Tim Burton was the creator (perpetrator, some would say). I love Tim Burton mainly because of \\"Big Fish\\", but also \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\". I haven't made a point of seeing all his films, because I am not a fan that way. But I have enjoyed a ton of science fiction films over the years. This one is a continuous string of end-to-end clich&eacute;s from the \\"aliens invade (visit) earth\\" genre: virtually every line, character, situation, camera angle, musical motif, has been given loving satirical treatment in this wonderfully silly movie. It is my favorite \\"Bad movie, well done.\\" In that regard, I think it is almost perfect. I actually like it better than \\"Galaxy Quest\\", and as a closet Trekkie, that is admitting a lot.<br /><br />P.S. I can't believe that nobody, NOBODY!? on Amazon has reviewed this movie yet. I think I really DO live in the Twilight Zone.

B000WQ9UA8|4.0|At this point in time, it's very difficult to separate Britney Spears the tabloid fodder from the music, I mean, she's a pretty pathetic case at this point. Stories come out seemingly every day about her never-ceasing decline and at this point it's pretty pathetic. But nevertheless, Britney managed to put out a new album last Fall, and when I saw this at my local library, I couldn't resist picking it up.<br /><br />\\"Blackout\\" (12 tracks, 44 min.) starts off with the 'come-back' single \\"Gimme More\\" which actually sounds pretty good (but by now has been trashed by Britney's disastrous performance of it at the VMAs some months ago). After that, though, the album descends into a pretty robotic electronic mode, and it just doesn't cut it for me, check out \\"Piece of Me\\" and \\"Radar\\", which sound flat. \\"Heaven on Earth\\" is better, reminding me of Giorgio Moroder/Donna Summer in their hey-days. The best track of the album follows, a mesmerizing \\"Get Naked (I Got a Plan)\\", which could make a great single, but for the silly title which is sure to turn people off. \\"Toy Soldier\\" is another track that stands out, but there are too many so-so tracks on the album that simply don't go anywhere. The lyrics that the songwriters have dreamt up for Britney address a lot of personal issues, in particular being the target of the tabloids, but it doesn't help the album.<br /><br />In all, this is not the disaster album that it might have been (such as the Paris Hilton album was), but it's not also the great come-back album that it could have been. Where Britney goes from here is a question mark, I mean, she has a lot of personal issues to deal with that are a lot more important than music. I saw Britney in concert a couple of times years ago, and Britney could've been the next Madonna, but that is very unlikely now.

B000RGSOR8|4.0|Once in a while, a new voice or sound comes seemingly out of nowhere, and this is certainly one of them. Amy Clark, the one-woman band behind St. Vincent, has been active in the music scene for years, including in the Polyphonic Spree, and now delivers her debut album.<br /><br />\\"Marry Me\\" (12 tracks, 44 min,) brings eclectic sounds somewhat reminiscent of Feist, but with a different twist. A blazing \\"Now, Now\\" kicks things off. \\"Your Lips Are Red\\" reminds me of early Bjork. The title track is a pensive piano-driven 'ballad'. On \\"Paris Is Burning\\" you feel like you are transformed into to early Paris 1920s cabaret but with an electronic twist to it, just great. Other highlights include \\"The Apocalypse Song\\", reminding me of some Fiona Apple; the pensive \\"We Put a Pearl in the Ground\\"; and the closer, a jazzy-like \\"What Me Worry\\". In all, quite an impressive debut album, and I can't wait to see where she takes things from here.<br /><br />I had the fortune of catching St. Vincent last Fall in Chicago on her tour in support of this album (she opened for the National). She appeared solo (mostly with electric guitar), and put on a mesmerizing performance, just loved it. I can't wait to see her on the road with a full band, which is supposed to happen this Spring. Sign me up! Meanwhile, \\"Marry Me\\" is highly recommended! And if you wonder which radio station plays St. Vincent, look no further than WOXY, the internet-only indie-rock station (\\"BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll!\\"), playing the best music in the country, bar none.
B0012QK8OE|5.0|Hey, cool! They gave arguably the best progressive rock ever made (Okay, so I've heard, like, fifteen that weren't made by Yes) - and one of rock's all-time classics - a reissue job, and a good one too! This review is based on the original, but the remaster is most definitely worth investigation. Not only do you get the whole original album, which is fantastic, you also get two bonus tracks: an early version of \\"Roundabout\\", and the group's glorious reworking of the Simon & Garfunkel hit \\"America\\". You know how the original song is a nice little folk-rock hippie travelogue ditty? Well, here it's remade as a full-out, ten-minute progressive rocker. And it's amazing. Don't ask me why it wasn't put on the original album. So anyway, the original content on the album is... well, let me go over it. The two best songs are the two eight-minute, riff-filled, multi-part epics. First is \\"Roundabout\\". It starts off with just Steve Howe on acoustic guitar, and you know what? I like that a lot. Then Jon Anderson comes in with his nonsense lyrics, and newcomer Rick Wakeman adds his trademarked million-and-a-half kick-butt synthesizers, and then it starts rockin', and then it gets funky, and there's this beautiful Jon Anderson choir bit. Then it's back to the acoustic guitar! Oh yeah, they also restate the acoustic guitar theme about halfway in. Anyway, the other is \\"South Side of the Sky\\", a dark song about freezing to death that starts off with stunning heavy-metal riffage from Steve Howe before moving into this awesome instrumental section where Wakeman stretches out on an acoustic piano, Chris Squire plays a great bass behind him, and Jon does another Jon Anderson choir. I like that. And then, once more, the group rocks out. And not just in a \\"relatively, for Yes\\" rocking out - that stuff's heavy enough to be Led Zeppelin. I love that song. And you know what? Even if it were just those two songs and a bunch of complete crap, I'd still recommend this album. Thankfully, though, it's not. For one, each of the band members gets their own little spotlights, and they're a lot of fun. \\"Cans and Brahms\\" is a weird synthesizer adaptation of a Brahms symphony, and is probably the weakest song on this album, but let us not forget that it's still a Rick Wakeman keyboard solo. \\"Five Percent for Nothing\\", a funky drum solo, isn't exactly great either. But put together, those songs total two minutes. And, like I said, they're fun. But I love Jon's \\"Jon choir\\" \\"We Have Heaven\\". And surprisingly enough, someone chanting \\"Tell the moon-dog, tell the march-hare\\" overdubbed several times can sound good when done properly. Even better is Steve Howe's gorgeous classical guitar showpiece \\"Mood for a Day\\", and I like Chris Squire's funky theme song \\"Fish\\", too. He takes his bass and overdubs it several times, and it sounds like a guitar in places. \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" is the only real pop song here, and it's a cool tune, a jumpy, jerky proto new-wave track. Out of the full-length songs, only \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" disappoints. I certainly do like it, especially the riff-filled introduction. But it never matches that introduction - there are interesting passages in it, sure, but not enough for ten minutes. Whatever, there's a lot of good keyboard playing all over it, and the chemistry between the band is fantastic. This really represents a peak for Yes, along with Close to the Edge, Yessongs, and The Yes Album, and it just may be the best album the group ever did.t's not.

B000VI6T6K|5.0|There are certain moments in rock history that are just monumental and this is one of them, Jimi Hendrix's coming out party to US audiences at the legendary Monterey Pop Festival in June, 1967.<br /><br />\\"The Jimi Hendrix Experience Live at Monterey\\" (10 tracks, 43 min.) brings the band's performance at the festival it its totality. After a quick announcement from the Rolling Stones' Brian Jones, the band crashes in with \\"Killing Floor\\", a ground-scorcher of a song. \\"Foxy Lady\\" follows and after it Jimi delivers some great stage banter, as he does throughout the band's set, making this such a delight. The band's cover of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is a gem. After a great \\"Rock Me Baby\\", Jimi asks the audience to indulge the band for fine-tuning his guitar, \\"Let us tune up because we care\\", what a great statement! The set closes down with \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\", which Jimi announces as the next single to some out (following the hit \\"Hey Joe\\"), and it ends with the now legendary \\"Wild Thing\\", featuring the guitar burning, which you can hear on the CD.<br /><br />Couple of thoughts as I was listening to this: for one, the audience's response was timid at best, you can hardly hear any crowd reaction between songs. For another, this is the Jimi Hendrix Experience at its best, nevermind the many other live recordings out there. It wasn't possible at that time to register or recognize the importance of this live set, but this is a true defining moment in rock history. In a way, it has been cheapened by the overwhelming attention that the guitar-burning segment has gathered, but the full set as heard here just demonstrates what a defining moment this was for Hendrix and indeed rock history.
B00007LTIC|4.0|Rick Wakeman returned, and if you ask me that's a very good thing. I have nothing against Patrick Moraz, but is he Rick Wakeman? No. That church organ part on \\"Parallels\\" is cool, and Steve Howe plays a mean guitar solo. And then Jon Anderson gets up there and shouts nonsense. I literally can't pick out a single word of lyrics on that song. Not like anyone listens to Yes for their lyrics in the first place. But the attack on that song is fascinating. It's one of their most relentless rockers, up there with the \\"rock\\" parts of \\"Roundabout\\", \\"South Side of the Sky\\", \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\", and the entirety of \\"Siberian Khartu\\". What, you thought Yes couldn't rock? HA! The title track also shows that this group is, in fact, quite capable of rocking out. It's kind of like southern rock, actually. But it kicks total butt! Yes doing southern rock... you'd think it would be a dud track, but happily that is not the case. The riff rules, and the keyboards rule as well. It's enough to make it the best song on the record, in fact, and a well-deserved hit for the group. I also enjoy both the dippy (but still great!) ballads. \\"Turn of the Century\\" is Rick Wakeman at his best. Go ahead, listen to that and try telling me Rick Wakeman wasn't the best keyboard player on the progressive scene, which in turn made Yes the best overall band on that scene. And \\"Wondrous Stories\\" has one of the prettiest melodies in Yes history, even if the lyrics are... well, Jon Anderson lyrics. And then, just when it looked like they had another fantastic album along the lines of Fragile, Close to the Edge or Relayer on their hands, they blew it. Specifically, they blew it by letting Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson get crazy with the cheese whiz for fifteen minutes. And by \\"getting crazy with the cheese whiz for fifteen minutes\\", I mean \\"recording `Awaken'\\", which features such horrendously dorky lyrics as \\"Master of light, all pure chance as exists cross divided in an all encircling mode oh closely guided plan awaken in our heart\\" and \\"Master of soul, set to touch all impenetrable youth, ask away that thought be contact with all that's clear. Be honest with yourself, there's no doubt, no doubt\\" and, best of all, \\"AWAKEN SUNS HIGH STREAMS THRU AWAKEN GENTLE STRONG DREAMS REIGN HERE\\". Yes is a great band, but their lyrics really irritate me, because they try way too hard to be impenetrable poetry in the grand tradition of Bob Dylan. But it doesn't work, and I'll tell you why: giving us pseudo-universalist nonsense does not give you Bob Dylan lyrics. It gives you gibberish. And Rick Wakeman doesn't help, adding ultra-cheesy pianos and polymoogs and so forth.

B000XUOIQ4|4.0|Last night I printed up some frame grabs of the new letterboxed Aristocats DVD and compared them to my full frame Laserdisc.<br /><br />The new DVD adds more picture to the sides, mostly the right side in the shots I compared, but it does crop off some picture from the top & more from the bottom.<br /><br />Neither ratio shows the entire picture as it was filmed.  Both ratios are acceptable.  HDTV owners will prefer the letterboxed version, square TV owners may prefer the full frame version as these will fill their screens.<br /><br />As for the movie, it falls short of being a classic. The story drags at times and the xerography animation gives the film a 'pencil test' look.  Well, that is because Xerox had developed a process to transfer the pencil tests<br />to animation cells, removing a step in the animation process.  I don't dislike this style, it is a style unto its own, this is just not 101 Dalmations or Jungle Book (which also used this style of animation).

B000ZK4466|5.0|I have been listening to The Bedlam in Goliath nonstop for the past week. It is one of those cds that is so unique, that even though I've listened to it 20 or 30 times, I find something new to like after each listen.       I first got into The Mars Volta after hearing \\"The Widow\\", and I thought that song was great. I never listened to any of their music after that though, and decided to buy The Bedlam in Goliath after listening to the samples on iTunes. Man am I glad I did. The best songs are Goliath, Metatron, Ilyene, Wax Simulacra, Ouroborous, and Conjugal Burns. Really though, there isn't one bad song on this album.     I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of bands that like to push music in unique ways. All these guys are fantastic musicians, and although they don't have the best song structure, their creativity is so strong on each song that it just makes for a truly enjoyable listening experience.
1844137872|5.0|\\"Nobody ever listened to me until the didn't know who I was\\"  - Banksy    I've always been a fan of street art. I am not going to argue that every tag is beautiful, but some definitely are, and I anyone to point out a visual medium that engages the public more than graf.    Still, a lot of it is pretty boring. Kids writing their names on walls can only hold one's interest for so long. Banksy, on the other hand, is a lot of things. Childish, hilarious, often time brilliant, but never boring. He is the most important street artist working today, and I highly recommend you at least look at this expensive art book in the store. It's amazing.    Using stencils, balloons, posters, markers, traffic cones and whatever else comes to hand, he has created some amazing work. He has hung his own works in major art museums, and he traveled to Palestine to do a number of works on thewall that separates the West Bank from Israel.    The work isn't always good. Some of it is just childish, and some of it is standard graffiti where he's just pissing on a wall to mark his space, but some of it is down right genius.

B000UBMZ4S|5.0|I wasn't sure if the new version was going to be worth it, but the HD DVD transfer was amazing.  I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen, all the visuals were stunning, complimenting an already excellent story.  If you don't have the HD version is is a must own.
0920668372|5.0|I have a many siblings and we watched our mother get sicker and sicker every day for many years. In the beginning of her sickness she would read this book to us every night before we would go about our daily chores and dinner routine. We would all crowd into her bedroom and settle on her bed and floor and listen to her read it. We even recorded her reading it. When she became so sick that she couldn't speak anymore, we still gathered in her room and played the tape of her reading all holding our own copies of this book. If our mother could have come into our rooms and rocked us to sleep or protected us from our nightmares it was when we heard her read this book. Even in sickness and death she will continue to read this book to us and I know that even when I am fighting in another country that she is holding me. I brought a copy of this book and her reading to the Middle East with me. Now I have it here and my children listen to my mother read it every night before bed, just like I know my siblings children do as well. I cry every time I hear the tape, and I hope many more families make wonderful memories with this wonderful book of love that goes everywhere.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|From the unforgettable, exquisitely beautiful and haunting \\"lament\\" that brackets the movie like two bookends, to the equally unforgettable \\"lines\\" sprinkled throughout (such as \\"I am just the voice in your head telling you what you already know,\\" and \\"being victims of the holocaust does not make you decent.\\"), to the skill with which each scene is handled, we know from the start that Munich is going to be \\"very high\\" art, indeed.  But most importantly, we know it because of the way it takes a facile emotional theme -- the raid on the Olympic Village in Munich in 1972 -- wrings all of the cathartic emotional content out of it, and then once it is completely drained, turns it back in on itself so that the moviegoer can see that his emotions have been tricked into looking back in the mirror at a reflection of his own future diminished humanity.<br /><br />Thus, the underlying message of the movie is that: Terrorism is one challenge; losing our souls trying to fight it, is quite another one, and arguably a much larger challenge. Put simply, in a terrorist run world, unless the more civilized protagonist continues to hold himself to a higher standard, the most likely outcome is a world of greatly diminished humanity.<br /><br />In this larger sense, the movie then is not what it seems on the surface: a mere strumming of the familiar chords of sympathy for the Israeli fight against terrorism. Instead, at a much deeper level it is a cautionary tale about what can happen to the American soul, and about how the American mind must finally comes to grips with the new existential challenge of our times, terrorism. But it is about a much deeper fear than just terrorism itself; it is about the collective fear that we all share: That if we are not careful, in the process of trying to fight terrorism (as Israel has itself failed to do), we too might lose what is left of our own moral souls and with it, lose also our humanity, and all of our cherish values and ideals to boot. Thusin \\"Munich\\" Israel is more a psychological \\"prop,\\" a \\"screen\\" indeed a \\"mirror,\\" for the U.S. to see itself better in this post-911 world, a mirror against which America can finally begin to reflect on how being on the \\"receiving end,\\" instead of on the \\"dishing out\\" end of terrorism may eventually play itself out. Munich is about America's future, not about Israel's.<br /><br />The movie begins simply enough as just another updated \\"Western,\\" with \\"an elite extra-legal secret team\\" and \\"Arab terrorists\\" substituting respectively for \\"cowboys\\" and \\"Indians.\\" The secret team is hired by its government to hunt down the Arab terrorists one-by-one; and they do so with relentless and ruthless efficiency. However, after several such clandestine murders of revenge, somehow, the air begins to seep out of the vigilante group's enthusiasm for pursuing their quarry. In the process of hunting down the culprits, they are forced to see themselves in the larger frame into which they have been placed: In order to stalk and find them, they are forced to humanize their quarry. The terrorists all have names and addresses, and families too.  They go to their kids PTA meetings and piano recitals, read and write poetry, fight for humanitarian causes, etc. Just as the extra-legal team begins to humanize and stalk their quarry, they invariably begin to see themselves in a different light. They begin to see their patriotic task for what it is, \\"making state sponsored terrorists out of themselves,\\" and in the process, it dehumanizes them in the same way that they have dehumanized their opponents.  As a result of this psychological role reversal, they begin to question their role, their mission -- their cause.<br /><br />They do this even before they, \\"the hunters\\" discover that they have also already become the \\"hunted\\" -- fingered no less by the same spotters who sold them information on the whereabouts of the terrorists. When they finally realize that they have descended into another dimension of morality, an amoral world where they are just expendable pawns in a much higher more immoral and more corrupt game being played over their heads, it is too late. They discover much too late that they have been sacrificed to their own fates, in a game from which there are no safe havens, or respectable or even moral exits or retreats. Several of them are killed the rest condemned as \\"expatriots\\" to a life on the edge of sanity.<br /><br />Like its domestic companion, \\"The History of Violence,\\" Munich is layered, smart and timely. Easily, Five Stars.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|This 1st installment of the Kisssology series was a joy to watch.All the footage is the original line-up in the 70's.Some of the sound quality is a little off but what can you expect it's from the 70's.Great footage of concerts and TV appearances.Number one highlight of these DVD's a drunk Ace Frehley on the Tom Snyder show just laughing it up while mainly Gene has a look of disgust.Bonus disc I got was in 1977 @ Madison square garden in N.Y.C.Definitly the best one of the 3 and I would highly recommend it.
B000031EGV|5.0|[[ASIN:B000031EGV Jumanji (Collector's Series)]]    This is as entertaining and fun today as it was year's ago.  While there are a few parts of the movie where it is evident that the technology used in the special effects was not as good as it is today it does not take away any of the enjoyment.  This is a fun family movie!

B00005MP58|4.0|I did love this adaptation and I agree with everyone that Firth played an excellent Mr. Darcy - However, it did drag on a bit. There were parts that could have been cut out, as they were in the newer version with Keira Knightley, that were needed in the book obviously, but in my opinion not the movie. Other than that, the chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy was spectacular, as it should be, and it was beautifully filmed and very true to the book. Definitely a must-watch if you love Austen.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is the BEST MOVIE EVER! Well, maybe not 'ever,' but you get my point.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Although I know many people say the Colin Firth/BBC version was better (and i DID love it as well as Firth as Mr.Darcy) - this was better. This was cut down to a watchable size, with the best parts intact. I loved Keira Knightley as Lizzie, although I will say Firth was better as Mr. Darcy than this actor (not to say that he doesn't do very well as well). Overall, it was perfect.. just as I want pride and prejudice to be portrayed.
B000077VR3|5.0|It is rare that a movie causes me to cry, and this one does every time. The acting is flawless, the music beautiful, and the story cuts right to the heart. I recommend this to anyone who believes in true love.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|I have seen every version ever released. Each one is great. This \\"Final Cut\\" has finally got it right. It is too bad there are few large screen theatres to show a film version in today. I will now wait for the UltraVioletRay Disc in 5220p on my 220 inch Ion Projector to see it any better. The case and toys are are fun addition to the party.
B00104W8T6|3.0|This soundtrack has several quirky songs with a sound and lyrics that provide a nice change from the usual.  I see a couple of reviews that deride this sound as nursery rhyme, or sing song, and they have a point.  Still, it's a pleasant alternative from the usual pop-rock or light-rock.  If you liked this sound in the movie, you'll like it in the soundtrack.    I have two serious quibbles.  Several of the songs are re-treads from the 70, 80s, or whatever.  These particular songs weren't great then, and they haven't improved with age.    The other complaint is when talented artists allow politics to degrade their work.  Kimya Dawson is the star of the sooundtrack, but her \\"Loose Lips\\" song is a winning song that's trashed by a crude, throwaway \\"F-ck Bush and f-ck this war\\" line.  There are lots of eloquent and artistic ways to voice the common yearning for peace or the particular pains of the Iraq/Afghanistan battles.  The expletives in this song are not one of them.  Creatively, it's the pits.  Politically, it comes off as a spoiled youngster declaring that she's way too cool to worry about Jihad fanatics.      Too bad.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I am very upset that I didn't see this on the big screen.  It's great on DVD but I imagine the cinema experience would have been even more incredible.  This is such a fantastic musical movie, and whether you're a fan of the Beatles or not, you can't help but fall in love with the music and the characters.  It's set during the turbulent Vietnam War protest-era and it's told brilliantly.  The characters names are picked from different Beatles songs like Lucy, Jude, Sadie and Jo-Jo to name a few.  There are more than 30 Beatle's songs that tell the story of Jude and Lucy, such as Let It Be and All You Need Is Love and obviously, Across The Universe.    Joe Cocker makes a cameo as does Bono in a trippy scene with him singing I Am The Walrus.  I cannot tell you enough just how brilliant this is.  It's so much fun to watch and you can tell how much detail and passion must have gone into the making of it.  You can't help sing along throughout the movie and it's very very enjoyable.  I highly recommend it to anyone, even if you aren't a Beatles fan.  I love the extended music sequences in the bonus features (there are actually some other fantastic features too that make this even more special).  Go get a copy now.  You'll love it.

I am just now getting used to the song Gloria. There was just something with that one , It did not click with me.<br />She will be missed. I know one day when I get to that wonderful place called HEAVEN, there will be a joyful concert for me right in front.

0143038419|5.0|This book is extremely well written and will keep you wanting to turn the next page. An autobiographical that we all fantasize about - just taking off a year and traveling the world. My wife loved it and we both stayed up late reading it. Highly recommended.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I had heard absolutely nothing about this movie.  I was asked to watch it with a friend recently and it was the best hour and a half that I have spent in many months.  The videography was exceptional and the characters were truly amazing and real.  I love the beauty and inspiration in this movie.  Any real musician will appreciate this story and any one that is aware that life is not a coincidence will understand and be grateful for the synchronistic values in the way this story plays out.  The music is very refreshing and heartfelt.
0765357151|2.0|This book is vastly different than the movie, and there's a reason. The movie producers didn't want their movie to suck. About half way through the book, the story ended, then the author started writing short stories that had nothing to do with the book.<br /><br />So you have this fantastic vampire story that has tested time, then suddenly BAM brick wall. After the brick wall, you have a dozen short stories about voodoo, a man who magically wins carnival games, and coming of age stories where a kid is shocked because she experiences a rave for the first time. Oh no!
B0002IU988|5.0|This is an incredible rock album; Shed my skin and Metalingus are aural perfection. I won't lie and say I was a fan of Creed; I enjoyed the music when I heard it but never went out of my way to spend money on it - the musical arrangements were great but the vocals never captured my attention long enough.<br />That can't be said of Myles Kennedy. I am in awe everytime I hear him sing. The passion and musicianship in Alter Bridge is inspiring and worth a listen. Buy this, you won't regret it.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|My family is Scottish, so William Wallace was always a household name. His story is amazing and this movie truly follows it well. The only thing not 100% true is the love affair with the French princess, but it was for the sake of the movie. Besides that, it is very accurate. It's very violent for children, so I would not recommend it for them, but it's well made. I would give it 6 out of 5, because it shows how those wonderful English were to my ancestors.
B000N3AWDE|5.0|As this purchase was in a foreign language, I could not easily find it locally.  But I was certain Amazon would have it and they did.  After the purchase there was one 'glitch'.  The product had a defect; the last song 'skipped'.  I thought there would be a problem with it's exchange since I had opened it, but I was wrong.  Amazon was wonderful!  They had my exchange within a couple of days.  I printed out a return label and the process could not have been simpler.  The new exchanged CD works perfectly and I could not be happier with it.  I've always believed that one does not have to speak a certain language to enjoy the music in it and this French CD of Celine Dion is absolutely beautiful.  I sat next to David Gategno and his mother at Celines next to the last concert in Las Vegas (Dec. 14, 2007) and found out he wrote 3 songs on her new French album.  After getting his autogragh, along with his mothers, I had to acquire this CD.  I am glad I did.  Katie Kelly, Modesto, CA
B000HWZ5X8|5.0|Released in 1990, this was Robert Plant's fifth solo album (not including the Honeydrippers).  The original CD was 49 minutes, and the sound quality was very good, especially for a CD from 1990.      This is a remastered reissue (which,to be honest, I haven't heard).  I don't think that there could be much improvement over the original, but the mix could be a little different.  There are 3 bonus tracks that might make this worth getting even if you do own the original.    Manic Nirvana was the follow up to Now and Zen, where Plant had developed a new sound and style.  Much of this was driven by his new collaborator, keyboardist and composer, Phil Johnstone.  It is nothing like Led Zeppelin as someone suggested.    The CD does not start great.  The first few tracks sound like clones of songs from Now and Zen.  They are good but nothing new or exciting.  But, the CD just keeps gettting more interesting as it goes along.  It is like a mixture of progressive hard rock, and new wave.      I really like the album, but it is a little dated sounding.  You put it on and you can pretty much pinpoint the year it was recorded, based on the sound.  It is not a bad thing, but it certainly isn't a timeless album like some of the Led Zeppelin albums.    CRAPPY COVER ARTWORK, though.  Looks like something from K-Tel or one of those TV sales.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Amy Lee has an amazing voice and can fill her songs with emotion that is rarely matched.  I purchased Open Door for my husband since he is an even bigger fan of Evanescence than I am. He was not disappointed and listens to it in the car on his way to work.  Her best song on the disk is \\"You Never Call Me When You're Sober\\" in my opinion as it showcases her to her best in my opinion the music video for it is great as well.<br /><br />I didn't rate it a 5 because I felt it fell just slightly short of her previous release.  While it was better artistically that artistic vision suffered for the lack of consistency on the songs in meter and length.  A few of them felt disorganized and difficult to follow or just incomplete, as if they needed another verse or two to be finished.  I hope that their next release will receive that additional polishing that this one was lacking.  Either way you can be sure that I will purchase it and find out for myself since even with it's flaws \\"Open Door\\" is worth every penny.
0307387151|3.0|I have never read a book by this author but decided to try Atonement since the movie was out and getting such great reviews.  Honestly, I thought the book was mediocre.  Not one of the worst I've read, but not one of the best either.  The beginning was hard for me to get into...however, it made more sense once I read the end.  Some people seem to love it, some hate it.  I say buy a used copy and find out for yourself.

1594489505|2.0|Looking back I wonder why I felt so differently about The Kite Runner, a book I thought was one of my favorites.  Because I'm a woman?  Because it was a different story than I'd read before?      I think it was because, in that book, there was hope.  I expected to like A Thousand Slendid Suns as well.   But I didn't.  I couldn't finish it.  These women glimpsed hope where there was none to be had.  Every day of their lives was more demoralizing than the day before.  I couldn't believe more of them didn't kill themselves.        Though this author is so talented, I'm surprised somewhat by the global praise from everyone.  It just seemed unbalanced to me.  The unending brutalality and oppression was just too much.
B000063WDH|5.0|Two guys from Akron Ohio spilling their hearts out through very raw guitar riffs. The lyrics are pretty good too...
1594489505|4.0|I'm not going to rehash the whole story line of this novel.  If you want to read that go to the product information page there's plenty of info there about this book.<br /><br />I will say that this is a story about women's lives, about love, survival, endurance and hope.<br /><br />I was very surprised by what a quick read this was, I finished it in two and a half days.  Once I was into the book I couldn't put it down, I needed to know what happened in the lives of these women and I stayed up past my bedtime so I could find out.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I really liked this book or not...It definitely deserves 4 or 5 stars.  But I found it to be gutwrenchingly painful to read.  I typically love gutwrentching but this was a little too much for me.  And perhaps that's because this was SO realistic.  I know that Mariam and Laila are characters that Khaled Hosseini created but I have no doubt that there are women who endured or are enduring lives very similar to theirs.<br /><br />I felt like I really couldn't imagine what it would be like to live in a place of constant unrest, where you are fearful most of the time, where neighbors collect pieces of their children from the streets after they have been killed...it's almost unfathomable, it's mind boggling to imagine what that would be like.<br /><br />This is one of those books that makes me feel lucky to have been born in America and very thankful for the life I'm able to live here.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|Friends has been recognized as a great series for a long time.  One thing I was afraid, by looking at the product pictures, that there was only 6 seasons.  Because they have the boxes designed based on the 6 stars/Characters.  They have broken the seasons down into these six character boxes.   I have not been able to look through this 100% but 90% that I have looked at has been no different from purchasing the individual seasons.  If you have a choice buy the box set because it will be cheaper, but if you already have several seasons just finish out your collection.

B00000E3HM|5.0|GOLD STANDARD for Mahler 4th.  Well, I must admit, that I am a Furtwangler and Celibidache aficionado.  How come then that I am writing a review on Karajan performance?  Some explanation is in order indeed: especially to my fellow Furtwangler fanatics.    Once one of my dear friends and fellow Furtwangler fans asked me what I think about Karajan. Her expectation was to hear that Karajan is a bon-bon, sweet conductor with no understanding of music.     My answer was this:  Furtwangler is a revolutionary: not in a defiled bourgeois sense, but in a sense of Beethoven: he perceives the music as a shear force of nature, not beholden to any RULES. That's why he is the perennial interpreter of Beethoven.    Karajan on the other hand is the antithesis of revolutionary, subsequently the enemy of all real Beethoven and Furtwangler. He is the ARISTOCRAT. In many pieces of music that he performs he might seem not to have the insight. But what he invariably has he performs everything BEAUTIFULLY, even if it goes against the nature of the piece of music that he performs.     In short, Karajan is one of the conductors I am always interested to hear, because even if I don't agree with his interpretation, it is never dull, and always is beautiful.    Now, I advised my friend to hear this very performance with my Sennheiser and let me know what she thinks. She was stunned!    This is absolutely the best Mahler 4th ever, by anybody, ANYTIME. Anyone, that doesn't appreciate Mahler, even after hearing Adagietto from 5th, I give this recording to hear. It works every time to gain to converts.       One of the reviewers is absolutely right! And I hope this partly explains his assertion.    The same way that I would say that the Beethoven 9th apogee is the Furtwangler performance with Berliner Philharmoniker,  the most ecstatic Mahler 4th is this one!
B000UX6THK|3.0|I am really enjoying watching Twin Peaks, but it's kind of like one of those songs you used to love ten years ago, or maybe even five years ago, you loved it, it was so awesome, but if you hear it today somehow it just seems embarrassingly lame, silly and dated.  Some of the acting (like Kyle McLaughlin's) is excellent; most of the characters are endearingly eccentric and the story is consistently creepy.  But I also now realize how excruciatingly slow the pace of the story was, even without the commercials and waiting a week between episodes it moves e-x-t-r-e-m-e-l-y slow.  Still, it's Lynch and clean enough for TV and that's rare enough in itself to be worth the purchase.  I haven't gotten to the special feature discs yet so possibly this review is premature but I was emailed and asked for it. The log lady intros are super grainy; I think they are meant to be that way but it's still distracting each time. Here's to corny old songs!
1594489505|5.0|Excellent, just excellent. Sad, touching, sweet, heartbreaking, brutal, troubling, a help to understand their culture and religion.  Great sympathy for the women of Afganistan. Great author!
1594489505|5.0|This is Khaled Hosseine's second novel about troubled Afghanistan.  He is probably better known for his excellent book, The Kite Runner.     A Thousand Splendid Suns is far more than merely a novel designed for entertainment.  The drama is useful in understanding a contemporary Islamic society, one having tasted liberalism in politics, but one which has swiftly on numerous occasions slipped into anarchy or worse.    As with The Kite Runner it gives insights into the central Asian culture of Afghanistan that personifies a people about whom little was previously known or known only through woefully inadequate news reporting.    A Thousand Splendid Suns starts in the 1960s world of Afghanistan, a peaceful nation at the time.  We must remember that Afghanistan throughout its history is a nation that has been invaded frequently standing as it does at the geographic crossroads of central and eastern Asia, south Asia and the Middle East.  It is a story of the turmoil that began in the late 1970s with the rise of the communist regime of Najibullah and proceeds to the near present.    It is a story of love; of victimization; of unimaginable familial hardships and national violence.  It is a story of victims turned to heroes, and victims who fall to their own devices.  This reader had to ask himself who really were the victims?  Perhaps one of the biggest victims was the Afghan husband Rasheed.  Did Rasheed's self contempt from his failures not breed his deplorable actions against the heroines of this story?  I could not help wonder if Rasheed was a symbol of the entire country of Afghanistan.    In any event this story, with self sacrifice that makes one think of Dicken's, A Tale of Two Cities, has its heroes and heroines throughout; real people no doubt in real times.
055358894X|5.0|\\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" arrived last year with all the usual hype.  But it also arrived with much more than the usual merit.  This book is the book we've all been waiting for.  It's the one that cooks up a brand new fantasy world starkly different from anything seen before, and stews it together with outstanding plot, characters, and writing.  The next great fantasy author is here in the form of Scott Lynch, and with luck he'll be with us for years to come.    \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" is about crime.  The title character is a con artist who leads a small band of crooks through stealthy schemes to rob the rich nobility.  Their tactics are amazingly clever, well worthy of what appears to be a high fantasy \\"Ocean's Eleven\\", complete with disguises and even glittering skyscrapers.    That, however, is merely the beginning.  Half way through, \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" turns in wholly unexpected directions.  Abandoning its caper tale roots, it becomes a serious drama in which the main characters confront pride, arrogance, and their own mortality.  The closing stretch of the novel is one of the best ever, mixing astounding action sequences with equally amazing character-based drama.  It's certain that Lynch outpaces almost any living fantasy author in this category.  It's equally certain that many authors of supposedly 'real' literature should read \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" to see how a master does it.    I don't have space to adequately praise Lynch's skills with prose.  He excels in every category, from dialogue to action to humor.  I can point out that certain tactics which seem stale and pointless in other fantasy novels spring to life here.  Lynch employs non-linear storytelling, flashing back from the main story to episodes in the characters' childhoods.  The flashbacks are not only witty and charming, but they blend seemlessly into the story.  Likewise with the map of the city at the beginning.  Maps may often be seen as a staple of weak fantasy, but Lynch'svivid descriptions bring every part of the city to life.  No word is wasted, nor is any place within the fictional setting.  His understand of space and of how it affects everything within the tale is fantastic.    My praises could go on, and doubtlessly they will once I read the sequel.  For now, I want to mention one last thing.  Lynch begins each section of the book with a quote from a great poet or some other worthy source.  This is another trick that looks smug and pompous in other books, but works magnificently here.  In particular, the quote chosen for the final section is a masterpiece all by itself.  But enough about that.  Buy \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" and get to work.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|If you are looking for incredible music on this album, listen to \\"Innocence\\", which is beautiful and well done. I wish the rest of the album came anywhere close to this song, but it doesn't, with the possible exception of the songs she co-wrote with Evan Taubenfeld. If you really love Avril, you'll follow her wherever she goes and you won't care too much that most of this album is immature and, well, obnoxious; but for people who can appreciate her songwriting skills and are hoping for some great show of talent, she doesn't let it loose on this album. In short, she left her maturity at home. What's weird about this is that \\"Innocence\\" is overwhelming in it's musicality and maturity. She has it, folks, she just chose not to use it for most of these songs. Heavens only knows why. Hopefully she'll decide to go in a more mature direction for her fourth album because if she releases another album like this one with a couple years of marriage under her belt, she'll look awfully silly. Cross your fingers that she realizes that.
B000SSPL2Q|5.0|This box contains nearly all of Sibelius's major orchestral music, in superb performances under a noted interpreter of Scandanavian music, in collaboration with a virtuosic ensemble that is thoroughly steeped in the idiom, and vividly recorded.  As such it represents remarkable value for a modest investment.  Similar sets abound--Berglund/EMI, Barbirolli/EMI, Ashkenazy/Decca, Davis/BMG--but this one, in my estimation, trumps them all.<br /><br />J&auml;rvi knows this music inside out, yet conveys the freshness of new discovery even in such hackneyed works as the Second Symphony, *Finlandia*, and the *Swan of Tuonela*.  He has the measure of Sibelius's northern sensibilities, but doesn't overdo the bleakness; on the other hand, there is a forthrightness, even a toughness to his interpretations that well suit a composer who fairly early in his career turned rather decisively from lush romanticism to a more restrained neo-classicism.  Thus J&auml;rvi resists overplaying the rhetoric in the finale of the Third and the Fifth, while he vividly evokes the chilly landscpes of the Sixth, Seventh and *Tapiola* (whose central \\"storm\\" episode is as terrifying as one could wish, even if, at a rather brisk tempo, it doesn't build as inexorably as Karajan's stunning EMI account).  I also appreciated J&auml;rvi's headstrong but nuanced First and Second, which convey a sense of eager anticipation that make them sound newly-minted.<br /><br />A generous serving of tone poems and shorter orchestral works, including the *Four Legends* (but regrettably not the *Kullervo Symphony*), benefit from J&auml;rvi's crisply articulated rhythms and cleanly delineated textures.  *Night Ride and Sunrise* sweeps one along in a whirlwind of passion--yet it is passion under control, and that is exactly right for Sibelius.  *Andante Festivo* is as haunting as one could wish.  *Luonnatar* is spectacularly well sung, and it's cosmic vision is communicated with extraordinary vividness.<br /><br />The one relative disappointment for me was J&auml;rvi's appropriately introverted but less than involving Fourth Symphony.  But my impressions might have been shaped by an abiding admiration for Karajan's and Maazel's more overtly expressive accounts of the score.  But even when he is not firing on all cylinders, J&auml;rvi is never less than elegant and always atmospheric in Sibelius--and that counts for more than superficial excitement.<br /><br />So don't hesitate to purchase this set if you're seeking something like a \\"basic library edition\\" of Sibelius's important orchestral music.  You won't be disappointed.  J&auml;rvi is more interesting than Davis or Berglund, leaner and meaner than Barbirolli (to be sure), better played and recorded than Sakari (though not by much), far more idiomatic than Ashkenazy's \\"Slavic\\" or Karajan's \\"Prussian\\" Sibelius (much though I enjoy the results of those misconceptions!).<br /><br />In short--a best buy, despite the absence of a booklet with annotations.i's appropriately introverted but less than involving Fourth Symphony.

0143038419|3.0|This is not a BAD book. Gilbert is ambitious and brave -- not only to take such a journey, but to write about it so candidly. With that said, I was mainly turned off by her tone of self-importance and had to largely skip over the section on India because... to be frank, I just didn't care. With her disclaimers on why she won't tell us the cause of her divorce to why she won't disclose the name of the ashram or guru, I wanted to tell her -- no one even asked. Too defensive and too presumptuous for my taste. Maybe Gilbert fans want to know every aspect of her life, but, as this is my first Gilbert book, she comes off as being too self-important.
B000PD3LAI|4.0|A sad journey through the heart and minds of Adam Levine and the band.<br /><br />I listened to the samples here once I heard Makes Me Wonder a few times on the radio and on tv. I wasn't impressed in the slightest. I was shocked at how they \\"changed\\" and thought they needed to get \\"back on track\\".<br /><br />Thank goodness something last month told me to give them a shot because I liked Wake Up Call once it became a single.

0316067598|1.0|First off, this is not an indictment of the SEALS or Marcus Luttrell. I was in the military and have read countless military-history books. My criticism of this book focuses on the writing and editing. Luttrell should have received more help from co-writer Patrick Robinson and the book's editor. If you're looking for excellent prose, such as that written by Stephen Ambrose, Rick Atkinson, or Evan Wright (just to name a few), this is not the book for you. You will be very disappointed, as I was. One example: Much ado is made about the \\"huge C-130 Hercules, a giant turbo-prop freighter.\\" If you've ever seen a C-130, you'll know it's far from huge and it's never referred to as a \\"freighter.\\" It might be noisy, but it's quite small compared to a C-17 or C-5. So where was the editor on this? Was any fact-checking done? Another example: \\"Astern of us lay the fevered cauldrons of loathing in Iraq and nearby Kuwait ....\\" Come on. \\"Fevered cauldrons of loathing\\"? This is eighth-grade prose. Again, the editor was asleep at the switch. I was very much looking forward to reading this book, but I just couldn't make it much beyond this point. Luttrell's story was not served well by this writing/editing team.
0060853980|5.0|Who would have thought that Angels & Demons would be so funny or so friendly?  When I first read a blurb about the book I thought it might be interesting so I put it on my wish list.  My best friend bought it for me over the holiday.    What a great book & so entertaining!  This is not for any kind of fundamentalist who takes the bible literally, this is for very open-minded individuals who think for themselves.      The story was rivetting, the apocolypse is going to be hysterical!  The characters are so appealing with their own histories & futures that you just cannot put this book down!    A completely enjoyable end to the world :)
B000ZK4466|4.0|The Mars Volta is a band that defies expectations, even with this, their fourth full studio release.  For me, their travels to this point has been full of ups and downs.  Their first album blew me away.  Their second took a slight dip into self-indulgence but had a few choice cuts that kept my interest.  I'm absolutely enamored with their third release that melded the best of the previous two albums.      Now, we have The Bedlam in Goliath, an album about an ouija-type talking board dubbed \\"The Soothsayer,\\" and it is their most bombastic and unsubtle album, yet.  Things start off terrific with the \\"hit you in the face\\" opening of \\"Aberinkula\\" and I was immediately in love.  That loved continued with the second song all the way to the fifth, which I had heard during their online promotions.      All of these songs were fast-paced, loud and full of booming choruses, a melding wall of sound and so many damn things going on at once, it felt like I was physically being assaulted by the music.  In a way, it feels representative of how the album's creation and \\"the curse of the Soothsayer\\" troubled the band.  The story goes that after finding the ouija board, The Mars Volta became cursed.  Their drummer left the band, the lead singer needed surgery on his foot, the lead guitarist's house flooded, the sound engineer had a nervous breakdown and left without leaving notes as to where everything was...it was an eventful and bad time for the band.    And so it is with their album.  I really like the first half, with its bombastic noise and wall of sound...unfortunately, that's all there really is.  Don't get me wrong, The Mars Volta is still as technically proficient in their instruments as ever and can create music unlike any other I've heard.  This time, however, it was a bit too much.  And they unfortunately (for me) delved back into some self-indulgent themes of Francis The Mute.  The things that annoyed me about it (the noise, for instance, that ruins the ending of The Widow with its 2+ minutes of nothing) seem to be making a comeback this time.    Additionally, after the bombastic and generally excellent beginning five songs, the last seven kind of ran together and didn't really coalesce into the excellence I was hoping.  It's not a bad album; in fact, it's still above average.  But, it's not as good as I was hoping or expecting.  They have mentioned their next album is being called \\"their acoustic album\\" and maybe that one will be more to my liking.  This one, though, feels as tumultuous and, at times, obnoxious as their dealings with the cursed ouija board probably was.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|My introduction to Paramore was from the radio, where I heard \\"crushcrushcrush\\" several times.  When I found out who it was, I did a little investigating on YouTube and here at Amazon and found out that they had much more to offer than that song getting all the airplay.  I ended up buying the album.  To this day, crushcrushcrush remains my favorite song by them, but it was a good idea to buy the album because the rest of the songs are really good too.  Hayley Williams is quite young, but a very powerful and accurate singer.  The entire band is solid, tight, and often exhilarating.  What a rush!  Five stars for Paramore's Riot.
B0011NVC98|2.0|Director Robert Zemekis, who brought you the spectacular The Polar Express, now brings you the thousand-year-old vicious Viking story Beowulf. Unfortunately its' strikingly, vivid visuals are almost too stunning and magnificent for its' own good.      I am sure many of you were forced to read the graphic story in a high school English class, and even though I am told it departs from the story so much, I will not go into great detail about the plot. It's main premise is a demon Grendel is terrorizing a village and the King calls for a hero to kill it, offering half the gold in his kingdom. Enter Beowulf who comes from afar to the rescue, but gets sidetracked by Grendel's mother. How could you not get sidetracked by a digitally-manipulated nude Angelina Jolie.      I was so sad after watching this because I really wanted to like it. There were several things that made this so awful. The script was so horribly dry and dull that it took the life out of the characters. Also I felt that the animators spent so much time and effort on the close-ups of the actor's face (primarily Beowulf's), but not enough on their movement and action. The moment the characters would make any movement I felt like I was watching a glorified computer game, and I almost expected to see a digital scoreboard appear.      Now some of the good points: The cast is a first rate ensemble including Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Robin Wright Penn, Ray Winstoned, and Brenan Gleeson. The other point that made this film tolerable was the fact that you have never seen anything like this before one screen. The animation is so original that for a while you will be simply delighted just to watch just for the visual grandeur, but that fades off rather quickly. This actually causes the downfall as you are so enthralled by the animation that you loose sight of the story and characters. It almost seemed like the filmmakers were so excited with their new technology that they got lost in the animation forgetting the story, script, and characters.      After I watched Beowulf I thought about the amount of time and money ($150 million) they spent producing it, and I felt it would have been so much better if they had simply shot it real life and made it into an exciting blockbuster adventure rather than a two hour, computer game look-alike animated epic.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|All the time I was reading this book, I admit I was terribly envious of Elizabeth Gilbert -- not just because she'd performed this wonderful \\"making lemonade from life's lemons\\" act, transforming herself from a depressed and lonely divorced New Yorker into a world traveler who relishes nearly every moment of her year in Italy, India, and Indonesia -but also because her writing is so wonderful, and so seeminly effortless. She finds the most amazing descriptions and comparisons and metaphors to describe cities, people, situations, and (oh gosh, especially!) food. For that reason alone -- the wonderful writing -- this book is worth reading (although, like I said, it did make me envious of her).    If you are looking for something like \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" or \\"The Swimming Pool\\" this isn't it. But if you love good writing, read this book.
B000YA82F6|5.0|\\"You should've gone to China, you know, 'cause I hear they give away babies like free iPods.\\" This is just one of the many, many original, hilarious lines in this poignant comedy that sidesteps just about every clique and forges ahead to become one of the most original pieces of work to come out in a long time!<br /><br />The plot may seem simple, but do not let it mislead you. Juno (played brilliantly by Ellen Page) is a sixteen year-old girl who gets pregnant with her boyfriend Paulie (played by Michael Cera) and decides to give it to a couple (Mark and Vanessa Loring, played by Jason Bateman and Jenifer Garner) looking for a baby to adopt. The film covers all Four Seasons, and Juno's entire pregnancy.<br /><br />What makes Juno so different from all the other teen comedies is the combination of Diablo Cody's script and Ellen Page's exciting, energetic performance as the heroin. Most essentially though is the script with such sharp, clever, non-stop dialogue, that I found myself anticipating the lines whenever a character opened their mouth to speak.<br /><br />As I mentioned Ellen Page's performance is what makes this film work so well, but she is greatly aided by one of the best supporting casts I have seen in a while. This includes: Jenifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Michael Cera, Allison Janney, J.K. Simmons, and Olivia Thirlby. Everyone one does so well together on screen and stays in their appropriate amount so the story is never overcrowded.<br /><br />This is a sweet, funny, enjoyable film filled with a delightful humanity.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Took a chance on this on blind faith... (pun intended). I loved the fact that while they are the same people, they are NOT the same artists they were in 1969. They tackle material that must have faded in their memory with vigor, and obviously had a good time in the process. Highlights for me were We're Going Wrong (stunning) and Stormy Monday, which has the absolute BEST performance by Clapton I've ever seen or heard. It is breathtaking, and it's CREAM. I would have purchased the DVD just for this one cut alone. Play this DVD on the best system you can find, the audio is superb, and the camera work and editing are spot-on. Buy this DVD. Period.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|Almost a decade later, director Shekhar Kapur follows up his critically acclaimed Elizabeth with Elizabeth: The Golden Age which includes the ethereal Cate Blanchett reprising her role as the famous regent.      Now firmly settled into her throne, this second film follows Elizabeth facing the crisis of the invasion of the famous Spanish Armada. In addition to this she also has to deal with an internal crisis as she starts having great affection for Sir Walter Raleigh (played by Clive Owen)--a pirate staying at the court. She obviously is unable to marry him being that she is the Queen, and a queen who has already refused many offers of princes from all of Europe.      This is a glorious, sumptuous epic with award-caliber production. The cinematography is some of the best I have seen since Titanic, and the sets and costumes are magnificent. The sweeping score blends all the scenes together perfectly. Cate Blanchett's performance stands out from the star-studded cast as she reprises her role with a ferocious intensity.      I have only one complaint with the film. It is the fact that the director changed Elizabeth's character into a woman publicly longing and pursuing a man in ways that reminded me of a giddy love-struck teenage girl with their first crush. It seemed out of character for a regally mature, sophisticated queen who should already have experienced such things and outwardly have moved on.      This film is quite different in tone as the other one. It is much tamer (garnering a PG-13 rating compared to the R rating of the other one) and more entertaining with the love story and the climatic battle at the end. Even with the change and the rather major complaint the film manages to be a stunningly produced, acted, and compellingly wrought epic piece of cinema. It makes me hope Kapur will make the third of his planned Elizabethan trilogy.
1594200106|5.0|If I could give this book 6 stars, I would gladly do so. I haven't enjoyed a book this much since I finished the Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield. Both authors rely heavily on a gothic flavor, but each handle it in a different and unique way.<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is first and foremost a book about books; it opens with a journey to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. It is also a story about the love of books and how a book can take you on journeys that you never dreamed possible, if not in its own pages, than on the journey of discovering more about a book or its author. It is also parts literary mystery, murder mystery and love story; Zafon seamlessly weaves each of the threads of this novel into a tapestry, both beautiful and haunting in its telling.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|Only the masterful Tim Burton could turn such a twistedly morbid tale of depravity into a shockingly entertaining musical with enough blood and guts to rival Saw.      Sweeney Todd, based off the broadway musical, is the story of Benjamin Barker a successful barber whose life is destroyed when a corrupt judge (played by Alan Rickman) falls for his wife and has Benjamin sentenced to life in order to get her. Benjamin escapes and returns to London in the opening of the film only to find that his wife is dead and his daughter in the custody of the Judge who sent him to prison. Wanting nothing but revenge he joins forces with a woman he knew in the past, Mrs. Lovett (played by Helena Bonham Carter) who helps him open a barber shop above her meat pie shop. His plan for revenge soon spirals out of control as he starts killing his customers and then sends them below to be used in Mrs. Lovett's pies.      Johnny Depp does an excellent job singing, but Helena Bonham Carter does the best job in the film. Her voice is stunning and she has the widest range or emotions to go through in the film; all the while creating a morosely charming character. The supporting cast also does very well singing and acting including Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Jamie Campbell.      As all Tim Burton films, this is a visual delight. He uses that same fake-looking blood from Sleepy Hollow which helps tone down the stories graphic content. He also plays with the coloring and lighting, covering everything in bleak, dreary grays and ashes to set a tone of the overwhelming despair.      This is a magnificent film, and my only complaint or more the reason why I did not give it a higher rating is because it is a musical. I personally do not like musicals (Phantom of the Opera and Sound of Music are exceptions), but still just the acting, and grand filmmaking turns this musical into a engaging film.
0060855924|4.0|The Color of Magic is Terry Pratchett's introduction to the concepts, characters and ideas that he will build on to make his Discworld series. It suffers a little from what I call \\"first-book-in-a-series syndrome;\\" the book isn't bad, but the author is clearly learning his own characters and ideas, and it's all still in a formative state. I enjoyed it enough to want to move on and try the next book.    Part fantasy, part satire, part comedy, The Color of Magic is a fun, quick read that doesn't take itself too seriously at all.
B00005JPUN|3.0|The Invasion, a remake of the 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers, is actually a very well made and executed remake. Greatly aiding this remake is Nicole Kidman's performance which helps the film along immensely as well as the intelligent script and stylish camera work.       After a space shuttle explodes on its' re-entry back to earth pieces of it litter the neighborhoods and fields below. The particles of debris bring a deadly virus that spreads quickly from person to person before scientists are able to retrieve it. Meanwhile Nicole Kidman plays Carol Bennell a psychiatrist whose starts realizing something is wrong. Daniel Craig plays Ben Driscoll a doctor and friend of Carol's who is coming to the same realization. When Carol finds a mysterious moving piece of visible organism on one of her son's friends, she takes it to Ben to have it checked out. The story quickly picks-up from here and then speeds up even more, stopping only very briefly for the conclusion.      I am normally not a fan of sci-fi/alien/virus movies but, this was done so well through the performance of the actors, and the filmmakers that it draws you in at the opening scene! I really liked how you do not see the virus spreading. Almost everything is seen through Carol's eyes so you do not realize the how bad the situation is until almost everyone is in infected. And as Carol flees from them, running into more wherever she turns, it slowly draws you into this horrifyingly claustrophobic world, and holds you, building the tension, not letting go until the end.      As I said Nicole Kidman does a wonderful performance as always, Daniel Craig is charming as ever, and Jeremy Northam plays his role chillingly well as the ex-husband of Carol.      Overall a extremely well made, well acted remake, that at the very end turns almost insightful.
0743298020|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is one of those rare books that come along, grabs you from the first page, won't let go until the very end, and then leaves you wanting more. Diane Setterfield's debut novel follows the dual stories of Margaret Lea, the daughter of a bookseller, and Vida Winter, a seclusive author who has decided to tell her life's story to Margaret Lea; a life full of history, secrets and mysteries.    Compared to some of the greatest works of Gothic romance and mystery, you'll find a little bit of everything here: secrets, mysteries, murder, madness, obsession, ghosts. Setterfield brings all the elements familiar to the genre together into her own masterfully written tale, creating a book that is both spellbinding and unforgettable. A true pleasure to read.
B00005JPSM|2.0|No Reservation, although an entertaining film does not have the slightest trace of originality unlike the many gourmet dishes Kate cooks up. It follows the formula or outline of most romantic comedies so closely it feels pre-packaged and almost every scene is entirely predictable.      It follows as story of a famous chef Kate, played by the always-stunning Catherine Zeta-Jones, who's sister has just dies in a car accident, forcing Kate to take in her sister's only daughter, Zoe (played by Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin). While taking time off to deal with the loss and adjust to having a child at home, a new chef, Nick (Played by Aaron Ekhart) is hired by the restaurant. Once Kate returns to work she feels threatened by the new chef, thinking he is trying to take over her kitchen and career. As the two work together they find themselves falling for each other.      The cast does a fine job, Catherine Zeta-Jones sensually sophisticated, Aaron Ekhart well I have to admit I felt he was sort of picked because of his perfect \\"model\\" features but he still does a fine job. Abigail Breslin does a wonderful job reminding us why she received that nomination at such a young age.      The main problem with this film was its' script. I thought the characters weren't developed quite enough. It almost seemed as an outline example for romantic comedies. As I watched the final scene I smirked having already figured it out a long time ago.      One thing that helps partially salvage this movie is the pure fascinating culinary imagery, and despite all the negativity in this review it is still a moderately entertaining film for when you want something simple, brainless, and light. It does deliver some fresh laughs and let's face it Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Ekhart...need I say more...I mean talk about hot couples!
0425200450|5.0|This is only the second book by Agatha Christie that I have read, but it cemented her as one of my favorite authors. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express. As it is only the second of her books that I have read, I can't be sure, but I can see a pattern to Christie's writing; she seems to definitely draw from a certain formula in her writing. Even with what appears to be a predisposed pattern to her writing, these are still enjoyable reads.    Murder on the Orient Express is a Hercule Poirot mystery, one of her more colorful recurring characters. Like The Mysterious Affair at Styles (the only other Christie book I've read), Poirot finds himself in an unexpected situation; traveling to Paris on the Orient Express, there is a murder, and Poirot is pressed into service to try to solve the mystery before the killer can escape!    There isn't much thinking involved on the reader's part; most of the clues are clearly presented, but Poirot doesn't make the connections until the end, but he clearly illustrates how the crime was committed and who did it and how he came to the conclusion.    Agatha Christie obviously enjoyed writing her books, as that enjoyment is passed directly onto the reader. 5 stars!!
B000ZN8036|5.0|Like plunging into a deep pool of water, Into the Wild, slowly hypnotizes you into a state of mesmerizing euphoric awe, and holds you with its' subtle power until you surface, gasping for air.    Into the Wild is a stunning masterpiece adapted and directed by Oscar-winning actor Sean Penn. It is a true story which makes it all the more powerful.    Having successfully completed his grueling four year degree, Chris McCandless is at a pivotal point in his life. His wealthy parents want to buy him a new car and pay for Harvard Law tuition--many kids dream--but Chris has other plans. Not even saying goodbye he sets off on a soul searching journey into the wild. What follows is his journey intercut with flashbacks and voiceovers from him as well as his sister. There are so many poignant scenes of such raw, real emotion that you can almost feel them.    In other hands this could have been a dreary nature film, but Sean Penn handles the material masterfully as he blends the nature voyage with flash-backs, and haunting voice-overs. Emile Hirsch gives an astonishing performance as Chris, balancing a fine line between maturity and a child-like innocence to everything new to him. Everyone in the supporting cast does a wonderful job, including Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt, Catherine Keener, Jena Malone, Kristen Stewart, Vince Vaughn, and Hal Holbrook. The combination of Sean Penn's adapted script, faultless direction, and Emile Hirsch's astonishing performance, is an Oscar-deserving collaboration.    I cannot remember the last time I was so affected by a film. It has the type of power that seems emanate from the screen. It took me away from the day, theater, life completely until you are completely wrapped in the story hanging on everything that happens without a care for what else is going on, forgetting any worries or thoughts. I almost feel inadequate to write a review because this was such an astounding film that I am worried any selection of words will not give it the praise it deserves. It is so mesmerizingly, hypnotically, haunting, moving and affecting beyond words, all I can do is beg you to go out and witness it for yourself.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|I saw this film on Blu-ray and really enjoyed it.  Hollywood did a high tech schmaltzy version of the epic poem Beowulf starring Angela Jolie and Anthony Hopkins.  I didn't see it.  This film neither has a stratospheric budget or shock and awe special effects, but it has fine actors, good writers and fine direction and cinematography, telling the story of Beowulf & Grendel as Hollywood with its arrogant suits and risk averse formulas could never produce it.  This Beowulf & Grendel will reintroduce you to classic filmmaking.    Not only is it well worth a watch, this film is well worth a place in your film collection.
B000YA9R3C|2.0|Paul Thomas Anderson once again fashions an original and ambitious film of layers filled with challenging themes that, despite producing an occasional scene of brutal realism, fails to be that good. This two-hour and forty-minute story of one man's greedy ambition and his unwavering quest for wealth at whatever cost, reminded me of a Charles Dickens story where all the characters are caricatures--and that is not a good thing.      Daniel Plainview is an oilman who is seeking to make a fortune by finding a piece of real estate with a profitable oil well. He has no family except for a baby boy he adopts and quickly turns into his young prodigy. He is approached by a boy, Paul (played by Paul Dano), who tells him of a ranch where there is such an abundance of oil it is seeping out of the ground. This is all Daniel needs to hear before setting off to find it. When he arrives he quickly goes about buying up the ranch as well as all the surrounding land and then with a crew starts drilling. He does run into some confrontation with Eli (also played by Paul Dano) the brother of Paul. Eli realizes the oil is worth something and wants a share of the profit for his church which he is minister of. Daniel agrees to this, but once he strikes oil and starts raking in money, he completely ignores his deal with Eli as his true colors are shown and he slowly turns completely bitter to everyone around him.      This is one of those films that seems to easily garner many award nominations and termed \\"masterpiece!\\", but when you go see it you are left wondering if you saw the same film. There were simply too many flaws in this film to be even close to a masterpiece.      To start, as I said before there are moments of true brilliance and some scenes were so engrossing that you would hang on every motion and line of the characters only to be shut back out the moment the scene was over or the acting would become so ferocious that serious parts were almost humorous. PTA, the director, seems to have this style of pushing his actors almost into the territory of over-acting (as was the case of Tome Cruise and Julian Moore in Magnolia).      The production was nothing new or magnificent. The cinematography was mediocre almost annoying at parts as it showed close-ups for extended periods of time. The score was a \\"nail-on-chalkboard\\" type with every note out of tune and absolutely no melody just repetitive clicking, banging, or stringing contrasted against the silence of the plains.  For the story to be almost three hours long it was too focused on the main character, so that the supporting characters (none of who are women) appear more like those extras who just have a few lines before they head to the next studio. Because of this fact I felt the reality was taken out of it as Daniel Plainview seemed to exist in his own world were there was no society and the people surrounding him were so vacant of any character that everyone did as he said. Also the lack of a female character (supporting or main) was a big mistake.      I give this film points for trying to bring a message, but there were too many messages and themes that got mixed together so at the end I was wondering if it was trying to show the affects of greed, money cannot buy happiness, capitalism vs. religion, etc. All of these themes are good but when they are not made clear enough.      Lastly I feel that since it is not an entertaining film, it is more a character study filled with different themes to critically analyze (which I LOVE) the director should have chosen a different actor and story to illustrate those themes instead of oil drilling, Daniel-Day Lewis and nearly three hours of screen time (half of which has Daniel covered in oil beyond the point of recognition).
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|All four had an Important yet different theme that made every difference in their charector as indiviual films.  This is why they were far more than just \\"Buddy Cop or Action\\" films, as they (The Movies) indiviually evolved to the level of Family. Mel grows beyond his death-wish in the first film. In the fourth movie, Danny Glover answers history when he gives aid to those being sold in to slaveory.    I really lover the sentaments brought forth in this searies, cover to cover.  It was thoughtful entertainment, two words one does not generally find in the same place.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|Original--that is the word, rarely used today, which describes Stardust perfectly. It is exhilarating to finally see such a fantastically original film. It revives the magic of older fairy tale films, and turns the ridiculed \\"happily ever after\\" endings into a delight!       Ian McKellen opens the film with a narration and his soft, rich voice gently lulls us into pure escapism bliss.  When a star falls into a magical world on Earth, three parties of people set out on quests for it, all with different agendas. The first is young Tristan who is seeking the star as a gift for the snobbish, popular town girl's (Sienna Miller) hand in marriage. The second party is three princes all competing for kingship, which will be given to whoever retrieves the star first. The third and last party is three witches who want the star to return their youthful beauty.      The scenes flow well and the script is sharp, witty, and filled with great one-liners and scenes that will be remembered long after.   The casting, which included cameos by Peter O'Toole and Ricky Gervais, was great and all the actors did a superb job. Michelle Pfeiffer plays her role of the main evil witch with a relish, Robert De Niro's role as the flying pirate captain...well let's just say it is a performance that will be talked about long afterwards, Claire Danes plays the feisty star on Earth with her usual grace, and newcomer Charlie Cox plays the lead, Tristan, holding himself well amongst the other big-names.      Having been filmed in Scotland and Iceland, the scenery was breathtaking and magnificently complimented by the cinematography. The special effects and CGI was used to create just the perfect amount for a fantasy, not detracting from the film, but simply there to enhance the storytelling like all effects should do.      My only miniscule complaint was the music. It was a mediocre score that felt more like filler music than actual music made for the film. It is a small complaint, and one that thankfully does not ruin the film.      Overall an immensely entertaining film that is complete utter fun!
B0009RJVI6|5.0|\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\", the 2005 Orange Award Winner, is by far the best book this reviewer has ever read.  Lionel Shriver, the author, hits her stride after the first chapter, going on to craft a brilliant novel that tackles the nature versus nurture debate in a fresh way.    Told from the point of view of the mother, Shriver takes a new approach to a story we've heard before.  A parent, while usually blamed, is the most sympathetic character in the book.   And the heavy blows are continuous.  The school shooting, while a violent and disturbing, is not the most terrifying issue in the book--that one may be born evil is perhaps more harrowing.  The mother wonders in letters to her husband if it is possible that Kevin was evil from birth.    Shriver explores the Kevin's nature in depth, constructing a fast-paced, heart-breaking novel that is impossible to put down.  I have recommended this book to all of my friends--even ones disinterested in the topic-- and all have loved it.  It is a thriller with a brain and a heart.  Enjoy.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|As the opening scene of American Gangster, has Denzel Washington pumping five bullets into the head of man his men have already soaked with gasoline and set on fire, we quickly realize this is not going to be a sugar-coated gangster film, but an edgy, dark, starkly real portrayal of a brutally ruthless yet frustratingly appealing real life drug lord.      The film is about the real life black drug-lord, Frank Lucas (played by Denzel Washington), who on his own completely revolutionized the heroin industry; and the honest, flawed narcotics detective, Richie Roberts (played by Russell Crowe), who relentlessly pursues him.      Even with Frank being the main character, both characters are given equal screen time. Their lives are methodically developed, and seamlessly interwoven as they build with a subtle inevitability, towards the dramatic conclusion.      Denzel Washington gives a powerful, commanding performance, probably one of the best of his already decorated and memorable career. Russell Crowe once again masters an American accent with stunning ease and perfection, delivering a strong performance.Ridley Scott directs the material with his masterful talent, and edits it into Oscar-contender material, raising it from its genre into that of classics.      I wish more time was given for the two leads to be together, and someone looking to see the movie solely for the sake of watch the two leads together, be warned because there is only one real scene in which they exchange dialogue. This however did not detract from the film which never has a single slow or worthless moment; and is so overwhelmingly powerful, moving, and epic it commands and holds your attention unwavering for its' two-hour-and-forty-minutes.
B000N6TX22|5.0|I saw this the first time after good critical reviews.  I thought it was a good movie the first time but not one of the best I have ever seen.  Then about 3 months went by and I somehow wanted to watch it again.  Some of my favorite movies are ones I dismissed as fine at first.  I bought the HD DVD of it and watched it a second time and just realized how GOOD this film really is.  Clive Owen plays a perfect \\"every day hero\\" and Michael Caine turns in a funny yet heart warming, hippy performance.     Alfonso Cuaron's directing, vision and non-cut editing style make this film a beautiful winner (not to mention the amazing non-stop scene where Clive Owen goes through the building in the end of the movie).  The film's look is fantastic on HD.  The cinematography, editing, art direction and music all blend well and are top notch.  Just a fantastic film that won't totally let you go after watching it.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Jason Bourne has returned to the big screen for the ending of the successful Bourne Trilogy...or is it the end...maybe I shouldn't use the word `trilogy'. It is the so-called end and the filmmakers bring a large measure of closure to everything, but still leaving it open for a sequel. I mean who are we kidding, this is Hollywood.      Anyway...The Bourne Ultimatum is one of the best action thrillers to come out in years. It does not disappoint and maintains the level of originality the other two. Director Paul Greengrass (United 93, Bourne Supremacy) assembles the film with a masterful craftsmanship, and builds the chase/action scenes with an almost Hitchcockian suspense. He effectively uses his signature \\"shaky camera\\" shots, but only to portray the utter chaos the characters are going through.       The story follows Bourne on a quest for answers that spans the globe, starting in Russia and ending in New York. Matt Damon plays Bourne again, terrifyingly calm as always, but this time a little more hardened from the death of his girlfriend in the second film.      The supporting cast all do superb jobs, especially Julia Stiles who has a bigger role. Veteran actor Albert Finney joins the cast and despite his small amount of screen time makes a big impression as the lead doctor of the Treadstone program. Joan Allen is wonderful again as Pamela Landey the operations director from the second one.      John Powell produces another wonderful score containing traces of the main themes. It compliments the suspense building scenes so well I can not imagine what it would be like without it.      Overall an amazingly crafted thriller, and seriously one of the best in years...yes years. My only complaint was that I wished towards the end when you find out all the answers of Jason's past through flashbacks, I wanted to see more about his past. But it is a small complaint compared with the rest of the film. It ends the, okay I am going to use it, Trilogy very well and left me quite satisfied.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|From the moment this charming, funny and winning movie started, I couldn't help but like it.  As a fairy tale it was enchanting and clever and had some really stellar (no pun intended) characters.  It reminded me a great deal of The Princess Bride in that it was a classic love story turned on its head a bit by an interesting and unusual setting and a cast of very vivid and off-the-wall characters.    Tristan is a very likable young man.  He starts off rather goofy and in the end still retains his somewhat nerdy charm.  He's a fresh-faced boy who has big dreams that don't even come close to touching his reality.  He's nice and kind and the kind of person who is easy to cheer on because the viewer really wants him to succeed.  Charlie Cox is a promising young actor who did a wonderful job with the role and this movie will hopefully lead to big things for him.    Though I am normally not much of a Claire Danes fan, she really did a good job with Yvaine.  The character wasn't your typical damsel in distress and she had some very funny comebacks for Tristan.  The character evolves nicely throughout the movie and is a smart, spirited woman with a mind of her own.  No wilting flowers here.    One of the biggest treats of the movie was Michelle Pfeiffer's turn as Lamia.  I think part of what made me want to see the movie was the shot of her vamping it up in her youthful skin that I saw in the preview.  She is by turns rather hideous and radiantly lovely and she does a great job playing an evil witch.  She is sinister and yet comical and it seems like she must have had a lot of fun with the role.    Perhaps the most fun performance, though, is that of Robert De Niro as Captain Shakespeare, who must be the most unconventional pirate ever to exist.  He is simply hilarious as man who has a reputation to uphold even if it means posing as someone who is quite different from his actual nature.      There were many tertiary characters who were funny and original, from the schemingprinces and their machinations to win the throne of Stormhold to the guardian who possesses surprising powers when it comes to keeping the English denizens of Wall from crossing The Wall.      The special effects are well done and imaginative.  It's especially fun to watch Lamia's transformation from decrepitude to youth and back again.  Yvaine's radiance is also nicely done and the pirate ship is visually stunning and innovative.  All in all, this is top notch entertainment.
0345457692|4.0|I had to take away one star from a story that should have been five.  The sci-fi part was awesome! The action and ideas are second to none and kept me reading. It's been a while since I picked up a book that was difficult to put down...then.    I have a teenage daughter and pre-teen son who both like reading my books but because a couple sex scenes are thrown in, for no real reason, I will be taking this book to a used book sale so my children won't see it. Really, I don't have an issue with someone trying to write a steamy story but it was hardly provocative and it did nothing for the story but make me skip over paragraphs.    The story would have stood on it's own and would have been a five. I'm sure the ones who get magazines to read sordid affairs will like those two stories, but it wasn't as good as the author thought.    I hope the only 'hardcore' in the next book (I'll give Morgan one more shot) is just some good 'ol hardcore sci-fi.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|This is the best album I've heard in a while.  I picked this one up upon the recommendation of a friend, having never heard anything of this band previously; since then I've been listening to Boxer straight though at least once every day.  I simply cannot get these songs out of my head--especially \\"Fake Empire\\" and \\"Mistaken for Strangers.\\"  There honestly isn't one throwaway track on this album.  With Amazon's low low price, you really have nothing to lose, so please, stop reading and buy this CD!

B00005JPD0|3.0|This film asks some fantastic nonlinear questions of human capabilities and comprehension regarding our relationship to timespace; however, since it's a Hollywood rendering of speculative fiction it answers them with densely linear logic.  Doug Carlin (Denzel) is charged with unraveling a terrorist act against civilians in New Orleans, and in the midst of doing so stumbles into governmental technology that allows him to venture into the past.  Throwing in quite a few quantum physics buzz words to seemingly seal the logic behind the mysterious technology or either confuse the clueless, the writers were accurate in relaying the current theories and scientific conjecture.  Other films (Minority Report) have perhaps done the metatechno better than this one, but I still thought it stood up well.  However, there were gaping holes in the fictionalized aspects of the technology, that really only served to further confuse what would otherwise have been a really cool premise.  Given the twist of timing, transitions between the present and past were well edited and moved the flow along nicely.<br /><br />I really didn't want to see this film slide into a romance, as it was clear that Carlin was falling for the damsel.  Luckily it made only passing acknowledgment of attraction, which was so slight that it was in perfect character.  Blending scifi and action genres worked well for this content, though.  Along that line, Denzel is a gifted actor, and he does really well in this film.  It's no stretch for him to play a vigilante racing against time to forestall some twisted fate.  This character could have been any one of about four roles he's done already.  Paula Patton (damsel)  is absolutely gorgeous and did well in this role.  James Caviezel was mesmerizing, as a bad guy should be, and he really stood out in terms of how he brought the role to life.  Considering his performance I also have to accept that the one character who seemed to have a metaphysical understanding of timespace was also crazy.  Val Kilmer's character was either under represented in this film or unnecessary, and as such I'm not even sure of the purpose of his character.  His presence did not move the plot forward in any way that another of the more meaningful cast (Adam Goldberg) couldn't have accomplished.<br /><br />In short,  no ground be broken here.  It's an interesting film,  well acted, well directed.  Just don't look to it for anything more than that.was also crazy.

B0000025JT|5.0|I have anxiously been waiting to get this Cd.  Barbara and Barry created sensational duets with this one.  I remember growing up as a young girl and listening to the Guilty album.  Thank you for having this item in stock.  It brings back wonderful memories and I think everyone should buy this cd either as a gift or for  yourself.  Each song has a special message for anyone in love or looking for love.  lol
B000ZLFALI|4.0|I found the '07 release `Across the Universe' to be a nostalgic, enjoyable film that beautifully highlights the songs of the greatest rock/pop group of the twentieth century and beyond. The cast is thoroughly likeable, the cameos excellent, especially Bono and Joe Cocker, and the storyline and visuals pure `60's.<br /><br />There are numerous levels of thought and genres from which one can approach this film. It's a musical, a period piece, a cultural/political statement, a love story and a poignant coming of age tale. Remarkably it succeeds on all levels. Put on your walrus outfit and give it a try.<br /><br />My Rating: -4 ½ Stars-.
037571457X|5.0|First, I want to point out that despite the ostensibly grim subject matter the author's sense of humor, at times insouciant and deliciously irreverent, shines through. This is not a book that will depress you. It educates while involving you intimately with the life of Marjane Satrapi and her entire family.    A second note: too many intellectual blowhards dismiss the graphic novel genre as \\"comics for kids.\\" Yet ever since Art Spiegelman's Maus, we've seen the rise of a richly developed class of historical graphic novels. These works provide the same level of edification and sophistication as any good historical nonfiction book. It's like reading a diary with pictures. The format doesn't detract from the story. It enhances it.     At its most basic, Persepolis is the touching experience of a young girl growing up in Iran during the reign of the Shah and the turbulent aftermath of revolution and Islamic repression. This biography in graphic form is helpful for non-Iranians, and I daresay Americans in particular. I think many Americans (myself included) have a tendency to see their country as the beacon of democracy. Americans tend to act as though we are the only ones who have struggled so valiantly to achieve democratic equality. In contrast, Americans look at other countries struggling towards (but so far failing to achieve) these ideals as backward and superstitious. Persepolis shows a more nuanced reality. Instead of just viewing Iran as a dangerous and backward Islamic country, this memoir illustrates the country's historic battles for freedom and equality. Against the backdrop of imperialism and capitalism without a political voice, we see how Iran has evolved into what it is today. In other words, Persepolis reveals how Iran's current problems stem from more complex roots than simple \\"Islamofascism\\".     A final note - please, please, whatever you do, read the book before seeing the film. The book is far superior at developing the characters so you truly careabout them. The film smashes both Persepolis I and II together, abbreviating events in such a way that poignant and fascinating encounters are lost.

1600241344|5.0|David Baldacci's SPLIT SECOND is an excellent thriller pairing a fine reading by Scott Brick with a moving thriller revolving around one Michelle, who has blown her future with the Secret Service and when she lets her charge vanish. She joins forces with the unlikely Sean King who has a similar problem - and the two delve into a world of secrets and deadly coincidences. Both are high-powered thrillers.
B000Y9Q59W|4.0|Upon the moment of arrival I popped it into the Blu-ray player, eager to see how the transfer to HD faired. All in all, a decent transfer. The audio could have been remastered in some parts where it's clear there were some audio issues in the original (uneven volume, out of sync with actors...both those were in the original film though). The open and closing credits look like they were shot with a dirty camera lens, barely conveying the idea it *might* have been an \\"artistic choice\\", but the rest of the film looks pretty good. The film grain is definitely visible, but not to the point where it's intrusive or gives the impression it was a bad transfer.<br /><br />The movie is a great one and the extras are a great addition to this HD upgrade. A documentary talks about the making of the film (and the inter-personal conflicts between the actors...Daryl Hannah was very unhappy with her role and Sean Young clashed with Charlie Sheen so much they had to be separated). Oliver Stone's commentary is insightful and there are little gems all throughput the film.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|In the fall of 2006, I first saw the Lord of the Rings series. After some time, I was hooked. What really caught a lot of my attention was the music. The more and more I learned about the thought put into this trilogy, and the more and more I saw them showed me just how great this project was and is. Return of the King: The Complete Recordings will blow you away. With absolutely moving performances from Renee Fleming, James Galway, Sissel, Ben del Maestro, Viggo Mortensen, and others, this box set is awesome. A lot of my favorite tracks are on the third and fourth CDs, but the first and second have favorites as well. \\"The Grace of Undomiel,\\" \\"The Lighting of the Beacons,\\" and \\"Anduril  Flame of the West\\" (from CDs 1 and 2)are great. Yet, for all out fans who have analyzed and studied the movies there are little tidbits that make this AWESOME. A few examples would be the little viola (?) bit at the very end of \\"The Sacrifice of Faramir\\" which has a little Middle Eastern sound to it [I think anyway :-)] and the choral seconds accompanying Eomer's discovery of Eowyn after Pelennor Fields.       Choral! Choral! Choral! So many choral and vocal bits certainly capture me. If you're new to choral music, this might be a good starter to get you into it. Caution though: it get's rather intense near the end :-) (I'm loving it though). Ah...words can't describe the emotion portrayed by Howard Shore throughout this music. This is definitely some of my favorite music in the world. If the price is steep for you (it was for me) try talking to your family or friends about helping you out (especially if they are LOTR fans or even just music lovers). Then when you get it you can share this masterpiece with them!    P.S.   (If you DO get it, blast \\"For Frodo\\" for me!)

0143039830|5.0|This is a series of subtle interlocking novellas set in New York published over 85 and 86: City of Glass, \\"Ghosts\\" and \\"Locked Room with the first set in the period, the 2nd in the 40's and the last one in the 70's. They use mystery conventions of the gumshoe detective (think Humphrey Bogart)  but in a subversive way as an existentialist reflection on writing, and story creation and communication but at the pace of a thriller; it more Kafka then Chandler with haunting imagery and surreal coincidences.  But it also has deep emotional and psychological depths.<br /><br />To give you a flavour of the book, in the City of Glass the main Character is Daniel Quinn a writer who has abandoned writing except for mystery writing owing to the death of his wife and child. He is successful enough to only need to write one novel a year which he has just done and then he drifts. He is clearly depressed and only feels alive when he is the private eye of his novels. One night he receives a midnight phone call asking for a  detective  called Paul Auster( yes the real author is also a later character in the story) and after several rejections he decides to act as if were his private eye character. His clients are a child-man who is a survivor of a dreadful abuse by his father (he was deprived of language as part of an experiment in discovering the natural language of man before the fall of the Tower of Babel) and his wife a nurse who had married him so that he could leave the hospital. The father now elderly is being released from Mental hospital and they fear that the son will be killed and want protection.<br /><br />The story then takes many twists and turns and ends with the author as character being criticised by a final narrator who may be one of the characters from the other stories for what happens to Daniel Quinn during the course of the story.<br /><br />In the Locked Room all the characters are named after colours and it's a classical stake-out story but is it?  Or is it a reflection on the lives of characters once that have been created and written about?<br /><br />The final story is of two friends who have drifted apart, one wanted to be a writer and is now a critic unable to create works of his own imagination. He discovers that his friend has disappeared leaving a wife and baby and a locked room of manuscripts. These turn out to be masterpieces of novels, plays, and poems far beyond his capability of writing. In preparing those for publishing he re-enters and re-evaluates his life long friendship and what it meant but at a cost as he faces a secret that tests him and his relationships to destruction.<br /><br />Paul Auster's draws on his own colourful work life in his struggle to become a writer so the stories have a grain of gritty realism.  But they are interlinked by an interest in the impact of coincidences and lives lived in minimalist even ascetic ways against a background of a loss, failure and absent fathers and reflections on writing and storytelling. If you want a painless way into postmodernist metafiction then this is the book for you. Highly recommendeds of characters once that have been created and written about?

B00009L1UP|4.0|From a sales perspective \\"Empire\\" would be the band's biggest seller.  Coming off the artistic and commercial success of \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" Queensryche were on a roll and \\"Empire\\" proved just the ticket.  Personally I think it is a minor step down from \\"Mindcrime\\" as there are a few filler tracks to be found here, but overall it is a very good Queensryche album.  The band scored an unlikely hit with it's Pink Floyd like \\"Silent Lucidity\\" ballad.  This track is about as far from metal as you can get and once again displayed Queensryche's unique versatility.  \\"Jet City Woman\\" and \\"Another Rainy Night\\" were also big hits, both decent songs but definitely cut in a more commercial mode.  In addition to the hits there are several excellent album cuts to be found.  The opening track \\"Best I Can\\", the almost jazzy \\"Della Brown, the politically charged title track \\"Empire\\", and the finale \\"Anybody Listening\\" all outstanding definitive Queensryche.  The rest of the album is all ok, but leans in an unfortunate direction that the band would move down in the future.  \\"Empire\\" was the band's commercial peak and the tour they did to support it was a full mega production that was an awesome spectacle to behold.  This is not the band's best album, but it is certainly worth owning.
0743455967|4.0|I have never read a Stephen King novel.  I am not a fan of Horror, Fantasy or whatever.  Having read this book, I think I'll try either Misery, The Green Mile or Dolores Claybourne.   The book takes a craftsman's view of writing, does not overdo the theory and yet gives some space to theme and imagery.  He is engaging in describing how his writing is influenced by his reading, and that a serious writer must spend a significant amount of time reading.  There is a hugely credible piece about when to write alone and when to ask for someone else's opinion.   That said the first and last sections of the book are a bit odd, the first piece is a description of the author's early life and describes some of his motivations in becoming a writer. OK, I suppose.  The last bit is about a serious traffic accident which he suffered midway through writing the book.  I found this unnecessary, though his descriptive skill made me empathize with his fear, frustration and anger, I felt he used his fame to attack the, now deceased, driver whose carelessness caused the accident.  Structural quirks aside, I found the book enormously enjoyable and encouraging.

B000VDDWE2|4.0|All I have to say is that I loved this movie.  Did I believe any of it, no, but there's the problem with the negative reviews... people don't know a popcorn movie even if it hit them right in the face.  Anyhow, I love popcorn movies.  Movies like this is what keeps me going to the movies.  Money well spent.
1416550518|4.0|Kate Morton shows her love for the traditional Gothic novel in this story of an old woman finally revealing her secrets. Grace Bradley has never told anyone what happened on the night that the poet Robbie Hunter died. She was a lady's maid serving Hannah Hartford when she witnessed the event. Now, in tape recorded conversations for her grandson Marcus, Grace finally reveals the truths of her life - the events of that night, and the secrets of her lifetime.    Morton writes beautifully, and builds the tension of the novel slowly as she reveals each mystery. It took a while to get into the pace of the story, but by page 150 I was hooked. I hope to read more by this author!
B000ZLFALS|5.0|Geez! I was amazed to see plenty of pre-reviews of this title on Amazon website. Today is the release date of both DVD & Blu-ray of this film (February 5, 2008) so I will take the opportunity to review what I have just seen with my eyes without any fantasies and/or imagination.    The movie: This is a \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" film. Personally I love it. There is plenty of subtleties and depth in the dialogue that only hard core Beatles fans would understand. Visually, it is very imaginative and one of the best musicals I have seen in recent years.    The Picture: This is a reference quality Blu-ray disc, very crisp and clean transfer with solid, deep, bold colours and natural film-like quality. In fact, it is among the very best video I have seen in Blu-ray format. The film is presented in its original anamorphic 2.40:1 aspect ratio.    Audio: Two thumbs up.  It is a good disc to give your audio system a good workout.    Peace to all and enjoy the movie.
B00104W8T6|5.0|If you liked the movie, you'll love bringing it's tunes into your home.  The soundtrack is full of light-hearted, upbeat songs that make you giggle, smile and eventually sing along.
B000LI4DX6|5.0|There is no sex, minor violence, no blood and how to be weird and survive. THese nobods in school have feelings, homes and hassles as the pretty things stroll through life. Trisha's mom was right, y'know! I wished I could have seen this when I was like 10, or 13, or even 23. I could have done whatever I felt like doing, GOSH!
B000000OUW|5.0|This is another band, like AC/DC where you know what you are getting when you buy it. There is no mistaking their sound or style. Along with the metal anthems are a few classical interludes thrown in. Very macho and very metal. Yeah, it may seem a little excessive, but you can't knock a group of guys that really believe in what they are doing. And, it is very entertaining. I give it five stars because I got what I paid for. It rocks and I highly recommend it.
159102594X|3.0|An interesting if heavily flawed book, I found myself in the middle almost giving it up and by the end feeling satisfied, like having watched a good popcorn movie.     Abercrombie fills the book with interesting but clichéd characters (except for the cripple Glokta--one of the most interesting characters I've come across in a fantasy novel). In fact, the book suffers from too many characters, too many events and locations. For the most part, we never see any real motives from anyone of importance; everyone just feels along for the ride.    And here we come to the greatest flaw: the ride itself, or plot rather. It is disjointed and unfocused. The end of the book could have occurred at any other point. I felt no real story arch, and certainly came away confused at what the second book would even be about--and more importantly, \\"why\\". Certainly the fight scenes are brutal and bloody and quite enjoyable, put the story itself felt lacking.    So I give the book 3 stars and believe it to be worth the read, especially if the Conan stories are up your alley. I will also buy the second book in the series and hope that it is less confusing and more focused, now that most of the characters appear to be in play. I feel that this book could have been better, but it's good enough for a light read, and certainly enjoyable enough.
B00068TJM6|2.0|I bought this watch for my bf as a valentines day gift. Just received it today. Through amazon I read many good reviews for this watch and the picture shown on here is amazing looking. When I opened the box I saw that the case for this watch is incredibly cheap looking - and worse, this ones broken!! The presentation is just awful. I know two or three hundred dollars is not too expensive but it definitely deserves more than this. The watch itself can't compare to the picture display on here. Very dissapointed... I'll give it to my bf and let him decide whether we should return it.
1932100660|2.0|I was initially swayed by the book, but after two years of being a vegetarian, I didn't lose any weight or feel much better. What Campbell is missing from this vegan diatribe is the fact that grass-fed meat and other healthier (hormone and antibiotic-free, free-range, etc.) animal products are very good for you. In fact, there are quite a few anthropological studies (Inuit Eskimos in Alaska, Masai in Kenya) which support this. To date, I know of no actual studies of indigenous vegan populations. What's also ironic about this book is how little of the China Study itself is mentioned here.     Also, Campbell makes a lot of poor judgments on low-carb diets, which are continually bashed by him, Ornish and other supporters of the low-fat vegetarian lifestyle. One very recent study at Stanford confirmed that the Atkins Diet not only resulted in the most weight loss, but also healthy blood lipid profiles as well. [...] We need fats (Trans fats, however, need to be avoided at all costs!), including saturated fat, in our diets for many health reasons, including vitamin absorption. Campbell's low-fat dogma is not only unrealistic, it's unhealthy! Vegan diets, especially those high in soy, are also bound to cause serious vitamin deficiencies in the long-term. I know that's what I experienced.      My solution: eat organic foods of all kinds whenever possible; avoid processed foods, refined sugars and carbohydrates, artificial ingredients and trans fats; and base your personal nutrition on facts, not ideology.
B000ZK4466|5.0|Wow.  The recording, the production, the new drummer... I'm near speechless.  I know that most people have a boner for De-loused, and it's a great album, but each successive release from this band nearly reinvents music altogether.  This album has to be one of, if not the most impressive and cohesive works I've ever heard.      There is so much going on in each song.  They are all so full, and you'll be checking out Pridgen's (sp?) drumming for awhile with your brain melting and mouth wide open and all of a sudden you realize that some guitar solo has been slapping you in the face for about 20 seconds and you didn't even know it.   I described to a friend while hearing this album for the first time, that I imagined myself laying down, in outer space with each instrument representing a different spirit, and each one is taking advantage of my body in horrible ways.  I don't think that many people could do ANYTHING in life at this level.      Listen to it.  Love it.  Be blown away.  This is music reinvented.
B000002KOO|5.0|Most of what's been said about this LP on CD is spot on.  This LP represents the only hard rock edition of Fleetwood Mac (the previous LP's were as a blues band and the subsequent are pop).    This LP was issued in the UK with additional tracks - that had already appeared on the previous Epic LP \\"English Rose\\" and therefore US Reprise did not have the rights to include them here.    The US LP was originally issued without \\"Oh Well\\".  Within a year, Reprise reworked the LP and added \\"Oh Well\\" and moved around the remaining tracks.    As regards \\"Oh Well\\", they simply includes both sides of the mono single.  It has never been mixed into stereo and the ending of Part 1 is the same as the beginning of Part 2, so there's a section that's repeated.    Reprise should remaster the LP, restoring the original UK playing order, get rid of the hiss and produce a new STEREO mix of \\"Oh Well\\" as the last song, properly combining the songs into one continuous, seamless track without the repeated section.    Apparently, someone in the Fleetwood Mac office is stopping this from happening.

1577314808|5.0|[[ASIN:1595072160 The Angel Hunter]]<br /><br />Any critics of Eckhart's teachings are not wrong, but neither are they right. Acceptance of what Eckhart teaches- as fact or practical-leaves the reader in a mental state of analysis. This is NOT the now of which he speaks. When the gaps in the stream of thought are found, any rational or physical explanation is impossible. This is because that state of wakefulness is beyond the limits of the human mind. And for those of us who have stepped into it and tasted in our souls that complete resonance of the cosmos, which is eternal and unborn, you know of what I'm writing.<br />For critics of Eckhart who state the ego is an essential part of our existence, I recommend The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. A literary documentary on just how far the ego, in its insatiable hunger for identity and power, will go.
B000Y179KO|3.0|This release is good.  There are flaws for me though.  After all the years of listening to the solo releases, this group of songs more closely resembles the solo work from Frey, Henley and Walsh.  The song \\"How Long\\" does sound like the Eagles and is is perfectly placed on the CD in the #2 spot after the Eaglesque opening harmony.  \\"How Long\\" has the energy and singing from the early Eagles sound.  No wonder.  The song was written back in the 70's.  Then there's the Timothy Schimdt songs.  They're classic!   Overall, this package of songs are good.  Hey, it's the Eagles!!  If you're a fan, buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
B000006OAM|5.0|I have been a Natalie fan since the 10,000 Maniacs first self-produced releases.  I talked to her early on at local shows and continued to follow her progress, the band's, and guitarist John Lombardo's.  Having heard everything by the Maniacs, and Miss Merchant, it's my opinion that her solo masterpiece is \\"Ophelia\\".<br /><br />If you're new to Natalie Merchant, her first solo CD, \\"Tigerlily\\", is wonderful.  I'm sure she felt she had something to prove after leaving the Maniacs and she makes a very strong case that she was meant to go solo.  The album is strong, catchy, and upbeat.  \\"Ophelia\\" was her second solo CD and it is, by contrast, much more somber than \\"Tigerlily\\".  I'd think the dark sound of the CD probably made it less enjoyable than \\"Tigerlily\\" to those people who view her as a light pop artist. I, however, find the CD much more rewarding to return to than \\"Tigerlily\\".  Her third solo CD was \\"Motherland\\".  That's a CD that even I, unfortunately, view as too downbeat and without enough catchy melodies.<br /><br />\\"Ophelia\\" is probably her richest sounding solo CD.  Where \\"Tigerlily\\" was poppy, and \\"Motherland\\" was willfully folky, \\"Ophelia\\" uses classical instruments to expand the sound.  The CD contains three songs that were singles: \\"Life is Sweet\\", \\"Kind and Generous\\", and \\"Break Your Heart\\", so it has more than its share of good hummable singles.  What helps makes this CD better than the others though is that it feels as if all the songs are part of a greater whole.  Another positive attribute is that the lead singer from the band The Innocence Mission sings harmony on two of these tracks, and she has a haunting voice.<br /><br />If you want to check out Miss Merchant at her heaviest most successful solo moment, this CD is the one.<br /><br />P.S.: Director Frank Stamm, and friend of mine, did interviews with the 10,000 Maniacs in 2013 and put together a video profile of the band. The profile is available on Youtube under the heading \\"FS profile/interview of 10,000 MANIACS\\".view of 10,000 MANIACS\\".
B00005NB0H|5.0|Years from now, when people begin to realize that rock music is dead as a viable art from, just like big bands died after the 50's and the remaining acts have essentially become nostalgia acts, this recording will be recognized for what it is - a seminal recording of one of the all time great rock bands ever.<br /><br />Live at Leeds - recorded in 1970 - suffered from a few limitations at the time of release.  One, it was limited to a single record because in 1970 there was the LP.  Two, recordings were on tape and no technology existed to clean defects as exists today.  Those limitations are no longer in the cards - fortunately!<br /><br />I was happy to see this recording re-released in 2001.  The two CD's commemorate the greatness of this band. The first CD has many hits, played well, including a searing and snarling \\"Substitute,\\" a wistful \\"Happy Jack\\" and a great rendition of \\"Summertime Blues\\".  The best track in my mind is probably a toss-up between \\"Magic Bus\\" and a 15 minute plus \\"My Generation\\" which recalls the energy of The Who in full transcendence at Woodstock (the best performance of that show to my mind).<br /><br />The second CD is full of a long performance of \\"Tommy\\" a great reach by The Who to transcend the limitation of pop songs in a three minute format.  They certainly pushed the envelope of music and predated in some way what would become the progressive rock era - but played with that punk/mod attitude that still sounds fresh and vital.  These guys ROCK!<br /><br />The sound is awesome and full of the fury of The Who.  They really are the forerunners of punk music which overtook England in the later 1970's.<br />Honestly, you can truly hear the power of Townshend's guitar in these recordings.  The performances of each of the band members is more clearly heard in this release then the original.  You can hear the banter between the band and some in the crowd - never before heard in the original.<br />The sound is truly magnificent, and the music sounds as vital now as in 1970.  Moon can be heard clowning in the midst of his still awesome drumming.  And there is the late Entwistle somehow keeping time in the midst of the sublime chaos.<br /><br />Quibbles?  A few exist.  The only real significant quibble for me is the mix takes away Daltrey's fury in \\"Young Man Blues\\" where he delivers what I thought was the underlying statement of the whole song, \\" He ain't got nothing in the world these days, he ain't got nothin, he ain't got ^&%@, ^&*( off!.  That captured and blew my mind in my early 20's and still does, but it is somehow muddled. Oh well.<br /><br />This is a great recording of one of the greatest rock bands in history.

B000VKJ6VS|4.0|I take back what I said before about this album. At first listen, I found it boring. However, after playing it a few more times, I started to understand what these guys were doing and I must say, they made a great album. It's not quite as good as \\"One Day Remains\\", but darn close and definitely worth owning.

Sophie, who works across the street, senses something suspicious after watching the strange man.<br /><br />After a magical fight that involves both siblings, they discover Josh's boss isn't exactly who he's claiming to be.<br /><br />He is in fact the famous Nicolas Flamel, whose tomb lies empty.  He and his wife have been on the run to escape Dr. Dee's clutches and hide a magical book, which holds more secrets than anyone imagines.

Since the twins have already been exposed, he allows them to accompany him as he sets forth to recover both Perry and the book.<br /><br />Michael Scott pens the first novel in a new series with action-packed adventure and fantasy.  Harry Potter fans will, of course, recognize the name Nicholas Flamel, but that's where the similarities between the two stories end.  THE ALCHEMYST delivers a fresh spin on magic that is sure to please.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Jennifer Rummel
B000ETQPYM|4.0|This was pretty good chic lit.  I thought the author did a really good job telling this story.  Holly is a young widow, trying to get over the loss of her husband.  About five months after he dies, Holly receives a package of letters written by Gerry  before his death. She is to open one each month until the end of the year.  The letters help her slowly get on with her life and yet keep a small part of Gerry alive.  I liked the idea of this story.  The main characters are very well developed.  I wish I had a family like Holly's.  The ending is definitely a surpise.  I did not expect it.  If definitely is not a Hollywood ending.  I wonder if the movie is?
B000JSI7DK|2.0|How could they NOT include extras or an extra disc in a $30 Blu Ray release?<br /><br />There's a 30 minute interview with Stallone on the DVD version that is one of the best extras I've ever seen included in a film. Why they would leave that out is beyond me.<br /><br />Listen up, studio execs - give the customer what he expects, especially for an item priced at a premium.
0307387151|2.0|This book put me to sleep.  I like the plot, but the book was too wordy.  I did not like the way everything is overly described.  I am an avid reader and have a very vivid imagination; I do not need all those unnecessary sentences to get me hooked on the book.  I found myself skipping full paragraphs to avoid all the unnecessary details and get to the good stuff.  After reading like this, for half the book I finally gave up and put the book down for good.  I am looking forward to going to the theater and watching the film, hopefully it doesn't make me sleepy too

I hate it that it isn't on DVD and I don't understand why it isn't.  I would pay over $[...] for a DVD that was well done and legal from America.  I wish it would get put on DVD like all the other classics. I miss Yentl all the time!
B00138F080|1.0|A friend introduced me to this band with the single, Electric Feel. And I fell IN LOVE. So I listened to a few snipets and thought, sure, this could be good and it's only $5.49 so why not. Yeah, I want my $6 back.     Someone said the album was great cause it was creative. That doesn't mean the songs are particularly good or melodic, and they're not. With the exception of the single, it's actually painful to listen to and now I need some Advil.     Not a happy exchange with Amazon. So sad.

B00005Y1TL|4.0|Could Richard D. James ever predicted, way back in 1985, what people would be cherishing these years later?  It's nearly 2008, but this album sounds like it could come from the year 2020 and still sound good.  Ambient music may be one of the most calm music out there, with a lot of soul that fans always wonder why so many people give such a fuss about disney music.  It's hard to believe music like this comes from electronics.<br /><br />Okay, it may be a bit cliched, but for those of you who were introduced and know Aphex Twin by the Come To Daddy song (which was an accidental hit according to Richard, he didn't really like it), prepare to be surprised.  Indeed, there's no hint of creepiness or fear in this album, it's light and fear free.  It's still an ambient album at heart, but it's got one of a kind melodies and some cool rhythms.  Aphex Twin was making his own kind of music sense the beggining.  And thankfully, there's some great music on here!<br /><br />There truly isn't a bad song on this album, although it's a bit long and demands you to be in the right mood to be able to sit through it.  There's not much else to say to any electronic music fans out there.  Get Selected Ambient Works, or at least check it out.  You won't be dissapointed.  If you don't like, at least you say you tried.  You can't be an electronic fan and ignore music like this.<br /><br />8.5/10<br /><br />Update: This album is being remastered and rereleased, if you haven't seen it on amazon yet.

B000ASDFJU|5.0|Sex and the City is by far the best television show ever made. Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Catrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis are the perfect group of girlfriends, and the show would not be the same without any one of them. I've been watching this show for years, and can STILL watch it over and over. I am just as addicted now as I was in the beginning! This show has it all - wit, humor, sexiness, tears... and each episode is completely relateable!     This Complete Series Collector's Giftset is awesome! Not only is it great looking, but it beats the original individual packaging by far! I'm not sure why those were packaged the way they were, but they fall apart. Even I, keeping everything I own in prestine condition, could not keep them from breaking at each fold. That really disappointed me, but now there's a great solution! I would recommend this product to anyone who is a fan of the show.

B00005JMAH|5.0|In the 7 book Harry Potter series, PoA remains my favorite book. I have probably read it more than any of the others in the series.     The third movie is not line for line a video copy of the book. There would be no conceivable way to make that a realistic reality.     I was quite pleasantly surprised and delighted at this adaptation. The overall ambiance and storyline was preserved. Yes, many details are lacking, if you go line to line from the book. Take this movie as an entity on itself, and you have a solid, incredibly enjoyable movie.     This is one of very few movies created from published books that I can say is as good or better than the original work. To date, this remains my  favorite HP movie (and yes, I have seen all five released movies).    And I must salute Michael Gambon. To have to step into the robes of Albus Dumbledore, after Richard Harris- wow. He is NOT the same, and I do not believe that he ever planned to play Dumbledore as Harris did- thank goodness. He played him his own way, while still keeping the spirit of Dumbledore intact. Kudos to Gambon!
0894803123|5.0|This is the PERFECT book for anybody who has an ice cream maker.  I'd go so far as to say that it's the only book you need if want to make ice cream at home.  This isn't merely a book on getting the popular Ben & Jerry's flavors you see in the store, but everything else you'll ever need to know about ice cream making.      What's best is that B&J explain all their trials and errors in plain English.  They'll tell you what works and what doesn't, and why.  There's still more than enough room to experiment, but using this book can save you countless hours of quarts-gone-bad.    I bought my first ice cream maker last fall at Sharper Image.  Although the machine came with some sample recipes, I wanted to buy some books for some more in-depth ideas.  Bruce Weinstein's \\"Ultimate Ice Cream Book\\" was huge, but almost too big, and a little strange to navigate through.  But this little Ben & Jerry's book is excellent.      The first chapter on Ben & Jerry's history is a fun read, but it's the second chapter, \\"Ice Cream Theory\\", you'll definitely want to pay attention to before diving into the recipes.  This is an excellent 8 page crash course in ice cream 101.  What exactly makes ice cream the way it is?  How precisely does heavy cream match up with light cream, whole milk, condensed whole milk, or evaporated milk, and what are the different results from using these?  How exactly do sweeteners, eggs, fruit, and salt fit in to the equation?  How do you add the stuff like cookies and nuts, or liquor?      The next section gives you three different recipes for \\"sweet cream\\" bases, before going on to the individual recipes.  Most of the recipes in the book just call for creating one of these sweet cream bases first, then adding whatever else makes the specific flavor you want.  It's set up as one recipie per page.  And the ice cream recipes are further broken down into other categories: chocolate variations, sorbets, using fruits or cookies, etc.    In addition to all of that, the book includes recipes for desserts like brownies and cookies, plus recipes for sauce toppings, fried ice cream, and a number of other strange concoctions.    I guess my only complaint would be that the book is 20 years old and could use some updating, namely some more recipes on other B&J flavors that have come and gone since then.  Then again, maybe it's up for us to explore that.  Oh yeah, and do get yourself a gym membership!  You're going to need it after using this book.
B000GTJT0W|5.0|In the modern age of drugs, sex and foul language, this movie was a breath of fresh air.  Anyone of any age can watch this movie and enjoy it.  It's not a serious storyline, but it is a lot of good clean family fun in the \\"Indiana Jones\\" fashion. I thoroughly enjoyed it, so did my wife, 10 year old daughter and 13 year old son.  The video and audio quality is out standing, one of the best in my collection,  and I just can't understand some of the negative comments made here. This is , not \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", so enjoy it for what it was supposed to be, and what it is, a lot of family fun.    EDIT  I wrote the above review after watching the DVD and have since purchased the HD DVD to increase the video and audio quality for future viewing.   I am however EXTREMLY disappointed with the HD DVD version. There is no visible increase in picture quality and for some reason the audio is poor. The soundtrack on the DVD rattles the windows but this version hardly breaks into a sweat.  I do have an XA2 and the upscaling it does of good quality DVDs is astounding, this maybe why there is no increase in video quality, it doesn't however explain a huge drop off in audio quality. Whenever I fully re watch this movie, I will play the DVD instead.  If you don't have a Toshiba XA2, do yourself a favor and buy one before they are all gone, upscaled DVDs are out of this world played on it!
B0000A1RJI|4.0|If you have listened to any of Hans Zimmer's work, this sounds quite like it.<br />Listen to Barbarian Horde from Gladiator (about the middle of the track on to the end), and then listen to He's a Pirate. Almost identical themes used.<br />I'm not complaining, as there usually isn't too much of a good thing.<br />All in all, a decent soundtrack, something you feel like a pirate with and it makes you want to go out and swashbuckle something...
0452289963|1.0|Oh PUHLEEEZE. If you are a buddhist this book is for you. If you are a Christian, forget it. Here's the problem. Oprah recommended this book. Have you ever seen Oprah ever recommend a book that was worth diddly squat (other than \\"Cry the Beloved Country\\" which was written in the 40s and when Oprah recommended it, it was like she'd just discovered it, sheesh).    There are no 'secrets'... there is 'being a child' and 'growing into an ADULT'. You want answers? READ THE BIBLE. THINK. FORGIVE. STUDY. LEARN. HELP OTHERS. PRACTICE SELF-DISCIPLINE. PRAISE THE LORD.    Get it? Then you don't need this book or any other book by this 'author'. Heaven's sake, people, OPRAH recommended it. That should tell you something. She might be rich, but she is NOT that 'enlightened'. Tiffany bubble blower, who cares.
B000OONQBM|5.0|My Review of the HD DVD Version of The Warriors (Ultimate D.C.)

B0007GAEW6|5.0|For those of you wondering which movement is which in \\"Cassandra Gemini,\\" this is how the CD tracks are divided:       1. \\"Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus\\" - 13:02     2. \\"The Widow\\" - 5:51     3. \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" - 12:22     4. \\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\" - 13:10     5. \\"Cassandra Gemini - A.

Sarcophagi\\" - 0:54    I figured this out by following the lyrics while listening to the album.      I hope the band seriously considers releasing a \\"Director's Cut\\" of this record in the future including the missing opening title track (eventually released on the CD single of \\"The Widow\\") and presenting the album as 6 whole CD tracks like it was originally intended.  Although it would have to be a 2-CD set to accomodate the 90-minute running time (the title track is 15 minutes alone), it will make the album sound more complete.  In the meantime, find yourself a copy of \\"The Widow\\" single, rip the track \\"Frances The Mute\\" onto your computer along with the official 'Frances' CD and arrange the tracklisting as such:    1. \\"Frances The Mute\\"  2. \\"Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus\\"  3. \\"The Widow\\"  4. \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\"  5. \\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\"  6. \\"Cassandra Gemini\\"    Thank goodness for playlists!
B000ZK4466|5.0|On this album The Mars Volta have returned to the violent mood swings and manic aggression of Frances the Mute, after the relatively quiet Amputechture. Everyone here must remember that TMV are very difficult to love, both for beginners and for fans devoted to one or two of the past albums. TMV consistently delivers the most jaw-droppingly intense and challenging music that has ever been anywhere near my brain, but I can understand if others declare this music to be pretentious and preposterous. Negative reviews of TMV often make fairly good points about song structures that are so bizarre that they appear undeveloped, or that the progressive songwriting and instrumentation are too noisy or self-indulgent. (By the way, none of this applies to crybabies who wish that the band still sounded like they did several albums ago, because if TMV didn't constantly change and develop they wouldn't even be TMV in the first place. If you want a band to sound exactly the same for four albums straight, listen to smooth jazz or country pop because you're out of your league here.) With all that being said, The Mars Volta appeals most to listeners with a certain adventurous mindset. If you're on board, the ride keeps getting more and more exciting.<br /><br />In addition to the always fascinating  and fearless songwriting by Omar and Cedric, everyone in the growing band (all nine of them, including John Frusciante) are playing with the utmost passion and precision, with improvisation and sound manipulation as key components of the TMV sound. This goes double for new drummer Thomas Pridgen, who is less nimble than the stupendous Jon Theodore but adds undeniable power and energy to the proceedings. Key tracks here include \\"Goliath\\" which actually approaches standard rock forms before blowing them out of the water, and \\"Cavalettas\\" which some naysayers might find repetitive and disjointed, but which the rest of us would find relentless and unforgiving. One real surprise is the haunting \\"Soothsayer\\" which introduces several genres of world music to the TMV repertoire and utilizes all sorts of exotic instrumentation. \\"Ilyena\\" and \\"Askepios\\" are fascinating showcases of all that TMV has to offer, from the friendly to the scary to the emotional, and \\"Ouroborous\\" features a weird aggro rhythm that may remind some of a trippier System of a Down. The only misstep on this album is the quiet interlude \\"Tourniquet Man\\" which accomplishes little more than resetting the mood after the furious \\"Goliath.\\" But just like with everything else The Mars Volta has ever done, you're advised to jump on this train, lest it run you over before you even begin to appreciate what just hit you.

B000YENUI6|5.0|David Cronenberg is a director NOT to be dismissed. Last year's pairing of him and Viggo Mortensen (A History of Violence) provided one the the most exciting film events of last year. Viggo is so relaxed and subdued that it's hard, at first, to understand his Oscar nomination, though there is a regular undercurrent of renewal and redemption he finds that is so terribly profound (and sad) at the end. This film, based on real persons in the Russian mafia in London, is scripted by the very clever Steve Knight, Oscar nominated for \\"Dirty, Pretty Things\\", but I thought this was better, though very similar. I won't say more about the plot, but the participation of the always wonderful Naomi Watts, and Armin Mueller-Stahl are perfect. I also liked Vincent Cassel a lot; should've been nominated for his very difficult role. Indeed, the casting all-around is letter-perfect. The DVD offers a few insightful extras, especially about the tattoo element, more important than you might think. I enjoyed \\"Eastern Promises\\" as an exciting film achievement. A huge feather in the hat of the very competent David Cronenberg. If Viggo's performance seems too subtle to compare against others that weren't nominated, let's not forget his auspicious debut in Sean Penn's \\"The Indian Runner\\", as well as LOTR and his other pairing with Cronenberg, and many others. The Academy often likes to cover their past mistakes.
B000ZLFALS|2.0|Julie Taymor's \\"Across The Universe\\" is a movie I really wanted to like. I love the Beatles, and movies like Moulin Rouge, but the heavily contrived forging of the Beatles songs into the plot line just feels very heavy handed. Most of the moments where these songs are used or characters are introduced feels just ever so slightly cringe worthy.    The movie doesn't seen to have a clearly defined backbone either. It seems highly schizophrenic in its visual style and story telling, with many sequences just not making any sense at all unlike the masterful flair that was weaved into Moulin Rouge. Moulin Rouge weaves and dances around a narrative vision, Across The Universe seems more like Pac Man, a series of \\"dots\\".    Don't get me wrong the movie has its moments, and some are really compelling and artistic, but overall its the lack of connectivity, direction and forward momentum that hurt the production. Taymor needs to spend more time next time out connecting the dots, and making sure before shooting she has a strong clear vision of why this is compelling.
B000VZUWZW|5.0|Before this year, I would have said \\"who cares about a writer's strike, in fact, anything that gets Desperate Housewives off the air is a good thing. Unfortunately for me, the writer's strike took this show off the air, and it is a great loss. Writing is hysterical as are the characters in the show. I don't know how long the writer's can keep writing such crisp dialogue, but until it jumps the shark, this show is incredible.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is hands-down the best romantic comedy I've ever seen!  It has it all....great acting by EVERYONE including Eli Wallach, combined with the scenery (JUDE LAW), the excellent chemistry between all of the actors and the music, that for the first time in my life I can say I have a #1 favorite movie.  I love watching movies, it's one of my all-time favorite hobbies and I always hated when someone would ask \\"what's your favorite?\\"   I could never answer that question.   Until now.  I truly love this feel-good film, but it's not for guys since there's no shoot-em-up, blow up the buildings violence, other than the movie trailer scene with Lindsay Lohan and James Franco, and there's no nudity or f-bomb every other word.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|This movie was a great surprise.....we (my husband and I) figured it would be a cute little indie flick, but it was much more powerful because the music actually TELLS the story.  It's not just the story of two people, it's also the story of the evolving songwriter and music transforms their relationship.  My husband is a musician and songwriter and was absolutely blown away by the music, it was so simple but powerful and emotional.  It's one of those movies that you'll watch and when it's over you'll look at each other and say \\"Wow, let's watch that again\\"....and then you'll go to Itunes and buy the soundtrack....it's fabulous.  WATCH THIS MOVIE.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I can't tell you how much I love this movie.  It's one of those films that will be talked about for years to come.  I still hear people talk of this film like it was just released last week or last month.  I also think that the cowboy genre will always be viewed differently now, whether for good or ill.  Still, it's an important topic that at least got attention, thanks to a great director and a wonderful cast.  Ledger will always be known as the lonesome cowboy (may he rest in peace) and Gyllenhaal's soulful eyes can melt even the hardiest and pessimistic souls.
0684803356|3.0|On the back cover of this paperback it's noted that Hemingway is known for his \\"terse\\" sentences. Did the person writing this \\"blurb\\" read the book? Probably not. In parts of this novel the author writes as if possessed by James Joyce, in a stream of consciousness style with long sentences. That's OK, or would be, if they added to the novel but, sorry, they don't. The author is also repetitive, repeating the same point over and over in some cases. But there is no reason in terms of the plot in writing the same point over and over in this book except to (in my opinion) stretch this novella out into almost 500 pages. The first couple and the last couple of chapters are essentially where the action is. One has to ask why this story is so revered and I think the answer is because the author was so admired. The press especially hero-worshiped Hemingway and perhaps this explains the too-much praise for this work. Still, not a bad book and when it's good, it's very good.
B000XRG9IW|5.0|Great CD. Thundering drums, interesting and varied song arrangements. If you like led Zeppelin's song \\"no quarter\\" this CD is for you. Heavy, dark and ominous psych rock at its best.
B00005JKCH|3.0|I'm being nice with my rating. Spiderman is an OK and entertaining enough film, but thats it really. There could have been moments of greatness, but then the Green Goblin showed up...And then there is Kirsten Dunst. I found her completely dislikable, therefore, I couldn't really get into the whole romantic side of the film. The effects were the greatest part of the movie. As far as plot goes, it really could have been better. There are far more superior comic book films out there.
B000ZLFALI|3.0|Perhaps it's lost something on the transfer to the small screen.  At any rate, Julie Taymor's latest feels overwrought in the way that only movie musicals can feel.  Visually stunning? Yes, but it's obvious that the story was painfully forced into shape by cobbling together various Beatles songs.  For what that's worth, the renditions of the songs are quite listenable. Bono in particular does a great job with \\"I am the walrus,\\" while the \\"Come Together\\" sequence is both fun and scary to behold.  Take away the silliness of the scenes and you have a fantastic soundtrack.  In fact, I'd probably recommend that in the end.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|This is a far different sort of comic book movie. It is more serious and important than any other's that I've seen. And more intelligent. Its not just about action sequences and explosions (though there is that). It deals with real issues, sensitive issues. It really makes you think. V is a great character. Beneath his mask, you can tell that he is in pain, physically and mentally. He really is unique and a completely different type of 'hero' than I've ever seen. Hugo Weaving did a great job in portraying emotion without ever taking off the mask. I truly think everyone should watch this film.
0143038419|5.0|What an incredible read! What a moving story of life and love.  I bought 5 more for family and friends.
B00004RFFS|5.0|If anyone has actually read the book, you will know that though not 100% accurate, Tom Cruise does Lestat like no one ever could. I saw the film before ever picking up an Anne Rice novel. This was back in 94 I think. But I loved the movie anyway. It was so different, I literally couldn't get it out of my mind. So I decided to read the book, and I was even more amazed. But the one thing that really got me was that Lestat is exactly like I pictured he would be; Like Tom Cruise made him. Brad Pitt, unfortunetly, wasn't how I pictured him in the book. But, his beautifully sad performance made it only a minor point. This movie is beautiful and seductive. It is unlike any other vampire movie out there, even today. To think, Vampires actually conversing and mingling seamlessly with mortals, without a care in the world and without raising suspicions. What a novel concept! There is no real gore or bloodbaths here. The kills are almost sexual or desperate. Kirsten Dunst embodied Claudia, the little child vampire spawn. She is wickedly perfect here. Even Antonio Banderas as Armand in a short role was perfection(Though he was way too old for the part, again didn't matter). Anne Rice has created this wonderfully visual environment and it is perfectly realized in this movie.
B00005OCMR|5.0|I know a lot of reviews have been done on this movie- as I am typing this there are 22 pages worth of reviews on this movie but it doesn't matter who get to see this review - this movie is a rare treasure for those who likes to be creative and stand out from the rest of the public. For one thing, it uses as its background a type of 80s computer graphic not seen in any movies since after - bold neon colors on a grayish to black background similar to computer and videogames played from that period. By compare, there are 50 or more cowboy movies that are made based on a actual period that last less than four years for the Wild West theme or on actual events like the apache wars which last at least 10 years (I'm not sure exact - I'm not familiar with that period - just bits of facts from that period). The numbers of movies based on 80s theme computers may numbers less than five. There are enemies that break up into polygons like triangles, rhombus instead of dust or other methods and that give it a unique experience. It will also show those who have been born after the 80s an experience of what that period was like.<br />Actually I was introducted to the movie after playing the game, Kingdom Hearts 2 for Playstation 2 - I didn't know it exists because I was a little kid back then and sci fi wasn't my thing.(I'm a late comer)
B00000K19E|5.0|To truly understand this brilliant and original film, you must view it again and again and again. To the point of knowing every single line from beginning to end. Well, that was just me. But then again, I haven't seen a movie this thought-provokingly entertaining since, well, ever. It blew my mind the first time I watched it. My jaw dropped during that first opening scene and to this day, the effects can't be matched. We all know Keanu Reeves cant really act, but he picks his roles wisely. I mean, no acting required really for this role. Well, I'm mostly just kidding. His committment to the film cant be denied. I saw all the behind the scenes footage. I know these actors worked their butts off for this movie. Now that is dedication. There really aren't enough words to properly describe The Matrix. You literally have to see it for yourself. If you find yourself confused-watch it once more.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This have to be Jim Henson's best movie - too bad it is hard to find or unknown by a large number of people - I was shocked to find this movie in a walmart - I thought the muppets, big seasame street and the other characters from the late 80s onwards were Jim Henson's only work (Labyrinth was a except - I saw it in high school class) - I only caught fleeting images of his other works from old Sci Fiction vhs ads which I either rented or watched at other people's home. This movie is amazing - I meant amazing into that it show even ecosystems - not digitalized or anything that are made of puppets or props (no real plants were used or large amount of fake plants) - I can't just stop thinking of that scene which show a fast turtle - like creature chasing fireflies - like creatures into the mouth of a creature which have the vague resemble to Jabba the Hutt that live in the ground which showed its sastify of the meal by blowing and moving the coral/sponge thing on its back in an alien forest ecosystem that is like a hybrid of a coral reef and a tropical rainforest. And that's just the short sideshow - the other characters, while rather clique like other sci fi movies moves and behave like any other modern movies. And that is not to even say of the crab - like golem? guards which are just a secondary character which are able to move its multi legs using just strings and other stage props - no digital erasing - the stage props are invisible to us - the viewer and behave like a creature/machine hybrid with jerking motions and then when it moves away it moves like a living creature. And then there's the ending to this movie - amazing.<br />I would like to recommend this movie to those who like special effects and the work the crew of Jim Henson put in this movie - the story is stale but the special effects and puppets are worth watching
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I don't care what anyone says about Season 3. Those are impatient people who don't have any regard for somthing called Story Line and suspense. Sure, I want to know the answers as well, and quickly. But I understand what the writers of Lost are trying to achieve. They want people to feel clueless and mystified by the show for as long as possible. They give clues throughout but continue to tease. Oh well. I will take that because this show is genius and so entertaining. All the actors do such a fantastic job that its so hard to choose a favorite. Though I do have mine of course. And also, every show in the history of shows has had episodes which may not have been up to par with other better ones, but that is no reason to bash a show as a whole. I had a couple episodes which I didn't enjoy myself. But that is a minor complaint. As a whole, and for 3 whole seasons, I have been addicted to Lost, and no one can convince me otherwise. No show is perfect, but for me, this show is close. And the season finale has got to be one of the best ever in the history of TV.
1416523359|5.0|I really really enjoyed the talent that went into this book. The characters are extremely deep and the emotions they feel are reflected back at you. It's quite impressive. I'll admit that the language gets a bit too cute some time and sometimes it comes off as King being a lil too cocky. Other than that, the story is amazing. It starts off reallyyyy slow, but leads up to one of the best climax's i've read. I liked the way that King made you fear the \\"long boy\\" in this story, but never really told you what it was until the end. Added a flare of mystery that gave the reader another reason to pursue to the end. All in all, great King book.
B000ASDFJU|4.0|It took me a while to actually get into the show, because the first season was the weakest I thought. I never liked the individual one on one with the camera type acting. Thankfully that changed in season 2. And the show got more interesting. I know Sarah Jessica Parker is the star of the show, but I thought her to be the most annoying character. She really isn't a likeable character. Miranda is a close second. Samantha is my favorite but that is because Kim Cattrall really pulls it off in the acting department. Anyway, every character has flaws and weaknesses. Carrie's is Mr. Big, who is actually a favorite character of mine. When he appears on screen I already know the episode is going to be a good one. Now, I don't for one moment believe that any of this is truly realistic. I mean, half the situations the girls find themselves in is ridiculous. And no way can Carrie afford to live where she lives and be able to buy all those shoes and outfits, with her 'job'. Also, I'm still amazed by how much sex these girls really have. Its really eye opening. Again, unrealstic, but it is just a show after all. The good outweighs the bad, etc. I can't wait to see what they're going to do with the movie.
B0002JJBZE|4.0|It's nice to be able to watch the original Star Trek series.  The \\"Second Generation\\" bored me to death.  It was like a science fiction soap opera.  The original series had far more variety, action, and clever innovative plots.  It also had a good bit of humor. The Second Generation seemed to be all about \\"inner space\\" (What's going on inside your head?  How do you FEEL about something, etc.) It seemed to be pitched to the interests of women. (I can feel the feminists coming off the walls already. Oh well - tough!)  I find a good face-off with the Klingons far more entertaining than someone's inner conflict. In summary, I found the product enjoyable and I can even see the episodes I missed.  I now have all three seasons.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|I cannot believe they awarded the best actress oscar to Paltrow over Blanchett. Its criminal! Two completely different performances, yes, but if you had to pick a best actress, Cate should have been it. She was marvelous in this and no one could have played the queen better. The movie itself is beautifully shot, the screenplay rich and informative, while being highly entertaining. Its dramatic and romantic and nail biting all at once. I love watching period films/costume dramas; whatever you wanna call it, this one is up there as one of the best made. Hands down, no question. It may be a bit confusing at first watch, but after a couple more viewings, you really appreciate just how wonderful this film is.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|What an incredible film.  I'm sorry I didn't see it in a theater on the big screen.  A close second was watching the DVD on our 50 inch t.v. and what a treat.  Beautifully capturing the history of the 60's with amazing interpretations of Beatles songs.  It touched me and my husband SO MUCH that we are purchasing it to share with everyone, even our kids (only our oldest was born in the 60's------1969), this will be loved by everyone who sees it, if not, they have no soul.
0767805712|4.0|At first glance, it may look like any other film. But it truly is a sci-fi film and a brilliant one at that. People in the future can choose to have the perfect baby, without ailments and without defects. This is a story of one man, who wasn't so lucky. Ethan Hawke is broodingly perfect in this. His heartfelt performance really carries this film. Jude Law's small but heartbreaking role should not be missed either. Yes its sci-fi, but its so unconventional, you don't need to be a fan to watch this, or vice versa. Its dramatic and depressing and often beautiful too.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|This concert brings together several other performances.  It was so good, I had to order another copy to share with my sister and her husband - the variety of instruments was fascinating.  Definitely worth the price (twice!)
B000001IQH|5.0|I was hesitant about buying this cd at first because I had never heard a song by Rancid before, only suggestions from friends. And the first time I listened to it I hated it, absolutely hated it. It took three months before i put it into my stereo again. I started to like it a little bit more, and a little bit more. Five years, all their cd's, and a couple concerts later Rancid is by far my favorite band. ...And Out Come The Wolves is my favorite album and It can always be found in one of the decks of my stereo. What makes this cd, and all of their stuff, great is the lyrics. Tim's voice is so different from everyone else out there that its really refreshing. Sure they sing about love and girls, but they are intelligent songs about love and girls not like the emo crap out there now. My personal favorites are tracks 1-19. But out of those tracks \\"M.I.A\\", \\"As Wicked\\", and \\"Avenues and Alleyways\\" are my favorite. Buy this Cd and go to their concerts, these guys know how to put on a show, and their music is even better live.
B0011ZNAIC|2.0|Maybe I missed something, but I didn't notice a single reviewer point out the most obvious flaw in this movie: ALL worker bees are FEMALE, not male. Male bees are drones who DO NOT fly away from the hive to collect nectar or pollen. ONLY female worker bees do that. Drones stay in the hive and are fed and cared for by FEMALE worker bees, who also do all the other work in and out of the hive. The male drones' sole--ie, ONLY--function in life is to fly into the air and mate with new queens, after which they die. The only way this bizarre tale could have worked would be for a FEMALE worker bee to play the Seinfeld character, fall in love with a MALE human, then discover how humans are exploiting bees. This is what happens when story and screenplay writers and directors and studio personnel fail to do their homework. It's called research, folks, and it's essential to avoiding ludicrous situations like having MALE worker bees! Maybe Seinfeld could have played a real MALE person and Renee Zellweger could have played a real FEMALE worker bee who fell in love with him. Despite the other obvious flaws in this film, and they are many, at least the movie would have been biologically and scientifically correct.
0399230033|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter, who was under the age of 1 at the time. The reviews here drove me to buy Goodnight Gorilla and to be honest; I was not impressed at first. My daughter however, had a differing opinion; \\"Little D\\" fell in love with it from day one. I believe there is something magical within the pages of this book and KIDS JUST LOVE IT.  WARNING...There are not many words, but that is when a child/parent can use their imagination. I have learned to add gestures, words, and involve my daughter in the actions that is within the books pages. My daughter has now learned to do the actions without my prompting and can say \\"Goodnight Gorilla\\"; so there is an opportunity within the pages to teach/learn.    Among the countless books we have, this book is a must read every night in my 16 month old daughter's eyes. I cannot explain why there is such a strong draw to this book; the only explanation is that IT IS MAGIC! So for the sake of YOUR child, bring the magic into YOUR home.
B000001EAP|5.0|Excellent album and all of the B-sides that go with this album are amazing too.  This is a great U2 album.  I am a huge U2 fan and this is one of my favorite albums.  All of the U2 fans who dis this album are afraid of change.  I say bring it on!

B000VBJEEG|3.0|Disney comes up with another clever story. The graphics are incredible and the story delightful. I would have given it three and a half stars if I could. Although not \\"The Lion King\\" caliber, it is quite good. This may cause some cringes as most people associate rats with filth and disease. The thought of a rat touching your food isnt exactly mouth watering.<br /><br />A rat follows a TV show put on by a French chef and begins to experiament in changing his garbage fare into something more delectable. When he ends up in Paris he tries to help the chef that inspired him by assisting his son in the chef's restaurant. Interesting take on how a food critics perspective changes. Good quality DVD with great replayability.

B000JIHP88|5.0|My son is now 3 months old and since he was born he has been fascinated with this mobile. He does not take his eyes off it. He finds the movement of the leaves intriguing and he is attracted to the bright colors.

B00006AW2J|5.0|After \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\" (not as bad as some critics say, but clearly not one of their best), the Rolling Stones produced a very different album, and one of their best, \\"Beggar's Banquet.\\"  The sound is much sparer than its predecessor, including some country sensibilities.<br /><br />The CD starts out with one of the most well know of Stones' songs, \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\"  While the \\"philosophy\\" behind the song may not be compelling (We all killed the Kennedys?), this is a fine rock and roll work. The work begins with percussion, some yelps by Jagger, and keyboard.  After a bit, the rest of the band comes in, with growling guitar work.  There is some social and political commentary here, not always typical of the Rolling Stones.  One of their greatest hits indeed.<br /><br />Another iconic song, a book end, if you will, to \\"Jumping Jack Flash,\\" appears on this CD--\\"Street Fighting Man.\\" This is a play on an earlier hit, \\"Dancing in the Streets.\\" There is an interesting juxtaposition between the singer wanting to be a \\"street fighting man\\" and the context of living in \\"sleepy London town.\\" So, \\"What can a poor boy do but sing for a rock and roll band?\\"  A wonderful rocker!<br /><br />And so many other fine, spare, and often underappreciated songs.<br /><br />Praise to the common working people in \\"Salt of the Earth.\\"  \\"Stray Cat Blues,\\" a raunchy rocker with a strong blues sensibility.  \\"Factory Girl,\\" another paean to the working class.  \\"No Expectations,\\" \\"Jigsaw Puzzle,\\" and so on.<br /><br />This is a Rolling Stones' work that seems to have a social and political sensibility--and is also a fine work of rock and roll.  They play with country music and still retain a Stones' sound.  This is probably one of their best, and it suggests that sometimes less is better.  Anyhow, what a fine work!
1582701709|5.0|This is a wonderful book and should be in every classroom along with the film of the same title.
B0001IMKTA|4.0|I AM THE CAT FISH MAN? Jeez, where did Neal come up with that one. Well on to the review..... The first time I have listen to this diamond in th rough I was amazed with music and lyrics of The light and was amazed by the changes of melodies that flow smoothly through out the song. Next is go the way you go; Very melodic and downright awesome. Then along came The Water, which I think the song is a little too much to swallow on the first listen, but grows on you as time goes on and yes the profanity fits perfectly at that part of the song. C'mon we all have felt that way at times. Now, to my favorite Out On the Edge. This song is the shortest and the best on the album. After hearing the song once,you will sing the song in your head for the rest of the day.    There is something missing from this album. That is Ryo Okomoto, who comes to the band on the next album Beware of Darkness. The band definitly has more depth when he joins the band. What I like about this special edition is Neal's biography of the album of how it was made. Overall not their very best but still awesome to own and listen. You will unfortunatly not hear these gems on the radio, SO BUY THE DISC!!!
B00003CXAA|5.0|I don't need to write anything about the films.  You wouldn't be reading this is you didn't like them anyway.  I thought the quality of video and sound was great.  The extras were fun and interesting.  There were things I did not know which made this collection a good buy for me.  I never knew most of the things I saw in the bonus sections.  Seeing James Caan audition for Michael was very weird and then learning that virtually everyone wanted him as Michael was even odder to imagine.  There are lots of interviews and some deleted scenes as well.  All in all this is a great collection of some of the finest cinematic performances on film.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|\\"Resident Evil: Extinction: is a good entry in the trilogy.  Milla Jovovitch returns as Alice (I still don't know her last name) who is riding on a motorcycle through the desert wasteland of Nevada like Mel Gibson in \\"Mad Max.\\"  The world has been destroyed by the T-virus.  Now, she travels solo, attempting to help those in need as she searches for gasoline which is in very short supply.  Also, the T-virus has given her telekinetic powers.  She, like a caravan of survivors, are looking for a safe haven, as do many survivors of apoocalyptic, end-of-the world movies.  She encounters a group of hillibillies who have been capturing anyone who answers their distress calls and throwing them into an arena of mutant dobermans.  There is a great scene reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's \\"The Birds.\\"  Crows infected with the T-virus attack survivors of a convoy.  \\"Extinction\\" is much darker and more depressing than the first two.  There seems little hope for mankind's survival.  This time around, Alice battles zombies who have been genetically engineered to be much more agressive.  She also discovers another underground, hive-like laboratory owned by the Umbrella Corporation.  When she enters it, she encounters the most diabolical mutant of all.  Like its predecessors, \\"Extinction\\" has a \\"Twilight Zone\\" ending.  Hopefully, another sequel will follow.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Based on a true story, The Pursuit of Happyness (which stars Will Smith and his actual son Jaden) is about Chris Gardner. Chris is a smart, capable guy, but he's gotten himself into a bad situation. He sunk his life savings into selling bone density scanners, which don't seem to be moving very quickly. And his girlfriend Linda (played by Thandie Newton, looking as bad as a person that gorgeous can look), who's been working double shifts to make ends meet, gets fed up. She's going to leave him and take the kid, but Chris won't let her. So she leaves him AND the kid. Here's where things get interesting. In an effort to better their situation, Chris applies for a competitive broker internship. He's learned that out of a pool of 20 interns, only one will be offered a job at the end of the six-month program. He gets the internship. Problem? It's unpaid.<br /><br />So, Chris has to start selling some scanners, FAST. He has moderate success, but there are still times when the father/son team is living pretty close to the bone. During some scenes, such as when the little family finds itself homeless for a while, I almost cried. These are the kinds of characters I can root for. Chris is doing everything possible to keep body and soul together and make a future for himself and his son. And sometimes, it still isn't enough. But the guy just won't give up. He powers through the worst of circumstances. He puts a brave face on for his kid. He keeps his wits about him. He doesn't cave. You gotta love a guy like that.<br /><br />Will Smith is great in this. He must have gotten in awesome shape, too, because he spends alot of the movie in a flat-out run. (Talk about hustle.) And Jaden is adorable. His sweet, soft little-boy face. His good nature. His ultimate trust in his dad (on screen and off). A totally effortless performance, it was perfect for this movie. You will love this kid.<br /><br />I recommend The Pursuit of Happyness. And if you're a parent, I doubly recommend it. It's absolutely inspirational.l.
0684833395|5.0|If the \\"Lance Corporal Underground\\" had a reading list, Catch-22 would be at the top. From the sociopathic commanders to the stupidity of the mission requirements increasing endlessly and unnecessarily, all of the hilarious absurdities cataloged in this novel are daily realities for anyone involved in the military. Well, they WOULD be hilarious if they were mere fiction.
B000LXHK2C|2.0|In A Good Year, Russell Crowe plays Max Skinner, a moneygrubbing banker in fast-paced London. Max is focused only on generating profits, and he has no personal relationships in his life to speak of. After a bumper business day (involving ethically questionable behaviors), Max comes home to find a letter notifying him that his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney), who he used to spend his summers with, has died. Because Henry left no formal written will, and because Max is his only living relative, all of Henry's possessions (which include a sizable estate and vineyard in Provence) go to Max. Max packs up his bags and heads to Provence to do a quick assessment of the estate and prepare it for sale.<br /><br />Of course, once Max arrives in France, Provence (and a lovely lady, played by Marion Cotillard) sinks into his bones. In addition, the vineyard jumpstarts Max's memory, invoking all the grand adventures he had on the estate with Uncle Henry. (Freddie Highmore plays Max as a child.) Lastly, an attractive American shows up, claiming to be Uncle Henry's illegitimate daughter (complicating decisions about the estate).<br /><br />My favorite parts of the movie were the flashbacks of Max as a child at the vineyard. Highmore and Finney had a nice on-screen relationship, and the golden-tinted light had just the right hazy, halcyon quality to evoke memory.<br /><br />Overall, however, the movie had a really predictable storyline and smacked of a French version of Under the Tuscan Sun. Not a must-see.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This was an excellent production! While it might not exactly follow the book, it comes closer than many film adaptations of the written version. The acting and filming were superb. I am very happy that I chose to purchase it. I watch it over and over!
B00005JPNZ|1.0|... hope that George Lucas, in his infinite wisdom, when assembling this film, will not make the same MISTAKE that he made with the Star Wars prequel films and say, \\"Hey, why don't we take some of John Williams' old, unrelated music from the OTHER films, and mix this in?\\"<br />As a diehard Williams fan, nothing was more irritating than watching \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" and seeing Yoda battle Palpatine, accompanied by COPIED music taken from Empire Strikes Back!<br /><br />Now is Lucas going to do the same devious trick with \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\"?  Oh how I hope not, but I don't think Lucas is beyond doing this.  \\"Hmmm, maybe we can just reuse some of the 'Nazi submarine' theme in the new film...\\"<br /><br />Honestly, what was the deal with Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith?  Did anyone else other than me notice the grotesque reuse of music?  Is it going to be the same thing with Indy 4?<br />I sure hope not.  On the slim chance that Lucas reads early speculative film reviews on Amazon (hahahahahahaha) I'm hear to say:  George Lucas, PLEASE do not edit John Williams music from Indiana Jones 4!  Leave it all in the film exaclty the way he and the LSO seem fit to perform it!  We do not need to hear the same music cut-n-pasted from a different, unrelated Indiana Jones films.  Do John Williams' fans around the world a huge favor and put a leash on your music and sound editors.
0440238609|4.0|One thing that I will note is that if you're very religious (in particular Christian), then you may not enjoy this series as it gets to be very critical of any organized religion (and in particular, Christianity).    But if you can get past that, then I highly recommend this trilogy.

B000FIMG68|5.0|I received the second season of Lost in a million little pieces, one of my sons most wanted gifts, I did not know and wrapped it up, on Christmas day, we all found this out. I wrote to Amazon and got a speedy reply and was told they would ship a new one and all I had to do was return the damaged one in 2 weeks time with a pre paid mailer. What could be easier? I mailed the bad one back the next day , and never had such an easy return of a product. Thank you again.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|This is truly an original cinematic experience. I have never seen such a personal and compelling film biography. It continues the legacy began by \\"Elizabeth I.\\" Every moment was filled with such noble and human living. It simply astounds me that so many reviewers didn't realize that this was a Jungian study in the clash of a major archtype with the world in which she lived and ruled. This Elizabeth was superbly realized with none of the ticks of Bette Davis or the overt sexuality of Helen Mirren. Blanchett gave us a chance to see into the real Virgin Queen. This woman was not sexually frustrated, but in full control of her passions tempered with grace and personal integrity. She claimed her life and owned it with every fiber of her being. The supporting cast was perfect down to Tom Hollander as Mary Stuart's jailor. Samantha Morton gave an exquisite portrayal of a queen caught in the force of history. Clive Owen, as usual, was every inch the hero archtype.    If you have any sense of what it is to an individual in a heartless society, you will never get a moment to breathe, so mesmerizing is Kapur's direction and the simply balletic cinematography. Every costume is a statement of the character's feelings at every moment and the progression of color leads you to the ending that you know you're going to reach, but still can't is going to come to fruition.    In the decades to come, \\"Elizabeth-The Golden Age\\" will become the movie that the critics just didn't know how to approach. In this year of absolutely mediocre films (excepting \\"Michael Clayton\\")I cannot believe that this film was not on everybody's Top Ten List.    But then we as a film-going public do not appreciate the operatic, the sensuous, the heroic. We gravitate toward the bleak, violent worlds of the Coen Brothers and Clint Eastwood that foster hopelessness and alienation.    In the future, when critics are rediscovering \\"Elizabeth--The Golden Age,\\" remember you heard it here first.

0525950079|4.0|How Do You Write a 929-page Novel?<br /><br />You start with four little kids who wander out into the woods near Kingsbridge, a medieval town. They've been warned that the woods are dangerous, and sure enough, they witness two of the Queen's men chasing another man. Two of the men are killed, one of them with an arrow shot by one of the kids.<br /><br />Each of the four kids has a plot line. Two of them are brothers, Merthin and Ralph, sons of a local knight. Then there's Gwenda, daughter of a poor laborer and cut purse, and Caris, a born leader who is also the daughter of the town alderman. Merthin and Caris fall in love, but she doesn't want to be a man's possession. She wants to be a doctor, but only monks can be doctors. Gwenda is also in love with Wulfric, a serf who is due to inherit land. But, alas, he's in love with another girl. Although he's younger than Merthin, Ralph is chosen to be a squire to the Earl of Roland. His plot line involves his efforts to be chosen a knight. Merthin is apprenticed to a carpenter; he must spend seven years as an unpaid apprentice.<br /><br />Another way to stretch the novel is to use the historical epic, the One Hundred Years War and the Plague years in this case. Ralph fights alongside the Earl in Normandy during Edward III's attempt to claim his birthright as king of France. The plague comes and goes three times during the 929-page novel.<br /><br />We also have an ongoing battle between the town and the priory. The town must pay a toll to the priory to use the bridge. The priory interferes in Guild activities and elections. The serfs must also work the lord's land and if there is no heir he decides who gets the land.<br /><br />All of this would be some what repetitive if it weren't for the great villains in this piece. Ralph Fitzgerald is a cold-blooded killer and rapist who is at one point condemned to die, but he's needed at a man-at-arms to fight in the Normandy wars and he always manages to escape his just desserts. You will want to see Ralph boiled in oil. The other one is sort of a combination character, Godwyn, who ultimately finagles his way to become prior. Godwyn pretends to be a progressive leader who will help the townsmen build a new bridge, but he's really only interested in power. Godwyn also has a partner, Philomen, Gwenda's worthless brother. Godwyn helps Philomen become a monk and Philomen will do anything for Godwyn.<br /><br />Another smart move on Follett's part was to skip ahead in the action, usually in ten-year segments. I began to look forward to these \\"jump cuts\\" when the action got to be too repetitive. The romantic segments can be a bit sappy as well. You will like this in the same way you liked FOREVER AMBER, if you happened to have read that suspect classic.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel despite myself, even if it was a long haul (took me over three weeks to read it). You could take these characters out of the 14th century and put them in 2008. I would imagine that was what Follett hoped the reader would do..

B00000JGHM|5.0|A great movie. It redefined the cops and robbers genre. DeNiro and Pacino on the big screen together makes for some great scenes and some really strong dialogue. And, without a doubt, the best gunfight scene ever filmed. At three hours, it does run a bit long.
0765318741|4.0|Aside from drinking alone and hording dry goods, Robert Neville enjoys barricading his house and playing hide-and-go-stake with his neighbors.  This life, which has been thrust upon him by a widespread plague, tests the limits of human loneliness and misery, and also human accomplishment and transcendence.  Some of the most memorable scenes for me are those involving the dog that Neville finds.  After surviving in a solitary existence for so long (being taunted by dead friends and tempted by cold, naked flesh), he all but gives up hope of ever seeing another living thing.  A wandering mutt renews his hope in a hopeless situation, and gives him a better reason for living than existing out of habit.  I Am Legend is less about monsters and cellular warfare than it is about the last man alive learning what truly defines humanity.
6305907145|5.0|I remember watching this in 1999 when it came out and not liking it.  I just reread the book and decided to give it another go.  I loved it!  It was so beautifully done and brought in the history of the time with added clarity.  Even though some of the things were not in the book specifically, they fit into the puzzle, adding some deeper colors that fit into the period. For example with the understanding of slavery in that time and what was really going on in places like Antigua.

B000XJ5TOK|2.0|First off, let me say this. I love the Resident Evil movies, almost as much as the first 3 games. That being said let me best describe my review in a short but concise way as to why I gave it 2 stars.<br /><br />I have this movie on DVD as well. I have an upscaling DVD player. My upscaled DVD version of this movie looks almost exactly the same as the supposed High Definition Blu Ray version using a PS3 on a Sharp Aquos 1080p LCD TV. I don't know the reason behind the lack of fidelity and image clarity, but honestly, except to say you have the Blu Ray version with the rest (I got the 2nd movie for free in that 5 free movies deal), go with upscaled DVD. The sound quality is better on BluRay, but not so much better it warrants buying the Blu Ray over the regular DVD movie.<br /><br />Heck, I saw it on TV on an HD channel and it looked the same, that is, nothing special.<br /><br />So it looks ok, but don't expect superb quality, and instead expect a lot of graininess.
0385733577|5.0|Having read about the character of Nicholas Flamel in the first Harry Potter novel, I was intrigued to see another book mentioning the same person.  I decided to give this book a try, and I loved it!  All the characters are well written, and except for the twins, all the characters really existed.  The true story of Nicholas and Perenelle (his wife) is equally mysterious.  I anxiously await book #2 in this wonderful series!

B0002O0CM0|3.0|The pair of releases found the band attempting to move forward after Jim Morrison's untimely death. The results were mixed, with Other Voices still packing some punch, while Full Circle shows clear signs of artistic exhaustion.<br /><br />Released in October 1971, Other Voices contains material the trio was working on when Morrison was in France. Robby Krieger and Ray Manzarek are the vocalists and the songs retain the synergy the group had over the years with Morrison.<br /><br />Full Circle, issued in August 1972, finds the music taking a more jazz approach, which in itself should not be surprising, as the sound revolution through fusion was about to rock the music industry. But the door had closed on the band's creative energy and most fans clearly read those signs; the single - The Mosquito - stalled at number eigthy-five on the Hot 100 list.<br /><br />That the band attempted to continue after the tragedy cannot be dismissed. But The Doors could not regroup after losing a frontman who was a larger-than-life icon in pop culture.

On the back of the case is says that the DVD is copy protected. Since Columbia is owned by Sony, who are famous for messing with established formats in an attempt to prevent casual copying (but which does nothing to stop real piracy since \\"rip\\" copies were available weeks ago), it's not surprising that they'd release a DVD that can't be played on all players.

B00004XONN|4.0|When Kid A was first released, it was with alot of fanfare.I,personally didnt like or get it.But,over time,its been 7 years now,it has grown on me.The disc stands up well.I was literally blasting the tune Optimistic the other day and couldnt believe how great it sounded.I hit the repeat button and left it.The thing that I wasnt crazy about when I first heard this disc, was that the songs lacked punch.I was lucky enough, to see the band live at Victoria Park,Warrington,England, on October 2,2000.It was a kickoff gig for Kid A.They opened with The National Anthem.I thought..wow,that first song blew me away.then I heard the studio version and well,the song wasnt as strong.It lost something.Live, the bass riff came flying out at us in attendance.But the studio version is kinda flat.Whats with the horns?They take away from the song.The same goes for In Limbo.The punch,compared to the live versions,are absent.Everything In Its Right Place sounds very good here,as does Idioteque.Solid songs.In my opinion,when performing live,Thom doesnt whine as much.(BBC Radio 1 recorded this show,as well as a gig from Oxford,07/07/01). Listen to the difference when you hear Everything,Idioteque and Morning Bell live,compared to the studio versions.The band released I Might Be Wrong,8 songs from Kid A/Amnesiac only.I believe they did this because they feel as I do,those tracks sound better live.The BEST song of this disc , without question,IMO, is the tune How To Disappear Completely.This is quite possibly their best song.When they played this song live,all of us in Victoria Park froze.Its a slow,epic song.The amazing thing is, you could here traffic outside the park,not the thousands of fans at the gig.Fantastic moment I wont soon forget.Thom saying how \\"in a lil while he will be gone\\"...how he \\"isnt here\\"..and this \\"isnt happening\\".Its sends chills up my spine when I think about that live performance in Warrington.This version on Kid A has the same feeling.IMO,Pyramid Song,Knives Out and IMBW would have fit in quite nicely on Kid A.Treefingers,MPS could have been b sides.Peace.
B00005JPTI|5.0|Here's why: the second half of the movie still worked great for me. I have not read the book, though I now am an owner, about to start it. As cinema, the movie makes for a great character piece. Where Tom Keogh believes that Will Smith's Dr. Neville becomes too messianic in the end, I feel that it is more indicative of the loss of self and the need for purpose that any intelligent man may face in the loss of all things human. The need to serve that purpose, to keep the world from ending, and psychologically keep the events beyond his control from happening, are a representation of the battle the character's psyche goes through every single day. This is a continually renewed battle, which he wins against every single day, until later in the film, when he suffers another, equally significant loss (specifics omitted, this is not a spoiler). All in all, having seen nothing save an early teaser trailer, this movie came to me as a great surprise. My expectations were not set going in to see the movie, but found an excellent character piece with some great acting and visual effects. Some might classify it as not being a true piece of cinema, due to some science fiction themes, though I find that such a classification does not do the film justice.
0441013597|5.0|I've enjoyed this book for over 20 years now and have read it multiple times. This is probably the best and most accessible version published to date. It is a masterpiece in literature, with adventure, intrigue, politics and many allusions to how our own world was in regards to the early 60s and even today. A must have if you are a sci-fi fan.
B000VAPZM2|1.0|For the most part, I would say HSM2 was better than HSM1 (although HSM1 didn't exactly pose good competition).  I thought the characters were (to some extent) more realistic.  They worried about things teens would actually worry about, such as paying for college.  In the first one all they cared about was, and I quote \\"People doing things that aren't their thing\\".  I also felt like I got a complete story in this one.  You at least got to see the talent show in HSM2 while they barely gave you any information much less let you see the all-important musical in HSM1, which left me with a feeling of  \\"that's it?\\".  I'm afraid those are the only good things I can say however.       The plot could've been better, a lot better.  A bunch of teenagers, including the movie's lead couple, Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez, get summer jobs at a country club.  The country club holds an annual talent show, and awards the Star Dazzle trophy to the best act.  The teenagers decide to participate.  The antagonist, Sharpay Evans (who also happens to be the country club's owner's daughter) has won the Star Dazzle trophy every year for a long time and is afraid the teenagers mentioned above will win it instead.  In an effort to stop them, she tries to break up Troy and Gabriella, who she holds a grudge against because they won the lead roles in the high school musical that the first movie was named for.  She succeeds temporarily, but of course they get back together and everyone is happy in the end.  It's Disney, what do you expect?  Sharpay decides to be nice for no reason at all, not seeming to mind that Troy ditched singing with her to sing with Gabriella instead.  They all sing \\"All for One\\", by the pool, a song about how they're all going to be friends after this.  Funny, the last movie had a similar ending but Sharpay was mean again in this one.  The same thing will probably happen in HSM3.  Yes, they're going to curse us with another one, and it's even going to come out in theaters so they can make more money.  The only thing that wasn't predictable about HSM2 was how the Star Dazzle trophy went to Sharpay's brother, Ryan, instead of Troy and Gabriella as everyone expected.   There were a few parts that were actually supposed to made me laugh that succeeded, such as when Troy was giving golf lessons, but for the most part the humor had too much of the \\"Oh puh-leeze\\" factor.  The romance was as pathetic as ever.  I found it stupid how there were so many times when Troy and Gabriella came inches away from kissing but were always interrupted.  This got really old really quickly, and after the first time you could see it coming from miles away.  You could also see it coming when they finally do kiss at the end, when everybody is playing in the sprinklers.  I don't see why that scene was necessary.  The kiss I understand, but what is so entertaining about a bunch of teenagers playing in some sprinklers?  The music, I don't even want to go there...but I will.      The songs were just as bad as those in the first one.  If you expect to enjoy any of the musical numbers, you'll have to throw all logic out the window.  If not, you'll be asking questions like \\"What's a Pepto-Bismol pink piano doing in the middle of the pool?\\"  \\"Since when are baseball and dancing the `same game'\\" \\"How come their boss doesn't hear them bursting out in song in the kitchen\\" \\"How'd Gabriella get back into the country club if she quit and why would she even if she could?\\"  \\"How can Troy and Gabriella still know the words to a song that they've supposedly never heard before when they're no longer reading over Kelsi's shoulder and how can we hear instruments besides a piano when it's obvious that the piano is the only instrument in the room?\\" \\"Wouldn't they get in trouble for bouncing basketballs in the hallway?\\" \\"Why is her so-called iced tea blue?\\" and \\"What is Zac Efron doing dancing around on the golf course like an idiot?\\" I will admit this is somewhat true with anymusical, but not nearly as much as with \\"High School Musical 2\\".  Songs like \\"Gotta Go My Own Way\\" are supposed to make you cry, but instead are just flat out corny.  You know they're going to get back together in the end, so why get upset now?  The only good thing about the songs is that the filmmakers were at least smart enough to delete \\"Humahumanukanukapua'a\\" or whatever it is. That has to be the dumbest song I've ever heard.       The acting was pretty bad too.  Ashley Tisdale tries waaaaaaayyyy too hard as Sharpay that the character is no longer believable.   Perhaps it's the writers' fault because none of the characters are that great.  The problem is just that...they're characters.  Good writers/actors can turn their characters into living, breathing people that you actually care about.  The characters of HSM are obviously fake, because I don't think anyone is as superficial as Sharpay and I don't think anyone is as gay as Ryan or as sugary sweet as Gabriella or as look-at-me-I'm-so-cool as Troy.  The Troy character is not supposed to be this way, he's supposed to be a popular jock who's not that full of himself and is still approachable. Efron turns it into the same popular jock character we see in every other movie.  The only difference is that this jock actually has a lead role in the movie, as opposed to just being the guy all the girls throw themselves at, having no significant role besides this.  Perhaps people like the HSM characters really do exist but I still think they make bad characters.  Disney also seems to put these same, clichéd characters in every tv show and movie they make.  Are writers too lazy to come up with unique, original characters anymore?  Whether it's the writers' or the actors' fault, you get the point: none of the characters became real to me.       It didn't seem like any of the actors/actresses were good singers either.  Ashley Tisdale has to have the worst voice ever to get a record deal, and it sounds even worst when theycomputerize it to sound like a robot, such as in \\"Fabulous\\".  While better than Tisdale, Vanessa Hudgens still left much to be desired in her vocal performance.  Corbin Bleu was probably the worst of the male singers, and didn't show much range, probably because he doesn't have much of a range.  I can give props to Zac Efron because unlike the first movie, he didn't lip-sync to someone else's voice.  He actually wasn't that bad and is probably a better singer than he is an actor.  The part that made me mad was how those that actually could sing, (Lucas Grabeel and Monique Coleman) got the fewest solos.  This is probably because they don't have record deals with Disney like Vanessa and Corbin do or Ashley, who has one with Warner Bros.   Disney probably self promotes themselves more than any other movie company, so naturally they favor the recording \\"artists\\" who make them money despite the fact that there are more talented singers in the cast.      I can see how this would be a cute movie for young children, but when I meet teenagers who are crazy about it, I wonder what our society is coming too.   Both \\"High School Musical\\" movies are completely over-rated, and do not deserve to be as successful and popular as they are.   Disney Channel makes lots of \\"original\\" movies that adults have never heard even heard of but are still entertaining for kids.  \\"High School Musical\\" and \\"High School Musical 2\\" should be like all of those, and not considered the best things that ever happened to the movie industry.
B000U66PK8|5.0|It was very interesting the read about his life & the difficulties he had growing up. I found myself unable to put the book down. The only let down for me was he did not elaborate much on his marriage Tana & their family. I would be interested in hearing more about it.
B000W07EKW|5.0|Excellent triple set of decent action movies--a newer \\"Bond\\" series, so to speak.  I cannot stand Damon's political views, but what are you going to do if you want to see a relatively exciting movie.....?  GOOD buy, getting three widescreen thrillers in one box.
B00004X10B|5.0|This bag is just what I wanted.  It holds all my stuff including several lenses,  2 camera bodies, 2 flashes and a bracket and has pockets everywhere for cards, batteries, filters...  It is sturdy (lots of padding) and well made and I couldn't be happier with it.  It is a fantastic camera bag!
B000VNMMQQ|5.0|Live Free or Die Hard is a RELENTLESS action film, with killer stunts, wonderful special effects and a great plot. It also has a good deal of classic humor, (Justin Long is perfect in his role) and of course, a heaping helping of Bruce Willis' attitude.   Definately a must see!
1559211407|5.0|What a great movie this story made. I have watched the movie many, many times and have loved it every time. Now, I just had to read the book. The strange thing is that since I know what is going to occur at the end, my eyes become teared which makes the book difficult to read. Of course, that happens at certain moments in the movie as well. What a powerful story!
B0009UC7HA|5.0|Ok, so, admitedly, I'm a huge Clive Cussler fan boy. I've been reading his novels for several years, and love each one more than the last. So... I can tell you that this film is NOT exactly like a Cussler novel (it moves a little differently, the tone of the story is different, and Giordino and Rudi are totally different from their roles in the books.) I will tell you though, Matthew is PERFECT as Dirk and Steve (while totally different than Al Giordino) embodies the role in great spirit.<br />So, in short, if you love Cussler's characters (and the style of his action/adventure plots) but won't kill yourself over quite a few differences, you'll love this film to pieces.

He was a brilliant and innovative artist with a legacy of several classic CDs. Occasionally there is a surprise improvement but the prognosis is terminal. Purchase Oldfield's albums in chronological order and you won't be disappointed because you will only buy one too many.  The title says it all.  Mike is on an astral voyage.  The album is ear-wash.

0439813786|5.0|I think of this work as a synthesis of book and movie.  Just amazing.  I suggest it's best enjoyed on a visual and emotional level.  Try to be a kid again and enjoy it without excessive analysis and criticism.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I have despised both the Beatles and the 1960s era for as long as I can remember. Yet, I saw this movie in October when it first hit theaters, and I am still singing along with the soundtrack. Here I am watching it on DVD now, and I am falling in love all over again with the relationships that build throughout the movie. This movie has two incredible things going for it: Fantastic casting, and amazing-beyond-amazing Beatles covers. Newcomer Jim Sturgess and edgy-but-innocent-looking Evan Rachel Wood have the most INCREDIBLE chemistry in this film. All the supporting characters are necessary (even the overrated Bono). All the performances are believable. The film's art style pushes the envelope without looking like it's trying too hard.    Bottom line: Watch this movie. I was reluctant because, as I said before, I don't find much appeal in the Beatles or the 1960s era, and yet I can't tear myself away from this film.

0143038419|4.0|A friend gave this book to me.  I enjoy when a friend gives me a book that takes me out of my normal comfort zone, which would be thrillers and mysteries, with an occasional science fiction thrown in for good measure.  Eat, Pray, Love is certainly not one of those.  The book is currently on the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction paperbacks, which I have to admit mystifies me somewhat.<br /><br />The book traces the story of the author as she chooses to shed her well-planned life of marriage and family for the adventure of finding herself by visiting three countries that hold a lot of interest for her:  Italy, India, and Indonesia.  She had made a deal with her husband that they would think about having children when she turned 30, but when that happened, she found that she still just didn't want that kind of life.  Her book documents each phase of her recovery from a nasty divorce and recovery from a relationship that she had after the divorce.  In Italy, she indulges in the food and culture and learns the language.  In India, she attends an Ashram where she learns mediation and yoga, and in Indonesia, she helps a medicine man by just being a friend, and in turn learns to be a friend.  Throughout the entire book, she seems to be searching for God and her own spiritual self, asking and answering her own questions while learning to be comfortable with herself.<br /><br />The book is exceedingly well-written, drawing you easily into the author's inner turmoil and struggle to find herself.  It's often peppered with a wry humor that keeps you turning the pages.  Elizabeth Gilbert is definitely a gifted writer, as it's not easy to write an entire third of a book about yoga and meditation and still have it be a bestseller.<br /><br />I also had some problems with the book, though.  At first, I couldn't put my finger on the problem, but about two thirds of the way through the book I realized what it was:  the secondary characters in the book are extremely one-dimensional.  I honestly didn't care about David, her lover after her marriage failed, and her ex-husband was simply that -- an ex-husband.  No more, no less.  At one point in Italy, she has a Thanksgiving dinner with all of her new friends, but because we really haven't gotten to know any of these people very well, we don't really feel the love in what is really a nice moment in the book.  In addition, there is a character in the second third of the book, Richard from Texas, who is larger than life and everything he says seems filled with wisdom.  I found myself desperately wanting more Richard and less Elizabeth during that time.  It's not until the last third that the secondary characters start becoming real people.  I felt like I got to know Ketut the Medicine Man and Wayan the Healer, and I found myself suddenly caring how the book would end.<br /><br />The middle of the book, with the long descriptions of her own meditation and conversations with herself, are not exactly page turners.  I felt like Elizabeth was finally growing up, but then she would do something silly, which I found tiresome.  I groaned out loud when, in the final section, she arrives in Indonesia without any kind of plan.  You mean she went all this time, and didn't have a single idea as to what would happen when she got to Bali?  She hadn't contacted the medicine man to find out if he was still even alive?  Holy Cow.  Luckily, she does do an awful lot of growing in the last part of the book, so that I started looking forward to picking it up and reading it again.<br /><br />I expressed my mystification about this being a nonfiction bestseller to my mother-in-law, and she had an insight that I think is right.  Let's face it, this is a story about a woman who sheds her current life and goes off and has adventures, and really seems to have a good time doing it.  How many women dream of doing just that?  Perhaps that is the attraction.<br /><br />Overall, I give this book a \\"Not Bad, Glad I Read It\\" rating.\\" rating.

B000ZLFALI|1.0|I can't quite sum up why I didn't like this movie, but I'll try and I'll start with the feelings it gave while I was watching and when I left the theatre with the film still inside my head.  It always feels jumbled and uninspired with a focus on postmodern concepts of the period, music, lyrics, personalities etc.  The one thing that amazed me was this: despite being full of Beatles songs, lyrics, characters named from their songs, period correct clothes, drugs, sex, attitudes, and looks, it still felt as if nothing was tied together.  The Beatles songs are adventurous and organic, to me, and this movie betrayed those two things for a large portion.  I didn't expect, or want a revival show, but the material provided by this movie sucked, more or less. Only a few of the versions prove to be interesting enough to exist (happiness is a warm gun, come together, being for the benefit of mr. kite), none of the characters stand out, and the visual style is scattershot saccharine which saps even psychedelia of it's authenticity. The film is just painfully bland when it should be edgy. It doesn't allow any dramatic payoff because there's no depth, or development, it just runs along. I'm not a fan of Julie Taymor, because I find her to be a visual stylist who can't make a satisfying film from front to back, but can occasionally dazzle you. Here, she tries that and is only successful once (during mr. kite).  There are moments of good performances to be found in this movie, but the rest of movie made me forget, or at least become mad that they weren't more frequent.  This movie did make me mad while watching it because it seems that they often weren't going for anything in particular except an honorary invitation to the 21st century extravaganza club (big films without true joy, or emotion). Roger Ebert is intelligent in his opinions, but has been wrong more than once about the films he chooses to review these days, at least I didn't agree him that is.  He said he didn't even want to hear the argument that the songs weren't like the original versions, stating that they're timeless songs that belong to no one. I didn't want, or expect them to be, Roger, but you have to consider there's a reason these particular songs were chosen and are considered timeless.  It's because they were well-written and brilliantly performed pop songs.  When you take out the inspiration for these songs and make them fit your own revisionist purposes....they're not so timeless, they're disposable.  They also have no backing within a true story, it's only a plot that's as thin as the paper used to play the game Thin Ice and unconvincing like Clinton saying he had no sexual relations with...you know. Add to that the fact the brilliance with which these songs were performed is gone and often without exuberance, or true spirit. Sometimes the film and music come together and make up for this like in the bowling scene for \\"I've just seen a face\\" but these times of excellence are few and far between. The film tries to overcompensate by having every visual be a symbol and it just becomes monotonous and tiring thing to endure. It actually makes the film harder to take for me. I actually thought of walking out and kind of wish I did. I'll say the last gripe that I can remember before I end this acknowledged hate-fest of this film and end it quickly. The film takes a wide open approach to the ideology and activism of the time and in some ways presents a wide open movie full of such non-mainstream elements like casual sex, hippie posturing, Vietnam rehashing, drugs. I say non-mainstream because the 60's presents a type simultaneous naivete and danger concerning these subjects that's never developed in this movie so as a result you get the sex without the hornyness, or joy, the hippiness without the stupidity, the radicalism without the conscience, and violence...well, there wasn't really any violence in it, or drugs for that matter, it just feels fake. The film is pg-13 and it's riding R, and even material that would bypass that into the NC-17 arena, but because we're dealing with Beatles songs they don't even passably go all the way (in so many ways). This treatment feels dishonest to me and should never, ever, have been.  It makes me feel like I imagine I would if I were to watch the Sergeant Pepper movie with the Bee Gees. Like that movie, this movie should never have been made.t's riding R, and even material that would bypass that into the NC-17 arena, but because we're dealing with Beatles songs they don't even passably go all the way (in so many ways).

B000P0I4O4|2.0|Cusack has been in some so-so movies, but previously I would have given Freeman more credit than this.  I hadn't read any reviews of this moving going in, but it quickly became clear the writing was awful.  This movie is bad: bad writing, unbelievable sequences, cliched characters, you name it.  This movie reminded repeatedly me of those bad, low budget action movies you used to see a lot of in the 70's and early 80's - especially those made for TV.  I did get a few kicks out of movie, but it was inevitably because the script was just so horrible.  Did I mention the writing was awful?  Give it a pass.

B00000D9TQ|3.0|A 1998 compilation which at first glance is pretty impressive but could have been ultimate if it simply included \\"I missed again\\" (his first massive hit) and of course \\"Don't lose my number\\" (huge 1985 hit). I think alot of us are confused by the ommission of these and the inclusion of inferior songs such as \\"Into the light\\", and possibly \\"True Colours\\" (this Cyndi Lauper cover was mainly included because it was a single he released at the same time as this compilation). I would have also liked to see the song \\"You know what I mean\\" included which is one of his finest moments.    Aside from these drawbacks, there are some positives to this compilation. It is a good opportunity to obtain his contributions to movies on one CD. These include \\"Two Hearts\\", \\"Groovy kind of love\\" and \\"Separate lives\\". Another bonus is the inclusion of the duet\\"Easy lover\\" which was originally only available on Philip Bailey's album \\"Chinese Wall\\".    I look forward to a more comprehensive compilation one day of Phil's work.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|of adaptations from Stephen King's written work.  While there are a few differences....for instance, the ending is much, much different....for the most part this is what he wrote brought to screen.<br /><br />For the record, I actually think the ending of the movie was much better than that one in the story...more dramatic and jaw dropping....heart wrenching.  Whereas, in the story you are left hanging and don't have a clue if the main characters live or die.<br /><br />I am a life long Stephen King fan and there have been some of his movies I've loved, and some I've not liked at all because they weren't true to the story.  If you are the same, this one will not fail you.

B000TSIK14|5.0|This is an outstanding album from the Scorpions. How good is it to have a new set of brilliant songs from a band that has been around for a very long time that blows away the competition! This album has all the boxes ticked: great songs, great lyrics, great production, and great album flow. The teaming of the Scorpions with Desmond Child was always going to be an exciting prospect but they have really worked well together to make this excellent album a modern classic. I am definitely one very satisfied customer! I hope other bands try to use this project as an example of what is possible when care is taken with all aspects of an album.
0812975219|4.0|Fooled by Randomness is both a very interesting book, and a not very well organized one. It is constructed in an almost random (ha!) manner, leaping from one subject to another and never landing on any of its many ideas for very long. The basic concept of the book (and of Taleb's work in general) can be laid out in a single sentence - We underestimate the role of chance in our lives. His explanation for why we underestimate it, and how that under estimation affects our lives is what makes up the majority of the book, and it's a pretty fun (if disjointed) ride.    Taleb made his mark originally as a trader, and that is where many of his examples of the power of randomness come from. He uses finance to explain a survivor bias* and that we post hoc create narratives* to explain our success and failures, when really blind luck probably played a big role in getting us into or out of a given position. If you're involved in a risk prone trade, or just want to read some light, but smart nonfiction, this one is worth picking up.     *Meaning that we think if we want to get rich we should become entrepreneurs, because we only see the successful entrepreneurs, when in reality, if we want the best odds of getting rich, we should become dentists.  ** I should have seen the bubble burst in the housing market and limited my position! It is so clear now! Etc, etc. (yes, yes I know everyone knew the housing marker was going to tank, but no one knew, precisely when)
B000AYELVA|4.0|As an adaptation, I think, this outing from Marvel's partnerships with Hollywood isn't quite as good as the first two Spiderman films.  Of course, the special effects are splendid (Storm calling up the weather, Magneto at work, his henchman Toad hopping about flourishing an incredible tongue, shapechanger Mystique, and Wolverine's claws, to name a few), and Patrick Stewart as Prof. Xavier was an inspired casting choice.  But there's a certain darkness to the movie that isn't just about Marvel angst (I would have preferred to see the costumes from the original comics rather than a generic uniform, for one thing).  What's more, the focus is less on the X-Men as a whole than on Wolverine (perhaps to be expected considering his fan base!) and Magneto.  And even without being able to read Magneto's mind, it seems that a genius like Xavier, with the advantage of his long acquaintance with Magneto, would at least entertain the possibility that it's Rogue, not Wolverine, that he wants.  (Wolvie, after all, has apparently been out and about for a while before we meet him by way of Rogue, the newly-fledged Mississipian mutant who has run away from home in terror of what her powers do to people.)  On the other hand, Magneto is a villain with whom one can almost sympathize (especially considering that we learn early on that he survived the Nazi Holocaust and therefore fears that mutants may be the target of another such program--or should that be pogrom?).  I'm hoping that the subsequent chapters will give Cyclops, Jean Gray, and Storm more chance to shine.  On balance, though, it's a well-done action movie with a strong underlying message, and could well serve as a springboard for some good family discussions.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|Attractive actors, sets, costumes and a great score, but outside of those elements a veritable disappointment!  The film does not portray the characters in a way that is consistent with Austen's own depiction.  Anne is whiny and timid.  Wentworth is inarticulate and, at one point, actually confused to find that he has been flirting with Luisa Musgrove.  The Crofts, sensible and smart in other versions, are similarly confused and bland in this one.   Austen would never have countenanced a heroine of hers running a marathon around Bath because she can't master her feelings or a pround hero who gives in so easily. . .she might enjoy certain scenes and scenery in the movie but she would not have recognized this film as her own story.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Across the Universe is another film triumph by director Julie Taymor.  Incorporating theatre with film has always been her specialty and this movie is no exception.  The movie portrays a complicated love story buried in 1960's pop culture metaphors.  (Look for Bob Dylan and Janice Joplin and Jimi Hendrix and Joni Mitchell... it's all in the story.)    The visuals are stunning and Miss Taymor's trademark puppets even show up in a circus with Mr. Kite.    There is no question that this movie hides layers of different stories molded by one of the masters.  Watch it again and again.  And truly appreciate the beauty of the recreation of The Beatles music.

La seleccion de canciones es de primera.<br />La calidad de su presentacion es excelente.<br />Es un buen disco para tener.<br />Yo me esperaba alguna sorpresa, alguna canci&oacute;n especial, o alg&uacute;n bonus en el disco pero no.<br />De todos modos estoy muy contento de haberlo comprado.
0321544080|5.0|This one of the few photography books that I took out of the package, flipped through, sat down and read it from cover to cover.  It's like \\"Breaking the Magician's Code\\" only in book form for photographers.<br /><br />TMIC is organized with two page spreads for each \\"tip.\\" On one page (usually the right side) is a brilliant photo. On the opposite page is a story, memory or piece of advice.  For emphasis, a succinct quote from the narrative that summarizes the tip is placed on the page as well.  Many times there is a section, \\"How to Get This Type of Shot,\\" that explains how he got the effect in the photograph displayed.<br /><br />I am impressed with the \\"humanness\\" of the book.  It doesn't talk down to you. If there is photographic jargon in the story that might be confusing, he will put in a footnote to explain it.  He also includes a glossary and an index, bless his little cotton socks.<br /><br />This is a book I could give to a friend who doesn't care a whit about the rudiments of photography, as well as to my obsessive photographer friends.  It has a place on my bookshelf where I put books that I thumb through all the time.
B000W4HFY8|5.0|This is an amazing soundtrack. I got it the other day when we had a massive thunderstorm roll through town and listening to it with the sound of the rain pattering outside just added to the experience. it's not all from season two either! There's a few from season one mixed in for good measure.    Shelly and Audry's Prayer are my favorites.    And how about that hidden track? Has anyone been able to decipher it yet? I can make out a few words but that's all. Kinda creepy!
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This is as close to the original release as we are likely to get.  Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about (possible amazon mixed some reviews?)<br />This version which includes the original score not the controversial Moroder  re-score/edit.<br /><br />Excellent movie and the best transfer so far.
B000YA82F6|5.0|Ellen Page does a superb job as the irreverent, wisecracking sixteen-year old Juno who gets pregnant in high school and decides to go to term with her pregnancy and then put the baby up for adoption. The baby's father is a nerdy nerd, a track team member, a nice, sincere kid. Juno's small town seems to be obsessed with the high school track team because as a back drop to the action, track members are constantly jogging through the town like a chorus in a Greek tragedy except they don't comment on anything but underline the fact that this in a normal American town. The script is well written and the characters are well defined.<br /> The adoption couple are well-to-do yuppies. She is Mother Earth desperate to be a parent, and he is an American boy-man hung up on rock music, his guitar, and himself, stuck in an adolescent, emotionally arrested state of me-medom. He even fantasizes about making out with Juno while she kind of comes on to him.<br /> Juno's father played by J.K. Simmons is a little too sympathetic, heroic, and forgiving; he is so supportive and perfect as a father that you wish he'd develop some cracks in that platinum-plated persona. The stepmother has a sharp tongue, is tough but is practical, caring, and a good mother.<br /> It's a flick that will draw you into the story, make you care, and even draw forth some tears unless you're completely heartless. It's a small movie, but small movies like \\"Marty\\" are what really make movie viewing entertaining and enlightening because the small ones concentrate on character rather than car chases and mind-numbing action sequences.
B000FGGE68|5.0|This is a good movie with alot of action... The special effects are good and the acting is good... There are a few down points to the movie. But overall it was enjoyable and I didnt once turn it off...
B000VWYJ86|4.0|This is a good movie.  There is lots of action BUT not a movie for children to watch.
B00005JPUN|4.0|Okay, as someone who considers himself somewhat of a \\"Body Snatchers\\" afficianado, here is my opinion of the 4th version of Jack Finney's 1954 sci-fi novel (actually the 5th version, if you count the musical adaptation written for the stage...yes, this really exists!!!).<br /><br />Obviously, there is something about the \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" story that strikes a chord in the human psyche.  It consistantly makes producers want to re-invent it and audiences want to see it again.  Let's face it: the plot is full of holes and truly off-the-map logistically.  But who cares?  Not me.  The hook is its terrifying emotional impact, targeting our fears of being trapped in an apathetic, zombie-like society.  For my money, the best of the \\"Body Snatchers\\" is Phillip Kaufmann's 1978 rendition, which literally drips with atmospheric dread and paranoia.  It brings Don Siegel's 1955 version (which capitalized on McCarthyism and the Red Scare) crashing into a new era of psychoanalysis and the search for happiness.<br /><br />Abel Ferrara's 1993 re-make has its moments (interestingly, it's set in a military base).  However, all-in-all, the script feels undeveloped and the movie never reaches the full potential of either the original book or its two cinematic predecessors.<br /><br />So where does this leave \\"The Invasion\\" in the ranks?  In my opinion, not only is it not nearly as bad as people say it is, I'm going to go out on a limb and call it pretty darn good.  When a friend and I decided to see it in the theater despite the bad press, we turned to one another halfway through, surprised by the all the bad buzz.  True, the ending sucks, and I missed the pods from another world, however implausable they may have been.  But there are quite a few jolting scares, and some weird originality added: the creepy guy at the door taking a survey in the middle of the night, the viscious dog attack, deformed bodies slithering across the floor, and of course, all that unexpected projectile vomitting!  Also, rather than being replaced by pod people, the victims of \\"The Invasion\\" actually remain themselves, only drastically altered by an extraterrestrial virus.  This finally makes sense of the lines uttered by all the body snatchers in all the films, that the victims will still remain who they are, only greatly improved after being taken over.  Previously, this had always seemed like a pathetic selling point to get the victims to calm down, since it was obvious they were not going to continue in their current state, but be completely replicated, as their original forms  disintegrated.<br /><br />So there's my take on \\"The Invasion\\". Hey, why not read the original book, along with \\"They're Here...! A Tribute The Body Snatchers\\"?  Then you can rent all of the movie versions, and have a \\"Body Snatchers\\" weekend . . . while you wait for the next adaptation to come out.rather than being replaced by pod people, the victims of \\"The Invasion\\" actually remain themselves, only drastically altered by an extraterrestrial virus.

B00003CXIY|5.0|Road Trip is just that - a wonderfully complex adventure, a road trip shared between four college dorm-mates where incredible hijinks and comedy occurs from beginning to end.<br /><br />Josh (Breckin Meyer) is a student at the University of Ithaca (NY), and has been sending tapes to his girlfriend of many years.  They've been sappy, with bad singing and lame poetry.  Unfortunately for his girlfriend Tiffany, who attends college in Texas, she had a death in the family and went incognito for a few days.  Josh began to doubt their relationship, and took the opporunity to bed Beth (Amy Smart), a cute co-ed who is infatuated with Josh.  In a case of incredibly bad and good luck, Beth decides to film the session, but Josh accidentally sends the tape to Tiffany.  What follows is a race to beat the tape, save the relationship, and avoid humiliation.<br /><br />Along with his roommate Ruben (Paulo Costanzo), his friend EL (S. W. Scott), and a nerd (DJ Qualls) whose car they need for the trip, they start the journey from New York to Texas.  On the way, a car explodes during a Dukes of Hazzard reenactment, a midget and a nerd are in a step show, a Klan hood shows up, a sperm donor situation takes an unexpected turn, someone steals a bus from a blind school, a snake named Mitch makes a mistake during feeding time, and a dog demands blueberry pancakes.<br /><br />The only downfall to this movie is Tom Green's moronic schtick; it almost kills the movie.  He's the human speedbump in a highway of laughs.  Otherwise, it's a laugh riot nearly the entire movie.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This movie should be rated in the top 5 westerns of all time. Its unfortunate that many movie buffs have no idea about this movie. Reason: Its not from your Hollywood director, but from a guy in Italy who I think is the best when it came to the westerns. Sergio Leone may have been labeled making  'Spagetti Westerns', but in my opinion he made the 'real westerns'. Without  indulging too much into the story, I would ask the viewer to enjoy the locations, the great camera work and quirky/wonderful score by Ennio marricone, great story and great direction by Sergeo Leone.     The DVD does total justice. Own it if can.
0066620996|5.0|I recently finished reading the book Good To Great by Jim Collins.  I've read countless business books, full of prescriptions for greatness.  Most of these book contain interviews with CEO's from the Fortune 500 companies.  They talk about leadership and management styles.  It's rare to come across a book like Good To Great.  What makes it different?<br /><br />The author captures your attention right off the bat when he writes: \\"Good is the enemy of great.\\"  If you are good at what you do, don't you think that's enough?  Don't you think you are destined for greatness?  Through careful research the author and his team answer with a resounding No!  Being good just isn't good enough.<br /><br />So what is good enough?  Collins draws a picture of greatness by tracing the development of eleven companies that have not only become great over time but have also sustained greatness.<br /><br />The research began with a careful analysis of what defined greatness and sustained greatness.  Then once the team identified the 11 great companies, a similar number of comparison companies were identified. What went right in the good to great companies and what went wrong in the comparison companies?<br /><br />The book teaches us about something called Level 5 leadership.  I won't spoil his story by telling you all about the levels of leadership, but I will say that a Level 5 leader is rare. Why?  Because Level 5 leaders have a strange mixture of humility and tenacity.  It is the humility that creates the rarity.<br /><br />Collins goes on to say that great companies begin with the who and then decide on the what.  They bring together the best team they can and then decide where they are going.  Imagine the risk someone has to take to join a group and not know where it's going.  If you don't have the courage to do that, you can get off the bus.<br /><br />Not only is his book fascinating but it is also well-written.  You will begin to see what greatness is and what it takes whether you are a business, an entrepreneur, a solo practitioner, an artist or a nonprofit.<br /><br />The point of coaching is to empower people to greatness. It's to help them shed the complacency of being just good.  I tell my clients they can become better than the best.  The notion of continuous improvement flows as an undercurrent in Collins's book. No company, no matter how good, no matter how great, can relax.  With success comes the challenge of the next win.<br /><br />As an author and coach myself (see [[ASIN:1567203582 Strategic Interviewing: Skills and Tactics for Savvy Executives]], I recommend this book without hesitation.  Thank you, Jim Collins, for giving us this gem in the sea of business books.actitioner, an artist or a nonprofit.     The point of coaching is to empower people to greatness.

B000002KOO|5.0|I've been listening to this one on my iPod since I got it and have no intention of taking it out of rotation. This is dynamic--it would be great with the inclusion of \\"Oh Well\\" alone. It's a real pity that the Buckingham/Nicks era of Fleetwood Mac has all but buried the fine accomplishments of Peter Green and Danny Kirwan. \\"Then Play On\\" is every bit as sophisticated and adventurous as \\"Rumours\\", just a lot more blues-based. Check out \\"Hollywood Blues\\" for example. Or \\"My Dream\\" for something more gentle. This album also shows off the prowress of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie; no holding back here! The one questionable element is Jeremy Spencer--is he present? (Some reviewers say he is not, but I'm not sure). Still, this should be an essential part of any collection. As far as the quality of the transfer--it doesn't sound that bad to me, but maybe that's something to be left to the audio experts. If there's a better version out there, great, but get a copy somehow. A worthwhile investment.
B0012HCASA|4.0|Mark me down as a fan. I look forward to every new episode. The mother's character grows a bit tiresome to me, but I love the female android (from FIREFLY and THE 4400), that she alone is reason enough to watch it. I'd love this show even more if they did more time jumping.
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is truly a classic movie filled with all the charm and sincerity you would want in a Christmas movie.  A feel good movie, which is in short supply these days.  I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|\\"The Pursuit Of Happyness\\" is an emotionally enriching cinematic experience.  It's basically a tribute to the pursuing one's dreams despite the obstacles that are thrown in front of you and perservering in the end.  Will Smith's Chris Gardner is an industrious chap with a lot of charm and savvy but suffers from a little misdirection.  He begins the film peddling around San Francisco doctor's offices bone density scanners.  This venture doesn't make him rich so he soon sets his goal on an internship with Dean Witter for a one-in-twenty shot at being a stockbroker.  There are many pitfalls to attaining his dream.  His wife recently left him with a five year old son to fend for.  The internship is unpaid.  He's evicted from a number of domiciles and at times forced to live in shelters and public bathrooms.  Racism isn't really cited as a reason for Chris' predicament but there are subtle hints like when Dean Witter's instructor forces Chris to park his car.  Despite it all Chris never wavers from his determination.  Credit Will Smith for giving a full-bodied portrait of a man who wants his piece of the American Pie.  Not to give anything away, the look on the face of Chris as he meets with the Dean Witter executives toward the films end will bring out the tear ducts.  Jaden Smith, Will's real life son and his son in the film, gives a naturally charming and unaffected performance.  \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" should soon be a bona fide word-of-mouth classic.
0735619670|5.0|This is an excellent resource for any one who wants to go past simply writing code.  Managers from a non software background who are put in charge of software teams would do well in reading this as it gives a very thorough description of what good software is all about.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|In a time when large scale epics were commonplace, \\"El Cid\\" stands out from the rest of the pack.  Maybe because it was made apart from the major studios that it lacks the sheen but is no less polished.  Also, director Anthony Mann, who cut his teeth on psychological Westerns, pays as much attention to characterization but doesn't skimp on the spectacle.  Credit too has to go to Charlton Heston who is old hat at carrying these large scale epics.  Heston's Cid, after Ben-Hur, has to be my favorite performance by him.  Heston never gets credit for his formidable acting skills, probably dismissed because of his right-wing politics.  Note:  Will somebody please re-issue \\"The Warlord\\" on DVD.  Sophia Loren as the film's romantic interest is equally glamorous and shows herself to be an adept actress.  Throw in a classic Miklos Rosza score and you have a film that is indispensible.  Marty Scorsese is right in proclaiming \\"El Cid\\" as one of filmdoms great epics.  Bring on \\"The Fall of the Roman Empire\\"(coming in April).
B00004WNNP|4.0|i'd have to say that this is a great album. many people don't like the massive 80's production, but the way it was produced still has a distinct style to it. i can't say it's a floyd style because it's so different from past albums. i'd say it's a great album but not one to listen to all the time over and over. signs of life is a nice little intro that leads into my favorite song on the album, learning to fly, which is a nice well written and structured song. the dogs of war is one of my floyd favorites as well. a new machine and terminal frost are also very good, they definatly have some of that good old floyd style to them. Sorrow i actually don't like all that much. but overall, i'd say it's a pretty good album.
B000XUOIQ4|3.0|The cat movie to 101 Dalmatian's dog story, The Aristocats is a fun and cute movie about a family of lost cats finding their way home. They encounter lots of eccentric animals along the way, from fellow cats to a pair of English geese on holiday.    Unfortunately the cats did not get the Platinum Edition treatment all the more popular classics have been getting. The picture is grainy and sometimes oddly sketchy. There's no second disk of delicious extras to pour through either, just the bear minimum.
B000MV8AE0|4.0|I loved the music. Wish there was more.    The story itself is apparently not very accurate which I think in retrospect is annoying. Also nothing really grabbed me in the story. Also not knowing much about music, I wish they had better explained what a copyist does.     I thought the acting was good. The characters in their own way were interesting. I particularly liked Beethoven.     The filming I thought was good.

B000B8QF00|2.0|Even if this just a `collection' as the title suggests, everything remotely interesting that was released by Morissette has been omitted in favor of the regular suspects from \\"Jagged Little Pill\\". Why? How could Alanis have thought that this was the collection that fans would want? It leaves out her best tracks, some important singles, and the `rare' additions to the CD are ultimately pointless and useless. Even if you're new to Alanis, this is a horrible place to start. No wonder it hasn't sold much over the years. Someone please inform Alanis' record label on how to really go about releasing a Greatest Hits album.<br /><br />First of all, what is possibly one of Alanis' greatest songs - \\"So Pure\\" - is completely left out of this collection. Secondly, why the poor-sister treatment of her album \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\"? True lovers of Morissette's music will know that SFIJ was her best album by far. The songs on that album are monumental in my life even more than a decade since its' release. Such amazing gems - \\"Would Not Come\\", \\"UR\\", \\"Heart of the House\\", and \\"Joining You\\" - and none of them feature on this album!<br /><br />Instead we get the usual singles from JLP - \\"You Oughta Know\\" (this is essential though - I do understand), \\"Head Over Feet\\" (I would have preferred \\"Right Through You\\"), and \\"Hand in my Pocket\\". But they leave out one of the best singles on JLP - \\"All I Really Want\\". It makes no sense.<br /><br />The record labels' idea of giving the fans what they want, are somewhat realized with the inclusion of some rarities. The best amongst these are the breathless big-band version of \\"Lets Fall in Love\\" from the De-Lovely Soundtrack. I had heard this before, but the last minute of this song was painful to listen to it, as even Alanis seemed to be lost on how to sing this to the very final note. \\"Mercy\\" from the rare album \\"The Prayer Cycle\\" is indeed a welcome addition for new fans, but really, this song has very little Alanis, who is reduced to some background warbling here (and she sounded way too screechy on this song to be considered spiritual in any way or form). Primarily, its sung by a male vocalist, so this is not an Alanis track per se.<br /><br />\\"Still\\" from the Dogma soundtrack is appreciated, but there is absolutely no excuse from not adding on one of Alanis' Top 5 of All Time songs here - \\"Precious Illusions\\" from \\"Under Rug Swept\\". There is also no \\"Utopia\\", but at least they added \\"Uninvited\\" from the City of Angels soundtrack.<br /><br />And what about the two actual best tracks from JLP - \\"Wake Up\\" and \\"Not the Doctor\\". Certainly either one of them are better than \\"Head over Feet\\"?<br /><br />Heres the thing - granted that \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" was Alanis' most popular album, but I think they should have collected some decent tracks from \\"Under Rug Swept\\" for this as well. Alanis has an incredible body of work behind her, and she deserves a 2-CD retrospective, if they're going to get it right. First, I would appreciate it if they started paying \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" the respect it deserves, and elevate \\"So Pure\\" to the classic status it requires. Also, this collection leaves out \\"Unsent\\" - a cult Morissette favorite.<br /><br />\\"The Collection\\" is a pathetic assortment of Alanis tracks. Even with the `rare' tracks added on, it seems very poorly thought-out and not at all coherent. The song sequencing is terrible. The album begins with \\"Thank U\\" - a great song, but a really weak opener to the album. New listeners might actually fall asleep watching for the album to pick up momentum. The album ends with the now-jaded \\"Hand in my Pocket\\", which is a very poor way to close any Alanis album. For new fans of Alanis, make your own Alanis collection from the songs I've mentioned here instead.<br /><br />Skip this tepid release, and lets wait for the day they decide to put out an actual collection of Alanis' best work. For both fans and new listeners, this CD is an exercise in pointlessness.<br /><br />Two Stars.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I ordered this movie and this was an AMAZING box set. I love it. Good price for GREAT movies. It's all 4, PLUS A BONUS DISC. NOTHING CAN BEAT THAT. ANY ALIEN FAN NEEDS TO BUY THIS!!!
B000VAHR00|3.0|What's not to like about this film? Well...most of the costumes are straight out of one of the lesser Original Star Trek eps. The miniatures are on a level with the better Tom Baker Dr. Whos. Most of the bit players,especially the guy playing the Cub leader,are embarrassingly bad.  Roscoe Lee Browne barely conceals his shame at playing the giant vacuum cleaner robot that threatens to tip over any second. Farrah Fawcett is utterly appalling.(By the way, Lindsay Wagner was almost cast as Jessica,according to the commentary...now that would have made this a true 1970s collectors classic, seeing The Bionic Woman tussle with the head Charlie's Angel...) There are numerous plot stupidities(for example, Jessica gets teleported into Logan's apartment, but then later angrily WALKS out...hope she lived close by, or had bus fare stashed somewhere...)So why do I like this thing? Because nostalgia is quality blind. I was 6 years old when it was released, and it seemed to me that it was the coolest science fiction film ever. I read the Marvel Comics adaptation, I couldn't wait for it to get on TV. I even sat through the appalling TV series that followed...and then Star Wars arrived the next year and this was consigned to the science fiction wastebasket. Ah, well. To be six again...
B00012FXB8|3.0|The first and second aliens were AMAZING but this one was only okay. I thought that the new looking alien was cool but I did not like the writing and acting quite as much...very predictable as well. Other than that...I liked this movie. I suggest Alien and Aliens instead though.
B0010X745K|5.0|I really take my hat off to Stephen King for coming up with the thrilling story about a bunch of townfolks battling with some blood-thirsty monsters coming out of a myserious mist engulfing a supermarket in the movie, 'The Mist'.<br /><br />To me, he is indisputably a great suspense maestro.<br /><br />[I had enjoyed watching many of Stephen King's earlier masterpieces, including 'Carrie', 'Pet Semantary', 'The Sleepwalkers', 'The Thing', & 'The Fog'. In fact, 'The Mist' bore some resemblance to 'The Fog'.]<br /><br />Yesterday evening, my gym buddy asked me about what movie we could go & watch, & I told him that the only one I thought worthwhile would only be 'The Mist', after going through all the newspaper ads.<br /><br />The movie had both of us glued tightly to the edge of our seats for some two solid hours in the movie theatre at the Jurong Entertainment Centre. My buddy was so excited that he even ignored the call of nature till the very last minute of the movie's ending, when he had to rush to the gent's for a quick leak.<br /><br />The movie started off with a freak thunderstorm overnight. Our hero, probably an artist (played by Thomas Jane, whom I last saw as FBI agent turned vigilante, Frank Castle, in the action movie, 'The Punisher'), his wife & young kid saw their home, located in the vicinity of a beautiful lake, badly damaged on the next morning.<br /><br />There was an uprooted tree. Another fallen tree had crashed into a boat quay at the lake. In the far distance across the lake horizon, they saw a seemingly vast, but definitely unusual, mist looming on the lake surface.<br /><br />Together with their neighbour, whose Mercedes convertible was badly smashed up by an uprooted tree, our hero & his young kid went into town to pick up some emergency supplies. The wife was left behind.<br /><br />As they drove towards the town, they saw a convoy of military, fire-fighting & police vehicles rushing to go somewhere.<br /><br />As I listened to their casual conversation in the car, which turned to strange cues like 'nearby military base', 'Project Arrowhead', 'missile defence research', 'crashed flying saucer with frozen alien bodies', then I knew the movie was going to be really fun & exciting, even though I did not understand what it was all about.<br /><br />At the supermarket, a lot of townfolks was busy gathering their purchases.<br /><br />Three army soldiers then walked quietly into the supermarket, followed by a military policeman in close pursuit. They huddled at one corner, while I overheard the policeman telling the soldiers that their leave was cancelled & they had to return to base.<br /><br />In the next scene, an elderly man with a bloody nose & blood on his clothes rushed into the supermarket & yelled that something in the mist had grabbed his pal. He urged the staff to close the main door quickly.<br /><br />Outside the supermarket, the mysterious mist had thickened further & gradually engulfing the entire building.<br /><br />The building then started to shake violently in the next few scenes, with most of the ceiling panels & fluorescent lamps flying around.<br /><br />Next, the now frightened & bewildered townfolks trapped inside the supermarket realised that something was not right. The staff rushed to close the main door.<br /><br />I must say, the movie director certainly knew his craft very well, as he took his own sweet time to build up visually the suspense all the way from the beginning segment of the movie.<br /><br />Our hero meanwhile wandered into the generator room at the back of the supermarket. It was dark & he bumped his head. He heard something hitting the roller shutters at the rear loading dock. To him, he definitely sensed that there was something quite sinister out there.<br /><br />The next few scenes were some of the most pulsating action sequences of the movie. Gory & nauseating, too! That's why the movie was rated NC-16.<br /><br />Well, to all readers out there, I reckon you just have to go & watch this suspenseful movie to catch the remaining exciting plot, with all kinds of fiery monsters, big ones, small ones & even tiny ones, creating havoc inside the supermarket & nearby pharmacy.<br /><br />Worst of all, in all the confusion, there was this mad lady, holding a bible, talking about the end of days. Not too long later, her message began to affect some of the badly shaken townfolks, who then started to turn against each other. To me, they, the believers, were deadlier than all those crazy monsters coming out of the mist.<br /><br />Somewhere towards the middle of the movie, I began to put some pieces of the puzzle together, when the military policeman we saw earlier was found half-dead in some sort of a silky cocoon in the nearby pharmacy. Before he died, with thousands of small spiders crawling out of his physical body, he uttered some thing to the effect that the army had screwed up something that had created the diabolical mess in the town.<br /><br />Two of the three soldiers we saw earlier had also committed suicide at the back of the supermarket. The remaining solder was finally cornered & killed by the believers, & his body was thrown out of the main door, in an attempt to appease whoever or whatever was out there.<br /><br />It seemed that the army had unwittingly discovered a 'window' to another dimension, which those alien creatures had used to enter our world.<br /><br />Frankly, I did not like the ending part, although I was intrigued by the six-legged behemoth still lurking happily in the background. Somewhat shocking & unexpected, to say the least.<br /><br />Maybe, there's some kind of a message to all of us as human beings. Maybe, there's something else. Well, I reckon it serves as food for thought.<br /><br />In the end analysis, I must say that the cinematography involving all the seemingly out-of-this-world monsters - sliding, crawling, straddling, flying; some had squid-like tentacles, some even spitted acidic fumes, but all had one thing in common - they loved human blood! - inside & outside the supermarket was the best I have ever seen in recent months.<br /><br />I have truly enjoyed watching 'The Mist'.

B00012FXAE|4.0|Not quite as good as the first one, but still a great movie. Way better than the movies that come out today. :)
1595141715|5.0|I just finished this -- and I am telling you it was compelling.  It should be required reading by anyone in high school or middle school -- or anyone who has a child in high school or middle school.  Basically it tells of Clay Jensen, a high school student who receives a box of audiotapes narrated by a girl who he had a crush on, Hannah Baker, who has recently committed suicide.  The book interweaves her words from the audiotapes with his comments and memories.  It gives Hannah's reasons why she did what she did and names the people (who also are receiving audiotapes - each person is to mail them to the next person on the list) and why they contributed to what happened.  It may have been something big, somewhat small, something seemingly innocent, something no so much.  But it all leads up to Hannah not being able to cope by herself even when she reaches out for help.  If anyone can read this and see themselves in it and make changes - or even better see someone else and reach out in compassion, this book will have a huge effect.
B000056VJ7|5.0|First, I need to say that this is one of my favourite albums ever. I am proud that my Mum bought it on vinal for my Dad when it was released, thus contributing to it's initial popularity.    Secondly, the reason for the title: I just read the one star reviews. It would seem that a bunch of people couldn't resist wearing their pretensions on their sleeves and bashing this gem without realising how foolish they appear. I especially loved \\"it is claptrap like this that remind us just what it was that punk was (thankfully) rebelling against in the first place\\". Now, I have nothing against punk, in fact I love it. Punk tore up the complacent atmosphere that had grown up around glam rock and allowed rock and roll to thrive again. Or rather, good punk did. Punk also allowed talentless fools who were better at gobbing on their fans than playing their guitars to gain fame by clinging to the coattails of the genuine talent. These 'punks' (and some of the talented ones as well) had a sickening tendancy to take themselves seriously. Disgustingly seriously. I find it immensely gratifying to think of Meatloaf mocking their pseudoanarchy by creating the most unpunk, overblown, theatrical piece of music I have ever heard. The people who dismiss it as pretentious miss the humour with which it was made and performed.
6305291446|5.0|I love Halloween. No other horror movie holds my favor like this one does. I saw the original when I was about 8-9 may be a little older perhaps 10-11, but I never forgot that white mask or the eerie music cue that signaled The Shape was close by. Towards the end of the 90's I found out there was going to be another Halloween movie released (not knowing there were about 6 other films out there, I assumed this was the sequel at the time). H20 automatically became a favorite after I saw it in the theater, and now at long last I own the DVD (which makes me extremely happy). I had forgotten all about this movie which I consider as I think most/some of the fans do THE END of the Halloween story. I've always counted this as the final chapter since it had a pretty clear cut ending if you'll forgive the pun and even though I don't like to see that certain someone die, I thought this was the right way to go with it. This film is one of the \\"must see\\" ones for any fan of Halloween, I highly recommend it!<br /><br />PS: I did see Ressurection: Didn't care for it all that much but it made me laugh and it kept me entertained for about an hour or however long it was. I also saw Rob's remake: I loved it. Yes, I said I LOVED IT and it's now in my Halloween Collection.
B00000IBRI|3.0|Dario Argento is one of the most well known masters of horror, and until recently I had never even heard of him.<br /><br />  I saw Suspiria and I found it visually stunning and extremely over-the-top...I especially loved that Dario's heroine in Suspiria was inspired by Snow White...I could clearly see that vision and found it really interesting!<br /><br />  Unfortunatly, THIS Argento film was just a little too odd for my taste.<br /><br />  Jennifer Connelly (one of my personal heroes for starring in Labyrinth!) stars as (ironically) Jennifer, A Fourteen year old girl with a weird affinity for insects.<br /><br />  We are introduced to Jennifer on her way to a Swiss all girls school. There is a killer on the loose slaughtering the students, and Jennifer finds herself alienated and unpopular; especially after they discover her love for bugs.<br /><br /> Donald Pleasance, who is most well known for his role as Dr.Loomis in the Halloween series, plays a wheel-chair bound Entimologist with a helpful pet chimp named Inga.<br />  Honestly, Inga was my favorite character in the movie. Best acting, hands down. But, then again, I have a weird love for monkees and all things chimps, so maybe i am just biased.<br /><br />  Jennifer Connelly was lovely to look at, but her acting was underdeveloped and hard to stomach at times. Seriously, one second she would be screaming for help and crying, the next second she would be peaceful looking and happy, then BAM!, back to screaming and terrified. It was unsettling.<br /><br /> Another strange thing I have noticed about Dario films, is that his murder victims are rarely introduced or talked about. One second we are watching a girl walk around, the next she is being killed. No names or backstory to the character. It's really strange. I personally would like a little more character info before someone gets wacked. It would lead to the tension a little more.<br /><br />  The death scenes are horrific as always since Dario likes his gore, but they aren't too extreme. It seems Dario has a love for his victims smashing through glass windows, since it occurred in Suspiria and also in the first murder scene of this film. I did find it kind of annoying that we are almost INSTANTLY aware that our killer is either A.) A midget, B.) An Animal, or C.) Something supernatural that is small of stature....since the first victim was staring DOWN at it as it chased her.<br /><br />  Another slightly irksome issue I had with this film was the heavy metal score at certain moments throughout the movie. It was WAY, WAY too attention diverting and loud. Goblin (Dario's standard horror score creators) should have stuck with the typical, synthisized, moody orchestrations that add more drama to the scenes. I thought the non-heavy metal moments were totally fine.<br /><br />  Overall, I think that with better actors and more enhanced characters, this movie could have been a true gem. I am giving it 3 stars for originality, the fact that Jennifer Connelly was in it with disgusting bugs covering her, and the AWESOME monkey that saves the day.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|\\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" remains among the most pleasurable moviegoing experiences. Everything works beautifully in this lavish Technicolor adventure: Michael Curtiz and William Keighley's seamless direction; Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Oscar-winning score; and a legendary cast. In addition to the film's stunning restoration, the DVD set offers a treasure trove of extras. However, it wouldn't hurt Warner Bros. to reissue this 1938 swashbuckler on the big screen - where the inspired chemistry between Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland shines best.
B000005H4K|3.0|I'm not entirely sure what to make of this album. Ellington's compositions are brilliant as always, and his playing is deliciously tasteful while managing at the same time to be intriguingly left of center. Max Roach's drumming is powerful and funky, proving once again that nobody swings harder.  The one that really disappointed me was Mingus, which is tragic because he is among my absolute favorite musicians. His tone is harsh and trebly, which isn't helped by the odd riffs and fills he plays that sound more like rasping sound effects than a harmonic foundation.  The whole recording just sounds slightly off. The rhythms never lock up. The improvisations go to interesting places, but they do so without the professionalism that should be expected of such top-notch performers.
0553805460|5.0|Read this book if only for entertainment reasons.  No, you won't learn anything useful, but the account of this guy's life is extraordinary and the negative reviews seem to all be from very easily offended people who are obviously so digusted by this guy that they want to see him go down in flames (again).  It's not meant to be an apology - just an account.  Keep that in mind as you read it, and DO read it.    ps It seems this book is polarising - people either love it or hate it.  Like Hillary Clinton!    pps I actually would love to meet Jordan Belfort to see if he's really this larger than life character for real
0143038419|1.0|This book implies that it takes a great deal of money to find God and love. Ms. Gilbert's self deprecating humor is slickly described with pop references and descriptors and doesn't feel authentic -- more like the rehearsings of one who knows there is a paycheck and has never scratched and hungered.  One wonders if Ms. Gilbert is capable of truly feeling deeply or can only pretend to feel deeply. Quite disappointing.
B0012BTBQU|5.0|I found this book to be fabulous!  It moved along well, no slow parts, plenty of unexpected twists, action, etc.  Just when you think you might be able to guess where the plot is going, it takes two steps to the left.  Many fantasy books read like every other fantasy book out there, but this one is unique and fresh.

B000XUOIQ4|4.0|Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (Hermione Baddeley) is a wealthy former actress living in Paris in 1910.  Since she has no family, she has come to view her cat Dutchess (Eva Gabor) and her kittens as her family.  In fact, she has decided to leave her wealth to the cats as long as they live, then it will go to her butler Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby).<br /><br />Edgar doesn't like the idea of having to wait, however, so he schemes to catnap the cats.  After mixing sleeping pills into their favorite treat, he takes them into the country.<br /><br />The cats aren't so easily gotten rid of, however.  Teaming up with Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), they set out to return to Paris.  Will they make it?  What will Edgar do if they show up again?<br /><br />This movie leans just slightly over average.  There are parts of the story that are rather dull, like the introduction of the twin ducks.  However, there are some wonderful bits as well, like the two country dogs to keep attacking Edgar.  This will appeal to kids more then adults, and they will love it.  While not all the songs are jazz, it certainly influenced the soundtrack.  And you've got to love \\"Everybody Wants to be a Cat,\\" the show stopping number that comes near the end.  The animation is more stylized then we've seen before, with flat backgrounds and pencil like lines in the characters.  It's definitely dated, but has a charm all its own.<br /><br />This movie just got a new Special Edition.  The widescreen picture and full surround are wonderful.  The special they are most proud of is the \\"virtual kitten\\" game.  I skipped right past that and went straight to the features about the movie.  The one I really enjoyed was the information about \\"She Never Felt Alone,\\" a song deleted from the movie.  I was hoping the featurette on the Sherman Brothers would be more about their entire career at Disney, but there are some fun tidbits about their work on this film.  And keep your eyes open for a bonus short that plenty of fun.<br /><br />On the whole, this is a light film with some fun moments.  It's probably not one the adults will pull out regularly, but it should keep the kids entertained with the funny action scenes.lm with some fun moments.

0803729227|5.0|We have several books by Julia Donaldson. Mostly they have been translated into Hebrew as we live in Israel and my kids are bilingual. But The Snail and the Whale is one of the few we have in English....and I'm so happy that we do! I love this story. I've read it to my kids so many times, I think I could recite it verbatim from start to finish - yet we never tire of it. Ms Donaldson has such a magical way with words that truly engages the kids and yet there's always a message in her books without ever sounding even remotely preachy. And true to form, the tiny snail in this story teaches us a great big lesson about bravery, self-worth and friendship.
0143038419|1.0|I remember the summer when everyone everywhere was reading Eco's \\"The Name of the Rose.\\" \\"Wow, people!\\" thought I--\\"you all rock!\\" I want to go back to that world, leaving behind the milleu that puts a book like \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" on the Times Best Sellers List.     Well, it's not all bad--it spawned incisive reviews here like C. Quinn's and R. Ernst's, which were both pleasures to read.  And after all, the book is a museum quality artifact of the self-absorbed personality. The funny thing is that Elizabeth Gilbert spills the beans up front about the advance book contract (and she constantly points out to us that she's obsessively self-centered). You can feel the churning out of the pages as you read them.    It might have been a spirit-freeing exercise for Ms Gilbert, who knew what she was really up to, if she had sought out a couple of promising young writers from, say, the MFA writing programs at Columbia and Iowa and given them her proceeds and royalties. The shaktipat would have blasted her free for life.
0375842209|5.0|Rarely a book comes along that stops me in my tracks almost from the first page. This is one of those books. Within a few short pages I knew this was going to be a book I'd want to keep reading for as long as I could stretch it out, not wanting it to come to an end. So I 'rationed' it's pages, each night allowing myself only a few. I wanted the trip with Liesel and Death to go on for months. Unfortunately my willpower wasn't as strong as that, but I managed to savor The Book Thief for several weeks, before sadly I had to say goodbye. I know. It sounds ridiculous - as if I'm speaking of a flesh and blood relationship. Yet this book is that good. I, like other reviewers, hadn't thought of it as a young adult book. I'm far past that stage myself, but I certainly can see that it would be a wonderful choice for a high school class to read and discuss...what a kick start to what could only become a lively and educational discussion! Bravo to Markus Zusak for creating such a brilliant story.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|\\"I Robot\\" was the 2nd album released by the Alan Parson Project (APP).  It came out in 1977, on the heels of \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination: Edgar Allen Poe\\".  \\"I Robot\\" is based only loosely on the the general concept of Asimov's \\"I, Robot\\" (as another reviewer has ably commented).<br /><br />This album is widely touted as being the epitome and, perhaps, the apex of APP's accomplishments in terms of a classic rock concept album.  If you listened to APP's 1st album (Tales of Mystery...) and you liked tracks such as \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" and \\"Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether\\" then are almost certainly going to LOVE this album.<br /><br />In some ways this is a harder-driving album than most of the APP efforts, since it has tracks like \\"I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You\\", \\"Breakdown\\", and \\"The Voice.\\"<br /><br />If, on the other hand, the tracks you enjoyed most from \\"Tales of Mystery...\\" were the more reflective ones, such as \\"To One in Paradise\\", don't despair, there is something here for you, too.  Check out \\"Some Other Time\\", \\"Don't Let It Show\\", and \\"Day After Day.\\"<br /><br />Finally, if you found yourself going back to the instrumental tracks on \\"Tales of Mystery...\\" then you will almost certainly enjoy \\"I Robot\\", \\"Total Eclipse\\", and \\"Genesis 1:32\\".<br /><br />The Album has great staying power.  As other reviewers have noted, even if they first came across this album years ago, it remains an active part of their listing experiences.  It has for me, too.  I bought the album (LP, actually) in 1977 when it came out, so I've listened to this album for over 30 years.  It's not getting old.<br /><br />Finally, one additional bit of info on this particular disc.  The original release of \\"I Robot\\" had 10 tracks.  This one has 15.  The value added tracks include background and early experimental or rough tracks for some of the other songs on the CD. If you are a serious APP fan, you may find yourself being tempted by those tracks alone!<br /><br />All in all, this is, easily a 5-star product.  And, I don't just run around giving everything 5 stars!  You and I know that there are lots and lots of non-5 star options out there.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are a long-time APP fan, there is something for you.  If you are just discovering APP, I recommend that you do it right, and listen to the APP albums in order, starting with \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" before you move on to this one.  Either way, though, you are in for a treat!<br /><br />Definitely 5 stars from a 30+ year APP listener...giving everything 5 stars!

B000002I57|5.0|I picked this up largely on the reviews out here on Amazon.  I was sort of skeptical as I am so partial to Trane's recordings with Elvin on drums.  I figured this would be good but wouldn't grab me like the stuff with his quartet.  But I liked Miles with Milt Jackson on Bag's Groove so I had a go.  This is really great stuff.  My favorite cuts are \\"Bags and Trane\\" and \\"Be-Bop\\"  The playing isn't way out there but it isn't as conservative as I thought it might be either.  If you are a Trane fan and like his Atlantic stuff then you will definitely like this.
B000VWYNOG|4.0|I'm happy to have it in my collection, but it's not \\"officially\\" a greatest hits album without some version of \\"Caravan\\", preferably the Last Waltz rendition.
B000000OU6|5.0|A pretty good hard rock album, and a nice first album for Slash.  \\"Neither Can I\\" starts off the album in a dark blues that's very appealing, and the bluesy feel carries through \\"Dime Store Rock\\" to album highlight \\"Beggars & Hangers-On.\\"  There are a lot of good tracks on this one, and a few misses as well, but it's mostly a strong album.  The songwriting is strong, if less than what it was in Guns N' Roses.  The instrumental work is strong throughout, and the vocals are generally good, though somewhat inconsistent at points.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this never got the play it deserved.  To boost sales, the record company insisted on putting adding Slash's name to the bands name \\"Snakepit,\\" turning the album from a cool new rock record to a side-project.  Side-projects can be good, but fans rarely get as invested in them as they should, and I personally would rather see fewer sales and greater, deeper fan appreciate for \\"Snakepit\\" than increased sales for \\"Slash's Snakepit.\\"  But, alas, I'm certain that the record companies would disagree.<br /><br />It's just a shame that this is less famous than Velvet Revolver, as much of the music is better than that band has produced.
B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|First off, don't immediately writer her off just because she is pretty.      That is discrimination too ! Her songs are nice love / heartbreak songs you expect a teen / young adult to sing. I especially love \\" Teardrops on my guitar \\", she really expresses the emotion of that song.    Taylor is a very good singer, and will become an even better singer. She wrote a couple of the songs herself, and co-wrote the rest. If you've seen Her videos, you know she also plays the guitar.    For those that don't usually listen to Country music, this is more of a Country-Pop album. Listen to the Amazon clips, its a great album !    This edition is the deluxe, so you get a DVD of video clips. Nice high quality full screen stuff.  Not those little ones from YouTube : )  You also get a few behind the scene videos / interviews. Great if you are a real fan.
B000002OX5|3.0|This album has a great concept, but lacks in the execution.  The songs lack the energy of earlier albums and the improved songwriting of later albums.  I know others like this album a great deal, but it strikes me as a very forgettable performance.
1853104825|5.0|I had read many accidents from books,via internet for my search about human factors.Fortunately,i had bought \\"The Naked Pilot\\". This book let me see my own mistakes in front of my mental mirror, as a fixed and rotary wing pilot. Although,the front cover depicts an A300 cockpit, i really think that all pilots(including lighter than air,glider pilots) should read the book. You probably do not have as many systems as B-747-400 or Tristar,but you are still human and fallible.I like to echo the title of my review again: Thank You Mr.David Beaty for conducting your knowledge and experience to us.
B000002IGV|4.0|An interesting piece of rock/metal history, with one of the most anthemic songs of all time in \\"We're Not Gonna Take It.\\"  But, as is often the case with songs that become as famous as that one did, it's eventually misused in ridiculous commercials and is lessened because of it.<br /><br />Yeah.  Thanks for that.<br /><br />Fortunately, the rest of the album stands up enough to distract me from this latest sacrilege, with highlights in \\"Burn in Hell,\\" \\"Captain Howdy,\\" of course the great rocker \\"I Wanna Rock,\\" and \\"The Price.\\"
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|Really enjoyed this movie but buy it on HD DVD if you have a choice. More features and bang for your buck. It will then play in your regular DVD player as well.
B000MGBRHC|4.0|Much like their first album, Volbeat's Rock the Rebel / Metal the Devil is at its best when evoking memories of oldies greats through a clever mix of oldies melodies and metal.  This album is more consistently strong than was the debut, and I still think that the approach is unique and interesting.  I just wish the songwriting across the entire album were a little stronger.
B000YA9R3C|5.0|There Will Be Blood is a tense, acerbic epic that has lingered in my subconscious for over a week now. Seeing the film for the first time left me with a familiar sense of awe that's inherent in the works of another brilliant film-auteur, Stanley Kubrick. There Will Be Blood spans the first three decades of the 21st century, focusing on an oilman's greed, misanthropy, and his son.     The film's story begins to gather steam, when Daniel Plainview and his young son, H.W., are given a tip about a town named Little Boston, where oil literally seeps to the top of the earth.  Plainview's ambition and greed are piqued by the information, sending all of his instruments to the area to capture the oil.  Once they reach the town, they are confronted by a charismatic, slippery young preacher, Eli Sunday.    It becomes apparent that Plainview is one to say and do whatever it takes to get what he wants. He works maniacally to reap the fruits of his labor, letting no distractions come in his way between himself and his quest for wealth.  His response to the surprises and plot twists of the film's second act expose the truth of his character, and forces the audience to confront the reality of this man.    Things reach a boiling point in the film's last act, when Plainview can no longer sustain the falsity that carries him through public. The film's last two scenes are two of the most heartbreaking and harrowing moments in film that I've seen in quite some time.    Part of the brilliance, and unsettling-nature of the film, is being unaware of what's coming next. The film moves with a deliberate, exact pace that's quite reminiscent of 2007's other instant-classic: No Country for Old Men. The difference with There Will Be Blood is the scope of the film, and the boundaries that are continually pushed.     The film touches on numerous subjects, including greed, family, religion, ambition, modern technology and consumerism, and obsession.  Its main character is not the type of person that you'd want encounter or do business with.  Yet, the character's so compelling and riveting that you can't turn away from the train wrecks that he precipitates.     Early buzz about the movie set the bar unnaturally high for Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as the oilman, Daniel Plainview. In a rare occasion, all the expectations are trumped. For the nearly two hours and forty minutes the actor's on the screen, he never takes a breath as anyone but Plainview. The highest compliment that can be extolled upon the actor is the fact that he makes a character like Plainview so viewable and memorable.      The other elements of the film are also top-notch in every aspect. Each actor gives an exceptional performance, especially Paul Dano and Brendan Fraiser. Dano believably goes toe-to-toe with Day-Lewis as Eli Sunday in the film's most squirm-inducing moments, including the incredible finale (which also includes an instant-classic of a quote). Fraiser plays Plainview's son with an incredibly stoic presence. I've never been one that particularly cared for child actors, but this kid has tremendous talent. It's a shame that I can't talk more about his performance and meaning to the film, for he's a key aspect to Plainview's character and the film's plot development.      One of the other standout features of the film is the score. It's an absolute travesty that the Academy ruled Jonny Greenwood's score ineligible for Oscar-contention. Greenwood (who is the main hand behind the genius that is Radiohead) creates musical pieces for the film that range from sublime, moving compositions, to nerve-shattering, pulsating string-arrangements. The film also employs works by Brahms and Arvo Part that complements the atmosphere perfectly.      Still, the greatest praise for There Will Be Blood belongs to the writer/director: P.T. Anderson. With his fifth picture, Anderson has become one of the most important American directors that still makes films. There were many moments where I had toremind myself that it is directed by Anderson, and not somebody like John Huston or Stanley Kubrick. The film actually seems like the type of western that Kubrick would have made. And, in my opinion, that's the greatest compliment a director can receive for his work.     Whether you love it or hate it, There Will Be Blood is a film that you won't easily forget.
B000002O5L|4.0|A pretty strong album from Tom Petty, Full Moon Fever offers up a great mix of harder, driving rockers and slower, more laid back numbers.  The result is an album that never leaves a listener bored for lack of variety.
B00015TOCY|5.0|Eno's next album &#34;Another Green World&#34; is most often cited as his best and most influential, and it certainly is a great one, but &#34;Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy&#34; is my personal favorite. The combination of experimentation, humor, and plenty of pop hooks make this a classic, though a decidedly odd one.<br /><br />Eno handles all the vocals and, while he certainly is no great singer technically (he's refered to himself as a &#34;non-musician), he does have a unique. mannered style that grows on you. I don't know if you can call it a &#34;concept&#34; album, but there are some threads that run through the songs - travel, conspiracy, China. Each song has a unique sound texture to it, resulting from unorthodox instrumentation (one song has a typewriter solo) and Eno's trademark and groundbreaking sound treatments. The album starts of with a very melodic pop ditty called &#34;Burning Airlines Give You So Much More&#34;. That incongruity sets the tone for the rest of the album. &#34;Third Uncle&#34;s scratchy, staccato guitars foreshadow Gang of Four and Wire, among others. The most challenging listen on the album is definitely &#34;Put a Straw Under Baby&#34;, which is a derranged, deliberately out-of-tune lullaby with surrreal lyrics, and features the Portsmouth Sinfonia. The Sinfonia, of which Eno was a member, has only two requirements - that members honestly try to play well, and that they show up for rehearsals. You need to hear this to believe it! Quite honestly it's a bit of an &#34;Excedrin Moment&#34;, but very creative. The closing title track is a pretty, airy, melodic piece that presages the ambient direction that he would take, starting with his next album (A.G.W.).<br /><br />This album was released in 1974 and was ahead of its time. Eno had a huge influence on all sorts of new wave and post-punk bands that came on the scene some years later, starting with Talking Heads. I first heard the album in the late 70's and even then I remember how odd the album sounded. It's a clich&eacute;, but one of Eno's talents is his ability to &#34;think outside the box&#34;. In an interview David Bowie, who worked with Eno in the late 70's on some groundbreaking albums, said they deliberately threw away the instruction manuals for the synthesizers, to see what kind of &#34;bleeps and farts&#34; they could come up with. Eno took (and further delveloped) elements from the avant-guarde and applied them to pop music. Many of these innovations have since become part of the mainstream (sampling, incorporation of non-musical elements), and the electronics sounds decidely retro now, bu the creativity and quirkiness still makes it sound like nothing else. Historical significance aside, this is also a very enjoyable album. Highly recommended.ded. It's a cliché, but one of Eno's talents is his ability to &#34;think outside the box&#34;.

B000002J3W|3.0|Some think this is Skid Row's best work, perhaps in an attempt to go against the grain or to avoid anointing their more famous albums, Skid Row and Slave to the Grind, as their best.  But this is deluded nonsense.  Neither as catchy as their self-titled debut, nor as aggressive as the stellar Slave, Subhuman Race comes off as a band that has lost its identity, and is trying to compete with more recently successful bands like Pantera by taking the aggression in a new, clearly thrash influenced direction.<br /><br />But, for the most part, it doesn't come across as an incredibly successful effort.  Most of the tracks lack the character that was to be found, in abundance, on Slave and the highlights of the album are barely equal to the filler on that, the most outstanding of Skid Row's efforts.<br /><br />There are some quality tracks, which salvage the album for the hardcore fan (\\"Remains to be Seen\\" in particular), though they're just not up to Skid Row's best, overall.
B000002B7M|5.0|After Ozzy Osbourne's, uh, split with Black Sabbath, he fell into a reclusive drug-laced alcoholic depression. He busted out of that state of misery with a heavy-metal classic. Blizzard Of Ozz (1980) features Ozzy teamed with guitar superstar Randy Rhoads, and the album is metal guitar heaven. Ozzy is at the top of his game as a singer, and the songs are all choice cuts. Blizzard Of Oz is the perfect storm. Randy rips lightning from the sky with his electric axe while rock veterans Bob Daisley (bass) and Lee Kerslake (drums) provide the furious thunder, and Ozzy whips up the wicked winds with his raging vocal performance.<br /><br />Blizzard comes right out rocking with I Don't Know and the wild classic Crazy Train. It calms down with the lonely anthem Goodbye To Romance and Dee, a short classical guitar instrumental. Suicide Solution rocks as hard as anything here, and was dedicated to the late Bon Scott of AC/DC. The surreal classical-metal Mr. Crowley is a tribute/letter to Aleister Crowley, the British occult philosopher. Revelation (Mother Earth) is an epic track that references the book of Revelations in The Bible, and ponders the future of the planet, including the apocalypse.<br /><br />This is essential Ozzy, and a heavy-metal must-have. It's that's simple.<br /><br />*Beware of the newer 2002 re-issue of Blizzard Of Ozz: Different bass and drum tracks have been dubbed in over the original recording.
B000001FQ4|3.0|A largely subdued album, and a bit of a dropoff between Vagabonds of the Western World and the creation of the traditional Lizzy sound on Fighting, Night Life finds its best moment in the mournful blues of \\"Still in Love With You.\\"  But, for the most part, it doesn't live up to the rest of the Lizzy catalog.
B00000724P|2.0|Ok first off. This is a great album. But the rating here is because of the price.<br /><br />The only reason Amazon is able to come up with to charge this much for this particular CD is it has one bonus track \\"The Prince.\\"<br /><br />Here's the real CD. [[ASIN:B000002H6C ...And Justice for All]] If you really want the extra track you can find it several other Metallica releases - and for a lot cheaper.
B000001F75|4.0|Their last album as a trio, and before the twin guitar attack was born, Vagabonds of the Western World finds Thin Lizzy going for a harder edged sound, immediately noticeable on the twangy blues rock of \\"Mama Nature Said.\\"  \\"The Hero and the Madman\\" follows, and is a very unique track that reminds one of cliffhanger dependent television series, and balances a funky, subdued rock n' roll with a creative vocal approach on the story told by the lyrics.<br /><br />These two hard rockers set the stage for \\"Slow Blues,\\" which (as the title suggests) slows things down a bit, with some funky guitar and soulful singing, before \\"The Rocker\\" picks it back up (Oh, how I do love rock songs ABOUT rockin'!).  This is really a great track, and probably the album highlight.<br /><br />Traditional Irish song \\"Whisky in the Jar\\" makes an appearance, given a more rockin' treatment by Lizzy, with some strong guitar work that makes it an easy favorite, and the album closes on a very cool, bluesy number \\"Broken Dreams,\\" that is yet another highlight.<br /><br />Overall, it's a strong album that showcases Lizzy's ability to really rock out in a period before their sound became solidified.  Good stuff!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is a brilliant, fun, and entertaining movie for all ages.  It's excellent at engaging all the senses!  As a result I was inspired to do more cooking:-) I highly recommend watching this, whether you have kids or not.
B0000074FL|4.0|Man, does this album get off to a great start!  \\"Angel of Death\\" kicks off what seems to be a thoroughly grittier Lizzy sound in great fashion, showing that they've taken their proto-metal approach and have added to it some of the metal that they themselves inspired.  \\"Renegade\\" continues this approach, at points, a combination of heavy riffs and somewhat softer vocals, at least in the beginning.  All together, this album seems a clear step toward the sound they find on their final album, Thunder and Lightning.  It's a harsher Lizzy, and a more aggressive Lizzy, to be found on these last few albums, and they're fully successful in doing so.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Fantastic movie with great music. The actors in this movie do justice to the master pieces that the Beatles originally created. Also portrays American history to a T. A worthy movie to own and while you are at it get the deluxe
B0000017CA|4.0|Heavy and dark, though perhaps not so strong as its follow-up, Paegan Terrorism Tactics.  While strong, it lacks the variety and character on the later album, and would also have been well served by a slimming down, reducing some of the more repetitive tracks.<br /><br />But, still, good overall.
0757302661|5.0|I bought this book with my first pregnancy and loved it.  I was totally mentally prepared for a natural childbirth.  Unfortunately, I went against my instincts (and the book's advice) and chose the wrong caregiver. I felt pressure to be induced and ended up with a cesarean section, producing a lovely daughter that was not overdue at all! (don't trust ultrasounds for dating methods or baby size!!)    When pregnancy number two came along, I again turn to hypnotherapy.  I also hired a midwife who supported natural childbirth.  The night before my second child was born, I listened to the CD all night long while in early labour.  Baby number two arrived after a FAST, and basically pain free labour.  People say I was \\"lucky\\" because of my pain free birth.  I know it was because I was mentally and physically prepared and surrounded my self with people who supported me.      I would give birth again in a a heartbeat- what a wonderful experience.  Natural childbirth is amazingly empowering!  Women owe it to themselves and their babies to give it a try.
B000002OX3|4.0|After a  Kinks-esque effort on My Generation, it didn't take long for The Who's true eccentricities to shine through, as is apparent with the presence of \\"Boris the Spider\\" on the front end of this album.  From there, the album weaves an unexpected combination of sounds, sounding part Yardbirds and part Cream.
B0009IW9DE|3.0|There's cerainly nothing wrong with this solid album, it just didn't take him anywhere new after his critically acclaimed \\"Scarecrow\\".  The singles are all as solid as ever, and he has good moments in the supporting tracks, particularly on \\"Hard Times For An Honest Man\\".  I just felt that after the terrific step forward on \\"Scarecrow\\", Mellencamp would get more adventurous; he wouldn't take that step until 1993's \\"Human Wheels\\".
B000URDE2Y|4.0|A fine guitar driven album that does a good job of showcasing Trower's obvious talents, Bridge of Sighs offers a little of everything, from atmospheric blues (\\"Bridge of Sighs\\"; \\"In this Place\\"), to a more barroom style of rockin' blues (\\"The Fool and Me\\"), to a more funk infused blues (\\"Too Rolling Stoned,\\" which at points echoes Jimi Hendrix).<br /><br />There really isn't a weak track on this album.  It's beautiful from front to back, and Trower does a great job of making bluesy music that is anything by ordinary.
B000002IQW|5.0|There's little question that this is Skid Row's masterpiece.  Much heavier than its predecessor, 1989's Skid Row, and with less connection to the generic \\"hair metal\\" label, Slave offers up a compelling piece of anti-formulaic rock n' roll and metal.  There's really something for everyone here, be it the metal anthem that is \\"Slave to the Grind,\\" the groovy \\"Creepshow\\" or some of Skid Row's best ballads (and Sebastian Bach's best vocal performances) in \\"Quicksand Jesus,\\" \\"In a Darkened Room,\\" and \\"Wasted Time.\\"  Twelve tracks, and I'm a big fan of ten of them.  An almost perfect album!
B000I9U99K|3.0|This is a very good movie with one of the best examples of how much a 5.1 surround system can add to a movie. If you own the DVD you can clearly tell how much diffence there is when the Unbox version is just stereo. I really want to buy from Amazon Unbox but as long as they offer most of the content in stereo only I will stick to DVD's.    I did purchase one episode of Star Trek - Enterprise that is supposed to have 5.1 audio. If it works with the extender I ordered it will at least give me hope they can correct this issue.
1577314808|3.0|The Power of Now suffers from a few problems that made it difficult for me to appreciate its message, but it is a good book if you're looking for a generic (and I do mean generic) introduction to Buddhism, which is what this amounts to.  What makes the book stand above many others of this kind is that it strips away to some extent or at least offers generic references to the spiritual trappings that can dilute or disguise the real power of meditation and awareness of the present.  That said, Tolle does refer to spiritual foundations as an ostensible offering to those who wish to embrace it as such.  Buddhists, of course, will find this unnecessary or redundant at best.  Members of other religions will recognize it as another form of prayer and acceptance of situations that we often have no control over.  As for the downside, some of what Tolle writes is lifted with sloppy paraphrasing from Alan Watts, who coined the term \\"watcher\\" if I'm not mistaken.  (On a side note, if you're interested in some real insight, cut out the middle man and dig into Watts' material.)  There is also Tolle's repetitiveness and the excessively used crutch of anecdotal stories to illustrate ad nauseam the relatively few major points.  As well, Tolle clearly rests much if not all of his conviction on how it helped him survive his own crises.  Not that personal experience isn't a proper endorsement, but the credibility of a book like this, that should be, for the sake of its readers, as objective as possible, is occasionally overshadowed by his personal demons to which he alludes a number of times.  I have a problem with that because I believe one man's pill can be another man's poison if you don't understand the underlying problem(s).  My own experience has taught me that obvious symptoms don't always lead back to an obvious cause, and that professional help shouldn't be dismissed just because it's a product of Western medicine or Western philosophical thought.  In any case no Buddhist willtell you that being \\"in the Now\\" solves every problem or keeps you from being unhappy.  The Now offers nothing but *awareness*, and *that* can be a very painful experience in and of itself.  Overall I do in fact recommend this book as an introduction to a way of thinking that can lead to a fulfilling way of life, but with the necessary caveat that it is only the first step, and a baby step at that, of many to follow to really understand the power of Now.  Don't expect it to change your life, rather let it introduce you to it.
0321544080|5.0|If you're like me, your bookshelf, nightstand, coffee table as well as your desk, and probably your floor are strewn with photography books (if you have a passion for something, you'll pay to learn more).  Some good, and some, well, not so good.  Rare is the book that has value cover to cover.  Most have some nuggets here or there and for the most part, we feel pretty good about our purchase decision when we can cull 2 or 3 of those nuggets for our own use.<br /><br />Then Joe wrote \\"The Moment it Clicks\\" which has a nugget ON EVERY PAGE!  Trust me, if you were listening to Joe speak, you'd pay $20 for 1 or 2 of those gems.  Incredible.  You just can't past the second page without being BLOWN AWAY!  By the 20th page, this had become my all time favorite book on the subject of photography.  Yes, it is that good.<br /><br />That said, take a look for yourself.  Or go out to Joe McNally's website (it is his name).  Talk about gifted!  If I can take 1 shot in the next six months that even approach's Joe's stuff, I'll be absolutely thrilled.<br /><br />So if you want to get better as a shutterbug, then gift this book to yourself.  And in short order, you'll be as blown away as the rest of us... what are you waiting for... Just One Click \\"The Moment it Clicks\\".

It's just amazing how quickly and completely he pulls me in, and how readable he is. Read the real reviews. They praise him highly. I agree with them. You definitely want to read this book. I'm getting everything he wrote before it.
B00006878K|4.0|This is really a fantastic blues album.  Not even close to the most technical thing out there, but Albert King just pours out emotion into his guitar.  It's a very soulful performance.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|Shame on Amazon for recycling reviews without adding a disclaimer.  The reviews complaining about full screen do not apply to the 2008 release.

0452289963|2.0|Through the centuries man has been searching for ways to be \\"as God\\", or to live without God - \\"working life\\" on his/her terms.<br /><br />God's laws of nature  - much of which we don't totally know or understand - are gradually being discovered by man.  It's the desire of man -- to be as God - remember the Genesis (Gen. 3:5) account between Eve and the serpent ... she was willing to disobey God's only \\"rule\\" so that she would be like Him.<br /><br />So, here we are - another case of man discovering more of what God has made, yet not giving any of the acknowledgment to Him - taking Godly principles and duplicating them - so \\"we\\" can be like God, or even gods ourselves.<br /><br />If you believe there is only one and true God, then reconsider buying into this Metaphysical stuff - it's only a weak copy of what the true answer is about how to live \\"successfully\\". Don't get sucked in, like Eve did - it's a slippery slope.<br /><br />Consider how Scripture has already addressed each issue that book topics like these are being expressed. Just two examples of how to think and/or talk:<br /><br /> Ephesians 4:29 (The Message)<br /> 29 \\"Watch the way you talk. Let nothing foul or dirty come out of your mouth.

Put into practice what you learned from me, what you heard and saw and realized. Do that, and God, who makes everything work together, will work you into his most excellent harmonies. \\"<br />Sound like the \\"positive thinking\\" stuff being taught by our Metaphysical friends? [[ASIN:0525948023 A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose]]<br />God taught it first.<br /><br />Again, another \\"discovery\\" of how to live successfully by Man - and, all along, the answers are in the Scriptures already, all one has to do is read the Bible.e has to do is read the Bible.

A GUY THAT SHOOTS PEOPLE WITH AN OBVIOUS FAKE BABY IN HIS HAND (PAUSE IT WHEN HE'S RUNNING WITH IT)AND KILLS WITH A CARROT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ACTION PACKED.

B000UFAURI|3.0|After listening to The Pretender 1000 times, I was expecting this album to be filled with harder, louder songs. Most of the songs are softer. There's nothing wrong with softer Foo Fighters, but I'm not really into it. The few standouts are The Pretender, Long Road to Ruin, and Let It Die, but other than those songs nothing is very spectacular.
B000J10EQU|3.0|I thought the original Christopher Reeve movie had its moments, but reversing time was just too stupid for me to take it seriously. I didn't watch the Salkinds finish killing the franchise, although I did read about the destruction on the Agony Booth website, where they treat me like kryptonite. And as a child, I thought the comics were just stupid. Thus, I was hesitant to see this. But one of my Chinese students, whose English name is Bruce Wayne, said he preferred it to BATMAN BEGINS. I love BATMAN BEGINS. So even though Bruce Wayne's loose lips gave me one of the big plot spoilers, I decided I oughta watch it anyway. Then, in Thailand, Jan gave my DVD to a student before I had the chance. No matter. I found another last week.<br /><br />Superman has always required a willing suspension of disbelief that's been difficult for me to pull off. The flaws in his secret identity really come to light when Superman and Clark Kent both return from five-year absences, and look much alike, and nobody notices.<br /><br />His supersuit is never harmed by the stresses of his lifestyle but yields to Martha Kent's scissors, needle and thread. It's creepy watching him spy on people with super-hearing and X-ray vision, not for some \\"greater good\\" that he has no right to judge, but rather to sort out his love life. Being invincible is boring, kryptonite is contrived, and why were doctors giving him oxygen when he flies through space and apparently doesn't need to breathe?<br /><br />But Lex Luthor finally makes sense to me. I love his boat.<br /><br />On the whole, a fresh approach, a good reimagining of the Superman concept, and a watchable movie. But I won't be rushing out looking for any sequels.
B0002UOK04|5.0|Great melodic death/folk metal from Wintersun!  A bit too tinged with power metal for my tastes, but still a great album.  The songs here are all strong, and I like this more than anything Ensiferum has ever done.<br /><br />Occasionally harsh, regularly epic in nature, and just a great album all around.  The highlight, for me, is \\"Starchild,\\" though \\"Death and the Healing\\" is also a favorite, as is the closer, \\"Sadness and Hate.\\"<br /><br />A key to making the album as epic as it is is the choice to put the tracks in sequential order by length.  As each track is longer than the last, the album gains a more epic feel as it goes on.  I'm unsure of whether this was intentional, but it works very well.<br /><br />Great album...and I can't wait for the much anticipated follow-up, Time.

0765342294|2.0|The story involves a young genius named Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin who is recruited into the military when only six years old.  He is to be groomed as a military commander to eventually defend the Earth against a possible invasion by an alien race.      Ender is, we are told, the last hope for humanity.      Intriguingly, throughout much of the story we don't know whether or not the aliens present a real threat.     Ender's Game certainly has a thought-provoking ending (which I won't reveal here).  However, the novel has far too many problems to be recommended.    (1) Pacing:    Ender's Game is primarily based on a shorter work published in 1977, which the author then expanded to make the novel.  As a result, there is much filler.     The story treads water for several hundred pages before reaching its clever ending.  Readers may wish to skim the tedious middle sections.    (2) Dialogue:    Orson Scott Card was originally a playwright and he employs \\"theatrical\\" dialogue in the novel, i.e. dialogue appropriate for the stage.  As a result, the dialogue scenes are unnecessarily long and meandering.     Readers may wish to skim the lengthy dialogue sections to find the one or two lines that actually advance the story.     [In the appendix to the 20th anniversary edition of the book, Orson Scott Card reveals that he takes great pride in his theatrical dialogue.  \\"Every word counts!\\" Sorry, Orson, but theatrical dialogue belongs on the stage, not the page.]    (3) Scene Descriptions:    The scene descriptions in the novel are spare and lifeless; it's like reading a very concise user's manual.  Efficient, by dull.    Again, this is a legacy from the author's work as a playwright.  Playwrights need not describe scenes in detail, since the scenes will be created on the stage.    In a novel, however, an author needs to paint a picture of each scene, evoking the sights, sounds, smells, tastes and textures of the world we are asked to inhabit.  Failure to do so and we can't reallyput ourselves in the shoes of the protagonist, and so the world of the story remains distant.     This is yet another reason why Ender's Game was, for me at least, simply a bore.    (4) Plausibility:    Ender Wiggin is a genius.  How do we know that?  Because the author keeps telling us he's a genius.  Unfortunately, he never shows us.     Ender is certainly clever for his age.  (He quickly realizes, for example, that any direction can be \\"down\\" in zero gravity.)  But does he ever really do anything that some other clever child or adult couldn't likewise accomplish?  I don't think so.     Indeed, at a critical point in the narrative, Ender is easily and thoroughly tricked.  Wouldn't a true genius realize he's being tricked?     Because the author never convinces us that Ender is a genius, we never truly believe Ender is the last hope for humanity.  As such, the story suffers from a lack of plausibility.     Ender's older brother and sister are also geniuses.  Again, we know this only because we are told, not shown.  We are told they write political missives that insert profound thoughts into the politics of the world.  But what exactly are these profound thoughts?  Orson Scott Card never shows us.    No doubt, it's difficult for an author to invent the thoughts and exploits of true geniuses.  But Card needed to find some way of conveying that genius for the story to have worked.    (5) Story Structure:    The novel presents Ender and his older brother Peter as antagonists.  Indeed, throughout much of the novel, Peter is seen as the primary villain of the story.  So we expect a final confrontation between Ender and Peter that will resolve their conflicts.  Yet we get none.  As such, the ending fails to truly satisfy the reader.    Also, the ending seems to come from an entirely different story.  And, indeed, it does.  The ending was derived from the author's original outline for a different story called \\"Speaker for the Dead.\\" [Later, Orson Scott Card wrote a novel of the same name, as a sequel to Ender's Game.]    Hence, the ending of Ender's Game, though thought-provoking, doesn't entirely work in the context of the novel that precedes it.  The tone and pacing of the final chapter are completely different from the rest of the story.  This is not surprising, since that final chapter is mostly there just to set up the sequel.     ---------    Despite these and other flaws, Ender's Game won both of the Hugo Award and Nebula Award when first published.  I suspect the award voters were tired of the many cyberpunk novels of that era and found Ender's Game to be a refreshing \\"old school\\" science fiction novel, in the tradition of Robert Heinlein.     This is not to say that the novel is without merit.  Certainly, the story has resonated with many readers, particularly younger ones who can more readily identify with the child protagonist.     Still, I'd say Ender's Game is for hard-core sci-fi fans only.     But then again, if you're a hard-core fan, you'd have read it long ago...    P.S.  I had listened to the audio version of the novel.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed the story more had I read the book and been able to skim through the many dull sections.     As to the performances, the primary narrator--Stephan Rudniki--was excellent.  The female narrator--Gabrielle de Cuir--was too cloying for my tastes.  Harlan Ellison and Orson Scott Card both make \\"cameo\\" appearances in some scenes and acquit themselves well.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I have to say I have been an Enigma fan for a long time, and after buying   A Posteriori it only keeps me wanting more Enigma. Each Album is different which makes them so important and unique. They are able to satisfy whatever mood I am in, its pure and perfect. A Posteriori is unlike the others, there are new sounds that come alive every time I listen to it. The sound of classic Enigma, to the Modern day voice of Enigma are heard throughout every song. I promise you that you will not be disappointed with what is offered to you, when you open mind, body, and spirit to A Posteriori.     If you are an Enigma fan then you will love this album, its different, its exciting and its an addition to a collection that will last forever.

B00000ICN5|5.0|This is really an awesome album from the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble.  He plays so prolifically across different blues styles and makes them all sound great.  Each time I come back to this, I'm stunned anew at SRV's abilities.<br /><br />He's very missed.<br /><br />Anyway, the album sounds great, so high marks for the remastering!<br /><br />As for the bonus tracks, the gritty slow blues of \\"Tin Pan Alley,\\" a favorite off of Stevie Ray Vaughan's later album In Step is a welcome variation, and the inclusion of three live tracks is certain to derive interest from SRV fans.  \\"Testify\\" is played with great energy as is closer \\"Wham!\\"  Bonus material is always nice, and it's some good stuff, here.  Nothing better than the album itself, but still a nice addition.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I just got the DVD sets for season 1 and 2.  I am LOVING this show.  The acting and stories are really good and unique.  I like that they use actual lore as well!  Here's to a long and fun ride with the Winchesters!!!
B000ZLFALI|2.0|Count me among the reviewers who were underwhelmed by \\"Across the Universe.\\"  Julie Taymor is overflowing with creative theatrical genius (i.e. Lion King, Titus), and this film does have some fantastic visual moments, but the use of the Beatles' cosmically brilliant catalog feels shoe-horned into the script in far too many instances. I won't go into storyline details here; suffice to say that, for those expecting a profound story of love and peace, eyes will roll.    The movie also trips over itself with too much clumsy social commentary. Most glaring is an odd bit of dialogue that suggests giving birth is pure narcissism (so why not try adoption?). Huh? And did you know that white settlers in American killed Indians when they got here? Thanks for the myopic history lesson. Get on with it already.    The acting in the movie is really very good, and the actors themselves make a good try at singing the Beatles' songs. But bottom line, hearing someone -- anyone -- other than the Beatles sing these songs just doesn't work, for whatever intangible reason. Watching someone else do so, it becomes quite clear that the distinct personality and voices that Paul, John, George, and Ringo brought to their music was an indispensable ingredient of the magic.    And in the end, the Beatles' mission ended up being about love, peace, and a certain artistic musical magnificence that we will never see the likes of again. Taymor is clearly trying to capture that essence. But ladeling their songs over a fragmented story filled with disillusioned characters (many bland; some ridiculously trippy) and warmed-over '60s ideology ends up feeling kind of cheap.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I am not a Bond fan. And, after Pierce Brosnan did a horrible job (in my opinion) at being Bond, I didn't ever think I would be one.<br /><br />But, then here come Daniel Craig. Pretty much being the best Bond, in my opinion. Yes, there was Sean Connery, but for my generation, Craig = Bond.<br /><br />In this re-telling of Bond's beginnings as a 00 agent, we get a naive, daring, and egocentric Bond that will stop at nothing to get the bad guy, and the girl. I loved the storyline, how it unfolded, and how it was expertly told. Craig, along with Eva Green, do an excellent job of selling the plot and reeling you in. The action is top-notch and Craig looks like he's been Bond all along.<br /><br />My only rant is the sequence when Bond and Vesper go off on vacation. I understand that it sets up the last scenes of the movie, bu they were a bit pretentious to me.<br /><br />However, if you are a Bond fan, this will definately get you into the series again. If you aren't a Bond fan, this will make you one. And, if Pierce Brosnan's snotty Bond made you sick, then Daniel Craig's attitude driven Bond will make you forget Brosnan even existed. An overall 5/5 stars.
B00000C3G6|5.0|Crosby Stills & Nash's debut album was released in the early spring of 1969. I was nineteen years old then, already a huge Byrd and Buffalo Springfield fan. And so how could I not flip over the beautiful air-tight hamonies of Suite Judy Blue Eyes, Merrakesh Express, Wooden Ships and Lady of The Island. As the group expanded to include former Buffalo Springfield member Neil Young I felt the threat of \\"sell-out\\" creeping into their oh so pure. laid-back, homegrown style. Sure Helpless and Country Girl extended their reach, providing a dynamic that may have been missing from that brilliant debut album. Yes Nash continued to grow as a songwriter with Teach Your Children and Crosby's Almost Cut My Hair became the Freak Flag Anthem for every kid across America who wanted to grow his hair. Yet at the same time I felt a certain loss of innocence...a kind of sense that this was more than just an impomtu gathering of great muscians creating songs and performing for nothing more than their own self gratification. In short CSN&Y became an arena act and a brand name.<br /><br />Then in 1970 and 1971 the group seemed to splinter. Stephen Stills put out his self titled solo effort. Neil Young countered with one of his masterpieces After The Gold Rush and David Crosby assembled what could only be described as a gathering of the tribes, (Grace Slick, Paul Kantner, Jack Casady, Joni Mitchell, Jorma Kaukonen, Jerry Garcia, Steven Stills, Neil Young and many others). Last but by no means least, Graham Nash's Songs For Beginners, found the Hollies founding member in great form, penning some of his best songs including I Used To Be King, Military Madness and We Can Change The World.<br /><br />That brings us to Graham Nash & David Crosby @ 1972. I guess the best way to desribe this album is to say that both kind of took a step back. Yes they both enjoyed early success in their respective bands The Byrds and The Hollies in the mid to late sixties. Both had composed some beautiful songs the likes of Carrie-Anne, Bus Stop, Eight Miles High and Mind Gardens. And now here was their opportunity to put together a collection of their best song writing to date. Here was a chance to perform not as super-stars, but as musicians, kindred spirits and friends.<br /><br />The results?...Well, just listen to the opening chorus of Southbound Train or Page 43. No these guys aren't doing it for the money or the fame. They simply love singing together. And what of their song writing? well consider this...Here it is February 2008...We're on the eve of a historic presidential election. There's an unpopular war going on. The incumbent President is politically inept, even despised. And what do you suppose is one of the major issues?...You guessed it....Imigration. Well sit back...Listen and read between the lines and see just what Graham Nash, (an immigrant himself) has to say on the subject. \\"Immigration Man...I won't tow your line today...Let Me In.\\" I dare say his position is a whole lot more relevant today than presidential hopefuls the likes of McCain, Clinton and Obama.e-Anne, Bus Stop, Eight Miles High and Mind Gardens.

0307237702|1.0|Pretty much what one would expect from someone with a limited understanding of how the world works outside the South Side of Chicago. An admirable individual no doubt, and one suitable to work as a community activist, but Mr. Obama's idealism seems incredibly naive when faced with fighting terrorists who won't hesitate to kill 3,000 innocent civilians or saw off the heads of reporters.  His apparent lack of education of history and basic economics is breathtaking, and if elected, will lead to a four years of chaos and a return of Republicans to power.  Yes we can....
B0011NVCO8|3.0|I must say that Denzel owns every frame of this movie. It was an intense gangster drama and kept me on my seat's edge until the very end where I felt something was missing. Universal has lost tons of revenue by releasing this movie for a nearly dead format. HD DVD returns are phenomenal and you can see how many open box players amazon is selling. This movie is not worth your movie on HD DVD. Get it on standard DVD instead with the extended director's cut. Little extras and a dead format = less sales and losses for the studio.
6305081751|5.0|Mask is my all time favorite movie.  It is beautiful, touching, just phenomenal.  I very much prefer the original version over the more currently released version.  The music in the original (although not what Bogdanovich had in mind while writing it) is superior to the Bruce Springstein soundtrack on the new one.  I gotta love the Bob Seger, Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Grateful Dead in the original.  Perhaps I'm a Mask purist.  Perhaps I'm just a classic rock lover at heart.  I think I am both and that's why I love the original and the new release feels like an imposter.  There is no room for the boss in this film in my opinion.
630521610X|3.0|When \\"Scream\\" first came out, 12 or 13 years ago I loved it. Because it seemed to be such a funny and clever film. Keep in mind, I was 12 when I first saw this movie. I just watched \\"Scream\\" the other day on Encore Mystery (because heaven knows that network TV has gone to hell in a handle basket!) and experienced a totally different feeling about this movie.    This movie is just a ridicules farce because it's such a cliche. If anyone is over the age of 12 and can't tell who the killer is then he or she probably had a lobotomy. And, most of the characters were so annoying. The 2 killers acted like they totally wanted to get in each other's pants, they didn't seem like murderers. Courteney Cox (as Gale Weathers) was so foolish because she's such a lousy actress. Courteney Cox' acting          (in)capabilities rival that of Madonna. The only good scene with her was when she got punched in the face.     I did like Rose McGowan (as Tatum Riley.) She came off as believable. But why did they have to kill her? And I sorta liked Jamie Kennedy (Randy) because he was so funny, \\"virgins don't get killed.\\" But overall, most of the movie is really not worth watching.    The best part of the movie is the beginning with Drew Barrymore (as Casey Becker.) Drew was only in that first clip, but she still received star billing. She's not in the rest of the movie, but her first scene is certainly the very best because she's really the only true actress in this movie. (BTW, am I the only one who thinks that Drew was wearing a really fugly-looking wig?)      There are also a few aspects of this movie that are fundamentally wrong:    1) Neve Campbell - She's not a very good actress either. The producers should of shelled out a few more bucks so that Drew would of stuck around for the entire movie.    2) Tatum being killed - In all horror movies the good friend/nice girl is never killed off. I don't get why they had to kill her off.    3) The 2 stupid nimrod-killers weren't even frightening- And, they also explained everything at the end in detail. Who does this? This is so ludicrous!     I was going to give the movie a 2 star rating, not 3 stars because it's really a 2 and a half star movie at the very best. But I figured I would be generous and round up to a 3. Sweet dreams are not made of these.
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|\\"Oh my God, they sound like Zeppelin!\\"  How many times have I heard that?  Too many.<br /><br />Truth is, this sounds more like a Led Zeppelin cover band that decided to write their own music in Zep's style.  Wolfmother do succeed on occasion.  Parts of \\"Woman\\" seem very reminiscent of the great band, but for the most part they're unsuccessful.  It ain't easy to be Zep.<br /><br />But, I can't blame them for trying.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I've been a Beatles fan since I was a kid and was even lucky to be front row at Live 8 when Paul McCartney performed.  This movie did the band justice and was a work of art.  I highly recommend it to everyone.
B000WTSWTK|5.0|Since I was unable to see the top female tour of 2007 live, as soon as I heard \\"Back to Basics:Live and Down Under\\" was going on DVD to Best Buy, I had to go get it asap. And I must say, I am more jealous than ever of those who saw it in person. Because even Christina Aguilera in my living room was an unbelievable experience!    While Christina has always been an amazing singer, she has not gone all out performance wise. This time, however, she stepped it up, and included theatrical dancing, extensive props, video clips, and crowd participation along with her \\"voice of this generation\\".    Christina truly is a one-woman show, and considering that she was in her first trimester of pregnancy during this concert is just mind-boggling!    Many of the songs on 2006's Back to Basics were clearly meant to be performed live. Skippable tracks on the album such as \\"Welcome\\" and \\"Nasty, Naughty Boy\\" are highlights of the show, especially with a \\"volunteer\\" for the latter song.    Other highlights are the beautiful \\"Hurt\\", solo rendition of \\"Lady Marmalade\\", fun and spunky \\"Candyman\\", intro \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", and powerful encores \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Fighter\\".    I highly recommend this dvd, for anyone who enjoys a great show.
B000WTBMBK|5.0|I found this by accident. I was searching for best albums of 2007 and I found a site that didn't list the same things everyone else did. This, Burial that is, was number one. So, I looked it up. It was one of the best music decisions I have ever made. This is awesome. Relaxing & interesting & original & new (for me) & blissful...Just check it out. You won't be disappointed.
B0010ZR160|5.0|I am usually not a big action/mystery/thriller person, but this movie was truly AMAZING.  The acting is great and Ben Affleck shows some real talent for directing.

B000001F9E|5.0|Hardcore fans of any band will usually play favorites with a band's less famous albums, and they've often right to do so.  But, there's a reason why Jailbreak is the most famous offering from Thin Lizzy.  Now, granted, if you think only of \\"The Boys Are Back in Town,\\" when you hear of Lizzy, then you're probably not a serious fan.  But there's not a weak track on this album.  Front to back, it's stellar!
B000VWE5OY|1.0|I was anticipating so much the arrival of the DVDs and especially so after paying a bomb for it. When it arrived, I tore open the packaging and immediately started viewing. 1st espisode and I was telling myself \\"Ok, why don't I watch another espidoe?\\". By the second espisode I was ready to give up. The plot is so lame and the characters are so shallow! The special effects are soooooo bad! Personally, I think this DVD is overpriced! :-(
B000O5AYCA|4.0|A friend told me about this band a while back, and I regret that I waited so long to buy it. \\"Boxer\\" has a great flow from start to finish. The production is top notch. If you are into this style of music, and are on the fence about the purchase - I say go for it. This band has made a great record which has me looking for their older material. I'm hooked.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Aside from the hours of bonus features, the filmscore by Harry Gregson-Williams faithfully evokes both the spirituality of the Crusaders' Latin Kingdom and the haunting Islamic strains of the Arab world.  It ranks with some of the finest music ever written for the screen. There's a 123-voice Bach choir as well as Turkish musicians from Istanbul.  Eva Green is the mesmerizing Christian Queen of Jerusalem...the camera cannot get enough of her. Together with the brilliant cinematography, the film is a visual treat for the senses whatever one may think of the story. And although Edward Norton's face is always masked as the leper King of Jerusalem, his acting deserved an academy award.  The Four-Disc (extended) Special Edition is the way to go and a far cry from the butchered version which appeared in the theatres.
B000002OZY|4.0|A rock opera?  A concept album?  Just rock n' roll?<br /><br />Eh, it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />What matters is the quality of the music.  There's little question that The Who have pursued a grand vision with Tommy.  But what about the actual music?  To some extent, the album is overrated.  There's a lot here that is less than wonderful, though it's difficult to maintain the highest level of quality over such an expansive effort.  But there's a lot of good, too.  The album really hits its stride with \\"Eyesight to the Blind,\\" starting a stretch of four great tracks that provides a great middle to the album.<br /><br />The second half of the album is considerably different.  It's more geared toward the story line, and the songs tend to be shorter.  Despite having the album's two most famous tracks (\\"Pinball Wizard\\" and \\"I'm Free\\"), it is a weaker showing than the first half, though still generally good.<br /><br />All in all, the album is good, though a bit up and down throughout.  I don't think it's quite the masterpiece that it's hailed as, but it's still an interesting and enjoyable album, and certainly an ambitious one.
B000E1MTXQ|4.0|If I click on a Blu Ray or HD DVD product, I do NOT want to have to sift through 500 reviews of people who own a DVD or even VHS version of the film.<br /><br />Why are you mixing these reviews together???
B000ZLFALI|4.0|There was a point where, upon going to the theater to see Spider-Man 3 (theater packed with kiddies keep in mind), the trailer for Across the Universe came on. Starting out with male lead Jim Sturgess singing directly to camera, a bit of snickering came from the crowd. Not quite the response the film would eventually garner but filmgoers were rather unsure of what to make of the film with some loving it while others either hated it or didn't even bother to go see it. While the film isn't one of those \\"best films no one saw\\", it's kind of surprising how lukewarm the reaction was.<br /><br />The story's really a cliche love story set in the 60's with the use of Beatles' songs for narrative or just coloring. But a more detailed story is that Jude, a British worker, travels to America to find his father and on the way meets Max, a wild do-whatever-I-want kid who comes from a rich but stuck-up kind of family. Jude meets Lucy, a girl who just recently lost her boyfriend in the war in Vietnam and the 2 end up falling in love. But with the war going on and Lucy getting motivated and Max getting drafted, the 2 have to stick together...all the while singing Beatle songs.<br /><br />For the life of me, I could never get into musicals. Aside from Disney films, I couldn't get past the idea that characters would all of a sudden break into song and dance but with the Beatles catalogue as the songs, it's not all that bad. Sung by the actors, the songs get different interpretations that in some cases, and this is gonna turn heads,(\\"blasphemer!\\"), is even better than the originals. Songs such as \\"Dear Prudence\\", the title and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" strangely just sound better and the actors do good jobs; Sturgess particular with his sort-of Beatles-y vocal tone and Dana Fuchs with her Joplin-esque wail. However, some don't work such as \\"For the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" which is not only way too strange looking but it doesn't even feel like a song and it drags the pace while \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" and \\"Come Together\\" could've been taken out as well.<br /><br />But this is a film and to that end, it's sort of a polarizing one since on one hand it's visually inventive with tons of strange, abstract and even beautiful images and on other occasions it's long, nothing in terms of character development and it even runs a little long. Then there's other just strange stuff as having characters named after Beatle songs (Hey Jude, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, Dear Prudence, Doctor Robert), 60's references (Jojo and his Hendrix look/sound) and odd character/song use such as the character Prudence singing \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" to a fellow cheerleader implying an unrequited lesbian attraction which she then feels towards Sadie which then gets dropped out completely.<br /><br />As I was nearing the end of the film, one thought struck my mind: I could rewatch this again one day. While some might hate it and I don't necessarily love it, I wouldn't mind owning it.om My Friends\\" and \\"Come Together\\" could've been taken out as well.

0441013597|5.0|Not much more can be said about this book than has already been said. I finally read it after countless recommendations and putting it off for years. I was skeptical that it would be as good as everyone said it is, but it is. Frank Herbert shows himself to be a keen observer of human nature, political intrigue and conspiracy, religion, and the depths and variations of human emotion. His characters are believable and range from psychopathic and ruthless, to morally weak and conformist, to courageous and authentic. Complex, expansive, moving, and exceedingly well written. I can't wait to finish the series.
B000RJO58M|5.0|Got this on HD DVD as part of my free movies courtesy of Amazon.  Man, am I glad I did!  I had seen Shaun of the Dead, but I thought Hot Fuzz was much better.  I'm not one who will usually watch a movie multiple times in a short time period, however, with this movie, I made an exception and I liked it much better the second time.  If you like humor done with a serious facade, this movie is for you.    On the HD DVD side, great transfer and sound!

B00006IM9Q|5.0|[[VIDEOID:18137401]]I'm a big Blondie fan on quite a few songs but there's a real sharp cutoff on what I don't like, which is actually more than I like. Still there's enough great stuff that they'll always be one of my favorites to listen and JumpRock to. This album manages to include mostly genuine hits - my opinion, of course.<br /><br />\\"Heart of Glass\\" is the first Blondie song I ever remember hearing. It's got a lot of energy and it's really fun to jump to.

B000IONJH4|3.0|First off, I am one of those who liked the movie.  However, now that I have the HD DVD in hand, I find that I am one who likes the longer version better than the theatrical release.    As far as the HD DVD goes, I was a bit disappointed.  Not as good of a transfer as I'd hoped.    Still glad I have it in my collection, but I'd really like the longer version with a better HD transfer.
2070612368|5.0|I've read this book in english and spanish.  I had to get it in french and russian.  So far the book is great.  Yes the humour isn't going to equate to the english version but it's still sufficient, especially for the avid learners of french.
B00000JPYD|4.0|This is fine listening for anyone into late 60s/early 70s style rock. Trower a very fine guitarist, manages to harness the 'Hendrix' sound and style quite effectively.     However i don't know what the fuss is about really?? The 'next' Hendrix stuff was also done by Ernie Isley, Eddie Hazel and Stevie Ray Vaughan to name a few. At least they forged their own story from that information.     Yes Trower writes nice songs and James Dewar is a good vocalist, but to me, this is not a masterpiece.
B0000UJL96|5.0|For years the war between the Federation empire and the Klingon empire has waged, the Klingon planet's atmosphere has been tainted. There is going to be a peace summit, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) opposes to that because he has never forgiven the Klingon race since they killed his son years ago. Kirk and Leonard Bones McCoy (DeForrest Kelly) have been accused of an assassination attempt and have been sentenced to be on a icy planet prison camp. Can Spock (Leonard Nimoy) with the Enterprise crew (George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, Walter Koenig and James Doohan) rescue Kirk so they can clear his name, find out who is the real perpatrator and help with the peace treaty?<br /><br />Exciting installment of the popular ST motion picture franchise is definitely the final film for the original series crew and went out with a bang. I love how this movie goes back to basics from the laughable and bad fifth installment without the overdosing of humor like in that one but has the charm of parts 2, 3 and 4 in it's own right. The film co-stars Kim Cattral, Kurtwood Smith (\\"Robocop\\"), David Warner, Iman (David Bowie's wife) and Christopher Plummer as they give outstanding performances especially the classic ST crew themselves. I love how this movie deals on peace between other worlds especially understanding each other, Michael Dorn who is known as Worf from \\"The Next Generation\\" plays as attorney Colnel Worf. This is definitely a grand finale for the Starship Enterprise crew and is a winner in my books thanks to director Nicholas Meyer whom did the awesome \\"Wraith of Khan\\".<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD contains excellent picture and sound with great extras like Audio commentary from Nicolas Meyer and screenwriter Denny Martin Flinn and Text Commentary by Michael and Denise Okuda co-authors of The Star Trek Encyclopedia, Six featurettes, Interviews, production gallery, storyboards, Trailers, 1991 Convention Prenstation, A tribute to DeForrest Kelly and more.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These headphones are the best things ever made!! For years I tried everything else, the hook behind the ears with buds in ears, the hook behind the ears and just rest ontop of ears, plain earbuds, the stuff that came with my cd player or ipod, or the plain old famous headphones. Basically the main problems of all these are they hurt horribly and made my ears go numb, fell out, didn't fit in the ear, or could be heard by other people when in use.    These headphones solve all those problems, they stay in, they are comfortable, and fit perfectly. In fact many times, I've forgotten I've even had them in because they are so lightweight. I've had them for several years: I've sat on them, stepped on them, threw them around in bags, basically treated them bad, and yet they stilled work until now, after several years. Finally the cord to left side came loose, but I just wiggle it around and it works. A plus is also the cord is the perfect length to fit from your ipod into your jeans, without too much leftover cord to get tangled if your walking or jogging.    These headphones are also great because the sound quality is amazing, for such small, light headphones. But also because other people can't hear what you are listening to, no matter how loud you have it. They were perfect for long car trips with the family (obviously to drown out the music from my brother's cheap headphones;) They are also great for airplanes too.    I totally recommend these headphones to everyone whenever the topic comes up, and am getting another pair, and will probably be buying these for the rest of my life!! :)

1582701709|1.0|An eye-catching cover, prominent position in bookstores across the nation, and an enticing jacket blurb; this book has it all except a reason to read it. The Secret's secret is pretty much common sense even if you do buy into the fluffy, hocus-pocus that it tries to blurt out. The chapters are written redundantly so you get the simple point they're trying to make over and over again, and then there are chapter summaries too! Honestly, I would just read the chapter summaries in the book store and move on with your life. This book is not worth the read, it is not an exciting novel, and it can be summarized with \\"think happy thoughts.\\"  Please pass on this book and allow us to put this in our past.

B0012CQXLU|5.0|I keep seeing in all the reviews of Black Mountain that it's a lot like Black Sabbath. Some even say its almost a ripoff of Black Sabbath. So I went ahead and got ahold of some Black Sabbath and I can certainly say that Black Sabbath couldn't touch these guys. The biggest groundbreaking difference is in the vocals. Black Sabbath's singer is just plain angry sounding all the time. He never mixes is up. Black Mountain is sooooo much more dynamic dynamic. Hard Rocking one second and near dead silent the next. You just can't beat the voices of Stephen McBean and Amber Webber. Two of my all-time favorite vocalists. Together, no other band could compete. This cd will reallly evoke some feeling in you. Its not one of those cds that you listen to one time and go WoW THATS AWESOME!!! It's a cd that you listen to a time or 2 at first and thing \\"that's ok, they could have done better..\\" - especially if you were a huge fan of their last lp - then you keep listening because theres something intriguing about it and you slowly love it more and more every time. Its definitely a cd that you want to be fully focused on the music for full enjoyment though. not for social occasions i'd say. But DAMN. I can not stress how much you need to buy this right friggin now. you shouldn't even have wasted the time reading this! You could have downloaded it while you were reading and been listening by now! GO!!!!  happy listening :)
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Are the plots great.  Not really. They're okay, sometimes clever, but not great.  So how do you explain the large number of not just positive, but adoring, reviews for this show?  Perhaps it is because \\"Veronica Mars\\" offered memorable, flawed, yet heroic characters, played by engaging actors, speaking exquisite dialog that resonated with first-class wit, and sincere emotion.  All of those qualities are, sadly, in short supply.    I am a 56 year old attorney.  I watch football, basketball and movies on television.  But the only episodic television shows I watch are:  HBO's The Wire [[ASIN:B0002ERXC2 The Wire - The Complete First Season]][[ASIN:B0006IUD9Y The Wire - The Complete Second Season]][[ASIN:B000FTCLSU The Wire - The Complete Third Season]][[ASIN:B000QXDJLI The Wire - The Complete Fourth Season]], 30 Rock [[ASIN:B000RBA6CO 30 Rock - Season 1]] and Flight of the Conchords. [[ASIN:B000P2A6C0 Flight of the Conchords - The Complete First Season]]     I love all of those shows. In particular, I'm a member of the crowd that believes \\"The Wire\\" is a work of art. But the only show I obsessed over is/was Veronica Mars. Seriously. I pine over its cancellation almost as if my first love had just broken up with me. To steal one of the show's most captivating phrases, it reminded me of when waves of romance first washed over me and I thought that life and love would be \\"Epic --   spanning years and continents, ruined lives, blood shed; Epic.\\"     Before I go on, however, let me stress the fact that the show features a great wit. You can get a taste of the show's wit by reading the article Wikipedia published at: [...]   (and then consider what sort of show on the WB would justify such a page?)     It is the sort of \\"silly television dramedy\\" that has prompted serious academics to put down their Nietzsche and Shakespeare and write charming, thoughtful essays about their obsession with this show.  Many of these essays are collected in \\"Neptune Noir\\" [[ASIN:1933771135 Neptune Noir: Unauthorized Investigations into Veronica Mars (Smart Pop series)]].      Find out why this ratings-challenged show that the WB network treated like a poor relation, has evoked this sort of response.      Risk the obsession.  Take the chance of falling in love, despite your adult sophistication, as if you still had the heart of a teenager.     The fans of \\"Freaks and Geeks\\"[[ASIN:B0001EQHXO Freaks and Geeks - The Complete Series]] got a raw deal.  But as for \\"Veronica Mars,\\" well . . .    Risk the obsession.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie is really really good. It's all beatles which should attract lots of people. I saw it twice and i love the beatles.
B00005QXXO|4.0|First off,let me say I love Radiohead,and think they are an amazing live band.I was very pleased when I heard they were releasing a live cd.Then,I was a bit put off to see this release has only 8 tracks.I was lucky enough to see the band, when they played in Victoria Park, Warrington ,England,10/02/00, the day before the release of Kid A.The show was recorded by BBC Radio 1.I have a copy of the show from the internet.The sound is great and it has 20 songs.20,not 8.This live disc is a TEASE.Why couldnt they have added a few more songs? IMO, the live versions of songs from both,Kid A and Amnesiac sound much better live.This disc does have its moments OF COURSE.True Love Waits is the jewel here.It is a fantastic ,emotional,slow acoustic song performed by Thom Yorke solo.Like Spinning Plates is another song that sounds great live,the studio version from Amnesiac has too many loops and other wacky sounds going on,IMO that takes away from the song.This version is Thom at the piano,its very moving and strong.The National Anthem sounds amazing live.Better than the studio version.IMO most of,if not ALL of the live version from Kid A/Amnesiac sound better live.3 tracks from this release (I Might Be Wrong,Morning Bell and Dollars and Cents) were recorded from the Oxford gig.That show was also broadcast live from the BBC.If this release would have included 4/5 more songs,this would be a classic release.Since we have only 8 tunes,I had to dock this 1 full star for that reason only.But,the 8 tracks here are fantastic,and worth it.I do, however feel, this was a missed opportunity for a great live release.
0380730367|3.0|By far the best thing about this book is the reuniting of Patrick and Angela, who had a major disagreement in \\"Gone, Baby, Gone,\\" though their reunion is pretty low-key. Other than that, the book is a hodge-podge. The plot is too contrived and awkward, jerking along at best. The main characters are not believable in terms of their supposed powers to orchestrate and inflict mayhem. Others appear almost without explanation and are then gone. The violence seems over the top and not authentic. Patrick's over-large, enforcer buddy, Bubba Rogowski, is a goofball, lethal warrior, and improbable seducer of a sexy woman all rolled into one. And the dialog seems overly cutesy, or something.<br /><br />Lehane just doesn't run a tight ship with this last offering of the series. No way is this book the best of the series or otherwise.
B00005QXXO|5.0|Radiohead live... you can't go wrong. Quit reading others analyzing this record... just buy it! You won't regret it. Take care :)
006113399X|5.0|The name Harry Hole may be tongue and cheek...but, the story of \\"The Redbreast\\" was very well thought out and illustrated with style.  It was hard to put down.  I was drawn into each character and the aspects of their lives, and their detailed history.  Excellent!!!!!! Harry Hole is the Norwegian \\"Dirty Harry\\" Enjoy!
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. If you're a final fantasy fan, you should love this, unless you are among the most devoute of those fans...then you may be used to learning about your characters though 50+ hours of a videogame instead of in a 1.5 hour movie.<br /><br />You will not find some deep seeded and incredibly passionate story. There is a story and its not hard to follow, but you don't get much time to develop it in this film.<br /><br />The CGI is amoung the best I've seen. Though the \\"spirits within\\" movie might have been more convincing that it's characters were actual people, this movie was designed to look more like the game characters.<br /><br />The colors are amazing and the fight choreography-mind blowing. thought the script has minimal complexities and has many one liners that you'd think are child worthy.<br /><br />Personally, I give it 5 starts for being everyhting I thought it would be: non linear at times, happy-go-lucky with some of its humor, drastically tragic...and remember, final fantasy, be it tactical, strategy or whatever you wish to call it, is a fighting game. And in this movie, the fights have never impressed me more.<br /><br />Do not watch this for the story that you grow to love in any final fantasy game. Watch this for a very simple final fantasy feel and a whole lot of action.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I bought this having heard \\"Love Song\\" on the radio and love this album.  She has a very interesting voice, but more than that, the songs are clever and interesting.  If you like the singer/songwriter sound, I think you'll love this too.
141694737X|5.0|My 18 month old daughter LOVES this book.  She says the next animal even before we get to the page.  She also makes each animal sound (except for the camel because Mommy and Daddy don't know what sound a camel makes).  The flaps are more sturdy then some other flap books she has and thus less likely to get ripped.  There's a good reason this book has been a favorite for 25 years.
0007189885|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed my first read by this author.  The characters were real, even though I couldn't understand why they put up with the father, but I put that on seeing things from another perspective.  But  the characters were well developed to me and the story evoked emotion.  I thought this was an engaging first book.
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, is the first book I've read by this author. I had been reading a lot of novels as of late, and was looking for a change, and something short! The Alchemist was the best choice that I could've made.    I would not be considered a very religious, or spiritual person, and I say that because this book can be viewed at many different levels, both from a spiritual journey, a mental journey, emotional, religious, but most important, it is a travel of the mind, and soul. The story is about a Boy, who has a dream of a great treasure. At the time in his life, he is but a Shepherd, traveling the lands of southern Spain with his flock. After meeting a Gypsy and feeling he got \\"ripped\\" off, he meets the King of Salem, where he begins to understand about your own \\"Personal Legend.\\"    From here the Boy begins his travels, his troubles, and quest, to reach his treasure. Along the way he meets people who understand what their Personal Legend is, but either are too afraid to pursue it, or doubt they can achieve it, and those people who never come to realize what their dreams are. The book speaks about doing what you can to reach your treasure, and never giving up.    And sometimes, you don't have to go very far to realize your treasure is right under your feet. From what I took from the book is we should look towards the future, but live in the present, and try to understand the past. I believe everyone will take something different from this book, but as I said, you don't need to be spiritual or religious to take some meaning away after reading.    Life is a journey, and how we choose to get there, either by our own will or something else's, helps us reach our treasure and Personal Legend.
0765342294|5.0|I debated for several minutes about whether I should toss in my two cents over Ender's Game.  Here I am, Amazon:  The 2,451st reviewer of this very fine novel.    Ender's Game has been a favorite on my bookshelf since I was 15 (which was long enough ago).  I thought it might not hold up as well in re-reading it as an adult, but I have only found more to love in this story, and in Card's beautifully spare and clean style, the more I re-read this book.    The depth of each major character is staggering.  Even the not-so-major characters give you a little peek into their souls here and there, and the overall effect is a sense of reality - and urgency, as the Bugger War comes to its climax - that most fiction writers are unable to match.  While Card tends to steer clear of too much prosey prose, his narrative voice is still deeply moving, to the point that I consistently get a little teary-eyed each time I read certain passages, their clean, simple beauty and honest are so effecting.  (I'm thinking of the scenes between Val and Ender on the lake raft, as well as the drive to Stumpy Point here.)  Card's gorgeous style strikes right to the heart.  Such direct and emotive writing is refreshing in the genre.    Ender's Game is so inviting and so easy to connect with that I have \\"converted\\" many avowed sci-fi haters to sci-fi lovers by recommending this book to them.  True, some of them I trapped in my car on long road trips and subjected to the audio version of the book (which is performed excellently, by the way) but still, all people I've ever known who have first read Ender's Game have become big fans immediately.  (The exception being a few reviewers here, of course!)    I strongly recommend this book to any person who loves good fiction.  I don't care whether you're a sci-fi fan or not - Ender's Game has something inside that any lover of good writing can appreciate.

0375701427|5.0|My first foray into Philip Roth, and I'm coming away highly satisfied. I'm actually sad I didn't read this as part of a book club, or in an academic setting, because there were so many themes and ideas I'd love to discuss and wrap my head around.<br /><br />This book, narrated by Nathan Zuckerman (whom Roth has used in previous novels, apparently) tells the story of Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov, who grew up in Newark, NJ, in the 40s and 50s. The beginning of the book tells the story of Nathan and The Swede growing up, how Nathan idolized The Swede for his athletic prowess and good looks. Decades later, in the 1990s, Nathan sees The Swede's brother at their high school reunion, and learns that the Swede's life took a turn for the worse when his daughter decided to blow up a post office and killed a bystander in protest of the Vietnam War.  The second half of the novel details The Swede's downfall, all coming to a head at the very end in a tragic dinner party scene that is possibly one of the greatest scenes of fiction I have ever read.<br /><br />Every element of this novel was pure genius. The scene setting--you feel as though you've stepped back into 1950s and 1960s, even the prose style changes depending on the decade. There are almost no one-dimensional characters--I particularly loved Swede's wife, Dawn, the ex-Miss America beauty queen turned cattle farmer (American Pastoral indeed!) The themes were all intriguing--the ever-changing generation gap, the progression of America as a country, inheritance, nature vs. nurture.<br /><br />This is a very cerebral book. I agree with some of the negative reviewers that parts could be slow, almost boring. But Roth uses his long diatribes and character rants to make his point, so they're worth plowing through and then putting the book down to think on. I also agree with some of the negative reviews that he included too much Wikipedia-esque information, like detailing how gloves are made (I understand this, too, was a metaphor, but it could be a tad repetitive at times) or telling me what a Jain is.<br /><br />That said, I would, and already have, recommend this book to family and friends. If you're in the mood for a deep, contemplative novel (read: not super cheerful) you can't go wrong with American Pastoral.titive at times) or telling me what a Jain is.

B000VNMMR0|4.0|My boyfriend had managed to make it to age 25 without watching a single Die Hard move, god only knows how. To remedy this sad fact, we worked our way through the movies (laughing about young Alan Rickman, huge cellular phones and Bruce Willis with *some* hair), culminating with a viewing of Live Free or Die Hard.<br /><br />I loved the Die Hard movies growing up, and for the most part, the new movie was a reasonable expansion of the franchise. It had a very different feel, but it was still shot after shot of John McClane -- the luckiest policeman in the entire world.<br /><br />A key difference was the politically charged plot line of Live Free. The earlier movies made it clear -- bad guys are only doing bad things to get money. For the most part, the bad guys don't even care about chicks! It's all about cold hard cash, baby. But, in Live Free, politics and revenge are just as valid motivation, and girls even get included. Like I said, a different feel, but not a huge distraction.<br /><br />The French mercs/terrorists, though -- I never quite figured them out. It seems like they were only used so we didn't miss the many German-speaking bad guys of yore. Considering there are plenty of American baddies running around, I think the writers could have gotten away without importing their own.<br /><br />There is one character's inclusion that I totally have to applaud, though. Kevin Smith should be in more movies -- not only can he play a super-nerd to perfection, but he's Kevin-freaking-Smith. I guess I'm a bit of a fan.<br /><br />John McClane (and Bruce Willis) have managed to age fairly gracefully. Apparently he can still fall off of things, play tag in elevate shafts and whatnot with no ill effects. The inclusion of Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), McClane's daughter, really brings home how old he's supposed to be, though. She's also fun in her own right -- I wish she'd gotten a bit bigger of a role, maybe got to shoot a couple of bad guys, that sort of thing. Oh well. Maybe in Die Hard 5.<br /><br />All in all, a fun little movie. We're not talking about modern culture's response to Shakespeare, but it'll keep you amused.l, a fun little movie.

0679405429|5.0|I don't know how it came about that - after avoiding it in high school and watching two movie versions of it - I found myself reading PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I didn't think that the book would be able to much surprise me. But, my goodness, this book is one of the most delightful, compellingly readable pieces of fiction I have ever found. And, oddly enough, knowing the story through the movies made the surprises that the book has to offer all the more valuable.<br /><br />The language Austen uses is fantastic. The book is charming and very funny. The characters are all fully developed and funny, from the annoying Mrs. Bennet to the startling, judgmental Mr. Collins. And the romance is wonderful.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are great characters, and I'm glad to finally be acquainted with them in their original form.
0143038419|4.0|If you have been through a divorce, would love to travel, love to eat and are trying to find God in your life, then this book will enlighten you. I was able to understand her feelings/emotions, because I have been in her shoes. I enjoyed reading it and I recommend it to anyone who has been through an unhappy marriage.
044651652X|1.0|There are more 1 star reviews than 5 star and that is at least somewhat refreshing.  Thank goodness that there is a group of us that have sense and I am very happy to be included into this 1 star group.  A friend of mine many years ago gave me this book.  At the time my wife was having an affair, so I thought that the \\"love story\\" that my friend said was in the book would perk me up.  I could not believe I was reading what I was reading.  Right from the beginning what jumped out at me was the response of the children.  That the children would be excited about finding out that their mother was having an affair?  What, did they HATE their father?  What had their father done to deserve such a response from their children?  What had he done to deserve such a response from his wife?  Did Francesca's husband not deserve the dignity of communication?  She had no real problem putting a great deal of energy into an affair but not into the marriage?<br /><br />It is also interesting to me that my friend (a female) approached me weeks later to ask me what I thought about the book.  I was completely shocked that she would ask me or that she would have given me the book in the first place, since she KNEW that my wife was having an affair and she knew that is the reason why we were seperated at the time.  I remember standing there in front of her with a silence between us and I was literally thinking, \\"has her brain fallen out of her head?\\".  The pause made her pause and she said, \\"well, I guess the book isn't for everyone\\".  Wow - I hope not.  That was about 14 years ago.  I am still married to my wife (21 years this year).  I can tell you that the issue of infidelity took YEARS to recover from.  Lots of pain on both our parts.  Of course this book didn't really want to get into any of that.  Only the pain of having lost an opportunity.  Honestly - let me tell you how it really would have turned out.<br /><br />She would have left with the jerk (I have lived long enough to have actually seen this happen to other couples) and the family would have been devastated.  After all, wouldn't the children be asking \\"what the hell happened?\\".  The woman then finds out - holy cow, this guy is rather insensitive and a loner.  Now that my husband isn't paying the bills, providing food, etc - we have to be responsible and accountable to each other for this \\"mundane\\" stuff.  She also realizes that he was either 1) not married because he is very selfish with his time and wants or 2) been previously divorced for a good reason.<br /><br />The real problem at that point is this.  Go to the top of a mountain and rip open a comfortable but used feathered pillow.  Sit for 5 minutes or so (after the wind has blown a little) and then decide that  you are going to gathered all of those feathers and put them back into the pillow.  You will either find it impossible or you will spend your entire life trying to put something together you never should have ripped open.  To those women that think they would be better off by finding your \\"soul mate - gag\\", think again.  Like I said, I've actually known three couples where the women actually left with their supposed soul mate.  Each time the children were abandoned, the children grow up resenting the mother (interesting enough in all 3 cases it was the WOMAN that left), and each woman found that she was no better off than she was before.  Actually worse off if you count the lack of relationship and damage they cause their own children.<br /><br />In any relationship you can probably find better.  That however, is not the point.  As long as you realize that people (spouses and children) are not cars that you decide to change out because something \\"better\\" comes along, families will continue to suffer.<br /><br />She wasn't looking for a truly loving relationship, she was looking for the fantasy of a loving relationship and that is all she ended up with - the fantasy.  Two weeks does not create a relationship of any depthor even understanding, it is only about the superficially emotional feelings that are present.  That makes them no different or responsible than two immature high school kids playing at being grown ups.  As Spock once said, \\"you will find that wanting something is not the same as having it, it is not logical, but it is often true\\".<br /><br />I give the story the one star just because I think the message is truly horrendous.  Do you really believe that if you were in Francesca's husband's shoes you would think this romantic?  Or any real kid find it romantic that their mother was leaving a loving father just because she thinks the marriage is boring?the superficially emotional feelings that are present.

B000GH3CVQ|5.0|I echo the sentiments of every reviewer that praises the work of Glen, Irglova, and The Frames.  Rent the movie \\"Once\\", and then hop online and buy both the soundtrack and this record (The Swell Season).  I really enjoyed the songwriting, and ended up buying a few of The Frames records, as well (\\"The Cost\\" and \\"For The Birds\\").  Having been a musician in a pop/rock band that was overlooked in our day, I love stumbling over an incredible band/artist...regardless if I've missed their glory days.  Happy listening.
B000002JT0|4.0|In my opinion, this is the last AC/DC album that 'made sense'.  What do I mean?.......The riffs, rhythm and music altogether is solid and memorable.      You can tell the difference between music that was written while the artists were still brimming with talent and had that natural gift and when those admirable qualities were waning or completely gone.  Well, when they wrote and peformed the tracks on this gem of an album, they certainly still had IT.       Additionally, Johnson's voice was still young and strong as on BIB and FTATR.  As has been mentioned here, the sound and specifically the guitairs have a rawer, less refined tone than usual.......This is a good thing.      Flick is one of those albums that seem to get better the more you listen to it.  Powerful and possessing the musical quality of most any of their previous albums, Flick offers early 80s hard rock that far surpasses anything called 'hard rock' or metal that's coming out these days.    As for albums released after this one, the band seemed to begin to run  out of ideas.  On these later albums, the quality of the songs goes downhill as does Johnson's singing ability.  Also, some of the later stuff is just kind of juvenile;  I mean, \\"Ballbreaker\\" and \\"blow up your video\\"?......C'mon.     The album gets 4 stars because the last 2 tunes are weaker than the rest of the album.  That being said, it is still a very strong piece of musical work that will provide lots of listening pleasure to anyone who likes AC/DC or quality hard rock.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|This move is great!!!  There is plenty of action and drama in this flick.  Please remember this movie is three hours long but this is a good thing.  If you are a Sci-fi fan than you must add this movie into your collection.
B00128O2SA|5.0|I can't imagine anyone but the most hardcore fan paying over a hundred dollars for this item.  The music itself is excellent, most of the songs run together, and there are some moments of sheer intensity only matched (IMO) by the Wetton-Bruford era live beast that was King Crimson.  I'm still digesting this album, and it's a mammoth one.  Whether or not you believe the origin story of this album is beside the point--- you can hear a frantic desperation mounting throughout all of the tracks.<br /><br />As for the USB version, you get access to bonus features on the web site.  In the future this will include artwork, exclusive songs, etc.  Right now there are lossless WAV files of the album.  The design is neat, and it looks like a planchette from a Ouija board.  I'm glad I bought mine.
0321200683|5.0|Many books have been written about SOA, but most of them are just about the theory of SOA. It's important for Software Architects and Software Engineers to understand the theory, but just knowing the theory is not enough to develop system utilizing SOA principles.    This book fits nicely to bridge the gap between theory and practice. It contains not only the theory behind the patterns that can be used to design a loosely coupled, scalable system, but also the code in Java and C# on how to implement the pattern to build the system.    If you are serious on building a loosely couple system and strongly believe on the powerful of messaging system to accomplish this task, then you have to read this book from the beginning to the end, it will help you to design the system without reinventing the wheel.
B000E6ESL2|1.0|Ryan Gosling, Naomi Watts, Ian McGregor and Kate Burton star in the most pretentious, vapid and ridiculous movie I have seen in years. Stay starts with a great idea: a troubled young man who surprises his psychologist by being able to predict the future. But as the doctor (McGregor) rushes to try to save his patient (Gosling), the movie evolves into what looks like the first-time project of a film student who's bent on impressing the audience by showing off how many special effects he can get from his camera. What happened to Marc Foster when he directed this?
B000050HTO|5.0|I am a fan of Bob Dylan's talent. I admire him as a singer-songwriter, musician who plays several instruments, and especially as a poet. I understand very well that Dylan is not Luciano Pavarotti, Robert Plant, Freddie Mercury or Ian Gillan but his rough, nasal and far from perfect singing voice speaks to me clearly. For five decades that he's been a major figure in popular music, Bob Dylan has released over 50 albums including 32 Studio Albums, 13 Live, and 12 compilations. I own The Essential Bob Dylan (Rm) (2CD) which included 30 songs. Of course, 30 songs on 2 CD is just a fraction of Mr. Dylan's very impressive body of work but I am happy with the content of this compilation. It includes some of my favorite songs from 1962 to 1999 written in the different genres - folk, country/blues, rock and roll, and more. Among them:<br /><br />Mr. Tambourine Man - Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me, In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.<br /><br />Just Like A Woman,<br />\\"Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do<br />You make love just like a woman, yes, you do<br />Then you ache just like a woman<br />But you break just like a little girl.\\"<br /><br />Rainy Day Women:<br />\\"They'll stone ya and then they'll say, \\"good luck.\\"<br />Tell ya what, I would not feel so all alone,<br />Everybody must get stoned\\"<br /><br />I'll Be Your Baby Tonight:<br />\\"That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon,<br />But we're gonna let it,<br />You won't regret it.\\"<br /><br />If Not For You - I like a lot its cover version by George Harrison but it is always great to have the original performance,<br />\\"If not for you<br />My sky would fall,<br />Rain would gather too.<br />Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,<br />I'd be lost if not for you,<br />And you know it's true.\\"<br /><br />Shelter From The Storm:<br />\\"Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there<br />With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair.<br />She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns.<br />\\"Come in,\\" she said,<br />\\"I'll give you shelter from the storm.\\"<br /><br />Hurricane - This is not just a great compelling song but the civil action that had helped to overturn Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter life in prison sentence and to free the innocent man:<br /><br />\\"Rubin Carter was falsely tried.<br />The crime was murder \\"one,\\" guess who testified?<br />Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied<br />And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.<br />How can the life of such a man<br />Be in the palm of some fool's hand?<br />To see him obviously framed<br />Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land<br />Where justice is a game.\\"<br /><br />Gotta Serve Somebody  -<br />\\"You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy,<br />You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy,<br />You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,<br />You may call me anything but no matter what you say<br />You're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed<br />You're gonna have to serve somebody.<br />Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord<br />But you're gonna have to serve somebody. \\"<br /><br />Things Have Changed -<br />If ever a song deserved the Oscar for the best song of the year in the movie, it was the one. I love Curtis Hanson's film \\"Wonder Boys\\" (2000) which I see as one of the best films about writers and writing, but after all these years, the firs thing that comes to my mind while thinking of \\"Wonder Boys\\", is the song:<br /><br />\\"Standin' on the gallows with my head in the noose<br />Any minute now I'm expecting' all hell to break loose<br />People are crazy and times are strange<br />I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range<br />I used to care but - things have changed.\\"<br /><br />People may get crazier, times - stranger, all things may change but my love for Bob Dylan's songs will always stay the sameThis is not just a great compelling song but the civil action that had helped to overturn Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter life in prison sentence and to free the innocent man:    \\"Rubin Carter was falsely tried.  The crime was murder \\"one,\\" guess who testified?  Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied  And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.  How can the life of such a man  Be in the palm of some fool's hand?  To see him obviously framed  Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land  Where justice is a game.\\"     Gotta Serve Somebody  -  \\"You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy,  You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy,  You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,  You may call me anything but no matter what you say  You're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed  You're gonna have to serve somebody.  Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord  But you're gonna have to serve somebody. \\"     Things Have Changed -   If ever a song deserved the Oscar for the best song of the year in the movie, it was the one. I love Curtis Hanson's film \\"Wonder Boys\\" (2000) which I see as one of the best films about writers and writing, but after all these years, the firs thing that comes to my mind while thinking of \\"Wonder Boys\\", is the song:     \\"Standin' on the gallows with my head in the noose   Any minute now I'm expecting' all hell to break loose   People are crazy and times are strange   I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range   I used to care but - things have changed.\\"    People may get crazier, times - stranger, all things may change but my love for Bob Dylan's songs will always stay the same
0805079831|5.0|This is an excellent historical account of how the current global dominance of capitalism came to be. Disturbing accounts of complicity by US secret services in instigating military coup's in order to bring down the economies of sovereign nations that refused to play the 'capitalism game'.    It gives a refreshing perspective on the real reasons for America's Wars in Iraq and exposes the utter brutality and pointless execution of over a million Iraqi civilians for western profit.     It exposes the complicity between Governments, multinationals and the banking cartel through the IMF and world bank in ensuring 'democracy' is forced upon other nations.     The direct actions of torture and murder to bring citizens to their knees are well documented.    Anyone who isn't shocked and appalled at the negative social consequences of the shock doctrine should question whether they have a conscience at all. - for the rest of us it is a clear message that this system only favours the wealthy and a new economic system is needed.
B00130EVSS|3.0|First of all, I liked the movie.  A couple good surprises, maybe a little predictable, but enjoyable at any rate.  It's a bit of a \\"yeah, that was pretty good\\", and then you can't remember much about it 24 hours later.    But now the main point of the review... Wow, Unbox video quality is really, really bad.     I purchased a second TiVo Series 3 primarily to use with Unbox and to view recordings off of another Series 3, but on a large 92\\" HD projection screen.  Amazon claims Unbox video quality:    \\"Unbox videos watched on a TiVo DVR are of equal or better quality than videos recorded at the Best Quality setting on a TiVo Series2 DVR.\\"    Now I've seen \\"Best Quality\\" TiVo recordings from a Series2.  I've even played them on the same screen that I played the Unbox video on.  Although the Unbox video might be the same *resolution*, it is most definitely *not* as good of quality.    Problem #1:  It's \\"standard\\" resolution-- maybe 480P.  That's almost forgivable.  Not everyone is an HD snob.  But, in this case it's also *letterboxed* (with the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen).  Thus you're losing probably 30% of your potential picture detail...  So, yeah, it looks decidedly \\"low res\\" (forget about using \\"zoom\\" or \\"full\\" on your widescreen TV unless you're legally blind and/or won't mind the extra, extra soft focus effect).      In all fairness to the marketing guys, maybe the picture is a \\"Best Quality\\" TiVo equivalent in the sense that it's probably an NTSC source at a particular resolution (say 640x480?).  I'm sure it looks fine when it's 5\\" across on a laptop computer.  It most definitely doesn't look anywhere *near* fine at 92\\" diagonal...    Problem #2:  As if the \\"aiiigh, my eyes won't focus\\" look isn't bad enough, the video encoding is really, really, really horrible.  This is one area that it is most definitely NOT close to a TiVo Series 2 in Best Quality mode.  I'm sorry, but if Unbox is using the \\"superior\\" VC1 codec then they need to turn thebitrate *way* up, because the old MPEG2 streams that TiVo uses look a LOT better.  To put it less technically-- the video looks \\"strange\\".  It's as if the objects in the frame are not moving quite at the same rate-- some are smooth, while other \\"stutter\\" when they move.  The fact that the picture looks like it was focused by Marty Feldman only serves to make it all the more bothersome.     (I would venture a guess that they're just got the compression turned \\"up to 11\\" to get a smaller file and make for a faster transfer-- and less load on their servers-- and the motion estimator simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to make a decent image.  See, I'm definitely a nerd.)    Anyway, it's really distracting.      My wife, who most definitely doesn't know anything about the technical side of video encoding summed it up nicely about five seconds into the movie:  \\"what's wrong with the picture\\".    I'm going to try it one more time on a different movie-- and if no better... Goodbye Unbox and hello Xbox Live Marketplace and/or iTune Movie Store...  (Watching \\"The Invasion\\" in HD off of Xbox Live Marketplace immediately afterwards only served to \\"rub it in\\" just how poor the Unbox experience was.)
B000W4KT6E|5.0|Hairspray is one of those rare films that just leaves you feeling good from beginning to end.  John Travolta and cast are so wonderful and the screen chemistry between the stars is amazing.  What's more amazing is the talent that is Nikki Blonsky.  Forget Rikki Lake, Blondsky is way better as Traci!  And what can you say about the music that hasn't been said already.  Very well done indeed!  Now I do admit I don't think this film is for everyone.  If you're a young man who wants to see things get blown up than by all means get Rambo or Die Hard.  But for everyone else who wants a fun film get this.  It's worth it!
B0001XALTG|5.0|Not only is the movie excellent, so too are the soundtracks, I and II. This is one of those rare instances where it's actually worth it to buy the soundtrack from a movie. If you like this movie, check out '24 hour party people' and 'This is England'.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I love this movie. I still remember when I first saw it. I was 9 years old, and it scared the crap out of me. I was so excited when it came out on dvd as it is one of my favorite movies. The only thing that could possibly give it one less star was the ending which was a little cheesy, but still I liked the overall so much I gave it 5 stars. I don't think you will be disapointed!
B00005YJMX|5.0|For an essay project I did earlier this year on vampires, I was required to watch every Dracula film ever made as research.  I'm not a film historian or anything, so I can't say it's the \\"best,\\" but after watching ALL those Dracula films, I can say that it is my absolute favorite of them all.    This film is stunning, to say the least.  There are no cheap or cheesy \\"Hollywood\\" tricks - for example: hundreds of LIVE rats are used in this film, as are LIVE bats instead of silly rubber things on strings.  I don't really want to say too much that would give away every charm of this film, but  Klaus Kinski made an excellent Count (the best Nosferatu, in my opinion), and Isabelle Adjani was the most beautiful Lucy of them all.    Very, very excellent remake.  I highly recommend it to any Dracula fan - or even a non-Dracula fan.  I never really liked the Dracula story, personally... but I love this film.
B00005J6UR|5.0|I don't even know how many times I have watched this but I did see it the first time when I was a kid and boy did it scare me! The line at the end\\" you better check under your bed , cause you just don't know if there is a gremlin under there\\"  made me get out of my bed so fast and run to my mom I couldn't sleep for days. The whole movie is just a classic. You can't help fall for cute little gizmo and hope he gets those ugly gremlins, which is pretty funny. But don't get me wrong it is scary too, you just don't know when a gremlin will pop up at you. Enjoy!
0452289963|5.0|After reading the mountain stream parable of the two monks, from one review given on this site, I decided to buy the book just for that contribution. I'm mainly into New Thought teachings myself, but this seems as if it should blend well with those. Florence Scovel Shinn is my favorite author of the New Thought teachers and writers. Her words just flow and offer much encouragement. It's nice to read more current teachings when they are at the same level.
B000ZOXDFA|2.0|Oh, the costumes look fabulous.   Ditto the set design and locations.  But come on...Elizabeth comes off as shrill, petty, obsessive, and hysterical here, while Walsingham pops up now and then as a prop.  Sir Walter Raleigh is somewhat interesting, as is the queen's favorite lady, Bess--but the story isn't supposed to be about them, is it?  It's also incredibly irritating to watch scene after scene of actors being filmed through frosted glass. Apparently the director and cinematographer couldn't think of anything else to do.  The whole film comes off as surprisingly dull, given the potential strength of the subject matter.  Too bad.
B000CNE092|3.0|If anyone knows the real story of Anastasia and the Romonovs and Rasputin, then they will also know that this movie doesn't resemble the past in any true way. However, technically, this is for children and I guess they wanted to change up the story to liven things up a bit. I can understand that. At first watch, I wasn't impressed with this film. Perhaps because I was too distracted with all the changes. However, upon my second viewing, I found myself getting into it more, and I think it had to do with all the music. This film has a wonderful soundtrack. I especially love the hauntingly beautiful 'Once upon a December'. The other songs are all very good too. So the movie grew on me and I have watched it numerous times now. It is a pretty enjoyable movie and I'm sure anyone young and old will like it, so even with the discrepancies, I would still recommend this.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|I ordered this album after I saw the movie not too long ago, and I have been listening to it A LOT. I love this soundtrack, and it accompanies the film well. Strangely enough, though, the songs are not in order as they appear in the film. No matter, it is still a great album. These songs are so emotionally raw and honest that they break my heart, but I love listening to them over and over anyway. I play this album on my iTunes at work, in my car or at home. It is simply beautifully arranged music.<br /><br />Another reviewer commented that some of us will feel as though Hansard came out of the sky and became an overnight success, but he has a much larger body of music with the Frames and his solo work. I had never heard of him before the movie and the album, but I am definitely going to check out more of his music now. It has been some time since I have heard such beautiful, sad, honest music - and it isn't overly depressing. There is an undertone of hope in these songs, like maybe somehow things will work out in the end.<br /><br />Favorite songs on the album include Falling Slowly, If You Want Me, The Hill, Leave, All The Way Down, When Your Mind's Made Up, and of course Say It To Me Now.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Because they came out in the same year, mant people were comparing this to The Illusionist and claming it was far more superior. I disagree. The Prestige may have more 'meat' on it, but The Ilusionist was far more enjoyable and had a better flow. However, The Prestige is also a far darker film. And the actors attached this this were all a great sight to behold. Hugh Jackman is a man obsessed. He is looking for the perfect trick and is insanely jealous that his former friend and partner has accomplished one. He becomes obsessed in discovering Christian Bale's secret. And the discovery, though intriguing, isn't really that surprising. However, it gets a whole lot confusing after Jackman's character discovers what he thinks is the perfect way to accomplish the ultimate trick of tricks. In fact, its borderline Sci-fi. There are no spoilers here, but I would certainly say that this movie needs to be watched more than once to be fully understood. But it is definitely worth it.
B000X1Z0BU|1.0|This movie was an absolute bore. there was no chemistry between the characters...the music was long and dull. My husband slept through it and I fast forwarded through the \\"music.\\" The characters weren't endearing. The best part was the scenery.
B000GUJYLU|5.0|What a wonderful 'retelling' of Cinderella. Its so unique and lovely, I gush to everyone about it. Its such a pretty movie and the acting and scenery all so wonderful. It is a romance, but it never gets cliche or over the top. Its just perfect. It really is an instant classic. Drew Barrymore is charmingly sweet in this, yet she never goes overboard with her performance. Dougray Scott is a welcome addition as the dashing prince. You can really tell that they connect with each other in this film. If the romance aspect wasn't believable, then this movie wouldn't have worked as well as it did. The supporting actors really add to the film as well. Great job by all!
B000URDEB0|5.0|Okay, I decided to really digest and take my time on reviewing this one, and yes, I've concluded that it is most definitly a 5-star album.<br /><br />While the new singer does not have the operatic reach as we're used to with Nightwish, but rather more of a \\"pop-ish\\" voice/range, it doesn't matter because it fits and the music is truly spectacular. While \\"ONCE\\" is a true masterpiece, this one actually outdoes it musically.<br /><br />The opener, \\"THE POET & THE PENDULUM\\" is a magnificent opener, similar is scope to one of Nightwish's other powerful songs, \\"Ghost Love Score.\\" This 11 minute tune blisters-- truly divine.<br /><br />Some other standout songs include \\"Bye, Bye Beautiful,\\" \\"Amaranth,\\" and the pop-ish, yet majestic, \\"For the Heart I once Had.\\"<br /><br />For the metal heads there is \\"Whoever Brings the Night.\\"<br /><br />And then there is the acoustic, folksy \\"The Islander\\" which I positivly adore. It sounds like a tune the Hobbits may gather together to sing while out at a campfire.<br /><br />This is just a flat out awsome album. They've tweaked, evolved, changed, whatever you wanna call it, but I can honestly say, it works.
B00005K3OT|4.0|Tragically, Johhny Depp has only a small role in this film. But, what a fine role it is. Alright, so he doesn't necessarily make the movie, Juliette Binoche is fantastic too, as well as the rest of the supporting cast. They all do a great job of portraying what life was probably like in a small French village, in that time period. It seems like every character is hiding some little secret. Its a great mix of mystery and romance and even a little bit of fantasy. This refreshing movie should be seen by all chocolate lovers, and even non-lovers!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|This was a fantastic movie that I have seen over and over again. This version of Pride and Prejudice is on my list of the best movies I have ever seen.  Even my 15 year old son liked this movie! Pride and Prejudice is a period romance set in the 1700's in England. You will see incredible houses, beautiful scenery, and the sights and sounds as they may have been witnessed in the 1700's.  The acting by Kiera Knightley as Elizabeth Bennett and Matthew MacFayden as Mr. Darcy is awesome.  The supporting cast does a fantastic job of carrying the story line too.  I already have this version of Pride and Prejudice on DVD as well as the music CD from the movie.  I can't wait until this movie is available for download onto my IPOD!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I think this one came as a surprise for many people. Going into it, I didnt think anything of it. But it was actually quite good and one of the better films from last year. Edward Norton's character is a skilled magician who once lost a girl that he loved. Years later, they reuinite, and that is where the movie gets exciting. And mysterious. I love the look of the film, the dreary muted colors, the constant sadness in Norton's eyes. It all works. And its all very effective in setting the mood. The ending is completely believable and rewarding. There are no plot holes that I noticed, it all flows very well. All in all, a movie not to be taken seriously, but still a really really good film.
B00007FOMP|5.0|Every now and then a selection of music comes along that begs me to set aside my (sometimes) petty concerns and just to review it as I see it. An important piece of music, such as this, really demands total focus. If not, you will not know how very special it is. Or how it all matters in all our trials here on earth. It is soul music (perhaps), but it cuts through to our heart and, collectively,our spirit that very few achieve. Even after so many years, it remains a milestone.<br /><br />Indeed, what is going on here? This is Marvin Gaye's ultimate plea- to God, to Jesus, to humanity to finally bring some semblance of coherence and something better within all our lives. It is not enough that it is so pivotal for it's time (so unlike the soul and rythmn and blues preceding this), but it delves into harder edged issues that cut through generations. It was relevant then, is relevant now, and will be relevant for the future. That is because it is universal. The urgency here, and what is at stake, is very important. It pertains to our survival and overcoming pain, in whatever form it appears to you. This effort is a treasure and definitely worth your time.<br /><br />First off, Marvin employs many various shades of musical excursions and motifs throughout. You'll hear the sax, piano, bells, guitar riffs and drums (and much more) weave in and out of musical themes in most creative ways. Using the orchestra to full effect - it weaves in magical waves to compliment his voice. And Marvin is up to the task and then some. On some songs it is difficult because just when you thought it moved in some coherent pattern, it changes and then you get some augmented about face in another direction. I think that, with anything new (at that time) acceptance is a hard road. But do not forget you are talking about an incredible, innovative talent here. There are not many that measure up to this.<br /><br />He starts off with \\"What's Going On\\" whereby he gives you the main theme of the album, \\"You know we've got to find a way, to bring some lovin' here today\\". And, from that point on, he will relate, or reveal to you, the hard truth of life and how to go about changing it. Certainly, these songs relate on an individual, personal basis. And, how wise that is. For, if any real, effective change is to take place, it begins within yourself. I like this song also for the lyric \\"Don't punish me with brutality, Talk to me so you can see\\". A plea to connect to a better level of understanding.<br /><br />\\"What's Happening Brother\\", is about a man returning from war who is faced with good news from the newspaper but is faced with a bad economy, no jobs, and bleak prospects all around. He asks, but probably knows, that he's returned to a darkness, instead of the heaven he wanted when he arrived. This song morphs into the heavy laden \\"Flyin' High\\", whereby a way to deal with the pain is drug addiction. But, with that, we learn that the pain is real and does not go away.<br /><br />Marvin then connects this to a plea to \\"Save the Children\\". \\"Who really cares?\\", he asks. The music here comes in certain strains and stanzas, varying the mood and leading to, hopefully, an upswing of hope. \\"God is Love\\" escalates towards a higher purpose. In a way, Marvin creates his own soul gospel sound here. Love, here, is not just a word. It is the answer. And it comes across as pure and not contrived in the least.<br /><br />The groove then gets slowed down just a notch with the nexus of \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" which is an ode to the abuse of our environment. Marvin covers alot of ground here - but indeed, he asks the tough questions of the world. After cruising through this song, notice the dread and flat chords and notes at the end. An ominous warning so take heed.<br /><br />\\"Right On\\" musically percolates along with a piano and flute journey that allows Marvin to soul cruise. That no matter where you are in the spectrum of life, to have pride in the gift of love you have been given.\\"Wholy Holy\\" then becomes an ambient, slow ethereal blessing and ode to God. Filled with tenderness and heart.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Inner City Blues\\" harkens back (with insistent groove) towards the harshness and trials of life. But, this time he is sure that love is the answer to the madness. Again, he knows, \\"we've got to find a way, to bring some lovin' here today\\", and thus, the theme comes full circle.<br /><br />In closing, this album was a bold move back in 1971, yet I can see why it remains extremely high in any list of the best popular recordings of all time. He changed the course of this genre and influenced alot of great artists along the way. Beautiful, eloquent and superb. To be without it, your vast musical archive will suffer dearly.<br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Mery mercy me - Seers ain't what they used to be ---LOVE --- Metamorpho ;)blessing and ode to God.

B0002234LS|2.0|Though short, Secret Window still felt dragging at times. Its a weird type of movie where nothing really makes sense yet you know exactly what is going to happen less than halfway thru. Nothing is really a surprise here. I don't even know what genre to categorize this film into. Its not a horror nor was it really suspenseful. Its just sort of an annoying and unnecessary film, lacking in charisma and a real plot.
B00005JPAO|2.0|While I had heard about this movie and all the hype associated with it, I bought it without reading the description on the back first. I mistakenly and maybe ignorantly thought that this was a movie about Queen Elizabeth's life, but it turned out I was very wrong. I had a very hard time sitting through the whole thing, and while some of the actors undoubtedly put on a great performance, I found this a very boring film.  Had I known this was just about Diana's death and the resulting events concerning the Royal family, I would never have bought it in the first place.
0792164903|4.0|Sleepy Hollow is a pretty cool movie. Tim Burton created a spooky and dreary little world and picked Johnny Depp to play lead. You really can't go wrong. The Headless Horseman myth has always fascinated me so I was delighted to watch Burton's take on the legend. Its great because this movie has just the right amount of elements. Its mysterious, its spooky and thilling, its subtle and romantic too and its even a comedy. Of course, this isn't to be taken seriously, and its really not a scary film whatsoever, but it is a fun film. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Its a really good 'popcorn flick'.
B000002KIK|4.0|This is not one of Black Sabbaths best albums, but is worth the buy.  Its almost a repeat of the last album. It just seams like the last two   albums with Ozzy at the helm were albums where Sabbath was trying to be something they are. However, this song has pretty good songs with catchy riffs. Some stand outs for me were never say die, johnny blade, juniors eyes, a hard road, and shock wave. These did not follow in the tradition of popular sabbath songs such as \\"war pigs\\" and \\"children of the grave\\", but they were just plain good songs. As for songs such as air dance and especially breakout got me mad. All breakout is is a jazz song that has no place in a Black Sabbath album, let alone any hard rock or metal album! Supertzar of Sabotage is way better.    Over all, good album. But if you buy it, dont expect a repeat of Paranoid or Master of Reality because nothing of the sort is to be found on never say die.
B00006ADFL|4.0|To even fathom such scenarios are incredible, but to think it all actually happened, its just mind blowing. Especially after watching Peter Jackson's early masterpiece. Kate Winslet should forever be in Jackson's debt, for he practically discovered her. And I'm so glad he did. She was brilliant in this. Melanie Lynskey is the real star though. She creeped me out every time she turned to the camera or gave her mother an evil glare. Their combined performance was what kept this film interesting. It's almost fantastical in nature. Jackson does a great job with all the different elements, combining the real with illusion and it flows perfectly. Its really dramatic and twisty, you almost want the girls to succeed.
B000002KHH|5.0|This is a classic that no music collector or Sab Fan alike can go without. Saying this album is bad is insane. Every single song on this album is good. The worst song is probably Electric Funeral just because of its repetitive riff but it is still a good song! This song has all the classics, \\"War pigs\\",\\"Iron Man\\", and \\"Paranoid.\\" Personally I have developed a time line for all 1970-1978 sabbath albums.    Black Sabbath and Paranoid/-Breakthrough and innovation era    Master of reality/Vol 4/Sabbath Bloody Sabbath/Sabotage-Metal innovation era    Technical Ecstasy-experimental era and Failure(sorry sab fans, its true. no classics out of this album sadly.)    Never Say Die-Back on feet era(still trying to work out kinks, this album had good songs. Sadly the Ozzman Left shortly after.)    Buy this Album! It is Sabbath at its best. Just dont listen to it to much. I did and I got board with it but its still a good album. I like All albums named in the metal innovation era more just because I've listened to paranoid way to much.    If your new to Black Sabbath, this is the perfect album for you. Actually, Its the perfect album for all!!!!
B000N6TX1I|4.0|This movie had an interesting concecpt. What if the world could no longer produce babies? And it did a fine job of portraying the effects. Though there really wasn't any type of explanation as to WHY no one could conceive any more. Visually, the movie is gorgeous. Its crazy and bleak all at the same time. Clive Owen gave a perfect performance. However, I have a major gripe with the ending. No spoilers here. But I mean, it just ended. And what? It sort of just leaves you hanging without hope or expectations. It jarred me from the otherwise brilliant film.
0743298020|3.0|I came to \\"The Thirteenth Tale,\\" by Diane Setterfield, with high expectations. I'd recently finished \\"[[ASIN:0753820250 The Shadow of the Wind]]\\" by Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n--a book I enthusiastically reviewed here--and I'd heard from a number of trusted sources that this book was similar in tone, and equally as good. In addition, it was the next selection on my book club list. How could I miss?<br /><br />I started it on a miserable February morning, shut inside with my cat on my lap--the perfect setting, I thought, to do homage to a contemporary Gothic. The book quickly drew me into another world, all the sights and sounds of my real world fell away, and I was utterly lost in the story--keenly feeling, seeing, hearing and sensing this other strange bookish mysterious world. I was totally entranced by the first one-third of the novel--fully convinced I was reading a magnificent four- or five-star contemporary Gothic revival. In particular, I was in awed by beautiful passages of prose that pulled me briefly away from the story to savor their artful construction.<br /><br />But the further I got into the book, the more dissatisfied I became. But by the end, I was disappointed--the story just did not measure up to its early promise. Ultimately, the story became absurd, unbelievable, and uninteresting. When I turned the final page, I felt I'd wasted my time...that I would have been better off spending my hours reading another book, perhaps rereading a favorite authentic 18th- or 19th-century Gothic classic.<br /><br />I moderately recommend this book because the writing is intoxicating--the other world is described with such vivid richness that the reader lives within the pages, seeing, hearing, and feeling what goes on there. Dianne Setterfield has definitely snagged my attention, and I look forward eagerly to reading her next book. She is an author with undeniable skill and artistry--I just hope she puts that mastery to use on a novel with greater believability, purpose and meaning.
B00005JPCF|3.0|If you really get down to the heart and soul of this film, you would know that Happy Feet is not really about a penguin looking for meaning and purpose among all the other penguins. It has a hidden meaning that children will not get. Its very clever and only really comes out of hiding towards the end. In a way, the subtle message regarding the environment is a good thing, but its a shame it has to be disguised in a children's cartoon.   The songs are mediocre at best and the penguins come across as likeable, but really, it doesn't have much going for it. Its certainly a watchable movie and does have its fun moments, but really, its almost too adult in certain ways for children to truly appreciate it. But I am sure most kids will like it as is too.

B000SQFC18|2.0|This film is an overrated mess. 4 stories that are supposed to somehow connect. And yet, 2 out of the 4 really sort of don't and are needless. Especially the Japan one. Was it interesting? To a point, but it also did nothing to enhance or help the film. I found I couldn't symapthize with any of the characters except Brad Pitt's. He did an incredible job portraying a man in distress. I love Cate Blanchett, but even her character was borderline annoying.  There was nothing in this film that I truly found to be interesting. It was very bland and dragged quite a bit. All these movies that are supposed to connect characters in some way almost never work. It didn't work for Crash, and this is even worse. I expected so much better.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|I watched my Netflix pick last night and I had to apologize to my wife.  I am not allowed to make any choices for the next two months!  For the filming of the ending battle sequence, I would have given this a 3 or even 4 stars forgiving the very slow first hour.  I can see why the investors lost their $$$ on this.    Since I am rating the whole DVD, I give it a one star.  There is a painful 20 minute plus diatribe from several leftists who think they are intelligent but have nothing to say.  They cited no sources nor provided any analogies.  They just blathered on like losers at work who want to hear themselves whine.  They are the type of people who when many people are appreciating the beauty of a very attractive woman would fix all their opinions on her poop stinking.    I picked this movie because Clive Owen was great in King Arthur.  I will not be looking for him in any future choices.    For those of you who think this stinker was worth more than 1 star, please look again at that scene when all the fugees/revolutionaries came out waving clubs after the burning car rolled down the hill and blocked the road.  So many of you reviewers have stated this was brilliantly directed.  There is no way that scene took more than one take.  You had stupid looking extras swinging clubs and close enough to break windows but doing nothing more than shouting and swinging their clubs.  The emperor is naked and this was a poorly directed piece of doo doo.  Alfonso, you stink!
B0007CNXUK|4.0|A superbly acted film, Finding Neverland never really fails at anything. It gets depressing and morose, but it has uplifting and tender moments as well. Freddie Highmore could not possibly be any sweeter than in this film. Utterly heartbreaking. Johhny and Kate together is somthing magical to behold. They compliment each other so well. I cannot recommend this enough.
1594489505|5.0|This book will make you appreciate the freedom of our society in America.  I couldn't put it down and couldn't stop thinking about it when I wasn't reading it.
B000YAA6AU|5.0|After seeing \\"P.S. I Love You\\"...it is now my all time favorite romantic comedy. Probably replacing \\"Notting Hill\\". Any movie that makes me laugh and cry at the same time is a winner! The opening argument scene was so well written. It was very realistic(my husband and I have argued just like that)plus it introduced the characters history and chemistry etc. Very effective opening scene. I was not a Hillary Swank fan, but she won me over. Her performance is wonderful....I believed she was Holly and Gerard Butler WAS Gerry. Every role I see him in is spot on. I wonder when he will get the accolades he deserves. Everyone else in the cast was excellent. I will agree that some roles seemed to be cut down to almost nothing...James Marsten and the actress who played Hillary's sister, and Gina Gershon.    This movie had some atypical twists and turns and I loved that. I also would enjoy seeing the movie a second time. Because some scenes were flashbacks or out of sequence, you could enjoy some scenes early in the movie now knowing what will be coming up in the future...if that makes sense. (An example: Holly must clean out her deceased husband's closet...pack up his clothes. She keeps his leather jacket though. Later in the movie you flashback years before to the scene where Gerry and Holly first meet and discover that Gerry gives her his leather jacket when she's cold. Seeing the movie a second time, I would look at the scene of Holly packing clothes and holding on to his leather jacket differently now knowing the history behind it.)    If you want a romantic comedy formula movie, this isn't exactly it...this movie has layers and really makes you think while it entertains. I also did not think it dragged for even a moment.    One extra recommendation...buy or rent \\"Dear Frankie\\" with Gerard Butler. Another movie that is a true work of art!
B000YPUF9W|3.0|This series has reached mediocre. Maybe there will be a fourth to pull it out of the rut it is headed for now. The acting, effects, and music are good. The story on the other hand lacked something to give it that edginess the first two movies had. Cloning our hero or making the big bad Umbrella guy a monster didn't seem surprising. A couple good scenes including one that you will say looked like it came right out of \\"The Birds\\" will make you perk up and say, now that was cool. In fact had they pursued more wildlife gone bad it probably would have made a better overall movie. I didn't mind that it borrowed from \\"Road Warrior\\", \\"The Birds\\", and \\"Coma\\", it just needed a better overall theme. That and it upset me they killed off two characters from the last movie that I thought should have survived this nightmare. Good quality DVD and fair replayability.
B0002XVQNU|1.0|A world where Ben Affleck is a superhero could only be Sesame Street. I know Kevin Smith had something to do with this movie and since he for some reason likes Ben he had to get him in the movie. I would lke this movie if it had a competent actor to play Daredevil.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|It is ashame when good acting isn't rewarded with a good story. The cast for this movie were fine. The problem is the writers took \\"Event Horizon\\" ran it through a sunny spin cycle and came up with \\"Sunshine\\". Well let me spell it out and you judge for yourself. A spaceship is going to the Sun to set off a bomb to re-energize it. On the way they see a previously sent ship that has been missing for seven years. They decide to investigate the lifeless ship. Their mission from that point on involves death and destruction as a crazy person from the lifeless ship goes about killing people. Now it isn't as grizzly as \\"Event Horizon\\" with spinning devices that shred people, but the premise seemed too much alike for me not to think it. Furthermore, the first half is good character and story development and the second half is killing those same people and their dreams. I don't regret watching it, I just don't think I will again for a long time. Good quality DVD, but not overly replayable.
B000XUOIQ4|3.0|There are over a hundred reviews for The Aristocats as of this date. They all refer to the previous edition (Disney Gold Classic Edition or whatever they called it years ago when it first came out on dvd).<br />So now we will have those reviews mixed up with new reviews for the Feb 5, 2008 version which offers more extras and a different aspect ratio. This may make things a bit confusing.<br /><br />Moving on...<br />People compare this film to 101 Dalmations. This is Disney's \\"cat\\" movie, they say. You can't compare them; they're too similiar somehow.<br />But they are both decent, cute family films.<br />Yes, Cruella is scary compared to the bumbling butler Edgar. There is a sense of jeopardy but Dalmations is much stronger in that sense.<br />Both films were made using the 1960's Xerox method where the resulting animation is more sketchy looking and more close to the original animator's drawings.<br />The Aristocats is more of a musical, definitely. A few forgettable songs, but also the charming and infectious tune \\"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\\". That is the tune I think of when I remember the adventures of Duchess and Thomas and the kittens. (101 Dalmations had the little \\"Cruella De Vil\\" song, but that's it.)<br /><br />Overall this is a fun vehicle but it is not a classic such as Peter Pan, Cinderella, or Lady and the Tramp. It has a nice, relaxing pace and is probably most appealing to youngsters. The voice talent, as ever with Disney cartoon features, is great. Eva Gabor's Duchess is warm and maternal while Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley is macho yet sweet (and sounds like a lifelong diehard smoker). He also lent his vocal prowess to The Jungle Book when he played Baloo the bear.<br /><br />This special edition for 2008 has some cute extras. But unless you're a total stickler for aspect ratios or you collect every version they release, the previous edition should suffice. It was fine, with a clear and bright picture/sound presentation.
0805079831|5.0|Having just bought this book by the brilliant Ms. Klein, I want to say that if anyone doubts her authenticity, they're simply augmenting, through denial and ignorance, a reign of terror only imagined in Science Fiction. I'm one of those who's seen first-hand, what she describes: my mother having been one of Dr. Ewen Cameron's \\"patients\\", my husband, his psychiatric resident. Both are dead. If a medical student did not obey Cameron, or disclosed what was going at The Allen Memorial Institute in the 60's, he or she was finished as a physician. Cameron was a monster, given unlimited power which we all knew about back then - his involvement with the CIA, and so on. But we as a family were helpless to do anything. Our telephones were bugged,our mail opened. And we had no contact with anything illegal whatsoever. After months in the famous Sleep Room where my mother's mind was literally destroyed through his ruthless experimentation, when we could do nothing to liberate or save her, we learned the whole story - but it was too late. That man, part of a world-wide ruthless system, obviously so aptly described my Naomi Klein, died without all his victims having had their \\"day in court\\". And he was just one of the many, many brutal puppets of a system that chose - and chooses - to exploit the world's suffering in the name of power. Thank you a thousand times over, Ms. Klein.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have watched so many versions of Jane Eyre and this one blew me away.  I enjoyed it so much!  It passes quickly through Jane's childhood and her experiences at school and instead focuses on her relationship with Mr. Rochester.  I loved watching their playful banter and their flirting with each other, it was just so beautifully done.  No, it isn't completely true to the book as the Timothy Dalton version, but that in no way detracts from  the plot, it is so wonderful to watch. The film drew me in, I laughed, smiled and cried right along with it. This is my favorite version by far and I can't wait to watch it again:)
0743277708|1.0|We are reading this book together as a family. My husband reads aloud, the kids listen, and I struggle not to leave the room. My 9-yr old daughter has repeatedly asked: \\"why are all the rabbits boys? Are there going to be any girls soon?\\" Yeah... This is a fantasy, so one imagines the author had a fair amount of room to add talking rabbit females to the plot -- if he wanted to. But for most of the book the female rabbits are relegated to anonymous \\"doe\\" status, as in \\"the does are raising the young and if they get nervous, they might not give birth to as many young.\\" The male characters are developed in much detail. At this point in the book, the protagonist rabbits are getting ready to wage war with a rival tribe, which includes \\"taking their does.\\" In other word, \\"to rape and pillage.\\" Wonderful! In general, I see very little merit to this book. It is rather protactracted and dull, as other readers have noted, and I don't like the message it is sending to my kids, girl or boys. We will finish the book, as a matter or principle, but I can't wait. In my opinion, a piece of \\"hraka.\\"
B000089CKH|5.0|It's catchy, it's fun, it's indie! This is the greatest album for a long drive! Every song is great, of course some are better than others, but there is not one bad song. It will leave you saying, \\"I'm glad I listened to that\\". Seriously if you don't own this, do your self a favor and go buy it!
0321344758|4.0|\\"Don't Make Me Think\\" refers to the way people tend to use the web: they don't read they scan. That means that your site needs to be organized to make identification and navigation as instinctive as possible. Having an efficient navigation system and laying out your content to clearly reveal the embedded hierarchy should go a long way towards achieving this goal. Don't forget a good search function.    One of the main point the author want's you to get is that having external users to test your site will give you valuable insights on how you can make it work for them. He walks us through such a test scenario, which is quite useful.    There is also a chapter on accessibility, which is nice and which gives us an easy way to make our site quite accessible to most. My favorite idea is to add a \\"skip to main content\\" link to the top of all pages. By styling it with a \\"display: none\\" it won't affect any layout would be very useful for blind people using screen readers. Food for hought.    Classification is one topic on which I disagree with the author though it's only noted in a footnote. His view is that \\"things\\" should live in one place on your site and if necessary use cross-references to bring people there. I think that \\"things\\" should live in all the probable places a user might want to look for it. On one side you have a hierarchy on the other you have a tagging system. Given growing popularity and ubiquity of tags, I think that this won't be much of a stretch for anyone in the near future.    This book was certainly worth reading. I have learnt quite a few things and I recommend it to all web developers.
B000VBJEEG|2.0|This movie is quite good, it gets 4 stars. The DVD presentation, however, blows. Disney has, yet again, inserted an introduction that cannot be skipped or fast forwarded over, and must be watched every time the disc is inserted. Why do they keep doing this?
B00000ILDF|3.0|Alien 3 holds the record as being the most disappointing movie of 1992 and certainly the worst of the Alien series. The fact that 3/4's of our favorite surviving characters from Aliens is all eliminated before the movie even gets rolling was an immediate bummer. The overall depressing pace, color, texture, grit, taste and even the powerful musical score made one require an extra dose of their favorite anti-depressant after seeing the movie. That is my overall impression of the movie which I still give high points to.<br /><br />While the consensus of opinion is mixed I would have to agree with the statistics published by AMAZON which are flat and show no clear trend from a large population of Alien fans who were very disappointed in this movie. You can't fight the statistics. The fans just couldn't enjoy even a skillfully done Alien 3 with the feel of a death camp.<br /><br />I believe the main problem with Alien 3 is that the plot was developed in a series of steps by excellent people selected by the studio who picked up the job where it was left off by others. The studio assumed that it could be done that way if it had to be, and it just can't.<br /><br />As the numerous DVD extras include terrific and always interesting technical materials on the making of the movie I would recommend this DVD for all ALIEN fans. The two disk version has the original theatrical movie version as well as a longer version with a slightly different but no less depressing plot. This alternate version, which suffers from a poor sound track, was also interesting to screen when one has the time and inclination. The DVD provides the option of subtitles for interested viewers wishing to indulge their curiosity in an alternate version of Alien 3.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I already had the first season so I HAD to get the second one. This is just a really fantastic and unique series. Any one not watching is really missing out!
0525950079|5.0|I have long loved historical fiction and this book had me from page one. Over the course of the week reading this work I wondered, \\"How do authors do it?\\" He can make you so concerned about the characters that there are times where you almost stop reading the book out of frustration or anger for what the main characters are going through. Mr. Follett has the remarkable ability to sweep you away into a past world. It has helped me understand even more clearly how this time in our existence on earth was not the best time, indeed many things about this time period come as shocking, if not completely horrifying. Completely entertaining, this book is hard to put down.
0792838068|5.0|Extremely gritty and powerful film, with some amazing performances from the two leads. Nicolas Cage plays Ben Sanderson, an alcoholic who has just lost his family and his job. He takes his severance paycheck, and drives out to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. Along the way, he meets a prostitute named Sera, played to perfection by Elizabeth Shue, and the two develop a strange romance. They both accept one another for who they are, and as much as it hurts her at times, Sera does not dissuade Ben from accomplishing his deadly mission.     As you may already know, this film is extremely sad. It is also a film that pulls no punches, and is very raw and explicit - but necessarily so. This film was shot on a small budget on 16mm, and this only adds to the realism of the film. Nicolas Cage's performance is his best to date, and to prepare for the role, he went binge drinking for two weeks while he had a friend videotape him to record his mannerisms and speech patterns. I guess it paid off, because it's one of the most authentic and heartbreaking performances ever caught on film.    I guess you could say that this is one of my favorite films, and this is not because I find it entertaining. I call it one of my favorites because it is so powerful that, every time I watch it, it stays with me for days. Here, you have two of the most frowned upon types of people in the world - the drunk and the whore - and you are reminded that people like this do exist, that nobody is perfect, and that Christ loves these people just like he loves you and I.    Recommended for adults only.
B0006OBPTA|4.0|ive seen these over the past couple of weeks. i agree, all 3 of these movies are great. karate kid 1 is like so corny and cheesy SWEEP THE LEG JOHNNY, 2 is like more serious street-level. the ending is great with the hand drums LIVE OR DIE MAN... WRONG HONNNNNNNKKKK. 3 i only caught the second half of but how can you not appreciate sleazy pony tail guy and his evil grin. NOW THE REAL PAIN BEGINS DANNY BOY
0740748475|5.0|My daughter, who teaches Junior College, has always been a fan of Calvin and Hobbes.  She has wanted this book since it first came out.  This year I ordered it for her Christmas present.  It came right on time, was new as expected, and the look of surprise and happiness on her face was worth every dollar I spent.
0786711647|5.0|I am reading this book for the third time. The first time was when it first came out, then some years later, and now I'm reading it again. Although I don't usually read mysteries, this one is so mesmerising that over the years I have always counted this as one of my favorite books, no matter what the genre. It is fast paced, not an unnecessary word. And the ending-- well, you have to read it.
B00004VVNB|1.0|I suppose it was revolutionary for it's time, but the acting is god-awful.    Read the book, your imagination will do the story better justice.
1401300529|4.0|Halberstam is very good at many things; vectoring in on particular points in history, finding the right sources to illustrate key points, and I think most importantly, keeping the narrative moving and therefore the reader engaged in the progress of history. Because he wrote such large books I think sometimes reviewers expect to be treated to absolutely everything and that is impossible. In this book Halberstam is on sure ground with MacArthur and Truman and less so when discussing military tactics etc...Halberstam really takes Truman to task for the extreme penny pinching that so damaged the army after WWII. Also he gathers an enormous amount of evidence regarding MacArthur's insubordination and outright refusal to go along with US policy in Asia. Many of the quote from Stillwell and Truman on Chiang Kai Shek are priceless. This is another definitive book that isn't afraid to take on the reputations of people like MacArthur and CKS and provides a thorough, thoughtful presentation of the origins and the first year of the Korean War.
0375847227|5.0|A great read.  Well written, captivating, original, and very hard to put down once I got started.    Yes, it does make open criticism of a certain style of self-serving organizations, but that's what free speech is all about.      If you like the fantasy genre, have an open mind and don't like your beliefs, desires and thoughts to be dictated to you by antiquated dogma, then this is the book for you.
B000OVLBF8|3.0|Ghost Rider falls into the \\"so bad it's good\\" category of films.  It's a bit of a fun guilty pleasure too.  Much like the character in the film, Nicholas Cage seems dead in his performance.  Though he's nowhere near as bad as Evan Mendes, who barely acted her way out of the Will Smith romcom, Hitch. There is one good actor in this movie - Sam Elliot.  But he's a born cowboy, and his character isn't too far from that role.    This film celebrates the cliche ridden dialogue of built in blockbusters.  It also has some scenes that scream \\"bad blockbuster!,\\" notably a scene where Eva Mendes' character is chased down by Johnny Blaze to ask for a date.  It's silly, and looks more like it belongs in the aforementioned Hitch, then this movie.    The film actually does a credible job of building the tragic hero out of Johnny Blaze, but I think part of it has to do with Nicholas Cage's natural persona.  The Ghost Rider character seems silly instead of terrifying, and some of the other characters' reactions to Ghost Rider are questionable.  And while the overall special effects of Ghost rider look good, he just doesn't translate well the big screen.    But the film overall seems like a throwback to some of these bad excessive blockbusters.  But it's got a comic book sensibility that's been lost in comic book films - the cheesy dialogue, unbelievable action sequences, and well enough room for a continuation.  It lacks the real darkness and depth of the character, however, solidified in the Ghost Rider books of the early '90s.  But it's a fun campy film that's a guiltly little pleasure - just don't expect it to be great.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I think Kanye is the best rapper currently out there- fresh rhymes, intelligent, and would sound good even without the beats.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I haven't read any Jane Austin, like many of you have.  I just can't get into the style of writting.  So my exposure to Austin's work comes through movies.  I loved this movie.  I saw it on Masterpiece Theatre on PBS.  Unlike the other Austin productions I've seen on Masterpiece Theatre (Northanger Abbey, Mansfield Park), I felt this movie rather than watched it. Here is Anne, confronted by her lost love, watching him court another woman right in front of her.  Here she is, unable to reveal that she still loves Captain Wentworth, about to loose him again.  Sally Hawkins portrayed Anne in such a heartfelt way, I'm touched every time I see the movie.  I thought the movie was well done, the score beautiful, and oh, how I sympathized with Anne.  I can't say if this Persuasion is better than the book, or better than any other production of it, but I really enjoyed it as it was.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Though not a strong vocalist, the producers have a done a great job of making the songs fit her voice. Pure pop fluff, but well worth the $10.00.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This is a small film, a very good one, told large. The director, Jared Hess, is a 24 year old wunderkind from the barrens of Preston, Idaho, and he has created a gem; a cousin to the Coens. This is a comedy that will sneak up on you, the stuff of belly laughs. Last year he did a 9-minute short film, PELUCA, starring Jon Heder, and it seems to have been the outline for this feature film. Hess is from Preston, and he filmed it as only a resident could; full of empty landscapes, lonely roads, farmers, ranchers, and rednecks. A scene where Napoleon gets a job for the day on a chicken ranch is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />There have been numerous comparisons for this movie to WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, and RUSHMORE. But for me this film stands firmly on its own. It plays out like an absurdist straight drama that also happens to be funny. It is reminiscent of some of the best moments in the Coen Brother's RAISING ARIZONA.<br /><br />The film was a big hit at Sundance, and it has been distributed well; a lucky break for Hess. Wouldn't it be wonderful if more of the youth of our country could rally behind this tiny epic, and create it as a cult film; that for a moment they step away from the commedia del raunchy that they mostly immerse themselves in; that they actually laugh at themselves, the way they really are, just kids struggling to grow up? The 13-30 year old demographic dictates our art, our music, and our movies. This little film could go a long ways in restoring the missing heart, the naivete and grace to the comedic genre.<br /><br />One real plus for me was the odd wholesomeness of this movie. There was zero profanity. Most of the time when a script deletes realistic high school vernacular, and changes the language to a lot of goshs, dangs, hecks, frigging, and freaking, it usually morphs quickly into the landscape of the lame. But somehow, Hess makes the lack of profanity work, and we don't miss it.<br /><br />Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Jon Heder,\\" geek deadpan perfection.\\" He loved the film, and directs us,\\" to laugh until it hurts.\\" Heder is a lanky beanpole with a red Afro, all Adam's apple and oversized glasses, and overbite. At first glance one sees a young Yahoo Serious, or a Scott \\"Carrot Top\\" Thompson. But no, Heder is more natural, more believable, more absurd, and wonderfully unselfconscious. He is less the over-the-top screamer. In his best moments, like when he played tetherball with himself, or practiced his killer dance moves in his room, he reminded me of some of the great clowns; like a young Jerry Lewis, and even the precursory shadings of the great ones like Jackie Gleason in GIGOT, or Jacques Tati. Heder is Napoleon Dynamite, a prince of Preston, a nerdish Conan out to slay demons, or maybe just to get laid.<br /><br />The setting for the film seems to be the early 1990's. Napoleon, and his older brother, Kip, live with their grandmother, played by Sandy Martin, who does a great turn as a biker grandma, who still dates, eats entirely too much steak, and loves her llama. Aaron Ruell, as the brother Kip, a 32 year old who has been a nerd for so long he is oblivious to it, does a fine job with the role. He lives in front of his computer, logging countless hours in chat rooms, searching for cyber-love, running up huge internet bills. Tina Mjorino, as girlfriend Deb, was wonderfully wacky, off-center, and loveable. A former child star, from films like WATERWORLD, she is 19 years old now, and she is good enough to be slugging it out with the likes of Thora Birch, Jena Malone, and Christina Ricci for those Odd Girl parts. She found the sweet quirkiness and heartfelt honesty of her character. Jon Gries, an actor since 1968, son of famed film director Tom Gries, was very good as the arrogant deluded ignorant Uncle Ricco; a man stuck in the past, reliving a fake fantasy that when he played high school football he might have been a great star, even turned pro...if his stupid coach had not left him on the bench so much. Efrem Ramirez, as Napoleon's best friend, Pedro, is a veteran actor from 10 films. His baby face, and deadpan delivery served him well. He did an excellent job. When he decided to run for class president, against a popular cheerleader, the tempo begins to shift, and we begin to see that this sad and funny drama was going to bend into a kind of fantasy tale; with underdogs rising to the occasion, taking on overwhelming odds, and of course, emerging victorious.<br /><br />In smaller roles we first find Diedrich Baker as the karate teacher Rex, and he is the most seasoned veteran of the cast, having appeared in 33 films. He had a lot of fun with this part, prancing around in his American flag \\"bad-boy\\" pants, and pushing around the local kids while taking their money. Then there is Shondrella Avery appearing as Kip's cyberlove La Fawnduh. She is one hot mama, and she seems to like short skinny white dudes. When Kip boards the bus with her, bandana on his head, glasses in his pocket, suitcases in his hands, leaving home for the first time, we realize the film has come full circle, and now is a fairy tale.<br /><br />I had approached this film skeptically not being sure how I would react or relate to it...but it won me over. It was not just another dumb comedy that would disintegrate two points off my intelligence quotient just by sitting through it.

184195425X|4.0|There are times in \\"The Life of Pi\\" when it seems like someone might not make it.  Initially the casualty might be a reader who gives up after a few chapters of tepid narrative about a gentle Indian boy who grows into adolescence in a family of zookeepers. Pi is benign enough at the outset of the story, but his youthful search for the true religion, and the patchwork solution he arrives at, make for little besides an offhand giggle.  The dangerous urge to put the book down and let the read die prematurely can become overpowering.    But keep at it, and the novel's rewards are plentiful.  Pi's struggle for survival in a lifeboat on the open seas after the demise of the ship carrying his family and their menagerie to a new life in Canada is all the more compelling for how surreal it is.  Author Yann Martel walks a very dangerous line with his authorial approach, requiring the reader to straddle the worlds of possibility and outlandishness without pausing to ask why.  With the combination of poetic yet economic writing and increasingly strong character development, he does more than succeed, he harnesses a gifted author's ability to change perception.    One imagines the open ocean is a wondrous, terrifying place.  Experiencing it with Pi, though, opens up visions most have never before contemplated.  For the most part his journey cleaves to the regular cliches of shipwrecked unfortunates--burning thirst, gnawing hunger, a couple of well placed typhoons, a passing ship that does not stop, a succession of petty but crucial triumphs of will and determination, and finally respite on a deserted island.  But there's a twist to the \\"Life of Pi\\" which adds flavor to the narrative, which, like many acquired tastes, seems simply foreign before becoming intriguing, and then delicious.    Pi is trapped on the lifeboat with the remains of the zoo his family were transporting.  So not only must he deal with the elements at their most vicious, but also with nature at its most unforgiving, in the form of the tiger Richard Parker's maw.  Pi's struggle centers on outwitting, subduing, and ultimately befriending this creature, who shares his odyssey with ever increasing bonhomie, if not trust.  Richard Parker is a larger presence in Pi's miserable journey than any other threat or promise.  When he roars, Pi \\"felt a blast of hot air against my body.  The air visibly shook, like the heat coming off the road on a hot day. I can well imagine that somewhere far off, 150 miles away, a ship's watch looked up, startled, and reported the oddest thing, that he thought he heard a cat's meow coming from three o'clock\\".    Such Alice-in-Wonderland moments abound in \\"The Life of Pi\\", coming to crescendo when Pi and Richard Parker finally beach on an island that may, in fact, be alive itself.  The learning of nature's rules, even as they morph and reform, lies at the heart of the \\"Life of Pi\\".  At the end, the question of the story's authenticity, brought into doubt by Pi's rescuers, seems trite at its core.  That a journey had a beginning and an end and a survivor is all we need to believe in the world.
B0002DB52M|3.0|Lars Von Trier, the 47 old ditsy Danish director, once dubbed the enfant terrible, has placed in the mainstream of celluloid a movie that manages to be anti-film, even as it passes itself off as an artistic endeavor. Was this film a religious allegory, a morality play, or just the germ of an idea that aborted as it came to full term? Yes, came the thunderous reply, and more, and less. But one thing is abundantly clear,\\"Something is rotten in the State of Denmark.\\". Roger Ebert said of this film,\\" Von Trier exhibits the imagination of an artist, but the pendantry of a crank.\\".<br /><br />The choice of a minimalist set, a sparse world for the word play, just so many fat chalk lines and a few assorted props, was far from innovative; rather it was enervative, actually sapping the vigor of the piece and reducing its vitality. Von Trier, a guiding force behind the Dogme Movement, feels that as an artist, it is his job to alienate, to shock, to outrage and to confuse his audience. Like Brecht, he seems hellbent on breaking the illusion that comes from developing feeling for a character. As a writer, he created dialogue that would drive an insomniac crashing into slumber, flat non-sequiturs that lethargically lead from one dead end thought to another.<br /><br />This film outraged me, but oddly, I also treasured the excruciating experience. I was witness to both a travesty and a pivotal form of greatness. Von Trier is so arrogant that he seems to believe that he needs to pummel down the conventions of film, and create a whole new form. But he works fitfully, like a mentally deranged amateur. Actually his premise is a workable one. I just felt that his hubris prevented him from creating something cohesive. His Dogme principles of natural lighting, poorly executed camera angles, and handheld jerky documentarian six o'clock news utilization of his camera, are all leagues short of successful composition or cinematic closure. He shot the film on a sound stage in Copenhagen. A stage, I'm certain that came equipped with state of the art cranes, stedi-cams, gyros, tracks, and mulitiple cameras. Why did he chose to disregard them?<br /><br />A Von Trier film is a virtual netherland of wandering zombies who demand our attention, but who resist our overtures for clarification of thought, plot, and action. His dialogue is flat, preachy, colorless and monotone gray. His actors are forced to mouth it like month-old bread; stale, dry, and tasteless.<br /><br />His cast was a powerhouse, albeit mostly wasted on the mundane material; a whirlwind blend of bankable stars that were willing to take chances for their art, and veteran stars that were just glad to get the work. Nicole Kidman, as Grace, the sacrificial lamb, was very effective. Her role will be memorable, more for its outrageousness than for its integral value or artistic merit. Many of her past performances outshine and eclipse this one. Paul Betteny was appropriately shallow, enigmatic, self-serving and hypocritical as young Tom Edison. Presented at first as a probable protagonist, he emerged quickly as a coward and opportunist. Stellan Skarsgard as Chuck, the cynic hiding in plain sight was very good. His sense of despair was clarion. John Hurt as the narrator who droned on in theatrical tones about the good people of Dogville, seemed to be chorus and godhead in one. I would have liked to have met him incarnate, interacting with the townsfolk, ala OUR TOWN. James Caan as the Big Man, the enforcer, was also very effective, effortless emulating his past roles, creating a solid presence with a minimum of effort. Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Blair Brown, Jeremy Davis, Zeljko Ivanek, and Philip Baker Hall, all were given little to do, so they responded in kind, making barely a ripple in the big pond. Patricia Clarkson was the exception. She was able to wrest an interesting performance from the lameness of the script. Most of the cast were satisfied with underachievement, and they became almost faceless fabric in the weave of the murmering mosaic of townsfolk.<br /><br />This film is worth the watch, if one has the energy, and three hours to spare.the murmering mosaic of townsfolk.

6305718954|2.0|The bath overflows with the pain of no fulfillment spilling across stained tiles, spattering it with the crimson of a time forgotten. The city lights blare through windows that reach into the heavens offering no cover from its tears.    If you like this kind of pretentious garbage conjuring up images that lack any meaning then this film is for you! The film itself does offer an interesting take on church politics (that's why I didn't give it a 1) which has definitely picked up steam as a sub-genre thanks to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", but it loses itself in a war of stylistic nonsense over substance. The cinematography is great, freeze any frame in the film and you'll have an amazing photo but if you cut out most of the emphasis on the rain, dripping ceiling, never ending array of lit candles, car lights cutting through the dark you'd have a much shorter, straight to the point film. I didn't hate all of this, as a matter of fact it did add to the story in a grimy, uncomfortable way (the heavy clothes she wears looks like a burden on her) however, the filmmakers rely so much on it that it becomes a sensory overload that's not worth the payoff. No spoilers about that payoff but when I figured it out midway I wasn't happy that I still had another hour of this to go.

But on the other hand a great album to listen to on the go or while laying on your bed all ready for your siesta. Mr. Radin's soothing voice is perfectly in tune with the music and together they make for some magical tunes.
B0002S65W2|5.0|This movie is so good!!! I don't see how this one bombed at the box office. This movie was so different from your average scary movie movie. It is something we have not seen. It is like a horror/thriller. The acting was great, the movie could have been presented a little bit differently. Other than that it was $10.00 well spent.
B00026W82U|5.0|The solution is pretty easy. Get yourself this album and kick it back on the couch with the top on the lap. Sippin' on some oj. Life seems 10 times easier when you're listening to this album.<br /><br />Oozing voices and calm music that give you the philosophical thrill of a lifetime.
B000GB775E|5.0|This movie was intended for teenagers and it wasn't a bad movie. Its nothing horrible, I would buy it. People write reviews, they haven't seen the movie. They just don't like a person in the movie, which is pointless. If you don't like the actors, then why watch the movie. It was agood movie as i said. But wacth it for yourself.
1401301363|3.0|It's not a bad cookbook.  Entertaining.  Interesting to read about the classic christmas cake and various other stories about her life.  I'm sure the recipes are delicious.  But the author has a very different life, and celebrations, than I do (I can't imagine serving fiddly hot canapes - maybe it's an urban thing) and different tastes (she's heavy on the meat, not so heavy on the spices and strong flavors).  I can't imagine I'll ever make any of these recipes, although some of the cakes and tortes are tempting, if I had extra time and energy on hand... but for real armchair cookbook fantasy, I'd have wanted more pictures.  After the first chapter - on roasting turkey and goose - there's not much that really screams holiday eating at me.
B00000273M|4.0|In the decade that brought us The Go-Go's, Cyndi Lauper and Bananarama, The Bangles were a great group of women who tried to smash the girl-group stereotype by (like [[ASIN:B000001I0O Beauty and the Beat]]) being a fully formed band that wrote their own songs and played their own music. The early EP (not on here and credited as The Bangs) found them on the fringes of the Paisley Underground, and having a distinct Byrds/Beatles infuence. By the first full-length, [[ASIN:B000WZAD4Q All Over the Place]], these influences came into sharp pop-focus. Hoff's ex-boyfriend kiss-off \\"Hero Takes A Fall\\" was an almost hit, while the choice of Kimberly Rew's \\"Going Down To Liverpool\\" was well-apt to their hero's sounds.<br /><br />Obviously, CBS smelled stardom, and smoother sounds on [[ASIN:B00000264B Different Light]] indicated more than a little corporation grooming. Prince had developed a crush on Susanna Hoffs and gave the band \\"Manic Monday,\\" a pitch perfect pop song from an artist at his peak. It became the breakthrough, followed by the zany \\"Walk Like and Egyptian.\\" While Hoffs and Vicki Peterson were writing songs for the album, it was their choice covers that got attention and chart positions. Jules Shears' \\"If She Knew What She Wants\\" is a standout track, as is the pick of Big Star's \\"September Gurls\\" (not here). The first of the big ballads appeared as well, with Michael Steele's \\"Following.\\"<br /><br />However, dispite songwriting contributions from Steele and Peterson and the fact that the harmonies of the Peterson sisters were a big part of The Bangles' sound, the spotlight was becoming more focused on Hoffs. The super-slick [[ASIN:B000WZAD0A Everything]] reflected the pressure CBS put on the band. Number one ballad \\"Eternal Flame\\" was there, surrounded by hyper-synthed 80's production. Oddly enough, the star hit of this period, \\"Hazy Shade of Winter,\\" poured fire into a Simon and Garfunkle song but was only issued on the [[ASIN:B0000024K5 Less Than Zero Soundtrack]] until this best of. Shortly after \\"Everything,\\" the band broke up and Hoffs entered a less than successful solo career.<br /><br />While this CD tends to bypass the more artistically inspired early songs for the slicker pop of the hits, The Bangles were still an ace band. Their choice in writers was impeccable and they had shared writer skills (8 of these songs are band member-written) that are often overlooked. [[ASIN:B00000273M The Bangles' Greatest Hits]] is a solid document of a great pop band, and just as worthy as [[ASIN:B00004T9UN A Go-Go's Collection]] would be.est of.

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|This is a great great great movie. It is for fans of Final Fantasy 7 (FF7). Yes, you should have played it, or seen someone play it before watching this or it won't make sense. This movie provides a resolution to the story that started in FF7. The animation is spectacular, it has fight scenes similar to the fighting scheme in the game, which I think is the best part, and the characters remain true to the game. The only problem with this movie was the story, it was somewhat confusing and a little farfetched (in that it didn't make much sense). Otherwise, this is exactly the kind of movie Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within Should have been.

This album comes with a nice 3D booklet and glasses that might enhance your audio experience with awesome 3D images.  The audio experience is very TOOL specific and this album has a good sound production. I highly recommend it for every TOOL fan ...and not only !
B000002HH9|5.0|It's interesting that everyone who rated this album with one star starts off by first mentioning that they like \\"classic\\" Cure, or that they \\"own all their albums\\". As if that is suppose to create some sort of credibility or classify them as The Cure \\"experts\\". Yet, in their reviews they fail to specifically identify what elements in the alum make it such a \\"bad album\\". The truth is that, as Robert said in an interview, if WMS was The Cure's first album it would be hailed as the best album ever produced.    If you take and listen to WMS at face value without all of these \\"classic cure\\" expectations you will find that the album is musically solid and deep. It is by far one of the top five albums ever produced by The Cure. Anyone who fails to accept that The Cure can be versatile with their music style is not really a fan. If anything they are nothing more than EMO kids of the 80's who never learned how to appreciate Cure music and based all of their taste on pure emotion.      WMS is a great album end to end. The final track \\"Bare\\" is perhaps the most beautiful ending to an album I've heard since... well, since ever.

B000N3ST7A|4.0|Nicely updating [[ASIN:B000002JO6 Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks]], this 2007 Best Of catches up with the music Stevie Nicks has been making since then. Nicks' asset has always been that her dreamy voice meshes so perfectly with her hippy queen image, and allows her to get away with making poetic statements like \\"Edge Of Seventeen\\" or \\"Rhiannon.\\" That hippy image also contrasts sharply with the fact that she could rock pretty hard when she chose to, like on \\"I Can't Wait\\" or the classic duet with Tom Petty, \\"Stop Dragging My Heart Around.\\"<br /><br />Frankly, I doubt that anything I could say here would influence anyone's opinion of Stevie Nicks...so just suffice to say that the remastering of the songs is quite good and a step up from the previous best-of's. The live takes of Fleetwood Mac material are nice additions, and I get a charge out of Nicks' version of Zep's \\"Rock and Roll\\" (although Heart's version tops Stevie's). \\"Leather and Lace\\" remains a highpoint of both Nicks' and Don Henley's musical lives, and the re-working of \\"Dreams\\" is the best \\"new\\" thing on this CD. Add Stevie's personal notes (she loves Jack Black!?!), and this is certainly worth having if you're a fan.
B000ZK4466|5.0|The fact that this band not only exists, but flourishes in the music industry always amazes me....this time around, Omar Rodriguez and co (with the help of friends) dish up a more guitar-oriented, more palatable platter of bizarre, hallucinogenic experimental conceptual music.<br /><br /> A few more \\"hooks\\" and memorable melodic ideas than their last release, \\"Amputechture\\", and a more propulsive, driving percussion style in the driving, quasi-prog rock style of \\"Deloused In The Comatorium\\". More Geddy-Lee-esque shrieking ala Rush's \\"The Temples Of Syrinx\\". More irrational, dreamlike poetic narrative ala William Burroughs meets Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Exceptionally weird artwork. More wondering exactly what the hell is going on. Check it out.
0307387178|5.0|I heard about this book before I ever heard about the movie or the story itself.  Someone mentioned if I ever saw it, to pick it up because they'd heard someone talk about it and felt it would be a great read.  That stuck in my head and when I saw the movie preview, I decided I better read it soon (I make a habit of trying to read the book before I see the movie).  I picked it up along with a few other books and could not put it down.  I read it in every spare second and actually stayed up late one night and got up early, I was so involved in it.  Shocking, because I already knew exactly what was going to happen...but the manner it was written in was so informative and involved.  I learned about so many places and picked up more quotes from authors I love, such as Tolstoy and in general, it is a story of a family.  It is not just the story of Chris McCandless, it is the story of his family dynamic and how it shaped him.  I felt for his family, I felt for him, I felt for all of those who met him and felt such a powerful connection.  I saw the movie about a week after I finished the book and it didn't disappoint either.  It was a bit Hollywood of course, but stayed true to the story for the most part. It was more graphic than I expected in a couple areas and that affected me more than anything.    Krakauer does an amazing job of researching for this book and also  in his defense of Chris against those who were so adamant that he was unprepared and ignorant for venturing into the Alaskan wilderness with the minimal supplies he carried in.  Seriously folks, I don't think most of us would last nearly as long as he did, with the provisions he had.  It was impressive.

B000ZK4466|5.0|The Mars Volta had a tough reputation to keep going for this album after all the stellar releases they'd put out prior to The Bedlam in Goliath, but aside from a few slight flaws they seem to have maintained their quality. The overall sound of the disc is not far from the style found on Amputechture, which has been my favorite album from the band thus far. Even more so than Amputechture it contains abounding wild drumming and haphazard electric guitar sequences which become quickly appealing as part of the overall unchained feel of the CD; oftentimes in each of the louder tracks there will be moments where likely improvised fast-paced guitar playing runs through the background behind the primary chord progressions and gives a deliciously chaotic touch to the melodies, causing the songs to be just noisy enough to be appreciable for their rawness and not cluttered. The vocalist's tone still has its odd high-pitched moments to the point where it sounds at times like he has inhaled helium, but this has always added a strangely interesting edge to the band which adds unique singing to its already notably unique instrumental portions. Not much has changed on this album as far as how the band sounds, although a lack of style progression is almost fitting for the Mars Volta since they already seem to have cultivated a flawless, original sound;  there are still justifiably long songs, catchy sound effects, and extremely well-crafted song structures just like all the other releases. I instantly was able to appreciate a few of the tracks featured on The Bedlam in Goliath as all-time favorites from the band, the main one being \\"Goliath\\". With about four different phases of equally praiseworthy chord progressions carrying this song through its seven-minute length, this jam has both some of the catchiest lyrics on the CD (i.e. \\"Never heard a man speak like this man before\\") and most of the greatest riffs, along with an excellent build-up halfway through which consists of initially quiet drums and bass before diving into a rough wild electric-guitar mode. \\"Metatron\\" would be my second favorite, with crazy electric guitar zipping all over the place in the background in an unstructured form almost reminiscent of freeform jazz applied to rock music. There were no noticeably weak tracks in my opinion, although the closing two tracks did seem to have slightly less appeal than the preceding songs on the album. Overall this album is continuing to grow me with multiple listens, just as all of the Mars Volta's past albums have done. At this point I would rate it four and a half stars, and would only criticize it for seemingly being the first album from the band to break the chain in my tendency to enjoy each Mars Volta album more than the one before it. The first half of the CD also seems to outshine the second half, but all in all The Bedlam is Goliath is great and certainly not a letdown. Highly recommended.

B000051NT1|4.0|This is an \\"edited\\" version of a multi-CD set of the complete show. I am not as critical on that point, since some fans may not want to invest a multi-set for whatever reason.<br /><br />The performances is of the band about one month after the release of its first studio album - The Doors - but months before the controversial appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, which set pop culture on fire. This is as essential as - for example - The Beatles - Live In Hamburg, 1962 - since it chronicles an important band at a point before it became trapped in the destructive elements of international rock stardom.<br /><br />When everything clicked, The Doors was as great a live band as any from the 1960s. This club gig shows why.

B000K15VSA|5.0|I was really pleased with all of the additional items in this edition and their tie-in to the film/s, especially the metalic looking plastic case, diecast police vehicle and the silver painted plastic unicorn.  The contents are all securely incased in foam packaging within the case, which was a pleasant surprise.  The different versions of the movie are as good as you would expect them to be, although I am still no clearer to understanding the significance of the unicorn.  I ordered this from the UK because it was actually cheaper, at the time, than ordering the UK version of this special edition, which was basically just the DVD's.  Having said that, and to be objective, my wife doesn't understand why I wanted all of the extra bits when the DVD box set was the only important thing...but it's fun to feed your inner child periodically!
0525950079|3.0|This book is an instant replay of \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" - new names, different century. Not a bad story but it can get tedious at times. As historical fiction goes, it isn't bad, either. It's just never - ending. Enjoy it as good storytelling on a long winter's eve.

Check out G-Sides, also, if you like their remixes.

The two stars have great chemistry, I have seen this film so many times and it is still a treat after all these years. Directed by Ron Howard, Splash continues to entertain even though the premise is far-fetched, definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the '80s. I highly recommend this joyful film.

The ending was retarded. I get why one or two ppl might feel hopeless but the whole group after fighting so hard to survive?? Whatever. This movie would have been better if it had any ending but this one. And whats up with guys acting in the last scene? Talk about forced. All in all this movie was worth the watch but I doubt i'll be adding it to my personal collection. Looking for a movie that actualy entertains or tells a story not this obvious rehash or stuff for shock value...I can get that from Jerry Springer.
B000P2A256|5.0|I would say that it's a real good CD, they stayed true to form. Much faster tempo that the last CD. Great lyrics in my opinion. Worth buying since it's been awhile since their last CD. They just keep getting better!    Great service from Amazon, received the CD in a couple of days.
0793518326|5.0|Sure there is an occasional typo(like every book I`ve ever owned) but the scope of information and work put in this volume is staggering, especially considering the price.This is no piano lead sheet arrangement book like The Complete Beatles Book.You get vocal harmonies,real bass lines and lead guitar parts plus a lot of George Martin`s horn and orchestral parts.Don`t even waffle if you are a musician who is also a Beatles fan.This is THE BOOK to get.
0143038419|5.0|Eat, Pray, Love really took me by surprise.  A friend gave it to me for Christmas and I admit that my first thought was \\"Oh, another book by someone I never heard of about the meaning of life.\\"  But I took it home with me.  I became so engrossed in it that I almost missed opening presents on Christmas morning.  And I am into Christmas.      Elizabeth Gilbert is certainly a gifted writer.  There are many ways in which she and I are different (she's an intelligent, beautiful, sophisticated New Yorker and I am not, although we are both mammals), but as I read her work I kept having \\"That's me!\\" moments when she would express a thought I didn't think anyone but me had ever had, or reacted to people or circumstances exactly the way I think I would.  My point is not that the book is great because I could identify with it; my point is that Gilbert's writing is so accessible and her experiences and needs so universal that I think anyone will be able to recognize them and to enjoy and learn from the ways she deals with them.      She begins by telling how a personal crisis led to an unexpected spiritual experience and how that motivated her to change her life through, among other things, extensive foreign travel.  There's more humor, food, and discussion of sex (nothing at all explicit)than is usual in books that spend so much time discussing relationships with God and other people and more discussion of God and human relationships than is usual in books this funny.  There is, in other words, something for everyone.  The extent to which you don't think you need this book is probably the extent to which you do.
B000ZK4466|2.0|If you could listen to De-Loused, Frances, and Amputechture all consecutively with very little or no interruption, You might have trouble with this one.<br /><br />First off, I'm not OMG TEH BIGGEST FANBOI of TMV; I do not own any of their T-shirts, I have not seen them live and I don't have \\"THE MARS VOLTA\\" tatooed across my back. But when I first heard De-Loused, I felt as if I was 10 and listening to Iron Maiden's \\"Powerslave\\" for the first time. When Amputechture came out, I had rushed to the store and bought it with Frances The Mute, and they're 2 very great albums. Before you know it, I had become a huge fan. I consider Amputechture to be their finest moment to date, and I couldn't believe that they were releasing another album. I could listen to all 3 albums consecutively without very little or no interruption.<br /><br />So on the day that The Bedlam in Goliath came out, I rushed to the mall and bought it at the record store. On a first listen, I thought it was pretty good, but something just didn't seem right. It wasn't until I had listened to their previous 3 again that I discovered the problem(s) with this:<br /><br />1. There are more Saxophone solos in the first 10 songs of the album than ANY OF THE OTHER 3 ALBUMS COMBINED!!!!! Don't get me wrong, I think the saxophonist is very talented, but he's no jazzman. The solos are very unneccessary and unemotional.<br /><br />2. All the songs sound the same, with the exception of \\"Cavelettas\\" and \\"Ouroborus\\", which sounds like a mix of \\"Drunkship of Lanterns\\" and \\"Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of)\\". There just isn't anything dynamic about this album! Yeah, they used more sound effect machines, who cares? They aren't used well. The only thing remotely dynamic was the guitar-vs-saxophone part towards the end of \\"Aberinkula\\"<br /><br />3. Thomas Pridgen. OK, maybe it's because he's new to the band, but I didn't find one single memorable drum lick on this album. Sure, not every drum part has to sound like Jon Theodore, but please. He could at least not solo every 30 seconds of each song.<br /><br />So what DID I like about this album? Well, Aberinkula is catchy, Ilyena is cool, Cavelettas and Ouroborus are also cool, Cedric sounds amazing, and the band are playing tightly. Still worth a listen. In a way I'm glad I own this since like a lot of my other fave bands, I'll buy their albums to complete the collections, but yeah. TMV can do better.every 30 seconds of each song.    So what DID I like about this album? Well, Aberinkula is catchy, Ilyena is cool, Cavelettas and Ouroborus are also cool, Cedric sounds amazing, and the band are playing tightly. Still worth a listen.

1401322336|4.0|It sounds ridiculous, but there's really something to be said for a picture on every page. The recipes in this book are for simple, un-intimidating, beautiful food. Everything we've made so far has been delicious.
B00000F169|5.0|This cult classic from the 70's is a tongue-in-cheek science fiction spoof.  It's also one of the lowest budget productions I've ever seen (the \\"alien\\" is a beachball.  No kidding - a real beachball!)  The animations are intentionally unrealistic - reminiscent of some of the worst early Star Trek animations - but charming for the same reason. The \\"action\\" is a bit slow which adds to the effect.  I loved this movie when I saw it in the 70's and it's great to see it back on DVD.  Highly recommended for those with a warped enough sense of humor.
B000XCZGV8|4.0|I really enjoyed the zodiac and the director's cut is certainly the way to go if you enjoyed it too. However, I really bought this for the extra features. I was disappointed. Nice featurettes, interesting interviews, but not as many as they could have done. If you liked the movie and want a little more info, this is for you. If you've already read Zodiac Unmasked + other books on the killings, the bonus features aren't very insightful or well organized.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|This shortlived series is as relevent today as it was 15 years ago.  I have been watching it with my 15 year old daughter and it is amazing how much she can relate to the characters.  I, too, at age 48 can totally relate to the issues of High School, who to be friends with, how to be who you are and who you want to be, parents, kids, spouse, life...  I loved this series when it first came out - and still love it today.
B000L212HW|5.0|Truly an awesome disc with numerous short flix included and what with the voiceover you can spend 8 hours on this disc alone without getting bored. The dragons in BR are phenomenal to witness, as real as it gets. Considering how little BR discs actually cost for what you get this disc is a tremendous bargain and how excellent to see such a high quality dragon flic anyway.  It's also great to see Gerard Butler before 300 fame in a scene-stealing cameo part. Bale is balefully brave and Matthew M is fantastic as the rogue marine dragon killer. He's never been better. All in all well worth every penny !
0452286751|5.0|this a very good book to read if you are thinking about becoming an architect
B00013RC8O|3.0|I only watched this movie based on Tarantino's mentioning it so much in Death Proof.  It had some good car action, but the plot was pretty bad, the DJ was annoying and the ending wasn't very good.
0810994739|5.0|Absolutely delightful. All our kids, especially the 9 year old just love this 'series'. It is just so funny. Great to encourage kids to read!
B0007TKNKG|5.0|This is a great 80's action flick. Stallone saving his kid and doing what he loves is just great.  The action is great, the arm wrestling tournament has some great characters and scenses.  The names used were great as well: Hudson Hawk, Bull Hurley, John Grizzly, Mad Dog Madison, just great names.  The only bad thing is the kid gets annoying, but the rest of the movie overcomes this.
B00007KWHG|1.0|I purchased 2 copies of Frankie Valli.  The quality of both of them was extremely poor, to the point I could not understand either of them after the first 3- 5 numbers.  Amazon was excellent in crediting me for the purchase.  I need to add that all other Amazon purchases have been very satisfactory.
1594489505|5.0|I enjoyed this more than \\"The Kite Runner\\".  I started reading it on a Thursday night and finished it Friday evening. Where the Kite Runner came from the view of a male growing up in war torn Afghanistan, this book exemplifies the true horrors women faced.
037582913X|5.0|WE love grover and the fact that he was afraid of himself makes this book timeless
0375842381|4.0|I know that the release of the movie must have aroused your interest in theese books. I bought the books after the movie release as well. This package is of all three(3) books in a hard case. looks really nice as an addition to your books and the reading itself is easy and enthralling.   a Good and worthy purchase.
B00008DDRX|5.0|Plot?  Who needs a plot?    This is about one of the greatest sports car races and one of the greatest battles of prototypes in sports car history, the Porche 917 and the Ferarri 512M.    The racing scenes are spectacular and the movie is more interesting if you know the stories behind the making of the film.    It is a must for true racing fans.    Sit back and turn up the volume.
B000A2IPPK|4.0|ET is a very good movie.  Although sad, it has good moral lessons for young people.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This is a great look at how Formula One used to be.  If you're an old school racing fan, this movie is a must.  The racing on the circuits like Monaco and Spa are unbelievable.  You also get to see racing greats like Graham Hill, Jochen Rindt, Jo Bonnier, Bob Bondurant, Phil Hill.    Sadly, I found myself looking at the various scenes and going, \\"He's gone, he's gone,...\\"    I recommend this movie, LeMans, and The Speed Merchants for any racing fan.
B00004SVGE|3.0|Indicated \\"DVD-Audio\\" on here  But this disc is DTS-CD    DTS-CD is playable all standard CD player  and play back 5.1 surround sound with A/V receiver  That's it , That all , nothing more    DVD-Audio is better than DTS-CD of course  High sampling sound and multiple sound options , Lyrics ,   add video and more    Once again  This is DTS-CD

0307277887|3.0|It is an entertaining book and a quick read.  Other than the main character, Dexter, the book is lack of development of other characters. It seems like Deborah, the sister of Dexter's vocabulary is extremely limited only to profanity, nor does she have the intelligence or abilities to solve any crimes by herself as a detective (and the whole Miami Police Department) without Dexter's \\"special hunches\\".  The TV show is so much better than the book on story and character development.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Magic is my first new Springsteen purchase in years.  I still listen to him on tape!    I really love the final, untitled song on the disk - classic Springsteen at its finest.    A very good CD and well worth the money.  It seems Springsteen has gone back to his roots and produced a CD in the same musical style as his earlier projects.
B001152TL6|5.0|This was my introduction into David Lynch and I was totally blown away.  Bought it on Laserdisc, the last decent release in the US.  Instead of a DVD I wish they would give it a proper release on Blu-Ray or HD-DVD so that we don't have to wait for an HD release like we have had to wait for a decent release on DVD.
B001041JLE|5.0|The King is back. The King of Pop is back with another CD and it has remixes. I am so excited and yes, Michael, for the fans, can you come out with some new stuff for your fans...PLEASE!!!! and do a tour too, PLEASE!!!! Michael you really are the King of Pop and that will never ever ever ever ever change.
0765318741|5.0|You know when Steven King praises a novel (that he didn't write) it's probably pretty good!  This one is excellent.  Not too long, but long enough to make its points.  One of the books I've remembered from my youth and wanted to read again so I went ahead and bought a copy -- expecting perhaps that it hadn't held up well over time.  It has.  Very fun to re-read.  I highly recommend it!

1933784032|5.0|I have seen products tied to the Star Wars franchise, but this book is a serious work. It documents the model workshop and its creations with investigative attention to detail. The format of the book and its layouts are designed with professional care, that reflects the care of the model makers. There are production and model shots followed by large fold outs that reveal detail that one can only see at the museum exhibits. And the book is gargantuan in proportion. It took me a whole afternoon to browse the pages. Now, I am reading the text --which is fascinating. Not a flip book, but a substantial work. This is the best translation into book format, the phenomenon that is called Star Wars by far. I higly recommend it as a design historian and a visual communication professor--as well as a fan of avant garde cinema.
140120306X|4.0|This is a quite good book. Not as good as the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Volume One, but good nonetheless. I love all the references to 1950's British culture especially all the little hidden thigs like the Giles cartoons granny at the start waving her umbrella at the cars.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Wanting to use a film adaptation of Austen's novel in a college literature course, I had several choices, including a more recent PBS adaptation. This version (with Amanda Root)seems much more accurate to me--the scene between Capt Harwick and Anne wherein they debate men's vs women's fidelity and ways of loving remains towards the end with Wentworth overhearing it (whereas in the recent PBS version the conversation occurs between Benwick and Anne in Lyme). Also, Root portrays Anne Elliot as a more mature and maturing woman, yet one who reveals strong emotions (her surprise at encountering WEntworth, for instance)with a great deal of subtlety and dignity (unlike the PBS version which has Anne Elliott running up and down the streets of Bath, unescorted, breathlessly searching for Wentworth). Finally, this version (the one with Amanda Root)incorporates lavish cultural detail--candelabras attached to music stands, for instance, to remind the viewer that all was not (fluorescently) illuminated during the Regency era.
B0001US8FI|4.0|Enter The Dragon is in a class all its own.<br /><br />Bruce...we salute you!
B000YXMMAE|3.0|In terms of Radiohead albums, I think this may be a regression. In my opinion, Radiohead has gotten progressively better with each subsequent release. I think \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is still the musical pinnacle for Radiohead. \\"In Rainbows\\" is a great album and highly enjoyable, but not as great previous releases.
B000XCZGV8|4.0|I heard/read so much positives about this movie that I had to Buy it, even without first seeing it at the theater.  Luckily I heard about a 2-disc Directors' Cut coming out when I was first thinking of buying, so I waited til this past month (Jan 08') to snag it.  Robert Downey Jr. is very good as the been there/done that/Drank That somewhat Veteran reporter who gets involved in the case early on when the Letters from the Killer are mailed to his (along with a few others) newspapers editor.  Jake Gyllenhal is the papers' cartoonist who is into word puzzles and the like, who is the main character pretty much in the movie.  The Location shooting, the great sets, pretty much all the supporting cast, the period clothing/cars, etc., are all spot on.  You think you're back in the late 60's, early 70's in the Frisco' area.  If you're looking for a movie with a lot of killing or many, this is not that movie.  They show a few, and how they might have played out based on the evidence and a few eyewitness reports, but the jist of the story is the killers notes to the police and the various attempts to track him down with the little evidence found.  At about 2 hrs & 40 minutes or so, it is a Long movie, that I personally didn't felt dragged at all really, though some will beg to differ.  It's a very very involved and detailed story and to gloss over major happenings would be an injustice to the storyline to save 20-30 mins of movie time.  I'm sure it could have been 3+ hrs and prob. was well over that, before trimming began anyway!  I say if you want to see whole story with many extras (Dir. Commentary, some documentary type stuff on the whole story itself, deleted scenes) you have to get the 2-disc Directors' Cut.  If you just want to watch the movie, then get the regular version I guess.  I found it a great movie and since it came out earlier in 2007, unfortunately overlooked for some Oscar consideration.  Robert Downey Jr could have easily got a Best Supp. Actor nod, Jake G.perhaps a Best Actor Nom., and Chloe Sevigny a Supp Actress nom. as well.  Director David Fincher Def. should have rec'd a Best Director bid for his work here.
0143038419|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful. Gilbert takes you on her magical journey to find harmony in her life. It is funny, endearing, inspiring and just down right addictive. It's a pure delight and a book that I will always treasure.

B000YENUI6|4.0|I saw this film at the movie theatre and had to have it when it came out on DVD.
078322740X|4.0|Seriously I dont even remember the first or the last time I saw this movie...I think I was still a kid,at home watching it with my parents.  Steve Martin & Goldie Hawn make a good and very funny couple onscreen.  My dad was sooooo happy watching this movie again that he watched it 2 times straight.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I've seen plenty of film versions of this story and I have to say that this is probably my favorite. Ruth Wilson is perfect as Jane--alternately serious and mischevious, with great expression in the eyes. She's obviously been made to look plainer than she is, because in the scenes where she is supposed to 'blossom', she certainly does, just by having her hair down or lighting her a bit differently. My mom said it best I think: \\"The more I look at her, the more I think that she is just the cutest duck I've ever seen.\\" And, as for Mr. Rochester, this film version's is my absolute favorite. Toby Stephens (son of Dame Maggie Smith, by the way) does an excellent job of depicting the changeable Edward Fairfax Rochester; he's brooding, charming, handsome, teasing...just the perfect dark hero, and his onscreen chemistry with Jane (Ruth Wilson) hints at the passion that underlines this story--something I find is missing from other versions.    As a quick con, there is one bit of digital enchancement/editing--a rainstorm and the symbolic lightning strike of a tree that Jane and Rochester had been standing under--that doesn't quite flow with the rest of the film--sort of like when you notice something's been shot using bluescreen--but it's a tiny moment and overall this is a wonderful film version of a classic story.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|I've picked the DVD box up and turned it over at least ten times since the DVD release of Once. Finally I rented it.<br /><br />Once is not a film for mere observers looking for light-hearted entertainment. Instead it's one of those movies that requires an emotional connection. Unless you regularly watch foreign films, you might want to tread carefully because this film is very typical of the slower story telling pace. If you are looking for a love story and a date movie, you are likely to be disappointed. But if you love fragments of reality in literature, art and song, you may find Once very fulfilling.<br /><br />Once is a character study of two lonely people, both heart-broken in love, and by life. It's almost as if the camera follows them documentary-style through the humdrumness of their lives. But they spark as they connect over shared dreams -- music.<br /><br />There is a poignant heaviness that colors the film a little drab. The song lyrics weave brokeness through simple folksy flavored acoustic melodies.<br /><br />If you aren't certain, rent it before buying. Read all the reviews. If you hated Lost in Translation or didn't get it, Once isn't for you. If you hate dialogue, normal activities of daily living and little action, this movie is not for you. But if you seek the human condition and delight in rekindled dreams, check it out.<br /><br />One warning. It's rated R for language and the F-bomb is frequent flyer. Usually it makes cluster appearances during tense scenes rather than being peppered throughout.
0452282152|4.0|This good book took me back to times long ago when life was so very different. It had a very good story line. However, toward the end it got off track and the plot was lost for a while. Because of the ending I gave the book a 4 star rating. Pity really as with a little more care at the end the author could have had a classic on her hands.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|My husband and I played the previous version of this game and immediately wanted our own to play!  The game is challenging and ever-changing (within individual games and with every new game started) which keeps it from getting old.  The gameboard pieces are sturdy with vibrant graphics.  After playing this edition multiple times, I'm still not sure if I like the \\"frame\\" in which the land pieces are set (which I believe to be the only physcial change from the previous edition) because it doesn't sit flat when put together.  It doesn't impede in playing the game, but it is annoying so we usually put coasters around the edge to hold it flat.  Time is also a factor...our games take about 3 hours on average to complete.  We also bought the 5-6 player extension which we use quite often--it includes more land pieces, cards, and player pieces.
0803729227|5.0|My youngest grandson loved this book. Very well written with exciting parts for young children and a good story line. 5 star rating well deserved.
055358202X|3.0|Put me in the minority of folks who like \\"A Feast for Crows,\\" but don't love it.  I like the sort of anti-fantasy grimness, and many of the characters (especially the Lannisters) are amongst the most memorable in fantasy lit.  However, I don't like the way plotlines never really close.  I suppose you can say that plotlines in real life don't close either, but I find it artistically dissatisfying to invest in Martin's creations, only to find the characters' destinies tossed out as throwaway lines during a treatment of a different character.  Especially if you start the books from the beginning, with \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" the effect is more dizzying than enjoyable, really.    All that said, there's much to like, and too much fantasy fiction cheats us out of real characters and a sense that the world is more than just a battle of abstractions such as Light and Dark.  Martin's universe is richer, and I'll be there for the next book, but I'd advise anyone who wants their stories to have beginnings and endings--happy, sad, or otherwise--to beware before buying.
0143038419|2.0|I enjoyed the authors writing style, however I found this book irksome.  Gilbers's writing is down to earth but she was ever so whiney throughout the book.  I found her selfish and self-absorbed.  The best part of this book is the title.

I still cannot decide whether I liked this novel better than the first, though many of my female friends did.<br />I was worried that it would be too similar to the first novel, but I didn't find this to be true at all.  It was touching and sad, but delievered a consistently good read.

B0002IQEHI|1.0|If I had something to review, I would, but we received three different copies of the DVD and they all failed at the same spot (Scene 31).  The sound keeps going, but the Video froze.

159562015X|1.0|A couple of words of warning:<br /><br />First, the Web site that goes with this book (and which contains the all-important \\"strengths\\" test the book is geared around) is quite buggy - lots of user complaints on the related forum, plus my own experience was an unhappy one - when I completed the test I was abruptly transferred back to the logon page, where I found that I was completely locked out - my old password was dead and I couldn't create a new password that worked.<br /><br />Second, the \\"report\\" generated by the test was weak and inane. It identified not strengths but only some of my work habits - far from being the same thing. The suggestions at the end of the report were likewise tepid.<br /><br />In short I would suggest this book is big on hype, low on useful information. I see all the glowing reviews and can only wonder at them.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This dvd in my opinion is like watching straight from the concert itself. I was very lucky to attend her farewell performance concert in Houston.

Think of it as the beginning of a long, strange archeological dig.  Hear The Premiers' \\"Farmer John\\" today & find yourself searching out the out-of-print 45rpm tomorrow.  $40 for (4) discs?  Yes, please!
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|My uncle had been wearing the Seiko SKX007 (although his may be a different model number) since the early 80s. I was a little kid back then and I may not have consciously noticed his watch, But his watch must have left some impact, because I've always been partial to divers watches, and currently own several. These include two quartz Bulovas, one quartz Swatch, and most recently an automatic Omega Seamaster Professional (the James Bond model). The Bulovas were OK, the Swatch is a piece of garbage, and the Omega is just a delight to own.    And yet, none of these ever seemed to match my mind's idealized image of what a divers watch should be.    A short time after buying the Omega, I came across the Seiko on some watch aficionado website. I recognized it as the watch my uncle has worn all these years and was surprised to realize that this very watch was the image against which I judged all other diver watches. I wanted it badly. But having just spent a bundle on a watch I couldn't justify the purchase.    Until  the end of December. Out of nowhere, my not-a-year-old Omega started gaining close to an hour a day!! A bizarre circumstance followed by an immediate delivery to the local Omega authorized dealer. It would take nearly a month until my watch was repaired and returned.     What's a guy to do? I knew .... I went to Amazon and bought the Seiko I always wanted. An automatic and the less expensive model; the pricier model has square number markers, not circles.    Always the pessimist, I prepared myself for disappointment. I hadn't seen my uncle's watch for some time and just expected a let down of some sort. I was concerned the face would just look radically different from what I hoped for, and I'd be stuck with a watch I didn't want to wear.  And despite my fears, I kept heading to the window all morning on the day the watch was scheduled to arrive.     Finally, the UPS truck pulled up in front of my house and sure enough, he was holding my new \\"replacement\\" watch. I opened the box and out came the watch I always wanted --- looking and feeling exactly as I had wished.    Now I regularly alternate between my $2000 Omega and my $200 Seiko. It keeps perfect time! It is aesthetically fantastic! And it just feels great on my wrist! It is big, and the rubber band is not elegant. But 'not elegant' in the sense that it looks out of place when I wear it with a suit. But in any other situation, it looks just right.    Here are some observations: The face is beautiful. The band is thick and rugged, the antithesis of cheap or flimsy. The luminescence stays luminescent for hours into the dark. The automatic second hand sweep is graceful and solid. The case is unbrushed steel, substantial in weight, and heavy-duty like industrial strength machinery. The top of the lugs are brushed steel and the contrast only enhances the watch's natural good looks. The screw-down crown is BIG and has deep grooves, which makes it easy to screw and unscrew, not to mention set.    The bezel is my favorite feature because the grooves on the side are designed for serious use. If you want to turn that unidirectional bezel, be assured -- it will not slip. The watch is so solid that you can only conclude that conventional opinion, at least someone still makes it like they used to.    For balance, I'll mention the one and only aspect of the watch that I would prefer were different. You cannot stop the second hand. Even as you're setting the time, the second hand continues to move, making it impossible to perfectly synchronize the watch with an atomic clock. Then again, hopefully not everyone is like me, and has to have a perfectly synchronized watch.    To conclude, obviously I highly, highly recommend the Seiko SKX007. Keep in mind: if hard-core diver watches are NOT your thing, you may quickly realize that this watch is way too much watch to handle. But if you're a diver watch lover like me -- even if, like me, you've never worn a wet suit in your life -- thiswatch is as much the real deal as you'll ever get.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers is still the funniest series ever produced.  The cast was perfect, the scripts crisp, action-packed and hilarious, and the situations were totally believable. John Cleese is a master of physical and verbal comedy, with the remarkable goose-step, the thrashing of the mini, the manhandling of Manuel, the spasmodic jerks and jumps - one can go on and on.  The rest of the cast is perfect and fantastics, but Cleese is the pivotal character in the mix.  His unctious, obsequiousness to those perceived to be in the upper class and drop-dead rudeness to everyone else is one of key elements of action at Fawlty Towers.      There was an attempt to translate the series to the US in a version starring Diana Rigg.  This series followed in the steps of several other British series with less than likeable main characters coming to the US with great success (Sanford & Son, All in the Family).  The series lasted through several episodes which were straight re-writes of the original.  The move from male to female lead did not work, and the emphasis on class differences necessary to the British version did not play in the States.    I am not going to list the episodes or heap masses of praise - others have done that.  I am going to tell you about my favorite episode - the Anniversary Party - where the normally obnoxious Basil tries to plan a surprise party for his wife, gets her so mad at him by pretending to have forgotten the event that she leaves, forcing him to resort to a small lie to placate the arriving guests.  This lie balloons with each arrival, until Basil is forced to hire Polly, the maid, to impersonate his wife.  In this episode you actually wind up feeling sorry for Basil, who, though hoist by his own petard, is doing what he thinks is best for good reasons with very bad results.    The episodes in this series are so tightly written that several of them actually seem like two separate episodes in terms of action (the concussion/fire alarm is a prime example).    This series is the best ever made.  It can be watched again and again and again.  If you have not discovered the joys of Fawlty Towers and its dysfunctional staff, rush out an rent or buy.
B00004R9A4|5.0|Great communication! DVD was well packed and the movie was exactly as described. It was a pleasure doing business with Amazon, and I look forward for the opportunity to purchase more items in the very near future.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|If you are a Rainbow fan from the beginning then this is a must buy.

B000777J2S|5.0|Product as described, price excellent, timely delivery.<br />What recording company fool decided to put Antony in the \\"Easy Listening\\" category?! Sure, his amazing voice is easy to listen to, but this is NOT elevator music. The band is tight, Antony's voice is flawlessly on pitch and totally original. Forget what you've read about comparisons to other singers, he's got his own style and swing. Great for jazz lovers (and I'm one), altie fans and anyone with an ear for unusual, adventuresome virtuosity.

0446577391|5.0|This is the first book I've read from David Baldacci, but I'm planning to read more of his stories.  This was a fun read.  All the characters have flaws, but some of them are trying to take steps to fix previous mistakes they've made in life.      I admit that I don't have a lot of knowledge into the tactics of the CIA, and other secret operation groups within the government, so I don't know how realistic all of this is.  With that being said, I found it interesting and very easy to follow.     I had a very hard time putting down this book.  I'm certainly going to read the Camel Club (the first book in this series).  I'm hoping that book is as good as this one.
0553278398|5.0|My book scale goes like this: 1-poor, 2-fair, 3-excellent. A 3. I read this in high school & now, couple years later, I'm back into it.    It's a great book for any sci-fi fan, esp. ones who like the future. I always wonder what happens next, and I also constantly visualize seeing what's going on in my imagination. The places they visited had unique settings and dialogue. To me, that makes for excellent material.    Oh, it's worth collecting, too. :)
B000002UB3|5.0|Timeless CD.  Every song in this album is great and you will not regret investing in this CD.
B000OLGCI4|3.0|I am a bit disappointed with Amazon.  The movie and case are fine, but it didn't come with a slip cover that all of the copies have in the stores. It was more convenient for me to place an order with Amazon, but if I'd known they wouldn't be including the nice anniversary edition slipcover one-- I would have bought it at Target as it was the same price.
0143038419|5.0|A delightful and inspirational account of one woman's path to heart.  Ms. Gilbert is witty, passionate and easily brings the reader into the moment in all of the moments of her very interesting year in Itally, India and Indonesia.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Didn't see it in the movies but picked it up on VHS back in the late 1980s--even used it for a Public Policy graduate paper in the early 1990s.  However, until I got the 4 DVD set and watched the digitally enhanced version was I totally blown away again.  And, as good as the movie was, the production story was even better.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...
B000V6BE6M|5.0|again, Howard Shore does not disappoint. amazing music- 4 cd's worth. the music is so soothing, and I love when King Elessar sings in Numenorian at the end, and Pippen's song to the Steward of Gondor...amazing
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This movie contains everything - great acting, spiritual truths, morality, realism, faithfilled, love inspiration, humor, entertaining, educational.  What else could you want!  What a life this man lead and there is so much that we can learn from him - Praise be to God!    Good for Catholics and non-Catholics alike
B000E8QVWY|2.0|you're sadly mistaken and duped. Oh, why don't I like this film, it's  because what happens is a train wreck and without the energy and emotion to make it palpable.  I respect both of the actors and the director as well as Cash and his wife, but this film makes the worst compromises. It sacrifices genuine moments of joy in his life for muted paraphrases of them. Film is an emotional medium in terms of storytelling and you can't tell a biopic with it. Often biopics are inaccurate because of this and it seems this one has the reverse problem, they made a dull movie because they didn't want to be accused of sensationalism. That \\"d word\\" in the last sentence sums up this movie just fine. It's dull from start to finish, it never takes off and it finishes in a way that makes even the biggest supporter of it think \\"that's it\\"  or even possibly \\"well, it had to end sometime\\" or even ludicrously, \\"I thought they were going to cover the later years when he did that cover of \\"hurt\\".\\" I can't think of one reason for this movie even existing except for the fact they were cashing in on the bandwagon of people who became fans when the media made a deserved tribute to him when he died. It's possibly and even likely that Cash's life is worthy of dramatization, but what's shown here isn't worth the trouble.  It's not terrible because of the performances, but the performances feel like composites instead of authentic portrayals. I hated that and also hated the fact that I knew there were better actors for these roles as well as better stories to tell. They just seem depressed and without energy throughout. Just to state the obvious: this film is a downer even if the ending is somewhat victorious.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|The graphics on the Tin can that all this came is is beautiful.  The packaging of the robot could be better, his antenna was broken......not good on a collectable item......everything else was great.
B000002KAT|5.0|I almost don't want to explore any of Van's other work because of the one-two knockout of this and Moondance.  They perfectly compliment each other and show a musician and songwriter moving from one style to another and remaining distinctive. Most of the songs are pondering, winding, elegant, and slow.  The only song that isn't is \\"the way young lovers do.\\" It's a short tracklist with a number of long songs, but if you have the patience to actually listen to the music and live with it, you'll see that it's all beautiful with great songs, no filler, no fair, or even decent songs, just great ones. They also aren't songs (largely) of the radio variety so it may take some time to appreciate if you aren't into stuff this speed (uhum uhum, new york dolls?) This album isn't full of pop songs, so for that you can go somewhere else, but for those who can see the obvious value in it, will an album that's much more rewarding than many pop masterpieces.
159562015X|4.0|I originally bought this book for a course I was taking, and after the class have found myself still skimming through it from time to time.  It's not a book that's really intended to be read straight through, but once you find your \\"Top Five\\", it's incredibly informative to read what makes you tick.  Let's face it, narcissistic as we are, who doesn't like to read about themselves?
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I believe this cumulative film \\"Grindhouse\\" was an exciting adventure and idea, but this film isn't good. What's most troublesome is that the film is filled with good actors and things just aren't working out. QT alienates people from the films he says he loves in this film by calling them out and then providing a film that vastly underperforms and fails to live up to the mold. I believe I read an interview with him about this film in which he describes the other film as a straighahead zombie movie, whereas this one is a \\"more complicated hybrid\\" of the chase thriller. Ahem, no this isn't a complicated genre, Quentin, you just have to clutter up a simple structure with your pointless dialogue and that makes it \\"complicated\\" and \\"bad.\\" The thing that really makes this film's demise worse is that the beginning isn't all that bad and the sequences featuring Kurt Russell are actually very good, but when he's not onscreen and we have to play the \\"we're going to learn all about these girls and their lives\\" setup game, it completely throws off the momentum of the film. Frankly, he's used the random mundane dialogue in the past and it comes off as endearing, but here it doesn't work because we're both expecting and not expecting it. Previously it worked because the characters otherwise had a bite to them and were interesting, or the things they said were an odd juxtaposition to their occupation (Pulp Fiction).  Here we have four women who are everyday women, they have mundane jobs on a film set, save for the one who can't act, and they talk about the most mundane things imaginable. There's no setup to the plot with these women, they seem conspicously separate from the rest of the movie and that's the problem, there's no connection or intrigue as to why Stuntman Mike chooses them, they're just completely random. The first group of girls, although still a bit yawn-inducing at least had some intrigue prompting their inclusion. We never get that with these women and it feels like most of the film is about them. Also, we don't truly believe that Stuntman Mike wouldn't be able to kill them, it really seems as if he's been doing this awhile and knows how to be efficient.     QT does telegraph the fact these women won't be dying with his inclusion of a character played by a female stuntwoman with the implication being that Stuntman Mike can only kill women who don't know how to play it safe, but if he comes across someone who knows how to play it dangerous and still come out ok, then he's toast.  I don't buy it for a minute and found the resolution lame. The ending is so light-hearted and crappy in a \\"girls just having a good time\\" kinda way.  This isn't a chick flick and it has no place being here. There's only a few tense moments in this film, when Kurt Russell approaches the girl to give him a lapdance, and when he kills one of the women in his car. Other than that, everything else feels incredibly safe, even the dangerous car stunt that Zoe Bell pulls off.    It doesn't even have some of the campy charm that's found in Planet Terror, also not a classic, but still some fun. There's one thing I can say for this DVD (that I haven't seen) it might possibly be more interesting than the theatrical version, but I can't imagine it being so with all that pointless girltalk dominating the middle and later portions of the film it would just make it more interminable.    Here's hoping that Tarantino comes back with a film that can not only be decent, but stand on it's own. I believe he can because this film felt rushed and second rate, hopefully he creative energy hasn't been sapped.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|Not groundbreaking, but it is solid throughout and not just a single with a bunch of extra filler.
B000WMEAKC|4.0|If you haven't heard the Timbaland infused `Apologize' yet then obviously you don't listen to the radio (or watch TV since the new `Atonement' plugs have got the infectious chorus running through each steamy scene) and if that is the case then you're missing out on what the buzz is all about.  Yes, `Apologize' may very well be the best pop song released this past year, maybe even years before it.  It's strong and appealing to all genres.  It has a strong rock soul with a great hip-hop flare and a beautiful message reminiscent of something you hear out of the mouth of Sarah McLachlan.  Ryan Tedder and company are much more than a one hit wonder though.  With their debut studio album `Dreaming Out Loud' they prove that they are here to make a name for themselves.<br /><br />I had found myself a copy of their self produced album `Drowning in the Sea of Life' shortly after hearing `Apologize' for the first time and I must say that I was very happy to see the majority of that album appear here as well just remastered and polished up.<br /><br />The first of these remastered tracks is `Mercy', a classic pop-rock track that is truly infectious and the definition of catchy.  It's probably one of the best tracks to point to in order to single out the type of band OneRepublic really is at the core.  There are two versions of the radio hit `Apologize' on the bill here, the original version that no one heard (of course it's not as rough as the `original' original) and the Timbaland remix.  The two aren't all that different but in all honesty Timbaland's beats really elevate it beyond average rock track into infamy.  This song will be remembered for years to come, even if the band isn't.<br /><br />The second single of the album is `Stop & Stare', a catchy rock ballad that delivers despite not being as strong as some others here.  It's a nice song, but nothing spectacular.  I much prefer `Tyrant' although I liked the original raw version I heard off of `Drowning in the Sea of Life'.  They polished it up a little too much for my taste, but it still delivers so I can't complain too much.  `Tyrant' is one of their darker songs and it shows not only in lyrical weight but also in musicianship.  `Goodbye, Apathy' is one of their deeper songs.  Tedder has a way of pouring his heart out that makes you find yourself within his words; this way they cut much deeper.<br /><br />I remember when I heard the rough version of `All We Are' and I thought it was brilliant.  It's not a magnificent song musically but when you put it in its place you see that it is really a perfect pop-rock track and this polished remastered version is even better; way better.  The piano laden verses create a stronger mood and make this one of the highlights of the album.  I never was a fan of `Someone to Save You' and I'm still not.  It just doesn't fit with the rest of the album to me.  My favorite track of off `Drowning in the Sea of Life' is still by far my favorite track on `Dreaming Out Loud'; `Prodigal'.  The song is just so moving and emotional for me.  As Ryan's words leave his mouth and grace my ear I'm brought to this place that I can only dream music would take me.  It's magical.<br /><br />There are four tracks that are brand new, the opening U2 inspired `Say (All I Need)', the catchy `All Fall Down', the acoustic heavy `Won't Stop' and the somber `Come Home'.  Of the four the opening and closing tracks are by far the greater.  `Say' gets the album off to a great start and was a delight to hear.  You can tell there was a heavy U2 influence but OneRepublic always manages to make each track their own.  `Come Home' is far less catchy but far more moving.  Like `Prodigal' and `Apologize' this is one of those tracks that takes me somewhere beautiful.  `All Fall Down' is decent but nothing special and `Won't Stop' feels a bit too long, and that chorus gets under my skin just a tad.<br /><br />In the end this album is definitely worth the money.  OneRepublic have alreadymade a big name for themselves with just one word (that word would be `apologize' for any who weren't paying attention here) but with their debut studio effort they prove that they are determined to stick around for quite a while.  I, for one, hope they do.d (that word would be `apologize' for any who weren't paying attention here) but with their debut studio effort they prove that they are determined to stick around for quite a while.  I, for one, hope they do.

1582701709|2.0|The book does offers some simple ideas for goal setting and positive thinking, but it comes across as a cosmic hustle and con.    That said, I found this book promotes selfishness and a perpetual state of unsatisfiable and unattainable 'want'. Living like you already have the money or 'should have' only leads to one thing...massive debt. People forget that the universe does not OWE them ANYTHING.    At no point in this book is there a discussion on self-reflection of achievements and the possibility of giving back to the universe that satiated your whims.    The books also promote alienating people / family around you that are suffering or sick due to the chance of 'attracting' those energies thus undermining your goals.     The book is also to breadth in its coverage and a lot of details of energy work, meditation and self-reflection that are important are not even discussed. There is also no discussion on self-sacrifice and what it takes to truely succeed in life; WORK and COMPROMISE and COMPASSION.
0307277887|5.0|Many people claim that when a movie or TV show is based on a book, the book is always better. However, in the case of Darkly Dreaming Dexter, I believe they are equals.<br /><br />I was only recently introduced to the character, but I watched both seasons in about 2 weeks. I decided to pick up the books after that.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too many details, but the show did differ from the book on several key points. I view this as a good thing because no matter which you encounter first, it keeps both experiences fresh.<br /><br />If I had one complaint about the book, it'd be the length. It weighs in around 300 pages or so, but it could've hit 500 and still would have felt right. Thankfully, Jeff Lindsay wrote two other books to continue developing Devious Dexter's darkness.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I love this story and also bought the Firefly Series.  It's a great tale...kind of like cowboys in outer space.  Humorous, dramatic, suspenseful, and entertaining.  I highly recommend this movie and the companion tv series.

B00000K31Q|5.0|This is a light hearted teen flick, based loosely on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew.  It has extra poignancy for us now since Heath Ledger's untimely death.     As such films go, this one is surprisingly smart and held my attention from the beginning to the end (and I'm no teenager).  The whole cast is good but at this point in time, one looks especially at Heath who was barely out of his teens when he made this.  He had such sweetness and charm that it's hard not to feel deep sadness at his passing.  In time we'll forget the sadness, hopefully, and be glad that we have this film to enjoy his presence.

B000058BGZ|5.0|I'm not familiar with Brendel's Schoenberg \\"Piano Concerto\\", but Boulez has a special vision for Schoenberg. Listen to his \\"Moses and Aaron\\", sharp, cleanly impassioned, razor-sharp edges, provincial the way Bach is played, purely functional, unadorned phrases, and musical shapes. Uchida as well brings a controlled passion to the work, not compromising the work's content in any way. In fact that is a dangerous trap of over-determining Schoenberg, especially the music he wrote in exile, as this Concerto. The darkest clouds of Europa and the globe all around art and the humanity in many ways is inside this work. Schoenberg had renewed his interest in Judaism, where some actually criticized him for  doing so,coming back to the fold too late, after living a life of assimilation. Most German Jews considered themselves German first, Jews second until of they were montrously betrayed. All this history is not insignificant and has direct bearing on the work, this Concerto,to experience it from this perspective, of a man in confusion, where he has literally not much to say anymore,certainly dodecaphonic innovation is over, he could not even complete his \\"Moses and Aaron\\", did not find a solution to it.Now relying on tried and tested musical genres, known shapes to hide within, to escape to this comfort zone of tradition. The criticism against Schoenberg, by Judaic scholars is all predictably in retrospect, having the luxury of gazing comfortably backwards, retrogressively. Put yourselves in his place and then see how to respond, or not respond. He was firstly an artist, with a composer's temperment hardly the strength for politics, that he also had little capacity for and came too late. There are retrogressive elements in this Concerto, the abandonment and fulfillment of hope for humanity. Uchida and Boulez certainly comprehend this, with there functionally straight empowered reading.Boulez knows just how to balance chords while rendering rhythmic force impeccably, always moving forward aggresively to mount a trajectory for snarling trombones, and screeching wistful strings, industrial-like wind chords, with the soloist,quite independent,pummeling the piano's resonance; pondering questions, going- gesturing forward in thought.<br /><br />Uchida's solo Schoenberg I found more problematical.I have lived with Glenn Gould first then Pollini as a lifeworld. She does not have the emotive reserve of Pollini, (and I haven't heard Richter who had played the Webern \\"Variations\\" in Vienna.) Uchida goes after the music much of the time and makes it strong where it needed be. You can hide these excursions within the Schoenberg where if you have Brahms within your conception of timbre and shape of phrase in your field of vision, it may work,The late Sir Georg Solti also played Schoenberg within a Brahms-perspective. This works, but it is too predictable an approach and creates listening pleasure but little excitement.And the expressionist orchestration gets pummeled and made one-dimensional. I prefer leaner,more Bach-like dimensions of timbre in Schoenberg, where the exposed contrapuntal shapes of his music become empowered by the modern orchestration.Boulez certainly does this consistently.<br /><br />The fact that Schoenberg did not understand the resonance of the piano, attests to his genius, for this Opus 11 resonance is incredibly powerful dark, and penumbral, raw at times, unfinished at times, and ponderous. Provincial block-chordal accompaniment is what I mean here, nothing adorned, although Schoenberg had his own means of adornment, with broken chords in thirds, and fourth-chords. She does much better with the \\"Six Short Pieces\\",allowing the short shards,particles and fragments of timbre,to speak for themselves, something the next generation certainly listened to these more than any other Schoenberg. Miniatures you cannot deal with roughly, you need to simply state the materials and the discourse has ended.<br /><br />The Webern \\"Variations\\"has more problems for me perhaps not for Uchida,who again makes heavy,makes strident, makes noises where there needed be, as in the fist movement. It is also too slow, for the reoccuring mirror two-sixteenths shapes,minor ninths and major sevenths become forgotten if slowed at the tempo she plays them. You need to comprehend the emotive arc, the durational agenda of the entire work as it is perhaps one single movement. The Third movement also made less sense to me, the structures were not a-matter-of-factly played. Webern should have some refined mystery to it,yet not indulgent with some sense of a private world, introspective looking, for an inner life. This was all that was left in Nazi Germany. Ffreedom existed,only within oneself in private realms of thought and discourse, the way the current Leipzig Painters render a private(romanticized) lifeworld today unexplainable,opaque yet filled with icons and places for contemplation with history past, and where it has past them by without explanation.<br /><br />The Berg Sonata had even more problems,again this Sonata works by understatement, withoutrelative authority,or overwhelming conviction, the quasi-tonal meanderings have more interest when not fitted within the Bach-like frames we previously experienced.Berg then has some mystery to it. He was the most lyrical and backward looking philososphically of these Vienna composers. Trying to make this modest piano solo sound rotund,larger than it already is not and taking on larger dimensions does not work in Berg. His entire life he favored, had an affinity for the chamber realm, even in his two innovative operas, the orchestra is treated at its most effective, when reduced down to chamber projections of accompaniment again  with strict variations and sonata forms chamber-ized, fragmenting timbres down to short shapes and sizes for contemplation. Granted, the \\"Piano Sonata\\" Opus one is an early work without structural sophistication,nor the intervallic meanderings of his later music,but the Berg aesthetic is there.<br /><br />I should think more about Uchida's Second Viennese readings, she is a powerful lady, with an intellect of depth and persuasion, with a comprehensive performative constitution. It needs another thought after some time perhaps.me perhaps not for Uchida,who again makes heavy,makes strident, makes noises where there needed be, as in the fist movement. It is also too slow, for the reoccuring mirror two-sixteenths shapes,minor ninths and major sevenths become forgotten if slowed at the tempo she plays them. You need to comprehend the emotive arc, the durational agenda of the entire work as it is perhaps one single movement. The Third movement also made less sense to me, the structures were not a-matter-of-factly played. Webern should have some refined mystery to it,yet not indulgent with some sense of a private world, introspective looking, for an inner life. This was all that was left in Nazi Germany. Ffreedom existed,only within oneself in private realms of thought and discourse, the way the current Leipzig Painters render a private(romanticized) lifeworld today unexplainable,opaque yet filled with icons and places for contemplation with history past, and where it has past them by without explanation.    The Berg Sonata had even more problems,again this Sonata works by understatement, withoutrelative authority,or overwhelming conviction, the quasi-tonal meanderings have more interest when not fitted within the Bach-like frames we previously experienced.Berg then has some mystery to it. He was the most lyrical and backward looking philososphically of these Vienna composers. Trying to make this modest piano solo sound rotund,larger than it already is not and taking on larger dimensions does not work in Berg. His entire life he favored, had an affinity for the chamber realm, even in his two innovative operas, the orchestra is treated at its most effective, when reduced down to chamber projections of accompaniment again  with strict variations and sonata forms chamber-ized, fragmenting timbres down to short shapes and sizes for contemplation. Granted, the \\"Piano Sonata\\" Opus one is an early work without structural sophistication,nor the intervallic meanderings of his later music,but the Berg aesthetic is there.     I should think more about Uchida's Second Viennese readings, she is a powerful lady, with an intellect of depth and persuasion, with a comprehensive performative constitution. It needs another thought after some time perhaps.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I am so glad that they made this DVD box set available. Even though I'm older now, I still can remember feeling the way Angela felt in high school. This series is one of the greatest ones about teen angst. Go My So-Called Life!    Other series they ought to bring to a DVD box set:    Daria  Swan's Crossing
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Yes they focused more on the stylish dress and what not but this film was easily one of my favorites.  It's easy to follow and you tend to watch with great suspense as to what is going to happen with each character!
0061547832|5.0|Trumps attitude is very street wise - common sensical which is lost in today's world. A very good read. I like Trump so I am biased.
6305907145|5.0|This was a beautiful film!   I loved the characters and felt connected.    This is a must have for any period film lover!
B000Q6GUW0|3.0|I heard so much hype about this series that I could not wait to receive it in the mail and begin watching \\"DEXTER.\\" There is far too much foul language in the series for me. You don't need to use the \\"F\\" word every other word to be effective. It's a little out there, but it will be airing on CBS on February 17th, 2008 and there will not be anymore cussing. Yeah, yeah, yeah!!!!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|One of the movies I like to watch over and over and over again, Love Actually delivers the perfect balance of Hollywood sap and reality. This movie features multiple stories, mostly overlapping each other somehow.     This isn't one of those movies with a typical storyline of boy meets girl, falls in love, etc etc. It contains different kinds of love: love between friends, love between parent and child, love between brother and sister, etc.     The all-star cast is phenomenal. And the music is just fanastic. (Note: the use of \\"Both Sides Now\\" by Joni Mitchell in one specific scene is sure to bring tears to your eyes.)     Of course, this movie contains the infamous \\"To me, you're perfect.\\" scene, a moment which every girl dreams of... just not from someone they don't actually love.    I don't know anyone who has seen it and not loved it to bits.   It may be just another romantic comedy, but this film speaks to the heart and allows viewers to really appreciate all the people they have in their lives.    In the end, you will truly realize that love, actually, is all around.
0800141660|5.0|I love this film! I love everything about it!  I can watch this over and over and still LOVE IT!
B000MQC9H4|2.0|I'm all for romantic comedies, especially those that take place around the holidays. I had high expectations from the trailers & the cast and went into the theater fueled with excitement.     Cameron Diaz single-handedly ruined this movie. She tries way too hard. She was ACTING.     Kate Winslet was great, Jack Black always a delight. Their blossoming friendship-turned-romance was just adorable to watch.    The plot is a tad predictable, but that's pretty much how it goes for romantic comedies.    Skip it if you can. Watch if you must.    You'd have a much better time watching \\"Love Actually\\" -- best romantic comedy EVER.
B00005MP58|5.0|Honestly, I wouldn't have thought any film would to the book justice but this one does!   Very easy to follow and MUCH better than the more recent adaptation. This will forever be a classic!
184195425X|5.0|I didn't expect this book to be what it is. I don't know what I expected and I probably would have never picked up this book if I hadn't had to read it for a book club. I didn't even know what it was about. I have just heard about it on the newswire, through other people saying they're reading \\"Life of Pi\\" right now. That was pretty much it.     I was in for a ride and didn't even know it. This is definitely one of the most unique subject matter I could think of. I am one of those people who are convinced that zoos are a necessary evils because my children and grandchildren may never see wild animals at large. This novel has somewhat convinced me to change my mind on that matter. Like a lot of reviwers here, the first few chapters were my favorite. It set the tone for an easy, laid back novel, where things move slowly like molasses on a hot summer day. Then wham! The ship starts sinking and Pi was forced to swim to the lifeboat to save his life.    For a long time, I thought Richard Parker was a human being and I couldn't fathom why anyone would try to fend off another human being striving for the boat with an oar. I didn't realize that Richard Parker was a bengal tiger. Then there was a zebra, a hyena and an orangetan. All those wild animals in a life boat with one scrawny human being. Wow!     This book is definitely should be perfect for book club discussions because there are so many layers of concepts and hidden meanings. As soon as you start thinking of one aspect, another thought pops to your mind. And this review cannot convey my thoughts so well. Even though I finished this book yesterday, I am still finding myself reaching for it. It is an compelling story of horror and amazement and a strong will to survive. It doesn't leave the mind so easily. I cannot fathom the months-long torture of surviving at sea, let along with a tiger on board. And the flesh-eating forest ... whew! Yuck.    If you are looking for a book that will make you think and even have youresearching to see if it is a true story (it is written compellingly enough to convince me that it was a real story. I was rather disappointed when I found out that it was a novel!), then this novel is for you. It is grotesque in spots but it is so fascinating to read about one man's survival.    2/8/08

B000K15VSA|5.0|Blade Runner has alway been one of my favorite movies.  The new final cut makes the movie perfect.  The other DVD that come with it are inspiring.
B000WGYMAQ|4.0|The music ranges from true rock 'n roll songs to excellent Broadway musical numbers. So if you're not enjoying what they're singing at any given moment, just wait a bit and the tempo/mood will change soon enough. Best scenes: 'Light My Candle' and 'Tango Maureen'. The cast is perfect - most are from the Broadway production. New to the cast is Rosario Dawson, who may just be the most enticing East Village denizen you'll ever encounter. A bit slow at times, but a nice visual balance between gentrified NYC and the real nitty gritty of the bohemian scene.
0920668364|5.0|\\"Love You Forever\\" is a beautifully written story that sends a clear message to ADULTS and to children.  It is a beautifully illustrated, tender story of caring for children as a parent...and then, in our later years, our children care for us as their child. My husband bought me this book, and I love it. I go to this book (with tissues in hand) to remember my own days as a parent, and I see myself through this story as I move from one age bracket to the next.  Every baby announcement I receive, I give the gift of \\"classic\\" first books to start the newborns library.  This is one book I ALWAYS include.  Our grown children who love their own children but remember to honor their parents along their lifetime will cherish this wonderful story.
0743486285|5.0|I could not put this book down!  As you are reading you can't help but wonder how he lived to tell the tale.  The things he goes through are heartbreaking.  It makes you realize he is not the only one that has been or is at the bottom and most don't make it back out.  He did.  This book is gripping and compelling especially if you know someone who is battling any sort of addiction. You enter Nikkis world and find it is filled with nightmares that are real. Absolutely a must read!!
0793518326|5.0|I bought this years ago when it first came out for over $100. Now that I'm rebuilding my third lost empire, I knew the moment I surfed it up that I needed to replace this essential scoring of all the Beatles' music. It reveals the actual parts as played on the records. A great tool to evaluate Beatles \\"textures\\" and harmonic tricks to use as \\"musical quotations\\" or more subtle references in my original works... especially the vocal harmonies and the melody lines! At this price it's a re-outlay I had no qualms over.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I love this CD.  The music goes so well with the book.  It really gives you some insite on what Nikki was going through battling his addiction.  I would not have believed that music and a book on Heroin could be this compelling. This is a CD everyone needs to own!  Absolutley amazing!!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched the movie first and honestly didn't know anything about Firefly other than I would occasionally here about Janes Hat or someone being a Brown Coat. Not that I had a clue what it was all about.    After the movie I decided I had to see what the series was about and I have to say that it is really saying something when I sit in front of the TV, as I'm notoriously picky and more to the point, busy - I might manage about 4 hours of television a month if I'm lucky. That said, I sat down over the course of a week and watched all of these, and feel that this is possibly one of the best series that was ever on television and I can't possibly understand why they would cancel it.    Serious oversight on someones part and hopefully they lost their job over that decision!    It's a good series, my wife and kids liked it, safe for the family, plenty of humor and action and it was killed way before its time.     Buy it, get it, love it.
B000I2IT44|5.0|I have this DVD two days and have already listened to it 5 times.Hatesong is my favourite.The sound is really good.The Blackfield DVD is a good one to look out for aswell.
B000P12LWY|5.0|The Tudors DVDs are beyond words.....we went through them a little quick as I couldn't wait to find out what schtick King Henry would pull in the next episode! I'm glad we have them on DVD so we can re-watch! Can't wait for next season...
B000WZAE0Y|4.0|If you like Witches,Ali Barber and Brigadoon then Stardust is the movie for you. Stardust is a movie that encompasses all the elements of fantasy   with Robert De Niro demonstrating what a magnificent actor he is. Star dust is a movie that touchs on childhood themes of Pirates, Magic and a few laughs to help the the movie along.  Stardust is a magnificent story that enhance the imagination.
1594489505|4.0|I've bought it for Xmas gift. It has been very appreciated. Of course I already knew the book was the desired title but it liked even because of the elegant and fine special cover.

B000XJ5TOK|2.0|RE is a real deception. It could be a great edition if the poor definition was not so crearly. Good colour, but few extras. If you have the DVD-Video Superbit edition, avoid this BD.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|War is something that has been around since the existence of man, we as a species are naturally violent and although some people will disagree. To an extent war and violence is beautiful, depending on how it is portrayed and 300 is one of them films that portrays war in its greatest beauty. The beauty of the war told in this film is the beauty that only 300 men defended their land against the invasion of The Persian King Xerxes and his army of men almost 20 times as big. The defending of a kings family and home against an army who he is unconcerned of its size is simply beautiful as it tells of the human nature of self sacrifice to save those we love.<br /><br />To those familiar with the original 1962 film \\"The 300 Spartans\\" this can simply be described as a jazzed up remake of the original, which can cater for todays audience. This is certainly CGI friendly with pretty much 80% of the whole film setting being in CGI. Also some of the major events in the film slow down and is shown in complete slow motion which I feel added to the drama and impact of the battle scenes and a particular individual event.<br /><br />Being jazzed up, I think I made a bit of an understatement as some of the major villains in this film are so overdone it becomes quite ridiculous. Whether that be Xerxes being close to 10 feet tall or whether that be the oricles looking too un-human to be passed off as real. This in a way I think is too much as it pulls away from some of the true hystorical elements that inspired this story. Some people would think that the fancy gore effects or the strange looking villains would be a cool thing, but being a true fan of cinema this was one of the only things I hated about this film.<br /><br />The acting is dramatic, the action is intense and Gerard Butler makes a spectacular King and is a great leading man. He seems to express a passion and charisma that you don't regularly notice in a role like this. The fight scenes are plentiful and seem to have been choreographed to an extent which makes it truly inspiring and there doesn't seem to be a single point where you can say \\"looks like they missed a step there\\"<br /><br />On a lighter note the film is very camp with the whole army being very rugged with washboard abs and seeming to wear what can only be described as tight fitted underpants. This has also received a bit of criticism for containing racist undertones with the whole enemy army being black or dark skinned. This is something to be left up to the viewer as I didn't really see the big deal or the justification in that criticism, although I do suspect some people will understand the criticism.<br /><br />I would suggest that you rent this before you buy it, it's what I like to call a Marmite movie.<br /><br />You either love it or you hate it.t which makes it truly inspiring and there doesn't seem to be a single point where you can say \\"looks like they missed a step there\\"    On a lighter note the film is very camp with the whole army being very rugged with washboard abs and seeming to wear what can only be described as tight fitted underpants.

B000VLE3V0|5.0|The package is very beautiful , all vinyls are very nice. The vinyl bonus has special songs.  The poster and cards are cool.  Thank you very much.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I previously owned this series on tape which I literally wore out! Cleese at his brilliantly funny best, and a must have for the collection of any Brit comedy devotee.
B000X9Q8A4|5.0|What a great soundtrack!  The actors did such a wonderful job with each song making it like the song of old but putting a new twist on it!  All I can say is amazing and worth every penny!  The movie was really exceptional as well!
6305291446|5.0|\\"Michael Myers\\" returning after a 20 year absence, was every bit worth the wait! Jamie Lee Curtis, has taken the role of Laurie Strode and made it her own, and adding in the storyline, of Josh Hartnett Playing her son, was priceless. It grabs at your heart how she is always trying to warn everyone and no one believes her. Also bringing her real life mother Janet Leigh in, was an extra bonus no one expected, but loved!!! great addition to my collection!
0525950079|5.0|This is the first book by this author that I have read. I'm only part way through the book and my initial impression is that the author is an excellent storyteller who fleshes out his characters well and keeps the story moving along
B000EXZI14|5.0|I can always count on Amazon to have the product I need and for the fast service I receive.  Thank you!
0446401307|4.0|The plot is dandy but the end of it are just words. I'm really disappointed as how they found the bad guy and just everything ended as a fairy tale. This doesn't mean that the book is bad or wrong-written but the end of it doesn't par the beginning. If you are planing a long flight you could read this one in a sitting.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|We (my wife and me) saw this movie in the theater and really liked it - just a really entertaining, funny and enjoyable fairytale. This transfer is vibrantly colorful with wonderful detail and audio. Great movie to own. I played it through a Toshiba X-A2, Onkyo 705 to a JVC 61FH97
B0011NVC9I|4.0|Isn't it offered in 3D?  It was shown in the theater in 3D?  We just spent lots of money for the latest shutter glasses, new living room PC,  for our DLP and all the 3D movies are released in 2D?  Why don't they offer it in 3D?
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This Series is amazing as you probably know if you're reading this review.  I had forgotten may of the episodes from early on and it was nice to have them all in order to watch.  The packaging is also pretty cool and fun.  I definitely thought it was worth it.  I've never owned an of the seasons separately, so I can't comment on if this is better, but I really love it.  The script from the pilot it comes with is interesting and the guide book is useful and has a lot of nice pictures from the series.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|I'm not much for live albums, but this is really worth picking up if you want to hear what they sounded like before they went MTV/commercial. Since finding the early pre-lovedrive stuff is relativly difficult and expensive to find in the states,this is a great CD to get for some 70s stings. You get select songs from all of the records they did up till that point in time. Recorded in Tokyo Sunplaza Hall in 78', \\"Tokyo Tapes\\" has a very well recorded and intimate sound qaulity to it. Everything is preformed with passion, and alot of these track ARE superior to the studio counterparts. Check out the amazing version of \\"WE'LL BURN THE SKY\\" with the extended soloing, \\"TOP OF THE BILL\\" where Herman does a drum solo for the fans, and Roth on \\"FLY TO THE RAINBOW\\". Klause's singing and audience banter in Japanese with thick german accent (KOJO NO TSUKI) is quite entertaining. \\"POLAR NIGHTS\\", on the original wax version, is missing though, but you get a nice rarity called \\"ALL NIGHT LONG\\"...coooooool. Great find and buy.<br /><br />Veeeeel Burn Zee Sky!
0743277457|4.0|Waitzkin has so much to offer the rest of us in his rare ability, coupled with genuine desire and earthy enthusiasm, to disassemble the learning process -- as applied to both chess and Tai Chi at their highest levels --and then disseminate it. So much so that I believe this book is, unfortunately, about 10 years premature. I think he's not yet done unraveling How We Learn, and will have more revelations before he's through which will beg similar synthesization and impartment.     Essentially, I think the book, as good at times as it was, missed the mark because 1) it was premature -- he is still growing as a writer and philosophical thinker (although already much better than the vast majority of us)  2) it was not well edited. It was too many things, mixed too much together.     I think a 'revised & expanded' version of this book in a decade or so could be truly seminal. The raw material is already there, but too buried. He also needs some background in Education so he can bring that into his discussion. E.g. some of the things he talks about, such as integrating technical information until it becomes natural intelligence, there are already terms for such as 'scaffolding,' 'automaticity.' He is not inventing the wheel, but adding richness and layers, through his singular expertises, to what is already known.
B0007TKNKG|5.0|Great movie, up there with Cobra and Lock-up and Tango & Cash.  It's Stallone outside Rambo and Rocky, and just a lot of fun, considering the age of the movie.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|LOVE this movie.  could watch it over and over.  Wonderful music so we play the CD all the time too.  I'm hoping they win the Academy Award for their song!
B000YPUF9W|5.0|It's a great shoot-'em-up zombie flick that appeals to people outside of the gaming community as well.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|The third part of the \\"Lord of the Rings Recordings\\" is mandatory for everyone who enjoys the music of the movie. The quality of this product is very good.
B000VNMMRA|5.0|it was in perfect conditions like the discription.  a fantastic movie.  bruce willis at its best!!!!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|this cd is one of the best i have ever heard! every song is sung with such great emotion and feeling that its impossible not to get into it and sway to the music. glen hansard has an amazing voice that, while not \\"technically perfect\\" strongly emotes every word he sings. this cd is not just a collection of great music, its an emotional, musical ride from start to finish that leaves you wanting to listen to it over and over again. i especially like the first song \\"falling slowly\\" and the second \\"if you want me\\" and the fourth \\"when your minds made up\\" and the very last song \\"say it to me now\\". these songs are perfect examples of the high levels of emotion caught by glen hansard and marketa irglova's exceptional voices.

B00005JPLW|4.0|I think you have to accept certain movies for what they are.  I wasn't expecting Shakespeare so I wasn't disappointed.  I wanted visual excitement, it's what I got.  Overall, I liked the movie and I thought the cinematography and stylistic visuals were great.

B000VDDWE2|4.0|I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes the sci-fi, \\"end of the world\\" type of movies. I really enjoyed it. Looks amazing on Blu-ray High Def as well.

0060794410|5.0|It just so happened I began to listen (I bought the audio version) as problems with an employee began to get out of control. Because we are a non-profit 501 (c) (3) ministry, I did not want to let this employee go, and for the longest time continued to work with her. However, her performance deteriorated, and I was feeling sick over the whole thing. This book helped me to understand that I wasn't doing the employee, myself or the rest of the staff and volunteers any favors by keeping her on. To the relief of everyone, based on what I heard I made the decision to let her go. The employee who wasn't performing anyway was not happy in her job, but wanted to continue to do only what  she chose. She is still unhappy and making some trouble. But nothing like it was when she was working for me. Everyone else (as Jim says in the book) came to me and asked, \\"What took you so long?\\"
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I VISITED AMERICA LAST YEAR TO SEE CELINE DION. AFTER WATCHING THE DVD, I LIVED THAT NIGHT AGAIN, THE DVD IS FANTASTIC. I AM NOT A FAN OF LIVE PERFORMANCE'S BUT THIS DVD IS AWESOME.

0312323867|3.0|I found both \\"Something Borrowed\\" and \\"Something Blue\\" to be engaging stories- and better written than most 'chick lit' novels out there.  However, I did have some issues with them. While the narcissistic Darcy is admittedly hard to sympathize with, I found it even harder to like Rachel, who struck me as pathologically passive.  How are we supposed to believe this woman, who has let her best friend steamroll over her their whole lives is a high powered lawyer?  She seems way too meek for such an aggressive profession.  And that impression was not improved in the rest of \\"Something Borrowed\\".  Throughout her relationship with Dex, she never confronts him about his duplicity, never asks him what he is going to do, whether he is going to break up with Darcy.  He is only forced into discussing it with her, when her friend Hillary confronts him, and this seems to not anger her in the least.  As for Dex, I could not understand what all the fuss was about- he seemed very dull, stiff, pretentious and worst of all, given the part he played in everything, righteous.  Ethan, however, I felt was infinitely the better catch.  Emily Giffin even describes him (through Darcy's eyes) as adorable, witty, smart and good.  Who would not fall in love with someone like that?  Darcy's life in New York may have been frivolous, but in the end, she ends up with the bigger prize anyway (Ethan)- thereby one-upping Rachel yet again.  So if the moral of the story is that being vain and shallow will only lead to ruin and disappointment- these novels don't quite get there. Darcy is flawed and self-involved through much of the two novels, but at least she is interesting and dynamic, which was more than I could say for Rachel.
1569242739|5.0|I have so far made the 'Rosewater pistachio', 'Chai latte' and 'Green tea' cupcakes and shared them with many friends; none of which were vegan except me, but nodody even knew the difference. In fact, I would go so far as to say that animal products are simply unnecessary to make a fabulous cupcake! This book has 75 + recipes, all of which are very tantalizing and pretty simple to make. Who doesn't smile when they are given a cute little cupcake? Vanilla and chocolate are so boring compared to all the delectable flavors they have. I'm going to bake the 'Lychee with coconut glaze' cupcakes this weekend, can't wait! Get this book, even if you're not vegan.
0060775858|5.0|I purchased this book for my twins because we needed a good bedtime story.  It is a great story to read at bedtime.  It has become apart of our nightly ritual.  For those needing a little help developing their bedtime routines, I would highly recommend this book!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I love this movie.  It is one of the greatest!  I watch it over and over again.  The humor of it all is like no other.  This movie comes highly recommend if you like movies like 'Dude, where's my car', 'Friday' and the like.
0143058525|5.0|Loved it! I was very sad when it was over. Also you should know that the author reads this book herself, and has a very lovely voice.

B000MRAAJW|4.0|I received Planet Earth as a gift. What an amazing series! My original gift was the low-def version and I could tell it was a bit grainy. I traded it in for the HD-DVD version and what a different the hi-def makes! You must see this series and you must see it in hi-def to really get the complete experience. The camera angels, views, and nature that are captured in Planet Earth is something you will not soon forget.
B000YPUF9W|3.0|I thought this movie might be good, but I found that it was mainly just some action sequences with some zombies.  The killing gets mundane and quite uninteresting.  Some items in the plot didn't make sense, so what I did was get all the parts in the resident evil series, and then watch them all.  Now I am asking myself, why did I waste my time with this movie?  Why did I waste my time with getting the whole series?    If you're a fan of the video game, you might like this movie, otherwise, I suggest skipping on it.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This DVD features one of the best concerts we've ever watched.  The quality of audio and video is excellent.  The guest stars work very well with Gilmour.  Highly recommended for any Pink Floyd fan.

0375842209|3.0|Though a tale of middle class German life during the WWII, it does not ring true. There are some historical anomalies, i.e., few Germans were unemployed during the war and until the end, few suffered hunger on the scale described. On the whole it is an interesting, t hough not great book.

1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is at least a very moving tale. It tells the story of the agonies endured by the women of Afganistan and it relates with beauty and literary competence a situation that is deplorable. While women world over are diminished by their cultures, Afganistan seems to be near the worst. I recommend this book to all men and women.

0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has written a brilliant book on awakening.  This book doesn't consist of a lot of feel-good exercises and stories; it gets right to the heart of what makes life meaningful - which is to be fully conscious in the present moment.<br /><br />He points out that the normal state of mind is dysfunction and that most people are completely identified with the incessant stream of thoughts that run through their mind, most of which are repetitive and pointless.<br />He also notes that the voice in your head is not who you are, and that the ultimate truth of who you are is not \\"I am this\\" or \\"I am that,\\" but \\"I am.\\"<br /><br />He explains that all egos are the same - they live on identification and separation.  You counter the ego with awareness.  You can become more aware by focusing on your breathing and giving the current moment your full attention.<br /><br />If you're really open to what he has to say, you'll discover a whole new way to be in this world which is more peaceful, more loving and more open to whatever is happening in the current moment.

0307387178|4.0|Into the wild; back into your mind and spirit.    This emotional and compelling narrative story is forcefully written by Jon Krakauer.  Into the Wild, published in 1996, tells the relationship between one \\"wild\\" inspired boy against nature.  Chris McCandless went missing on a cross country trip during the summer of 1990.  Driven by a strained relationship with his parents, and turning his back on the successful path after graduating with honors from Emory University, McCandless began a two year continental odyssey through dozens of major cities and three countries.  This was not a conventional excursion--it was a new beginning for McCandless.  Beginning by donating $24,000 of his savings to a charity, McCandless began to separate from normal society.  He changed his name, his goals, and his perception of people.  He adopted a new morality and most importantly, he removed himself from the established norm.    Krakauer acts as a journalist, retracing and explaining all of these experiences by interviewing many of those who ran into Chris McCandless on his journey.  This writing style, although quite different from the norm, enabling the reader to vividly understand and feel the character from many different view points.  The effect is captivating, because McCandless' character is one of a loner driven by his desire to experience life in a completely unconventional way.  There are no illustrations in this true story, but none are needed.  Jon Krakauer is able to convey a meaningful journey that society would regard as idiotic.  One finally recognizes that McCandless (in Krakauer's words) was not a \\"wacko\\" or \\"a narcissist\\", but it is still up to each reader to form ones' own opinion of Chris McCandless.  The fascinating interviews Krakauer obtains from people that McCandless met along the way, offers deep insights into this young man's nature.  Krakauer relies on McCandless' own writing, whether it is in his diary or his letters, to explain his character to the reader.A letter Chris McCandless wrote to a man, Ron Franz, he met in Salton City, California is used to show what McCandless thought is the basic meaning of life.  Trying to motivate this man to change his life, McCandless writes,     \\"...The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure.  The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.  If you want to get more out of life, Ron, you must lose you inclination for monotonous security and adapt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy.  But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty.  And so, Ron, in short, get out of Salton City and hit the Road.  I guarantee you will be very glad you did.  But I fear that you will ignore my advice...you are wrong if you think Joy emanates only or principally from human relationships.  God has placed it all around us.  It is in everything and anything we might experience.  We just have to have the courage to turn against our habitual lifestyle and engage in unconventional living.  My point is that you do not need me or anyone else around to bring this new kind of light in your life.  It is simply waiting out for you there for you to grasp it, and all you have to do is reach.  The only person you are fighting is yourself.\\"  I will not reveal what ultimately befalls Chris McCandless on his journey to a new person.  I will tell that the insights and motivations that are revealed in this compelling and eloquent book will make you challenge your pre-conceived notions about life.  Be prepared to challenge your own assumptions about life.
B0012BTBQU|5.0|My husband introduced me to this book and I went into it thinking \\"Well, I will put up with it for him\\" and I fell in love!!!  This is one of my all time favorite novels, and I loved the second one as well!  \\"Elantris\\"- Brandon's other book is completely wonderful as well!  I am normally a romance novel reader, but this book has it all, action, romance, and a whole new fantastical world!  I recommend this book to EVERYONE- try it and you will love it, I promise!
6304696558|5.0|I love Goldie Hawn movies and purchased Private Benjamin to watch (again) with my granddaughter who just enlisted in the military...we watched it prior to her leaving for boot camp, and I'm sure it helped her prepare for her \\"adventure\\".
B00004RFFI|5.0|This is a wonderful movie .I enjoyed it very much.The actors do a wonderful job.Very real looking.I would recomend this movie to anyone.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is a great movie. I never heard of it hitting the big screen, but caught it on PPV or HBO. I had to buy it. The \\"Old timey\\" Music is surprisingly catchy.  A great addition to any DVD collection.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Saw these DVD's and realized what an awesome deal they were so I grabbed them. If you want to see a REALLY good portrayal of war - one that is actually a true story instead of some directors idea of war - grab these! There is of course violence and some language; it is a war series after all. The only real problem I had with them was one brief, needless, sex scene in one of the later episodes. Over all these are some of the best war \\"movies\\" you could ever watch.
B000YENUI6|2.0|This movie was okay. Viggo Mortensen was fantastic as usual, but mis-/under-utilized. Without his performance, this would essentially have been a \\"Jason Statham\\" action movie. There were a number of cringe-worthy dialogue moments, as well as general heavy-handedness; the music in scenes telling you \\"this is an important scene,\\" for example. This was a decidedly NOT deep movie, which was too bad since it seemed to think it was. History of Violence was a much much better movie, though it seems not so much due to Cronenberg. This one reminds me of the final showdown scene in HOV (the worst, most dumb action movie part of the movie - \\"brohim\\" indeed!) but for a whole film. I enjoy good action scenes, and there were one or two in this one, but that is about all there was to it. It was mercifully short.
630463949X|4.0|I really enjoyed the dance and had to listen hard not to hear Christine McVie's soulful melodic part in the band and enjoyed the memories, the harmony, the smiles that came to me often. People who rant about things, internal problems seem to forget all is human and the music and love of the songs, melodies, words and memories should be the reason for buying a cd or dvd anyway. Of course there are stinkers with every group one time or another but the good very far outweighs the other.  cabaniss1....anne
B00028HBKC|5.0|not a \\"get some popcorn and milk duds\\" movie. Very convicting for the Christian believer. Makes you realize what the crucifixion was. If you are a Christian, watch it. Thank God for sending his Son. Thank Christ for going through that.
B000MTPANQ|4.0|As someone with a back rod, other health issues that require me to rest lots,  I am very pleased with this dvd and the others  I have purchased.  In a strange way the music and getting lost in it helps with the pain,  On this dvd I liked the scenes, but wish there had been more of him personally singing.
0316010669|5.0|This was an amazing book. An in depth set of thoughts on how we allow momentary glimpses of our world to affect how we think. A masterful treatise on how snap judgemments show both our passions and our prejudices.
B00001OH7G|5.0|I got the Irish Tour DVD and I was hooked. It was great to see a Bluesman put it out there and rip through the Strat. The band is very tight in this recording. If you don't start moving your feet during \\"Walk On Hot Coals\\" then you are... well... my wife going for the volume knob that is set at 11. I guess her feet were moving too. This Album Rocks out completely. It is Live, Raw, Tight, and worth every penny. The Strat is way out front on the recording. The rhythm section is right there. The only down side is Rory's vocals are set back a bit on the sound stage. I thought the DVD release of this recording was engineered a little better on the mix. Still 5 stars. It is live man.
0060557818|4.0|This book is darker than Stardust but still as imaginative.  The involvement of the tube stations in London really makes it interesting, especially if you've been there and seen those stations and lines.     Honestly, I think if this same book had been written by a woman you'd see more romance between the two main characters and less of the very vile villians. And I really can't see a woman author putting in a lesbian warrior - she's right out of a male fantasy video game. But despite the male flavor of the story, I liked it.     He uses the 'f' word several times, mostly as a verb, not as a pejorative. There are a few mentions of sex but none detailed or graphic.      I don't think this is one I will read over and over again but I did enjoy it and would recommend it to others (mostly guys) I know.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|A very powerful set of songs based on the classic story of the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Even if you don't speak or understand French, nothing is missed as the emotions tell the true tale.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|After listening to this album, I'd have to say that Blondie are one of a handful of the best US bands of all time...maybe top 3...if not better. This re-evaluation of the band is due to listening to a lot of songs which you don't hear on commercial FM stations in Australia. Over here, you can expect to hear \\"Heart of glass\\" a lot. I used to find this a great song but now tend to avoid listening to it when it's on the radio. You do tend to hear \\"Call me\\" often too, which is a great, driving, rock song. Too much of that song is barely enough, as Roy and H.G. might say.      It was great to rediscover \\"The hardest part\\", a song I had totally forgotten from \\"Eat to the beat\\", an L.P. I used to own as a kid. Listening to that song now, it strikes me as the kind of song Jimmy Barnes or AC/DC would do...a very boyzone kind of track, in stark contrast to the sublime girly vocals that lead singer Debbie Harry usually does. If I hadn't just checked Amazon's listing for \\"Eat to the beat\\" I would have said that this compilation I'm reviewing is definitive, but some of the songs listed on \\"Eat to the beat\\" ring a few bells for me, so maybe a couple more songs from the that earlier album would have done the trick. In any case, this compilation is vastly superior to some skinny compilations I've seen around the place.       The sound quality on this cd is quite good...sounds really bright, and I tend to like that quality in cds. On occasion, it may sound a bit harsh but otherwise, I have no complaints.       One of the qualities I like about the band is the satisfying drumming/drum sound. I make the same comment in my review of The Police's latest compilation. The major hook of the band is the silky, liquid, cooing vocals of Debbie Harry, the blonde bombshell of the band. She can really hold a note too. A great front woman.    Listening to this cd, another comment I can make about their music is the style that they play. To me, they seem to have been influenced by 50's music, and 60's girl band music, but they give a modern update to it.    They do experiment with music though: \\"The tide is high\\" [which features a Darth Vader look alike in the video!] has a reggae feel to it, and \\"Island of lost souls\\" has a Calypso sound to it. The latter was a minor hit in Australia and I think it was the last time the band charted here.    There are two good songs which features Harry incorporating French lyrics to great effect: \\"Denis\\" and \\"Sunday girl\\".    My pick as the best songs on this album are \\"Call me\\" and \\"Atomic\\". The latter has a great bass line in the middle of it. One of the best songs for a great bass solo.    Blondie can also lay claim to being one of the first, if not the first band to take rap music mainstream with \\"Rapture\\". The pre-rap part of this song is divine, with Harry at her sensual, sexual, cooing best. It has a gorgeous bell melody at the start, with Harry sounding all girly, then sounding like a sexual woman later in the piece [the song \\"Maria\\" also has a very nice bell part to it]. Her rapping and the video are historically interesting for mentioning some 'names' of that scene at the time. The video features graffiti art by well known 'taggers' of the time [graffiti artists].    Some of the songs which make me think of 50's/60's acts are: Dreaming [60's], X Offender [50's/60's], In the flesh [50's/60's girl band sound], Denis [has a Buddy Holly sound, from the 50's] and Sunday Girl.    Apart from the two songs which I think are great [Call me/Atomic/Rapture], the songs I consider to be good on this album are: Dreaming/The tide is high/In the flesh/Denis/Union city blue/The hardest part/Sunday girl/ and Maria. \\"Union city blue\\" is a soaring, anthemic song...perfect to sing along too!    Australia gave Blondie their first international hit. Harry says:    \\"We met Ian [host of seminal Australian music show \\"Countdown\\"] in 1977 when we were supporting Iggy Pop in the States. He asked us if we had any videos. We gave himvideos for X-Offender and In The Flesh. On Countdown they were meant to play X-Offender, but they played In The Flesh instead. So our success in Australia was one big mistake! By the end of 1977, In The Flesh had hit number two in Australia. It was our first hit anywhere in the world\\".    Have heard Harry say elsewhere, I think, that maybe Australian stations were a bit too conservative to play \\"X Offender\\" at the time. Hearing the latter song for the first time on this cd, I find that amusing. The song isn't particularly confronting and I think \\"In the flesh\\" is actually the superior song...by a loooooooong way.    Lastly, some years ago I saw Blondie on pay tv, playing live. I thought Harry was awful...she was still acting like she was the blonde bombshell she used to be and her singing reminded you of how great she used to sing these classics. My wish was for Harry to develop another kind of stage persona and sing her songs in a different, but cool way. Say, maybe more punkish, or raunchy...like Tina Turner, perhaps. A couple of songs on this album could show the way for her, I think: \\"One way or another\\" which has a freakshow carnival sort of vocal sound to it...phlegmy etc. \\"Picture this\\", which sounds a little Country, has Harry making gargling sounds with her singing. Finding a similar edger to her voice now I think would suit the band perfectly...age has taken away her sublime voice and the ability to hold those notes.    Without this album, I'd be restricted to thinking that the only decent songs this band had are the ones you hear on commercial radio in Australia. The fact that these stations always flog songs to death should be a warning on how bad that assumption is.    The Red Hot Chilli Peppers are probably the only American band which shades Blondie. This album is a must buy for pop/rock fans.

B0000032LS|5.0|The CD captures the soul of the actual film to a tee. Everyone is there, the people are the same, the music is excellent. It is a great way to take the Time Warp with you without the TV!
159562015X|1.0|This was not helpful - the results were vague and contradictory.  And the follow up implementation plan had little \\"real world\\" value.  Plus I didn't learn anything I didn't know - I found myself thinking \\"no...duh\\" a lot.    I heard the first book was good and the writer is a very engaging speaker. (I think the second book just made a money-making gimmick out of it - typical sequel syndrome)
B000LXISE6|4.0|Josh Groban has done it again. His CD, Awake, is full of uplifting and enchanting songs- too many to review individually. He is quoted with saying that \\"Closer is a more direct representation\\" of who he really is, however, I think Awake fits the bill much better. It has a good balance of the languages, wonderful big band type music, and some great guest artists. Awake is definately worth the time!
0345479092|5.0|If you want to sleep, this is the way to go. Bought it for the wife but both reaping the benefits.
B000KQGX1Y|4.0|All in all, this was a good purchase on my part. I enjoy the music and the charm, the only down side being that the CD cut out too many of the songs from the original performance. I realize that there is only so much room on the CD, but the choices made by the \\"professionals\\" didn't do the best job. Aside from that, the CD is excellent, and I would reccomend it.
0765350386|5.0|I was brought to this book a very indirect way : when I heard that the wife of recently deceased Robert Jordan had asked the author to complete the Wheel of Time after being impressed by this book. After reading it, I completely agree with this choice. The universe is much smaller than in the WoT, and the metaphysical element is not quite so present but the book is really good and keps me wanting for more.    If you are interested in a fantazy epic with a very coherent magic system and not so much a struggle between Good and Evil as between good and evil people, I strongly recommend to buy it.    From this point on my review may contain spoilers, so don't read it if you don't want to learn elements that will make you see the plot not quite the way it's intended by the author.    A small bad point however: the very simple way the inquisitors are beaten is the end is not quite realistic. It is not believable that so simple a secret of the Inquisitors' weakness could have been kept for a thousand years. It reminds me of cartoons of my youth, where evil all-powerful robots always got beaten when somebody removed the battery that happened to be unprotected at their back. And why did nobody think to do that before?    To finish on a good note, the litterary game on the Lord Ruler's real identify is very, very well done.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|I purchased this CD, for a good price from Amazon, to replace the heavily scratched original which kept skipping.  I've since ripped this to my MP3 player.    I've got to say, the remaster has a little more dynamics, but the biggest difference is the liner notes.  Where the original only had a few lines and photos (my favorite quote is from Tom, \\"Thanks to CBS for their patience\\" a sarcastic remark for rushing him to finish the album), this album has more photos and a 'critique' if you will from a friend of Tom's.    Tom may have been rushed into making the album, but it was the '70s.  Every record label was pushing their artists to put out an album every year, sometimes more.  As a Rush fan, Neil Peart once spoke of 'finally emerging from a long, dark tunnel' after which the band put out no fewer than 11 albums in 8 years (1974-1981).  Record and tour, that was the way things were done back then.    Obviously, this album doesn't sound nowhere near as tight as the first or third albums.  But there are still 4-5 really good songs on the album; not a bad sophmore recording if you ask me.
B00005JPKE|5.0|After having been on Iwo Jima while in the Navy. I was so impressed with  how the Japaneese had built thier fortificatons. I was on a flight crew flying on a c-130 supplying the Coast Guard station there. The island looked just like the movie. The movie pretty much was right on the mark.  The Coast Guard guide took us thru the caves and down to the beach. The  movie seen thru the eyes of the Japaneese was fantastic. Clint Eastwood  did a great job directing and the photos and acting were A-1.  GREAT MOVIE It brings credit to those who served and died on the rock....  thats both Japaneese and Americans The movie supports the other film  done by Clint Eastwood... Flags of our Fathers One must see both to appreceiate each movie.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  Granted,it is a slow moving story (unlike a Die Hard flick) however, take time, sit back, relax and you will find the gold nuggets all through the film.  And remember, this is true!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life looks great in color.  I remember watching the old colorized version and being very disappointed. Back then, it was much better in black and white.  My husband, the purist, still prefers to watch it in black and white. I am happy to own this two-disc set to get the best of both versions.     I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows... It is so good, and I can't wait to watch the 2nd season.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I watched the original black and white version. It looks and sounds great.  I didn't buy the video for the special features, so I didn't pay much attention to them.      I would recommend Miracle on 34th Street to everyone, young, old, or in between.
B000002VMD|5.0|This cd was in great condition and arrived to me on time.  I am enjoying it very much. It has proven to be everything I expected it to be.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|What can I say. Best album, best band ever. A7x ROCKS!!!<br />Don't let your young children have the explicit lyrics edition.
B0002UOK04|5.0|The moment I put this album on for the first time, I knew that I had chosen wisely.  It wasn't too much of a gamble buying it, though, as I was already familiar with Jari M&auml;enp&auml;&auml;'s work with Ensiferum.<br /><br />There is a very clear theme going on here surrounding ice and snow and all the metaphors you could possibly elicit from those things (pretty much every song).  The fact that the band and album carry the same name, and that the winter concept is fully exhausted, it makes me think that this album is just a one off deal.  I truly hope that is not the case.<br /><br />Musically, this is very heavy and fast melodic death metal for the most part.  There are some nice keyboard/synth orchestrations that lend an epic feeling to the music (especially on the longer tracks).  The clean vocal parts also add some diversity.  If you are a fan of the style then this album will not disappoint.  It's definitely becoming one of my favorites.
0060899220|5.0|Anthony, a.k.a. Tony, is a great writer, at times I feel like I am there in the kitchen with him.  His sense of humor is off the charts and I truely have taken in some of his suggestions.    If you want and eye opening, fast paced read this is the book for you.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I've been a fan of these guys since their first album, and I was impressed by how much they improved between each consecutive album.  The third offering, 'City of Evil', carries along in the tradition of pushing the envelope and taking things to the next level.  There are certainly some big changes that have taken place since 'Waking the Fallen'.<br /><br />A lot of fans just couldn't make the transition - especially with regards to M. Shadow's decision to ditch the screaming and use clean vocals for almost the entirety of the album.  Although I don't agree with how Avenged handled the disappointment of their long-time fans in the press with the release of 'City of Evil', I have to say that it does bring attention to one thing:  These guys are young.  And although they might not be emotionally mature, yet, they certainly are musically mature.<br /><br />Every track on 'City of Evil' is dense and richly complex.  Even on 'Seize the Day', which is the straightforward acoustic ballad song, you can hear phenomenal sweep picking and tapping guitar work going on.  Sidewinder ends with a rad acoustic guitar solo, and the orchestral arrangements on Strength of the World are extremely powerful and poignant.  The percussive work certainly doesn't lag behind the guitars - and is most notable on the fast-paced rockers, Beast and the Harlot, Burn it Down and Trashed and Scattered.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite albums to come out in 2005, and is truly an American masterpiece.  The comparisons to G 'n R are certainly merited, but I don't think that takes away from the originality and incredible amount of talent that was poured into this album.  A worthy purchase, indeed.

0007105045|5.0|I regret that this isn't currently in print, and it baffles me that this is so when Christopher and the estate seem to be printing everything else they can lay their hands on. (Not to say that's a bad thing!)<br /><br />Tolkien's essay reveals the value or role of fairy stories for those who may be fantasy-challenged. Children already know that there are dragons. Fairy tales don't scare children by telling them this terrible secret. The role of the fairy tale is to reveal that dragons can be killed. The dragon is the catastrophe. The slaying of the dragon is the eucatastrophe.<br /><br />Tolkien also notes that we are all subcreators, that it is a natural role for us. (I think he was writing about other authors but anyone who daydreams a story is creating as well.)<br /><br />The best part of this book is \\"Leaf by Niggle.\\" Tolkien wrote several short stories and I love them all, but this is a very special short story. In my opinion, Tolkien was writing about himself during a particularly clear moment of spiritual discernment.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the plot but suffice it to say that the main character, Niggle, is working on a huge painting of an immense tree, filled with detail that grows in detail the more he paints. He would love to finish the painting but he has a neighbor who interrupts him repeatedly with some very real if down-to-earth needs.<br /><br />And that's just the premise. The story just gets better and better, and I hope that it is all true. \\"True\\", not \\"real\\".<br /><br />Please buy a used copy while you can, and treasure it.<br /><br />Sherry Thompson (no matter who Amazon thinks I am)

0618680004|5.0|Dawkins is clearly a genius. He has said in exactly the words I would like to be able to say it in, exactly what I would like to say about what religion can and does do to education, children, families, cultures, and governments. How dangerous is religion? I lost mine when at age 20 I read The Upanishads, Breath of the Eternal, by Swami Prabhavanandi. It was, as I soon discovered, my last effort to find a religion I could believe in. I was baptized Lutheran, schooled at the Church of Christ in summer bible school, attended the Church of the Nazarene (and many others), and many of my friends were Catholics (I even married 2 of them). Then I read Lucretius. That seemed to settle it once and for all - I finally found comfort in knowing that I would someday die and not go to hell. What a revalation! What an epiphany! I became an atheist and it was great. I also became a scientist and the whole meaning of life came to me, scientifically. B. F. Skinner and the radical behaviorism of the 60s helped refine the process by providing tools by which behavior could be examined sensibly with science to back it up. Thank you Dr. Dawkins for helping me bring closure to the process. There are a great many explanations for Bushism and the current zeitgeist but The God Delusion seems to bring it all together quite well. The beauty of the book is that you don't have to BELIEVE by faith, you can examine what what he said by reading history, science, and even doing your own research. You don't have to accept it simply because he is intelligent and convincing - you can examine what he says and test it. I would urge all readers to do that and let's get religion out of politics before we do find Armageddon (and that might make some religious nuts happy for a minute or less). This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read (I read an average of 10-20 books monthly - and I'm 68 years old).
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|One of the rare films that respected the book. I feel the best American novel EVER! The film respected Stinebeck's genius.
B000N6TX22|5.0|Children of Men is one of the better movies that I have seen lately. It looks great in HD. Very good storyline, good acting and excellent visuals. I would definitely recommend it.
B000W7FDBM|5.0|This movie was just the beginning of the Harry Potter sagas.  It captivated my interest and I couldn't wait for the next movie.  It was true to the book!!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My grandson and I have seen this movie several times and he and I just love it. The animation is just wonderful
B000RJO578|2.0|After thoroughly enjoying Shaun of the Dead and reading the praising reviews for Hot Fuzz I expected a funny, entertaining film. This comedic story concept could have worked but it seemed like the writer(s) settled on the first half-baked concept they thought of at every story line turn. Especially the goofy, head-scratching ending. My one-word review for this film: Moronic.
B00104W8T6|5.0|The cd has even more awesome songs than were apparent in the film.  I have listened it continuously for a month now.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loved the offbeat humor of the movie.
B000PFUA9G|4.0|i pretty much bought this cd without knowing much about it. I've never been disappointed with anything by Brad Paisley, so i know its a safe bet. and it was. Not my favortie of his, but still great.
B00006RIO7|4.0|The cd is very good.  There are only songs, no speaking parts really, even ones that precede certain songs. There are a couple of songs that are not in the movie or that were inspired by the movie.  The first time you listen to it if you haven't read the fine print it kind of throws you for a loop.  I highly recommend it for all who love the movie!
630514415X|4.0|Good movie if your my generation basketball fan brings me back lol. They actually offered the role first to Allen Iverson who turned it down!
B000E1ZBH2|4.0|For those who are avid fans of the book and the A&E version you at first may not like this one.  At first one is compelled to think that it is not correct in its adaptation.  My personal thoughts are that it captures the \\"feelings\\" of the characters and allows them to portray them much more than a literal telling of the story would.  And indeed it does not add anything not in the book, it on some things rearranges the location of an event.
B000A59PMO|5.0|If you like Veronica mars, you will love to see how it all kicks off in this great first season of the populare series.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|This is Blade Runner the way it was meant to be seen - in all it's HD glory!<br />The Final Cut is finally complete film and it is a pleasure to watch. The HD DVD is gorgeous and sounds like you are watching it in a theater. I highly recommend this set and for the price you can not go wrong. Plus you have the other 4 versions of the films to show off to your BR-pruist snob friends.
0307387178|5.0|As the last page was read, tears were streaming down our faces.  Reading aloud to my husband as we travel makes the journeys we often take by car seem less tedious. The miles we were traveling had slipped by unnoticed. In Jon Krakauer's writing we found not only a nature/adventure story with a tragic ending, but an exposing glimpse of a universal longing we all have to conquer the unknown.  While nature draws us and provides the stark, unpredictable setting, I believe Kraukaer has aptly shone a light on the real force that drives human beings, such as Chris McCandless.  The author's weaving of his own story and that of others with the same ilk, reveals that the unknown we long to conquer is that which lies within us.  It may be that only by separating ourselves from the noise of our lives, plunging into  an uncontollable environment, and being forced to live only by the inner resources provided by our Creator can we find out that seemingly unknowable thing about ourselves.  Chris's story, as told by Krakauer, appears to have ended with that discovery.  In addition, I feel that there is a univerality to relationships in this story that we experience deeply.  We cried as the son who never got to say to his parents what was in his heart and as the parents who have been left without embracing their child.  Be prepared to be touched in unexpected ways.
0880796863|4.0|I thought I was done with the Waite Tarot, having given my original deck to my girlfriend and ever since I'd been an avid user of Crowley's Thoth deck. But this classic deck has tempted me ever since, I couldn't help but miss the stark simplicity of it all.    I'll admit, when I first opened up this pack I was sorely disappointed. I actually purchased it at a local metaphysical bookstore and, ironically, it was the only deck there that didn't have a sample pack for customers to examine before buying. I went ahead and bought it, since every picture online of this deck looked so clean, clear, and even. Well...    The first card I saw was \\"The Fool\\", and was taken aback at how similar it looked to the first version of this deck I bought (black & blue plaid backing verson). \\"The Magician\\" was also disapointingly similar to that deck. The tiny orange speckles used for pigment were a major turn off as well. But, it was too late. The celophane was removed, it was my deck now.    After taking it home, shuffling it, and laying them out, I almost immediately changed my mind. Within the first spread was the 6 of swords; the color shading on this card is really quite beautiful. The light blue backgrounds on cards such as the 2 of swords and The Universe are soft and antiquiated. Overall the deck kind of reminds me of the \\"vintage\\" version of Monopoly... which I really don't mind at all.    No, this deck isn't perfect. Then again, neither were the original drawings. I suppose I was expecting a drastic shift from the traditional, very poorly colored pack. I personally do not like the fresh and polished look of the Universal Waite deck or any of its variations. This 'Original Rider-Waite' is the closest one can get to a classical looking version of the Waite Tarot.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE isn't golden.  Expectations were high after Cate Blanchett's first foray in 1998 as Elizabeth I, but somehow this follow-up film, with the same director (Shekhar Kapur) and writer (Michael Hirst with assistance from William Nicholson), does not reach those heights.  Visually stunning, with an endless array of knockout costumes for Blanchett, special effects and scenery as majestic as any that have been photographed by fine cinematographer Remie Adefarasin and a musical score by Craig Armstrong and AR Rahman - all of these fine attributes cannot cover the weak script and the general lack of character development that hampers the usually exceptional core of actors.<br /><br />The portion of Elizabeth's history covered by the film is the battle with Spain, England being the only country not participating in the Holy War in Europe under the direction of King Philip II of Spain (Jordi Moll&agrave;), complete with the surprise decimation of the approaching Spanish Armada due to the heroism and commitment of Elizabeth with her people.  The surrounding events include Elizabeth's dalliance with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) and the traumatic (for Elizabeth) beheading of Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton), under the advisement of Elizabeth's trusted Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush).<br /><br />Blanchett is a consummate actress and manages to inhabit the persona of Elizabeth as much with her glances and body language and silences as with  the meager material from the script.  She IS a Queen reborn.  The remainder of the cast is adequate though shallow, and while each has very little to say they maintain an atmosphere of Elizabethan England.  This is a DVD that could well be watched without the soundtrack and still be entertaining for the visual splendors. It could have been so much more. Grady Harp, February 08
0765318741|1.0|... of reading the story. I found it thin and unconvincing. The \\"vampire\\" stuff is highly implausible, and the ending -- I'll not reveal it in a review -- sentious and pretentious.
B00008WT5E|5.0|As a am a listener of various types of music, I want to say the availability of music is great and the service is exceptional.  There is not much more I can say, except...thank you!
B000002UVX|5.0|This CD is a chance to hear a different, funkier Jimi with the Band of Gypsys. No better or worse than great performances with The Experience, just different and one I personally prefer to the work he did with The Experience. Overall, the CD is great. You can never be disappointed with a Hendrix performance. He always delivers.
B000EWBKKI|4.0|Even though I've seen this movie I decided to trade up to Blu-ray, since it was a good price. Looks & sounds great. Now I will wait till the prices of others drop a little
B0000009SY|5.0|Joe's Garage is an absolute classic, from one of the finest musical minds the world has ever known.  Yes, this album is a little crude, but it served its purpose in the late 70's and early 80's.  It's just to bad Mr. Zappa is no longer with us as he'd still be contributing in a major way to the music scene.
B000WGN3YM|5.0|As a fan of the band (having all of their CDs back to [[ASIN:B00008PT62 From Gagarin's Point Of View]]) I must say the trio's already wonderful music really comes to life in this live set... I am not usually so enthusiastic with live releases but this one is stellar!
0060987464|5.0|WOW...I bought this book for my 16 yr old son who is obsessed with Marilyn Manson and he begged me to read it...I LOVED it!!!!!...I think I was way too harsh on him..my son wants to be just like him and I was a lil scared....but I think Manson is probably one of the sanest people in the world....
B000W7JWUA|3.0|My husband and I played Settlers of Catan at a friend's house and decided we wanted a copy of our own. It's a great, easy to learn game that even my 8 year old granddaughter has played and had fun. Downside: The board pieces are made from a light-weight cardboard, and we don't think they'll be as durable as some other snap-together board games, such as Descent and Doom.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|I'm a fan of Pixar movies in general but this was my first Pixar/Blu-Ray experience.<br />I didn't see this movie in the theater as I wasn't sure I would care for it but being a recent purchaser of a Blu-Ray player and the spectacular reviews (for Video and Audio quality) I decided to purchase it without having previously seen the movie.<br /><br />Let me tell you I was in for a treat. The movie was funny, sad, and humorous. Why should I have been surprised?<br /><br />But the HD quality of this movie astounded me. I mean come on, it's only animation.<br />Let's just say that the very first scenes of this movie blew me away.<br />I could've sworn we were looking at a real house in the rain. (Ok, ok, you could tell it wasn't a real house but the detail was phenomenal.)<br /><br />So, for HiDef, this movie is an A+.<br />For Story. Def. A possibly A+.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|Nice video and plenty long.  It was a great concert, and the quality of the recording is supremo, especially if you play it through a HD upconverting player and watch it on a HDTV. Absolutely brilliant video and sound!!!<br /><br />The only thing that is keeping me from giving it 5 stars is simply prejudice - I am a classical guitarist and there was not a single classical player in the entire concert.  There was a sitar player who played on forever - please stop already!!! AND that's NOT a guitar! It's a SITAR! Not even a hint of a classical guitarist.  But, nonetheless, it's very entertaining, and the concert was for a very good cause - help for drug/alcohol abuse.
B0000262QW|5.0|When I first heard this album, I didn't know what to expect.  I had trouble getting into it the first few times, because honestly, what most people consider a splendid delicate build up in jazzy musical themes, I thought was just very boring and pointless noodling.    However, I was wrong.    I now consider all that \\"pointless noodling\\" some very fine instrumental playing.  Inexperience can really change things (for the worse) when it comes to music, and I had to find out the hard way just what it's like to miss out on some sophisticated musical themes.    This album has a frighteningly empty and quiet winter theme throughout the entire thing.  It's especially evident on the title song.  Wow, those chilly vocals and quiet atmospheric bits!  It's like being lost somewhere in Antarctica!    \\"What Game Shall We Play Today\\" stands apart from the rest of the album since it's a short and happy pop song, similar to Paul Simon's \\"See Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\\".    \\"Sometime Ago\\" is just a MONSTER build-up in musical themes and atmospheric passages.  At first it seems like the first half of the 23-minute track is just pointless jamming, while the second half is the meat and potatoes of the album.  But you know, with repeated listens, it's revealed the entire thing works together well.  For me to believe this song WASN'T a masterpiece the first time I heard it just went to show how inexperienced I was with this kind of music.  It most certainly is a brilliant composition.    Worth owning!
B000N6TYLW|4.0|I haven't had time to watch the series yet but since I enjoyed all the rest, I'm sure I'll love this one too.  I was very pleased with the prompt delivery.

B000U66PK8|5.0|Gordon Ramsays' book has made many of his previously misunderstood actions  comprehensible to me.  His face is like a map of his past;and reading of his childhood explained much and elicited my sympathy for that little boy who would become so driven.  Ther are lessons to be learned throughout about cooking,and the perfect way to approach and perform the skills needed.The book is very easy to read,full of explanations,and it has given me an entirely different outlook on restaurants and how they function.  A quite enjoyable read,all in all.

031286504X|5.0|while the movie was coming out i decided to do some research on it. i didn't want to get the new edition of the book because i figured they'd be watered down with loads of crap to apeall to a more MODERN, public... so i decided to go strait to the source and get the original. this book is very exciting you will not be able to put this down.

B000022TSY|5.0|Easy Rider captures a time and spirit in America when the people on the left were the voices of true liberation, individuality and total freedom while those on the right stood for thought control and conformity.  My how times have changed.  Now the lefties are all about political correctness and repressive government taxes and regulations and the rightists \\"say\\" they want less intrusive government even though they are building a police state to protect us from enemies we can't seem to find. Basically, the home of the brave and the land of the free the two main characters were trying to find in this movie is even harder to find today.  This is partly why the themes in this movie should actually be seen as timeless even though the action takes place in a very abbreviated time in our history.  In fact, the story line has a Don Quixote quality to it that may not seem obvious to those who did not live in the 60's and share the initial dream of a utopian hippe society.  It is a movie about idealism though it may not seem like it on first viewing. In fact, if you did not live in this era you might find the whole premise of the film challenging because the values it celebrates are so thoroughly buried today.  For those of you who don't \\"get\\" this movie, here's the deal:  The boys start out buying drugs from some poor Mexicans and selling them to a rich dude to finance their freedom.  Not necessariy the best way to budget for a road trip, but definitley an anti-establishment approach to financial liberation in days when most drug deals were between friends and violence wasn't a factor. With the proceeds of this transaction, they purchase their freedom in the form of two beautiful custom chopper motorcycles they ride throughout the movie.  After Wyatt throws his watch in the dust and he and Billy hop on their rides - today they are probably the two most recognized bikes in the world - their search for true freedom in America begins. This is why they are on motorcycles in thefirst place, riding through the empty expanses of the southwest, visiting a small ranch (a conventional approach to a sort of independence) and a hippie commune(a non conventional approach that doesn't work out so well either).   When the two meet up with Nicholson, they find a lost soul who also longs to escape the confines of his environment by joining the hippies, but ultimately can't escape his local culture.  As great as Jack's role is, he is merely a prop in the overall story to illustrate the complex emmotions and reactions society had about the 60's counter culture as embodied in Wyatt and Billy.  The bordelo and drug sequence too is about exploring and exploding two of the most sacred myths of the hippie movement. This is the idea that free sex and drugs are liberating to the human spirit.  Our friends find that ultimately they are not. Instead they see the experience as confusing and hurtful and lead Wyatt to say \\"they blew it\\" after the episode is done.    This movie is ultimatley a tragedy as everyone who has seen it knows, just as the hippie movement itself was a beautiful dream that ended in tragedy for many in our society.   The folk and psychodelic rock music selected for this film could not be better, and the sequences of our protagonists cruising the open roads of northern Arizona and New Mexico to the sounds of Steppenwolf's \\"Born to Be Wild\\" and Hendrix's \\"If Six Were Nine\\" are among the most unforgetable on film.
B0002KQNUO|1.0|Bought the album because I liked the title track \\"Alegria\\" when I first heard it on the web. Exotic with a touch of decadence....<br />Pity that most of the other tracks were not up to standard.<br /><br />End Result: disapointment<br />  Moral: don't buy entire album judging from just one track, because you might be in for an unpleasant surprise.....<br />  Caveat: De gustibus e de coloribus non est disputandum
0761145613|5.0|I love this calender. There's lot of room to keep track of all the activities and events for the family. This is my second year buying one and I don't think I will go back to the traditional calender again...the vertical layout is great!
B000005J56|5.0|originally I would not have picked this up for myself, but a friend gave it to me, and this was in the beginning  before they were well known. now I am giving it myself to others who somehow never learned about it. it is tremendous music and the DVD is totally worth watching, Ry Cooder did a terrific service to humanity. like his Timbucktu (sp?) album of afropop.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is the best music movie I've ever seen!  A sweet, thoughtful movie that showcases the talent brilliantly.  Unlike others that offer too much over-the-top glitz.  Very well done!!!!

B000OLGCI4|5.0|A totally joyous ride and a classic.  The Bear Necessities of Life- (yes that's where the song comes from ).  My young boys love it and I really enjoy watching it with them.
B000WGZGNS|4.0|Wow! I was amazed by her performance for two hours straight.She's a true professional in everything she does. I attended her concert when she came in town but seeing her on tv is great.Saw a few things that I've missed.  It is worth the price.Cant wait for her new cd.
B000087F5X|5.0|When I first saw this movie I rewinded it and watched it again. Everything is so great about this movie, from costumes, acting, cinema-photography and most importantly the music!!!  The way the director tells the story is simply so captivating. I had never really liked classical music until I saw this movie. educational.  The cast is perfect in every way. A must see, must have movie.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Firstoff I'd like to say that this movie deserves awards if it doesn't already have some, second, this movie was great, probably one of the few movies with a decent soundtrack, recommend to anyone who loves music and a good story.
B000P12LWY|4.0|The most important thing to say to the average viewer who likes something with a lot of intrigue, the level of sex you'd expect from pay cable, and wants something to watch other than reality shows, will enjoy this series.<br /><br />I believe it to be well worth the money spent.<br /><br />Recently, pay cable networks have been coming up with a certain type of programming that really is suited for adults. They're taking advantage of the part of the market that wants a little more skin and scandal.<br /><br />In point of fact, compared to the level of explicit detail and language in a show like Deadwood, The Tudors is tame. There is some soft core female nudity, and one scene of self-pleasure. There is actually less sex than I would have expected.<br /><br />The show works as a story about a man who started out good, and them power corrupted him. His personal desires, sexual needs, and desire for immortality/an heir causes him to be unconscionably cruel. The people around him, almost without exception, are obsessed with getting close to this powerful man in order to further their own agendas. And there is at least one beautiful scheming woman. And one woman who is a martyr.<br /><br />In short, it's a soap opera.<br /><br />One of the most interesting and consistent criticisms is that the series is very inaccurate, and I believe it's important for people to state that to allow others to make an informed decision. This will be a frustrating show if you're an expert on the Tudors, and want to see a show that is factually beyond reproach.<br /><br />However, I think some of the people criticizing the show, fearing people will be walking around thinking Henry had only once sister and she killed a husband, are giving people little credit, and missing the real possibility that an entertained viewers might take the time to learn more.<br /><br />I knew the bare basics of the time frame, but from the first episode -- and I'm about to label myself a geek -- I began to look up the real story online. I would see an event and wonder if it were true. And I ordered books as well. I knew very little about Henry VIII before I started watching the show, and it made me interested enough to find out a whole lot more.<br /><br />I'm still not like those people who have the family tree memorized! :)<br /><br />I never expected a show meant to entertain and titillate to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I expect the history channel to give it to me straight -- not Showtime, so I took everything with a grain of salt.<br /><br />So, highly recommend the series, while also agreeing with the history buffs that the real story is worth knowing and just as interesting in its own right! The former is yummy mind candy and the latter is food for thought.were true. And I ordered books as well.

Its a great book with no complexity and its a pleasent short read with plenty of valuable nuggets and insights along the way.  I also have the audio version on my ipod which is great on a long walk!!!
B00000099Y|5.0|This is the  best album of there's and the best album of all time so far.  Tool is more than just an average band.  They stretch your mind to actually think.  This is not casual entertainment, this is important art.  If you think you don't like it, listen again.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I'm not familiar with Ms. Taymor's other films but I really enjoyed her Across the Universe--a unique take on a collection of popular Beatles' songs. The look of this film at times was intoxicating and I liked the various unique versions of the songs. Being a Beatles fan myself this is the first musical in that I was familiar with almost all the songs (the only other being the amazing Moulin Rouge--which at times I was reminded of while watching this.) Recommended.
B000YPUFA6|4.0|Lots of action, great effects. I liked the whole Resident Evil series and now own them all on Blu-Ray Disc. Crystal clear picture and the Lossless sound is mind blowing. If you like Action- Science-Fiction you will like this.
B000NVL9KG|5.0|I picked the newer remaster up used a couple of days ago and it is a nice sounding piece of prog rock history.    The B3 is sharp and distinctive and the drums are tight and clean.    If you are an ELP fan,then adding this to your collection is a no-brainer.    It is such a drag to have a decent sound system and be forced to listen to flat and muddy sounding recordings.    This is an exception.

B000K7UG34|5.0|Most people who buy this movie have seen it. So this is not an issue. What I found very important is; that it plays in europe on PS3.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I know this theater show got a bad review in 2005 when it came out, and I can understand that.  Here is the reason why, in my opinion anyway.  It is not a movie where some of us can comprehend with one viewing.  After we viewed it once, we then saw the Pilgrim Notes, so we turned them on an watched it again.  We then understood the movie a lot better.  But unless you are 25 years old and can watch text and the movie pass by at the same time, then the 2 time viewing is necessary.  Then go the the 2nd DVD and view all the directors comments and the Hollywood versus history trailers.  It actually takes ablout 3 nights to watch it all, but by doing this, you will have a much better understanding of this time in history and how it ties into present day issues in Israel and other parts of the Middle East.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My husband and I love this movie!  We don't have kids, but find it is great for adults too!  It takes you awhile to overcome the thought of rats in the kitchen, but these little guys quickly become lovable and acceptable!
B0013AT0CU|5.0|I bought the dvd version of this album a year and a half ago and loved it like I like an album only a few times a year - listened to it ten times in a row and to the exclusion of doing things loved it.  Well loved the music portion of it anyways, the dvd features aren't really worth it honestly.    You can get the gist of what this album is from the other reviews, I merely offer a vote of support.  To put it in perspective, after I listened to it over and over again for months I moved.  And lost the dvd.  And dropped and broke my ipod.  After not being able to find it on emusic I am willing to yet again drop over $12 to have it again.    If you like hardcore but INNOVATIVE punk pay for it, if you don't have money then pirate it.  But listen to this, seriously.

B000CNDIZE|5.0|I was up late watching Conan O'Brien show and SIA was the featured artist. The song I heard isn't on this album but none the less this album grew on me. There is one song that has been used in many films and TV shows and it's still one of my fav's. This album reminds me of Dido mixed with a little cranberries. I think the recordings are great and the mix was done very well. This album is a great ride all the way through.
B000VR824S|5.0|After ordering the DVD crossroads 2004 I knew I had to have this one as well. Iam a huge eric clapton fan and these DVD's are THE BEST!!!!  They are very entertaining too!

0765357151|5.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" is only the first half of the book. The book is a collection of short stories written by Richard Matheson and it doesn't indicate that on the cover or anywhere else. Anyway, it's a great book that hard to put down, far better than the movie. Don't stop at IAL though, read the whole thing, there are lots of gems in this one. Highly recommended.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie has to be one of the best foreign movies I've ever seen. It's easy to follow (especially if you know your history) and it always makes me cry!! It has everything you want in a great movie: Love, drama, comedy, and history.
0740748475|5.0|This is a fantastic collection!  If you grew up when this was in print, you probably remember it with great fondness.  It maintains a certain amount of insight while remaining genuinely funny.  Buy this!

Very well acted, directed, costumed, and a great escape on those cold winter nights.  If you don't mind a little adult content, i highly recommend this series.  Cudos to Showtime for making such a great series.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|This is such a great movie and Criterion's remastered edition is perfect. I have not watched all of the extras, yet, but am enjoying the ones I have seen. One of the interviews is not the greatest but the information about Kurowsawa is interesting. I have no regrets getting this film and consider it one of the best. I don't know what it is about foreign films that make them so good. The story development is engaging and the acting makes you feel like you are watching a real-life event. The movie seemed a lot shorter than it was since it was so interesting. Of couse I just watch a 5-hour Criterion Collection of Les Miserables so I might be biased! I highly recommend this movie and intend to watch it many more times.
B0002W18MU|5.0|CD arrived in excellent condition.  If you buy this, be prepared to hear a Johnny Cash we never knew.  I could feel the heartache of deceased spouse.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|ST-TOS Remastered is magnificent!  The images are cleaner than when the programs were first broadcast-I was there.  It sounds better, it looks better, and with great CGI effects, these programs are so much better than ever before.    I don't have an HD-DVD player or HD monitor yet, but the SD content is stunning.  I'm way more likely to go HD soon because of what the other side of each of these discs offer.  Clear, rich colors, crisp sound and a squeaky-clean digital transfer make these episodes vibrant and fresh.  The re-imagined effects add depth and impact; no more \\"flashing light indicating some alien space ship\\", no more muddy, fuzzy animated phaser beams, no more \\"we only have 15 stock shots of the Enterprise.\\"  Instead of what have been called \\"cheesy\\" effects by people brought up on Star Wars (or even 2001) and other very high budget theatrical productions, current state of the art computer animation, from exterior shots of ships to displays and phaser beams make the remastered TOS episodes as current and fresh as tomorrow's Battlestar Galactica episode.    For anyone who's skipped Star Trek because they thought it was lame, keep in mind that the original series was produced for a pittance-and still won awards.  Keep in mind that it tackled serious social issues at a time when television was the purest of escapism.  And keep in mind that if it weren't for the original series we probably wouldn't have Stargate, BSG, Buffy, or really any other science fiction or fantasy series on television.  Take a look at what Star Trek should have looked like in 1966 and 67, and see why it built such a huge fan base.  Enjoy!
B000002VCT|4.0|The Alan Parson's Project (APP) goes pop and new age in their 1978 release, \\"Pyramid.\\"  This is the 3rd album by APP, following \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" and \\"I Robot\\".  It did not, as another reviewer commented, earn the same critical reviews as \\"I Robot.\\"  It does, however, retain the APP focus on concept albums.  This one is pyramidism, a new age concept that was quite popular in the 1970s.<br /><br />As for the music in this album, it clearly expresses the established APP sound developed in APP's first two offerings.  \\"Pyramid\\", however, lacks some of the strong focus of \\"Tales of Mystery...\\", and the harder-driving impulses of \\"I Robot.\\"  It is, nevertheless, at least in my opinion, a very good album.<br /><br />If you like APP instrumentals, then check out \\"Voyager\\", \\"Lap of the Gods\\", and \\"Hyper-gamma-spaces\\".  \\"Voyager\\" has a strong techno-foundation, somewhat like \\"A Dream Within a Dream\\", while \\"In the Lap of the Gods\\" is stronger and more brooding, like \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\".  \\"Hypre-gamma-spaces\\" is also techno-driven, but is much more upbeat and is an excellent piece of arrangement and engineering.<br /><br />Gentle reflective, even melancholy, pieces include \\"What Goes Up...\\", \\"The Eagle Will Rise Again\\", and \\"Shadow of a Lonely Man.\\"  So, if you liked \\"To One In Paradise\\" or \\"Don't Let It Show\\" from the first two albums, you'll probably like these.<br /><br />APP makes its first real pop offerings on this album.  The pop sound comes through most clearly on \\"Can't Take it With You\\" and \\"Pyramania.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, APP did not desert their rock roots entirely, and included one track that has a driving sound.  Check out \\"One More River\\".  Though that track is not as strong as the rock tracks on either of their first two albums, this is a good song.<br /><br />In short, this album offers something for just about anyone, makes for good background music, and sounds excellent with headphones - which was a big deal when this music first came out.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good APP album, but not on par with their very best, thus the 4 star rating.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album, but it's not the place to start out if you want to see what APP is all about.  For that try \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\", \\"I Robot\\", \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\", or \\"Eye in the Sky.\\"<br /><br />Alan Holyoak, 30+ year APP listenerlbum, but not on par with their very best, thus the 4 star rating.      I highly recommend this album, but it's not the place to start out if you want to see what APP is all about.  For that try \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\", \\"I Robot\\", \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\", or \\"Eye in the Sky.\\"    Alan Holyoak, 30+ year APP listener
B000001DVD|5.0|What can be said about this album that hasn't been said before.  At the cusp of being a teenager, my friend found some cassettes at a park.  He gave me this album and heard it.  Then I heard it again. And again.  I was hypnotized.  I didn't know it at the time, but I was listening to one of the top hard rock albums of all time.  For almost all rock bands, for reasons I shall not get into, their first or second albums are their greatest work.  Most rock critics like to use the tired phrase \\"their early work was best\\" to describe most band's output.  But in this case, it is absolutely undisputed.  Their second album is undeniably raw and engaging.  Their riffs on Switch 625 are practically unparallelled.  This was a piece of work where band members where clearly trying to please themselves.  At the time, this was a band that was clearly not trying to turn their work into a commercial success.  This is what you get before you get discovered.  Even the album Pyormania was excellent, but was not as raw as this album.  Pyromania was much more refined.  What do you get when you get a garage band and put them into a studio, all the while telling them that this work will never be heard by anyone else?  You get \\"High and Dry\\".  Enjoy.

087033039X|4.0|Leather Braiding is a shortened version of Bruce Grant's Encyclopedia of Rawhide and Leather Braiding and is excellent for learning a variety of braiding techniques.  His step-by-step written and drawn instructions are invaluable.    I strongly recommend this book.
B000FZERIG|4.0|I've waited a long time for this remastered \\"deluxe\\" edition.  It looks very nice, but the sound is, sadly, not a big improvement over the original vinyl, particularly on the title track.  This is still one of George's best albums; he was still on a post-Beatles roll.  The songwriting is thinner than ATMP, it is definitley preachy (but so was ATMP), but the production has a straight-forward I find refreshing after the ATMP extravaganza.  It's just too bad that it was not spectaclularly remastered, as I thought the Dark Horse titles were.  Considering the great job on the Lennon remasters as well, I guess I was spoiled.  It's nice to have this, I just wish they really would have done it justice, as I wish they would do with the Beatles' material.

0735619670|5.0|I started by reading the first edition of this book. I got the second edition when I was almost finished with the first edition of this book.    After getting the new version of the book I decided to continue reading the old one because I found that there are quite a few differences between the old and the new edition.     This is perhaps one of the best books that I have ever read on programming in my life. The author Steve McConnell has put together a book that is independent of what ever programming language that is used.  In the authors words.  He wanted to write a good book on software construction because he had looked around and had not found any good books out there on the subject.  I would have to agree with him there are not a lot of books on good programming technic.  There are hundreds of books on this programming language or that programming language.     Code complete is so good that I feel every programmer should read it.  It would be best if in the first year of college every single student read the book.  I just don't know how it could fit into a regular curriculum.  Even if it does not fit that well into a regular curriculum what is taught in this book is probably more important then what most people learn at school.     I like the book and would advise it to anyone that programs.     I am looking forward to the new edition because the old book didn't have much advice about object oriented programming.  Mostly because it was a new way of programming when the book was first written and he didn't want to commit much information to it when object oriented programming was so new.  He does talk a little about things that are outdated but the book is still one of the best.     I will wait a while before I read the second edition but I expect to be as satisfied with it as I was this one.     Great book that should be in every programmers library.

0451147960|1.0|My copy of The Gemini Contenders was part of an order of ten books in early January. I chose to read two other books before getting to The Gemini Contenders, so the complaint I am about to write is too late for a refund from Amazon.    I read through page 288 in my copy of The Gemini Contenders when I was suddenly confronted by page 273 of an entirely different book, A Stranger in the Family by Steven Naifen and Gregory White Smith! The typeface of this book is different from that of Ludlum's book.    A Stranger in the Family continues to page 364, and then The Gemini Contenders resumes at page 321 and goes to page 384, where it is interrupted once more at page 369 of A Stranger in the Family, which terminates at page 400.    So I received incomplete parts of two books bound together in the cover of The Gemini Contenders! Maybe this \\"book\\" will turn out to be a valuable object, sought after by collectors of publishing freaks. But I just wanted a good read of a continuous individual title. If it's not too late, I'd like to receive a normal copy of The Gemini Contenders.    William Moriarty

I pre-ordered it and watched it in just a couple of days. It was definitely a triumph of a series, and I'm glad I got it, sight unseen!
B000N3SSVM|5.0|Disc and DVD compilation that lives up the music.  The DVD alone is worth twice the price (having all the music videos they've ever made in one place, as well as a high quality live recording!).
B0000AUHPK|5.0|Of all the versions of this story I have seen, this is one of the best; acting was superior and was faithful to the original story. I would recommend this version of the story to anyone who has never seen any of them.
B000WC3AOE|5.0|This is an ideal DVD for anyone who likes old musicals. I am not a big fan myself and thought it would be more about old movies in general. Be that as it may the DVD looks great and there are a lot of trivia and special features. I really didn't like this stuff as a kid but I find I'm pretty impressed with the kind of energy these performers had. There is more work going on in these films than anything we have today. If I had understood before buying that it was about musicals I wouldn't have botherd. After seeing it now I'd say there's an 80% chance I'd replace it if someone got away with my copy and that's saying a lot.

I bought it after hearing about it on NPR, figuring that I'd read it and then pass it on to a child.....but I'm thinking now that I'll keep it and buy another one to give!
0143038419|1.0|I did not like this book AT ALL!! I thought it was going to be so great, based on what I had heard and I was so disappointed. Were I not so Type A and a person who hates to leave anything unfinished, I would have put this book down after the first 20 or so pages. To be frank, I didn't become the least bit interested until the last 3rd of the book, when she got to Indonesia. My book club is reading this for February, so I am anxious to see if anyone else disliked it as much as me. Maybe I am not \\"deep\\" enough or enlightened enough, but I thought it was pretty much drivel, as well. Save your time (and money).
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Wow I haven't heard this album in years. Due to their recent reunion tour, minus Michael Anthony(shame on you), with Wolf, Eddie's son, I was really motivated to buy their CD catalogue. I only like the David Lee Roth years. That's real Van Halen. This album just Rocks. Eddies guitar sounds so clean and turned up! Really brings back those cool High School party years. A+++   Who's Sammy???

She works hard for her money and it shows. We are going to see great things from Madonna for many years to come. Go Girl!!

B000OVLNII|5.0|I first picked up Doris Kearns Godwin's \\"A Team of Rivals\\" thinking I'd be perusing yet another rehash of the Lincoln Presidency and the challenges he faced (and overcame) throughout the Civil War years. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this was not the case, and soon became enthralled as I delved deeper into the book.<br /><br />Ms. Godwin's research and writing not only dig deeply into the life, intellect and personality of Lincoln, but expertly weaves the lives of his political rivals, Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, William H. Seward and Edward Bates into the narrative. The story is engaging and informative: it reveals new aspects of Lincoln, and does an excellent job of placing him and his accomplishments within the context of the issues, personalities and controversies of the era.<br /><br />I was very interested in how Ms. Godwin analyzes and dissects Lincoln and each of his four rivals for the nomination of 1860: she does not approach the task with a sterile, dry analysis, but works hard to reveal how very human each of them were.  You come to appreciate these men, and their families, - each of them possessed great strengths and weaknesses, each had a huge ego and often volcanic temper. You'll learn about their lives and frames of mind, and how they each became a competitor for the young and brash Republican party's nomination of a Presidential candidate in 1860. You'll then learn how the victor, Lincoln, cajoled each of them to join his administration, then managed to not only contain their often violent and seemingly irreconcilable differences of opinion on major issues, but harness those differences and build consensus as Lincoln sought to hold his relatively fragile and tumultuous Republican coalition together and maintain public support for his administration and policies throughout the course of the War.<br /><br />The author makes the case that if Lincoln had been anything less than a master of politics, negotiation and communication; if he had been anything other than a great consensus builder who refused to commit himself to a course of action (such as the Emancipation Proclamation,) until he was certain in his heart the country was ready for it, then the War and its costs in lives and resources would have quickly become unpopular, which would probably have resulted in him becoming an even more ignominious failed President than has his predecessor, James Buchanan.<br /><br />I enjoyed every page of this book. The author does an excellent job of revealing the motives, shortcomings and challenges that Lincoln and each of his rivals faced on each step of the road they travelled together. You realize that Lincoln was a great President not just because he himself was a great leader, but because, as a leader, he was able to inspire and bring out greatness in others.<br /><br />So, I've gone from a somewhat doubtful initial interest to really appreciating the research and effort Doris Kearns Godwin has put into this book, and her skill at weaving a compelling, informative and fascinating tale.<br /><br />Five Stars!er than a great consensus builder who refused to commit himself to a course of action (such as the Emancipation Proclamation,) until he was certain in his heart the country was ready for it, then the War and its costs in lives and resources would have quickly become unpopular, which would probably have resulted in him becoming an even more ignominious failed President than has his predecessor, James Buchanan.

B000PFU7OO|4.0|For those who may not have seen the film Once, I thought it was one of the better dramas released last year.  Film that are character and storyline driven always have a place in the heart's of the public, regardless of budget expenditures.  Once is a beautiful film whose soundtrack provides beautiful yet hauntingly melodical Irish/Indie alt tunes that continue to stir emotions within me when I listen to them every day.  Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova connect creating beautifully put together compilations.  Irglova's angelic voice displays a timbre of sadness while Hansard's imaginative guitar melodies and vocal arrangements are ingenious.  If you are into a non-manipulative love story that strays from the prototypical American tale, I recommend picking up both the film and the soundtrack.

This is one of those rare albums where every single song is amazing, and you can listen to it without having to touch your \\"skip track\\" button.  While \\"Fast As You Can\\" was the biggest hit as a single, songs like \\"A Mistake\\" and \\"To Your Love\\" can only be described as Beatles-esque.  \\"The Way Things Are,\\" \\"Get Gone,\\" and \\"I'll Know\\" are some of the (if not the) most insightful and thoughtful songs about being in an unsatisfying relationship that I've ever heard.  Fiona weaves charming plays-on-words effortlessly into beautiful and vivid storytelling, all set to truly unique musical arrangements.
B000XA5K4I|4.0|This is an all out opera of bullet mayhem! You definitely have to take a break from thinking and just enjoy all of the various ways of firing guns that they came up with.  The story is simple and not very engaging but the action and comedic sequences move the movie along at a frantic pace.     The video picture quality is first rate high definition, right down to the pores in Clive Owen's face.  A good showcase movie for your high definition display.  Sound is strong too with plenty of bass and whizzing bullets panning through your speakers.
B000VNMMQG|1.0|Dark movie. Difficult to see and understand.  Acting was terrific but certainly not intended for light entertainment.  Trailer misleading.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|I loved this movie, I have the original and this new version lived up to the original. It was nice that they kept the movie on track with the first one, usually remakes change story lines or characters. I recommend anyone who enjoyed the first Blade Runner will definetly not be disappointed in The Finasl Cut version.
B000TFINY6|5.0|Season 3 in Blu-ray is more fantastic to the eye. The show continues to come up with new exciting twists and turns. Watching them on DVD allows you to forgo the suspense and skip the commercials and go right to the next episode. The blu-ray looks better and sounds better and it continues to draw millions of viewers for good reason. The character development, the acting and the sci-fi aspects of the show keep it action packed. The struggle is always there and it feeds the human interest.
0143113100|5.0|A simple yet very informative book which sheds new light into how our brain changes with time and how we can keep it active.
B000RZIGSG|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  I love the music.  I love the dancing.  I love the Cinderella story.  Gee, what's not to love.  Definitely a chick flick.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|Eddie Vedder has pulled it off with this one. Great display of work, you can hear the heart of Pearl Jam here. Away from the mumbling jam sessions that we have come to expect of them; Vedder breaks free and gives us some soulful release here.
B000J103YI|5.0|The CD was delivered timely.  The sound quality is excellent.  Sounds as though I'm in the theatre watching the movie.
B000FIMG68|5.0|The show takes many twists and turns. Basically continues the story of Plane crash victims trying to survive and find a way to get rescued when thier plane crashes on a strange island 1000 miles off course. Season 2 shows alot of character development and shows connections between charecters and thier families from before the crash. Gets exciting when the \\"Others\\" People already on the island start kidnapping and doing scientific experiments on the Plane crash victims. All the while the island has some power of its own that only a few can wield and none explain. Def worth the ride.
B000JIHP88|5.0|Fisher Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobile   I bought this for our house so that when my grandson comes to visit, he will have a mobile to sleep by. When my daughter brought him over, she loved it so much that I bought her one and she gave away the one she already had. There are some cool features on this mobile. For example, it has a remote control for turning it on and off. This way, you don't have to enter the room and disturb the sleeping baby. Also, it has a rainforest sound of crickets and other creatures that I find to be very relaxing (there are classical music sounds as well). It has adjustable volume controls and the leaves go up and down. You can tell it is well made and will last for years. I highly recommend this mobile.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Channel-surfing a few weeks ago, I happened upon the second half of the 2006 BBC production of Jane Eyre on Public Television.  I have seen the 1944, 1973, and 1983 film versions, and read the novel numerous times.  The 2006 version is the winner by a mile, for the following reasons: 1. The acting and casting is superb in every instance. 2. This is the first film \\"Jane\\" that looks and acts 18, as well as the first Mr. Rochester that was the right age (according to the novel, \\"just past youth\\", late 30's.) 3.  Filmed entirely on location, complete authenticity in that respect.  4. The first film version where I could believe the costumes. 5.\\"Adele\\" looked French (although the actress was not), she also spoke French perfectly, and her character was portrayed more fully than in other versions. 5. The best presentation of the most important plot points of the novel i.e. good screenplay.  The written word and a film are 2 totally different media.  Film is primarily visual.  This was not a word-for-word reading from the novel, but a skillfull transfer to the visual medium, true to the situations and intense relationships portrayed in the novel.  6. The only film version that not only acknowledges but affirms the Christian content found in the novel.    One flaw, small to the point of insignificance; Blanche Ingram, in the novel, has black hair and dark eyes, not blonde and blue-eyed, as in the film. But the main point is established still, Blanche's beauty, arrogance, and shallowness are portrayed well.  In summary, for the above reasons, this film works! Sit back after a day at work, and watch a magical tale of true love unfold.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Enjoyed watching it very much, think it is one of the best movies I had seen.
B000UX6TRK|5.0|Although he hasn't had a major hit single in almost two decades, this dynamic 2007 concert from Paris finds the great Lionel Richie looking and sounding as good as he did 20 years ago. Lionel has lost none of the talent that made him an R&B/pop superstar in the 1970's and 80's, and his stage presence and enthusiasm for live performance is vividly displayed in this entertaining show. He is a true entertainer who knows how to deliver a vibrant and high-energy show, and his piano playing is also very solid.     Backed by a strong group of musicians, Richie is clearly enjoying himself as much as the audience as he gives them a nice selection of his solo hits and his classics with the Commodores. What sets Richie apart from many R&B stars is his ability to appeal to both black and white audiences by crafting excellent songs with great melodies that blurred the lines between pop and R&B. Lionel is probably the only R&B performer besides Ray Charles to recieve airplay on country music stations as well with great songs like \\"Stuck on you\\" and \\"Deep River Woman\\". The latter song featured country superstars Alabama on backing vocals. Lionel's great love ballad \\"Lady\\" was a number one country hit for Kenny Rogers as well. It would've been nice to hear him perform that song in this concert since Lionel could surely sing it as well or better than Kenny.    Other reviewers here have complained about the sound quality on this DVD, but haven't noticed any problems with the sound on my disc. Despite the fact that a talent like this is no longer allowed on today's top 40 stations, there are enough people out there who still recognize a good thing when they hear it. Richie's latest album just recently earned a gold record and was nominated for a grammy last year. If you are looking for quality pop music by a man who knows how to write it and perform it better than anyone on the charts in 2008, this is the DVD for you.
0060558121|3.0|The story-telling is good, and the characters are well developed.  The imagery is well done, and you get a good feeling for the story and settings.  I found myself a little disappointed, however, that the plot didn't go anywhere more interesting.  The climax was so predictable that I found myself waiting for the next twist, but there wasn't one.  A fun read, but it doesn't make a huge impression.
0525948023|2.0|This is just a rehash of stuff that I've been reading since the early seventies. People can say how wonderful all of this is here online and then go out and cut someone off in traffic and blame the other guy for almost causing an accident and not see the conflict   People are what people are and no amount of cajoling or literary pap is going to change that fact. The unfortunate truth is that the meek and non violent will not inherit the earth,they will instead be trampled underfoot. I've come to accept this as fact even though I don't agree with it.   People need to treat each other with respect and dignity,I do this every day and have taught my children to do the same. I have also taught my children to teach people who do not do so the error of their ways. This is not Ego, this is pragmatism.   In any situation involving more than one person, somebody is the leader. There is always going to be one person who is more equal than another, it's genetic and we can't change that. Yet.
0761145613|5.0|Easy to use.  Comes with stickers  ie:  no school, soccer etc.  Everyone in the family has his or her own column.  Love it!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Lonesome Dove is absolutely the best western movie in history!  I was delighted to get in in DVD, as I already have it on VHS, and get tired of rewinding all four tapes.  We never tire of watching this movie!  Also, the movie that was out this past year (Apache Moon?), in which the main characters of Lonesome Dove are young - was also very well done. The actor who played Gus as a young many portrayed him excellently!  He managed to capture the essence of Robert Duvall perfectly as a young man!
080701429X|4.0|I found the authors experiences in the death camps very interesting and well written. I appreciate my life more every time I read such survival story's. I cannot begin to comprehend how anyone survived these camps considering their exposure to the elements with virtually no food to provide the energy for work or the body warmth/immunity to ward off illness and disease. God Bless Mr. Frankl and all others who survived.  The more psychoanalytical add ons at the end of the book were more in depth than my literary interests or needs at this sector of my life.
0743201140|4.0|Hallo,I bought this book in the first place to improve my english through the sinfull environment,but this book also extends human comprehensions and is helpfull,although everybody doesn't think to solve thus their problems.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I am a huge fan of the show.  The complete third season answered questions from episodes I missed on TV.  Amazon shipped very fast.
0375842209|5.0|THE BOOK THIEF is a fantastic book! It is the kind of book that you pick up and don't put down until you are finnished. The book is well written, and the characters are easy to become attached to. i highly recommend this book to everyone. When you get to the last 50 or so pages I suggest you have a box of tissues near. THE BOOK THIEF is among the best books I have ever read.
B00005JPLW|5.0|BOTTOM LINE:    If you are not looking for balls-out action with sweaty, muscular men destroying mythical-like, demonic-looking bad guys...    then why did you buy this movie in the first place?!  :-)
B000LXH0AE|3.0|It's funny how people on here would rather be lied to than told the truth if it's not what they want to hear. I'm telling you the truth when I say that this is a comedy that isn't funny, a romance that isn't romantic, a sci-fi thriller that isn't scientific or thrilling. Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson fans will be gravely disappointed. Some very clever ideas, especially visual, but it falls apart because of its overall lack of appeal. A more attractive, more romantic lead with comedic overtones and a funny sidekick would have worked better than trying to make Ferrell play it straight and romantic, with only the oddity of his situations to get him laughs. And Thompson is downright depressing. Dustin Hoffman is interesting but still less-than-spectacular as the lit. prof. The fact that the story is totally fantastic and could never happen gives the audience a feeling of \\"so what?\\" Even fantasies have to be believable on some level. So, cleverness is not enough. If it were, this one would be a peach.<br /><br />But, if you'd rather be lied to, this is a fantastic film that rates with Gone With The Wind, Ben-Hur, Braveheart and The Godfather. Buy a dozen copies and give them to your friends.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith
B000P12LWY|5.0|Very well done, great acting, terrific costumes and locations. A little creative rewrites which were not totally historically accurate, but the spirit of the charachters were not altered. I do think they could have left the nudity out and had nuances instead.
B000089RVR|4.0|During my travels I occasionally heard the song White Flag starting in February of 2007.  I found the singer's name and the title of the song, not on the radio - they do not sell records (or CDs) any more.  This CD is great and I like most of the songs on it.  The singer has a very versatile voice, good writers and a great back up band.
0765318741|4.0|Very good book. A lot better than the movie that just came out. One of my favorite stories from this book was mad house.
B000000HHE|5.0|BOTTOM LINE:     Had the CASSETTE when it first dropped back in 1988! (I'm 33 ya'll)  Ad-libs? Cryptic metaphors? Obscure samples? Intros? Skits? 20+ trax? conceptual?  THIS ALBUM STARTED ALL OF THAT. Welcome to the Native Tongues. Oh, and 'wipe your Lottos on the mat'.    A+. A hip-hop Essential.
B000NIVJEU|4.0|Movie was obviously better than standard DVD but I though that it was not the best Blu-ray adaptation I have seen
0143038419|5.0|This is a beautifully written book that has converted a hardcore non-fiction reader like myself into a fiction reader! Gorgeous.
B00004UFTU|5.0|Brilliant debut album of progressive rock.  Fish delivers cutting lyrics with variations in tone and intensity that accentuate their meaning.  The band plays punchy supporting riffs that makes the album (on vinyl at least) a true test of your sound system.  Loved the album since it was released, Fugazi is as good, Misplaced Child hood more mainstream.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|best  movie I have seen in a really long time.  Not your typical fantasy/ adventure/ action movie.  A movie for the whole family.  It can be appreciated by all ages.  It can be watched over and over, and each time you will get something new out of it.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|BOTTOM LINE:    There are two songs on here I cared NOTHING FOR AT ALL. I think we all know what they are...    other than that I thoroughly enjoy this album.    Compared to his other joints: B  compared to rap music: A+  on its own merit: B+
B00002EPJH|5.0|Keith Jarrett cannot be bested.  This cd is a constant companion in beauty, soul and sound.
031236198X|5.0|Kotter did a fantastic job translating his proven change management process into a format that leaders can understand and use.  Through his powerful fable, Kotter tells the story about the phases of leading change and helps us anticipate the roadblocks along the journey.  Very well done.  Love the useful tools and tips on the website that support it as well...ouricebergismelting.com
B000VS6PD2|5.0|This album is a must have if you're a Daft Punk fan.  Get it!
B000005RRF|5.0|OK, if you have never listened to a single Marillion album in your life, this is how you need to listen to this one. First, unplug the phone and disable the doorbell. Then close every doors and every windows to make sure that no unwelcome outside noise spoils the show. Finally, turn off the lights (make sure the room is in total darkness), pump up the volume (don't use headphones when you listen to this album - it was not meant to be listened to with headphones), kick back, close your eyes and NOW play the album. Got it? Good. When you are done, come back here and tell us that you have just listened to the ultimate Marillion album, that your life is forever changed, that you will have this album in your collection as long as you live and that you too, like all of us fans of Marillion, believe that you were born with the Heart of Lothian.
B0000029GA|5.0|BOTTOM LINE:  Not only one of the best hiphop albums - but one of the BEST albums of any genre!  'Illmatic' is a moment in time when everything in hiphop came together in perfect harmony; beats, production, lyrics, rhythms, musicality, flow, clarity, and brevity. Not only did a 19-yr old Nas have the hottest beatmakers during hiphop's glory days - but God blessed him with a flawless flow and lyrics that are still unrivaled to this day! In my book, this album is the 'Thriller' of hiphop. ('Memory Lane' is simply mindblowing).    A+. Another Hip-Hop Essential.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|With multiple film festival award wins (and a recent Oscar nod) and produced on a shoestring budget (in just 17 days), ONCE is an independent movie marvel. But this isn't what should draw you to it. The draw should be its quirky humor, its incredible music (nearly 2/3 of the film is entirely music), and its intimate portrayal of two people making music while forming a strong bond of friendship.<br /><br />The main actor and actress aren't even given names; there's no reason to as this Guy (played by guitarist extraordinaire Glen Hansard) and Girl (pianist Marketa Irglova) could be anyone off the street. Anyone with an incredible gift for music, that is. Both Guy and Girl work differing jobs than their hearts desire, Guy as a Hoover vacuum cleaner repairman and Girl as a house cleaner. But both have aspirations toward music, Guy more than Girl ...initially. Guy, on his off-time from the Hoover shop, panhandles on a street corner, belting out known songs during the day and his own at night (when no one's around). Girl discovers him and asks him why he doesn't play his own music during the day, and thus starts a series of events that speed this short film to a satisfying conclusion. I say \\"speed\\" in the sense of how short and sweet the film is, not because it is an action or speedy-type film in any way, shape, or form. In fact, if you were going to ding the film for anything, it would be its pacing. Sometimes achingly slow, the story nearly stalls at several points, but thankfully never falters completely.<br /><br />The music is what makes Once what it is, and rightfully so. This is a story about musical wishes and dreams, and how those dreams should never be let go of no matter what the circumstances. Sometimes it takes a wallop upside the head to get you back to your dreams, and Girl is exactly the smack Guy needed in order to accomplish his. Her enjoyment of his songs and her persistent requests to hear more and more from him drive Guy to higher and higher levels. Although much of Guys' songs are based around a former relationship gone sour, it is Girl that opens his eyes to the fact that he still loves his girlfriend and his music ...and this awakening is all thanks to a platonic relationship with a stunningly pretty Czech (Girl).<br /><br />Although Girl gives Guy what he needs, he too gives her something in return. Both come to understand how important their friendship is and what it will eventually mean to them, even should their dreams fail. Chasing after them no matter what the cost becomes all too evident as the film winds to a close.<br /><br />You can't comment on Once without noting its camera work, too. It is very amateurish, almost as if someone were filming an episode of Wayne's World (in Wayne's basement). But it is the amateurish nature that binds the audience to the characters. You feel like you are the camera, peeking at these peoples' intimate lives from behind this corner or through that window.<br /><br />And the music; it's impressive in the extreme, so much so it got nominated for Best Achievement in Music via the Oscars this year (2008), something of a shock for such a low budget film (much smaller than any previous nominee). Glen Hansard has \\"the voice\\" and his co-actress, Marketa Iglova, is no slouch either. Both are musical talents that can make you laugh one minute and nearly bring you to tears the next. And since over 60% of the film is music, that's a very good thing. In fact, for Once, it's the only thing.f Guys' songs are based around a former relationship gone sour, it is Girl that opens his eyes to the fact that he still loves his girlfriend and his music ...and this awakening is all thanks to a platonic relationship with a stunningly pretty Czech (Girl).

B00004Y6NT|5.0|I am a huge fan of Mark Knopfler, but even so I was not expecting this Dire Straits album to be this good.  Communique combines the best of both worlds, with it combo of soulful blues and esoteric Knopfler riffs and lyrics.  Just a pleasure to listen to.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|I've seen Stardust,its a excellent movie.I just want everyone to  get a chance to watch this movie.Its really excellent.
B000001F86|5.0|Rush is now on the uprising of their goodness and talent.  2112 was incredible, but what next?  Of course they break the boundaries with a mix of good classic sounds and hard rock, A Farewell to Kings is a stirring album, and frankly one of my all time favorite albums.  Lifeson on Guitar, Lee on Bass, and of course the acclaimed Peart on Drums.  A Farewell to Kings is a blend of hard rock and epic sounding power, such as the beautiful remedy of \\"Xanadu\\".  With one of their best singles on the album \\"Closer to the Heart\\"  is a good rendition of awesome guitar while songs like \\"Xanadu\\" and \\"Cinderella Man\\" and all the other songs on the album shine through with Peart's legendary style this album weaves one of the best renditions of songs anyone could make.  Though there are only six songs on the album, all of them make it worth the money and they are Rush's masterpieces.  This is my favorite album, I put it even above Moving Pictures, Permanent Waves, and 2112 though those are incredible albums as well!  5/5 to the best Rush album that is flawless in their style.  If you want talent in all three instruments check these guys out, powerful drumming, tight bass guitar, and unique cord structure from the guitar you won't be disappointed.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|BOTTOM LINE:    It's based off of a classic graphic novel (comic book) and NAILS IT PERFECTLY! Mickey Rourke - SWEEEEEET!    If only all movies were done with such attention and care...
0439813786|5.0|This book is a creative, engaging story that uses tons of full-page illustrations to make the story come alive--almost like watching a movie at times.  My 9-year-old son used to read avidly, but lately prefers to ride his bike or skateboard or hang out with friends.  This book absolutely captivated him.  It has the same magic power as, say, Captain Underpants, to make a book absorbing, but you don't feel like you're feeding your child intellectual Cheetos!  (Although that's okay, too, sometimes.)  A great, historically rooted narrative that unfolds like a mystery and keeps kids turning the pages.  (And there are a LOT of pages, but it's actually a pretty quick read, so kids feel proud of tackling a big, thick book.)
0449000729|4.0|Pete Hamill once again paints a nostalgic picture of his New York in the early 1930's.  Specifically, the lower east side.  A fun read.    This time around a love story.
1582701709|5.0|I received The Secret as a gift. The book provides great food for thought/inspiration. The author talks about the power of the Universe. She provides examples of the power of positive thinking and practical applications to everyday life events. Great read.
B000TXZVGQ|4.0|Watching MSCL brought me back to high school all over again...what with resenting my mom, having a crush on the cool, bad boy....as you get older, experience more relationships, you become more jaded about love, things are just less intense. you experience that one relationship that cut you the deepest and vow never to love that way again. watching this dvd brought back memories of innocence and youth. it's a shame that it ended after the first season. many of the issues in the show are still current today: alcohol/drug abuse, sexual confusion, problems in marriage....all this aside, how HOT is jared leto?!?!!  =)
B000UFAURI|5.0|Multi-layered, melodic, hard driving rock. This one has it all. More of what you've come to expect from Dave and the boys. Great video for The Pretender too.
1905236042|4.0|What I like most about these is that they are color coded for different kinds of poses and activities.  I like the flexibility of mixing up the poses or focusing on one kind, rather than using a book that sets the sequence.  The only thing I don't like about this and some other kids yoga products is that the names of poses are changed to make them more kid friendly.  Since there's no consistency between products, one will call child's pose, for example, \\"sleeping mouse,\\" and another will call it \\"rock.\\"  But overall, I highly recommend these cards.
6304712944|5.0|First saw this movie in December, 1967.  Couldn't believe that a didn't have a copy in my home library.  It defines my youth to me.
B000M341QE|5.0|One of those movies you can watch over and over, like Pulp Fiction.  Even though Jack N has become a parody of himself, he is decent.  Damon is money in the bank.  If he's in the movie, see the movie.  DiCaprio gets better with every role.  This isn't even Scorsese's masterpiece which lets you know how strong his resume is, but it was worthy of his academy award.
0316067598|5.0|This is a gripping recount of how an actual mission went terribly bad. I couldn't stop reading once I started. This book takes you on an emotional heart-wrenching journey.
0141439475|5.0|As far as I have gotten in the book it is a good piece of Literature. I am reading it for a Literature Course in School.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|I loved this movie for reasons that sometimes had little to do with the film.  I grew up on the Beatles (and the Stones, of course), in New York, worried about the Draft, protesting Vietnam, shocking total strangers by long hair and wild clothes, etc. and so it felt like a lost, overlong letter from a good friend who's a bit tired while writing and rambles on: stirring, intimate, but sometimes dull.  There are scenes of wonderful, wild inventiveness, and there are also scenes that are sadly literal and prosaic, and one that is a horrendous dud: Eddie Izzard singing \\"Mr. Kite\\" as if determined to trash the song.  Except for him,  the voices are all good and touching, especially that of \\"Sadie\\" who's a Janis Joplin figure, and the lead, who sounds eerily like Ewan McGregor in Moulin Rouge.  That comparison undercuts the movie's strengths because Julie Taymor never matches the anarchic, sensual brilliance and excitement of Moulin Rouge, where the songs burst forth from the drama. Here, you feel at times as if the songs are being plugged in mechanically to a not very inventive script.  Even the movie version of Hair had more oomph.  And yet, there's such blissful sweetness at times in Across the Universe that I felt very forgiving, and I'm still musing about the lovely gentle, transcendent treatment of \\"Dear Prudence.\\"  That almost makes up for the flat, unexciting finale which feels like the writers ran out of juice, and the often thin, uninspiring arrangements of the songs.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I have been listening to this recrord for 2 years now and i'm still  blown away. It is a timeless classic. Best production by far for a Tool Record and the songs are killer. Dont hesitate to buy this if you havnt allready. BTW the album packaging is worth the $ alone. It makes it worth it that this album is not available on itunes. YOu will see why when you purchase it. I am on my third copy of this album because i keep giving it to my friends. i will keep buying it untill i am broke.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|It's a Blade Runner junkie's wet dream.  The picture and sound don't get better than what you'll see here in high def, on either HD DVD or Blu-ray. The packed in extras are great items to add to a Blade Runner collection but don't rush out to buy this if you're not an über-Blade Runner fan.  If you love the movie but it doesn't make your top five films of all time list then you are better off with one of the cheaper packages available.  If you want to show off what Blu-ray and high definition have to offer than this is sure to impress.
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|I got this throttle for my birthday.  I had it on my wishlist for a long time but could not convince myself to buy it.  Well, now I'm glad I have it, actually, it's made the simulation so much more realistic.  Spinning out of a parking spot with one engine, practicing single engine flying, and just alone the feel of having a somewhat realistic throttle in your hand adds a lot of realism.  The fact that the leverage is very long also give you more precision when changing power settings.    The only problems I ran into are the setup.  Saitek for some reason uses an auto calibration as soon as the joystick/throttle is deteceted when plugged in.  After that, there is no calibrating via software manually.  When you go to the Saitek forums, the majority of the problems are revolving about this auto-calibration issue.  You would think Saitek would learn.  Either way, the fix is quick, all you need to do is to delete the auto calibration entry from the registry, and it will re-calibrate again, usually this second time it does it perfectly.  If you need more info, go to the Saitek website and their forums, you will find all the information there.  I also had to change the sensitivity and null zone settings in Flight Simulator 9, I recommend reading about this in the forums also, but I would say within 30 minutes I was flying and never looked back.    The quality of the joystick is quite good.  It's made out of plastic but seems very sturdy.  There are two ways to mount it to a surface, and I like that flexibility.    Overall I highly recommend this throttle.  I do wish it had four levers, not three, although I do fly mostly twin engine jets, so that works well for me.  The left lever is my speedbrake, the middle and right one are the two throttles.  I programmed the speedbrake to \\"auto-arm\\" when pushed below the detent, and the throttles are programmed to go into thrust reverse when pushed beyond the detent.    Edit:  I have had this throttle quadrant for about a year and ahalf now.  I had to re-calibrate it a few times.  Turns out it's the actual throttle sensors going bad though.  The throttles jump and skip and are unusable for flying and no calibrating helps any more.  It's a shame, I really enjoyed it while it worked.  I think I will go back and get a CH throttle, their equipment has always lasted forever.  I would rate this throttle lower now due to the durability issue.

B00000099Y|5.0|I love this band and when i first heard this record a few years ago i diddnt get it. Dumb me, anyway after getting 10,000 days and getting my head split open by it i went back to see what the deal was. The deal was that this record is amazing. The packaging is genius as well. I am such a fan of the way this band takes so much time to make every aspect of all their products so top notch. It will stand the test of time and move people for centuries. Forever a fan please forgive me for not getting it the first time i heard it. Some of the best things in life take effort to see the whole picture and Tool makes pictures that you can look at forever.
0143038419|5.0|READ THIS BOOK!!!  Truly a wonderful book for any woman who questions her life and the direction it has taken.  Liz is a master story teller and doesn't hold back the truth.  She is an inspiration to me and countless others.  I can't wait to travel to Italy and eat for enjoyment.  Thank you for such a candid view in your life, Liz.  You are amazing!
B000RZIGVS|4.0|The disks are well organized and the picture is very clean when watching. But for the price, I expected more from the packaging.
B000BAQ8A0|5.0|I didn't understand the opera until I saw this version. Rossini's original title was \\"Almaviva, or The Useless Precaution.\\" With \\"Cessa di piu resistere\\" restored to the score, it's suddenly clear that Rossinni's \\"Il Barbiere\\" was always intended to be more focused on Almaviva/Lindoro than anyone else. It isn't about Figaro; yes, he does have the famous aria, \\"Largo al factotum\\" in this opera, but the story is about Almaviva and Rosina.    I enjoyed this performance from the moment early morning workers wheeled sculpted white buildings onto the stage during the overture. I think Flórez' performance of \\"Cessa\\" here is even better than on his \\"Rossini Arias\\" musical CD. From beginning to end, he is a master of every bit of this role. If it weren't for the difference in time, you might think Rossini had written it for him.     I was delighted to see Ruggero Raimondi as Basilio. His role here is smaller here than when he rendered what has been, for me, a definitive performance of Escamillo. Despite that, he has put no less care into the singing or characterization of the old charlatan who changes sides in the middle of a plot.    Maria Bayo delivers a lovely performance as Rosina. Her voice is sweet, pure and strong, and her characterization is precisely what Rosina's should be: youthful, agile, a bit reckless, resourceful and loving.    My history with this opera has been interesting. I started with Maria Callas' recording, and listened to it happily for years. Later on, I acquired the Black Dog Opera Library (hardback librettos) version, which features Beverly Sills as Rosina, and I discovered that the Callas recording had left off the delightful finale, \\"Di si felice innesto\\" which Sills ornaments with lovely over the top trills in its closing choruses.    I had never heard of Almaviva's final aria \\"Cessa di piu resistere\\" until I was doing some research for a project of my own. Once I knew I was missing it, I wanted to hear it. I got my wish when Flórez recorded an album of Rossini Arias. I bought it and loved it.    When this DVD came out, I knew I had to buy it, and I'm glad I did. Whether Rossini chose to shift the focus from Figaro to Almaviva as a way of making it clear that he did not intend to insult Paisello or because he was writing to show off the voice of the tenor who would sing Almaviva is unimportant. What is important is that Rossini's is the definitive Il Barbiere, and if you want to hear Almaviva sung as Rossini must have imagined, you need to get this version.    Besides the need to hear Flórez, this DVD is a must have for opera lovers because every member of this cast acts. (As we know, that cannot be said of every singer, or even of every singer who is recorded on DVD. It's true that they're acting for the stage, but this is a stage production, so they should be acting for the stage. For us, since it's a broad comedy, the broad gestures used for the stage aren't distracting.)  A side note: It is a pity that those who decided to film the performance didn't think the makeup through. No, the audience in the theater wouldn't notice that the script calls for Bayo to be younger than her actual years, but the film audience will. It's even sadder because she's slender and agile. (She climbs up on a pedestal to sing \\"Un voce poco fa.\\") It would not have been hard to choose a more becoming hairstyle and makeup for her and a more mature style for Flórez. Yes, it's harder to add ten or fifteen years to the age of someone in his or her thirties, but it would not have been too hard for a single performance. Don't hesitate to buy the DVD for that reason, though. It's a great show!    On the whole, I'm thrilled with the disc, and would recommend it highly, whether as a first introduction to \\"Il Barbiere,\\" to Rossini, or to opera.
0316067598|5.0|This book changed my life in a minute...well, the 8 hours or so it took me to read it. Luttrell is now on my list of BAMFs. I Love how the story is told exactly as I can see a special operator thinking, and I completely agree that his assessment of the government handcuffing us for doing our jobs is absolutely ludicrous. I remember watching live as Lt. Murphy's parents were awarded his posthumous Medal of Honor and feeling changed. I didn't know Mikey and Im not a SEAL, but eating the same mud as the men featured in this book is an honor to me. A absolute pleasure to read and an unrelenting page turner, this book is now one of my favorites along with the Ranger Handbook and The Count of Monte Cristo! Semper Fi Marcus, well done!
B000WMEAKC|5.0|Every single song on this album is fabulous.  I love it.  We are going to see them in concert in a couple weeks and I can only imagine how incredible it will be.  I highly recommend this cd!!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This season will make you sit at the edge of your seat.  You'll be confused, but in a good way.  It will make you excited for Season 4, which is playing now.
B000EHQ57Q|2.0|I've read all the reviews here on QOB and am amazed that no one has mentioned what truly destroys this album. DISTORTION! I'm a pro recording engineer and have always been aware this moodies album suffers terribly! The Master crossfaded tape is horribly distorted. It also seems down a tape generation. Most engineers just splice the crossfades 'tween tracks into the master takes to avoid degradation of the body of the song... but I'm not convinced that road was taken by evidance in the dull muddy overall sound. The song 'The Balance' is absolutely destroyed with distortion!  If you listen to the bonus tracks on this sacd release (non-crossfaded full versions) you will here a major improvment in fidelity and NO DISTORTION! The bass is clean and round and all things are musch more well defined. If they cared about this record they would re-assemble it using these pre crossfaded versions and do the crossfades digitally..It needs to be rescued!!!!I've bought this album way too many times to be cheated like this again! Now that I know the clarity is there but they won't make it right! I'm disappointed and even pissed that they keep serving this fine wine in a old dirty plastic cup! Why don't they care???
080701429X|5.0|A Nazi camp survivor, Frankl should know about searching for meaning.  First part contains his account of time in the concentration camps.  Second part serves as an introduction to logotherapy, imparting a sense of hope in psychotherapy patients by helping them find the meaning in their life or hardship.  Frankl states that meaning is an innate need for all people, not just a reaction formation or ego issue. It makes sense to me, and as a survivor, Frankl has the \\"credentials\\" to back it up!
B000KJT8IG|4.0|I have been pricing the regular dvd but have seen it for no cheaper than 15.99. With this only 4 dollars more it was an easy choice. Some inside scenes and blacks are grainy but that can be expected with the age of the film. But overall it is a good blu-ray and great if you love the movie as much as I do.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|When i first saw the trailer i was like ok i aint going to see this one it's gonna suck and i ended up buying it and i have to say i love it totally, my favorite is still the second one but there's something about this one, it brings the story to another level and i hope they will make a follow up cuz it can't end up that way an army of Alice hell yeah bring it on. So awesome movie, great cast and go see it haha !!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I love that this version reflects more on the relationship between Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot
0767817664|5.0|I seen this movie when it first came out in 1985. It is an 80's suburban vampire movie. Pretty hip compared to the 60's and 70's vampire movies.Not too many dull moments. I compare this to the Lost Boys which came out  in 87.One of the top 5 vampire movies of all time (Lost boys is still #1 with me).<br />  This film will hold a special place in your heart if you live in the suburbs- you can relate to.<br />You will definately want to add this to your horror collection and good to watch every October. Still brings back fond memories from 1985.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|This is not the best album I heard about Radiohead but Yorke and family have their own style, it's strengthened.
B000OZ28IS|4.0|I bought it thinking it was a mystery but the writer doesn't develop a suspensful story for most of the book. I would describe it as an interesting \\"tale of a spy\\" prior to the US entering World War Two.
B000056NX5|4.0|Visually and musically stunning, this stage-acted production of JCS seems less a re-imagination than a refitting of the original in contemporary high fashion and music video.<br /><br />Comparing this production to the 1973 movie is, in some ways, like comparing apples to oranges: The acting in a stage production will always differ substantially from the same roles acted in a movie, the former being inherently melodramatic to reach a theater audience, and the latter being subdued for the cameras (and refined through multiple retakes of a scene).<br /><br />Adorned in pricey attire, beautifully lit, buff and moisturized, the cast of this JCS is reminiscent of Details Magazine or Abercrombie ads: Uniformly attractive and, due to their spotless appearance, artificial. Many fans of the original JCS (including me) may find this Madison Avenue version of modernity unrealistic and contrary to the poverty and rugged living conditions of Jesus' times as well as the present-day Middle East. But the intent of this production was to make JCS ultra-contemporary for a post-MTV generation. Thanks to minimalist set design and excellent photography, the ultra-contemporary concept is well-executed.<br /><br />The script, songs and timing of the new JCS closely follow the original with little noticeable variation. And like the original production, this one lacks rootedness in the Jewish faith of Jesus and his followers -- but then, so do most productions about Jesus.<br /><br />One big break with the 1973 movie is in setting: The original movie was set in gritty, desolate Holy Land locations. The new movie is set in a clean, expensive-looking, post-modern urban plaza that lacks historical context.<br /><br />Another break: Jerome Pradon's courageous and vulnerable (if sometimes melodramatic) new take on an insecure and emotionally wounded Judas.<br /><br />Glenn Carter is satisfactory as Jesus, especially at crucifixion, though at times his performance (like his fellow cast members) is too smooth, glamorous, and \\"theatrical\\" for such emotionally and physically traumatic circumstances.<br /><br />Like its predecessors, this production forfeited the opportunity to connect JCS to historical or present-day politics of religious hypocrisy and occupation -- forces that prompted the crucifixion. Jesus' persecutors are instead portrayed as fictitious Goth fascist egotists with no plausible real-world equivalent.<br /><br />I give this movie three-and-a-half stars for its dazzling production values, music, casting, and execution of a concept: Jesus of Nazareth meets contemporary fashion and personal expression.<br /><br />I subtract a star-and-a-half for overemphasis on fashion, absence of religious and political context, and performances that try a little TOO hard (at times) to be theatrical.r such emotionally and physically traumatic circumstances.

B00003CX8V|5.0|I haven't seen this but someone speacial to me wanted it and has very good taste in movies so I am assuming it is good.
0938045695|5.0|This is a great book. I would say it's a must have for anyone that wants to start working out with kettlebells.
