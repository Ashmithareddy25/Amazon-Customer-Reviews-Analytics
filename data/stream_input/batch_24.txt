B00062PN6I|5|Perfect head phone for the price!!
B00CATSONE|4|Nice book.
B00RVBY8KO|5|Very inciteful view of growing up. What shapes a person is so well laid out in this boys childhood. Excellent acting all around.
B007SGLZP8|5|Grisham never fails to entertain his readers. This novel is a bit more convoluted and keeps the reader guessing.
B0097HSS4M|1|Every time i try to open it , it crashes. Got it for free but not worth.deleted forever.
B00J6YA1V4|5|As. described and on time
B000JMKQX0|5|It is a peculiar but a great book. I would recommend to everyone who wants the experience of their life
B008602KQI|1|The story line is horribly conceived. It is not written very well at all. The main character is very unhappy and not very comforting soul.
B004LOMB2Q|4|I have been using evernote for years now. I have a vast amount of notes from college, old family recipes, and list of things I need to get.
B007IXWL2C|5|It might not have been well-written, but it was definitely entertaining.  I will be reading and re-reading...and re-reading...and...well you get my point :-)
B008COII1Y|1|I like Zombie movies as much as the next person but this was painfully slooow. There is minimal to none in the zombie killing and Zombie attacks. The only thing good was the picture on the box.
1416972242|3|I was not very satisfied by this volume of the Mortal Instruments series. I think it was summed up well by a friend of mine as just being a very weird book. The writing is unnecessarily melodramatic while the plot moves along quite slowly, except during the important parts, where it seems to zoom by too fast. For the most part, the characters are kept realistic, although they all do go through their brief moments of flatness. The cultural references are a fun addition, adding a bit of extra enjoyment throughout the book. Like I had said in my review of City of Bones, the love triangle is overdone, like so many other books. The additional drama with Simon's character seems ridiculously overdone to me, particularly the supposed vampire vs. werewolf drama, as if we needed more of that. The cliffhanger was crazy awesome, and I can't wait to read more, but by God, I hope we are done with the disgustingness that is Jace/Clary. I don't need to read about siblings who are madly in love with each other, I really don't. Anyways, looking forward to getting my hands on City of Glass, and, oh, one last thing. Dumbledore would so win in a fight versus Magnus, no questions asked!<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/5
B002XTBE6K|5|My boys and I bought this dvd for my wife's birthday.  She absolutely loves the story line, the set colors,  and the music.  We have several versions of the classic story but   she enjoys this one the most.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|fun because any one can play no matter the age. you could be two or too old if there is such a thing
B002PZ6XB8|5|I was really amazed at how interesting and enjoyable this movie turned out.  Just wish 'they' had selected an English actress to play  the role of Miss Potter.  Renee Zellweger is a fine actress, but the same goes with the Bridget Jones movies, she just is not British and to me it takes something away from the film.
B00T73ATFW|5|Absolutely amazed! Can't stop listening!
B000UOOT1W|5|super!
B00FAX6XQC|1|sucks hunts don't work wont load.  took all my gold at random.  ALL my other games and apps work fine on nh kindle except this one.  I contacted glue 2weeks ago about the problem and have had zero response.  the app sucks and so does the support
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good game, although the pix, which are beautiful, often seem small even when enlarged on my tablet. Not for those with poor eyesight! The music is nice, unlike in some games. I like how the pix are designed, with objects sometimes smaller or bigger and not always in the same place. The main story is interesting. I wish there was a &#34;rules&#34; rubric to explain certain things, like the anomalies. Overall, 4/5 stars.
B007QA3AH2|5|This movie is Fun and Funny. If only Bill Shatner's real life was this exciting. Makes me wanna go to comic con
B00005AACC|4|This is an action film and the main interest is the action itself. The point is that it is well built, entertaining and extremely credible which makes the action all the more acceptable. The acting is also extremely good with a brilliant Tom Cruise. But the film has some depth, some real depth. We are speaking here of terrorism, but the type that comes from global criminals. They are white, European or American, and they only aim at making a lot of money by forcing some not-too-ethical businessmen spit out much money under the pressure of some blackmail, though this blackmail leads these businessmen to making even more money than they are forced to spit out. A « gentleman's agreement » in a way. This type of crime, of terrorism is common and frequent, but most of the time unknown and even well hidden. The topic of the film is even more uptodate than we may imagine. A pharmaceutical firm invents a killing germ and the drug that can stop it. The objective is quite obviously to release the germ into the public in order to sell the drug. But a criminal gets his hands on both the germ and the drug and then can blackmail the businessman. This denunciation of pharmaceutical firms is not unique and it plays on the fear among the public that some new disease should appear and kill millions of people. We know about AIDS. We know about the SRAS. We know about Mad Cow disease. But do we know everything ? That is particularly frightening, though the film tries to reassure us by showing some people who fight against this, even to the death if necessary. A disquieting film anyway.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B00CFA222M|5|An already great fairy tale updated for a new generation of viewers. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B000053VAZ|5|I love this feel-good movie! It's a special treat to watch Sam, Johnny Depp's quirky, sweet and child-like character, who makes grilled cheese sandwiches with an iron and entertains at a park with his impressive Buster Keaton-like routines. He looks and acts like someone who walked in from another era, maybe even another planet. Watch Depp's facial expressions -- intense and hilarious! <br />There are heavy moments, such as the bus scene: When the romance between Sam and Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) is misunderstood, forcing the pair to run away, Sam comes face to face with the reality of mental illness as Joon becomes severely agitated with the voices in her head. But he never gives up on love, finding a way to get to Joon at the mental hospital by dangling acrobatically just outside her room from a window washer's perch (my favorite scene). And yes, there's a happy ending. <br />I watched this movie with my husband and our children (ages 10 and 12). If you plan to watch Benny &amp; Joon with kids, be aware that bad words are used a couple of times, and there's a romantic scene between Sam and Joon that's slightly steamy but not distasteful. Overall, though, the touching story, dialogue, and humor make this a fine movie to watch with kids over 9 years of age (younger kids would probably find it boring). <br />Creative story with fun characters! Some of the almost surreal scenes will replay in your mind to make you smile and even laugh out loud.
1592401791|2|Emerick was the Beatles recording engineer 40 or so years ago and has decided to write a book on his experiences with them in the studio.  Thus, he can now be considered the 612th 5th Beatle.  He pretty much portrays Ringo as a shmuck who can't sing and who barely could play drums without Paul to hold his hand.  His opinion of George isn't much better, dissing his guitar playing as well as his somber personality.  Lennon is portrayed as a talented flake, but overrated in his impact on the group.  Paul is Geoff's boy, the true leader of the group, the one who gets things done.  I'm always skeptical of someone who waits until after the death of his subject (or one of them) to write about them.  Harrison and Lennon are not around to refute any of what our hero, the previously unknown Geoff, tells us.  I'd be curious to hear Ringo's opinion of the portrayal.  No doubt that Paul has no problems with the book since it is so sycophantic towards him.  Why did it take 40 years to write this book and how is the author able to remember, verbatim, thoughts that he had back than as a 19 year old?      The funniest aspect of the book is the author's delusional sense of equality of importance with the band.  He derides Lennon's technical proficiency, stating something to the effect:  \\"The musician is focused on the music, which is as it should be.  The sound engineer is focused on the sound, which is as it should be.\\"  The way he presents it is with equality of importance to the overall result.  Imagine an equipment manager on a football team writing a book on his experiences:  \\"Peyton Manning was focused on the quarterback position, which is as it should be, he had little understanding of how to properly pack up shoulder pads.  I on the other hand was focused on the gear, not understanding the various nuances of the quarterback position.  Together, somehow we made it work\\".
B00I38JJ2Q|5|&#34;The Life and Times&#34; is some pretty good music.  It presents a thrilling soundtrack-like series of songs set to the theme of Scrooge McDuck.  The music itself is outstanding, so don't need to be familiar with the comic to enjoy it.  Tuomas Holopainen (the composer) has done it again and made a fantastic journey out of an album of music.  Nightwish fans should enjoy this as well, only be prepared for beautiful orchestral music, not symphonic metal.
B006IDG2T6|5|This book was a real eye opener for me. It has helped me to understand why I do the things I do and why I make the choices I make. For me, taking Free Will out of the equation is actually liberating, if that make any sense.
B00005OWEG|4|This film is the darker side to Francis Ford Coppola and it won him a armload of Oscars for this winning Masterpiece about the Vietnam war. Now with the redux, I think it shows more of a light side than the original. Some of the deleted footage is okay, but for the most part its a bunch of propaganda for Coppola. However I give ***** for the original which is just eerie as hell. The story follows a platoon of men to go to Cambodia to asassignate a renegade Coronel, (Marlon Brando). The story was basically just said, but as for the picture, words cannot give Francis Ford Coppola the credit he is due for this dark eerie tale. The special effects were more than 'superb' for its time and still today. From the mentally scarring images to the Oscar worthy performances, Coppola does a superb job in making this, (even though he almost went insane to try to make everything perfect) and out of insanity comes Apocalypse Now. The cast includes: Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Harrison Ford, Lawrence Fishbourne, and Dennis Hopper. If you're addicted to war films like me, then you should love this. (But dont get the Redux, its a waste of money). One of the best Vietnam war movies out and its almost 30 years old! The DVD transfer is superb as well as the art on the disc and DVD. Im not much on films with Martin Sheen, but he will blow your mind away! His performance is that good. One last thing to remember after watching this, \\"The Horrors...The Horrors\\".
B00000JTB2|5|Quick delivery, I like.
B008GJV2OA|5|This movie is a classic. Despite being primarily about the cold war, it does not seem dated. Peter Seller's performances were brilliant, as was George C. Scott's. The whole family enjoyed the movie, even my teenage sons.
B004DMIIOG|5|I was blown away. What can I say. If you love your family, in love,or want to fall in love, this is for you. It is absolutely one of the best anime movies I have had the privilege to view. It is funny, intense, and romantic. I fell in love with this family from the start. The animation is flawless and the Characters are unique to say the least. If you are an avatar fan, computer geek, or love anime in general, you will love this movie. You will not be sorry. All I can say is; it will make you laugh, cry, fall in love with happy endings. Enjoy!
B007FEZQF8|4|I found it a great story mainly because it focuses on human interaction. You almost consider living deads as part of the scenery. Best part of the plot is its focus on how we respond to extreme situations were we face struggle for survival on a daily basis. I am looking forward to reading next book.
B00CWY76CC|4|Good game.It really makes you think about where to go to find your next clue. There are also red herrings thrown in to confuse you.

B006Y9BVRM|5|I ordered my new Seiko Men's Solar Diver Chronograph Watch on 01/06, it was shipped the next day 02/06, and it arrive 4 days before the earliest estimated delivery date. The watch was fully packaged in showroom condition with all relevant documentation including user guide and warranty. The International Warranty Card was completed by the seller. The watch was identical to the watch I looked at in a store, but at a fraction of the store cost. The watch has exceptional features which I am very pleased with, e.g. solar powered, light weight, easy to read, screw crowns for safety, easy to use chronograph functions. I am very impressed with my purchase from this seller and will defiantly purchase future watches from them. I would also have no hesitations recommending them for their service, product and price.

B00EJXX17S|2|Generally good music, and she definitely has good technique.  Her intonation, however, makes me cringe at times.  If you are a stickler for someone actually playing in tune, you may not want to buy this disc.
0812983459|2|I was very disappointed in this book after seeing the high ratings by other readers.  It felt as slow to me as the walk itself.  There were some interesting observations, but overall I don't think the intention of the book was carried out very well.
B007EC27QM|4|Even if you only occasionally use your calculator, this is a worthwhile app to acquire. I particularly like the square root function!

B00CF34B2I|1|I couldn't get the app to download on to my kindle fire hd.
0385732554|5|Must read!  This will always be a favorite book in our home.  Lowry marries the Brave New World with a children's book so that younger readers can enjoy and understand, without some of the topics that are not appropriate for younger readers found in Brave New World.  The story may be disturbing to sensitive young readers so I would recommend parents research the topics covered briefly (or read it yourself) before handing it over to the kids.  However, I believe that it is a fantastic book that should be read by everyone; especially, if you understand the underlying points for books such as Brave New World, 1984, Animal Farm, and the like.
B0000019PA|5|In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is the definitive indie album. It is simply incredible. It is not, however, for anyone who isn't willing to invest him or herself just a little. <br /> <br />Every indie music fan who has heard this album lists it as one of the best. It has it all: Deeply introspective and interpretable and even slightly confusing lyrics. Lo-Fi recording that opens up, intensifying and building on simple sounds instead of using production tricks for easy emotional payoffs. Hum-along melodies so engrossing that you don't even mind if the songs are stuck in your head for weeks. In short, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is both striking and beautiful, and should be considered by anyone who expects more from music. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, some of the defining qualities of the album keep casual listeners away, such as the production and vocals. What some see as honesty, others see as poorly recorded and executed. The only thing I'd say to anyone who doesn't initially see the beauty in this album is that it is totally worth the investment. <br /> <br />
0143038419|5|I loved this book by Elizabeth Gilbert.  It was sweet, funny, and seemed honest.  I was even a little sad when I finished it.  I read a lot, and can't remember the last time I recommended a book to anyone, but I've recommended this one to friends.
B00400NHRO|5|Excellent book, still applies to medicine today
B003VANOFY|5|This g930 has worked wonderfully from my first time using it, the wireless is great and the surround sound stero is great
B0071XO8RA|3|Didn't really live up to the hype - seemed a little repetitive after the first part and I really didn't engage with the story. I might need to go read some fluffy bunny stories, I might be a little burnt out on post-apocalypse stories.
B00FVVR2ZO|4|My new favorite app...be careful super addictive!
B00DR0PDNE|5|This was a gift and we love, love, love it.  Extremely easy to use.  Attach and load the software, start the program, and go to YouTube or other online video sites.  We were up and running in less than 10 minutes.
B003XDZLTG|5|Exactly what I expected.  I get compliments.  Wish I could find the same thing in blue.
B00A8MGLAI|3|I bought this based on the wiki entry for the story, but the movie jumps around way more than the original story.  It was very hard to follow, and thus I never really felt for most of the characters.  I thought they did a great job on the gay guy and what ended up happening to him.  The Korean woman I never really bought into, although the revelation of what that society was doing was pretty gruesome.  Also interesting is the final fate of the characters.  Some live, some die, but we never really know which until the end of that sub story.  The nuthouse section had some pretty good comedy to it, but was not very believable.  The bad guy on the boat played his role very well, whereas I couldn't understand why the bad guys on the Big Island were bad guys or why they were attacking the protagonists family.
B00688628M|5|One of the greatest programs ever

B004DLPXAO|5|Its been great,  I read more because its so easy to download them.
B000IJ7Q32|5|This should be required reading for everyone who claims to \\"care\\" about, well, pretty much anything. I don't see how anyone who looks around, and reads the newspaper, can not be afraid about the course humanity is on. But it is a vague fear, wondering about our future, wondering whether the media reports of potential catastrophe are true.    So here we have a very intelligent, very informed writer telling us that he is concerned. There is no fear here. It is remarkably even toned. It deals with facts. Nothing political. But he is concerned. But rather than simply being concerned, he tells us why, what problems it is that concern him. And then he goes and investigates a the problems of a number of different societies. And then he leaves us with just a tinge of hope that maybe catastrophe is not in fact our destiny. Hard to believe, but at the end of the book, I really did kind of maybe believe that my soon to be born son may actually be a part of the solution rather than the problem, if we educate him.    Regardless, I came away feeling informed. I came away with more knowledge than I previously had. I came away with understanding. And a twinge of hope. This is first rate writing, actually worth reading. It's rare I wish I had the opportunity to actually thank the author personality.    Not that you're probably reading here, you're probably gathering information on your next tome meant to inform us of some of the origins of (and possible solutions to) some of the world's problems, but, Thanks to you, Mr. Diamond.
1591840562|5|This is a fun and quick read. Don't be fooled though, Guy answers a lot of questions that don't get covered in any of the other books on entrepreneurship. For example, what is the appropriate percentage of the company to give to those you invite to be on your board of directors? Or how long should my powerpoint pitch be? These are the kinds of no nonsense problems that Guy explains more clearly than anyone else.  <br /> <br />This book won't teach you everything you need to know to be successful, but it will teach you things you need to be successful that you won't find anywhere else. For anyone considering starting a business or a non-profit, there will be many books you have to read, and this should be book number one.
031606792X|5|I am probably one of the older readers of this series of books. I would like to see the series extended. As for Breaking Dawn, it just is the BEST of the series. However, you have to really read all the other three books to appreciate this one. There is nothing boring in this book, not one thing. I cannot believe anyone would find it borning, if they read the three books prior. I almost blew it, when I picked the book up, and read a few pages, getting hooked on the fourth book. Thanks to my Grandson, I was informed no, no, no, not that one. It is the fourth book. LOL I stopped reading and started with the first book, Twilight. I am curious how they can make a movie with all the things that need to be said and shown in a movie to accurately reflect this book.
030758836X|5|This is one of the best books I have ever read, hands down. Gillian Flynn is my new favorite author. There is no way you will be able to put this down once you start reading.
B003XF1XOQ|5|This was a very realistic ending for this series.  After reading all the negative comments I almost didn't read the final story.  Just goes to show that we need to do our own thing and not read everyone else's evaluations. No, this wasn't a Disney ending, and it wouldn't have been very realistic if it was. Overall a very fine science fiction adventure in a land that I'm glad I'm NOT in!
0985557834|5|Exactly as stated, quick shipping. We would recommend this book to other beginners. Very clear pictures and instructions. Good purchase.
B00DURILJ2|1|Horrible script. Unbelievably thin plot. Waste of talent and my time.  Do yourself a favor and pass on this dog.
B00G4Q3KOC|5|loved it
B005VJ8ATS|1|From the looks of it this film IS simple and for emotional simpletons. It looks like your typical trendy 'Lets make a movie that is a emo hipster drama and call it another genere' movie. It's all emotional crap, no science fiction involved hardly, which is funny since the trailer tries to make sci fi fans interested by misrepresenting it. If you're going to call yourself a SCI FI film, at least have some SCI FI in it other than a backdrop. This movie is probably full of emotional crap, and if you want something cerebral about parallel earths, the first season of SLIDERS blows this crap away. Then again, that is actual SCIENCE FICTION as opposed to HIPSTER CRAP.<br /><br />Sci fi is supposed to be about intelligence and and hard science primarily, leave the emo drama crap as a afterthought. IF you don't like it, go read another review, or go watch 'Twilight' which is about the same viewership level probably as this movie, only difference is that 'Twilight' is to 'Vampires' what this melodramatic garbage probably is to 'Sci Fi'.
B006T5GTK0|5|I forgot how good this movie is.  I had read the book years ago and then saw the movie. In its own way, it is a classic.
B00IJJUIMY|4|I've read all of Michael Connelly's books. They're compellingly set in present day Los Angeles with a protagonist who is trying to right the wrongs of the world in one of the worlds biggest cities. A great sense of place and good characters to care about.

B000000OAN|4|Queen's fourth album is probably their best.  It features the classic hits \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"You're My Best Friend\\", plus solid album tracks like \\"Death on Two Legs\\" and \\"Love of My Life\\".  But I don't really care for the epic \\"The Prophet's Song\\" (I may be in the minority there).  Still, this is a very good album overall.  The CD adds useless remixes of \\"I'm in Love With My Car\\" and \\"You're My Best Friend\\", which sound almost identical to the original versions.
B000I9WWHW|5|Beautiful movie!
B00003CXMG|5|I viewed the film today for the first time and oh my I must say that this has to be one of the greatest films of last year and truly one of the best of all time. Cameron Crowe is really a genuis, the writing in this film is just phenomenal. I'm young and I must say I am now in awe of all music that came out of the late 60's early 70's. I plan on getting the soundtrak to this film.<br />On to the film. Patrick Fugit is an incredible actor, he has such heart in this film especially when speaking with Penny Lane about how Russell really cares about her. Then Kate Hudson's performance in this film, can be described in one word; AMAZING! I have not seen such great acting for someone as young as Kate in a long time. You really forget that you are watching Kate Hudson on the screen and you think you are watching Penny Lane, and that is what great acting is all about and very few films and actors have the ability to do that anymore. But Kate can! As well as Patrick Fugit. While I was watching this movie, I didnt like of it as a movie, you completely forget while watching it, because the acting is so top notch. Frances McDormand as William Miller's over protective Mom is so great, I love how Cameron Crowe described her &quot;You could have a whole movie just based on my Mom&quot; And really you can. Frances gives one of the best performances of the movie, behind Kate and Patrick, who just hold the whole movie together. Patrick is the innocense and Kate is the heart. If Kate Hudson is not awarded the Best Supporting Actress Oscar this year, I have lost all hope in HollyWood!<br />Billy Crudup who plays rock star Russell is also great, but he has this stigma about him, that just says JERK! Also the fact that he treats Penny Lane like a toy makes you want to hate him even more. Penny is in love with the music, she is there as a fan who is in awe of the music along with her other bandaids. And the fact that Russell and his other bandmates always say it is for the fans, Russell fails to see that Penny is their biggest fan and he treats her as though she is just a peice of trash. But then Russell also has a quality about him, saying please just like me. So I give him credit.<br />The other members are not featured much, but play a prominent role in some scenes.<br />This is really a movie about the love of music, finding your true self and just having a helluva time expeirencing and meeting new people. I encourage everyone to see this film and I promise you that will not regret it. Even if you hate Kate Hudson you will appreciate her just for giving you the pleasure of seeing her perofrmance. Also if there is nothing you find you like about this film, there will always be the music!fails to see that Penny is their biggest fan and he treats her as though she is just a peice of trash.

1400043662|5|Franz Kafka wrote of freeing the \\"tremendous world\\" inside his head and the fear that it would tear him to pieces if he tried to bury it within himself. For young Kafka Tamura, the protagonist in Haruki Murakami's magnificent new novel, KAFKA ON THE SHORE, the tremendous inner world is not literary but must be freed and explored all the same. In fact, for Kafka Tamura, coming to terms with this world is a matter of life and death. <br /> <br />Fifteen-year-old Kafka runs away from home, not sure of his destination, only certain that he must get away from his father. In the back of his mind is the idea that he may find his long lost mother and sister, even if it means fulfilling the strange prophecy his father cursed him with --- that Kafka would kill his father and then sleep with his mother and sister. Kafka leaves Tokyo with the voice of the \\"boy called Crow\\" in his head telling him that he must now be the strongest 15-year-old in the world. When he finally arrives in Takamatsu, he not only finds a strange and peaceful library to spend his time in but also awakens outdoors one night covered in blood with no memory of what has transpired. He soon learns that his father, back in Tokyo, has been brutally murdered, and soon he takes refuge in the library and with the kind librarians. <br /> <br />As Kafka begins his journey, so does Nakata, an elderly man who, after a violent incident when he was a schoolboy, has lost many memories and the ability to read and write --- but he does have the ability to talk to cats. Nakata flees Tokyo after he kills a bizarre madman named Johnnie Walker, who has been murdering cats in order to create an otherworldly flute. Nakata eventually is joined in his travels by Hoshino, a young truck driver who at once guides Nakata and is guided by him. <br /> <br />If this all sounds strange and complicated, it is. But Murakami's story is also profound and beautiful --- full of philosophy, metaphors, symbols and amazing characters. In a whollyunique style, perhaps best described as Japanese magical realism, Murakami's tale is both hopeful and heartbreaking --- a story of grief, loss and memory. <br /> <br />Soon the police are looking for Kafka to answer questions about his father's death, and Oshima, the wise and mysterious librarian, lets Kafka stay and work in the library. There, Kafka falls in love with the sad and grief-stricken Miss Saeki, a woman old enough to be his mother. He learns of her heartbreak and the song she wrote called \\"Kafka on the Shore,\\" which translates to Kafka Tamura. What is the connection between Miss Saeki and Kafka? If she is his mother, and lover, has his father's dark prophecy come true? <br /> <br />Eventually Kafka must leave the library, and he stays for a while in a cabin in a deep and haunted forest where he finally must confront his loss and the hatred he felt for his father. At the same time, Nakata must close a mystical entrance he has opened to restore the world to the way it is supposed to be. <br /> <br />Throughout their journeys (if indeed the journeys are separate and not in fact the same journey), both Nakata and Kafka are helped by various characters, and each must confront painful and confusing realities in order to complete the nameless mission they seem compelled to undertake. <br /> <br />Without the dark paranoia of Franz Kafka's work, Murakami's novel does share some characteristics with it, such as a horrible father/son relationship, a feeling of a secret and closed other world, and a life full of riddles. KAFKA ON THE SHORE also refers to Hegel and other philosophers, the life and work of Beethoven, the story of Oedipus, and Japanese spirituality. <br /> <br />KAFKA ON THE SHORE is brilliant storytelling, such an original and well-written novel. It is fun and interesting to read, but thoughtful and challenging as well. <br /> <br />Franz Kafka wrote that a book \\"must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us,\\" and Kafka Tamura must destroy the frozensea of memory and loss in order to, quite literally, live the rest of his life. Murakami's novel is successful in so many ways (despite some slowness toward the middle section of the book) and surely must be the type of story Kafka had in mind when he imagined books as axes, destroying the cold parts of our hearts and souls to allow in warmth. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman
B00C7TAF3Y|5|I really like the graphics.  It makes you think but not to the point of giving up. Definitely neat puzzles.
B00HV2KPNW|5|love this moving watched it 4 times in one weekend<br />very cute movie for families to watch together.  very entertaining
B001C4CI8U|5|I watched a couple of the shows in the first season and decided it was just a knock-off of X-FILES. I was wrong! I then started watching it in the second season and got completely hooked. I realized I had to see it from the beginning. So..... if you have become \\"FRINGE FANATIC\\" after the first season you really need to get this set. The network doesn't seem to have many reruns and not in order when they do. I watched the dvds twice and then sold the set to another Fringe late bloomer.
0062183613|4|This book offers lots of captivating insights, backed by experimental data, on factors that increase our likelihood of being dishonest. Simple cost-benefit analyses surprisingly are definitely not relevant in the behavior of cheating. Rather, the prevailing social norms, the ability to rationalize, and the presence of an overwhelming amount of temptations, to name a few, are the real determinants on how honestly/dishonestly we act. Our ability to produce narratives that convince ourselves that we are essentially honest, even when we really aren't, is also highly relevant. Suggestions, again with evidence from experimental data, that can improve our honesty are given. The style is relaxed and conversational. Four stars.
B00B2G4O2G|5|Watched the first couple episodes and then the last one of the season 1 was a good story but the end of season one sucked.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Beautifully written and constructed.  Two parallel stories which will obviously come together, but which do so in such an  uncontrived way that it he book is seamless.
B004LWZWGA|5|This is a fantastic end to the trio of Batman movies made by Christopher Nolan, featuring Christian Bale as Batman.  Plenty of love, deceit, and action, the film doesn't fail to entertain.  Based on the Knightfall storyline from the comics, Bane (much improved over the version in Batman & Robin) takes over Gotham, breaking the Batman.  Batman has to fight his way back, redeeming himself and his city.  Featuring a major appearance by Catwoman (Anne Hathaway), the film gives a satisfying conclusion.
B0002F6AH0|5|This is the definitive visual chronicle of World War II, in my opinion. Both audio and video quality are excellent.  This is carefully presented content, and while I may not agree with some of the military tactical analysis, this is nonetheless a superb documentary. The extra features are enjoyable as well.
B005IQZB14|5|Great story, very motivational, makes we want to go hike more of the Pacific Coast Trail.

B004XJRQUQ|4|Chronicle started at a fast, captivating pace with an intriguing storyline but slows towards the ending with a storyline that loses some steam and intrigue.
B0001L3LUE|3|I thought McNamara came across in the this film basically the way I had always thought him to be; a pathetic person with no moral back bone at all. If he indeed had opposed the war in Vietnam I don't understand why he didn't resign, and the answer is that he didn't oppose the war.<br /><br />  Everyone claims McNamara was so bright, but even when he went to Vietnam in 1995 he had to have it explained to him that the Vietnamese were fighting for their independence. Why didn't he know that? I was 25 years old in 1966 and I knew that.<br /><br />  Ho Chi Minh was a young student in Paris at the end of WWI. When President Wilson came to Paris, Minh sent letter to Wilson asking him to help free his country from the French. They wanted their independence. Wilson never replied. Why didn't McNamara know that.<br /><br />  As for McNamara's eleven lessons from his life; no brainers each one. Stuff that one learns the first week in a business education class in high school.<br /><br /> The film added nothing to our knowledge of World War II or the Vietnam War that hasn't been discussed before.<br /><br />  So I came away from the film feeling the McNamara still doesn't know who he is or what he is about....still trapped in the fog of his wars.

I love how clear his book has made a difference in my studying and my everyday life.  I understand now and practice how to be in the \\"Now\\", and it's amazing the peace and the clarity that I get realizing that I don't have to do anything but allow  God to be.  Matt. 6:33 and other scripture have become so profound and clear to me.  Thank you.

193700788X|5|After seeing all the negative reviews I was braced for the worst, but I was blissfully surprised at how good a book this was.  I've been reading the Sookie Stackhouse books for years now, eagerly awaiting each new book.  I think this was the perfect ending to a fantastic series. There's not much wondering what will happen from here and I sleep easy knowing Sookie will be happy.<br />This book is a departure from the previous books and many characters I have grown to love (and sometimes hate) fade into the background, but they are SOOKIE books after all, not Eric or Bill.<br />In the end, if Sookie is happy, then I am happy.  And I am very happy indeed.
B002Y0TGOU|5|Great movie, effects were great action was great overall, in my opinion one of the best Star Trek movies I have seen
B000002GJ7|4|In the late 1980s, something got into the water supply and convinced top forty radio to take on the big issues.  Personally, I can't figure out a pop environment full of toy soldiers pondering another day in paradise - even Axl Rose was compelled to question the civility of war - but that's just the way it was.  Nirvana is often credited with breaking down this sort of preaching, but such mainstream acts as U2 and Genesis had already figured out how to sharpen such things with sarcasm several months before Nevermind hit the shelves.  This is the long ago, far away world that spawned Pornograffitti.    Gary \\"Van Halen III Never Happened\\" Cherone and faithful shredder/backing vox Nuno Bettencourt give away the game with the first killer hook - dance into the decadence! - and stay with it throughout the album.  It's a pretty simple trick, but it put Extreme near the top of their dying genre as far as intelligence goes.  That won't spare you, the listener of 2014, from filing this under \\"guilty pleasures\\" as the whole thing was dated on arrival, but it was enough to get them designated an art-pop outfit.  How ridiculous is Florence Welch going to look in five years...but I digress.    The music has a couple more tricks up its sleeve than the lyrics.  While it's all still mostly verse-chorus-verse, Bettencourt's guitar stunts never lose the melody and sometimes engage in some interesting call-and-response with Cherone.  Several songs play around with surprising arrangements: you're probably familiar with the country-pop of \\"Hole Hearted\\" from two decades of radio play, but there's a lounge number (self-deprecating but not sarcastic) and an ear-wormy bit of white boy funk waiting to be heard again.  Even the infamous \\"More Than Words\\" is a bit of a structural oddity without a real chorus, though its Grammy nomination is beyond human understanding.    There's a loose concept here about a boy named Francis whose worldview comes entirely from television, but it barely holdstogether at all.  One look at the videos and it's hard to buy the \\"satire\\" of an oversexed culture either, though coming from Rihanna's guitarist it's pretty funny in hindsight.  So this is mostly a wash as an artistic statement with some respect for the attempt, but as a collection of riff-heavy pop songs from a bygone era, \\"Pornograffitti\\" more than works.

B00F0AI9Y4|5|Really surprised by how many GREAT songs are on this album.  I actually originally bought this on Google Play because it was on sale, and decided to purchase it again on Amazon to keep all my music in one place (I prefer Amazon's music management over Google's).  Looking forward to Avicii's next album - hopefully it will be just as good as this one.

B000FVQYYK|3|Okay.. I wish I could give them 3 and half stars but I can't. I have all of their released works. I regard the Muse as one of the most original, creative, talented, inspiring bands of my life-time. Their scope and versatility are amazing. I have to say that Black Holes and Revelations is not as good as any of their previous works. Having said that, it is still good, and there are still some great tracks on it. I know that they have always had the odd cover track on their albums, but it is a little worrying that the number seems to be increasing. Whilst their songs that they choose to cover are always superbly done, I feel a bit uncomfortable when the CD does not make clear what is a cover song, and what is original. I think that the boys need to take a break, and re-charge their batteries. Maybe have a few kids, give them a different angle on life. I believe that they are going through a transitional period. I will still buy every future album that they release...
B00GIXY4M8|1|I wanted so badly to like this movie and say that it was great, but I can't. It's not so much of what the movie was, but what it could have been. I never thought I would say this but its time for a wolverine reboot, someone needs to do this legendary character justice.
0553381695|5|I'm just loving George R. R. Martin's Book 2, A Clash of Kings (A Song of Fire and Ice). It's like a visit with old friends. I'm enjoying following the adventures of Arya and Jon, even Tyroin and the rest of the gang. This book is every bit as good as the first...and I eagerly await reading the rest of the series!
0792844890|5|This hilarious Star Wars Spoof by Mel Brooks is awesomely funny , it stars Rick Moranis as Darth Helmet , The late John Candy as Barth, and Mel Brooks as President Skroob /Yogurt .

They decide to invade planet Vespa, and steal their's, the only one who can stop them is Lonestar and his right hand mawg Barth.

B00000DHRX|5|When I first listened to this album, I had only took my sister's cds and then listened to it. When I listened to both cds, I was truly amazed at the songs GM sang. However, I am not a GM fan.<br />George Michael, in my opinion, has a really beautiful voice and sings some of the most excellent songs in the world. I come from that so called &quot;generation&quot; of grunge and stuff, but hey, it's a free country.  <br />The first cd, For the Heart, I think has a lot of soulful ballads. One of my favorites is Praying for Time which I think is very true, the world can be so selfish. I also liked Heal the Pain which I found very smooth as well as Father Figure which I think is also very meaningful. Careless Whisper is still one of my most favorites with the music and the lyrics well fitted.<br />The second cd is the one that I liked most. I liked Faith, it got me tapping automatically and it's very addictive. Also, I liked Freedom 90 which is another great song which I think has great lyrics. The media can be so mean, I guess. Too Funky is excellent for the catwalk and I Knew You Were Waiting for Me has great lyrics and music.<br />In the end, I think this is an excellent album with GM's greatest hits and songs. However, I didn't like the Asian version which didn't have Monkey. The US version is my favorite. Buy this album whether you are a fan of GM or a collector of songs.

B0007P3582|4|When I look at what happened between 50 and the Game I wonder how much better this album could have been. 50 claimed to have helped Game on 6 of his tracks and can be heard on 3 including Hate it Or Love it my favorite from the Documentary. All the songs that 50 says he helped out on are some of my favorites and would have made this one near 5 mic status. Out of 21 tracks on this album I find a VERY solid 8 tracks worth listening to and that's without Piggy Bank Disco Inferno and Candy Shop. And God Gave me Style is one of my favorites to just sit back and relax to. I took that song and burned it on a mix CD and was playing it in front of a friend who really hates 50. He liked that song so much that he went out and bought the album. If he had kept the Game songs on this album I think over half these posts wouldn't be here.
B0009P42S2|4|Good movie,well made,the animation is great,as with one other movie i reviewed,was a gift from a good friend and not a movie I would have considered for my collection,but as I said the animation IS great and if you are a collector of animation(well made) then you can shortlist this as something inexpensive for a gift if asked.Kids will love the movie (atleast the ones here do!).

B009MYARIK|4|I really enjoy Sophie Kinsella stories. She has this wonderful way of taking every day life experiences adds a dash of chaos to it for good measure and you have a wonderful delightful story. Wedding Night was no different super fun with great characters.<br />Lottie is such a fun character full of life, a romantic, in love with Richard her long term boyfriend, and she is slightly compulsive when things don't seem to go right. What do I mean by this is Lottie and Richard are headed to dinner where Richard wants to talk to her. Well her idea of what should be talked and asked about at dinner is a completely foreign thought to Richard. She expects a wedding proposal from him, and has psyched her self up for it. You can image Richards thoughts on the matter as he tells her no not going to happen, and he tells her his big news. Lottie is so heart broken being the romantic she is, yet she is strong and gives Richard what for in her head, stupid man. Lottie is quite cute as she process all of this. Fliss is Lottie's sister who has just been through a gut wrenching divorce and is bitter, bitter, but trying slowly to overcome the bitterness. Surprisingly she was hoping Richard and Lottie would get married, she really likes Richard for her sister.<br />Well Lottie is as if she were the waves of the sea being tossed to and fro she is devastated about Richards rejection. One day she gets a call from an old summer fling Ben, and decides to meet up with him. They were once very good together well so she thinks. Over dinner they decide that it would be a great idea to just get married. What was she thinking, she is a crazy girl. Anyway Ben is rich, sexy, and a dimwit in my opinion. He is so puffed up on himself sometimes I wanted him to get a reality check. His puffed up self really came from his lack of self confidence. There friends and family are none to happy about the upcoming wedding. Fliss is trying to talk sense into her sister but nothing seems to work. Lottie and Ben decide just to eloped and go spend there honeymoon where they first meet. This is a honeymoon like no other, it was hilarious, frustrating, and ends well with all. I loved how it ended. There is also more than one relationship going on in this story. Richard he has somethings on his mind too.<br />Really a fun and enjoyable read!<br /><br />content: clean read, sexual things talked of but no details, fair amount of language
B006G3MZRQ|5|I loved this movie Nick Nolte gave a great proformence as the father. He has not been in to many movies lately but this movie clearly show he is still an A list actor. I loved this movie the story was amazing, with pleanty of gray area too be explored as the movie got better. The fight scenes were real and beleavable and the acting was to. This is one of my top ten movies now. Dont pass this movie up. Watch it.

B00R2LZ41K|4|It was a great movie with great actors (although Ian McKellen looked worn out because is now older than the previous movies, kind of backwards they should have touched him up with CGI), and CGI.<br /><br />The movie was a bit short and of course contrary to J.R.R. Tolkien's book.<br /><br />Is the movie worth the rental, yes.<br /><br />Is the movie worth $14.99, to own, no, I'd wait for Amazon to lower the price.

0743496736|5|I've read 4 other Jodi Picoult novels, all thought provoking but Nineteen Minutes will always be the one that rises above the others. Her obvious painstaking research clearly pays off as we are drawn into such real-life characters & situations that we read about in the newspapers all too frequently. Amazing work!

We still have to work at it, but being with someone you love is very worth.  This book is mandatory for married couples.

0375842209|5|I saw the previews at the theater and decided to buy it to read prior to seeing it at the show.  Once you begin the reading journey, it keeps your attention.  I found myself (when I had time) to stop and go into the &#34;book thief's world&#34; to see what was going on in her life.  It is a great read and of course better than the movie.
078322611X|5|This is a fantastic film, fantasy, heartwarming, and indulging. First off, this film was filmed where I live, Dubuque, Iowa, was the double for downtown Boston, Dyersville, Iowa is where the field is, and still is to this day. Galena, Illinois, a quick 15 min. drive is \\"Docs home town.\\" I don't love this film because it was filmed here, I love the meaning to it. I lost my father years ago, and wish I could have a last chance to chat, this film truly touches the heart. I tear up everytime at the ending, and I'm 38 years old. Some people don't get it, ease his pain, is Ray, ( Costner), the whole film, voices are all for Ray, he doesn't know it,(neither do we), remarkable ending. Also, my car is the 23rd one driving to the field at the ending. Some good friends from school played the ghost players, and I got to party with Timothy Busfield for an evening, hell of a nice guy. The visuals are great, soundtrack is awesome, and the film delivers. Last word, people love The Wizard the Oz, this too is makebelieve, but that is what films are for.....too escape, indulge, let go, and believe. This is a great film, well worthy of it's Oscar nominataion for best picture. Enjoy, and Iowa does rule. Visit Dversville, Iowa, and see this magical place. You can play ball, run the bases, visit the gift shops, sit on the swing in the film, and even the lights are still there. This site is well maintaned and kept up. People visit from all over the world. Personally, my first at bat, I struck out, 0-well, no cameras were involved.

B004HZXORA|5|These films look amazing in their much-anticipated BD release.  People giving this box-set poor reviews and detailing every tiny little item they have a problem with miss the point of suspension of disbelief.  Some seem to forget that when someone makes a film, a work of art, a device, tool or basically anything at all, it's their creation and not the viewer's. I'm of the opinion that if you create something like a film, you have every right to make changes to YOUR creation as you see fit.  Whether its to correct an error, take advantage of updated technology to create special effects, change dialogue for clarity, advance the story or just change the tone of a scene then that is YOUR choice and no one else's.  If I made a film that happened to gain popularity, and later made changes that I wanted to make to MY original creation, who is Jon Doe to tell me I ruined it or to tell me that I'm suddenly a horrible film-maker even though 20 years ago I was their favorite film-maker?  I can understand the viewers who prefer the unedited film simply prefer to watch that version, and if they do, they should keep watching that version.  But to dedicate so much time detailing every criticism of the changes that I decided to make would just baffle me.  Okay, so the new versions aren't exactly the same and you dislike some or all of the changes.  Don't watch it or buy it.  It's that simple.  But as creator and owner of the film, I pretty much have free reign to do with it as I please.
B00BAXFECK|1|This book is incredibly boring!  It's very long, very wordy and the words are the ramblings of a teenager who is drunk, high and crazy.  Yes, he had a horrible life but I couldn't continue to read about it!<br />I cannot believe this book won a Pulitzer prize!  Yuck!
B00DUGCLY4|5|Finally!A game that I can apply some brainwave use to. Reminds me of the bottle caps from when I was young.

B00003CXIP|5|This is the kind of movie that you can watch with your family and everyone will enjoy it.  I found this to be a great movie, a tale of coming of age, and enjoying an adventure with your friends.  This is the type of movie that you cna watch over and over again, and never get tierd of.  I recomend this movie highly for everyone and there family!
B0070Y46UY|5|What an amazing book.  I couldn't put it down. After slogging through 50 Shades of Crap, Life of Pi is a breath of fresh air  It called up so many emotions in me.  I cried, I got angry, I got sad.  Not since &#34;The Power of One&#34; have I sobbed like this while reading a book.  It's beautifully written!
B00BIPCY14|5|An amazing show. Well written, fast paced, unexpected twists and turns. Very entertaining. Can't stop watching!
B004TI5N38|4|Very good plot - the author kept you off the real threat until near the end.  Characters were well represented and parts fit together well.  Fate of heroine was a surprise. Both self and wife read the book and would recommend it to scifi and action book readers.
B005DOKM9M|1|Item does not fit Kindle Fire HD, i travelled overseas with the item so Im truly upset it cannot be used to protect my device. I was cheated.
B004TTMYQG|3|If the minimum OS version is Android 2.0.1, why does it not work on Kindle Fire?<br />The Kindle Fire needs a calendar app to sync with Google and this looked to be the promising one.
B000FS9FCG|5|I had only seen this movie once before I decided to buy it on DVD. I love it, there is a somewhat brutality to the storyline, which I compare to Nazi Germany and 1984 although I expect that this was the intention, The fight scenes are highly clever, this definitely comes from its origins as a graphic novel, they are a bit like Kick-Ass in a way, only darker and of course this was first. The film questions what it is to be human - freedom to love, freedom to speak etc - and leaves you wondering what it is you value the most in this sense, what could you give up and what would you fight for. The fact that we never find out the identity of V is so important. The fact that at the end, all the characters that were supposedly gone, all showed up meant that we questioned what was real and what was all V's creation. A beautiful, well created film that everyone should watch at least once. I loved it. The DVD itself was really good, great quality film, very crisp and real feeling.
B0097EWK3A|4|On my kindle fire hd it seems the controls aren't as sensitive as th we y should be. But once you get it it's better. Having lots of fun though. It's only my second game like this so I may be the problem.
B003TSEEDY|5|Funny. I started reading it and this took place my senior year in high school. The imagery took me back and made me connect. A great coming of age piece.
B00EJU8ZIG|5|It's a pretty cool album but I'm afraid the radio ruined several songs for me.
B00WMKK8KS|5|Outstanding. Every track and every musician shines on this album. The guitars are blazing, creative, energetic, melodic, and brutal. The drums are the best they've ever been, and following in the footsteps of Nick Barker on the first four albums, that says a lot about Marthus, who has been outstanding since his arrival on Godspeed. In my opinion he saved the band from total suckage back when Adrian finally left. The keyboards are a great mix of classic Cradle atmosphere and new effects; they offer a lot of variety and depth to the guitars. The bass actually serves its function as a part of a proper rhythm section for the first time since Robin Graves left the band. And Dani hasn't sounded this good since Nymphetemine. In some ways it's his best record, he's never sounded this nasty (if he'd sounded this good on Darkly and Manticore, those albums would have been a lot better). Strong melodies and catchy-as-hell guitar licks are balanced by ugly and nasty thrashing in every song. Schoolcraft's vocals add that old Sara Jezebel Deva element that hasn't quite been there over the last few albums.<br /><br />Even with high expectations for this album, there was one thing that really surprised me. The lead guitar work! Interesting, wild, technical, fast, melodic, and a lot of feel. Fans of Nevermore's Jeff Loomis should be happy, I know i was.<br /><br />Finally, hats off to Dani for another batch of unusual lyrics. The loose theme of the album is mother nature's revenge on the catholic church (and mankind in general), and she's pissed. Hopefully thise lineup stays together. If so, this band has a future, and its fans have something to look forward to! The first listen through this record reminded me of the first time I heard Cruelty and the Beast when I was a teenager; I couldn't believe what I was listening to!

B009NZQDW2|5|Awesome Movie!
055352626X|4|Bill Bryson's &quot;I'm a Stranger...&quot; is an interesting collection of observations and comments about several aspects of American life.  As they are taken from weekly columns he wrote for a paper in England, this is not a &quot;book&quot; per se.  But that fact doesn't take away from its charm, or, at times, stinging criticism.<br />This is mostly a humorous work, like the article Bryson wrote poking fun at the US Federal Tax Return (wait 'til you hear it!).  But it's not all light-hearted; Bryson also finds time for more serious matters, like immigration and gun control.  His analyses of these situations and his expose' of inconsistent American values/beliefs is worth the price of the book alone.  Sometimes it takes an outsider, like Bryson was, to show you things you couldn't see yourself.  He does this splendidly.<br />Others have commented that the book was a little too formulaic; I have noticed this too.  Many of the articles end with a &quot;punch-line&quot; of sarcasm, and it seemed a bit predictable the more I read.  For this reason I would recommend not reading too much at once.  It worked better for me listening to one or two themes at a time, and then taking a break.  The material (and Bryson's approach) remained more fresh that way.<br />In all, though, this was a good effort.  Bryson definitely makes you think about issues you might have taken for granted.  Four stars.
B00DQR26EC|5|This game is awesome, it is available on 360 as well. I highly suggest it to any gamer. It has so many easter eggs and off-hand references to other games, that it is almost a game just trying to find them all. I thoroughly enjoy it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Super fun<br />Addicting<br />Difficult<br /><br />Cons:<br />There are no real guides if you get stuck somewhere<br />No way to really view the whole map other than the small pop up map in the top left of the screen.
B00DPM7TIG|4|This was a suspenseful book which had several subjects all going at the same time, but I kept hoping for the book to go in ways in which it didn't.....(I don't know why).  I found myself getting frustrated with the book because it didn't go in the direction I wanted it to, but I truly realized that I didn't WRITE the book.... It was a strange experience, and one I have never had before.  It was still a good book several stories woven into it.
0767819446|5|I saw this movie because I was bored and walking by the theater.  I thought I would be killing time for a couple of hours: I was wrong, this time was not killed, it was extremely well spent. The thing I liked best  about this film is that it doesn't take time out to explain things, but  rather simply shows you the situation, and leaves the understanding to you.   In other words, it does not insult your intelligence. Its theme is similar  to that of The Matrix, Dark City, and ExistenZ.  Having seen all of these,  I would rate this one the best of all of them.  While I enjoy cinematic  gunfire and explosions as well as anyone, I do enjoy a film which does not  feature a lot of this sort of thing, and instead relies on the plot itself  to keep the story moving.  This film is one such. The movie posters said  &quot;Question Reality.&quot;  I am now following that advice.  I would  rate this film as the best I've seen this year.  Now I'm just waiting for  the video to come down in price.
B00Y6QF0PE|4|I felt that this was well-written from Christian's perspective. It's certainly true to the first book and it was a fast read. It's always nice to read a book from another perspective. I think I almost preferred his perspective? ;)
B00FAPF5U0|4|Great game...So addictive....Can't put it down
B00JBGSHSQ|5|Interesting and artistic take on the timeless Genesis story.<br /><br /> People had mocked and laughed at this film when it first came out, but after having a second look at it on DVD I found myself enjoying this very independent and loosely based on the banned &#34;Book of Enoch&#34; take on Noah.<br /><br /> The &#34;Rock Transformers&#34; characters the &#34;Nepheliem&#34; unfortunately are not given enough of what I would state a satisfying origin explanation, so one has to do their own online research in order to figure out what on Earth these creatures are, or what they have to do with Noah.  I had felt emotionally drawn to the Nepheliem &#34;Rock Transformer&#34; character, for at least I felt his pain and anguish.  I really cared about this character, and liked him, I found him to be a character driven by honor and duty to his creator God, selflessly sacrificing himself in order for Noah and his family to live.  We feel his purpose and loss, and his soul is redeemed.<br /><br /> When I first viewed this film in the theater I was surprised to see how different a take this was, and made statements such as &#34;I don't remember that being in the story!?&#34;  But after reading accounts and mythological tales of the &#34;Book of Enoch&#34;, and other myths related to floods I could see where the film makers with actor Crowe got these different characters from.<br /><br /> The &#34;Tubal Caine&#34; villain in this story was another &#34;Who is this dude? I don't remember him?&#34; moment in the story that I actually enjoyed seeing, bringing a human adversarial &#34;Darth Vader&#34; like character who confronts Noah was a fun and interesting element the film explores.<br /><br /> The History Channel's &#34;Bible&#34; epic was excellent but did not do the Noah story enough justice, so I was glad that now in contemporary pop culture media that Russell Crowe had made a film focusing on Noah's Ark where other genres simply did not touch the subject.<br /><br /> Anthony Hopkins was enjoyable in this role, although I agree with some of the public critics claiming he came off too much like &#34;Yoda&#34;, but how else does or would anyone portray a character that old and magical?<br /><br /> Assuming actor Russell Crowe, I can only guess that he has passionate views on conservation and the environment, has themed this movie on preserving the natural world and even protecting animals.  Was that the same theme from the Biblical story?  It is hard to say, although its obvious that other creatures of the Earth had to be protected and saved, which was one of Noah's roles out of many, but the primary theme was that mankind had lost their way in debauchery and vicious wickedness.  So many cruel acts of sadism and criminality occurred that the universe's creator, God, believed man was to be destroyed using the flood to make it happen.  Noah's belief in God's promise and word had brought forth his own survival, and the survival of the wild animals of Earth who needed to be restored to the fresh lands so they can survive and repopulate.<br /><br /> Interpreting my own passionate beliefs about what events occurred during this pre-historic period of human time, this fantasy depiction can be generally accepted Biblically, but also with some added artistic Hollywood flair.  The Book of Enoch mentions creatures such as these depicted, and the character of &#34;Tubal Cain&#34; the blacksmith metal weapons maker who might have also been a dictator warrior type, is mentioned in the lost book of &#34;Jubilees&#34; because they mention his linage back to Caine via the son of Adam and Eve.<br /><br />This film is not a masterpiece, nor an Oscar worthy piece of filmmaking by any standard, never the less it is very entertaining and enjoyable to watch.  Hope more films are made of Biblical related themed stories in the future, even a Gnostic Bible movie may come off as being very fun to see.some of the public critics claiming he came off too much like &#34;Yoda&#34;, but how else does or would anyone portray a character that old and magical?

B0073XV2W2|4|Ravens, and ants, and drones and bears - oh, my! I made it up about the bears, but the ravens, ants and drones are all there. The key elements of the story line could well be tomorrow's social media headlines. How can one man stop the development of a swarm of autonomous drones that are armed and able to select, track and kill their programmed targets without human control? The question is especially meaningful as without an answer it will mean the end of civilization as we know it. The author blends a knowledge of biology, terrorism, technology, and human nature to keep the reader turning pages to learn how the world is saved. My only reservation in giving a five star rating is that the ending leaves a few very important loose ends. Perhaps they form the basis for a sequel. If so, I will be one of the first in line to read it as well.
B00BMKH5NW|5|I LOVE, LOVE this book. I love and relate how socially awkward Cather is: the non-exsistant flirting skills, escapes to her own little world (slightly embarrassed), and a deep fear of new social situations. Like me, her way to solve the awkwardness is to never leave the house.
B00BHMETKC|4|Catches the moment and place in time. Well acted, directed and paced. This story while compelling for those involved,<br />might have been a difficult one to get viewers involved. Ben Affleck succeeded in engaging his audience. Maybe not<br />Best Picture level compared to other years, but it's very nice to see something story driven without the need to rely on CG,<br />huge budgets and Johnny Depp to pull them along.
B007IXWKUK|4|Book 2 is every bit as much a page turner as Book 1. Can't wait to start Book 3.  They're still having sex on every other page, but the sub-plot(s) thicken(s).
B00006690G|4|* WHITE AMERICA: Eminem seems to be the only person in the public lime-light that can speak boldly, freely, and demanding against the Government and not have a thing done about it. Then again, he earned his place to do this and prove free speach is a welcome thing and anyone against it, should be smacked. I enjoy this song because it's retalorating against those who agree with everyone and think everything's peaches&creame.<br />* BUSINESS: After all the songs he's written and produced as a land-bomb towards all those who doubt him and talk 'ish behind his back, this one kind of tops the cake. Although, I prefer his one with DMX and Obie Trice who I dedicated to my ex-boyfriend, \\"Go To Sleep.\\" It's more violent then this track. If you're avoiding heavy-paced profanity and violence, stick with Business.<br />* CLEANIN' OUT MY CLOSET: The first 10 times I heard it, I enjoyed it. Then I got the CD burned and it faded. If I could write a piece against my family and not be sued, I'd give praise to Eminem. But I'm not looking for a lawsuit nor a murder so I'll leave that to Eminem to fulfill. I like this track because he, in my opinion, throws out words to Mother's like his own. Nobody's perfect but you don't have to purposely pull strings to make it worse.<br />* SQUARE DANCE: Funny song. Heather and me would blast it while I was in TN on Spring Break and listen to it and most of the neighbor's would leave cos they couldn't stand it. Who cares? It's not his best but it shows you can be a smart-bum and still be serious.<br />* SOLDIER: Talks about the real, \\"Thugs,\\" and people who grow up in the Ghetto or who come from a harsh/hard family. It's not easy growing up in society any more cos if your family hasn't been one of the favourites and people are always trying to pull 'ish on you. Eminem, in my book, is a true survivor in many cases. Myself, and more, come from a background like his. It talks about him holding up weight that would otherwise, break any weak-minded andweakened soul person.<br />* SAY GOODBYE TO HOLLYWOOD: Despite the fact I admire Eminem, no matter what kind of commotion he may stir up, I believe him wanting to take a break now and work out the personal life he's trying to have is for the best. He'll cut tracks, break records, and such but I'm glad he's grown up and taken time to realize the important things in his life. I admire him moreso cos anyone in his position never tries most of the time nor do they appreciate where they're standing. They try to do it all easy. Despite all he's had to hold up, he finds time to be a Father. Not many guys can do that and own up to the greatness of it. Mine couldn't, anyway.<br />* DRIPS: Funny but not my taste. To downlow and the lyrics don't grab my attention like his older work.<br />* WITHOUT ME: I prefer the serious/I-Wanna-Slit-Your-Throat Eminem. The qircky (sp?) one kind of annoys me.<br />* SING FOR THE MOMENT: Never will get bored or tired of/with this song. I'm surprised I haven't worn the CD out from playing it so much. He speaks truth on certain issues in America. Kids putting up with abuse. Kids or Teens wanting to be a, \\"thug,\\" \\"gang member,\\" etc. I'm not sure why people who weren't raised in that kind of enviroment would find that kind of life cool or adrenaline-rush-driven. \\"When you live by the gun you die by the gun\\" - Tupac Shakur. I lost close friends to this life. Eminem redid a song and put his views, which anyone will agree 95% of the time, that if you're dealing with 'ish, you can turn this track on and leave it behind. He also talks about people who take 'ish too seriously.<br />* SUPERMAN/MY DAD'S GONE CRAZY: Funniest songs on the whole CD. My Dad's Gone Crazy is possibly the cutest but funniest song he's made. Other then Drug Ballad, old favourite.<br />* HAILIE'S SONG: Pretty explainable. Sweet but I think he should stick to rapping. He sings good though, if you don't mind low-note keys.<br />* WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS/SAY WHAT YOU SAY/'TIL I COLLAPSE: Anger-ventment songs.<br />I've always admired Eminem for the fact he speaks his mind without holding back or biting his tongue. Not too many artists feel free to speak and do this and those who can are those whom I'll respect until their grave no longer exists. I prefer his older stuff over any new recent tracks. He always amazes me with beats and lyrical content. I always find 1 song that always suits me and can represent me. I can't give it a 10 because it's not perfect but well put together. 9.5 fits it perfectly.
B000JMKNVK|4|The author writes a tight story. You want to solve the crime right along with Kenzie and Gennaro. The author makes you emotionally connected to the characters by exquisitely filling them out so that you love them, hate them, or are repulsed by them. And believe me, there's more than one of each of those characters.  This is a good read.
B002XISFGS|5|I have purchased this disc as it is advertised at \\"Region Free\\".  However in the detailed description it is listed at Region B/2 which does not seem to include the US.  But it plays in my PS3 without problem.<br /><br />I was in my early 20's when this film came out.  In my childhood I watched TOS premier on NBC.  There had never been anything like it on television. Color had just come in a few earlier and luckily we had a color set, albeit with a round screen.  I vividly remember all the talk about the green Leonard Nimoy. When NBC axed TOS, I knew this show was not going away for eternity. Then the re-runs started and finally ST1 TMP came out. Star Wars also came out shortly after and the debate started.  I think these are two different animals and each is glorious in its own right.<br /><br />Little known history is that ST TOS owes it existence to none other than the great Lucille Ball. She and Desi had broken up and Lucy had assumed running Desilu. ST TOS along with Mission Impossible were brought to her. Everyone else had turned down ST, but she gave the go ahead and the rest is history.  She was truly a GREAT in film and television history.<br /><br />This disc is pristine and  a must for ones SciFi library.  As I reminisce over the years and watched the progress of film and television, I just enjoy what we have today. This BluRay places ST where we all knew it should have been. I met Mr. Roddenberry and his future wife Majel Barret in NYC at a convention at one point. I'm sure Mr Roddenberry is turning over in his grave...to watch his creation in magnificent glory that Blu-Ray has given to the series.
B0094BB4TW|4|So I updated Facebook because of the warning that was at the top of the page... so I did and now I can't even open Facebook on my kindle anymore!!! It tries to open then says Facebook has stopped!... this is ridicules
B00B8M4IMK|5|Great charger. Simultaneously charges my wife's iPhone 5C (cable not included, but you can get a good one cheaply on Amazon) and my LG G2 with no issues. Very happy with this purchase.
B008XG1X18|5|Works well with my kindle.  I love being able to manage my favorite recipes, crafting ideas, and gift ideas.  Yahoo!
B0017KIBAI|4|Great product. Buttons are really crisp and the controller is sexy all around.  So crisp you'll blisters on the pad of your left thumb. We all have to make sacrifices for what we love. The start button is a little weak, but my life is too fast paced for pause.
B005EVVESM|5|This was a gift for my wife and she was very pleased to receive it for Christmas.
B0063IH60K|4|SO ENJOYABLE
B00L9B7IKE|2|Very depressing about people with problems made worse by those closest to them.
B00A7CI82I|5|I watched 2 times so far and will watch it again and again great movie. It's worth it thank amazon. Bye..
B0051UP5NQ|5|Very nice app. Turned my Kindle in mini computer. Haven't touched my laptop since I added this app. Highly recommend
0307277453|5|Although the author is a bit wordy at times, he does break down the chapers into excellent little conceptual components.  The pieces of the evolutionary puzzle are nearly fully in place, and the author lays them out elegantly in general with simple yet profound illustrations.  Wonderful contribution to any library.
B00JEPQ48O|4|Loved it and I learnt so much more about the most beautiful animals in the world
1400031346|5|I just loved this book.  It will quietly draw you in and take you to another world.  I went to Botswana for a brief trip last year and fell in love with the country and I love reading McCall's descriptions and his own love for his country through Precious.  This is not a book full of wild, bloody action, so if you're looking for that, you will be disappointed.  Rather this is a wonderful escape from the harried world of the U.S., written with charm and love with characters that are fresh and that you wish you could meet in real life.  I read the Tears of the Giraffe last week too and it was even better, introducing more wonderful characters.
B008BQ8VOC|4|We have a goofy theme about a genius who can't get through school but is practicing law and all the co-conspirators helping him. All I can say is I like it, and I want a job like these guys.
0399255370|5|A great book to use to get the kids to write from a different perspective.
B00CRS88IO|5|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada is an example of a novel ready for the big screen.  Damian has assembled all the essential characters from WWII and put them into action.  We are comforted by the scenes we remember of France, the Resistance the Vichy, the Germans, Nazis and Allies.  We have seen so many movies of this conflict that it's easy to visualize the scenes in our head.  Add a James Bond lead character and you have the perfect script for the theater.  That's the best part of the book.  Damian puts you in the action with vivid descriptions and details that bring the scenes to life.  His background in screenwriting is certainly evident.  If you like James Bond and stories where the Nazis get their butts kicked, you'll like this novel.  Now he should write one about Bond and the Vietnam War; maybe we can win that one this time.
B001ANSS5K|5|Paper people living in paper towns. I meant to do my homework half an hour ago, but finishing this story seemed more important. A paper story whilst thinking about paper towns. How appropriate.
B00097A5HW|1|I am sorry, but this is the WORST EVER Cd she has ever released in her career. I am so DISAPPOINTED in her.
B0060Q962Q|3|This is an ok game. My grand daughter is smart and did get bored with it already. She was 6 then.  If you try to.play this fast, it does get more exciting.
B006LSZECO|4|While most loved this book until the ending--I loved the whole thing. The ending was anything but predictable. Did it end the way most want? No--but that's what makes it so great!
B003O86FMW|5|I loved reading this book. I can not wait to read the next one. This was just really good reading and normally I do not like to read
B000055Y0X|5|THANKS!
B00ES250W4|5|Love this set.
B008AT9XOC|5|5 stars because it got here fast. Just in time for valentine day. glad i was finally able to find this movie.
B00CF34B2I|4|I have played both offline and council version of Magic, and have to say that this edition of it isn't that bad. It can be a bit slow at times but it makes for it in the area of detail and information of what is happening. There is nothing worse than when something happens and you have no explanation of why, this app eliminates that question.
B00IKZX1ZI|2|When played this game it seemed a lot like candy crush. The 3 differences is that it puts olaf on the front instead of candy. 2 the name of the game is different. 3 it use candy. This really ripped off candy crush a lot. I suggest you don't get this game
B0071QIN00|4|this game is awesome. the only problem was the main menu flips upside down no matter how you have it. on the kindle fire he.
B005K0HDGE|2|I won’t give an overview of the plot as there are many reviews that have done a much better job that I could do.  I will though give a brief review of why this book is a disappointment.<br /><br />The premise of time travel is great and the backstory of the assassination of JFK made me certain this would be one of Kings better books. I was wrong.<br /><br />The first half of the book is page turning and it quickly dies off from there. Great plot scenarios end up disappointing and there are so many clichés I found myself skipping forward to confirm my suspicions.<br /><br />I imagined King writing this novel, having fun but trying to find that magic that he has brought millions of readers over the years. He failed miserably. He alludes to it (I won’t give any spoilers) and he also desperately wants it. But in this book it does not happen.<br /><br />I would suggest Mr. King to buy a Schwinn and take a ride and then perhaps he may find that magic once again.
B005LAJ22Q|5|The 2nd season was a little dramatic but I still love the show.  Great price and shipping. The product came undamaged and I am very happy.  I would order again for sure.  Thank You Amazon!
B00006BTCA|5|Well, I saw Interpol in concert a few months back and was mesmerized by their sound. I immediately thought of Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, Bauhaus and My Bloody Valentine, all in one band. I strongly recommend this album, I got it after the show and just can't get enough of it. Later, a friend said to me &quot;it is a musical past back in a new form.&quot; I'd rather think of it as music in its best form.
B0049J3QNG|5|Awesome! My daughter watches it on repeat!
B0089LOG02|4|Great book just can't believe children we're put in those type situations.but I guess people had to do want had to be done
0062252747|4|The book is full of good info and motivation, but reads a little slow - I read a lot, but this book does not hold my attention.
B00IJJUIMY|5|I have read all the Harry Bosch books.  It has been interesting to see how the character has evolved. An entertaining detective mystery and police procedural, as usual.  Connelly is one of my favorite authors.
B00F8F3J2S|4|As befits a vigorous, intelligent and peripatetic Secretary, Gates' book is filled with details that reflect a habit of diary-keeping. At times, one is overwhelmed by the details, but the final take-away of this book is how little we learn from history.  America does not appear to have changed the trajectory of history in any of the small wars we have fought over the past hundred years--obviously, I make exception for the big wars, WWI and WWII.  Gates' interactions with Afghanistan's leader Karzai are a lesson in point.  As I write, we are once again to learn that Karzai simply cannot be trusted and we as a nation do not understand the web of relationships among the non-Western countries we have tried to help.  I am tempted to use the term &#34;two-faced weasel&#34; to describe Karzai, but that might be because, like Gates, I have no clue how the various cultures and personalities really intertwine.  A final thought:  Gates would have benefitted from an editor.  A little too much extraneous detail is probably the result of the diary-dependence.  Jane C. Webb
B003JTHXOK|3|Safe Haven is a nice story. Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful writer. Enjoyed the book on a quiet snowy day.
6305177473|5|I saw this movie in the theaters because I'm a movieholic . I thought it was real good, and that's it.  But then I fell in love with the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot;, the new one, which stared Natasha Richardson . I went  head over heels for her (dearly not quirly) and thought she was tremendous  . Then I made my mom rent Parent Trap . I watched 4 times in the past three  days and hope to buy it soon . It is prefectly marvelous ! Lindsy is great,  Natasha's wonderful, Dennis is fun, and the buttler and nanny are beautiful  ! Halirious and highly recomened !
B00003CXHJ|1|It is refeshing to know that some of the American reviewers of this film recognise the absolute fabrication this movie makes of the Enigma capture.  WWII British intelligence repeatedly advised the US Navy of the existence of a Nazi 'Enigma' machine which was coordinating U-boat attacks on US vessels but the information was ignored - much to the United States peril - they went on to lose multitudes of ships and human lives all along the eastern US seaboard.<br />It was not until an British vessel 'accidentally' found the machine on a captured U-boat that the actual device could be fully studied and was enough evidence for the US to finally take appropriate action.<br />Would it have been such a commercial trade off to have told the truth if this story was supposedly based on fact?<br />Mel Gibson must have practised on this one before he created 'Patriot Fiction' later in the year!!!
B003MC5N28|4|The Giver was a very interesting and exciting book about a couple of communities that are under the restriction of everyone being the same.  This story is a well written one about a boy named Jonas that is elected for the highest position in the community.  It is a strange concept because they don't know colors, animals, hills, clouds, heat, cold, rain, or snow.  All in all this was a very good book because I always wanted to see what was on the next page.
B00H7VB7TS|5|Amazingly awesome... The franchise keeps getting better.. Loved the movie.. I recommend the film to any one.. Well done!!!! OMG!!!
B00J8CGU64|4|Good
B00KOUIBRU|5|$15 to protect my camera and reduce drops. Worth it. wouldve been better if they included the rubber for the other side of the camera to make it look better.
B00H57OXSG|1|Uninteresting story line, with no redeeming features. Total waste of money, both an abuse of the cast and  the intelligence of the viewing public.
B00M4ADWTK|5|Amazing movie
B00CWY76CC|5|I wish the game was longer, but it was great while it lasted. The game provides those genuine \\"aha\\" moments that are often absent in real life. Waiting for a sequel.
B000CDINOK|4|I would rate this dvd 5 stars if it wasent for the shoody camera work that looks like it was filmed by an hyperactive child suffering ADD, & a lack of 5.1, also brings down the score. Apart from these setbacks i highly recommened it just to hear the crowd singing along to your favourite tunes...
B00BD99JMW|4|Loved this book and the action and friendships that were shown.  There were times that I wasn't sure what would happen next, which was my favorite.
B004IAH7UE|5|This movie is a must see.  It is right up there with Thelma and Louis, Beaches, Steel Magnolias... pulls at my heart strings.
B000XUBFE2|5|Would recommend it to friends. Good book.
B0089EHWQE|4|I thoroughly enjoyed this book although I had a sneaking suspicion as to how it would end- and I was right.  If you are looking for an easy read with good character development and love, then this is your book.  Not to say it isn't sad, but the book it worth the read.  Perhaps one gains a new understanding into the minds and hearts of the disabled, or a relationship that can develop between wto very needy people who find hope in one another.  I found myself anxious to read to the end, which is a beautiful testament to love and what &#34;it&#34; can help to conquer.
B008XBCJ34|5|There isn't much I can say here. The movie was great on the big screen and is great still on my 60&#34; TV.
B00F7YHDWC|5|Dumb ways to die is a great way to teach kids to be careful. It even has a cute music video to go with the game.
B00BAXFECK|4|I thought it very well written, but a little lengthy.  Too much philosophizing,and too many scenes of drug use.  Perhaps I spent too much time reading it rather than completing it faster and absorbing more.
B008JMKN4Y|4|Great fun to read. NA voice was spot on. The chemistry between the characters was palpable, and I think that's what kept the pages turning. While I understand a lot of people's issues with the volatile relationship, I don't think it destroys the story. McGuire doesn't condone that behavior, but shines a light on it. If all novels were about perfectly behaved people, readers would be bored out of their skulls.   My only issue what that I felt like the story could have ended a lot sooner. IMO, the thickening of the plot took away from rather than added to the characters' connection. But I still loved reading about Abby & Trav, and missed them once I was finished reading.
B00000J7SS|5|... Miles was not a nice person.  He was notoriously difficult to work for and work with during his career - yet produced some of Jazz music's most influential albums, hired the most talented and promising musicians in Jazz, and forced record companies to change the way they did business with Jazz artists.  \\"Bitches Brew\\" is the album that truly typifies the kind of musician he was and the brilliant artists he demanded to have with him.  Personally, I prefer the be-bop Miles Davis, but this is the album that contradicts itself, an argument back and forth between convention and avant-garde, with improvisation from start to finish.  If \\"Kind of Blue\\" changed the structure of Jazz in it's time, then \\"Bitches Brew\\" changed the tone of Jazz music ... forever.  It may not have enough melody for some, but it's got more color than anything he's ever produced.  And frankly, he needed to record this album to release his electronic demons and eventually follow up with \\"Jack Johnson\\" (1970), \\"Live-Evil\\" (1970), \\"Agharta\\" (Live, 1975), and \\"Tutu\\" (1986) ... just to name a few.    Buy this album.  You may not like it's raw sound, but you have to listen to it in order to really understand the great revolution of Jazz and why we have acid rock/jazz, progressive rock, and eventually new wave music.  Buy it, listen to it, and then share it with someone who is new to modern Jazz.  It's hard ... it's fringe ... it's amazing ... it's cool.  It's Miles.
B000ATQYT2|5|Charles Dickens' classic is one of the best books ever - I read it once a year near the Christmas season.  But when they started making it into movies they started to screw it up.  Some of the movies were great, some were awful to the point where they make me when to kick Tiny Tim.  It was if something was missing.<br />When I saw this movie on the big screen, with my Dad, when it first came out I realized what was missing.<br />Charles Dickens voice!  That third person voice of the writer that fills in the details and tells us what we need to know about the history, background, and characters.  His voice sets the mood and helps keep the story moving.  Good thing for us Gonzo was there to stand in for Dickens.  No, really, it makes it one of the best movies to ever follow the story - Gonzo as Dickens really helps keep the setting and mood of the original.<br />Also, Kermit, Miss Piggy, and Michael Caine REALLY help bring it all together.  And, yes, Michael Caine sings.  This IS a musical!<br />Of course, you should also read the original story, so I suggest getting [[ASIN:1456407872 A Christmas Carol]] to read on those cold, winter nights.
B000FC1HBY|5|Continuing the journey in the series! I love love love love love them! Yes, I'm trying to get the minimum word requirement for a review ;)
0316227706|5|I gave the book as a Christmas grab bag gift and it was a hit.  Plus it was shipped quickly.
B000FL7CAK|5|Second season continued the great things from the first, for the most part. The first season was just so excellent that that made it pretty hard to equal it in the second season.<br /><br />Still smart, still funny and still sassy! This season's arc focused on a bus crash, who and why. We get to see more of Wallace and Weevil. Plus Joss Whedon makes an appearance!
B00HZ3C4N6|5|thrilling
0385336810|5|Generally speaking I think Sophie Kinsella's books are the best contemporary Chick Lit I have read.  Can you keep a secret? is my favourite book of all time in that genre.  I wont try and describe it as I don't want to give away one precious secret other than to say that this book is as good as it gets - IMHO.
B00GY0HJ4K|4|This game is quite a bit of fun. Keeps me occupied for a long time. Some of the levels make you have to think a few moves ahead. Enjoying.
B00000K2SC|5|I have seen this movie over ten times and I still enjoy it.  I find that the action and the alternate reality thing going on keeps me hooked onto the movie.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Not just for kids.  I get a great deal of satisfaction from each level.
B00GX598FO|3|Don't expect too much and you'll be entertained. Not as good as the first one which was maybe 3.5 stars
B00005QGAX|4|It is obvious that \\"Bad\\" was not on the same level as \\"OTW\\" or \\"Thriller\\". And it's also obvious that \\"Bad\\" would not surpass \\"Thriller\\" in records or sales. The music here was just too different--still superior--just too different. This one actually had \\"filler\\" per se (Speed Demon, Liberian Girl, Just Good Friends), though it did have 5 #1 hits (thought their chart longetivity was not as long as \\"Thriller\\"'s cuts). It all appears that Jackson tried too hard to beat \\"Thriller\\" (hence the 5 year waiting period for \\"Bad\\") and it shows in the result. Regardless of how funny some of \\"Bad\\"'s music may seem (this IS the late 1980s, so I'm not picking on just Mike), particularly the title song, it is still fresh and enjoyable today. Standout tracks include: \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", \\"I Just Can't Stop Lovin' You\\", \\"Man in the Mirror\\", \\"Smooth Criminal\\", and the lashing-out-at-the-media \\"Leave Me Alone\\" (which would become all too serious in later years). Overall, this is still quality music.
0307951529|4|Author Chris Guillebeau has a lot of programs on his site including an Empire Building Kit. I signed up for it a while back, and every day for a year I got an e-mail from him on how to build my empire: solid advice, a handy tip, a new idea, bold inspiration, a profile of someone who made the leap already and more. Really great stuff.<br /><br />In \\"The $100 Startup\\" Chris gathered a lot of his awesome how-to material in convenient (and cheaper!) book format and expanded on it with new up-to-date info, tools and plans on how to get stuff done, how to build your empire. It may not apply to ALL startups (especially not ones that require a lot of cash/equipment right away) but if you can start small(er) and then build up, then this book rocks.<br /><br />I offer \\"just\\" four stars because I'm not a fan of the style of telling stories of people who have made this or that idea work. It's a bit of a cliche format for this type of book, and while interesting, many of the people have very different circumstances so their stories may not apply to me. I would have preferred more cold, hard factual information--maybe workbooks or checklists--and less of this sort of narrative. It's not a big deal, but I find it a bit distracting.<br /><br />However the bottom line is this book's a great tool to build your empire.<br />So click \\"Buy,\\" read it, then let's all pedal toward the future we want.
B009ZQJ1G4|4|This movie came out around the same time as The Matrix, which is why movie audiences largely ignored it which is a shame because this movie deserved its chance to shine. Equilibrium has a solid story about what we sacrifice in order to achieve utopia and how what seems to be paradise (shocker) often has an unseemly, hidden side. The story is old but the execution is solid and the performances effectively propel the movie forward. Cool side note: the slick martial art in the movie, gun kata, is actually a real thing and was created specifically for Equilibrium.
B003NRYMZQ|4|Good serie.
B0036EH3TS|5|Good movie
B000RPTQ1C|4|The copywright protection can give you problems when trying to rip the CD to your computer then trying to copy it to an mp3 player.  Great Music though.
B000001F7R|5|From the heavily distored opening riffs off 'Rock Brigade,' to the slow building and fading of the closing song 'Overture,' there are sensational guitar solos, some amazing druming, and catchy lyrics, set against an all around &quot;Stop, Drop, and Rock&quot; album.        This was produced in an abandoned warehouse in December of 1979 and released the following month. The minimal production is almost non-apparent, and one of the only indications that Def Leppard was running on a very low budget was the absent of there trademark Byzantine guitar layering. But a harder, rawer, sound is what makes this album so esential. Much darker and heavier than any effort after 1983's &quot;Pyromania,&quot; this album is the reason why I consider Def Leppard, together with such late 70's-early 80's bands as Motley Crue and Van Halen to be one of the main influences on later eighties bands like Poison and Cinderella to name a few.         This album has a little of eveything on it: No-holds-barred arena rock can be found on 'Rock Brigade,' 'Hello America,' the live cut of 'Rocks Off,' and 'Satellite.' There is evidence of almost poetic lyrics in 'Answer to the Master,' (My favorite song off the album) and 'When the Walls Came Tumbling Down,' (Which starts off like an english fairy tale narrated by Richard Kyle and progresses in an almost Metallica like prophecy of doom) 'Wasted,' is about a man driven to an almost suicidal drug addiction by a woman, a song that would later come eerily true when their first lead guitarist Steve Clark O.D.'d on Pills and Alcohol. Tracks like 'Sorrow is a Woman,' and 'It Don't Matter,' are angrier and up-tempo precursors to the later hits 'Bringin' on the Heartbreak,' and 'Love Bites.' Overture is Def Leppard's longest song to this date, the guitars fade in and out of complex riffs and slow, melodic, notes. And then there's 'It Could Be You,' non a bad effort, but not remarkable either. The only &quot;C&quot; song in a plethora of &quot;A's.&quot;<br/>    The only thing missing from this CD are the Ballads for which Def Leppard is most famous. But when you are ready to crank it up and get your 'Rocks Off' this the album to do it. And it should definately be in the collection of any Heavy Metal fan. And in fact, just so fans can get an idea of what Def Leppard is truly capable of this album should be sold, as is, along with &quot;Vault,&quot; for it is one of their best.
B00ADQCBEY|5|I had no idea how good this show was or how much it makes you think about what is right (?) and wrong (?).
B0000DD7LB|4|I must say, I was quite worried about the quality of Britney Spears' next album when I first heard \\"Me Against the Music.\\"  Let me just say that the first single off this record does not even come close to how amazing some of these tracks are!  This album embodies so many different styles of music - from hip-hop to trip-hop to rock and even techno.  <br />The slick, club-worthy 'Breathe on Me' is definitely a highlight of this album, with it's sensual, pulsing beat and seductive lyrics.  \\"One love united, two bodies synchronizing, don't even need to touch me baby, just breathe on me.\\"  Is it hot in here or is it just me?  ;-)  <br />'Toxic,' a song that compares dangerous men to a drug addiction, is one of the most innovative songs.  It's a turbulant mish-mash of distorted strings and grinding static.  Very trippy and VERY catchy.  <br />Quite the opposite is the tender ballad 'Everytime.'  Its delicate and effective blend of piano, harp, and strings compliment her fragile-as-glass singing of a lost love.  People tend to think of this song only as \\"the song Britney wrote about Justin,\\" but I love to lay in bed and actually listen to the music - the beautiful orchestration and the heartbreaking lyrics.    <br />And of course, we can't forget the infamous and sexy 'Touch of My Hand,' in which Britney sings of exploring her body \\"in a most precious way.\\"  The verses are decorated with dreamy Asian strings before evolving into the funky and catchy chorus.      <br />Several people I know who have listened to 'In the Zone' have a newfound respect for Britney Spears.  There is something appealing for almost every type of music fan.  The whole album is definitely worth listening to!
B00005NWM3|2|From an unbiased point of view and an avid hard rock fan, I gave this album a fair try, but after completing the album, I found myself wondering how this band is so popular.  Most of the songs are either easily forgetable or repetitive, lacking in diversity and catchiness.  It's the type of songs you can listen to for the first few times, but after a while you get sick of hearing it as it lacks any flavor.<br />Recommend you pass on this one.  Recommendations on albums to buy this year would be Incubus &quot;morning view&quot;, Stone Temple Pilots &quot;shangri-la dee da&quot;, Pod &quot;satellite&quot;, and Linkin Park &quot;hybrid theory&quot;.
B0026P3G12|5|When I first heard Susan Boyle on the U-Tube posting, I was simply blown away by her beautiful voice and masterful interpretation of her song.  I have been anxiously waiting for this album ever since and it has not disappointed.  The song selections are marvelous and her voice and interpretation for each song is just amazing.  Every time I hear her sing \\"Wild Horses\\" the hairs on the back of my neck just rise.  She is a treasure and hers is an amazing story of triumph and of fulfilling a dream.
B00H71PHS0|5|Great show that continues to entertain.
0385510454|3|I remember finding my first John Grisham book in a bargain bin at the mall.Neither I nor anyone else knew who he was then.I read A Time To Kill without stopping and instantly became a fan. There have been some books I have enjoyed better than others. Mr. Grisham's ability to introduce us to interesting characters, watch their development and explore how those characters interact and relate to all around them is a true joy. <br />This book does none of that although the potential is there. Having coffee and learning a foreign language is less than that. Characters come and go through the book without us getting to know them.  <br />So much was blah, blah, blah, oh - I had better make something happen - blah, blah, blah. <br />This could have been a great one...but it really is a significant disappointment.
B004GYY714|5|I listen to this everyday at work, with little interference. I love that you can find the type of music you listen to from talk show to 80's/90's.
B00F8H7DYQ|5|Such a funny gift for the Breaking Bad fan!
0385344430|5|Another winner from Gabaldon.
B009AMAM9S|5|I don't think anyone would have previously associated the word arty with the Waschowskis but that indeed is what they've made with their good friend, German director Tom Twyker.  Some would consider Twyker arty but indeed all three make the leap here.<br /><br />The best way I can summarize this film is by saying it is NOT linear.  It does not unfold along the usual lines.  All sorts of experiments are ongoing throughout about telling a story out of sequence and by flashing to different characters in different times from way back in the past to way forward in the future.  The characters are involved in reincarnation to an extent but that is only one small part of this film.<br /><br />It took me about half an hour to get used to the constantly shifting action of the film but after that I really liked it and thought that it moved the story along very well. There is a lot of action adventure in the film so if you are expecting a slow pace because it is arty, it is NOT SLOW.<br /><br />What is the film about?  I'd say it is philosophical and embraces life, death, families, continuation of lives in other guises and above all creation in every form.<br /><br />There is so much going on that I really feel as if I need to see this several more times.  I am sure I will see so much more with every viewing.  That is the mark of true excellence.<br /><br />I am sure there are going to be people who hate this film.  If you hate arty films or foreign films, I think you may be one of them.
B0073LWEXK|5|This game is excellent. Very well thought out story and no lag or anything. I still cannot figure out myself how certain people rated this bad because they couldn't figure it out? Give me a break! That's what type of game this is! If your really that slow go play bubble pop, but don't go rating the game bad.
B004FGMDOQ|5|The story sucks you in and the pics make it even better! I would suggest this book to kids and adults alike-
B007SGLZP8|4|I enjoy the way it keep going and I didn't know what was going to happen next. It kept me on edge.
B00CWY76CC|4|Fun game to play to pass the time. Not to easy not to hard. Good for me little to try to play as well.
B00IG2DOKM|4|it's OK
B008JFUTUY|5|One of the best movies I have ever seen - honestly! At first when I realized it was a documentary I was disappointed, didn't take me long to become totally engulfed in his story. Amazing!!!  Anybody with any interest in music at all should see this!
B004ZRV3AU|5|Works great! Have had many bottle turn out perfect. It does take a little practice to get the technique right so don't start with a bottle you absolutely want. The scoring and hot to cold water technique works best for me I have had much success with it and hopefully will get all the glasses I need.
0517543052|4|Interesting
0380973464|4|The beauty of Stephenson's work has always been the depth of research into the subject, and this is no different. Although Cryptonomicon is not sci-fi, i think it will still have enough technical jargon to keep the  cyberfiends interested, with story flashing from a modern day information  storage company to second world war ancestors of these characters. The  second world war stories are based loosely about code breaking (funnily  enough), the effect that it had on the outcome, and also, the lengths that  were gone to to hide the fact that codes had been broken. Stories of  different characters merge and split with gay abandon, leaving you  wondering who will meet up with who next, or who's relative will emerge in  the present day story. To be brief, it is a joy to read. Technical data on  code breaking which could have started to bog the book down, becomes as  easy as 'pooning a cab in Stephenson's agile hands. Don't get me wrong, it  is a different read to his past stuff, but with the promise of more books  in the series (not sequels, just more people with a connection to crypto)  it may be the brink of a new style. If you can get your hands on the  hardback copy you will see that the attention to detail does not even stop  in the narrative, with pages cut to different sizes in order to  artificially age the book. Great story, beautiful book, fantastic author.
B00544L9EI|3|i odered this record, downloaded it, and #3 would not download. it kept saying \\"download failed\\"  so, i'd retry and i keep getting the same message. think they took the whole price for the record too....i hadn't even listened to it yet either...
B00JPCCJFS|3|First book was great, second - also loved it. But as for third - I had an impression that Ken wanted just to finish writing. I miss characters, miss story, seems like everything just led to the moment when Black Barack Obama became the president. There wasn't a single word about World Trade Center, so many things happened, but last 20 years just vanished until the election in US. Earlier I actually could imagine the person, her/his feelings, behaviours, but in this book... With every page the author just wanted to close the story and that I didn't like at all. I just hope that next time Ken Follet will have more time for writing...
034580404X|5|Good price and I loved the books!
B007V508CC|1|Very disappointed in this album. Maroon 5 has sold out and become too mainstream. Their first 3 albums were great but this one sucks. Wasted my money. Have only listened to it once and was disgusted. The only positive was the seller. CD arrived in great condition  by the promised time so the seller was great!
B002JVWR4U|5|I though this was a fantastic mind challanging TV series. The amount of twists, turns and possiblities of technology highlighted was fantastic. The story line was a little fantastic at times but enjoyed it.
B00881VLCE|5|I'm only 11 but I liv this game! I really liv the cats because they r so cute! The babies r adorable!
1451666179|5|I love Allie Brosh, and have followed her posts since her blog first started.  She has a knack for making people laugh at topics that are hard to discuss (such as depression).  This is not a comic book, to be clear.<br /><br />You should read this book if:<br />(A) You like dogs.<br />(B) You or someone close to you has gone through depression.<br />(C) A bunch of other reasons.  YOU WANT TO READ ALL THE THINGS!
B0084IG8TM|5|first of all those of u who give this movie 1 star obviously have no good taste in movies. thumbs up to lawrence and i cant wait for the second movie!
B000069HKH|4|The most popular Springsteen has always been his songs that overwhelm you with reverly, such as Born to Run and Jungleland, where the E Street Band plays to the max, inundating one with guitars and keyboards and saxophone all playing at maximum energy.  But I feel his best songs to me have always been the ones where the tone and tempo of his songs are mellow and haunting, which give you that acky pain in the gut and the chest.<br />I feel that way about his new album.  The title track is a great uplifting song, and songs like 'Countin on a Miracle' and 'Mary's Place' remind one of Springsteen's past classics.  But, to me, it is a song like 'Nothing Man' which captures the pain of the times and the events that are the &quot;inspiration&quot; for this album, while also expertly seizing on the nobility of ordinary people that endure in extraordinary times. That song is painful to hear, yet I cannot stop playing it over and over.<br />And I guess that's the point of this album.  Its different and there may be songs on the album you won't like, but there is a song that will capture you in some way.  While 'Nothing Man' is the song that haunts me, I also really was caught by 'My City of Ruins', 'Paradise' and 'Lonesome Day'.  This is not the Springsteen of decades past, but he can still write powerful songs to consistently capture the tone of this country's heart.<br />Just a couple of other things.  I do not think Springsteen is exploiting 9/11 because a lot of his songs don't directly address the tragedy, nor does he wrap the album around that incident.  Again, 'Nothing Man' is about the nobility of common man without reward through adversity; it could apply to many situations.  The song 'My City of Ruins' was written pre-9/11 about Asbury Park, although the lyrics could easily apply to 9/11 as well.<br />In in all, a fine album.
B000A6CLL0|5|It was exactly what I wanted. Exactly as advertised. I couldn't be happier with my purchase of this. Thanks a lot!
B00MB6IYHW|5|Great
B005PK57IK|5|Another season that hits the ball out of the park, GREAT show!
B00OMLRSPI|3|A lot of repetition of the same scenes
B0051ANPZQ|5|BEST BOOK EVER! It was very deep. It had lots of meaning. This book made me cry, laugh, and fell emotion for August Pullman
B001FVV2X2|5|I absolutely love this show! I'm hooked and I hope it never ends. This show satisfies my Engineering and scientific mind.
B00VFTD43A|5|I thoughly enjoyed watching this movie, and would love to see movies on others who have made significant advances in technology but have been lost to history.  While I hated the ending (Alan Turing deserved better).  I very much enjoyed the movie.  I will have to pickup the book again.  It's been along time since I read about Alan Turing and his work.
B00F1BFRA6|3|First disc won't play completely. Stops and freezes in places.
B000FA675C|5|Loved this book beyond belief. Some of the theories are very believable to me as well. Can honestly say I learned a few things from it even though it is under fiction. Dan Brown's writing is so well done as well I felt like I got a chance to view some places in the world, I even looked them up online his writing is so interesting.
1936608898|5|Changed my life, diet and overall level of living.<br /><br />I hate the fact that more people don't care about where their food comes from, or how it's 'made'. Set on 'industrial farming' and 100% processed foods will just kill our country from the ground up. Literally.
B00G4CXHSK|5|This is a great game for all ages. It has a good assortment of weapons and is both fun and puzzling.  Yes, Noddlecake has done a great job with this game.
B004GJDQT8|5|I love the Prime membership options when purchasing certain items. It definitely helps when some items are needed right away.
B0071QIN00|5|Great game but level 13 is super hard any suggestions on how to beat it? Any help would be appreciated very much!!!!
B005IQZB14|2|not exciting.......hope the movie is better
B003XF1XOQ|4|This book was easier to put down than the other two but I still found it enjoyable. An interesting trilogy!
B000002L99|5|Delivered as expected
B00HNEQRNK|5|Amazing! Real Potential for more great stuff
B008JAGZDE|4|Just as funny as the other movies were. I t was great to see the storylines tied up and see that chemistry between these once never heard of actors and actresses. Enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5|My Grandson downloaded this on my Kindle and he absoutly loves it.  He plays it all the time.  I have to make him take a break from it.  Very ejnoyable for him.  Thank you
B008JFUOWM|5|As good as all the others, keeping the collection going. This did not disappoint and looking forward to future sequels.
B005F8CL1S|5|Very nice collection for a very reasonable price.  One reviewer complained about the paper sleeves, but most of us will use these CDs in one of two ways (or both): We will rip them to MP3 and then put them away, or we will put them in a 200-CD changer and leave them there.  It's a nice boxed set.  Cohen has evolved beautifully as an artist, so of course you will want his later releases, but this set does an excellent job of showcasing the first half of his career.
B0045HCIZY|5|I just LOVE this (now) trilogy! I am happy to have this in my DVD collection! Excellent film, and great entertainment!
B009A87ZQU|5|Good addition to my library
0385484518|3|My dad bought this book for me after he had previously read and enjoyed it.  I agree with the people who think this book is somewhat cliche, but what interested me was the information about Lou Gehrig's Disease.  I really didn't know anything about it before, so in that sense this book was eye-opening.  It is a very scary disease, and I really hope a cure is found for it ASAP.
B00A27X972|2|I had a hard time getting into the book. I couldn't put myself in the position of the the \\"being\\" and that made it difficult for me. I only read about 7% of the book. I realize that setup is everything in a book and I tried to get through it, but couldn't. Not my cup o' tea. I did really like the premise, though.
1400069807|1|Wow, reading this is like watching paint dry. The title suggests it will be more investigative, exposing any variety of controversies related to Big Food. Well, I'll save you $20... here is the book:<br /><br />1) Food companies work at using the exact amount of salt, sugar, and fat to make a food taste the best. Similar to when you cook at home.<br /><br />2) Lunchables used to be expensive to make. Now they aren't.<br /><br />3) The companies don't care much about obesity and do care about profits. You know, like basically every other publicly traded company on earth. Shocking stuff.<br /><br />All the thematic analogies to Big Tobacco fall short.<br /><br />Meh. This really isn't a book, but a collection of short stories related to processed food that do not particularly illuminate anything novel.
B004V5QWU2|5|this app has amazingly realistic and comforting sounds. i always thought these sleep machines were silly but it works wonders! well worth the $1.49 :)
B00DPM7RJW|5|Loved this book so much. It completely sucked me in. I love how it is not a cliche love story where you are led to believe only one person can be for you. It is extremely realistic while remaining positive and romantic.
B00530FC6O|3|Cute story - did not realize but seems to be part of a series.  Chose it as I had heard of Wodehouse but know anything about his writings.
B000NA28I4|3|Whoever cast Ed Speleers with his very limited acting experience is the reason this movie is below par.  It could have been much better if the lead actor didn't smile or grin in every scene, especially when a scene was supposed to be sad or tragic.  Where was the director?<br /><br />If you are starved for fantasy, this movie is OK if you give a pass to the part played by Eragon.
B0046B8GEQ|5|My granddaughter loves this. She is just 2 .<br />Loves to spend extra time watching it.
B007SYWFRM|5|there are so many things you can do. And I have never played anything like it. I LOVE IT!!!!!! There are so many things you can unlock and play with. Its really out of this world.
0061122416|5|The Alchemist is an eye-opener when it comes to learning to appreaciate the simplest things. A lot of enlightening statements and lessons to learn from this read.
B00B8M4IMK|5|My new Ankee car charger is awesome it is a great addition to my other Anker products, thanks again Anker.
B00005JLD4|5|This is a \\"must see\\" movie for everyone.  Very few people are even aware that in the mid-20th century there was a long term serious attempt by the Australian government to \\"breed out\\" the entire Aborigine race. This is a fantastic movie based on the true story of three Aborigine girls during that time.  I would recommend watching the special features before watching the movie for a fascinating look at how the young girls were chosen to act in this movie.  WOW!
B00FAX6XQC|4|This game is total rockets! The only thing keeping me back from giving it 5 stars is the loading time. It really takes a while when I start up the game. But it really is awesome.
B003ZSJ212|5|Star Wars is the best saga of all time, so I cannot wait til release date to watch all the films and the extras on one week marathon.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game my children love! Another reason we love this game is because its kind of addictive! This is a WONDERFUL game!
B009UX2YAC|5|Subway surf rocks. The first game has been a blast. The game has been a<br />PERFECT sense of the real thing.
B004ZWKWQQ|4|This Lego set is a great deal. The price is unbeatable and my son loves this. This is also great value and will provide entertainment for a long time
B005IQZB14|5|Great book, read it before the movie comes out!
B005LY4B0A|5|I love this game.  Very challenging later on, but also very fun!  if you like puzzle games, give this one a shot.
B00BN2NY48|5|AWE INSPIRING
0380789035|5|I was born in Wisconsin and spent every summer there until I was about 16. Many of the roadside attractions were favorite stops on the way up or on the way back home to Kansas. I vividly remember the House on the Rock on one such visit.<br /><br />Growing up in Kansas the &#34;geographical center&#34; of the USA in Smith County was another familiar day trip.<br /><br />From Chicago to Mt. Rushmore I have visited most of the places in the book and that made the story more interesting.<br /><br />The premise of the story is original and compelling, a nice mix of mythology and magic from all around the world. It is the classic American melting pot told from a different point of view.
B00K4P7TEG|1|Not very interesting..but hey it was free.
B0000DD7LB|5|Wow- I was really impressed. I haven't really listened to britney much lately because her older stuff sounded kinda childish and pop-ish. But I was really surprised. I got the Cd for christmas -bc I liked the song with madonna and expected the rest of the CD to suck - and just be typical britney - but it's not. It's got alot of different sounds and better beats on it. I would definetly recomend this! It's worth the money - most of the the songs are really good - and not the typical teeny bob stuff she was putting out.
B006DJ2JSI|5|This is not only a handy source of information for correct spelling of words and locating the definitions, it gives the preferred pronunciation of most words.  I didn't realize how many rarely used words I had mispronounced until I installed this on my Kindle Fire.  It is much easier to use than the hard cover dictionaries of the past.  An added advantage is the fact that it is much lighter to carry.
B00577WFZE|5|Love him
B00DHKKN6Q|5|Great game!
6304708483|1|Of all the billions, I am shocked that they have made no effort to provide subtitles.
B00BSB2AE4|5|Allie Brosh has a unique way of seeing things and puts them on paper I'm exactly that way. I thoroughly enjoyed following her reasonings and descriptions...<br />Laughed out loud innumerable times! Excellent!
0671027344|5|A Review by Amy<br />Charlie writes to an anonymous reader about his daily life of how his life is and becomes. Charlie goes through a lot of different events of is first year at high school. Charlie runs into drugs, alcohol, smoking, sex , teen pregnancy, aloneness, abuse and a lot more. But then Charlie also runs into great things as well friendship, first dates and being apart of something instead of just watching. Charlie shares is good times and bad times and his most deepest thoughts in this letters to someone he doesn't know. <BR>I really enjoyed this book a lot! What I liked about it was that the author created real teen scenarios. For an example peer pressure caused Charlie to start smoking. I found a lot of these scenarios I could see happening to a lot of people. Another part of this book I loved was the author wrote it really well so that reader would get involved with the story. For an example when he had feelings towards Sam and didn't tell her I just wanted to tell him that he should tell her! Another really good part about this book was that the author made you always guessing what is going to happen next? Like when Charlie came home one night after a party and was writing all weird I just wonder what was going on then later I found out that he took LSD. There were a lot of surprises in this book that was one of the many reasons why I loved this book.<BR>I recommend this book to people that want to see what some teenagers have to deal with and that life isn't so \\"peachy\\" all the time. I would also recommend this book to people that have a lot of problems to deal with so that they can see that they are not all alone that there are people out there like them.
B00CO8D3G4|5|Great little book and we'll worth reading.<br />James has an authentic enjoyable writing style.<br />James is a natural talent and generous human being.
B00C7TAF3Y|1|I paid for the game and I only able to play the epilog and game 1.  All other games in The Room &#34;Lock up&#34; when I try to play them on my Kindle.  What a waste of money.
B00021HBGS|2|Had hopes that our grandson would love playing w/this during bath time.  However, the foam pieces would not stick to<br />the tub wall as advertised.
B000FU7ERW|5|In my opinion, this is Zeppelin's best album. Along with one of the best album titles of all time, the track listing is immaculate.
1897299214|2|2 Stars for all of the work the author put into the book but..     the book reads like a sunday comic strip. Short disjointed moments put together randomly and often quite repetetive.     The author strikes an always judgemental or condescending tone throughout and his observations rarely strike true chord of pathos. Just Western dogma and superior  attitude.    Most of the book seems like the author constantly complaining that about what HE cant have or do...HE cant have good food...HE cant get a bicycle..HE cant go out.     I cant think of too many moments in the book where the author hits a deep note of empathy for his subjects that might illuminate true feelings in the reader.     I had high hopes but was greatly disappointed.
B008QLXSG8|5|Though the main character was almost entirely emotionless the entire time in a sort of humorous way,I loved the book. I liked the message it sent to me and the way it was written that kept the reader entertained. I have never read a book like this but so happy I did. One of my new favorites.
B00DW39B2K|1|The entire family was groaning for this awful movie to be over, simply unwatchable.  One (previously?) good actor, and one semi-decent actor do NOT add up to even an average movie.  Just bad, bad, bad.  Skip this one, you'll thank me for it.
B009ZXT4BY|1|this thing SUCKS it is sooo stupid you buy tittle then it says you have to buy it again to keep playing don't get this app your just wasting your time.
B0051GOB26|5|How can you ever go wrong upgrading your favorite movie from DVD to Blue Ray, but you get cool extra stuff with it.
B000002LUB|5|this has got to be, by far, some of the best material either Sabbath or Dio has ever released. a small part of me wants to say that this is better than Dio's 1st album with Sabbath \\"Heaven and Hell\\" but that record is too much of a classic to be outdone. Dehumanizer is by far the most overlooked album i've ever seen.<br /><br />Computer God: genious opener, great lyrics and vox by Dio and hard riffs by Iommi all the way through.<br /><br />After All (The Dead): this one took a few listens to truly appreciate. the harmonies in this one are great<br /><br />TV Crimes: the best song on the album bar none. it plain out rocks like no other with the heaviest, yet catchiest riffs i've heard on an album like this.<br /><br />Letters From Earth: more great and heavy riffs by Iommi. i prefer the rare alternate version of this song but the one that appears on the record here is still great.<br /><br />Master Of Insanity: still rockin', but not as much. it gets a bit repetitive but that only cuz the rest of the album is so good that even a good song like this looks bad compared to it.<br /><br />Time Machine: perhaps the most overlooked gem on this album, simply, its awesome<br /><br />Sins of the Father: a little less heavy but in a good way. good lyrics too.<br /><br />Too Late: the albums attempt at a \\"ballad\\". a good song but doesn't really fit in with all these other heavier songs<br /><br />I: my 2nd favorite song on the album. riffs are great, solo rules, and Dio's vocals are at their best here. plus its got genious lyrics.<br /><br />Buried Alive: haven't gotten into this one till recently. once again (i find myself saying this alot) very heavy and many different riffs here. i love it.<br /><br />Time Machine (Wayne's World Version): nothing real special here, but its neat that they put it on. worth listenin to once in a while.<br /><br />overall very awesome album. one of my top 5 favorites of all time. buy it now!!!

B0030IIZ4M|5|Toy Story is a classic kids movie that is fun to watch for all ages and is one that our kids have not outgrown nor grown tired of.
0765316994|5|REDSHIRTS' premise, on the face of it, is comedic. It makes me remember the exchange from Big Bang Theory, that we know we're not in the Matrix because the food would taste better. In this case, we know we're not in the real world because the guy in the red shirt ALWAYS dies on the away mission.<br /><br />It's a fun, fast, satisfying read - but then, something happens. The ending, much as in life, is NOT the ending. Three Codas examine the other side of the story, the effect of the fictional world on the real world. How fiction informs it, reforms it, improves it. It's in the Codas that REDSHIRTS becomes more than a nifty logic puzzle with pulse guns. In the end, it's a thank you to the people who imagine - and who share their imaginings with a world in need of them. While they're not our creators (probably!) they do more for us than they, or we, can ever know.
0061992860|5|it is a good source of information for any situation.
B00LP1MVSW|5|Numerous senaruos, Best weapons, great graphics, awesome background scenery and colors...I could go on and on.  The bottom line is that this app is top notch!

B0029LCJJS|5|Well done historicaly
B00AB7HESI|5|Best game to play. You can  share your creativity and make up wacky inventions!! I love it because I can do tasks that are really fun!! Get this app and you will fall in love with it!!
1572704756|5|David Suchet does such a great job with all of the characters, not just Poirot! Makes me look forward to long drives.
B00H3JHH6Q|5|Great history of the music scene in Muscle Shoals. Great story and great music. Lovingly done. I wish there was a soundtrack CD.
B00005ASHM|1|Tears came down from my eyes while listening to this album , as I could not stop YAWNING.How childish , tedious and boring stuff . One star too many for this .
B00E0MCYPS|5|this is awsome,  ignore the negitive comments love the game. perfect controls, perfect graphics this is best rally game (to me) ever!
B00004X0M6|5|En estos tiempos en los cuales la musica banal domina el hit parade, un disco como &quot;Entre tu y mil mares&quot; viene a recordarnos el poder de la musica hermosa. El cd es una coleccion de bellisimas canciones que tocaran tu alma, provocandote escalofrios. Es la magia de Laura: tal vez existan cientos de cantantes con mejor voz, mejores arreglos y letras; pero pocas, muy pocas, trasmiten lo que Laura con sus canciones. Es como una buena amiga que siempre estara ahi para abrazarte con su musica.<br />Compralo, cierra los ojos, relajate y dejate llevar por la magia unica e indescribible de esta mujer.
B005LAIH2M|5|This movie is great if you like sci-fi action. There are plenty of good looking ladies to look at, and the movie is pretty bloody as well. It is very entertaining! I will watch this multiple times for sure.
B00DAXYNEI|4|Good program.  Enjoyed it very much.
B0089LOG02|4|I really liked this book, an enjoyable read.
B001ANSS5K|1|Just awful.
B00GTCECVG|5|Awesome game! love the server and am really desperate for some free gems. I have 0 gems right now and I'm a beginner, but i still love the game.
B00BVYNSLC|4|Intriguing
B0034G4ORC|5|My husband and I watch it every chance we can.  We find it to be somewhat stereotypically &#34;apocalyptic &#34; in theme, however great faces by good actors and some outstanding lines.  We loved the ending, so go USA.
B0063GORYU|4|Works good but the kindle screen doesn't drag and drop accurately.  I have this same  app on my Sanding Galaxy Nexus phone and the play on that device is superior.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Good
B000059TEQ|5|I love, love, love this movie. This movie had my attention from beginning to end. It is a true love story and an example of a happy, healthy relationship between a man and a woman. I am not a professional movie critic, however, I know great cinematography when I see it, and \\"Love Story\\" is definitely great cinematography.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I love this game it is sooo fun
B000QCS8TW|5|I've never been much of a reader, probably having read about 10-20 books in my life, but this was impossible to put down. This book was so addicting that I powered through it in about 2 weeks. The points that stuck out to me was the character development, the story twists, and with no real &#34;one&#34; protagonist (although the Starks are portrayed as the &#34;good guys&#34;), the reader has the opportunity to pick their favorite family and cheer for them throughout the series.  A good read for someone who likes stories about the medieval age, warfare, politics, and adventure.
B007X16GFC|5|It was alright.
B0000026NC|4|The overabundance of tracks from &#34;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&#34; on disc one is the only thing that prevents me from giving &#34;Delicate Sound of Thunder&#34; five stars. It's a shame that most people forgot about this great live Floyd album after &#34;Pulse&#34; was released. While the latter clearly has s better setlist, it unfortunately sucks. &#34;Delicate Sound&#34; is the definitive live Floyd album (unless you count Gilmour's &#34;Live at Gdansk&#34;) and, in my personal opinion, is their best album cover.
B005LCECU6|5|Awesome sound quality for a 1974 show.  Great purchase.  Would recommend for any Rush fan.  Nice jam on Working Man.
B006VREHRS|5|We love this show.  Very well made and cast perfectly. Wardrobe is super.
B00D7Z4GQY|3|Liane Moriarty is an innovative storyteller. I was shocked when I learned 'The Secret'! It was a page turner from beginning till end.
B007FG9LIE|5|This is one of the best books that I've read all year. I had no freaking clue about what was going on, and the ending was stunning. I did not see that coming! I can't wait to read the next book and find out what going to happen, because I just know some weird, creepy bad stuff is going to happen. Yep, I'd recommend this book and this Author.
1609611543|1|don't waste your money on this diet. It is not going to work. I know I tried it. That is all I can say
B000N4SHPS|5|Super movie. Great Story. The second best of all the Rocky Movies. This should have been part 4. A great movie that was very emotinal, if you were really into the series. <br /> <br />Let your kids watch 1-3 and then let them see this movie for a moral view.
B006MW3UZW|5|Love the UK version. There isn't anything left out, you get to see the episodes in their entirety as they originally played.
B005COO1X6|5|Excellent read. Just wish it had lasted longer. Stephen King didn't let me down. Love his books. Keep them coming.
B000LB7G00|4|I wanted to use this for 3d work. It takes quite a bit to get used to the controls. You have to really lower the sensitivity on the controller until you know what your doing .
B0098460O4|4|love the voices and the music even though i am not a classical music fan; relaxing and fresh though old stuff :)
B00BESM14U|5|Excellent movie. Very good growing up movie. Good acting, good plot. Very solid. Emma watson is looking great,  too, which doesn't hurt.
B00KWVZ750|5|Game is amazing. Seems easy at first but gets increasingly difficult.
B007SGM084|5|Every. Chapter. Was. Amazing. I couldn't sleep because I had to finish it! Best read I have had in a long time.
B00H58VGIA|5|The author does a good job of reminding us of the brutal, inhumane treatment of slaves and the limitations placed on females during the 1800's. Even though  we do not have a perfect society, this book makes one grateful to be living in this time.
B00A77II0U|4|Great casual game. It was long so sometimes I forgot what was going on when I stopped.  Worth the money.
067443000X|5|Unfortunately there are mistakes in translations from the original french version.  The following website collects Errata.  The list is growing.    http://blog.daum.net/minchonlky/13342914

B00CWY76CC|3|Easy peasy, fun and keeps me busy when I am bored and tired of crushing candies!!!<br />Love hidden object games...just don't like it when I can't find them! LOL!
B00E7SFAAG|5|This is a good game for all ages. It's cute and addictive. it's about timing - once you press the button and knowing when to let go of the button so that granny can land on her feet or get her cane to hook onto the next bar or wire so she can still pass or get further ahead of the thief. IMO it's most important to get helmets for granny so she recovers from a bad landing faster. You're trying to get as many coins as possible along the way and also land high points for a great landing after she jumps. As long as you finish one scene you can move onto the next one. Right now I'm stuck on &#34;Underground&#34;. Hopefully, I can get through this one soon.
B00BAXFECK|3|Every sentence was too descriptive for my tastes.  It was written beautifully but after awhile, I became bored and skipped to the next action in the book.
1594633665|5|Thoroughly enjoyed this book and the crazy lives of all the characters. Easy read and was sad to finish so soon. Would like to know if Rachel got the job as she didn't make the interview and we were left without resolution.
B00FATEJYE|1|When it was downloading on my kindle fire it got all the way to the end and said &amp;#34;download failed what the hell is going on?
B00EEL0LGY|4|Fun game..
B00FATEJYE|5|I really enjoy playing this app. I find it very entertaining and would highly recommend it to anybody. It does however take a lot of time to load but the game itself is definitely worth it.
B000003TA4|5|Oh, bollocks! I know I'd come to the point with my reviews I'd HAVE to review this one also, so here it goes: &quot;Nevermind&quot; has been on practicly every TOP 100 Rock-album charts after it's release in 1991. And  when you listen to it through you will find out why. Kurt Cobain was not  the  straightest kind of lyrics-writer, and the meaning of his texts may  occasionally strike as hard-to-find. But still, despite the restlessness of  the lyrics, he managed to capture the feelings that teenagers were are  going through. But the importance of this album lays as much on the  catchy-but-clever melodies. Kurt Cobain's vocals match perfectly with the  music, Krist Novoselic's bass brings the deepness into their rage, and Dave  Grohl's pattering drums make the music sound you've being attacked by a  huge vawe of rock'n'roll noise. This album shows that Nirvana was equally  as taleted with the lighter, more sensitive tracks than with the  hardrockmonsters they becam famous from. So this album is by all means a  way more than just teh hit rack The Sm... oh, you know what!  actually, it  is not even the best track on the album. If you don't believe me, just  listen to Polly, Come As You Are of Something In The Way. Actually every  track on this album should be a rock'n'roll classic. Nirvana's success may  have got into a whole new levle after Cobain died, but it sure as hell  didn't originally cause from that. Just listen to this release and you'll  agree.
0060930349|5|Can't say enough good things. Too often people see American history as the history of government action. Paul Johnson understands that this country was founded by and for the people. The later parts of the book are controversial but apparently those are his views about what happened in this country. The book is not anywhere close to as one sided as the Howard Zinn book and he is celebrated by the same people that criticize Johnson.
B00J3ZIGOU|5|This is a great book for any 8-13 year old girl or boy it's funny, and teaches you what to do if a road trip goes bad.
B0040GYAOM|4|Great music is so convenient and cheap nowadays.<br /><br />(Twelve more words required?) (Eight more words required). Are we there yet?
B00KFUU3GQ|5|Good show
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I couldn't stop reading this. I tried and failed  ....I had to keep reading. 3:30 in the morning rolled around and I forced myself to stop....only because  my alarm was only 3 hours away from tearing me out of this wonderful world of love, lust,twists and turns. This book  comes highly recommended from me. I've already told all of my fellow ereaders that they have to get this book!
B0036EH3XE|5|I loved Lost. Receiving this last season was definitely saddening, but it was such an awesome show. I recommend to anyone with a love for mystery. JJ Abrams definitely gives it out in this!
B00AESN8XY|5|Very fun strategy game. Not recommended for people that don't like games where you really have to think. I will not lie, This game is not easy!
B00IIUATDM|5|Great performances. Unbelievable how much money can be wasted like they did. Amazing he survived with all the drugs and then that boat crash. It was very fast paced & quite the story.
B00004U30D|5|This movie is simply about the reality of life. Just as Shakespeare was able to use the human character and write many great works, so do the authors of this film. It simply is about our lives, our very deep secrets, our deepest dreams, and finally, about somebody shaking us, so we can face it. Unfortunately, life is sometimes hard to accept. But the main theme of the film is that &quot;there is awesome beauty everywhere&quot;.<br />The acting was also superb!
B008Y6UEL2|4|Cute little movie.<br />We all enjoyed it!!
B004J4WKUQ|4|I likened this book a futuristic Charlie and The Chocolate Factory - really clever storyline.<br /><br />It is really for a younger demographic, teens I'd say, but my women's book group enjoyed it overall.  Entertaining.
B00CO8D3G4|5|This book is beyond self-help - it's more like self-kick-in-the-*ss.<br />Highly recommended.<br />I have purchased several copies of this book for friends.
B0071XO8RA|5|5 stars was an easy decision. My first attempt to read Wool failed because the writing was too effective. I just crushed all five game of thrones books and I didn't know if I could deal with another story that seems hopeless and kills off all the good characters. So it was more a matter of timing. I later sat down and started it again and finished in a few days. Loved it. Also the first book I ever bothered to review. If you haven't read it yet, you are doing yourself a disservice no matter what your preferred genre is.
B00G3L6KQI|5|Long-awaited finale fulfills promise of first two books. I never wanted it to end!

B00ID4I0FM|5|I am disappointed when a weak movie gets rave reviews and vice versa.  All the negativity for Ender's game made it that much more enjoyable.  The original short story and the subsequent book are classics, and this movie does a great job of retelling the tale.  Even the strange use of &#34;email&#34; and dropping the name &#34;Buggers&#34; did not bug me much.  Me thinks the critics need to chill out a bit.  It's just fictitious entertainment, and the creators did a smash-up job.
B000FA675C|5|Another great story from Dan Brown.  I found it almost impossible to put down once I started reading it.  After hearing all hype about this book I read it and as far as I could tell it was just an exciting story but just a story.  Dan Brown takes a number of facts, some theories & plenty of imagination and puts them all together into a compelling book.
B000008LNS|4|&quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; is a lost treasure in Toto's large body of work. Released in Europe in 1992 and in the U.S. one year later, this album was only in print for a relatively short period of time. This is rather unfortunate because &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; is quite a strong effort and shows an edgier side to the band that's not always present in their other works.<br />After a short-lived disastrous stint with South African singer Jean-Michel Byron as their front man, Toto temporarily disposed of having a lead vocalist and carried on as a solid four-piece group consisting of drummer Jeff Porcaro, his brother Mike on bass, keyboardist David Paich and guitarist Steve Lukather who handles all the lead vocals on this album. The absence of a front man brings out more of Toto's solid musicianship and extended instrumental passages (only two of the album's 12 tracks are under five minutes with the rest being between 5 and 7 minutes long). Lukather's guitar work is at its best here and he proves to be no slouch as a vocalist singing both the ballads and the rockers.<br />Standout tracks includes the metal-rocker &quot;Gypsy Train&quot;, &quot;Never Enough&quot;, &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, &quot;Wings Of Time&quot;, &quot;The Other Side&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Jake To The Bone&quot; which combines elements of jazz, improvisation and odd-progressive rock time signatures. This is a showcase for drummer Jeff Porcaro's precision-based playing and David Paich's dexterous keyboard work.<br />Although it is out-of-print, &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; is worth searching for especially if you're a Toto fan. This album has personally grown on me since I first heard it 10 years ago. I used to think that this was the band's worst album. Not so anymore. There really isn't anything on this album that sounds like &quot;Rosanna&quot;, &quot;Hold The Line&quot; or &quot;Africa&quot; however, the tight musicianship and solid group playing is extraordinary.<br />Sadly, &quot;Kingdom Of Desire&quot; wound up being Jeff Porcaro's final album with Toto. In the summer of 1992, Jeff died of a chemically-induced heart attack. He is still missed by many but his drumming as well as his band live on. This final album includes what is arguably his best drumming - another reason to seek out this album.m Of Desire&quot; wound up being Jeff Porcaro's final album with Toto.

B000002UAI|5|It's true that in first glance Beatles For Sale might seem like a step back from the excellent and highly successful A Hard Day's Night, which was penned entirely by the Beatles themselves; Beatles For Sale is often uneven and inconsistent, filled with some odd covers, and in those ways is more remindful of their previous album With The Beatles. It's also true that Beatles For Sale was made in a bit of a hurry, and at times it shows. But these observations are all skin-deep. Further listening will show that not only is Beatles For Sale an important transitional step in the band's constant process of development and change, which led to the great Help! and from there to the timeless masterpieces Rubber Soul and Revolver - it's also an integral step forward from A Hard Day's Night, and is one of the strongest albums of the Beatles' early period, i.e. the Touring Period. <br /> <br />As I've already mentioned, the cover choices on the album don't always make absolute sense; it's also worth mentioning that in contrast to With The Beatles and Please Please Me, the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team is by now skillful enough for the original songs to be much stronger than the covers, and so the Beatles included these albums not due to lack of confidence in their own songs - they have already produced an album of original material only - but to fill some time, and more importantly to add variety. Indeed, even though the covers are the weaker songs on the album, they add some different flavors to the listening experience and make it more dynamic and more engaging. The strongest of the bunch is John Lennon's excellent interpretation of Chuck Berry's Rock N' Roll Music, which is as much a rock n' roll anthem as Berry's original; it's reminiscent of the very first days of the Beatles, and especially of George Harrison's Roll Over Beethoven. Ringo Starr's version of Carl Perkins' Honey Don't is cheeky and energetic, and remains one of Ringo's strongest vocal appearances. Merit could also be found in the beautiful Mr. Moonlight (excellent vocals by Lennon), in the pretty cover of Buddy Holly's Words Of Love, and to a lesser degree in Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby and the Little Richard medley (which may be one of the best samples we have of how the Beatles must have sounded in concert). <br /> <br />But in their own compositions, Lennon and McCartney really broke new ground on this album, in ways that are subtle but important. It's certainly darker and bleaker than the charming boy-band pop/rock of A Hard Day's Night. The Beatles sound somewhat tired of the superstar status that was at its peak in A Hard Day's Night; it shows in the cover photo beyond a doubt that the Beatles were no longer that interested in being cute. It shows in the slight and subtle sarcasm in the album's title. And it shows in the songs much more. Of the latter day albums, Beatles For Sale best resembles the White Album - there's none of the flower power of 1967 here, but there is some of the bitterness and world weariness of 1968. It shows best of all in John's I'm A Loser, which is one of the best compositions and vocal performances from the pre-1965 Beatles. In spite of the rather traditional rockabilly tune, the self-loathing and depression in the lyrics cannot be ignored; and the lyrics are by far deeper and better than anything Lennon had written before. <br /> <br />Baby's In Black is another great one; this song is interesting musically too, with a six-eighths beat that was rare in rock n' roll in those days. The lyrics are also excellent; even if Lennon's poetry still focused on love and relationships, he was now dealing with relationships much more complex and realistic than the boy meets girl, boy loses girl of the first three albums. Paul on the other hand hands in the beautiful ballad I'll Follow the Sun, which is not quite as catchy as And I Love Her but it's much more daring in its minimalism and intimacy, and sounds entirely sincere. I Don't Want ToSpoil The Party, What You're Doing and No Reply all deal with rejection and depression in a more mature manner than ever before, even if the music isn't quite as complex and mature as the 1966-1967 work. And even the cutesy single Eight Days a Week is well-worth a listen, with its terrific fade-in intro that had since became a classic, and with the upbeat music and lyrics that serve as contrast for the rest of the album. <br /> <br />Beatles For Sale is by no means a place to start your Beatles collection, but it's a good step along the way, and for experienced listeners - many of whom have long ago rejected the earlier albums in favor of the post-Help! material, it deserves multiple listening, and with a keener ear. <br /> <br />Oh, and sorry about that lousy pun in the title - couldn't think of anything else to write.

0767821629|5|It's too bad for &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; that it was released so near the release of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and was marketed as a Matrix-like movie. Not only is &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; a  completely different type of movie (it's not an action movie), it's a much  better movie (and this is coming from someone who saw &quot;The  Matrix&quot; three times in theatres). The quality of the writing and  performances is uneven in a few spots, but overall this is a fantastic  movie that will engage you and force you to think (another difference from  &quot;The Matrix&quot;). I would definitely recommend purchasing this  movie, but at the very least rent it!
B008K8X0IS|5|As the title states, this is a specific review of the Collector's Edition set for Season 1. First of all, let me state that I was very ecstatic that I got this product at a great price of $39.99 when Amazon price matched Best Buy's offering. To everyone who got this set at the said price, we are a lucky bunch.<br /><br />The box is made of quality material. It's not just some cardboard box set like other collector's edition. The front cover is soft and feels like it has a cushion. Once you open the box set, you'll see the Dragon egg inside its recess and the Season 1 Digipack. Underneath the season 1 digipack is another blu ray with a sneak preview of the first episode of Season 2. I know that's a bummer but it's better than getting nothing else as an extra.<br /><br />You also get DVDs and digital copy of the first season.<br /><br />The Dragon egg feels very solid. It's a little heavy for such a small egg but it was finely crafted. Great for display in your office or just on your collector's shelves. Overall, this is a great product. If you don't have the first season already, get this.Specially if you find this product going down to $39.99 again. IT's a no-brainer.

0805028846|5|I bought this book for my design class because I wanted to make a pop-up book but had no knowledge about it. I got up to speed pretty quickly by looking at the simple instructions and examples in this book. (I was able to engineer a pretty complicated pop-up in 3 weeks) The book does not go into rotating structures or tab pulling structures. I recommend it for anyone wanting to learn the techniques and mechanism in paper engineering, but not for those who want to copy the designs as-is. (beware: a lot of heart-shaped examples)

B000001G16|5|Richie Sambora is tragically under-appreciated in the music industry.  If you don't believe me, listen to this album you'll wonder why he isn't a household name.  I bought it when it first came out and still listen to it.  His vocals are beyond compare.  I think his voice is his best instrument and that's saying alot since he is an amazing guitar player.  You cannot go wrong with this CD.
B0040UAYI4|5|I am  tired of all the bashing that seems to be associated to this device...Here is the honest truth...I have owned the Frag FX v2 and i must admit that it still does a good job at playing games such as Killzone 2 and 3 and also MW2. I am sure that the Shark by Spitfish is also good but coming from a PC Gamer there is nothing like playing FPS games with Keyboard (Belkin Keypad) and mouse. I swear, all the people who are knocking this has either been just plugging it in and expecting it to work right out the box ( which when properly configured is as close to PC gaming as you can get...i swear) like Spitfish products where you need to only move the dial to get the settings right (you can also download software from there site and reset key presses and sensitivity)but still needs customizations to work right.    But my Kill to death ratio has been getting better and better each night on Killzone 3 that it seems like cheating at times because its just too PC like. I played with the Frag FX and it was good, but i swear nothing like this thing is...and this is coming from a pc gamer to PS3 so my transition has been smooth and i would not lead my fellow gamers down a wrong path. Just give it a try and really look on Penguin United forums, they have alot of help for users looking to get there Eagle Eye's dialed in correctly. And to all the haters out there, don't complain about the Laggy controls, its not the device,we all play from different regions, it's server lag Einstein's    Games tested are Socom 4, Killzone 2-3, MW 2 and Resistance 2 all work GREAT!!! besides playing from hawaii with all the lag, i still hold my own =) BuLLeTCoLeKToR

B009UVWBMA|1|Taylor Swift is at a career peak right now.  She can sell massive quantities of anything with her name on it.  And justifiably so.  She is a prodigous talent.<br /><br />So why gouge her fans with a \\"Deluxe\\" edition like this?  Three \\"bonus\\" tracks for $30, almost 3 times the prices of the original album's 16 tracks.<br /><br />These tactics really burn completists who bought her latest release when it first came out.

For two dollars you really can't go wrong.

0812992784|5|This book was recommended to me by my niece, and I began reading her copy during a visit.  Although she offered to loan her copy to me, I left it behind at the close of our visit and bought my own copy, knowing that I wanted it in my library.  This is an excellent reflection on the obligations of an author to tell his or her truth, the precious value of living in a society that respects the importance of freely exchanged ideas, and the horrible risks of censorship.
B005S9EK5Y|5|The movie is as good as the book.  The opening scene was amazing and just got better thereafter.  I particularly loved seeing Colm Wilkinson play the Bishop after seeing him in the role of Jean Valjean.  Ann Hathaway played a convincing Fontine.  I couldn't believe Sasha Baron Cohen could be serious, but he did justice to the Innkeeper. Music, lyrics and scoring just don't get better!  I loved the movie!

031606792X|5|I thought this book ended as it should. It's hard to please everyone when writing a book, but I thought Meyer did an above average job with completing this series.     It also leaves it open for perhaps more stories over the years...    I think most people will enjoy the final book, but there will always be a few disappointed.

0553801473|5|Books 3 and 4 of the Ice and Fire saga started driving me nuts.  It seemed like endless plots running in circles with minimal progress, and I started feeling like the old Wendy's lady saying &#34;Where's the Beef?&#34;  I am hoping that George is listening to his fans who are NOT interested in another Robert Jordan &#34;Wheel of Time&#34; -like ad-infinitum series.<br /><br />&#34;Dance with Dragons&#34; was much better, and brought back more of the feel of the first 2 books,  I hope that Book 6 delivers as well.
0634022296|5|Exactly what I expected.  I'm a bit of a returning novice and the songs that I recognise, well it helps my working on chord changes and developing the proper strum rhythm and sound, because I know what I think it oughta sound like.  Sound great on my electric and most even better on my acoustic.  I consider it a beginner bit and fun book.  Aside from some Christian rock, some country, some classic rock, and a bit of what I play around with on my own, I spend about 60% of my time trying to move from among the chords in these songs.  Quite worth whatever I paid for it and shipped and received promptly.

B00000J2SP|4|There is only one reason to get this album, and that's \\"Difficult to  Cure,\\" the last track, which is Blackmore and Company doing  Beethoven's 9th. I thought Zubin Mehta did a great job with this, but, take  my word, Beethoven was never this much fun. This album is for die-hard  Blackmore fans. Most of the album is pretty insipid, so don't expect  classic Deep Purple or Rainbow Rising. Get it to hear Beethoven's 9th.One  of the best heavy metal instrumentals ever. Too bad it's on such a dog of  an album.

As other reviewers have noted, this book does seem more geared to setting up an info based business (most of the profiled companies are not info businesses though). This is what Chris knows and does for his business.  However, with a little thought these tips can be given a little spin and put to work for other types of businesses.  There are many worthwhile tips in here for other types of business though, so I do recommend giving it a read.  And keep the notebook ready.

1439190275|4|This book really helped me respect the Atkins diet a little more and not just treat it like another crash diet. I had done Atkins several times in the past and because I did not really understand the diet, I would spend my entire diet in Phase 1....thinking that it was the only way to keep the pounds coming off. This time, I wanted to be more proactive about enjoying the diet and keeping the weight off, so I ordered this book. The main thing that I learned is that moving from phase 1 to phase 2 does not have to slow down your weight loss.  I spent 10 days in phase 1 (induction) - lost 3lbs and after that I moved on to phase 2 (adding back nuts, seeds, beans sweet potatoes) and my weight loss continued in the same way as if I was still in induction (1.5 - 2 lbs per week). Everyone has to find their balance and this book is helping me do that.

B003YBNRHU|5|Fantastic album. Any Doobies fan has to have it! In what sounds sort of like a sequel to \\"Listen to the Music,\\" Tom Johnston declares that \\"now they say that it's [rock and roll] a young man's game, and that's who is burnin' the flame, but they seem to forget who shot the rocket out of the hole.\\" And, \\"I'll tell ya what don't work for me, the crazy ideology that says playin' that rock and roll is just a young man's game.\\" And the Doobies blast that myth with this album, bringing back one of their original hits for an incredible update. Back awhile ago, when the Eagles got back together, they were amazed that they could get back so quickly, that they were better singers and players than back when they were young. It is the same with the Doobies. That they can make great rock and roll is a given. I remember seeing the band in concert many years ago: they just got up and played, and they were an incredibly tight live act. Well, they sure haven't lost anything. In fact, Tom Johnston's voice is better than ever -- he is a bit more restrained without losing the power and punch. Pat Simmons voice has definitely changed, sounding maybe a bit lower in pitch with more vibrato, but it is every bit as good as ever, just maybe a bit different. These guys prove that they can still write, play, and sing and sound to me like they are at the top of their game. They are smart guys, too. Every band needs a John McFee, a guy who can play anything with strings and can add background, drive solos, or anything in between without getting into Pat's or Tom's way when they play lead. And those two guys can still play great guitar. They have pulled in some great musicians, especially Billy Payne with some incredible keyboards and piano.<br /><br />\\"Nobody\\" was one of their first hits, and for this album, John McFee and Pat Simmons wrote a long intro for resonator/slide and acoustic guitar, but it remains a Tom Johnston song. This version is so rich with extra sound and fantastic playing that it is even better than the original. I think that an objective and honest critic, even one who did not especially like the music, would have to say that this band has exceptional playing and singing talent. The return of Ted Templemann as producer seems to have been a great reunion.<br /><br />There are two versions of the album. The Deluxe version has two additional tracks (both of the same quality as the rest of the songs) and a DVD with a way-too-short video of 30 some years of footage and a video of \\"Nobody.\\" I agree with an earlier reviewer that this version, even without the DVD is worthwhile for the two bonus tracks. And the DVD is fun, but it leaves you wanting more footage. Get this album, folks!better than the original.

B001KMB6YG|4|I love this movie.  If you watch this movie as an action-adventure movie, you will be disappointed.  However, if you watch it as a science-fiction movie with religious overtones, you will enjoy it.  I agree that I don't care for the ending.  However, just knowing that he lets go of the anger and bitterness is enough.
B007FG9LIE|5|So after a slew of bad books, that I didn’t finish, this was the first one I couldn’t put down and almost finished on a single round trip to Texas.  This is a great book and goes to show you ideas like what LOST tried to do can actually work if you close out the story and give it some context.  The story line here is a Secret Service agent is in a car accident in a small perfect town called Wayward Pines.  He awakes to find himself bruised from the crash but is having troubles remembering what happened or how he ended up there.  He continues to investigate the town and try and find out what is happening but things are not right and he soon finds himself in more trouble then he should be.<br /><br />Loved this book and highly recommend it.  Great writing and very hard to put down, it’s frustrating to read because you want answers and they eventually come out in the end and in a good way.

1455853100|5|I ordered this on CD to listen to in my car and it's excellent. I highly recommend this for all parents. It's so important to understand how a child's brain works so you can respond appropriately and with compassion and understanding.  Well worth your time, money and a great relationship with your kids.
0307276902|1|James Frey's publisher shows disrespect, even contempt, for readers by publishing A Million Little Pieces as a memoir.  To justify it, she is trying to redefine the whole genre as one in which the author can distort the truth at will if it satisfies some larger narrative goal.  But since Frey originally shopped this book as fiction -- and it was rejected -- she reveals her own cynicism.  Would this book have gotten the attention it did if it were presented as fiction?  I don't think so.
B00LEIT6K2|5|This game is fun, the puzzles have some challenge to them and the graphics are pretty fun to watch.  The speed and interactivity are a bit slow, but otherwise enjoyable to play.
B00003CXXI|3|Shrek got rave reviews over here, and everyone said it was brilliant.  I quite enjoy kids' movies (no blood, guts or horror ^_^) and I enjoyed other CG movies such as the Toy Story films, and Antz.  I also loved the idea of a movie satirising Disney fairy tales!  So I was very keen to see Shrek and had high hopes for it.<BR>Maybe that was the problem.  Because although I wasn't shocked by the movie, I definitely didn't come away bowled over either.  I didn't mind the animation or the music, so what was it?<BR>I don't really know, but having recently seen the movie again, I've come to the conclusion that Shrek has something nasty at its core.  I'm not sure what this is, but I do know that unlike Toy Story, Cats And Dogs or even the Hey Arnold! movie, Shrek leaves a bad taste in my mouth.<BR>Maybe it's the humour, which is either adult or toilet-related.  Okay, that's partly a personal thing (I don't really get on with that sort of humour) but I would have thought that a movie that sets itself up to be a parody would be able to generate humour from satire rather than flatulence jokes.  In fact, I don't feel that the movie was a successful parody at all.  It was more like a Disney story with gross-out humour and a slightly manic/nasty edge to it - that is, the worst of both worlds.<BR>The plot had some holes in it - why exactly did Farquaard arrest the fairy tale characters, and how did they then all end up in the swamp, for instance?  The characters were variable - I found Shrek unlikeable, Donkey was okay but swiftly got annoying, and Fiona was average.  I also didn't like the treatment of Fiona.  Note the way Shrek picks her up and carries her away, humiliating her because she won't do what he wants.  And the way he tries to shut her in the cave!  Also, how can people say the movie shows people can be good and evil, not one or the other?  Farquaard is just as wicked as any Disney villain.  <BR>There are some humorous parts to this movie, and some excitement, and some poignancy.  But it's not half as good as it's said to be, and as a biting satire on Disney movies, it fails miserably.
B008AIGWVA|4|This application is really a cute one and fun to mess around with. and the kidos just love it a lot. I would recommend this to everyone.
B006LSZECO|5|Loved it couldn't put it down! Literally stayed up all night reading it... I sincerely hope the movie does the book justice!
B002UZ5CHO|5|If you are concerned about what is going on with the food we eat this is a must watch!
067144901X|4|All in all a fun little rhyming book about animal sounds but has one doozy of a tongue twister. I get in a good rhythm and all of a sudden comes, \\"rhinoceroses snort and snuff and little dogs say ruff ruff ruff\\".  It's a mouthful, but the illustrations are cute and fun and it's a good story. Enjoy reading it to your little ones, they will love it.
B0007TKH66|5|I'm so sad that this show is leaving us after such a short life. But fear not fans because they will live long in beautiful long lasting DVD. I liked this show from the beginning and thought it was well done, Scott Bakula was a great captain and the rest of the crew was well cast. The early episodes were actually pretty good for a new show and I was quickly impressed. The effects were great and the set design was top notch. I have had this item on pre-order for quite a while now and am eagerly awaiting it's arrival. I've been a fan of Star Trek since I was a little girl watching re-runs on our 13 channel TV and have watched every movie/spin off series that has come around, some were better than others but all were satisfying and carried their own. Maybe there will be a movie in the future, hey one can hope right?
B00CFITJKW|1|no instructions- don't know how it works all flights after the first are locked- maybe they open after you complete the one before but that doesn't seem to be the case. on a scale on one to ten I give it a zero. DON'T BUY IT
B000AGTPUK|2|I have owned the book upon which the movie was based since it was first published. It was in our home before it received the Caldecott Award and I have read it to my baby daughter every year since it was published. She and I hear the bell and we always will. There are few books that compare favorably with this one.      The movie is something else again. The film maintains the general story line of the book while complicating a sweet and engaging story in a manner that is neither necessary nor appropriate. It takes less than ten minutes to read the perfect story and it takes ten times that for the the movie to run. The book never fails to maintain an interest level from start to finish and the movie does not.      Get the book, read it to your baby girl on the evening of December 23, watch her eyes grow wide, read The Night Before Christmas to her on Christmas Eve and again watch her eyes. Listen with her for the ringing of the bell and you will hear it. And, you will see it in her eyes and she will see it in yours.
B00JFKEQBK|5|Very addictive and well designed. Easy to learn, hard to master. You can tell a lot of thought and care went into this puzzle game from the music, animations, etc. It doesn't have the &#34;thrown together&#34; feel that (let's face it) most mobile games suffer from. Well worth the price. You will play for HOURS.
B0001MIQHQ|5|Region #1, you know U.S.A DVD players not Region 2 like you all sent me 3 times before had to return to you all.

6302759110|4|Bram Stoker's Dracula is hands down one of the greatest movies ever, EXCEPT for Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder. Gary Oldman and occasionally Sadie Frost, in my opinion, carry the whole movie from start to finish.  Every scene in this &quot;gothic extravaganza&quot; is seductive and  brilliant except for the scenes that include Keanu Reeves and sometimes the  scenes that include Winona Ryder. Gary Oldman IS the only Dracula that ever  was, ever will be, and ever should be. You know you're watching a good  actor when he can take your breath away despite the not-so-good supporting  actors, and I'm not speaking of Sadie Frost or Anthony Hopkins. I would  have given this amazing film 5 stars, but unfortunately Keanu Reeves had  too many scenes.
B00B7FOQCK|1|Contrary to an answered question I read about this product, it does not support USB 3.0 devices on Windows 8.1. I have Windows 8.1 running on a Surface Pro 2, and tested this product with three(3) different USB 3.0 devices, a Kingston 32 GB thumbdrive, a WD Mybook 4 TB, and a Seagate Mybackup 2 TB external drive. All three were recognized and worked when plugged directly into the single USB 3.0 port on the Surface Pro 2. But when I plugged this port extender in, and then plugged any one of the devices ( one only at a time) into it, none of the devices mounted or were recognized. Even when I restarted the Surface Pro 2 with this product plugged into the USB 3.0 port, same result. It did mount and recognize a USB 2.0 device, but it clearly advertises and states that it is for USB 3.0! Not true, at least with Windows 8.1 on a Surface Pro 2 and my devices, which are pretty vanilla and representative of what you can get.
B00PTB7B34|4|Easy to learn, lots of options and strategy...

B004MPESSY|5|This was a good movie.  Her revenge at the end made it worth sitting through the sick and twisted beginning.
B00785P2QC|4|There should be a way to get credits easier. Don't think you should have to spend real USD for a game when you could program this game to earn credits as you go. Otherwise, it's fun and easy to play.
B005ZOBNOI|3|The book was well written and I continued to read even though I really didn't want to read it.  I don't like to feel sad and I felt at first that I would stop.  I continued and accepted the message. I just like lighter subjects.
B000KJU182|5|My mom really liked it. She has me get a few of these older movies a year for her. Thanks.
B00HCMG6LG|4|A great mind strengthener.  I have yet to get past the 2nd level.  This game will keep you alert and help you pay attention to detail.
0385347774|1|I am so glad that I procrastinated.  I was about to recommend this book to all of my friends, and order more books by this author.  Then something happed that changed my mind: I finished the book.  This is one of the worst endings I have ever read, what a bitter disappointment after an otherwise enjoyable read.<br /><br />Early in the book I could not understand what all the fuss was about.  Okay, I get it, men are pigs.  Then the story took off and there were more twists and turns than a rollercoaster, more surprises than a funhouse.  I could not put the book down and kept telling my wife how good it was, insisting she had to read it.<br /><br />Then the ending.  The author is clearly talented so I can't understand why she couldn't come up with something better than this.  And it's not that I need a happy ending, I mean Hemingway and Steinbeck are two of my favorite authors.  But this was so contrived and unbelievable, and it's like the author went way out of her way to make the ending irritating just so it would stand out.  There are so many unbelievable, inexplicable incongruities that are overlooked because, presumably, the cops bungled the first case so bad that nobody will question anything else going forward.  And we're supposed to believe that Amy is now happy living in this hick town with her hick neighbors just because she now has a \\"Stepford Wives\\" husband?  Please, don't insult us.<br /><br />It feels to me like an ace pitcher blowing a no-hitter in the ninth inning, not because he lacked the ability but because he lost interest and just wanted to go home.  So close to being something really special, spoiled so quickly.  I'm sure the author knows she compromised an otherwise brilliant piece of work just to make it \\"different\\".  If I could say anything to the author it would be:<br />`I feel sorry for you'<br />`Why?'<br />`Because every morning you have to wake up and be you.'  Ha!

0385349947|5|Lean In will become a 'must have' for female executives and entrepreneurs. As a Director in Technology at a Big4 consulting firm, I am often the only woman in the room at my level, and it shouldn't be like that.<br /><br />Most firms, including mine, have a WIT (Women in Technology) group who's purpose it is to attract women into our field and then support them as they grow. We did a study that showed slightly more than half of the entry level associates are women, but that number decreases as you move up the ranks, and then there is a virtual cliff at the Director and Partner level. Books like this can help smooth out that cliff, not just by giving women a book to read that motivates them, but also for men who should, as the book says, consider it a badge of honor to be the sponsor for a female moving up the jungle gym.<br /><br />The best part of this book was the discussion regarding mentorship. It should not be the modern day version of seeking Prince Charming. As a mentor, it can be overwhelming when so many people you don't know well ask you to mentor them, and it can also be overwhelming when your ment-ee has a greater time expectation from you than you are ready to give. Both the mentor and ment-ee should get something out of the relationship - as Sheryl said, if you need to spend an hour a week talking to someone, get a therapist.<br /><br />Again, a great read for both women AND men.
B00992CF6W|5|This game is the best you can also get a app caled pocket inv editor and go crazy with blocksp
B007ZGO7EM|5|this app is great for the kindle fire. The numbers are large enough to touch accurately while shopping. I can easily see the total spent and the last amount added. I really like that I don't lose the total when the screen goes blank.  Much better then a handheld calculator.
B00632HWOG|1|Using a Kindle Fire Hd. Nothing strange or new. A basic email app should work. This one constantly shuts down, accesses the wrong email, doesn't work. At least it SENDS but the older preprogrammed app on my kindle worked much better. If other apps on my device were having similar problems, I'd blame kindle itself. Very few issues. This one constantly malfunctions.<br /><br />Problems: constantly accesses the wrong email even when I click directly on the one I want, shuts down, ADDS ADS. The ad complaint is MAJOR. this is MY email. While I accept that Yahoo provides services and has the right to advertise, I get it everywhere! So far I haven't seen an option for shutting the ads off and due to the screen constantly flickering as the ads are changed and updated, I believe THIS is causing the program slowness that is causing the program to access a different email from the one I am clicking on. If you advertise on your own website, I get it, that's just the nature of internet as it functions today. But I am on my own device on my own email. Get those awful program defeating ads off MY email! I don't look at them anyway, EVER!! I promise yahoo it is only causing my anger against their advertisers. When that happens I personally think negatively about and blackball the advertiser and its products.
B009G41CG2|5|I downloaded Mahjong because I like the game.  The only thing I can think of is, there should be something to click for a &#34;hint&#34;, and maybe a &#34;shuffle.&#34;<br /><br />I play this game very often on my home pc while watching tv, my husband does too, and I have recommended it to others as well.
1595141715|5|Excellent premise, well-executed. There were a few spots where a bit of ambiguity got in the way (main character Hannah, speaking on a tape, leads up to each \\"reason/person\\" by describing the person and events using pronouns \\"he\\" or \\"she\\" or \\"you\\"). The cast of characters is quite large as well, which can be a tad confusing if you're not reading it all in one sitting.    Despite these (VERY) minor issues, Thirteen Reasons Why is a definite page-turner and deserves five stars. Others here have summarized the story well -- I'll just add that Thirteen Reasons Why has a unique premise, sympathetic characters, and a simply amazing intensity that rarely wanes from page one to the last word. A must read that is going on my listmania favorites.
B005MLP71Y|4|To be honest I find Jerry Seinfeld's voice to be a bit annoying (whining), but the clever writing and somewhat in interesting plot overcomes this.<br /><br />I watched this with my 10 year old daughter, it was age appropriate and she giggled throughout.
B00TOMSZCU|5|Really enjoyable and fun!
B00005JKN9|1|This is a film that I regret watching until the finish.  I am the kind who CANNOT stop a movie no matter how bad.  I just have to finish it to see if it will redeem itself.  This did not happen.  I was expecting historical drama mixed with fiction as well as some violence.  But, this was just unnecessarily bloody.  It was obvious that the envelope was being pushed here just to grab response.  I find that's usually required if there is not enough of a storyline to compensate.  The actors did well.  The storyline had so much potential, but too much emphasis on trying to create a &quot;realism&quot; which comes across as just being plain gory and hard.  I thought Bravehart was a gory movie, but good.  This is no Bravehart.
B00005N6KG|3|The description is accurate, these are definitely lightweight headphones. I picked them up for when I am watching videos or listening to music on my computer. The sound quality is good and they are comfortable to wear. My chief complaint is the length of the cord; it is very short and I had to pick up an audio extension cable to prevent the cord from draping across my keyboard during use.
B00000420F|5|Cecilia Bartoli burst upon the music scene with great and well-deserved  fanfare, and this collection of 18th century Italian songs is more evidence  that the acclaim is definitely warranted.  These are beautiful  performances.  The bell-like quality of her voice is enhanced by excellent  enunciation.  It is a joy to sit down and experience this CD.
B0053VKP8S|5|Needed this to convert my TV audio out to a pair of wireless headphones. Easy to install, works great. Best priced unit on the market
B009FZFONO|5|This is one of the best shows on TV right now, the characters plot line and the way the episodes all tie together make the story gripping and leaves you wanting more!
B001O7Y8FQ|5|Pantera is simply amazing and this album was very well priced on amazon. Its a perfect for any metal maniac.
B004MC8CA2|5|I love that I can read any version of the Bible for free! I don't like that my bookmarks are only available when I'm online but that disadvantage is offset by being able to download any version of the Bible for free for reading offline.
B004132HZS|5|I fell in love with the new Sherlock Holmes series from Britain called &#34;Sherlock.&#34;  The characters are well defined and the actors really bring the stories.  My personal favorite for this season is &#34;The Lady in Pink.&#34;
B00827OWO8|4|no
B00BAXFECK|3|Story line was great, but too much description of his drug-induced episodes. The long and wordy passages took away from the flow of the story.
B00HWWUQWQ|5|quick service and found the movie a bit boring.....guess that's what happens when movie makers are more concerned about making money and take a single book to make 2 movies out of
B00L4M2IOE|3|Upon first listening, this feels like one of those Prince albums of the late 90's, when Prince was dumping previously unreleased songs on the public in order to rush to fulfill his contract with Warner Brothers, a company to which he no longer wanted to be obligated. Only it's not Prince, it's Morrissey, and Morrissey has, of late, been having a hard time finding a recording contract. And now we know why.<br /><br />This has to be one of the most uninspired recordings he has ever produced, and this is coming from a fan who has followed this man from his beginnings. I've seen him in concert multiple times, own just about everything he's ever committed to record (&#34;reissue, repackage&#34; et al), and at my advanced age, I still have 2' x 3' framed poster of &#34;Viva Hate&#34; hanging in my home. I am closer to Chicago, but chose to buy tickets to his scheduled show at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, IA, because the novelty of it, and as such, missed him on his last tour, when it was cancelled multiple times due to his struggle with Barrett's Esophagus, a disease that claimed my aunt's life, actually. My point being? Not just a casual fan.<br /><br />There are some bright spots. And because this is a Morrissey album, by &#34;bright&#34; I mean good, not cheery. &#34;The Bullfighter Dies,&#34; is pretty fantastic, and stands out as probably the best of what's here. &#34;Smiler With Knife,&#34; has an eerie tone about it, one which Moz does not delve into often (remember &#34;Jack the Ripper&#34;?), but when he does, he does it expertly.<br /><br />However, the title track is overly preachy, &#34;Kiss Me A Lot,&#34; feels like something that the current teen pop idol should have recorded (maybe the irony is lost on silly old me?), and &#34;Kick the Bride Down the Aisle,&#34; is another exercise in misogyny by Morrissey, one which he feels much too comfortable in doing. I could go on, but the point is, there is more bad than good.<br /><br />If you must try this on yourself to see if you like it, do so with caution. The 18 track extended version is only for those who are into completing their collections, as most of the extra 6 tracks are rubbish. &#34;Julie in the Weeds,&#34; is the only standout here.<br /><br />So if you're new to Morrissey, please start somewhere else. The Smiths &#34;The Queen is Dead,&#34; is a good place, or &#34;Louder Than Bombs,&#34; as it has quite the variety. The aforementioned &#34;Viva Hate,&#34; Morrissey's debut solo album (and still probably his best), would also do you well. 3 Stars from me, but he gets the third only because I'm a long time fan.
0307592839|5|I purchased the audio book version of The Goon Squad, and I have been running to it. I really enjoy Roxana Ortega's reading, as she gives each character a distinctive voice. But skip the chapter where Sasha's daughter reads her power point presentation as it is excruciating in its detail of the pauses between songs, it must work so much better on the written page.
B00CO8D3G4|5|This is a great read, you can laugh, and you can cry, but there is focus to being the caretaker of yourself.
B0070NSPCU|5|There is a reason why everyone has given this book 5 stars. The reason is because this book is fantastic.  It's well written, great character development, a great story, and it's a book you can't put down.  I am lucky to have found another great author. I now eagerly await the next book in the series!  If you enjoy fantasy you will love this book!
B0035LMTZA|5|One of my favorites! I love the action in this movie and the need for revenge! Love Mark Wahlberg & Charlize Theron!
B00005S6K6|5|This is a lovely story about courtly love.  It is quite realistic and both DeNiro and Streep are perfectly cast - in fact, DeNiro says this is his favorite role, because it was a romantic story with Streep.  The DVD is in great shape, and it came quickly.  Thank you!
B00004XONN|5|As a 16 year old rock fan it depresses me sometimes to realize that I have missed the golden age of rock.  But an album like this restores my fading faith in music.  It is intimate/distant piece of art that I hope many radiohead fans will like, sure it's different from their other work, but isn't that why we like them = they evolve, much like The Deftones who have cited radiohead as influences.  all The tracks are great and it's best heard as a whole, with all of your brain soaking it up.
B000FC2L1E|5|im obsessed with the Outlander series! can't put them down!

B0000A7W14|3|Boyz N the Hood is only 3 star worthy for one reason. It's depicting the truth. It's pretty effective at doing that and shows the rough life in the hood. The first 20 minutes are excellent but then it kind of goes to the dogs.  <br />The movie starts off with Tre (Cuba Gooding Junior), having to  leave his mother because of breaking a promise to go live with his father Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne). He meets friends, half brothers, Ricky and Doughboy (Ice Cube). You see as they grow up in some very effective moments. Then it jumps 15 years later...and the movie goes sour. <br /> <br />Later on, we've got these boys all grown up with Tre living a pretty descent life, Doughboy into violence, drugs, alcohol while Ricky is a smart kid and an all pro football player trying to get into USC.  <br />Now there's cussing, violence, the typical you'd expect from a movie this intense but it throws in random humor and just isn't very interesting. It is dealing with a very serious topic but doesn't manage to be effective in delivering a message. The ending is tragic as you'd expect but afterwards...I wasn't impressed by this movie. It was to see that this was the truth..but it just wasn't a good movie. It just drags on and is pretty boring and also just has 15 minutes straights of random and pointless discussions about nothing. besides cussing, and bla bla bla.  <br />It makes an effort but really isn't as good as it could've been which is a shame.
8489367116|5|I have read all the great classics, from crime & punishment to war & peace to gone with the wind, and I was very skeptical when I read the reviews of Shantaram and how people we're calling it a masterpiece. after reading it, I can honestly say that I have never read anything that kept me reading as much as Shantaram did. Shantaram is a literary masterpiece and Roberts is Da Vinci with a pen. I don't believe I will ever read anything that will top this one, I don't think it is even possible. the only writer who might be able to do it is Roberts himself. there probably is not one person alive today that can read this book and say that it didnt make them want to be inside those pages, living the lives of these characters. I give this book 10 stars out of 5.

0385536828|4|McEwan's new book is set in 1972 when a young girl is recruited by MI5 to help find writers who unbeknownst the them will help create works that will support the current views of the government. She is given the dossier of an up and coming novelist, and presents herself to him as working for this elite and noble company, and before long their relationship blossoms and they become lovers. Her life is now a secret and a lie, from her family, her employer, and from the writer, Tom.  McEwan uses his considerable skills to not only tell her story, but also the various stories that Tom is churning out.  And as Serena is left constantly wondering who she should trust, amidst the reality of fact versus fiction both in her life, and on the printed page she so desperately loves, it becomes both funny and  clever to see how the deception will play out.
B00HV8U540|5|This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I thought it was original and refreshing as well.
B001UV4XUQ|4|Love stories have been a staple of film since their beginning. Some are good, some bad and some memorable. But few take an objective look at love seeing both the positive and negative, the fun and the sad. That changes with 500 DAYS OF SUMMER.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Tom Hansen, a wanna be architect now working as a greeting card writer for a small company who finds life for the most part unfulfilling. Early in life, he dreamed of meeting the perfect girl, the right one and discovering true love that would last forever.<br /><br />Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) is a free spirited young woman who's just begun working at the same company Tom works at. Summer is the sort who doesn't believe in true love but in living for the moment.<br /><br />During a meeting at work, Tom sees Summer for the first time. For Tom, its love at first sight. For Summer, it's just another day.<br /><br />The film doesn't follow a linear path, instead jumping from one day to another, for instance day 3 and then to day 344. What we see is the ups and downs of a romance between two young people. But what we get is a look at love, romance and the search for the perfect match.<br /><br />In the early days we are privy to the courtship of Summer by Tom, how he finally gets the nerve to ask her out, how he gets to know her and her getting to know him as well. And as with most romances, the two enjoy each other's company and all of the details that become second nature to them both.<br /><br />But as time progresses, or in this case moves back and forth, we see the change in their relationship. Gone are the small enjoyments in a look, a laugh, a whisper, replaced with finding these same things that were once treasures now annoyances. And yet, they remain together. Until the fateful day when Summer announces she wants to be friends, those killing words to any hope of being a couple.<br /><br />Knowing full well what the result of this relationship will be fairly early on in the film (thus knowing now is not actually a spoiler), what you get rather than the usual beginning to end romance is an offbeat style of film that entertains from start to finish. The movie covers all bases that revolve around being in love and losing love. It's filled with humor and sadness, just like real life.<br /><br />This movie is about dreams of romance. Not just those of the couple we witness on screen but in the dream of romance that everyone searches for in their lifetime. And while some never find it, others do. While some hope for the one to walk into their lives, others find that special someone over time. And this film captures that in its combination of vignettes that come together to form one thoroughly enjoyable movie.<br />What is also a joy is watching the actors in this film. Gordon-Levitt gives a remarkable performance showing a depth he's not had the chance to since he starred in BRICK. Last seen in G.I.JOE as Cobra Commander, he offers a completely different performance here that show his versatility. So much so that after watching I wondered what he would choose to do next?<br /><br />Deschanel has always stood out as an attractive young woman who opts for characters that are a bit out of the norm. She does so once again in this film, offering a free spirit who isn't quite as free as she might think. She conveys the charm of a young woman in love who eventually finds herself in a position of hurting someone she cares for.<br /><br />500 DAYS OF SUMMER was a film that took me by surprise. There were so many different directions it could have gone. Surprisingly enough, it takes them all but not in direct order. And while that might discombobulate some viewers, for those willing to take a chance you will find a movie that entertains and touches your heart.u get rather than the usual beginning to end romance is an offbeat style of film that entertains from start to finish.

B000B8QEZG|5|This cd is not breaking any new ground or blowing the doors off of the dance music genre, but it is a darn fine pop record and insanely addictive. I can't single out a bad track on it! Yeah some of the lyrics are a bit trite but it is leagues better than some of the crap getting airplay right now. (\\"My Humps\\" comes to mind). It won't disappoint longtime fans and certainly should win her some new ones.
B000065V3H|4|And it still works..This is truly one of the best teen films to come out of any decade.It ranks with any of John Hughes' classics,and at times,comes out ahead.Patrick Dempsey turns in a wonderfully sensitive portrayal as zero-turned-hero Ron Miller.This is a not-to-be-missed DVD,So if you think you have 'em all and you don't have this..you don't have 'em all.I AM holding back one star however,since the film is not presented in widescreen.But I'm sure that an anniversary or special edition will be along at some point,right? Don't let that little snag stop you though,own it,own it,own it!
B00008S2VG|2|This CD is totally different. Broken rythms, different lyrics, no consistent good melodies. Bits and pieces thrown in together. If you liked solid tracks on the Ray of Light you will not like this album at all. Wait for nice remixes instead.

B004I744AS|5|The Free Dictionary by Farlex is enjoyable to read everyday. It is challenging and very informative regarding vocabulary, history and current events.
B00001U0DP|5|I went to the movies alone and this was the only movie playing at the time I arrived so I bought a ticket and went in.  It was in english subtitles and the first 5 minutes was slow because they developed the situation.  I truly started to get up and leave.  Then the main character met the woman of his dreams in a very unusual manner (unusual is a word you can use throughout the movie) and everything after riveted me to my seat!  This movie will pierce your heart with ALL the emotions!  YOU WILL laugh out loud, smile, cry, be filled with a sense of foreboding, and at the end sadness and joy simultaneously.  You will CHEER for fatherhood and want to be the best father and husband you can!  If we had in our own lives what this family had in theirs, the world would truly be a great place to live!!! The acting is fabulous, the story is WOW!  I've seen it about 7 or 8 times and will watch it again!  I must stop because I am sure you don't want a 1000 page discertation!  You will ENJOY this EVENT!
0385493622|5|My first Singh book was &#34;Big Bang&#34; which was also excellent. He is phenomenal at weaving a massive story over a period spanning multiple millennium in a few hundred pages. He gives short bios on each major player, and tells interesting stories about their lives. His method keeps you on the edge of your seat, and what others would think would be a boring subject is indeed a page turner!<br /><br />Some of these mathematicians committed suicide, some were killed at an early age (Galois, mathematical genius dead at 20), others had to disguise their gender (Sophie Germain) due to discrimination. It's very interesting to learn about each character.<br /><br />Altogether a highly readable book on a journey to solving Fermat's Last Theorem.<br /><br />I read it in about 3 days (it's 300 pages), and maybe 15 pages discuss math that I don't understand (modular forms and elliptic equations), but it's very minimal and doesn't get in the way. It was mostly about the lives of these mathematicians and their struggles.<br /><br />If you are interested in learning about the lives of Pythagorus, Euclid, Euler, Gauss, Germain, Galois, Wiles, and countless others...Check it out.<br /><br />On a side note I would love it if Simon Singh wrote a book on the history of evolution. He is a master at simplifying very complex subjects.

B006ATJXQW|5|I read the first and second maze runner books before reading this one. It really helped clarify some things knowing the background to the story
0307595579|5|These are really cool books. The clothe covering and design are very clean and nice looking. These are great books to read and this edition would be great just as a collectible. The case is nice and disappears when put on a shelf. I won't write anymore, because I don't like super long reviews.
B00V4JKT52|3|It was just okay. The ending seemed to drag on and on.
B00IIUATDM|1|Although the lead is well done it's a tedious movie way to long with predictable ending. Boring
B008UCJ7KO|4|Wow I can't believe there's going to be another book to this series! I can't wait!  I loved the suspense in this third book.  It kept me wanting more the whole time!
B000I186FW|5|The movie is pretty similar to the book. A few differences in the characters but you still get the same overall theme.
0784011680|5|Love him or leave him, this is Robert Downey, Jr.'s finest performance. He should have won an Oscar for his heartfelt portrayal of the late, great Charlie Chaplin.  I'd never truly known Mr. Chaplin's work or his zest for it until seeing this movie.  It is timeless must-own. Great cast. Rich script.  Grab some popcorn (of the old-fashioned variety), sit back and sink in.
B00AECGQF2|4|This app helps you really tap into your creative side.  Some of the characters have an interesting look but the sounds they make are funny.  Everyone in our house plays this game!
B007THA4FI|5|Casual Vacancy is a slice of British life,  the good and the bad, with lifelike characterization portrayal.  An example of great story telling; taking the death of one individual and creating a world from the ripple effects of that death.  What imagination. A world that is not always pretty.  The story seamlessly draws you in and before you realize, you are caring about everyone.  The subtle underlying  commentary of how the system works ( it could just as easily be set in America) because the story works.<br />A great observation of human nature, thought provoking, lifelike,  this is a realistically slice of life, the type that most people do not want to acknowledge, thus creating the very story.  Beautifully crafted.  A reader is left pondering how J.K Rowling always gets it so right!  As another example of her writing chops I say write on!!!  I look forward to her next book.
B00DUGCLY4|4|This is a Awsome app it's fun and helps pass the Time if I was u  I would get this app
B00DR0PDNE|5|This product is incredibly easy to set up and use. It it the perfect solution for converting an older HDTV into a smart TV. On a side note: I used it in combination with my cell phone to rickroll my wife from across the house while she was watching Twilight. Best Christmas present ever!
0312360266|1|I was disappointed greatly with this book! Let me say that I am a fan of Vampire fiction, and I love teen fiction to death. So I decided I'd rent this book from the library to feed my curiosity. Let me say that while I thought there was lots of potential, I also felt that none of it was used well. It has an interesting concept (Vampire boarding school), despite being unoriginal. And it was executed in the way that was as interesting as watching a toilet flush. THe main character, Zoey, is so terribly Mary Sue. She needs everything to be perfect, she is dating the most popular guy in school, she is rich, etc. SHe complains when something she's not used to comes along, which is annoying. I also found this book to be extremely sexist. Not a single male character is strong at all, they're like mannequins in a clothing store. And almost NOTHING HAPPENS in this until the end, and when it does happen, it lasts two pages. A real disappointment, do skip this book. But then again, it's better than Twilight.

0385512058|5|My boss gave me this book. While I love to read, any book given to you by your boss has some hidden meaning - right? Nope.  He read it and he told me right up front, there is not a reason in the world you can't be doing this stuff.  Look at it and tell me what you think - my boss said.    I got on the plane that night and started reading it. The next morning I read more and took notes. The book was telling EXACTLY how this guy keeps a network going. These were practical tips, small things, not things that took years to do.     Like simple stuff - send a thank you - right after the meeting from your laptop. Don't wait a week. I always waited a week. Then it was too late. I now send thank yous IMMEDIATELY. One idea landed a client because it demonstrated speed and service - that I would write a thank you right away.    There are a ton of ideas. Another is printing your Outlook Contact file for the city you are in and from the cab - call people and tell them \\"Hello\\" on their voice mail of course because no one actually is sitting by the phone. Just saying \\"hello, how are you, etc\\" and expecting nothing in return SHOCKs the listener.    Also - give of yourself. to that end check out a brief overview the book at josephbmurphy . com  AND - MOST IMPORTANTLY - ALWAYS try to help others when they need it. It is a great philosophy.

B000AM4PBS|5|I started becoming a fan of FRIENDS when I picked up a simple one disc Best of Friends Vol 1.  I watch it, and then had to go get the other three that were out.  As soon as the seasons started being sold, I was first in line to buy them, one by one.  So you can imagine the money I have invested in them. <br /> <br />A friend of mine sent me the link to this page this morning and said \\"see what kind of money you could have saved\\".  My reply back to her was, yes I could have saved a ton of money had I waited to buy all 10 seasons at one time, however they have brought so many tears, laughs, and emotions to my life over the past 5 years that I have been a fan that I feel all the money I have invested in  them was worth every single penny!  How I miss the gang every week and feel that they could have continued on, but at least I know whenever I need that \\"dose\\" of FRIENDS, all I have to do is pop in a disc and they are right there with me.

B002752NGA|5|I love the underworld series and cant wait to see the next one. I really hope it will be soon.
B001PR0YDA|5|The movie did an excellent job of balancing the romance and poverty of Victorian London.  The special effects were phenomenal.  The lessons for Scrooge were driven home in both practical and theological ways.  I was very impressed.  The need to drive fear into Scrooge is critical to his transformation, making this inappropriate for easily frightened small children -- I did bring my 4 and 6 year old to see the movie, and it was all right, but I might not do it a second time because the effects were quite potent.  That being said, I would like to see it myself again in 3D.<br /><br />Interestingly, Scrooge does seem to do a lot of falling in the movie...<br /><br />The cinematography and effects call to mind the first Narnia (Lion/Witch/Wardrobe) rendition (Disney).  Truly, it was well done, and I highly recommend it.  I will purchase it when it comes out.
B00009Z574|2|&quot;Tormato&quot; found Yes in the middle of a musical crisis. The English press was praising punk and new wave bands, and bands like Yes were called &quot;dinosaurs&quot;. Maybe because of the new musical climate, Yes abandonned the 15-25 minutes song format and concentrated on shorter songs. But the band was still short on inspiration, as this uneven cd demonstrates. Tracks like &quot;Release Release&quot;, &quot;Onward&quot; and &quot;On The Silent Wings of Freedom&quot; are good, but others like &quot;Circus of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Future Times&quot; or &quot;Madrigal&quot; are just plain boring. The production is quite dry: one wishes the band had hired a producer instead of doing it themselves. &quot;Tormato&quot; is the product of a tired band, going through the motion. It's no surprise Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman left after the tour that followed.
1592401791|5|You have your MP3 player all filled up with Beatles songs?  OK, now you're all set to listen to this entertaining and edifying book by the Beatles main recording engineer - the man responsible for what we actually heard - Geoff Emerick.  So when Emerick tells us that John Lennon wanted \\"to sound like the Dalai Lama\\" on a mountain top in \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" and he achieved that by using rotating speakers, we can go straight to that track and visualize what he did. <br /> <br />In an age when practically anything can be done with computers, this book gives us a refreshing look at 40 years ago when editing was done by literally taking a razor blade to audio tape and sounds were created by running up and down halls with microphones.  Told in a detailed, but not overly-technical style, Emerick takes us through his assistant days and early Beatles tunes  (the jangling fadeout at the end of \\"Hard Day's Night\\" was put in to facilitate the fadein for the next scene in the movie) through his fullest professional years working on Revolver, Sgt. Pepper (the chord that goes on forever at the end of \\"A Day In The Life\\" was created by turning up the record volume as the chord grew quieter - so much so that you can hear the studio air conditioner running in the background), Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine, then the White Album and Abbey Road.   <br /> <br />The book covers some of the Beatles personalities, and that's nice to see, but this isn't a Beatles book per se.  It's more a fun making-of documentary.   <br />
B00DW3GDQW|3|This was not the most enthralling movie I have seen, but it was enjoyable entertainment. I did find the Japanese perspective most interesting, although I cannot attest to its accuracy. This was for me a better movie about Pearl Harbor than the later movie &#34;Pearl Harbor&#34;.
B005K17RU0|3|did not work so well in my area. I was disappointed with the app. would not recommend this too highly.
0385532458|4|This was typical of Grisham.  Good story line.  Not too wordy.  Definitely enjoyable read!

1594202842|4|Amy Chua has ignited an important debate regarding the effects of parental expectations on children's intellectual accomplishments. She makes clear throughout her book that she values success in academics and achievement in classical music over the more mainstream American obsession with social acceptance and popularity. Displaying irony, wit, and humor, Chua admits on nearly every page that she was overzealous at times in her pursuit of excellence for her children. While some readers may view her disapproval of play dates and sleepovers as neurotically strict, I find it understandable since this culture often allows socially dominant children to gain too much power over their peers. Children who have learned self-discipline and intellectual focus may become immune to the influence of the louche, lazy, or obnoxious kids prevalent in many middle and high schools. We have all had enough of the witchy queen bee, the slothful pothead, and the brutal wolfish bully. Whether readers agree or disagree with Chua, her memoir incites them to examine the ways in which parental authority shapes children's values.    While Chua realizes the flaws in her parenting method, she demonstrates far less awareness of the status anxiety and social snobbery that plague many of her attitudes and actions. As a tenured professor at Yale who has written two well-regarded books in her field, she belongs to a cultural elite whose economic and social privileges far exceed those of most Americans. Since she knows these privileges are hard to gain and maintain, she is determined with a vengeance to keep them. One of the ways that she secures her upper class status is by enabling her children to succeed in high cultural pursuits that may be out of reach for those from less privileged backgrounds. In Chua's world, composers such as Bartok, Kodaly, and Prokofiev are status markers as powerful as Yale, Harvard, and Princeton. On the one hand, Chua's love for classical music is evident in her willingness to learn complex scores in order to supervise her daughters' practice sessions. Yet music is also an area in which she exerts a great deal of economic and social clout by securing for Sophia and Lulu distinguished teachers and prestigious venues in Europe as well as in New York City. Chua's status anxiety and snobbery are also hilariously evident in her disdain for the pet rabbits that she considered fat, lazy, and stupid. She made sure that the fancy dogs she eventually acquired came from a breed noted for its beauty, elegance, and preternatural intelligence. Of course, Chua was dead set on helping her Samoyeds maximize their natural cognitive gifts, since in her social context intelligence is the basis of status.    I believe that many readers find Chua annoying because her concern with status fuels their own feelings of social competitiveness. When reading her book, they may begrudgingly wonder if what is good enough for her should be good enough for them. While Americans need to raise the intellectual standards that we set for all of our children, we must also be aware of the extent to which education and the arts are often used as status weapons. Unfortunately, when weak academic standards and undisciplined behavior are cultural norms, intelligence and education become significant social markers for the educated upper middle class. Chua knows this -- if only on an intuitive level -- and she capitalizes on it.

0385537131|5|A Time to Kill was an exceptional book and made me an early Grisham fan; however, I lost interest in his most recent work. I purchased Sycamore Row based on reviews and wasn’t disappointed.  I agree with some other reviewers that it isn’t a true sequel, but a very good read nonetheless.  John Grisham remains one of the best fictional authors of his time.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Flapped wings a game that has birds pipes you could go through and it's fun also there's birds that are different colors.<br />It's really fun and if you haven't played it you should play it.
B001GKJ2FW|5|awesome sing along!
0486275590|5|I knew my 2 kids had not read this book.  This is a classic book that all kids should read at least once. I had a whole collection of classics, Black Beauty, Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, etc. Kids nowadays have no idea what white wash a fence means, lol.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I can't wait to see the movie. This book was good because it wasn't always predictable and I like surprises, sad or not. With a cousin with leukemia, it pulled at my heart strings a little more. I would recommend this book
B004CRR9G0|5|Another great story by Hayao Miyazaki and his team at Ghibli Studio, beautiful art and a message to all the people who see this
B00DRPVE3M|4|Give more tokens on scratch offs... would rate five stars but it's ludicrous to pay for a game  of uno. I don't have any money to be spending on uno...

B002NPY7FE|5|I Loved the movie.
B000002GB9|4|STYX / The Grand Illusion:  STYX was a very good radio friendly band that made a couple of individual albums that are preferable over any `hits' package.  This album is one of those worth owning.  The Grand Illusion has it's share of radio hits, but it works very well as an album.  Four Stars (4 ½)
B009CPJHY4|4|cute  movie wanted to see this before seeing the new one..
B005DOJ68K|5|Not only does this bring back a flood of memories, it is quite frankly one of the only albums with real singing. You can feel it, and it is clear they all felt it as they put it together. You can't help feeling this is very very real when you hear it. It jumps out from everything around it,
B002ZG993Q|2|This movie should air on The Travel Channel.  It's very clean and everything is just so and Clooney keeps getting this very fresh haircut and doing sit-ups and the pseudo-sophisticated ladies will love it and the men will get to see some shooting and there's nice vistas and then it is over.  For a movie star, Clooney has made shockingly few great films, as a leading man or director.  This one is like bad Bullit.  Anton Corbjin makes quiet, good looking, hollow movies that feel like the celeb photog and music video guy he is.
B00A0SJWQU|3|good action and a nice dystopian twist on the original. If you are looking for brain-doritos, a crispy snack with not a whole lot of intrinsic value, this is a good filler.
B003EY7IRC|5|yet another great book in the fever series. I love Mac and Barrons. I can't wait to read the next installment.
B007MB5OCE|5|I loved this book.  In many ways it reminds me of a more advanced complex version of Forrest Gump.  In his advanced age, we find Allan on a journey with a motley crew of people as they bounce around Sweden running from the law.  While this is happening we get flashbacks of Allan's life and get to see his bizarre and often comical stumblings with important events and people throughout the 20th century.  But maybe the most enduring thing from this book is the whimsical and nonchalance that Allan conveys towards everyone and everything during even the most stressful and dangerous moments of his captivating life.
B00FRVH3V6|5|It wasn't as good as it could of been. Quite disappointed in the ending. It could of been better. But oh well.
B00QW8TYWO|5|You should get this games best game ever
0670020745|4|I enjoyed this book tremendously.  I saw the author, Jill Bole Taylor, interviewed on Oprah prior to ordering the book, and was intrigued by her story.  There were a lot of technical references and maybe a little too indepth description of how the neurons connct with each other, etc......, however the life changing information I took from this book, (understanding the effects of positive/negative energy on the patient, knowing I can personally control my thought processes without going through a brain trauma, and the correct approach to someone who has had trauma to their brain)is something I will use for life.  It's definitely a good read for anyone but especially someone who has a dependent relative and/or close friend.  I believe the book speaks for those who are either temporarily or permanently unable to speak for themselves.
B00BSBR9N6|5|Very funny and the characters are familiar; you have at one time or the other ran into people like these.  In fact, you might be one of these characters.
B00BUCXVPI|5|Very good movie, Tom Cruise was great
B0076DELIG|5|With my appetite whetted for Michael Connelly, I picked up the newest Harry Bosch book, The Black Box, and stepped back in time to the LA riots of 1992.  Of course, Connelly was playing on the 20 year anniversary of the riots when the book came out, but he does a stellar job of covering the riots and the racial tensions without making them the focus of the book.  That would have been easy to do, but Connelly is a better writer than that and works out his own riff on those troubling times.<br /><br />The opening pages take the reader back to a young Harry Bosch early in his detective career with Jerry Edgars.  The danger is real and heavy as Harry closes in on the body of a young woman who was discovered shot to death in an alley.  He’s troubled by her there, and by the fact that no one is really going to get to pursue her murderer.<br /><br />I can remember all the uncertainty of those times, though I was living in Oklahoma and not California.  Images that were on the television linger just as much as the recent tornadoes we’ve had in Moore.  Some things that are part of your history will always remain so.  Harry’s motivation to solve that murder feel very real and true to me.<br /><br />The book leaps forward twenty years and the open/unsolved case is one of those that Harry is given at a semi-annual review.  His emotions about the woman’s murder are just as raw now as they were then, and he’s a much better investigator.<br /><br />A chance phone call made ten years ago that was never followed up on leads Harry back into the hunt and he starts digging into the case with a fervor.  With the broad scope of the novel, Connelly also sets up subplots with Harry’s present lover and  his sixteen year old daughter.  I’m a sucker for the father/daughter bits, and I truly loved the gun range set up he takes her on.  I’ve taken my own kids to the gun range to familiarize them with pistols and rifles – mostly so they know to stay away from other kids who don’t know how to handle them.<br /><br />The plot is fairly dense but I figured it out early on.  All the clues are there and Connelly plays fairly with his readers.  Even knowing where we were headed, I enjoyed the ride, enjoyed watching Harry peel back the layers and do everything by the book.<br /><br />The Black Box is a great read, and I have to wonder where Connelly is going to take Bosch next.  There are some loose ends left dangling that I want to see followed through on.t know how to handle them.<br /><br />The plot is fairly dense but I figured it out early on.

B00A0SQBDM|5|nightmares from the deep the cursed heart is a great hidden object game for the whole family to great entertainment
B00JVZ0DQG|5|I really like playing this game
B001GCUO16|5|This movie fills in alot of peices. Action packed, Awesome! It was awesome at the theater and I can't wait to own it on blu-ray disc.
B000000OMB|5|I was fortunate enough to buy the Asia/Alpha double recording on cassette and have listened to it for years with the utmost pleasure.  So now I'm purchasing each separately on CD for better sound quality.  Both are well  worth many great listening hours!
B009UX2YAC|5|I can't figure out why I'm not in Miami love this game and want to complete the weekly challenge but I can't. :(
B0064TVQ5E|5|Love this game
B00NW2KZYY|5|My kid love this its easy for my six year old and fun for my nine year old<br />They have a ball with it
B002O3Z4QQ|5|great miniseries
0060581808|5|Used it for an advanced ESL class, discovered it had tons of word groups:  wood, woods, trunk, branch, root, chop, axe, was one group you'd expect to find reading about life in a forest!  Another was about butchering, preserving food, etc.  It was dense information for my students, I'd rethink presentation next time.  One of my favorite books for it's description and cataloguing of life in the woods.
B000020617|5|This is an awesome album! Learn To Fly is an awesome song. I would reccomend this CD to anyone. I love it.
B001V5CIFI|4|This is an excellent movie and it kept my two grandchildren (6 & 3) interested throughout! Taught them a few valuable lessons as well! Very well done.
B00H1MDH3W|5|Very nice app I would recommend this to alot of people.i like the way it was setup and easy of use.
B008L1DNGI|5|Brilliantly updated for mobile devices! It was a unique puzzle experience when it debuted, and has definitely held up with this port to android, especially with the cleaned up graphics and intuitive mechanics! Once you get used to how tile placement works, it's fast easy and fun!<br /><br />Bottom line: whether you've played it before or not, this is a must-play game that is well worth the price, no matter your age!
B0006L16N8|2|X&Y finds Coldplay reworking their sound, adding sonic filler akin to their idols, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno, Depeche Mode, etc. I hesitate to include Depeche Mode in that list since, save for lead single Speed of Sound, the new album is just a collection of epic songs with no concrete message or purpose, odes to either the majesty or mediocrity of the universe, I can't tell; think Daylight, A Whisper, or Politik without any argument, times ten; there's just no charisma to the album, nothing that would make me play it aside of rainy days or huddling miserably in some odd corner, and certainly nothing even remotely radio-friendly like Depeche Mode. I'm convinced that those fans who listen to this album, who don't worship Radiohead and odd odes to quiet as artistic genius, will yearn badly for the simple, plaintive Coldplay of their past albums. Nothing on this album nearly matches the yearning or contrition of Trouble, Shiver, Sparks, The Scientist, Clocks, Green Eyes, Warning Sign, A Rush of Blood to the Head, Amsterdam, I Ran Away, Crests of Waves, or Moses. <br /> <br />Played live on the MTV live leak show, song A Message showed some promise, but on the album, it and What If, Fix You, and Low ring hollow. Excepting the Johnny Cash folk song 'Til Kingdom Come, which struggles on its own continuing Parachutes' waiting, the other songs all come across as modern day Pink Floyd covers. Read the lyrics to album closer tracks 10, 11 and 12; there's no punch to the gut, or to the face. <br /> <br />Word is that Coldplay dropped everything and started anew while making this album, ala Oasis on Definitely Maybe. Whether or not this contributed to the lyrics being so empty, I don't know, but without the want or misery of their better work, Coldplay is not the same. Contentment suits them badly.
B00I9MS86O|1|The product was wrapped but there was not season 1 and there were two season 4's. WHAT?! Very disappointed!
B004SMDJ9U|4|When I first watched Haven I was underwhelmed by the acting. I thought Emily Rose's character Audrey was stiff and uncomfortable in her role as an FBI agent with a mysterious background. And let's face it, when Eric Balfour is in the cast, you can almost bet that the show will be a loser. However, I kept watching week after week, and believe it or not, I came to like these guys, even Balfour's black sheep bar owner who has a strange tie to Audrey that we don't see until the end of the season.    I think I became a fan in the episode where we see Audrey reach out and touch her partner Nathan on the arm and we realize that he can actually feel it by the subtlest flash of emotion on his face. This is where the show began to interest me. We begin to see that there is more to Audrey than even we know.    These characters all have some huge secrets and we as viewers aren't going to know them all at once. The strange incidents that happen in Haven are directly tied to whats really going on with our main characters.    By the end of the season I was eager to see more of Haven and all it's odd-ball citizens. SyFy does get some things right. This show is one of them.
B006LSZECO|5|Hard to put down!  Clever and fast-paced from beginning to end.  Explores many kinds of relationships - more than just a who-done-it.  Great book club selection.
B00A3NQNUU|5|when i got the update it reset. so i fell like delete the game but ill se if it fixes it self.
0977326403|5|Excellent book and a quick read!
B0054JZC6E|5|101 games +25 is a really fun game where you get to unlock random games. Each game is different in its own way. I would recommend this game to anybody who likes to play games!
B007EECSFA|3|It took a few chapters into the book for the story to capture my interest but when it did  I couldn't put it down. Although it's not a must read novel it is still a treat for us book lovers.
B00Y6QF0PE|4|I truly enjoyed reading the 50 Shades trilogy. I was happy to hear that another selection was now available.  Grey was like rereading the original series. Could have saved the few dollars by opening up what I already owned.
B0077PBPJ6|5|ENJOYED IT.
B00HUCF6KK|1|this show stunk. the only reason people liked it, was because the actors and acting was grade A. the story was slow, boring and it took everything I had to keep watching. If not for the acting, people wouldnt be sucking this shows tits. people need to differentiate between good acting and well written. this series was just boring as all hell. Fargo whips its ass and calls it sally. so should you.
B000OLGCI4|5|Not this video watcher and I'm guessing you couldn't either.   \\"You see it true... someone like me can learn to be human too...\\"  I have always loved this video just as my children enjoy Jungle Book. A great Disney classic for people of all ages. My kids and I dance in the living room with Baloo and King Loui. Breath heavy with Bagheera as he tries to steer Mowgli and Baloo in  a safe direction and shudder a the oh so viscous Sheer Con as he tracks them through the jungle. Don't forget the adorable crooning vultures that are just waiting for something to do... on a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 10 for timeless entertainment and family favorites.
B007GCY8FS|4|As always,Jack is a fun character.  However, the final scenes in the hanger was a little tedious. It also seemed to end rather abruptly.  I look forward to his next adventure.
B00IKZX1ZI|4|I like it.  After seeing the movie though it would have been nice too have objects from the movie in the puzzles<br />to match instead of just a square, circle, diamond, ice-cube, and a house shape.  Reminds me of candy crush<br />without the candy.
B00AKEMHCA|1|This app has malware and it really blows since I just realized I wasted money on a game made by greedy developers who just want to screw over other hardworking individuals. What a shame, this game was actually fun.
1607747308|5|Was a gift for someone else
B008Y768XO|3|Heart warming, but sad tale. Too long and slow for the kids who might enjoy it otherwise.
B00CW6DAKC|1|It shows up in apps. But won't show up with all the other games, when I go to this area to hit install it won't do anything, I've shut my kindle down and turned it back on but won't show up and won't download right. I for some reason am able to play, but doesn't seem I can move things at all after placing them.
B00I6JOBTI|5|Kids love it and the wife & I enjoy it too.  Lots of jokes and fun make it enjoyable the first time and the hundreds of times the kids repeat the viewings.
B00NG6FMOE|5|This woman Miss Whitney Houston is one, if not the greatest of all time. Her songs and her style is beyond compare. So happy I treated myself to this cd/dvd.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Love this game
B0056369RO|5|If you loved their first album, you'll love their new album. Upbeat, fun music that'll keep you shuffling for days. I would definitely go with the deluxe edition, I think you get like five more songs, all of which are good, and its only $2 more. Its some great tunes and makes a half hour drive to work go by in about five minutes.
0385344430|5|My wife and I have been waiting for this 8th in the addition of Diana's work.  it is clear it was a well written book.  The best part we like is the characters are so life like and the history that goes with it.  Now this is how history classes should be given in high school.  Make it come alive.  I had a world history professor in college that did just that.  He even went on trips all over Western Europe in the summer and took photos of the buildings and places that went along with the written history.  This made it come alive and be more real.
0307454541|4|I have to admit, that 1/4 in to the book I wasn't very impressed. Although I could tell that a lot of ground work was being laid, it was a bit of a bore. It all of a sudden seemed that things then ramped up, and I was on a roller-coaster of suspense. The characters of Salander, and Blomkist were very believable, and intelligently written. As soon as I was done the first book, I downloaded the second. I'm sure that you'll do the same!
B00MNYTWMI|2|I don't know if it's just on the Kindle but the game keeps freezing and telling me I need to update. But there is no update available and I have to start over. Three times now.  I really like the game but am disappointed with the result and losing all my progress twice.  Beware.
B000005Z0G|5|2Pac's \\"Strictly 4 my..\\" has to be one of my fav. hip hop albums. What you get with this cd is some of Pac's most agressive, passionate and truest songs ever written. It starts off with the very angry, loud and intense \\"Holla if ya hear me\\", a song that makes you wanna punch someone directly in the face! \\"Point the finga\\" is another aggressive track with a neo-bass and hip hop drum sample behind it. Great track! \\"Last werdz\\" with Cube and Ice T... need i say more?!?! I really like \\"Souljah's revenge\\", one of Pac's angriest tracks. Listen and i'm sure you'll like. Despite the very crude and angry songs, Pac also shows his most emotional and poetic songs on this album aswell. Songs such as the infamous \\"Keep ya head up\\". And one of the most true songs ever written in the history of hip hop & music \\"Papaz song\\", displays the pain someone go's through growing up without a pops. Don't sleep on this album, buy it, listen and gain some knowledge. Rest In Paradise Makaveli.
B002ZG981E|5|This was a good movie. Manipulating dreams. Manipulating your own and even more scary of a thought influencing others thoughts through dreams. Keeps you interested all the way through.
B00BATINVS|3|Well-written, easy to read, learned nothing new.
B001ANYDAO|5|This book delivers exactly as promised on the cover. I finally now have a better understanding as to why it seems Asians are better at Math! This book gives a deeper understanding to what the late Randy Pausch said by &#34;winning the parent lottery&#34; and how it helped shape him into a successful adult. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to understand the whys in life.
B00GOZQ2E8|5|Very fun and entertaining game fun for the whole family. Has great graphics and my kids enjoy all the different aspects of the game
1455521205|5|David Baldacci is one of the most talented writers of his genre in today's market.  His knowledge of the most up-to-date weapons, description of special op training facilities and expertise needed by his characters is interesting and educates the reader.  In 'The Target', his description of life in North Korea is both educational and startling. Baldacci's books are so good, you don't want to put them down until you've finished reading them and you want to start a new one immediately afterwards.  He is a naturally gifted storyteller and creates very interesting characters.
B002MQYOFW|5|This is one of the mysterious books that I have ever read, but the series is not done yet for the final finally.
B00LXLM05I|5|Great game overall
B000003493|4|While more than half of the songs are not what I would label psychedelic, they are good. In fact, every track on this disc is good and that is rare.
B008JGSM6G|5|i play every chance i get
B006LSZECO|5|This was a true page-turner for me.  The first half of the book was nearly impossible to put down.  I thought the storytelling was so inventive, and the use of their marriage/relationship as the backdrop to the mystery just fascinating.
B00SXK8R6S|5|Fun and entertaining. Costuming and sets are done very well.
0143126687|1|This book makes 50 Shades of Grey get a Pulitzer!  Its true what EVERYONE has said.  The characters are flat, stupid, unrelatable, and SHOCKINGLY stereotypical.  Its like the writer never speaks with real people or has REAL dialogue with adults in his own life if he actually thinks people speak this way.  I felt like this was written by a child !  There is not one single redeeming quality about this book.<br /><br />I don't know how it got published in the first place.<br /><br />In the capable hands of any other writer this could have been an intriguing thriller.  Instead, its a poorly written fantasy full of cliche and silly dialogue.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.
B000002L68|5|What can I say about this album? Only that it is one of the best I've ever listened to and had the pleasure to own. It comes very very close to being almost perfect. And I say almost because I don't really like Computer Blue, but even that song isn't bad. <br /> <br />Here, Prince is at his zenith. And even with subsequent great outputs like Sign O The Times, none of his albums eclipse the greatness of Purple Rain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />ie populaire de la bande dessinée et du dessin animé où il a fait ses premières armes. D'abord dessinateur de BD, puis cartooniste chez Van Beuren (1933-1934), Ub Iwerks (1937) et enfin Warner, il signe de nombreux dessins animés, dont Porky Pig dont il est l'un des créateurs. Tashlin est salué par les spécialistes comme un auteur qui révolutionna le cartoon, à l'instar d'un Tex Avery ou d'un Chuck Jones, par son utilisation de procédés purement cinématographiques. En passant derrière la caméra après la guerre, il fait en quelque sorte le chemin inverse en insufflant aux films de prises de vue réelles l'esprit déjanté des dessins animés. <br /> <br />La Blonde et moi est une comédie assez classique dans le fond, une satire gentillette et inoffensive du showbiz et de la culture populaire des 50's. Tashlin s'amuse avec la fabrication des stars, les petites combines pour faire remarquer son poulain, la possibilité de faire un tube sans une once de talent... mais la critique est loin d'être acerbe. Le film se rapproche plus des comédies à la Cukor (le film est tiré d'un roman de Garson Kanin, l'auteur de Madame porte la culotte et Mademoiselle gagne-tout) que des fables mordantes de Billy Wilder. C'est sur la forme qu'il marque une rupture avec la comédie de l'âge d'or, mariant l'esthétique des sitcoms et du cartoon, sur fond de Rock'n Roll et de ses tubes populaires. I love your eyes, I love your lips, they taste even better than potato chips chante Eddie Cochran. Des paroles et des musiques auxquelles le spectateur est encore peu habitué, La Blonde et moi étant l'un des premiers films produit par une Major comportant du Rock'n' Roll. Gene Vincent, Fats Domino, The Platters, Little Richard, The Treniers se partagent l'affiche en autant de saynètes où ils égrainent leurs tubes respectifs, dynamisant, à défaut de dynamiter, le film. Julie London, évoque quant à elle un versant mélancolique et quelque peu sirupeux, avec un Cry Me a River qui hante les virées éthyliques de Tom Ewell. Ces intrusions sont cependant artificiellement plaquées et ne transmettent en aucun cas la fureur et la subversion de cette musique. On ne peut vraiment parler de film Rock'n' Roll, et La Blonde et moi ne demeure au final qu'un documentaire un peu suranné sur cette époque. <br /> <br />L'ouverture est une petite réussite qui porte en elle le programme du film. Tom Ewell se trouve dans un cadre 1.66 en noir et blanc. Promettant au spectateur du grand spectacle, il pousse les côtés du cadre pour atteindre le format du Cinémascope, puis fait appel au \\"Gorgeous, Lifelike Color by De Luxe \\" qui illumine soudainement l'écran de ses couleurs flamboyantes. Il vante ensuite les mérites d'un film où « Culture, refinement, and polite grace of present day music » seront de mise alors que la bande sonore est soudainement saturée par un tube de Rock'n' Roll qui jaillit d'un juke-box. La musique envahit la mécanique et emporte ce grand spectacle classique et de bon goût, dont Tom Ewell exalte les vertus, dans le tourbillon qui s'abat alors sur la culture populaire américaine. Même si le rendez-vous est quelque peu raté, La Blonde et moi demeure une sympathique comédie, témoin des changements radicaux qui vont ébranler les fondations du cinéma hollywoodien qui, en plus de perdre sa mainmise sur le divertissement au profit d'autres médias comme la télévision et la variété, va être considérablement influencé par ceux-ci. <br />
B000LXQVA4|5|Baby loves all of the different sights and sounds this jumperoo makes.
B001NHNG64|3|Worth the read although a bit predictable.  I enjoyed it, even though the slang being used indicates the writer is not American.
B000002B1M|5|The 2nd album from Nasty Nas \\"It Was Written\\" is an underrated but classic album. It is not better than Illmatic, but it is still extremely well written and put together. Comparing this album in and out with Illmatic is stupid, so I won't do it. (Even though lots of people tend to do that with every other Nas album) The storytelling skills of Nas really show on this album, tracks like \\"The Message\\", \\"I Gave You Power\\", \\"The Set Up\\", \\"Suspect\\", and \\"Shootouts\\" are great examples of this. Other notable tracks are \\"Street Dreams\\", \\"Watch Dem Niggas\\", Live Nigga Rap\\", and, of course, the undoubtable classic \\"If I Ruled the World.\\" I highly recommend this album to any fan of hip hop. It's one of Nas' best albums.
B0036S4B6M|4|I downloaded the book after watching the first two seasons of OITNB on Netflix. I was impatient for more, and heard there was a book so I got it. It was very interesting to hear about the reality of prison, without the comic embroidery and larger-than-life characters from the series. I do wish the author had looked harder at herself -- how the experience had changed or not changed her, but overall I would really recommend the book, especially since today about 1% of Americans are in the system -- in prison, on probation or on parole. Important to know just what this means and what we're doing to the women (and men) we lock up.
0152023984|3|This is a children's book?  The author has to make a forced landing in a most inhospitable environment, and his new acquaintance, an alien boy who owns a tiny planet, dies in the end of a snake bite.<br /><br />Adults may find some redeeming quality in this book by realizing their self-induced reduction of the wonder and fantasy about life they had as a child.<br /><br />If one ponders the book more deeply, it shows us that we consider things that we have a personal connection with are more important to us than those we haven't made a connection with.  Awkwardly the author says that the people or things that we have connections with are 'tamed'.  The Little Prince felt strongly for the rose that he owned, but cared not for the many he found.<br /><br />The book has a really twisted ending for a children's book.  An attempt was made to suggest that the Little Prince would astral travel in spirit form to his own planet after allowing himself to be bit by a very poisonous snake.  He reminds the author of his(the Prince's) laughter and suggests that whenever the author looks up at the stars, he remembers the laughter.  This might have been a good ending, but the author 'drew' a sheep for the Little Prince with a muzzle that could fall off.  If the muzzle came off, the Little Prince would be horribly saddened because the sheep could eat his only flower.  This leaves the author in a state of anxiety and the book ends with the statement that no grown-up will understand this story.  I found that to be the case for myself.<br /><br />The one thing that I did enjoy about this book is that the Little Prince always kept on asking the same question until he got an answer.  Interestingly enough though, he seldom answered direct questions himself.<br /><br />This review is of the Katherine Woods translation.<br /><br />3 Stars
B00DJFIMW6|3|my kids and I loved this game at first.  it's super cute and tons of fun to play, but now what is happening to us I see has happened to others - the game won't open.  quite disappointing since we've only had it a few days and the kids want to play.  would give 5 stars if we could actually play again.
B00L2XWHNW|5|As good as or better than &#34;An Awesome Wave&#34;
B00005R1N3|4|I saw this version of this movie for the first time recently in the past year or so, and liked it. And was happy to find out that I could purchase it from amazon.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00GEEB730|4|A lot of laughs, thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00AA7O22U|2|First, I'd like to say that Van Damme portrayed an excellent villain.  I was surprised.  But he never fights.  Why the hell would I want to see Van Damme simply strutting around as a charismatic bad guy?  Fight!!!  Fight Lundgren.  Fight Jet Li.  Fight Terry Crews.  I watch this movie to see legendary match-ups with choreographed brilliance.  In this flop, the great Van Damme fights Stallone at the end for about 2 minutes.  What the hell is that?<br /><br />Lundgren got a chance to shine as a thespian as well, his expressions priceless, BUT . . . who wrote the dialogue to this movie?  The gods of action are forced to spew the stupidest, inane, worthless, pointless phrases!!!!!  It degrades our American action legends!<br /><br />The young sniper is a blatant plot tool.  And he fires a sniper rifle faster than a double-action revolver.  Impossible.  Who advised this film?<br /><br />The guys barely fight all of the goons sent their way.  Instead there is a ton of gunfire.  Spraying and praying.  Why the hell do I want to see these action stars shooting guns the whole damn time?<br /><br />Remember that epic battle between Lundgren and Li in Expendables?  Remember that match between Stone Cold and Stallone?  Nothing like that in this film.  Jet Li is the best in this film, but he is in the film for a couple minutes kicking major butt creatively.  Then he literally jumps out of the film.  Statham has a nice scene as a priest, murdering a few guys.  Terry Crews throws a few goons around creatively.  But there is one villain of note, who never fights any of the other Expendables one-on-one.  What good is that?  Don't you want to see Statham vs. Van Damme?  Don't you want to see Li vs. Van Damme?  They really dropped the ball.  Hey, try paying a few famous MMA guys to be Van Damme's henchman and pit them one on one vs the Expendables!<br /><br />This film has a few exciting violent scenes.  It has too little hand-to-hand combat.  It is a bullet-fest.  If I wanted that, I could watch a million mediocre films with nobody actors.<br /><br />This is a collection of the gods of action, and all we get is a silly shoot-out with impossible shots made.  If I wanted magic, I'd watch Harry Potter.<br /><br />And please do not mention the ridiculous and corny Chuck Norris scenes.  He shows up for NO REASON, rescues them with magic bullet sprays and missile launches out of thin air, has corny music, NEVER FIGHTS ANYONE, and has dialogue that sounds barely more useful than a blast of diarrhea.<br /><br />I am so disappointed with Expendables 2.  I love these stars.  Each one of them.  I respect their skills, and I KNOW they can kick major butt creatively with great spectacle.  Instead, I got a POORLY WRITTEN, plot-less, bore with child-like dialogue.  The actors are obviously trying to be entertaining.  They succeed in their expressions, body language, etc.  But the script gave them a tasty heap of dung to speak and a paper-thin unreasonable plot that nobody cares about.<br /><br />How can these guys come from excellent movies like the Transporter series, the Rambo series, Predator, the Die Hard series, and so on--and YET accept this poorly-written poop-fest with guns???????<br /><br />Imagine Bruce Willis trying to take on Van Damme or a drunken Lundgren?  How cool would that be to see?  Imagine Arnold and Stallone duking it out over some plot twist?  How awesome would that be?  Imagine Jet Li and Statham teaming up vs. a ton of guys.  How about Terry Crews brawling against Van Damme?  How about Chuck Norris fighting his way out of a paper bag, if he still can?<br /><br />We get none of that.  We get a glorified day at the gun range.  So, I swallow my love for these legends, and declare Expendables 2 barely mediocre entertainment.  And it hurts to say that.  The first one is way better than this one.  Van Damme was wasted.  All the talent was wasted.<br /><br />Expendables 3 now looks like a bad fart on the horizon.  I have little hope.could watch a million mediocre films with nobody actors.<br /><br />This is a collection of the gods of action, and all we get is a silly shoot-out with impossible shots made.  If I wanted magic, I'd watch Harry Potter.<br /><br />And please do not mention the ridiculous and corny Chuck Norris scenes.

How cool would that be to see?  Imagine Arnold and Stallone duking it out over some plot twist?  How awesome would that be?  Imagine Jet Li and Statham teaming up vs. a ton of guys.  How about Terry Crews brawling against Van Damme?  How about Chuck Norris fighting his way out of a paper bag, if he still can?<br /><br />We get none of that.  We get a glorified day at the gun range.  So, I swallow my love for these legends, and declare Expendables 2 barely mediocre entertainment.  And it hurts to say that.  The first one is way better than this one.  Van Damme was wasted.  All the talent was wasted.<br /><br />Expendables 3 now looks like a bad fart on the horizon.  I have little hope.
B007SGLZP8|5|This is one of Grisham's best books since the Firm--I couldn't put it down; definitely worth the read; you won't be sorry
B00J2VSS0C|4|Not really sure on the game yet but they want me to give a review
B000MQC9H4|5|Great movie
B006ZCWU5K|5|I waited a long time before buying this CD as Bruce's last several efforts have been poorly produced and have each had only a couple good songs on them. Wrecking Ball has grown on me though. The songs have a passion in them that has been missing since The Rising. This is clearly Bruce's best since The Rising, and might even be better (ranking things like this isn't really sensible).<br /><br />Even though a couple of songs-- Wrecking Ball and Land of Hope & Dreams-- aren't new, this is the first time they have been on an official CD. The opening song is good (now that it's not being overplayed like it was last April) and Jack of all Trades grows on you .
B00BHNQ5XK|5|One of the best horror films I've seen in years. Not one that makes you jump out of your skin every few minutes, but it's more of a mind fu*k. Very eerie. Can't wait for the sequel!
B00BD99JMW|1|The writing style changed completely and poorly, it seemed like she didn't know where to go with it, and the book has the worst trilogy ending EVER!!!! Total tank,  start  to finish!
0345529057|5|still reading them and they are amazing, the books are better than the series but the show does justice as well
B008Y2X78S|5|I loved season 2 of BW Empire. Can't wait to start watching season 3.
B00628SJJS|5|Very awesome family movie
B00B7PIRIE|5|Absolutely recommend. This is one of the best 1914 era series I have watched in a long time. The cast is amazing.
B0074VTHKM|5|I really liked this book and it was a very easy read.  It kept my attention and I had a hard time putting it down.
B00FAX6XQC|5|I enjoy the was it was created so life like And even tho I don't like guns. I enjoy the animation.
B00DR0PDNE|4|Love it. I use it almost everyday to watch Netflix or YouTube. But I want more. I want to be able to extend my monitor with it. I want to be able to cast Amazon prime because let's face it, Netflix is lackluster when it comes to great movies and non-existent when it comes to new release movies. So here are the pros and cons. Once again, I love it but I want more.
B00AEJM6H2|5|Had this on my android phone and is so addictive, so I downloaded it on my kindle to. Love the levels, graphics. Beautiful colors
B00005AFVR|5|Bruce Springsteen is considered by many to be the greatest concert performer in rock history. If someone were to ask me, I'd say it's because, having seen him more than 20 times over the years, Bruce leaves no doubt every night about his belief that his concerts can change people's lives for the better, be it for the duration of the show or longer.<br />I believe this CD captures the essence of a Springsteen concert more than any officially released record to date. By the time I got through &quot;Youngstown&quot; and &quot;Murder Inc.&quot; I was in the same sweat I experienced during the final MSG show. If a concert CD can't reproduce the actual experience, then it's a failure. By that standard alone, however, &quot;Live in NY&quot; succeeds like no CD I've ever heard.<br />Yeah ... you could argue that &quot;Tenth Ave. Freezeout&quot; goes on too long, that the sermons and the band introductions lose something if you're not there. But I've listened to it repeatedly precisely because it does such a wonderful job of capturing the experience.<br />You could certainly argue that the packaging is sloppy -- it's obvious they slapped &quot;Born to Run&quot; at the end of the first CD, which breaks the continuity between &quot;Out in the Street&quot; and &quot;Tenth Avenue Freezeout&quot;, which begins the second CD. But I couldn't care less because the performance is so stirring and the band is so tight that I would have rather it included as an afterthought than not included at all.<br />And yeah ... you could argue that it's too much of a sampler, and that the decision to use some tunes and not others was flawed. I would've voted for &quot;Light of Day&quot; ... but that would mean two sermons on the power of rock 'n roll in the same package. Then people really would have screamed.<br />As for me, I'm not gonna argue about any of this stuff. All I know is I can feel every note, every performance on this CD as though the band was in my living room or as though I was screaming at the top of my lungs at Madison Square Garden. With all due respect to anyone who feels otherwise, I can't imagine being a Springsteen fan and not treasuring it.
B00EF1PKJQ|3|I've heard Sarah Jarosz on a couple different PBS shows, which got me excited over her music.  This CD was OK, but nothing great.  I really wish it had fewer words and more of her playing!  It's enjoyable enough and makes good background music, but I didn't find anything memorable about it.
0770435726|1|This novel is trite, stupidly plotted, has implausible characters, and if you think you'll get to know something about Europe from reading the book, then I'd suggest that you will learn more in Epcot.  What is believable are the bits about the children, the bits about day care in Luxembourg - no wonder, Pavone was a stay-at-home Dad over there for a few years.  And that's it.  The Scottish pimp in Amsterdam? Obscene and pure drivel.  Everyone in Luxembourg eats ham sandwiches all the time - really?  Kate can kill the bad guys in cold blood (and an innocent young mother just because she's in the way), but she can't immediately identify a stalker (Julia)?  Pure rubbish!  I so wanted to like this novel, and now I'm just angry that I believed the positive reviews.  And by the way: Pavone is a journeyman writer who has a long way to go before he can stand on his own.  His prose is incredibly clumsy.  Too bad.

B00FATEJYE|1|Keep trying to download and every time I have the app has me re download on Amazon Fire. WHY am I having this problem?
B00DMCV7K0|5|Kidd's characters are truly human in their attitudes, expressions and feelings. I enjoyed the subtle sense of humor expressed by Handful and admired her tenacity-ability to endure the horrible conditions of her enslavement. Sarah's decision to not travel the female's conventional path was radical even by Quaker standards. Yet Kidd did not make the character of Sarah unbelievable. Her struggle with her long made promise and her determination to have a voice among men was one that most likely took place.<br />Kidd's writing is engrossing and enjoyable.
B007XKEY6Q|5|I have this on my ipod touch and now on my kindle fire! everyone in the world should get this game! 100 stars from me!
1577314808|5|I will not go into details about this book as there are so many good reviews already.  This is a very liberating book.  After reading it, I felt a tons lighter.  I'm talking about the burdens in life.  One thing I like the most is when he touched base on what give's us pain, which according to buddhism, it's the desire the we set to ourselves.... And we need to cut that desire to set us free. There's also the meditation process that he talked about and how to concentrate on the NOW, rather than the past or the future. This Now, will never come again.  Read this book, and it will set you Free!
0452289963|5|[[ASIN:0141027592 A New Earth]]  Sharply clear follow-up to The Power of Now.  Has more detail on how to work on relationships using the PON principles.  Heart-opening (and mind blowing)truth on every page.  This book has the potential to lift the level of consciousnesss of vast numbers of people.
0446577383|2|Just finished The Camel Club and I have to say I felt it was better than his last book by far, though far from his best work.  I enjoyed the read, and it even kept me in suspense for a while wondering who \\"Oliver Stone\\" really was and just how the bad guys were going to pull off their plan.  While the book had it's moments; overall it strained credibility and plausibility just a bit too much to be really enjoyable. <br /> <br />Mr. Baldacci has a thing for the Secret Service; and two of our hero's in this book are agents.  One is on the last leg of his career and the other is a rising star.  Then there is the Camel Club itself and a few \\"love interest\\" women for our hero's thrown in to boot.  Add to that mix one US President, one NIC Intelligence czar (a shadow of Don Rumsfield perhaps?), several government spooks/agents/killers, some Arab terrorists, and even a few North Koreans for good measure; mix with a secret government training facility and you have the makings of a really good book. <br /> <br />Unfortunately it doesn't mix up right.  I still don't know why the North Koreans were even in the book, other than to give our hero's someone to beat up on.  I'll admit the  execution of the terrorists big plot was a bit surprising; I even liked it.  But the sheer implausibility of it is it's biggest strength and weakness all rolled into one.  But I assume we read these books to be entertained so I am ready and willing to \\"go along for the ride\\" even though my good sense rebels against what I'm reading. <br /> <br />Mr. Baldacci's constant political harping, at odds with the current administration to put it mildly, comes off as a bit preachy.  It wasn't the deal-breaker for me as with some other reviewers, but I felt like I was being lectured to and it hurt the book in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Overall I'd say wait for the paperback; definitely not worth the hardback price.
B00AREIAI8|5|This is a really good game and I have a lot of fun with this app<br />I think you should really get this app
B000002J09|4|This is a very good album. I purchased the Complete Studio Recordings and it blew me away. My top Zep albums are Houses Of The Holy and Physical Grafitti, with this not far behind. It's a pleasure to hear four musicians perform great music very well.
B00F35BV64|3|Unimpressed
B00L9B7IKE|4|The storyline was clever. I didn't feel invested emotionally in at character, which left an empty feeling. A good read.
B0010SKUYM|5|I'm someone who values the plot more than the quality of the writing so this gets a five star review. The writing reminds me a bit like a movie; the Rothfuss directs his writing in the same manner a camera person would.
B000VE439Y|5|As advertised

0061537969|5|A very special person lent me this book and I really enjoyed it both for the way the dog thinks and comes to life and for the great message it portrays.  I bought it to share with the right person but now I am thinking of keeping this one and ordering another if and when I meet that person.  This is a great book with a great message for anyone but even more so for a dog lover.  Enzo is a very, very special dog.  This book is really a treasure.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is great u get hooked there just u gotta try it it'S GREAT GREAT
B009ZQJ1G4|2|Let's be clear: I love sci-fi, both high-brow and low-brow, as long as it's semi-creative and has something to say. If you feel similarly, you'll be disappointed by this one. It's interesting only as the film that sold Batman's producers on the idea of Christian Bale as an action star. This film is a predictable, low-quality, poorly-directed rehash of themes that were much better explored elsewhere. Aside from the gun-kata and maybe one semi-creative action scene (the pistol fight at the end), it lacks anything resembling cleverness, surprise, or intellect. Visually, it was made on the cheap, and they've added nothing creative or new to the general idea of a monochrome dystopia. Patronizing to audiences who actually appreciate the genre. Sean Bean is perfect in his role, as is Emily Watson. Shame they both have so, so little screen-time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|I LOVED THIS GAME!  A nice distraction from all the bad news in our other world.  Look forward to the sequels.  Thanks Fireproof Games.

B000002URV|5|This is one of my all-time favorite albums.  I heard the song &quot;Saddness&quot; (track 2) on the radio and just had to have it to skate to.  Except, I didn't know the name of the group who produced it.        It was a year or so later when `94 Gold Medal Olympic Ice Skating champion Oksana Baiul (sp?) skated to this song in a t.v. special, that I finally heard the name of the group that did this awesome song.  Oksana and I had the same idea.<br />    It prooves that this song is full of emotion and great rhythm.  I think the whole CD is aboslutely wonderful.  It's spiritual, it's mystical, it will completely capture your soul.  <br />    The best tracks are 2 (&quot;Saddness&quot;) and 4.<br />     And well, I've been a huge Enigma fan for years now.

0316055433|1|I struggled through this book in hopes it would have some redeeming quality.  Sad to say after reading all 750 pages, it didn't happen.  It has a cast of despicable characters and I consider reading this book a complete waste of my time.<br /><br />Joan
B00418NVMQ|5|This album precedes A Strange Case Of.... and I'm glad it does.  Halestorm was a solid METAL band on par with Skid Row or Motley Crue.  Their latest album is too poppy, too mainstream.  This album captures their talent.  I love a band that can do it live as well as on record.  I would prefer Arjay tone it back a bit.  Okay, you're a GREAT drummer.  Roger.  Got it.  It's not all about you. You're in a BAND.  There are OTHER people on stage, too.  Still, they put on a great show.  Lzzy is great at audience interaction.  I like how she steps back into the shadows and lets Joe take the spotlight during his solos.  She has a rip-roaring voice.  I hope she can keep it up.  I'd hate to see her flame out and wreck her pipes in the manner of Bret Michaels.
B000GFLE1S|5|When I first saw this film, I recognized the two main actors from other movies I have seen.  I thought the movie was unusual and the story unique; and I loved seeing the versatility of the actors.  Most touching for me, however, was the story...people from several different background pulling together to make the group successful...and a boss who cared about the people as much as he did the product!  Bravo, England!

B00005RZV4|3|This album is in my mind severly hampered by its nonsensical omissions.  I was initially disappointed to learn that it would not be a double disc set (which could accomidate the full 100 minute concert), but I understand that that would probably drive down sales, so the &quot;suits&quot; at Nothing wouldn't allow it.  As it is,t he album clocks in at 74 minutes, meaning that an additional 6 minutes of audio could've been included.  Why then are &quot;Pinion&quot; and &quot;La Mer&quot; excluded?  Pinion was crucial to the opening of the Fragility concerts.  As it is, the album starts off with the opening drums of &quot;Terrible Lie,&quot; and you feel a bit like you walked into the concert late.  Now, &quot;La Mer&quot; was one of the most beautiful moments of the Fragility set, and complements &quot;the Great Below.&quot;  I could understand the omission of these tracks had there been a problem with the running time, but both would've easily fit within the available 6 minutes.  I guess the &quot;suits&quot; figured that cutting the running lenght would somehow improve sales.  As with Underworld and Radiohead, once again, the ideal live album has been eluded.<br />Outside of those problems, the album is really quite fantastic.  It features the best mixing I've ever heard on a live album, and it is a true treat to hear Reznor's material performed by a live band, without all the meticulous overdubs, and find it to be equally beautiful/viceral.

0061928356|4|When Kavita goes to an abandoned hut to give birth, she does so hoping against hope that her new baby will be a boy.  Her first baby, a girl, was taken from her by her husband Jasu and never seen again.  In her poor farming village, a girl is a liability, no use in the fields and a drain on the husband's finances.  When the midwife hears Kavita's labor pains, she comes to assist her ... deliver another baby girl.  Kavita makes the midwife promise not to let her husband take the baby, then makes her husband promise to give her one night alone with the baby. She and her sister Rupa make the long, difficult journey to Mumbai to take the baby, whom Kavita named Usha (dawn) to an orphanage.  At least there, Kavita knows her baby will be taken care of; it's the most she can do to keep her safe.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in America, Stanford-educated doctors Somer and Krishnan have been married five years when they have a miscarriage which leads to Somer's diagnosis of early menopause at 31 years old. As she and Krishnan cope with the news, they eventually decide to adopt.  Kris's mother is a patron of the orphanage in Bombay, and they go through the long, involved process which eventually gives them their new baby, now named Asha due to an error in paperwork at the orphanage.<br /><br />This novel spans 20 years and interweaves the stories of Kavita and her family with those of Somer and hers.  I didn't care for Somer at all, she comes across as a sniveler: wishy-washy, weak, and self-pitying, and honestly, if the story had been only about her, I probably wouldn't have wanted to keep reading.  Kavita's story, however, is fascinating.  She is a good woman who suffers through a difficult life and perseveres with hope.  She never gives up on her \\"secret daughter\\", and as she eventually finds herself in the same city as the orphanage, she visits often, looking through the gate in hopes of catching a glimpse of the daughter she loved enough to give up.<br /><br />With glimpses of the lives lived in the slums of India, and of the hardships faced by women living in poverty there, contrasted with the lives of families like Krishnan's well-to-do circle, a much broader appreciation of India as a whole and the strength of it's people are readily found.<br /><br />As Asha's story comes full circle, Somer finally grows up, and as a reader, you feel pride in the woman Asha turns out to be.<br /><br />QUOTES<br /><br />Kavita is anxious, her stomach unsettled.  She holds a protective hand over her swelling abdomen as they approach the clinic.  Outside the door is a placard - SPEND 200 RUPEES NOW AND SAVE 20,000 RUPEES LATER -  a transparent reference to avoiding the wedding dowry associated with a daughter.<br /><br />Somer has no time for the PTA and bake sales.  She has no time for herself.  Her profession no longer defines her, but neither does being a mother.  Both are pieces of her, and yet they don't seem to add up to a whole.  Somer didn't know that having it all, as she always believed she would, would mean feeling like she's falling short everywhere.<br /><br />Asha shudders involuntarily as she looks at this woman who lives in squalor, prostituting herself to survive.

B00J1IQUYM|5|I was expecting something science fictionish, but I got a beautifully written and carefully crafted post-modern (!) novel. What a treat!
B007ZGBZHE|4|This book is as well written and presented as all of Preston & Child's previous works.  It finally explains Pendergast's wife Helen and his charge Constance Green.  Too, it introduces a new female character that the authors feature in their next book.  Also two sons, that the FBI agent didn’t know he had, one good the other not so good.  The only reason I didn’t give this book 5 stars was that I felt that the situation, setting and events in the South American jungle was a little “over-the-top”.  Otherwise, the book was excellent.
B00005JN2Z|4|Excellent! While the true origin of Cruise's character remains somewhat a mystery, it's balanced by the fact that we don't need much to convince us of his personality, or his goals. Meanwhile we learn plenty about Foxx's character and we sympathize with his plight, becoming truly concerned for his well being, and witness to what his character eventually becomes capable of.  <br /> <br />Plenty of suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat and Collateral delivers hearty punches in the action department as well, with great shootouts and hand to hand dirty work. Or should I say hand to neck.  <br /> <br />Well written, well acted and well directed. Collateral gets my vote for one of the top action movies of 2004.
B004XJRQUQ|5|Excellent
B00006EXDM|4|Good
B00LSX4FUO|5|This first novel in Peter May's Lewis Island trilogy is vital to the other two books. You must read it before the others in order to appreciate fully the characters appearing throughout the trilogy. And it is well-worth reading. May is a master of description and plot development. But most of all, I admire his skills in character development. The setting in the Hebrides is picturesque and knowledgeable. I learned a lot of unfamiliar Scot Gaelic words and customs. Great writer and series of novels.
B0021L8V1Q|1|Oh hey, there'll be spoilers. Also, this has been heavily edited from the two paragraph blurb it once was. Now you know.    Iron Man. We saw in the first movie an arrogant, hedonistic, self-absorbed playboy brought low. We saw him build himself back up again into something greater. He was still self-absorbed, arrogant and hedonistic, but now he was less like someone they'd make a reality show after and more like James Bond. He's still going to chase the girl and have a good time doing his job, but he's still the guy who's going to save the world.    On top of that, we had an excellent cast, and they played to their strengths. Jeff Bridges was the most subdued, interesting villain I've seen in a long time. Gwyneth Paltrow played the smart, independent, savvy personal assistant who's not above knocking her boss down a peg when he needs it. Terrence Howard was fantastic as Rhodey. Even John Favreau, the director himself, was amusing as Happy the bodyguard in the scene he had.    Four writers crafted a character story in the guise of an action movie in the superhero genre that wouldn't be seen again until The Dark Knight.    SO WHAT HAPPENED?! Why did the second movie suck?!     Well, Robert Downey Jr. was so impressed with the movie Tropic Thunder that he brought the co-screen writer for that movie to write Iron Man 2. There are some wonderful one-person talents who can write science fiction adventure well (Nicholas Meyer from Star Trek 2 and 6 immediately comes to mind), but unfortunately this guy isn't one of them. And John Favreau, the director, seems to know nothing at all when it comes to directing action scenes; the weakest part of the first movie is the anti-climactic action scene near the end. This combination has led to a watered down movie, where too many things happen too quickly, there are entirely too many characters to focus on, the hype of the upcoming Avengers movie washes away the main story, the action is atrocious, and it's hard to sit through.    Iron Man 2. We finally have the back story out of the way. We finally can get to the action, crafted expertly into a story around Tony Stark becoming the alcoholic danger to himself and others he's known best for. We can finally see Rhodey don his own suit and take up the mantel while Tony puts himself back together...again. We can see Pepper Potts doing her thing, and Happy doing his. Mix it up with the occasional reminder of the Avengers Initiative and you have a movie as worthwhile as the first one. Maybe we'll get a Big Bad as great as Jeff Bridges. And maybe John Favreau will let someone else direct the action after all the criticism he got over the first movie.    We didn't get any of that, did we? We didn't get a great action movie, we got Science Comic Con. A convention? The movie centers around a science convention?! Did we stumble into a sitcom along the way to the theater by accident, because an action movie that costs tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to make shouldn't have the plot of a Simpsons episode.     In the Marvel universe, vibranium is kind of a naturally occurring alloy on Earth, and Tony Stark was a raving alcoholic. In the movie, Tony Stark only has a drinking problem on his birthdays and he's dying unless he invents vibranium. I know where this is going. Tony's dad first invented vibranium and created Captain America's shield with it, so we'll see that tie in for that movie. But in changing this up in the movie universe, we take away the one thing Tony Stark is sort of best known for: he is his own worst enemy. He doesn't have some great inner demon to fight in this movie like he did in the first one, he just has daddy issues that kind of show up when the plot requires.    What happened to the great characters in the first movie? Tony Stark is just annoying, Pepper Potts just dotes, Natasha (Black Widow in the comics) is just kind of there until she gets her action scene. The Avengers Initiative is talked about at a doughnut shop.     Mickey Rouke...remember in the trailers, we're promised what should be an epic game of cat and mouse, or some epic power struggle, between Tony Stark and Ivan Vanko? Ivan, who promises to tear down the good name of Stark? What happened to that? Suddenly he becomes a bit player in his own story? We're barely even introduced to Sam Rockwell's character, yet he gets more attention in the movie?    Sam Rockwell's character manages to be twice as annoying as Tony Stark. That's hard to watch.    Don Cheadle just looks bored through the whole movie. Terrence Howard was so much more enjoyable to watch. And how does this work? He's after the power suit but Tony doesn't want to give it to him. Tony says in the Senate hearing that he and his power suit are one; his chest piece powers the suit, after all. So how does Rhodey get the power suit to even work in the first place if there's nothing to power it? Because if Tony Stark just put an arc reactor in the suit yet meant to test Rhodey...the reasoning just falls apart.    All the elements were there to make a fantastic movie. We even see a lot of these elements get wasted. Tony Stark working to find out the history between his family and Ivan Vanko while he battles his alcoholism. Ivan Vanko setting out to destroy Tony Stark's reputation while he's up to his own scheme. Tony knowing he's having some serious issues, so he willingly gives Rhodey the suit (Rhodey personally of course, not the U.S. government). Rhodey having to become War Machine and learn he may be in over his head as a superhero. Natasha coming as a secret agent to keep tabs on Tony, bugging his house, stealing the plans for building the suit, reporting back to Nick Fury to see if he's ready to be an Avenger. Pepper Potts figuring out what's going on with Natasha and Nick Fury. Hopefully some great action in all the right places.    But no. We got crap. We got a bad movie, with a terrible story and talent terribly wasted. The first Iron Man was a great movie, oneof the top superhero movies in spite of its flaws. Iron Man 2 is a thoughtless popcorn flick. It falls in line with Spider-man 3 as the most disappointing movie I've seen.
B00DA6YEKS|5|I finished the last 200 pages of Words of Radiance yesterday in style, stretched out on the back deck with that massive 1100 page hardcover resting heavily upon my chest. I don't often get to relax like that with a book, so it was nice to have the opportunity to properly enjoy the climax of Brandon Sanderson's latest. The only problem with finishing it like that (or at all) is having to somehow wrap my head around how to approach a review.<br /><br />Well, let's step back for a moment and put things into context. As excited as I was by the book's pending release, and as hard as I lobbed for an advance review copy, I was a bit hesitant about diving in. I thoroughly enjoyed The Way of Kings, and am a big Brandon Sanderson fan in general, but A Memory of Light left me with some concerns. I felt that was a big, bloated book that really struggled from the effort to stretch what Jordan planned as a final novel into a trilogy. As much as I knew that was likely more of a marketing decision than a creative one, I still came away from that book tired, frustrated, and disappointed. Even knowing that Words of Radiance was a personal epic, far closer to Sanderson's heart, I still had to wonder how much of that bloat and padding might be responsible for the book's size.<br /><br />I am delighted (not to mention astonished) to say that is most certainly not the case. Sandserson described Words of Radiance as &#34;an entire trilogy of novels bound together into one volume&#34; and that sums it up perfectly. Yes, an 1100 page novel is massive, but when you approach it as an omnibus edition of three smaller novels, you get a much better sense of just how carefully and tightly plotted the entire thing is. There's a lot going on, but very little in the way of wasted pages, and almost nothing of the narrative bloat I had feared.<br /><br />With all that's going on here, I won't even try to summarize or even touch on all the elements. Instead, I'd like to talk a bit about the pair of characters who lie at the heart of the story - Kaladin and Shallan - and the ripples they cast upon the larger sea of words.<br /><br />As heroes go, Kaladin is appropriately frustrating. It's hard to call him a reluctant hero, but that is (in essence) what he is. Yes, he's an eager soldier, a passionate leader, and proud warrior, but his past is constantly gnawing at him, preventing him from revealing too much of himself. He knows he's a hero at heart, and he longs to embrace that role, but he spends most of the book holding himself back. Rather than be frustrating, however, the ways in which Sanderson explores the internal dilemmas is fascinating. Yes, he still spends a lot of time wallowing in self-pity, but we get to watch as Kaladin's shell begin to show cracks, forcing him to confront those feelings while turning him into a far more well-rounded character than we've known in the past.<br /><br />Even more interesting is the way in which his loyalties are tested, with him honestly struggling between what he knows to be right, and what he wants to be right. His scenes with Shallan add some much-needed levity to his character; the ways in which is awkward sparring with Adolin evolves from mutual mistrust to almost friendship is a key element of the tale; and the finale in which he resolves his conflicted loyalties regarding Dalinar and Elhokar is nothing short of brilliant. I was a bit concerned for a while, when it appeared Sanderson was going to let him off the hook and free him from making the big decision, but when his relationship with Syl is significantly altered, it becomes clear that he is going to have to man up, own up, and suck it up in making the hard choices.<br /><br />Knowing that Shallan would be a main character here had me cringing a bit, as I didn't particularly care for her role in The Way of Kings, but she really steps things up here. She is a character who grows and evolves as well, most significantly through her role as the criminal conspirator, Veil. I wondered how Sanderson would approach her courtship with Adolin, and was pleasantly surprised to see that dance bring out new facets to both characters, making them both far more likable to the reader. As we find out, Shallan clearly has a massive role to play in the fate of the world, one that goes far beyond merely being Jasnah's student. Unlike Kaladin, she's very much an eager hero, anxious to prove herself and fulfill the work that Jasnah, regardless of cost, and that sets up a crucial series of events that really drive the climax into the next volume.<br /><br />Her presence changes the entire tone of the story, and helps to shift not just Dalinar's plans, but the entire plot, pushing things towards the long-simmering conflict we've been waiting to see realized. Although she comes to the plains as an outsider, she quickly immerses herself in her adopted world, insinuating herself into plots far and wide. Admittedly, I was concerned that her role Veil was just a convenient way to bring her up to speed with the politics of the camps but, as we find out towards the end, that role will have significant consequences in the next volume (and possibly beyond). As I mentioned earlier, her scenes with Kaladin are fantastic, and their flight through the chasms, chased by chasmfiend and highstorm alike, marks a turning point for all. She is also responsible for one of the grandest set-pieces in the entire saga to date, but to say much more about that would be to spoil the climax.<br /><br />Aside from the characters, I think what really amazed me here as the way in which Sanderson brings all the threads of the overriding mythology together. Up to this point it's all been hints, suspicions, and contradictory assumptions. We knew about the Spren, the Voidbringers, the Knights Radiant, the Parshendi, the Stormfather, the Shardblades, and so on, but it was never clear just what exactly they were or how they were all connected. The back story to all of that was a challenge, to say the least, but we start getting some answers (and some big answers) here. Clearly, there is still more to be revealed, but what Sanderson offers here is enough 'ah-ha' and 'oh, wow' moments to really flesh out the magic of the tale, and to drive home the true 'epic' nature of the narrative.<br /><br />Upon turning the final page, I was left stunned and in awe by what Brandon Sanderson accomplished with book two of The Stormlight Archive. Not only was Words of Radiance nothing like I'd feared, it was everything I hoped for . . . and far, far more. Sanderson really does take the story to the next level here, offering some satisfying resolutions to several story threads, while spawning (and twisting) new ones beyond its pages. Things happen here - events of consequence - all leading up to a climax that really does resolve the core plot line of this second volume in an incredibly satisfying manner. At the same time, we've only just skimmed the surface, and the final chapters ably demonstrate just how much more story there is to be fully revealed. At over 2100 pages into The Stormlight Archive, we have some clearly defined story arcs resolved, some stories well told, and more yet to be experienced.r, Veil.

B007W8S2MG|5|Short and simple review. For people who enjoyed Persona 3 and persona 4 you will enjoy this ! Persona golden is a RPG game and a remastered version of persona 4 which was release for the ps2 a few years back. Persona golden features many new things which wasn't avaliable in the ps2 version such as an extra character , personas and social links. The persona games takes a crap load of time to complete and has alot of replay value even after finishing it. Overall for people who enjoyed the persona games it is HIGHLY recommended that you pick up this copy ASAP !! and for those who are new to the game or the RPG genre give it a go and I know you wont regret it as there is soooo much to do in this amazing game.
B0024RIMBG|5|Beatiful and enjoyable presentation
B00BT0ZDF2|5|This is a very ambitious film about reincarnation and the first time I watched this move, the complex manner in which is moves backwards and forwards in time threw me off, because I was focused on the physical aspects of the characters.<br /><br />However, after watching the Hunger Games films I asked myself a simple question.  &#34;If I do reincarnate, is this the kind of future I want to reincarnate in?&#34;<br /><br />With that, I returned to Cloud Atlas, but this time I took a step back to see the characters differently.  Instead of focusing on their physical aspects, I saw them for how they are portrayed.  Souls evolving through multiple lifetimes and that's when the brilliance of this film shone through.<br /><br />This film makes you look at life, love and the struggle of a species through the prism of multiple time frames and dimensions. No doubt, it is well ahead of it's time.  Then again, what is time?  Watch the film and you'll see.
B000RPTQ1C|5|Love it from start to finish. The variety present on this album is what really draws me in - just when I thought Coldplay had settled on a sound, they released this, which incorporates shoegaze (Sleep Chant), Middle Eastern (the strings on Yes), newage (Reign of Love), ambient (Life in Technicolor) and all kinds of other influences into the new songs. Thank you, Brian Eno and Jon Hopkins, for the ambient flourishes. Also, thank you, Arcade Fire, for providing inspiration for some of the tracks.    My favorites thus far:  Viva La Vida - the \\"Roman cavalry choirs\\" line is so striking and evocative.  Lovers in Japan - when he sings \\"to see what I'm AAALLL about\\" might be my favorite single Coldplay moment, ever.  Reign of Love - pay attention to this one. It tends to get lost in between the heavier tracks but this is the understated beauty of the album.  Chinese Sleep Chant - I love Ulrich Schnauss/Hammock/nu-shoegaze and this taps into that vein quite well. Something a little different for Coldplay. Very dreamy and ethereal.  Violet Hill - such a driving and strong track!  Lost - the underlying \\"shaky\\" drum rhythm is very unique.    I also love all the historical Europe imagery - cathedrals, choirs, castles, kings. I'm sure they are metaphors for our current political situation but they still paint a fantastic and very visual picture. The anti-political songs are cliché by now but Coldplay are taking a new approach to it and I can appreciate that.    Just a great album. Can't wait to see them in August!
B0051ANPZQ|5|It's definitely a book for kids in grade school, as well as parents, there are topics that we should all be discussing with our kids to prep them for the real world. School is such a microcosm. A teacher, much beloved once said that to our class and I never truly understood until now, in retrospect. We see only that which we are exposed. Our environment and people, but taken outside of our comfort zone, what next? Choose kind. I adore the precepts, and the Julian chapter is required reading. That made everything come together. Well done, R.J. Palacio. This is definitely one of my favorite books of all time.

B0001ZX0OW|4|Eastwood is using a particular directing method here that will not appeal to everyone. The method he is using is masterful and unique, and you probably have to have some sort of film or theatre background to truly appreciate it. It's called naturalism, and there ain't no bells and whistles in naturalism, folks. That's because you don't need any bells and whistles to communicate a story of such natural narrative force as &quot;Mystic River&quot;.<br />Eastwood does the only thing a truly talented and knowledgable director could do with this forceful story -- he stands back and lets it happen. Those looking to be hit over the head with Spielbergian emoting and Schwarzeneggerian posturing will need to look elsewhere. In other words -- subtlety, not Hollywood explosions/special effects and bombastic acting, is the key in this film.<br />This style of directing worked well in &quot;Unforgiven&quot; and it works doubly-well in &quot;Mystic River&quot;.<br />The only complaint I have with this film (this is the reason I gave it 4, not 5, stars) is the silly &quot;wife who won't talk&quot; moments in the film. Now, we can't really fault Eastwood, because he got these bits straight out of Lehane's book, but really, the bits came off as artsy and should have been cut. Also, the actress' makeup was badly done and that should have been fixed by a makeup artist.<br />That very minor complaint aside, this is a marvelous film. Buy this movie, and step back and watch a naturalistic masterpiece unfold.
B008UCJ7KO|5|I amazingly enjoyable read. I was surprised that I didn't want to put any of her books down. They are a fantasy that we'd all like to live in.

B0082RHRHC|5|After watching a more Jane Eyre movie, and reading a teen biography of Charlotte Bronte's life, I was curious to re-read  the book.  I found it totally delightful.  I was intrigued by some of the vocabulary (like &#34;unclose the door&#34; and &#34;confabulation&#34;), and thought the movie did a decent although abridged version of the book.  I hadn't remembered there being as much spiritual content in the book as I found and enjoyed the depth of Charlotte's and thus Jane's convictions -- moral, ethical, and religious.  Another interesting aspect was her end compassionate treatment of the characters that other books would have left as the characters to hate and scorn.  Perhaps having read the biography &#34;Girl with a Pen&#34; enhanced my enjoyment of &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; for I found shadows of Charlotte as I read.
B007VI4TKQ|5|Great movie!

I realize you can buy this product anywhere - but if you don't have Amazon Prime and need an item in your cart to go over the $ to get free shipping I recommend picking this up.  The special features on the Bluray are adequate - but I mainly bought this because I enjoy the movie!

0385507755|1|As a former drug addict,clean 28 years, and former Director of an Internationally and well reputed and highly accredited Drug rehab Womens Program , I feel personally manipulated and dismayed by the recent events surrounding the James Frey book and slippery 'memoir genre' controversy. <br />From the Larry King kid glove interview ( Time Warner parented, as is the book publisher and movie rights purchaser) to the Oprah Winfrey 'tie it up, we've got a rep to protect, make it pretty and move on' closing statement and endorsement. This interview was so staged it was insulting. ( and really folks, did you believe for one minute that Oprah was on hold until the end of the interview because of a busy signal???) <br />One of the first commandments to a successful recovery is learning to shed your past skin and work on becomming honest with yourself and others. No embellished war stories allowed. Period. <br /> No embellishments for the sake of making your past seem tougher and badder because that stuff is not supposed to be important anymore, unless of course you wish to continue being the ' giant of your dreams\\" and the \\" dwarf of your fears\\".  <br />James's need to embellish for the sake of story telling seriously discounts his current credibility and his message as a recovering drug addict and alchoholic speaking to other recovering addicts and alchoholics. And does insult to people like myself who have accomplished enough years under our belt to be authoritive in this matter. <br />My own experiences are left in the past and will remain there, thank you very much, but if they reared their ugly heads they, by comparison, would make James Frey's recount ( even the embellished version) seem that of an overindulged, spoiled, party boy weekend warrior addressing the Hamptons cocktail circuit where AA meetings are a place to see and be seen and entering treatment is always conveniently scheduled during the dreary winter months.  <br />Though I ,like everyone, else enjoyed hiscontemporary Haiku and Soho-esque Spillane approach to his story and personally relate to the not for me 12 step approach and writings of the Dalai Lama, I repeatly wondered how he was able to remember so much and with such detail, given that those periods are usually such a blurr as many of us know.  <br />Now I know his formula. <br />I don't want my money back but would have preferred the straight deal from the begining. <br />Shame on you James. And ..shame on you Oprah, for falling for the old 'rope-a- dope', flimsy 18 to 432 page, fiction vs. fact equation. <br />That's like saying \\" Ma , I only snorted 1 line and there were 8 lines of coke on the table.( though I'm an ex addict not an ace mathematician) <br />I hope I'm wrong, but I think James Frey is having trouble with his perception of being succesful in his recovery and that he , his mother and Oprah Winfrey wake up and take notice and  <br />rethink the message they are sending to those people who are now in trouble and contemplating the hard and painful road to recovery. <br />Those of us who have hit bottom, and recovered, have.

1476770395|2|Nothing happened.  I read, and read... and read.  And still, nothing happened.<br /><br />The narrator / main character keeps talking about how Jacobs is his 'nemesis' so I assumed SOMETHING would happen.  But it doesn't.  In the final pages, 'Something' happens, but it's such a terribly quick, thrown-together mess, that it doesn't make the other 95% of the book worth the read. Even at the end, I'm left thinking 'but, was the bad guy even bad? or do we just assume he is because we were told he was?'<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars, because I read the whole thing.  So the talent is there somewhere, I guess.<br /><br />I don't understand how anyone could give this a good review.  If it were a short story, it could have been good.  But hundreds of pages of in-depth character development that do nothing for the overall plot.  such a waste of time.
B00MBVLCLW|5|Excellent, wish I could afford his concerts.
6304080921|4|This is one of the most intense visual experiences of the '90's, with Gilliam fusing medieval and futuristic imagery to form a frightening vision  of all time merged into one terrifying present.  This is one of Willis'  best performances, one that should be well noted before some critic  dismisses him yet again as just another action-movie hero.  Willis  practically bleeds humanity as the unwilling prophet of doom.  He captures  that rarest quality, one that most actors can't do--humility.  David Morse  is quietly chilling as the angel of death.  If the film has one flaw, it's  the lack of comedy that infuses most Gilliam films.  As I get older, I need  a little humor to accompany my apocalyptic despair.  This one *will* give  you nightmares.
0060589469|5|I recommend this book and seller to everyone interested in Robert Pirsig.<br />Great, interesting, valuable, priceless experience, great author. Enjoy!

1592400876|3|Lynne Truss has created a book that provides entertaining reading to an audience of persons who find the rules of punctuation and the oddities therein fascinating. Therein lie the strengths and the weaknesses of the book. For persons who have an interest in the topic, the book, to steal a line from the musical Mary Poppins, helps the medicine go down in a most delightful way. A person reading the book can read the rules of punctuation and actually be entertained rather than bored stiff, and there is much to praise in that. <br /> <br />That having been said, now comes the down side, which must be addressed none the less. Many people are blissfully ignorant of the rules of punctuation and couldn't care less, and this book will not enrich their lives very much. For those persons who are lukewarm on the topic, this book is not likely to convert a lot of these persons as it lacks an index, an absolute necessity to be useful as a reference, which is most likely how the newly enlightened will want to see the book. In truth, I thought that while it is indeed wonderful to see so many of the rules nicely spelled out in the book, the fact that there is no easy and quick way to access them without thumbing through the entire book to hunt for them is a major drawback for any person who really wants to use this book as a resource for instructing others. <br /> <br />This book came recommended to me by someone who suggested it as a means of getting a refresher course in punctuation as it is commonly taught today as opposed to the way it was taught in the Sixties. I did learn a few minor differences from the book, and for that, I am grateful. However, that still doesn't excuse Lynne Truss for making a mistake in the title of her book! A stickler should be consistent throughout!

B00BIR381W|5|If you love Pretty Little Liars, then I would definitely recommend this product. Each season gets better and better. The plot twists even more in the third season. I have no regrets about purchasing this product. It's definitely worth it. If you have not ever seen Pretty Little Liars, then I recommend purchasing the first two seasons as well. You will not regret it.<br /><br />Note that it is also cheaper to purchase this product on Amazon than it is in the stores.

B004SYP5WC|5|I already bought this last year and started to use it. It is a pretty good app that is basic and simple, not too complicated to where it is a hassle just to input things. I still have the app but it became much easier to use the Pageonce and Mint apps. Using the apps where you input your credit cards and bank info is neater because you get emails that tell you when the bill is due or even when theres a big transaction charged. Like having a private secretary that says hey, heads up, you forgot to pay a bill. Plus with those I get pretty good updates as whats in my bank accounts, every transaction for up to like a month, there is almost nothing you need to go to the computer for, even paying some bills, if you have the apps sync with your bill paying companies and banks.<br /><br />But this is is good, I have to say that, if you really are against the Pageonce kind of apps and dont trust financial management apps. You can not compare it to financial management apps because this app is not what those other apps are, it is totally a differnt way to help you get bill reminders.<br /><br />Whether it is worth $2.99 can only be decided depending on how often you will use this app or soley depend on it versus used as a adjunct app to a financial management app like Pageonce of Mint. But definitely it is worth getting for free as the free app to play around with it to see if you have use for it.
B0019NG73G|5|This was an awesome version of the orginal.  The battle scenes were more realistic and the bayonet charge down little round top felt as though I was somehow running down that hill side with the men from Maine.  The extra scenes showing the beginning of the battle put more understanding of the importance to stop and hold the high ground for the Union Army.  I highly recommend this version to anyone interested in the Battle that turned the Civil War.
B0002OERI0|5|Of course it worths 5stars,or even more!no question about that!American idiot is great,and holiday,St.Jimmy,She's a rebel,letterbomb and all the others!!!!And they are so well organized that I just think the album is perfect.GGGGGRRRREEEEEAAAAATTTTTT!!!!!!
B007L3BMGA|5|I read a review of this book before I bought it which I found to be very true... You will either love this story or hate it!!! I LOVED IT!!!!<br />The book isn't just about sex... although that part of it didn't spoil it... the development of the relationship between Cristian and Ana captures you in a way that makes you want to buy all three of the books just to see what happens. It could also be a life lesson in that learning to communicate with your partner can improve the relationship beyond your imagining!<br />Thankyou to E.L. James for a wonderful and fascinating story, which I will enjoy reading again and again.
B00A3Z384M|5|Michael Keaton plays both Batman and Bruce Wayne magnificently.
B00FKF0F3C|1|I'd not recommend this book to anyone. I read first two books of the trilogy but this third was a disaster.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I am a casual game player, so the amount of help that is given works well for me. It's keeping my interest for sure.
B001V7UXG2|5|This is a great series,  good cast, well written!  If you liked Fry and Laurie in Black Adder,  you'll like these.
B009CPES4I|5|Only an indie movie of this quality could be so good that it has a sequel. Great cast - you can't really beat Judy Dench, Maggie Smith, etc. - beautiful scenery and a compelling story. Makes you feel like your life can just start at retirement. Yes, it is a bit of a feel-good movie, but it also has its sad/touching moments.
B00N1JQ2UO|5|Great acting, loved the humor and the action was there. I am a fan of these movies without a doubt.
B00C7TAF3Y|4|Really like the challenges.  Lots of puzzles to solve.  Keeps you thinking.  This is played on a Kindle Fire, first edition.  Takes a half an hour to download.  When trying to open, it eventually goes to the carousal.  Finally got to the game.  When the first level is done and continue is clicked, takes me back to the carousal again.  Finally hard booted and was able to continue.  When you quit and come back, I have to keep hard booting to get the game to continue.  So, great game,  minus a star for length of time to download and for game to load.
B0002LMLSQ|5|Newest favorite cd.  Played during Thanksgiving dinner and received many compliments on it.  Good balance of mood... Bring nice ambiance to the entertaining space.

B000ATQYT2|5|Kermit the Frog has to be one of the most-recognized celebrities of our time; this 50th anniversary edition of A CHRISTMAS CAROL continues his dominance! What a wonderful movie this is - great for the whole family. It sticks to Dickens' original version as closely as you'd expect the Muppets to. :D Don't hesitate: for a wonderful family tradition, purchase this video and watch every Christmas!

B0036BK6MW|4|good movie
B000002P74|5|The album opens with the legendary 'Sweet Home Alabama' [sweet home alabama , where the skies are so blue]- a genius piece by Ronnie Van Zant. The following song 'I need You' takes the rhythm down, i do not like its position in the playlist. Don't Ask Me No Questions and Workin For Mca rock. Mca is the new label of the band. The Ballad Of Curtis Loew is about a white haired black man who has recently died. Swamp Music is a rocker. The Needle And The Spoon tells about the damages of the drug addiction. Call Me The Breeze is a J.J.Cale cover.This last song is my favorite.  <br /> <br />
B000F0UV0E|5|My husband has not listened to ANY music since college days.  I bought him this CD for Father's Day, and he has already worn out copy #1 and now he is on #2.   <br /> <br />This CD WILL become a classic.  The collaboration of two of music's best story tellers and musicial artists is simply brilliant.  It goes down like fine wine...smooth, earthy and very complex.  Mark is an unparalleled song writer and Emmylou sounds like an angel. <br /> <br />There is a bit of everything on this CD.  Rock, Blues, Country and Folk.  If I had to pick out favorites, it would be the last two tracks...\\"All the Road Running\\" and \\"If This Is Goodbye\\".   <br /> <br />So much music that we are force fed on radio by programmers and music executives is...simply...wretched.  We hear what THEY want us to hear.  Finally we have an album with lyrics that actually make sense and tell a story and music that is beautifully crafted....all in one package. <br />
B0064MPXFA|4|Love this
B008RJ6TTC|5|Love, Love, Loved everything Columbo.  I've loved it since I was a child and that was back when it was part of the Friday night mystery series on NBC (now that was when there were only three major networks and PBS).  It's funny but you can watch technology advance through this program....but again I love this series and enjoy the quality of the dvd's..  .

B00992CF6W|4|It's a good game just that hunger games crashes a lot
B002IYEQR4|5|One of the greatest stories ever told! The book really spoke to me on multiple levels. So the ultimate cut blue ray is just a great effort by a film maker to be respectful of the source material. Really pulled it off!
B007SSEZNA|3|I thought that this was a lame newer version and the acting of Gwyneth sucked. The male actor was much more convincing. This was an alright watch but compared to the previous older version it is not worth a repeat watch, recommending or buying. Sorry. Our family will stick to the old version.
B00005JOFQ|5|This is a movie that needed to be made. It was just the right vehicle with which to go mainstream with a gay love story.<br /><br />It starts in 1963, when Ennis and Jack spend the summer as sheepherders (not cowboys, although Jack also does rodeos) on Brokeback Mountain. In a scene that seemed completely authentic to someone with no personal experience of homosexuality but plenty experience in sexuality, they end up making love one night in their tent. And we have to say making love, not having sex. There is real feeling here along with the masculine horseplay. Thus begins a loving friendship that lasts over 20 years, mostly on \\"fishing trips\\" and other camping adventures away from wives and prying eyes.<br /><br />Remember this starts in 1963, long before the word \\"gay\\" had been developed as a healthy way to describe male homosexuality. They had a lot nastier terms in those days. And Ennis remembers when he was a child, his Daddy took him and his brother to view the remains of a man who had been mutilated and killed for being one of a couple of men who lived together. Understand this: he did NOT happen upon the corpse accidentally; his daddy took him to see it. As Ennis said, he probably was one of the people that did it.<br /><br />So naturally they want no one to know about their relationship. Thus the movie explores some of the hazards of closets.<br /><br />OK, no spoilers here. But you definitely do not have to be gay, or even bi, to appreciate this movie. That is exactly what's so valuable about it. Even straights can have real sympathy for the two close friends, likable guys, who look the part, but just don't quite fit the stereotype of the he-man of the western mountains, the rodeo and the ranch.
B001P59V5Y|5|You definitely won't be dissappointed.  Probably the best of all of the Monty Python movies (except maybe Meaning of Life).
B00GINENG0|5|Awesome!My little sister love this game.She is in love with this game!

6305750750|3|You can't tell a story with CGI alone.  Basically, what I'm saying is that SW:EpI had too much CGI effects and characters.  To tell an effective story, or film for that matter, needs good character development.  Even the  CGI characters got poor character development in this flick.<br />One could  not tell whether Darth Siduous was Sen. Palpatine in disguise or not.  You  couldn't get close to Qui-Gon for there was no history to him, just like  there was with Obi-wan in SW:EpIV, until he came back as &quot;force  apparitions&quot; in subsequent films that is.  Maybe that has yet to be  seen in Ep. II or III.  Even Darth Maul, the &quot;new&quot; villian had  minimal screentime.  <br />The only character that we could get close to was  Obi-wan, Yoda and Anikin, however there still wasn't strong enough  character development in this film along to give it that  &quot;stand-alone&quot; quality that the original trilogy gave.  Even you  knew what Lando Calrissian was all about at the end of  &quot;Empire&quot;.<br />I've only seen Ep.I once, so maybe my perception of  the film isn't as good for someone that's seen it multiple times.  Maybe my  perception will change once my Widescreen Box-set arrives on my front door  sometime next week.
B00003CXRM|5|My husband's favorite movie. I bought this for a Christmas gift & he is really happy with it. (Maybe it will grow on me over time??)

B000027822|5|I had never heard of Miles Davis before and then I went and got this CD for a test run on my new SACD player and was blown away with the sound quality that it put out you can hear ever pin drum and music sound I've never been so relaxed in my life. I usually listen to the Beatles and Rolling Stones on Hybrid CD's but this just blows it away. I can't wait to listen a second time. But buyers beware this is the real thing, an SACD not the Hybrid CD that can be played on both regular and SACD players.

1451626096|3|It's nearly impossible to write this review without mentioning the forthcoming TV series The White Queen (currently airing in the UK on BBC1, premiering in the U.S. August 10 on Starz). So, let's start by discussing that elephant in the room. Like many fans of Philippa Gregory's novels, I was elated when I heard that her novels The White Queen, The Red Queen and The Kingmaker's Daughter were being adapted into a series by the BBC/Starz. With the recent popularity of Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones, dramatizing the infamous War of the Roses was a no brainer. Of course, I wasn't too happy when I heard that it would air in the UK first (which means, of course, dodging much of the Internet for spoilers) -and I was even more concerned when I starting peaking at some of the reviews from the UK press. For the most part -not positive, and the shows seems to be tanking in the ratings, but regardless I still want to see what the show's all about.<br /><br />Okay, now that we're past that...time to move on to the issue at hand: Gregory's newest novel in the Cousins' War series, The White Princess. The White Princess tells the story of Elizabeth Woodville's (The White Queen's) daughter Elizabeth of York, who was forced to marry the Lancasterian heir, Henry Tudor (Henry VII) to help end decades of British civil war. Elizabeth, of course, is still reeling from the death of her lover, Richard III (and uncle, I might add), and isn't too happy about being forced into the bed of Richard's murdered. And, of course, her marriage isn't enough to completely quell the war, and with enemies around every corner, Elizabeth must protect herself from all threats -even those closest to her.<br /><br />I really hate to say it, but I thought that White Princess was the weakest of Gregory's Cousins' War novels so far. It's hard to put my finger on it exactly, but it seems like things kind of went into autopilot here. The book really felt like it should have been edited down more. It is the longest book in the series, and so much of it is repetitive -Henry must quash yet another rebellion, yet another \\"boy\\" claiming to be one of the supposedly-dead \\"princes in the tower,\\" Elizabeth's own mother continues to conspire against Henry Tudor and Elizabeth herself. It really seems like we could have skipped over the ump-teenth rebellion.<br /><br />But, on top of the repetition and somewhat poor editing, the biggest thing that bothered me was the depiction of Elizabeth of York. To put it bluntly -she was pretty darn boring and seemed more than dimwitted about all of the politics swirling around her. Sure, I'll bet it was tough being married to the enemy and having a mother that wanted to stab your husband in the back, but Elizabeth didn't seem to know the first thing about playing the game and was little more than a boring pawn. Compared to the other ladies that Gregory has featured, Elizabeth of York was the queen of \\"I don't know's\\" and dimwitted-ness. She doesn't seem to have any of the strength or intelligence of the other ladies and comes across as dull in comparison.<br /><br />As a dedicated Philippa Gregory fan, I really wanted to like this book more, but it just wasn't to be. I can only hope that the next (and final) Cousins' War novel will be better.
B0000DZ3EA|5|The cover photo inside of Peter Gabriel holding his balding head as if he is perplexed perfectly captures my feelings about this career retrospective. Peter Gabriel changes musical styles almost as often as most folks change their socks; he absorbs whatever musical area has lately caught his fancy and incorporates it into his own unique songwriting. Hit provides a superior overview of his career to date and includes a number of tracks not collected on a PG disc before. But Hit isn't definitive by any stretch of the imagination; it focuses on--surprise--his hit singles and key album tracks from most of his albums starting with Peter Gabriel 3 (aka Melt). While that was the album that helped him breakthrough to a new audience, it wasn't the start of his solo career and, as such, this collection gives short shift to two key recordings that helped set the stage for more musical invention.<br />The new track (which was originally intended for \\"Up\\" but dropped at the last minute)is a terrific slice of classic PG. Co-written with Karl Wallinger from World Party, it's superior to much of the material that ended up on the last album. The first CD closes with the acoustic re-recording of Here Comes the Flood which debuted on 16 Golden Greats. No unusual choices here and much of Hit is found on Shaking The Tree. The remastering sounds great. There's absolutely nothing from Gabriel's second solo album which is a pity.<br />The second disc Miss focuses more on the album tracks (many of which received radio airplay but weren't released as singles).  The real gems here for long time fans are the tunes Downside Up and Lovetown. Downside Up is a live recording of the song from OVO and Lovetown originally appeared on the soundtrack to Philadelphia. There's also a taste from his soundtrack Rabbit-Proof Fence (Cloudless) as well. Many of these tracks, though also appeared on 16 Golden Greats. It should also be noted that some of the tracks here are edited versions.<br />What's missing are--for me--two of the best tracks on 16 Golden Greats. The remix of I Have The Touch (originally a B-Side for a single)and Shaking the Tree. With so much overlap, I'm really surprised that Gabriel didn't throw in more surprises. His last 4 albums are pretty well represented here. The Tower That Ate People and Father, Son are two fairly strong tracks from Gabriel's Ovo CD (which never got an offical US release).<br /> Hit is a pretty comprehensive collection even if Gabriel chose to skip Peter Gabriel 2 (aka Scratch)entirely when compiling this set. As to why his second album is missing--it's pretty well known that he felt the sessions were rushed and he wasn't happy with the finished product compared to his first and third albums.<br />I'd recommend Hit for fans who wish to have the soundtrack contribution included here and the live recording of Downside Up as well as Burn You Up, Burn You Down. These 3 tracks along with the key tracks from Ovo make this worthwhile for fans although this probably could have been pared down to a single disc focusing on those tracks and key singles/album tracks from Gabriel's other albums not included on Shaking The Tree.are--for me--two of the best tracks on 16 Golden Greats.

6305127646|5|What an amazing film. My favorite with Val Kilmer. Val Kilmer takes on so many personas as the film dicatates for in this role and does an amazing job in each one.  This film gave me an \\"aha\\" moment with what a skill acting is and how in everyday life we all play multiple roles and when good at it with a purpose can create a desired outcome.  The movie is light and fun.  Just the right amount of action, romance, and humor.  A great find for both men and women who usually struggle with the battle over \\"Terminator\\" vs. \\"Pride and Predjudice\\".  Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

B00007BH5C|5|I cannot say much more than has already been said; nevertheless, this is an absolutely magnificent score (to an equally magnificent film).  Howard Shore has done a beautiful thing by composing the music to Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's masterpiece.  The theme for Rohan is bittersweetly noble, and \\"Forth Eorlingas\\" is one of the most passionate compositions I have heard in quite some time - my heart stirs every time I hear it.  The entire soundtrack is a masterpiece on its own - it is truly difficult to choose just a few select tracks to praise.<br />Overall, this is a gorgeous soundtrack, one everyone should own.  No bland repetition or copycatting here - Shore has captured the spirit of the films AND books.
B004132HZS|5|This series is fantastic. The DVD's are nice too. I love that it has the original pilot on there. You should take a look at it.
B00BMKDTNC|4|A great finish to an outstanding series. Very enjoyable from the first book to the last. I highly recommend this series.
B001MEJY8W|5|Martyrs is an exceptionally violent, gory, gruesome and emotionaly charged movie that would leave you searching for answers behind its premise long after it's over.<br /><br />Let's start with this question - what causes one to question the meaning of life? Is it the joy of living, the fear of suffering, or the anxiety caused by the fear of death? I didn't ask these questions before I sat down to watch Martyrs, but I walked away with them.<br /><br />The movie starts with a scene of escape. We witness a seriously hurt girl running out of a very shady warehouse in The-middle-of-nowhere, France. The girl is semi nude, barefoot, very scared and very hurt. Yet it isn't so much the disturbing image she portrays, but her cries of desperation that draw our attention. Just this scene is enough to lock its self into one's mind and cycle in search of its meaning, but the director doesn't allow us the time to think. During the next few minutes, we are exposed to a quick run through years of the girl growing in a home for abandoned children. We see her attempt to make friends with other and her emotional struggles to cope with a secret locked deep in her mind. We can only dares to image what it may be.<br /><br />Then the movie takes a sharp turn into the dark alley of the unexplained. And this is why I'm writing a review for this movie and not for one that bores its viewers with the first 15 minutes. The turn is so sharp that I found myself glued to the screen until its final scene despite the abundance of brutality and violence.<br /><br />Over the next 30 minutes, viewers witness the shocking murders of a four-person family. This is where we meet the girl again except she is now grown up. And rather than seeing her well adjusted in life, we see her carrying a double barrel shotgun blasting away what appeared four innocent people. The director doesn't spare the viewers the ugliness of a murder. One can almost imagine what the students of Columbine must have felt when the two insane individuals blasted their way throughout the school.<br /><br />But there is a reason behind the senseless killings. Later we discover that the mother and father were the torturers from the girl's past. And if viewers can find some justification for the gruesome killings, it soon diminishes as we discover the girl's depth of psychological disturbance. We see her slash her own body and tear at her own skin as if possessed by an unseen forse. Except we can see the force, an image of a twisted human shape (this one worse than the one in The Ring).  At that point the only way the director can bring us back to sanity is through the eyes of the only sane character in the entire movie. A friend arrives at the scense, a compassionate and courageous girl who shines with her devotion to help the lost. Her compassion is contagious, yet devastating as it becomes the leading cause of her own demise.<br /><br />A lot more can be said about this movie, but I'll leave it with this: Martyrs' is unique in that it actually has an encoded meaning in the suffering of its characters. This meaning is partially revealed in the last sentence of the movie, when viewers uncover what remains after death arrives. You have to discover for yourself what the movie really means.<br /><br />Highest grade for acting, exceptional characterization and twisted premise.

B007IXWKUK|5|I was hooked on the first book after the first few chapters. I read all three books within a week, I couldn't put them down! I highly recommend these books to any romance lover! I look forward to the next books in Christians' point of view!
B006BAEQB2|5|I really love the way each of the women is portrayed so specific to their character. I learn so much about the history of that period. Love it.
B008Y5NO5G|5|Love this movie and have since I was a teenager. They just make 'm like this anymore. Tried to watch dirty dancing 2: Havana nights and it was awful! Poor acting and poor storyline. Loved all the extra trivia the prime version included while watching. Made it fun.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Only one huge problem region 4 glitches and won't play messes up my kindle bad don't know what to do tried everything something is wrong with region 4 help
B000EQ47GS|5|Great remaster job on this album. A remastered rendition of this in a dvd would not be a bad idea.
B003XF1XOQ|4|This was probably my least favorite book of the series.  I got the impression that Collins was tired of the characters and just wanted to be done. I was disappointed because I absolutely loved the first, but felt the series went downhill.
B00RVC3YKI|2|Too long. Not that interesting.
B001BANK32|5|Cool cool v cool v cool cool nice nice cool cool v good v nice v nice nice cool cool. Nice nice. Cool cool.
B00BEZTMFY|5|I absolutely love this movie. I can't even say how many times I've watched it since it came out. It is fantastic. Very excited to see more.
B00008AY3L|4|Its almost not fair to have to compare this record to the rest of Ben Harper's body of work, because he has set such a high standard with his 1st four studio releases.  The record starts out on a very high note as Ben sings \\"I can change the world, with my own two hands\\" as he carries the torch for Bob Marley on \\"With My Own Two Hands\\".  From there we are treated to a dazzling mix of Folk, Reggae, Funk, Rock, Soul, Blues & Gospel.  What's amazing about Harper is he can pull off all these styles without sounding the least bit pretentious.  However if there is a weakness on this record its the uptempo rock stuff, \\"So High, So Low\\" being a near miss at best.  Likewise, the funk stuff succeeds slightly but it doesn't really inspire. While DOTI isn't one of Harper's stronger efforts (again, his standard is very high), songs like \\"With My Own Two Hands\\", \\"Diamonds On The Indside\\", \\"Touch From Your Lust\\" & \\"Amen Omen\\" make this a worthwhile affair and are sure to go down as BH classics...
B00FXMECS6|5|This one definitely trumps the first movie.  Easily.  The rapport between the characters is interesting and funny.  The action is different and a lot of fun.  There a quite a few thrills and twists that keep the story rolling.  Of course, the acting is superb.  You cannot get a better cast than this.<br /><br />If you want a film with heart, with punch, with a sense of humor, you HAVE to see this.  Better yet, buy it.  It is worth it.
B00005JN7O|5|Writer-director Kerry Conran's debut feature \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is both an amazing-looking modern technological feat and a darn entertaining throwback to old Hollywood serials. It's got so much in it that's cool to look at, first of all. And the plot, story and characters have so much pluck that the film wins you over.<br /><br />Thank goodness someone had the sense to finally make a live-action movie about giant killer robots invading New York. I was afraid they wouldn't make one in my lifetime.<br /><br />The story is told in old Hollywood comic-book style, where the hero always cares about his wacky sidekick way more than his girlfriend. The heroine's hair and makeup is always flawless - even though she's escaped from the giant robots, traveled across the globe (and underwater!) in her ex-boyfriend's plane, gotten trapped in a radioactive mine filled with dynamite AND tried to get the biggest scoop in her career as a reporter.<br /><br />Jude Law plays Joe Sullivan, also known as Sky Captain, the flying ace who heads his own private air battalion intent on protecting the world. Law gives Joe enough attitude and goofy charm to come off as a clean-shaven Errol Flynn in this movie.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow, in the funniest and perhaps trickiest role in the movie, plays Polly Perkins, a reporter for the New York Observer who's not above putting her own life (but never her camera) at risk while tracking down an evil madman's plot to destroy the world. Polly, who's either brilliant or dumb-as-a-post depending upon the situation she's in, is also completely self-serving and manipulative. She whines too much, bugs Sky Captain too much, flirts too obviously and doesn't listen to anything anyone has to say. Because of this - and because she's following in the footsteps of her female-heroine ancestors like Fay Wray, her character is HILARIOUS.<br /><br />Many people might have a problem with Polly for this same reason. But, as Paltrow plays her, she's more than just face-value irritating. Paltrow plays her intentionally without irony, short of winking at the camera much of the time, but the joke of Polly Perkins and the running gag of her camera comes through in spades in the film.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie shows up briefly, but her part in the film is key. And her biggest scene provides the film with a great moment that had me and others applauding in the theater.<br /><br />As for the computer effects, they're awesome - even if they're at times obviously fake. That's partly the point, for the effects in the movies \\"Sky Captain\\" is paying homage to did the same thing. Still, the sepia-toned look of the entire film is a marvel.<br /><br />The movie just sweeps you up in its glee, and there are cliffhangers every 10 minutes - the likes of which I haven't seen since \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\" \\"Sky Captain\\" has mild language, good laughs and would work for the whole family.<br /><br />It's a very fun trip. I loved this movie.more than just face-value irritating.

B00D7Z4GQY|4|Good read at the beach.  Characters are interesting and well developed.  I would probably read books by this author again.
B00936A0RU|5|Another one of those films that you need to watch more than once.  This is the story of three brothers, two romances, and moonshine business during Prohibition, with incredibly interesting work of a stellar ensemble cast.  The details that the actors--especially Tom Hardy and Jessica Chastain--place into their portrayals of the characters absolutely make the film.  Totally enjoyable.  Hardy placing his hat onto the bar as he is about to give his younger brother a lesson in holding respect--sublime.  His communication of control in another \\"hat\\" scene with Jessica's character--that he does it, and how he does it, with all due deliberate care--is just delicious.  And Jason Clarke--the oldest brother--'s reaction was perfect.  The tiny details, the postures and slight but clearly communicative body shiftings to convey volumes about family understanding, and the manipulation of fear and control in what is nothing less than a local war...were masterful.  Many small bits of dialogue that can be interpreted in different ways...this is the writer and director's beautiful realization of art that pulls you back in, again and again, to experience and to contemplate the moments and details of life that make it endlessly interesting if you just attend.    Highly recommend.
B0001YRVN4|2|A genius may create love and nurture a masterpiece, but in the end his obsession with it may destroy the very essence of his creation ... <br /> <br />Having been a die hard Star Wars fan all my life and a great admirer of George Lucas, today I will be his harshest critic, as a child who watched in awe and as an adult who appreciated the deeper sentiments of the character driven epic ... I did the unthinkable today, having watched the DVD release of the trilogy ... I PUT IT BACK IN ITS BOX AND INTO THE STORE ROOM... I do not wish to acknowledge the fact that it was ever made or existed, for me the special edition release of the trilogy is the accepted pure unadulterated, uncontaminated \\"TRUE\\" version. <br /> <br />Today George Lucas has become the very corporate entity he once hated, meddling with his own films, cutting splicing adding and deleting unnecessarily in very much the same manner as the studio executives did with his earlier films. <br /> <br />For a product that has been in development this long, even a newcomer to the DVD edition of the trilogy will pick up on huge editing and post production faults, take for example episode 4 \\"A new hope\\", notice how the film skips frames at certain points, or the lack of color correction and the green bounding boxes around the Tie Fighters in the fight sequence when the Falcon is escaping the death star, The escape pod lying on the desert in the first scene where the chroma key blue color has not been removed, or the fact that there is a scene in which Vader finishes his sentence early and then continues to move his hands about mouthing something to governor Tarkin when the sound track is silent, or maybe the annoying yellow smudges of color whenever the light sabers clash. <br /> <br />Disastrously poor production quality control aside, classical elements which all star wars fans have always loved have been heavy handedly altered without any reason, remember that beautiful music score as the attack on the death starbegins, which is the high point holding the entire sequence together ... anchoring the emotions the rebels are going through .... ITS ALL GONE ... muted so low that you can barely hear it, instead all you get is all the sound effects of laser bangs and whirls ... perhaps it is to do with politics between the two departments or whatever. <br /> <br />George Lucas once said that the only thing exceeding his expectations on the original production was that of the musical score ... today he has succeeded in diluting even that. <br /> <br />If he ever reads this I would like to say to him, Star Wars belongs as much to you as it does to the millions of fans who loved it and made the phenomenon it is today, you have taken a pure undiluted work of art and corrupted it to the point where, it people like me walk away feeling that we have been cheated. Please for the films sake realize that people loved and accepted it the day you released each of the films, you have created your masterpiece now just let it go ... step back and let us enjoy it the way it is, not the way your creative department thinks it ought to be. <br /> <br />
B008M36EEI|3|A little slow but a good movie with humor and a good plot.

B00I2WNYJW|5|Capital in the Twenty-First Century is Thomas Piketty's magnum opus about the future of capitalism and the implications thereof. It is by far and away the best book I've read this year, and I doubt if I'll read a better book in this decade. It's a combination of economics, political economy, history, literature analysis (of Jane Austen and Honore Balzac no less) and big-data analysis that had me getting up early to read it. In my younger days, I would have devoured this book non-stop in a matter of days, ignoring food, sleep, and work. It is more exciting than any combination of science fiction novels, and in many ways fulfills the idea of economics as psychohistory.<br /><br />The central premise of the book is the inequality r &#62; g. Through human history, while growth rates have usually been around 1%, the return on capital has usually been around 5% (in real terms, not nominal terms). You might question this 5% number as contradicting Bernstein's 2% number. Note that Bernstein's numbers includes major catastrophes, such as the world wars wiping out most assets in Europe. From a personal finance point of view, such events usually mean that you care a lot more about staying alive than your portfolio! The implications on wealth accumulation is fairly straightforward: if you can accumulate capital such that you can live on less than 5% over a long period of time, you can reinvest the remainder of your capital income and grow well above the growth rate of the economy, leaving you not only with increasing assets, but also freeing you and your heirs from ever having to work for an income ever again. In the extreme case (let's say you're Bill Gates), you can live on 0.01% of your income from capital and essentially reinvest all the proceeds, creating dynastic level wealth. The Hiltons, Kennedys, Rockefellers, and Kochs are of course in this category.<br /><br />Wait a minute, you say, isn't the world GDP growth more than 3%? Isn't China growing at 7-8%? This is wherehistorical data comes in. Piketty provides convincing evidence that these numbers can only occur because of (1) population growth, and (2) catchup with the modern economies. In other words, Europe could only grow at 6-8% a year until it caught up with the USA at the frontier of technology and infrastructure, at which point it devolved down to 1-1.5% growth. The same happened to Japan, and will happen to China. It's reasonable to expect the world to degenerate to that case eventually, but the developed world is already there.<br /><br />Even more impressively, Piketty has current data. This data in particular, shows that the top 1% in Europe and USA already own more than 70% of the capital assets in their respective economic arenas. Even worse, there's reasonable evidence that because of the existence of tax havens, these estimates are low. Piketty analyzes total capital known to be in existence, and reveals that the world owes more money than exists in developed country accounts. The remainder of the dark capital exists in tax havens and is likely to be around 10% of global wealth.<br /><br />How bad can things get? Here, Piketty turns to history for data and to literature to make it real. This section of the book is impressive and amazing to read. During the Gilded Age (called Belle Epoque in the book), the wealthy commanded 90% of the capital in their respective countries. Fully half of the population (then and now) owned essentially nothing or had a negative net-worth, and there was no middle class. There was effectively no inflation, which explained why Austen and Balzac would provide numbers in terms of income for the characters in their novels and expect readers to understand what situations each character was in. Worse, there was no way for anyone to get ahead by hard work or education: even judges could at most make 5 to 7 times the average income, compared to the wealthy heirs and heiresses who would have 30 to 60 times the average income from the capital they inherited. Hence, the plots of those novels always involved marrying someone so wealthy that they could provide a dignified existence (meaning that they could hire enough servants to take care of the needs of daily living, given the non-existence of refrigeration, cars, etc).<br /><br />Lest you think that this state of affairs could only occur because of a stagnant technology, Piketty reminds the reader that automobiles, steam engines, etc. were all invented during this period. It was hardly a period of stagnation. Yet because all new technology required capital, the inventors didn't make off with the lion's share of the profits.<br /><br />So how did the situation change? Was it the progressive income tax? Was it the introduction of inflation? The answer was that it took 2 world wars to essentially destroy most of the existing capital stock in Europe in order for a more egalitarian post-war generation to exist. This essentially created a middle class that owned about 40% of the wealth and consisted of 40% of the population. 50% of the population continued to own no property, while the top 10% owns 60% of the wealth. In the U.S., punitive taxation levels of 90% kept inequality low, essentially keeping the American middle class from suffering the same fate. Piketty points out that the 90% tax rate was hardly ever paid. Instead, what it did was to keep executives (who essentially set their own pay) from asking for compensation at that level. When those tax rates were dismantled in the 1980s, CEO and other executive compensation sky-rocketed in response.<br /><br />So how does the world look going forward? It looks grim. We are currently in a situation where in the US and Europe, capital from inheritances and capital from savings through work average about 50%. By 2050, if things don't change, we could easily see a return to inequality levels seen during the Gilded Age: most high net-worth households will be those who are inherited, and once again, your path to success would lie mostly in marrying rich rather than hard work and entrepreneurship. The dystopia of Blade Runner or Elysium never looked more likely than through Piketty's statistics. To balance that out a bit, Piketty points out that the European and US welfare states do cushion the blow somewhat: elderly poverty is down substantially since social security was introduced, and the European safety nets are even more generous. Of course, there's no shortage of the usual suspects wanting to tear that down...<br /><br />Is there any possibility of change? Piketty proposes a global tax on capital, essentially a wealth tax. This is by far the most disappointing section of the book, not because such an idea wouldn't work, but because the political climate just wouldn't allow it. Furthermore, he works in lots of other issues that have very little with inequality and other topics covered by the book. For instance, he covers ways to pay down the national debts of various countries with a one-time exceptional tax. Since Piketty is French, he spends a lot of time discussing the Euro and the need for Eurozone cooperation and sanctions against tax havens, which is an international problem.<br /><br />But seriously, that's a small nit on the book. I haven't even covered many of the side-topics that Piketty covers in the book. For instance, there's a huge discussion of slavery in the US in the antebellum South. This was a tour de force, as Piketty shows how much wealth slaveholders had: essentially, the northern US states were poor compared with old Europe, but the southern US states were wealthier, and of course, with a correspondingly higher wealth inequality. There cannot be more impoverishment than the inability to own even your own labor, and Piketty's statistics and graphs show the benefit of being on the other side of that equation in stark relief.<br /><br />Piketty also discusses the American education system in contrast with the European systems, and how elite American colleges perpetuate the inequality that already exist in society: the majority of their incoming students come from the top quartile of society. He does point out the advantages of charging insanely high tuition, so you do get something for your money. Nevertheless, this goes a long way towards understanding why elite American colleges' acceptance tests seem very similar to the old-school European finishing school, complete with piano-playing and other tests of altruism and &#34;leadership.&#34; They essentially have not drifted too far from those original prototypical elite institutions.<br /><br />Finally, is there anything practical you can learn about personal finance in this economics book? The answer is yes. The first of which is that real-estate is a mug's game. Today's real-estate yields about 3-4%. Why so low when all other capital earns 4-5% real returns? The answer: real-estate is the only capital today subject to Piketty's wealth-tax. That wealth tax seems small: 1-1.5% of property value per year. But since it's levied every year, it imposes a drag on performance that's much higher than the capital gains tax, which are the subject of inter-state competition and hence tends towards zero over the long term. Piketty points out that the higher up the wealth ladder you go, the lower the proportion of real estate owned in the portfolio because of these characteristics. In other words, it's better to be equity-heavy and house poor than equity-light and house rich. The other lessons are fairly obvious: you want to have the lowest costs possible (both in investment costs and living expenses) so that your capital has the highest chance to compound. The bigger your portfolio, the faster the money will grow: Piketty points out that there's no difference in performance between Bill Gate's portfolio and Liliane Bettencourt's portfolio, even though one was a brilliant entrepreneur and the other is the heiress of the L'Oreal fortune. Capital is indifferent as to how you came by it. Furthermore, the largest portfolios grow the fastest. The elite university endowments for instance, grow at 8-10% a year, since once you get past a certain size you can take advantage not only of relatively expensive wealth managers through economies of scale, but you also have the ability to buy illiquid assets that cannot be easily sold and hence command a risk premium.<br /><br />In the writing of this review, my biggest fear is that I haven't convinced you that you must read this book. Not only does it give you tools with which to analyze the world (and Jane Austen's novels --- you might even be able to avoid having to read them at all, since Piketty does such a great job of picking out the essentials), it also gives you the context of why we are still feeling the effects of world war 2, 70 years after the event.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Pay whatever price you have to, ignore whatever pressing assignments you have to, read this book. It is that good, and whether or not you disagree with the politics, there's plenty in here for you to exercise your intellectual muscle on. Go to it.
B00DPM7RJW|5|Saying this book is amazing seems like an understatement. I loved it from beginning to end. Thank you for writing such beautiful books that I can totally lose myself in Colleen Hoover!!! You have a wonderful gift, and I hope that you continue writing many, many more books ;-)<br />If you are wondering if you should read this book or not, please read it. You won't regret it.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I am hooked on the hunger games! This is a great book easy read. Warning once you start reading you won't be able to stop!

B00FAPF5U0|5|This is the best game ever! Can be played alone or with friends. I can't wait until my lunch break so I can try to defeat a level!!
1452101426|4|Great book! I love seeing all the work that went into Brave. if you are a fan of Pixar, or just production art books in general I recommend picking this one up.
B0055B7K7A|4|Very cute movie. It's family friendly, but adults will enjoy it as well. It is rather amusing.
B004CT5GOU|5|Granddaughters Christmas gift. I think we loved it as much or more than she did.
B00SXK316E|5|The story telling of this great romance from a woman prospective was a complete delight.
B008JMKN4Y|2|While I love Travis, I didn't buy-in the background written for Abby.  Mick appears and then disappears?.. I think the development of the story should have been here, and not with the back and forth obsessive relationship of Travis/Abby.  I loved the friendships with America and Shepley, but I think the entire story could have been told in 200 Pages or less.
B009ZQC7MY|5|As a fan of the 1970s Masterpiece Theater &#34;Upstairs Downstairs,&#34; this gorgeous, period high brow soap is must see viewing.  Edgier than the older series, the story lines are more modern and the acting is spot on.  The series will become a classic.
B0031R5K72|4|Very engaging story that holds your interest until the end. Interesting concept having death as the narrator. As well as dealing with the plight of the Jews it also gives an insight into the lives of an ordinary German family under the Nazis. The main character Liesel developes through the book. Look forward to seeing the film.
B007SGM084|5|What an extraordinary book. I could not put it down. Amazing is all I can say. Strong characters. 50 shades is absolutely intriguing. Can not say enough good about this book. Best one I have read in a long time
B003UYUP58|5|Fascinating read.
B00DR0PDNE|3|Just a 3 star for me.  The problem with this device is that when casting from a tab in the chrome browser, the playback on your TV will usually skip (especially the audio portion).  If you cast from the sites that are designed for chromecast (like youtube), then it will not skip and plays smoothly.    I stream from a variety of sites outside of Netflix, youtube, and was disappointed that there were too many annoying skips/audio distortions when casting from the browser tabs.    But for $35 its not a bad deal. If you have a phone, a TV, and do not own a laptop, its very useful.  If you already own a laptop, its probably easier to stick with hooking a VGA from your laptop to TV and doing it that way (no skips that way).
B00JOT3HQ2|5|This is a great game very very challenging you should get this game everyone again very fun and mind entertaining game
B00AKKTDJY|2|I got this game as the Free App of the Day and have played quite a bit since. I loved the game for the first restaurant or two...then the relentless ads began. Between EVERY SINGLE LEVEL you get a pop-up ad wanting you to upgrade (with a cost  that is 4x more than the game price).  Even worse  I can't even play the \\"bonus\\" restaurant  which is what is supposed to make it \\"Deluxe.\\"  There is a meat grinder, but I have no idea what it is supposed to do. I see a meat patty, by  nothing else happens. You can get through the first level since  it' s the last customer who orders it, but you  won't be able to complete any orders after that. Guess I'll be uninstalling. It was fun while it lasted, but irritation won out in the end.
B00687Q0VC|5|One of the best reenactments of any American history period, period!
B00FN2KR2G|5|This is my second book that I have read by Duncan, and I must admit, there was something I overlooked in the first book, namely, that Duncan is more than just a great writer. He is superb! Humor, wit, masterful stroke of a pen that leads you in the wrong direction on purpose, then takes you back to where he wants you to go. I've notice the reviews that are critical often miss the point of his intent, but to be sure, there is plenty of intent, and if you stick it all the way through, you will be rewarded with a great smile. I'm not one for putting books in boxes or checking off labels, so I won't. All I can say is that is a darn good book by an even greater writer.
0739334026|5|VERY GOOD
B00ESNDQWY|5|Very good
B005C8ENI0|4|We really enjoyed the movie, especially since it is based on a Grishom novel. There were some great twists but in the end we don't know who the real killer was or if it was a team. Now we'll have to read the novel. Not a bad thing, just a necessity now. Enjoy!
B0094BB4TW|1|So, the Facebook app was working perfectly until yesterday! I hear it's a new update or something but this update has made this whole app go to waste. Every time I tap it, it pretends to load and then goes back to the main screen shortly after. Why didn't they make sure this would run smoothly on ALL devices is a big question for me.<br /><br />To all of the people about to get this app please take notice of reviews, and until this starts getting good ones you should probably stay clear of this app. The new update will frustrate yo because it doesn't let you on by any means. So instead vet a different app or use Internet for now.

B0083GQKQG|4|Every time some deranged individual goes on a mass killing spree, we rightly focus our attention and concern on the victims and the devastated loved ones they leave behind. But who thinks about the impact such events have on the family of the killer?  Well, the makers of \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" certainly have, and the result is both heartbreaking and blood-curdling to witness.<br /><br />This grimly fascinating indie drama focuses on Eva (Tilda Swinton in a bravura performance), the mother of a troubled teen who slaughters a number of his fellow classmates in a high school assembly.  The multi-tiered screenplay by Rory Kinnear and director Lynne Ramsay looks at Eva's life both after the massacre and in the years leading up to it (Kevin is played  by three different actors  at various stages of life).<br /><br />From the beginning, Kevin is clearly a problem child, a \\"bad seed\\" as it were, for lack of a better term (think of Damian sans the supernatural powers and Satanic bloodline).  Perpetually frustrated and exhausted, filled with self-loathing and doubt, Eva spends every waking moment struggling to be a decent mother to her child, but nothing she does or says can break through the emotional barrier the sociopathic Kevin has set up between himself and the world.  Eva is further isolated by the fact that Kevin even has his own father (John C. Reilly) deluded into believing that the problem does indeed lie with Eva, in her weaknesses and inadequacies as a mother - almost to the point where even Eva, at some level, begins to believe it herself.<br /><br />Swinton breaks our hearts every step of the way as she wages a constant, solitary battle against a force she has no hope of ever understanding or controlling - for all the parents around her seem to have no such problems raising their own, much more reasonable and malleable children.  It leads us to the broader question of what happens when that most basic of all human bonds - that between a parent and a child - is irrevocably broken.  And how is a parent to love a child who steadfastly refuses to love her back?<br /><br />And life is certainly no better for Eva after the killings, for now she is forced to live out the rest of her life as a pariah in a community that blames her in large part for the tragic loss it has suffered, a community that has no interest in reaching out to her for understanding or healing. Her fate, then, is to struggle on alone, devoid of sympathy, compassion and any chance at reparation.<br /><br />\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" may be one of the bleakest and most despairing portraits of parenthood and childrearing ever committed to film, but it makes for a haunting and unnerving experience that you will find very hard to shake.- is irrevocably broken.

B00004Z4SD|5|Inexpressibly moving story of an old man who is determined to set things right with a brother he has not spoken to in 10 years, while there is still time. It is a film about the goodness in everyday people and how it surmounts the pain and and evil that every life encounters.  It tells of gentle triumph over the inevitability of life's end and the aging that precedes it.  Especially suitable for older viewers or anyone with sensitivity to the process of aging.
0061438294|5|Very revealing, entertaining, easy to read and understand. The photos are an added visual instruction which helped me very, very much in understanding the written information.
B009XIXVU6|4|I really enjoyed learning more about the Afghan culture and trials of living.  Really held my interest throughout.  Can't wait for his next book.
B002NZTZ8S|5|My favorite holidays movie. I just believe every time I watch it =). It brings happiness, faith, and hope. I wish we all could share the dream.
B00005YW4H|4|Loved this album!! Songs were all really well written, and you can tell she will be a fantastic artist in years to come! You wont be disappointed.
B001O54NKS|5|I'm a child of the 80's, and Dokken, along with Van Halen were my two favorite bands.  Shredding guitar, soaring vocals and memorable riffs and beats are king in this album.  The songs are now on my I-Pod!
1419702238|5|I have one grandson that read every book with a passion.  He is being followed by his younger brother who has requested that I be notified of every new book.
B00SH04286|3|clever, starts out well, really intriguing but becomes pretty rediculous in the last half hour.
B00EJX2YGM|5|the whole saga!  just note that if you're partial to which picture you get on the cover, there's two sides to the case with both pictures included!
B006LSZECO|5|Flynn has written a masterful mystery novel with more twists and nuisances than I have encountered in quite some time.  The plot is thick, full of surprises even to the last page.  Flynn's development of characters is thorough which adds to the readers confusion about who is in the right here.  Creative, engaging.  A good read.
B00004TJTS|4|There are more movies for families and kids than there were a decade ago, but many of them are not very good. Not only do they teach us nothing, they are also limited in the entertainment department. That's one reason you should grab a video like My Dog Skip. It isn't a perfect movie, but it is perfectly delightful. It is also one adults can sit through without groaning. <br />It's 1943 in Yazoo City, Mississippi, and W.W.II is raging. Though the townsfolk face many sacrifices, life goes on apace. Nine year old Willie Morris [France Mount] is an only child who doesn't have friends because he is small for his age and bookish. The closest thing to a friend is next door neighbor Dink Jenkins [Luke Wilson], a star high school athlete. Willie idolizes him, but Dink is much older and will soon be inducted into the army. Jack and Ellen Morris [Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane] fret about how to help their son but disagree on a remedy. Ellen thinks they should get the boy a dog, but Jack, a stern, pensive man who lost a leg in a previous war, thinks Willie is too young. Ellen, a much more open and outgoing person, buys Willie a terrier puppy anyway. Jack protests but soon gives in, and Willie has his first true friend. <br />Skip is one of the rare dogs that everyone in town everyone falls for, except for the bootleggers that operate out of the town cemetery. The dog's being so well liked gives Willie more and more confidence. Soon Skip is trotting all over town [Ah! The days before leash laws!] He scampers right into the grocery store to get his daily bologna fix. America, of course, was still segregated in 1943. This doesn't stop Skip from making friends in the 'colored section.' As Willie puts is, dogs are smarter than people because they are color blind. This is a dog that goes with Willie to the movies, has his own seat and shares the popcorn. This is a mutt that literally fixes the kid up with his first childhood sweetheart. While fiercely loyal to his master, Skip wisely lets him fight his own battles. By doing this, he helps Willie become fast friends with the neighborhood gang of boys. <br />This picture is not all sweetness and light. There are a couple of scary scenes, and a few that will bring out the Kleenex, if for no other reason than that Skip is the kind of dog most of us wish we could have had as a kid. <br />My Dog Skip is based on the nonfiction book of the same name by Willie Morris. Skip really was his dog, and this fact makes the movie even more poignant. Mr. Morris died shortly before the film's release.
B0001HAHXW|4|It's eric going back to the roots, and getting away from the commercialism that he's trapped himself in for so many years. It's pleasing that he departed from albums like Reptile, which was very commerical. It's true, Clapton did sellout, but unlike groups like Metallica, Clapton is now getting it right, and returning to the days where he took risks and did his own thing. True, its a covers album, but I hope that this album will tkae him in a new direction. <br />    The album is good, recording quality is much more impressive than johnson's. However, Johnson sounds liek johnson and Clapton sounds like clapton. This is not Clapton doing John'sons songs liek johnson did them. its clapton doing johnsons's songs in his style. <br />   If you wanted to get back in the roots of old blues, this is a good place to start.

B00BEZTMFY|5|I already knew that I would like the movie after seeing it in the theater.  Before viewing the movie I had been dismayed that one book was going to be turned into three movies.  However, all of the extra, &#34;prequel&#34; type information found in other Tolkien books is a pleasing addition to the story.
B0089LOG02|5|This often forgotten piece of history is told in a touching and thought provoking way. I found myself caught up in the story and feeling with the characters as they went through their experiences. Even though the book is not long, I finished it in two days because I was so drawn into the story.
B00IXHBS6M|4|“Part of the challenge and excitement of revisiting a record upon reissue is trying to hear the music again with fresh ears, seeing if you can tap into that feeling of discovery that came from hearing it the first time. When (one is) able to mentally put oneself into this place— the kid who got his driver’s license a month ago, driving around listening to (Album X) on tape—the reissue sounds as thrilling as ever.”    Let's get one thing straight: These are all 5-star worthy albums, and if you do not own these in any form, start here. The 4-star rating I gave above is explained below.    The thoughtful prose above came, surprisingly, from Pitchfork, at the beginning of their review for the new Led Zeppelin reissues (I, II & III). I rag on Pitchfork quite a bit, and damn it most of the time I’m right to do so. This was one of those rare Pitchfork reviews devoid of pretension and overflowing with sensitive insight into why Led Zeppelin and these expanded reissues still matter. Yeah, I know. Wow.    I buy a lot of these Expanded/Anniversary/Deluxe/Remastered/Legacy Editions, and the bottom line is simple: some of them are worth it, and some of them aren’t. I have a little over 250 of these, so I thought I’d start to review a few, and I might as well start with these new Led Zep deals. I won’t get into commentary on the original album itself, trying to stick to the following qualities, instead:    1. Packaging (30%)  2. Bonus Disc(s) (40%)  3. Sound quality (20%)  4. Overall Impression (10%)    The packaging of all three are similar, a slim digi-pack design with faithful representations of the original covers on the front, including III’s die-cut and wheel (if any of you know the official term for that kind of thing, please let me know in the comments section). The back covers are sort of a photographic negative version of the originals, meant to represent the bonus disk content, which for the most part are alternate versions of the original songs. The tri-fold digi-pack is nice, but the disks are in their cardboard pockets a little too tight for my comfort. The booklet could have been better, too. No essays, no commentary, just the bare bones facts about the music and players within, complete with a few nice photos. For its faults, I’ll take off 10 points. 20/30    The bonus discs for #2 and 3 are stellar, as I said mostly alternate takes of the originals, but they are better than average and I certainly wouldn’t rate any of these unworthy. The alternate version of Whole Lotta Love, for instance, sounds even more dangerous and vital than the original. The bonus disc on Led Zeppelin I, a live concert from around the time of release, is s***. I mean, it sounds like s***. Terribly recorded, I couldn’t finish the whole thing. Just awful, not even worth having as a curio. That said, I’d rate II and III perfect scores, and a big fat zero for Zep I’s bonus “material”. 27/40    The sound quality is brilliant. Not much different to the most recent remasters (on, say, the Mothership collection), and certainly not too loud. To my ears this is the best I have ever heard Led Zeppelin. 20/20    My overall impression? I’m impressed, and I have to say it’s about time this bands individual albums got the respect they deserved, even if they could have been a little better. In the end it’s really all about the music, and what’s here, apart from the live disc, is untouchable. 8/10    Overall score: 75/100
B00DPM7TIG|5|Found this a compelling story and full of historical content. Very beautiful language.
B00JOT3HQ2|4|This game is great but challenging it will be a little easier if you made it halfway it save if you die.
B00BW5K5DO|5|Cool Beans!!!  This is a absolutely great game so far just started it today !!!<br />It is a fine display of how mostly of these games work !!! I love it !!!
B00L9B7IKE|1|I haven't  read the book so I cannot rate this book
0805062971|4|i loved the movie and that's why i bought the book. book is cool… a lil different when you read the book!
B003TSEEDY|2|I personally hated this book. I thought it was weird, written badly and too repetitive. I didn't like the style of writing either; the whole book is just letter after letter describing this poor kids life, thoughts and experiences. The subjects made me uncomfortable making me almost find this book trashy rather than enjoyable at all. This is just my personal opinion and if you feel the same way about repetition, reading letters someone wrote (writing style), and awkward sexual experiences, don't waste your money. I don't see how this book is popular at all.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I was a sniveling mess by the time I finished. I absolutely loved it. I think that the moral and the lessons learned in this story are lessons I won't forget. I think this touched me more than it might have had I not been touched, through a family member, by cancer. This just goes to show that we are not immortal we are so devastatingly and breakable mortal. Not only was this a great inspiring  story, it was  a beautiful love story. I someday hope that I could have a love so pure as theirs.
B00KWVZ750|5|My son enjoys the game. It is easy for him to play since it has a guide that shows him what to do.
B00QR7ZN16|5|The musicianship on this album is incredible. I listened to this album four times all the way through. I found the lyrics online because I couldn't understand or hear them clearly at times. This album gets better with every time I listen to it. If you like D'Angelo, I think that you like his latest effort too.
B00EEDJM2Q|5|I love the game! It requires you to think which is a great thing! This is a good game for all ages. The challenge is to see how fast you can solve it but I prefer to take my time and solve it in one try versus several.
B004J4WLB4|5|I loved the complexity of Victoria.  She was real and awful and afraid and smart and sad.  I enjoyed the story and I loved learning about the flowers.
B002M5E2DW|5|Even though this book has been out for some years, I am just now getting to read it. I had heard about it, and honestly thought it was just some meditation type thing and like so many other fluff books that just re caption common sense things that you already know. I couldn't have been more wrong! The principals in this book absolutely works!!! After reading this, I applied it directing towards my family situation. Literally, the NEXT DAY I got a call from my brother who I haven't been in touch with in 20 years! So many other amazing things have taken place that I'm running telling as many people that will listen about this book! Get it and apply what's in it and you won't be sorry!
034580404X|5|Fantastic after curling up on the lounge I finish one of the better books I have read in a long time. Eight hours of solid reading and I could not put the first book down... Can't wait to start the second book
B00EHMFC78|5|This book begins with three totally separate and seemingly unrlated stories.  Each one is intense and interesting.  As the book continues, the three stories become related, and tie together!  It is very interesting all through!  Really was complated captivated by this book!
