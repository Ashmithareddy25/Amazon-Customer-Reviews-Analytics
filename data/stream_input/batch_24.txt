B00EI6CKVE|5|this says it all!
B000066OC7|5|When it arrived I thought it was going to be way to thin to be any good. Not so, it is VERY comfortable and really does the job for my backside which has no body fat. Haven't had it long enough to see how long it will last before I need a new one but know I'll buy another one just to have on hand, it's that great.
B001GS2PB2|5|Easy installed great look exellence product
B00C736TSA|5|Works as it should
B006SA59FC|5|First class
B00JA3BMDW|4|I bought this to check vent/register temps in a apartments. It does the job great for what I paid for it.
B005JU5XE4|5|They work great on my BMW 325i 2002
B002PQQC86|5|Very nice and well fitting into the front number cover.
B008CFVV0I|5|Came a day early took 5 minutes to install works fine no problems
B00XJC5D26|5|Very nice ..
B002MH1W42|5|My car's rear looks nice. Next time I will order a darker gray color. The one I have is too light but overall I'm satisfied.
B00WNGV0WG|5|My daughter loves it!
B000O5DUP8|4|Worked fine, the gasket holds it in place - a little worried it might come out over time but stayed put for a 600 mile trip
B002K5Q6GK|5|This is my second one! Bought a new car and had to put a new Hello Kitty Decal on it! This one was a little harder to affix, but afterwards, it's stayed on just as well as my first one.
B009UKUUWE|5|This is an amazing machine, but I really like the entire company better.  The entire Griot company is a class act.  This polisher does a terrific job.  I had a problem with mine, and they quickly exchanged it.  No questions asked.  I was amazed.  If you have a car and like to make the paint shine....this is the polisher for you.  Talk to them and they will recommend the right products for your application.
B004KZXYXG|2|The item that is pictured is not what you're getting.  It's a soft, mesh item.  It's not firm, it doesn't looks like leather, and it doesn't fit snuggly.  Luckily the return process is quick.
B0013GF8YS|5|Just what I wanted
B00KTI01DE|2|Disappointed for a second time... I bought this key, took it to the dealership to get it programmed for a $35 fee... and the crew at the dealership told me that they were getting faulty codes when they were trying to program the push to start functionality... so the doors/trunk opening works, if you use the key by putting it directly in the ignition it works as well... but the car is unable to detect the key fob for the push to start. So in a few words is not fully operable. My car is a challenger 2011...
B004GDBBVO|1|Material is less sturdy than OEM causing mine it to distort in hotter weather. It caught the tire and grinded away. This happens only after driving it twice. It was installed with all clips and fasteners as well.
B00AO6HO9U|5|Great helmet if its good and graphics are excellent arrived right on time
B00ESBOL3E|5|The light is great, nice and bright to light up the dark roads of Maine! I'm having trouble finding the correct &#34;over the windshield&#34; mount for my F250 though...
B000JFJLP6|5|This product has been such a lifesaver.  Helped many people with a dead battery.<br />Carry it in my car always.
B01257LSOC|5|It's way bigger than I thought but absolutely awesome!
B00JFZKAFQ|2|Quick and easy to install, but they are not all black. They have a brushed silver edge all along the board.
B007Y5E90G|5|Perfect fit for my 2003 Sequoia.  Seems sturdy and well made -- I expect years of protection for my dash and a cooler car.
B00BNH5ZX6|5|Just what I needed
B00777RDEK|5|This is a 30 minute install that will dramatically increase your use and enjoyment of your convertible. My 370z convertible top takes about 25-30 seconds to open or close. That may not seem like much, but the SmartTop essentially takes your wait to 0. For example, I now use my remote as I approach the car to drop the top as I walk across the parking lot. Also, when I get to my next stop, I get out and let my remote close the top, windows, and lock the car as I walk to the next store. Also, it does not require that you press the close or open button continuously for 30 seconds. You simply quick tap it and it goes up or down - as you drive. It's my favorite add to my 370z roadster. Also, Stefan, from technical support is very responsive, helpful and committed to helping you enjoy this device.
B007ZDFBIG|1|Didn't meet my expectations . To short doesn't fit over the whole valve stem .  Should supply a better product .
B00080QHMM|5|Works good, simple, solid.  Updating my review after owning this over a year, still works great
B00QCI2V10|4|Great.
B0036NEUW2|5|We love them thanks
B00DU4RL00|5|POWER TO THE NW!
B007G2KJTW|5|Pretty. Using end of Sept. Camping trip.
B002PQU6ZQ|5|Excellent
B0009NWQWI|5|This product exceeded my expectations on a recent cross country trip.  Our SUV was loaded with stuff we needed for our winter home.  In the saddlebag we carried a large ice chest and our two travel suitcases (airline carry on size).  The saddlebag did not move or shift during travel.  We used the strap belt around the rear hatch door and not the lower belts to the frame and this was not a problem.  We had no significant reduction in fuel consumption that one would have if the bag was on top of the car.  Our 2007 Honda Pilot averaged over 20 mpg for the trip, about what I would expect without the saddlebag.  Even though our load pushed the size limits of the bag, the vinyl is heavy gauge and was not damaged in 2200 miles of travel.
B00SXA289K|5|Standard sign - looks just fine
B00J6ZI4JE|5|Super easy to put on a 2015 Toyota RAV4.  30-40 minutes. very clean installation.<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtCUHdd2VSs
B0056BODWY|4|I like it...  It looks awesome on my FJ Cruiser and shows off what I love.  The cover is of high quality... The only issue I had was the mounting configuration.  The cover comes with two wire compression pins.  There is a large and small size.  Both fit my 2&#34; hitch, but the locking pin did not keep the cover on tight and snug, but rather loose and hanging enough that it could be stolen.  I modified one or the compressions pins so that my locking pin too hold the cover tight to the hitch and theft thwarted.
B001SGC6T8|4|Good price and easy to install
B00F64RTTU|5|These floor mats fit great. They catch a ton of dirt that would normally end up smashed into the carpet. I would highly recommend them.
B007HO4HVA|5|Very nice product and it fit my vehicle as stated.
B003L643KS|4|received quick and is what is advertized
B00KTIUPPI|1|Not good doesn't reach very far.  Stick with original equipment
B007V2VW0W|5|It's really great
B001TXMOW4|5|Perfect for my BMW 1200 GS!
B003CJLH8K|5|very good and fast service
B0028JN6XE|5|Good looking.  Replaced 3 sets.  Will buy again when they give up.
B00CQAR2DU|5|Fit like a glove, no problems & a reasonable price.
B009MPC7IC|3|received quick and is what is advertized.  after installing them, about an inch is dragging the ground.  difficult to trim, if you don't trim ends off the ground,  it just swirls everything up
B007MUY7PK|4|work great, fast shipping
B00O8ZNJ2Y|5|Fit perfect for my 07 Cadillac Escalade ESV for daytime running lights!
B005271AZA|5|Outstanding. Now my Wrangler looks way better with this addition covering the petro tank filler cap. Installation was a breeze. Thanks loads
B00DHP2EAE|5|Fit perfectly on 2004 KIA Sorento.
B000CCM63K|4|amazing stuff
B000A6VCFQ|4|Worked fine
B00C8OWNNI|2|If the sticker looked just like this picture, I would have been very happy with my purchase. The look comes across like heavy diamond plate. If I had not worn the &#34;Electric Butter knife&#34; I would not have recognized it for what it was. It is a shame because I had been looking for this very sticker for years to put on my truck. As far as delivery, came sooner than expected, so by all means no complaints there. The search continues however.
B005JZD6KM|3|Please check to see whether you car will need a Type A or Type B extender.
B0094E5K9Y|5|So far so good.  Has kept its shape after 3 months of use and kept my driveway from being &#34;dented&#34; by the jack.
B005NLQAHS|5|Easy to use...opened package and had code for check engine light within 20 minutes.  I think finding alternate app for phone took longer than retrieving code.  Mechanic told me what I already knew...failed oil pressure sensor.  Wish it was a little smaller so I could leave it installed all the time.  It hangs into my leg area.
B00RRCHND6|4|Just right for my needs. Folds easily for storing in trunk.
B000IYPSZU|5|Went right in. Great shipping. Works perfect.
B0006GF5SK|4|good
B000C6OLH0|5|Yes, it is a oil filter.  No, it isn't a silencer.
B00HZOBRP6|5|Catches all my kid's crumbs.
B002307TJU|5|Filters Air. Effectively.
B003G0KBK0|5|These were marked and sold as refurbished but could not tell them from Brand New.  Fit great in my truck, 2012 Silverado Crew Cab 2500,  and definitely keep my carpet cleaner than the &#34;regular&#34; floor mats that I had been using.  Easy to take out and clean as well.  Very happy with overall performance.
B00G668RZM|5|Perfect fit and only took a minute to install.
B00E9FSCDY|5|Exactly what I needed and was shipped in a timely manner!
B0068ETZ44|5|Good, solid quality stuff. No junk here
B00PF6LAF8|5|Love these lights, perfect for smoothing out the ceiling after removing old tube fixtures. You do have to turn each one on or off individually, but that's not big deal. Simple to wire in, very bright light, much cheaper than the ones from Camping World and seem to be just as good quality. You won't go wrong here.
B00367LKE4|5|Original, fabulous and very elegant product.
B00XYXPWL2|5|Great sticker. Excellent instructions and tips for applying it. Will definitely buy from Yoonek again.
B002DETCKK|5|Works great.
B00R7HJFAK|5|Works really nice and had peace of mind when carrying a lot of cargo for a trip to be secure in case of an accident.
B003G25RVG|3|Ehh, so so.  Fits loose, black stuff rubs off on fingers and hands.  Price is right for this item.
B00UVXDIS2|3|It served it's purpose, but it was one long strip and I was expecting two separate pieces.
B000CO96JA|5|This is a fill plug for the differential. I was able to clean the original to the degree it looks brand new and like this one. I will keep this as a back up for when the original does need replacing. Fits 07 dodge dakota SLT rear differential perfectly.
B00Y90KSLI|5|Part was exact. Would have preferred faster shipping but still great value
B000C3YTL6|5|I use K&N oil and air filters in every vehicle I own.  Never ever had a problem!
B004131JHK|5|As expected
B00XN63KZU|1|Description was wrong so we got wrong ones been horriable getting them returned had to tale a.loss bad experience
B0089K9NH4|4|I got the remote entry to work easy, still need to have it programed to start car
B009I6BEDY|5|Great fit great quality
B00VMYP08U|5|Looks awesome on my bike. The paint doesn't chip easy.
B008SFF67Q|4|That expect what I want
B00RHBC50S|4|Package came quickly and look new. Haven't install it yet thou to see if of works hence the 4 star only. Price is great and the light that is built in to indicate when pressuee is low im loving it
B00MM0NPGC|4|expensive to install, brackets not quite good for front bumper application, had to make my own for Jeep Cherokee trail-hawk.
B004A3YJZ0|5|Exactly as described....
B00EKN2P60|4|very good product, purchased more of them after installing the first couple
B0096QB94K|4|It's starting to show some rust....but I like it.
B00QN8NIKW|1|Os paper
B006AVJPE0|5|it shipped the day i ordered and i got it the first day possible and while the stitching is a little crooked the mask is made with strong and comfortable material and looks exactly as pictured
B00RTJKCRG|5|Rally good helmet
B000PTKONY|3|im not sure about using this item on larger tires, but it did work on my 1985 honda atc. the bead breaker just doesnt have the right design or maybe enough steel as it will bend if you treat it like a industrial tool. IT IS NOT !
B0063CU5T0|5|Love it. Looks great on my impala
B00AHJJMS0|5|Bosch quietcast  rotors are awesome
B0062WC9IQ|1|Got two of these neither one worked.
B000JZURAE|5|The supports installed easily on my '05 liberty.  They are &#34;strong&#34; as the brand indicates. My only mistake was not reading the description carefully...only one in packet instead of one pair...so i had to order twice...doh!
B006N99EXQ|2|EVERYONE NOTE !  INFORMATIONAL NOTE:<br />The &#34;Advantage&#34; line of AC-Delco parts is their &#34;All Makes/All Models&#34; economy line (meaning cheap stuff for your $400 beater car you don't want to put money in)<br />The higher quality &#34;All Makes/All Models&#34;  line doesn't say Advantage, nor have an &#34;A&#34; suffix on the part number---try 46G0424 for better quality.
B002UZGCNC|5|Working like a charm.
B004UM6DLE|5|does very well with the cleaning.  And fun to watch the action.
B002LGPXBC|5|After calling to confirm fit for a 2013 Triumph Explorer, there was a slight modification required in order to install. After that, everything went very smoothly and I'm very happy with the new risers.
B00ILINN20|5|Great price, got here quick, fits perfect.
B004AE0F4S|5|Great product to replace old headlights. It does have a sma percent of tint to it that gives it a better look.
B001DRHMLY|1|Not a good filter for my car. BMW. Fits as advertised , but has very poor performance. Replaced it with a K&N.
B005FNW1JU|5|My brother put it on his truck, really likes it!
B00FSLPFYM|4|Perfect.
B00C7I4PL8|3|great
B002R4U72I|4|Seems to be of a good material.
B00T8HPP24|5|great product, great company. with any new technology, or new application of said tech. there will be a few glitches or in some cases maybe a lack of understanding on how best to use it. all that being said my headlights from Kensun work well.  love the extra light and quality of light I'm getting from them.  I did however have an issue with the install, nothing major but enough that I had to seek support &#34; I should more often do this but sometimes pride and thinking I can figure it out gets in the way. but I digress. the lamp holder supplied I stripped out on the install, it happened too easily but nonetheless it did. but the wonderful people at Kensun took good care of me.  so now only time will tell as to longevity.  they do seem well made.
B003PIQN0U|5|Shipped on time and had a few minor scratches on it, but its a hitch, not artwork. Goes on just as stated in the directions provided with the hitch. It took me 2 hours to install and I am mechanically knowledgeable. Its not hard, just dropping the exhaust took about half the time along with cutting bigger holes. I used a dremel with a metal cutting wheel to do that. Bolts right up and fits great. It does hit the bottom valence of my bumper but that is plastic and bends up easily to accomodate. I got this for a Ford Fusion.
B00HHGRXA0|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B000CGB48Y|5|Great seller. Item as described and shipped on time. Thanks
B00FGJIOSA|5|Good product
B00CN2K6QG|1|wrong item
B008YU5REM|5|this exhaust got received a little late but I am very happy with the customer service that I had, contacted them and sent me a new on and got it just a couple days after!!!:) very simple to install, took myself 15 mins. the sound is just perfect and it looks amazing!! thanks amazon
B004EFFX0Y|5|It done the job until I was able to upgrade to an aluminum roof.
B0049O9PKO|5|Product as described and met my needs
B0002SRGFW|3|No review
B00TUJY3R8|3|They said it would fit into factory holes and easy to install for a 2014 Jeep Patriot. That was not the case. I had to take them to a shop to have custom holes drilled and spaces made to fix large gaps, which are under the Jeep. Wasn't really a big deal just cost extra money and time. They look good. Just not an exact fit for my jeep as stated.
B00S4REKC0|1|did not fit
B0115Q19FM|5|Very nice.  Just what I was looking for.
B0058KYUWQ|5|Couldn't been any better
B001BNFV0Y|5|got the product yesterday, really great product, look forward to using the product.
B000C9MYQM|1|this belt does not fit. ford f250 xlt 4x4 460 85 amp alternator. you need to know the amp before you order very important.
B00FQANS76|4|Nice quality - stick wells, but I thought they were just pink - not with a white background. Might own fault for probably not reading the description well.
B009EVM810|4|The in channel design was OK. When installing , it is important to ensure the track is clean. At first the window does not go up tightly until the adhesive is secure...so be sure to leave the windows up for a few days until it sets up correctly.
B006TM1FM0|5|Very great key, very durable ! Legit Sti Key, cut into my 04 impreza 2.5ts
B00BTY5S8A|2|Some of my screws, washers, and bolts that said was required for assembly were not included , also top bar already had a dent.
B008MISDH4|5|Great
B00EK5FH2W|3|Have to modify headlight buckets for them to fit right. But look sweet after installed!
B00C0LJJAE|4|Steps one through six of the install were removing panels and plugging wires in. No problem.  But Step 7 was a surprise:<br />&#34;Route the black power wire from the vehicle battery as shown on the included CME-PCL-INS sheet.&#34;<br />The sheet just says to run the wire from one end of the car to the other, tie-wrap it in place, and be careful where you drill holes.<br />If you can do this, it's a great product!
B00ARUQULQ|5|Fit perfect !!!!
B0043IX1ZG|5|These little things are amazing, inexpensive fix that made my avalanche look alot better by being able to conjoin the cladding to the body!
B00MOR4D5U|2|When I first got the lights I was amazed but it's been 6 months now and even with me applying a Electrical grease 2 all the connectors on both lights water destroyed the connectors they were corroded to hell tried sandpaper even tried a connector cleaner to try and fix the problem neither one of them worked not real sure it is even with the sandpaper they seem to get pretty clean so I would recommend putting some type of heat shrink around every one of your connectors just for added safety because now I have $200 headlights that flicker turn on and off one of them even stays on high beam all the time it looks like great quality but in my opinion you pay for s*** quality no reason they should have done that I would not buy this product again
B00907YVT0|5|Love it.
B00TFZOP4I|1|These did not fit my vehicle.
B003IS3HV0|2|Too thick and gooey.  It's like oily syrup.  Takes a long time to soak in and you cant sit on the furniture for a while.  Would rather have a conditioning cream
B0031GRMC4|1|1st one I bought I had to replace at 13 months, this last purchased one failed inspection at less than a month old and I had to have it replaced at the inspection garage
B00BOEN7Z6|3|When I read that others say this cargo tray fits great, I wonder what I have done wrong. While I have secured it at the top of the back of the seats and under the latch covers, it does not fit well in the actual trunk.  It is a bit too wide and simply does not conform to the shape of my GT's cargo area.  What are those 3 horizontal strips for between the seat back covers and the actual cargo tray???  Can someone shed some light on this for me?  It is my installation or the cargo tray itself??
B002669U3O|5|Great Product- with Delivery!!
B00JGGFXS8|5|Was very good- way to that you were here for the 50th anniversary of the mustang.
B005EY80AE|1|Item used three times already starting to fall apart.<br />Plastic casing is torn, it's a shame as I love the principle of them
B001P22OY2|2|I'm giving this a 2 because of the packaging. I haven't seen this bad of a packaging job since I stopped using eBay. Obviously the seran wrap didn't protect it well as you will see from the pictures that some marring and chipping occurred on the corners. I wouldn't care except that this is an outdoor item and will rust very easily now at the exposed steel spots. Otherwise the item looks pretty solid and gives me about a 6&#34; extension.
B003XM75BO|5|Excellent price and quality
B002P8J2HW|5|excelente
B004DRQJ7O|5|The headlights were perfect.  Packaging was excellent.<br />Both left and right went in with no problems.<br />Pleasant surprise.  The order also included the harness with the 4 auxiliary lights.  But jeep design meant front grill removal is required to replace the harness.<br />I used the old harness and auxiliary lights.  I will replace with new one when I have extra time.<br />I would buy again from this supplier.
B001447FTA|2|Button jammed after a dozen uses. Not great quality.
B000K01WIY|5|Great price, excellent product, timely delivery.
B00GQGWE3S|5|Awesome light.  Put it on a Super Duty Ford with the kit to mount in the grill opening.  VERY bright.  Wired through a relay and my high beams so they come on automatically with my high beams.  Only drawback is the instructions are kind of vague but the light and mount are well made and very usable light.  This single light is twice as bright as the 4 Hella lights that I had on before this.
B00Q4YQBGI|4|Nice
B000BQMKM4|4|Didn't use it that much, but was a decent product.
B004KEMY5G|3|it is Plastic I was expecting a metal product ... not happy with it.
B00KJ18BI8|5|Great product!  Fast delivery.  Would definitely recommend.
B00UTK3C1U|5|Killer little lights, should be buying more soon for another project.
B000HACYNY|5|Works well!
B006C18PNA|1|Got this keychain exactly three weeks ago and thought it was very cute BUT last night it broke and all the pieces came apart and went everywhere!  I was only able to find two of the pieces so now I am ordering a different keychain....waste of money....I'm going to request a refund....ONLY LASTED THREE WEEKS!
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Really puts out some light. I was surprised for the money
B00DMA7U3U|4|Good party and good service.
B00WS3P37C|5|Extremely durable solid-steel product with a nice variety water-regulating settings. I've dragged this thing through brush while pulling a hose and dropped it on rocks repeatedly and it still shows no signs of damage.  I also found that the handle is easier to squeeze than previous nozzles I've owned, which is a nice plus.
B000M5Y720|4|BRIGHT WHITE compared to the regular bulbs used by Mazda
B001L410Q2|5|Works great
B004WHS6OE|5|Pretty happy with this. I use it for oil changes on my Rav4 and Mazda truck. Holds the 4 quarts of oil from a change easily enough and would be big enough to do both changes at the same time. The tray catches the oil pretty cleanly, though it's important to pay attention. The truck tends to start out with a veritable fountain shooting out to the side before ending as a dribble more or less straight down. I have to adjust the positioning of the container once the flow starts to tail off. Once the oil is in the container I've had no leaks or spills on the way to recycle the oil. The cap and plug both work fine. Seems to be made of durable plastic so I would hope for decent longevity.
B00AO0DRV0|5|Exactly as described.  Works great!
B00TEH7MGU|4|Great except the stickers don't look as detailed as the photo..but still great!
B004I9UFNQ|5|Exactly what I needed for my 2012 RAM 1500. Thank You.
B008Y3SIRC|5|Arrived fast and works great. Used this on a 96 tigershark montego. Improved design with two O-rings now.
B007CN9IJW|5|Finally I found something that works and will last.
B0040DTLJE|5|Just makes the manufactured rear-view mirror so tiny that I wondered how I thought it was sufficient.
B008G1WEK4|5|Good
B000O0TAZ2|5|Perfect!
B009I9BVK2|5|Received oil quickly and safely packaged.  Very good product!
B002NY5FHE|5|Good quality and price.
B0001CMUV4|5|Get this. Right now. Seriously, it's amazing. I pull my trailer off road and it sounded like something was going to break back behind me from the hitch bouncing everywhere. This seriously quietens it down and makes you forget there's a trailer behind you.
B003NWHFLY|5|Excelente
B0042XORMI|5|Perfect
B00CIXHR9Y|4|Exact fit for a 2006 Sonata.  It filters air....
B00HKTVK8U|5|These worked perfectly on my Honda Goldwing Motorcycle.  I wired them in with my Lizard Lights and mounted them on the bottom shroud, one pointing out left and one right illuminating the road just behind the headlight beam.  One of the lights was inop right out of the box.  I contacted the seller, who apologized and sent another complete set gratis - no return of the defective light was necessary.<br /><br />5 stars to the seller.<br /><br />One note, you must drill a hole in whatever you mount these in and wire into a source, like a door light.  If mounting in a car, that means removing the door panel, searching for the wire and drilling a hole in your door.  Included with the lights is the correct size hole saw for the drilling.  For my purposes - this was what I wanted.  Be sure it's what you want before purchasing.
B000NU3IW4|5|Works perfectly on my 1990 econoline RV with the 7.5 L V8 engine.
B002UC19R4|4|exact as old one seems to work as expected!
B00SS6LV2Y|3|buttons are worn, but it works fine.<br />Took about 5 mins to program.
B00XXBMQPK|5|For some reason the griffin adapter does not work that comes with the unit, I have to use a different micro usb cable. The item was replaced but it has the same issue. Other than this it does what I need it to do.
B00AESXMGM|5|Great Quality!!! Much better than I expected.
B000BOHKEO|1|Waste of money
B006VOTFS2|5|Great exhaust
B002UZGCSW|5|Identical to the VW filter at half the price to the dealer.  Perfect for my 2009 GTI.
B002FRXPEY|1|I bought 2 sets of these, one for my 2009 civic and another for my daughters 2006 civic. These are sub-par shocks for this application, in my opinion. They do not have the overall length of travel (fully extended) that the OEM ones do and mine are riding rough and making noises after about 2 months of wear on both applications. I am very, very disappointed.
B00MB0EDMS|4|The headrest part is a little loose but other than that it is really cute. The flowers are very detailed and pretty.
B00CHDGQVU|3|Flimsy plastic.  Holes did not match up well.  It was a little long so it did not fit flush.  I should have paid a little more for the OEM one.<br /><br />That said, for what it does (keep mud and dirt out) it does the job.
B002GTKAHQ|3|I purchased these mirrors to replace the enormous ones on my 1988 Suzuki GS450 for a mild cafe build. They installed quite easily and provide a great viewing angle, even running much lower bars. The convex design allows me to angle them so I can see directly behind me, as well as the lane beside me with very minimal distortion. The metal construction and rubber grommets keep them positioned securely as well. I'll be buying another pair for my Zuma 50 scooter.  **Update** I took my motorcycle on a fall ride at lower temperatures (45 or so). The mirror fell out of the housing and shattered, revealing that it was held on with the stingiest application of glue I've ever seen. I ordered another pair (the rest of the construction has been good), but I plan to pop the mirrors out and glue them in more securely.
B00L2NF1XA|5|Does just what it is suppose to do.
B00O7CLV1O|5|Thank You
B00EQ2Z03U|5|perfect fit!
B00DTU95Y0|4|good quality ... 5 minute install
B00HHH1864|5|NICE WHITE/ BLUE COLOR, FIT ON MY 2003 BMW 325i. LOVED THEM BUT COULDN'T USE THEM DUE TO THE FACT IN VA YOU MUST HAVE AMBER LIGHTS ON YOUR BLINKERS.
B00OLVGEJA|3|I bought this bed mat for my new 2015 short bed Chevrolet Colorado. Overall I am pleased with it as it does serve its purpose. However, the mat came and about a week after I had it I noticed that it had discoloration to it. about have the mat is a darker shade of black than the other half. Kinda bothered me, but again it is a bed mat, not made to be pretty. It serves its purpose and that is all I can ask for. The reason I purchased from amazon was the price was much, much cheaper than any auto website and came within 3 days after purchase.
B003E60T6M|5|Works as advertised.
B005P9WXMY|5|Just what we wanted to spruce up the new Merc!
B000PA00XM|5|WORKED PERFECTLY WITH MY 2003 BMW 325I .... NEED AN AUX HOOKUP AND THIS DID THE JOB, EASY TO INSTALL AND SOUNDS GREAT !! IF YOU NEED IT GET IT YOU WONT REGRET
B00HH13U1G|5|These are simply sturdy look food and work awesome
B003MY1EEC|4|Overall nice product. Like other reviewers I had to cut a small notch in my license plate to make it fit correctly due to the wiring for the led lights. Other than that I am very happy with this product. The black finish is nice and the LED lights are very bright. It made my custom license plate mount look very professional.
B00NGX9ZIG|4|I love this jacket, I do recommend getting a size up because, it fits a bit small. Do love the fact that you can remove the inner lining. Great for a first jacket
B004A6B91E|1|Main front O-ring seal leaked immediately.
B006DX3ED8|1|After 10 months, this converter snapped right at the point where the manifold meets the converter. Metal was paper thin, and it was missing a connection point that was on the old converter. I believe this is why the unit broke.
B002KQA5SE|5|sent back wrong size
B00NA8T15Y|5|Excellent, work as you expect
B0040505GK|5|Well Made product.  Hugs wheel in wind and has a strap that also secures the cover.  The colors look upscale.
B00ODCJEDU|5|worked real good, perfect fit, thanks again
B000Q3OTQC|5|I've always been a fan and user of K&N products.  I'm not sure if I get better gas mileage because of it but the engine sounds better when I step on the gas and it feels like I have better acceleration.  The recharge kit is essential when cleaning the air filter.  I keep my original around to put in for the day while this one is drying after cleaning it.  This has gone in my 2015 Jeep Wrangler and works great.  Other products I've used these in was an 2008 Dodge Avenger and I used the cold air intake on my old 99 Grand Cherokee Limited.  All products come with a warranty and are much better than the stock filters.
B00Q334X7O|5|Fit my 1970 ct90 like a glove.
B000BPUR84|5|Bought this for TBI conversion on a Jeep Wrangler. Worked perfectly.
B00JH34WC8|4|Installed on 2011 HHR LT1. Ride is very good compared to other springs I have had. After settling, lowered closer to 2&#34; in front and 2.25&#34; in rear. I would recommend these springs to anyone with an HHR that wants a lower look but yet a good ride quality.
B001H1I40O|5|It fits my Ford Edge 2011.
B0001K9RRQ|5|Just what I needed, although hard to find.
B009MATNZC|4|It is so nice to have a shade that fits and works.
B00RU9O4CO|2|Not happy with the depth of the mats and the back seat mat didn't fit like I think it should of and sits crooked as its the whole floor mat and it goes across the middle hump and even though I cut it down to fit it still isn't what I thought it was going to be ..
B004TRKBOK|5|Looks awesome, however I hope to never have to use.  I hope it works well in an emergency.
B0079IBNIE|4|good fit and no bunching
B00YLZ7C3S|5|I had been looking for something to hold a tissue box in place in my car.  Even trying a small box on the door pocket was working.  This is the perfect solution!  No more chasing a box of tissues around in the vehicle.  I have it hanging between the front seats.  It stretches quite a bit, so hanging behind the seat for back seat passengers would work for larger items.
B000BRFQKQ|5|GREAT PRODUCT, SOLD BY FABULOUS SELLER AT A REALISTIC PRICE!
B00KIERDDU|4|I bought this LED light set for my vehicle to respond to fire calls. The lights are fairly bright and they work great. The only problem I have is the spring in the connector is so stiff that it pushes itself out of the socket so I have to keep pushing it in periodically to keep it flashing. Otherwise, it's great.
B009FNWGXW|4|They are nice and great for the price my only complaint is that the drivers side rail had a small dent in it and the passenger side had a small less noticeable dent in it. It may have been UPS but I was a little disappointed when I opened the package and saw the small dent. I kept them and put them on my truck anyways but the dent was a small disappointment.<br /><br />Trinidad CO
B000GU24EE|5|Fit perfectly and came very quickly.
B0058EH9MU|5|Quick shipping exactly what I needed after lowering my car. Highly recommend
B00HMCMWIC|5|It's an excellent fit for my Yamaha golf cart...<br />It's vented, with a good zipper, and I am happy!
B00O06V3QK|5|Simple, durable, and does its job well. Really makes the hitch mount on my '14 civic less visible and look much cleaner without the gaping hole full of sand/dirt.
B004L0AAQY|4|they don't light as much as i wanted - but for the price the look great on my truck
B00D82NT6E|5|I just used a couple of these, and they work great....
B009DJUV1M|4|works fine
B005R4057C|5|Exactly what I ordered and they look great on my F150!
B0010GIBGS|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00647MAPG|5|Worked great
B004AIIYTW|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00W8DBZQU|5|I wish I had gotten the cargo mat too
B0040D2QC8|5|Worked just fine!
B004SFKJIQ|4|It's a porta toilet.  Too small if your of exceptional size
B009DJSH04|4|Works perfect
B000WKC4CK|5|Fit perfect, stops good
B00D9C2CDO|1|Does not hold up long, and definitely isn't waterproof! Water resistant but not waterproof especially when driving during a downpour.<br />After one season, the outside started cracking. I used it on two long trips and after one year it is now in the garbage. Get a good hard side and be done with the frustration. Plus it has marred the finish on the vehicle's top and the clear coat is damaged beyond simple waxing or buffing to repair the damage to the roof area. The straps became frayed by the wind and were useless after one 800 mile trip both ways. Do not waste your money on this product.
B004964AM0|1|Cheap with cheap result waste time
B00ILBIKXY|5|Easy to install....after reading other reviews!  I finally figured out that the screw that must be removed in order to slide the clips into place was on the inside of the track where clip goes.  It's not too hard to get out but it is a little awkward. Otherwise a good solid product that blends seamlessly with the factory installed rails.
B000CIQMT8|3|Does the job but is a poor replica of the OEM. The plastic is a glossy black and it doesn't cover the top of the door the way Ford's mirror does. You can tell the difference between both mirrors. There are better replicas for the same price. Check eBay
B00SH1SN6C|5|This is a great product, full of features and good quality. The power bank is made of sturdy plastic, and the alligator clips are very sturdy as well. The power bank can create a peak current of 500A, which is enough to jump start pretty much any vehicle with a 12V battery and gasoline engine under 5.0L (this means most sedans, coupes, hatchbacks, station wagons, and some trucks can benefit). Multiple safety features are in place, including a wrong configuration alert for if you were to connect an alligator clip to the wrong terminal on the battery. The flashlight is very bright as well, and has 3 modes: standard/steady on, SOS, and blinking. It's also nice that if my phone dies while I'm on the road I can charge it nearly 5 times with this power bank—from either a 2A or a 1A port (but the 2A port is faster for phones that support it). In the package is a nice case that resembles a toolbox, and inside that is the power bank itself, the jumper cables, a 15V wall charger for your home, and a 15V car charger. You also get a welcome guide, and a few warranty-related items. Be sure to register for the 18-month warranty on the RAVPower website! Overall, this is a great product and I think that you should consider this if your car suffers from battery-related issues (especially in cold winter weather, if your area is affected by that).
B000JFHNG0|5|Very nicely made piece here. The knobs and couplings are all very solid. I previously had a set with plastic knobs that almost instantly stripped. These work very nicely.
B00CKIP2EY|4|Very fast and perfect fit
B004I12438|5|Easy to install.
B00GIBPJBU|5|Always been a fan of mid-length sockets but never pulled the trigger on them.  Glad I did when I found this set, not only is the price amazing, but they're a quality tool made by a reputable company.  I used these right after they were delivered to do a tune up on my Subaru, anyone who owns one knows that having a flat 4cyl can make for a cramped engine bay on the sides between the engine and frame rails.  These sockets were so handy in a place where a normal shallow socket was too short and a deep socket just wouldn't fit.  Highly recommended!
B00SA5UXWM|5|Yes its a great item.  Fast shipping and it looks great on my bike.  Easy install with supplied directions.
B011D67O6W|1|The brackets for these bars didn't come close to fitting my Ram 1500.  Had to send them back.
B005KFG3PG|5|This nrg steering wheel is great. You can tell it was made withgood quality. Have no complaints.
B0002JMF98|5|Fits my vacuum pump and my 30 pound jug of 134a
B008G24ZUA|5|Excelente
B00Q1F7D0I|5|Excellent!  Came packaged will, and installed easily...thank you Ford
B00XZ9OMQ6|5|Exactly what we needed, and a good price.
B00H8EEWUA|5|Great products
B001OCVAOS|3|Instalation is easy but deezee needs to come up with better fitting &#34;crush&#34; nuts, they strip out the cab holes and make it a bitch. Lllso we cut 2.5 inches of the top lip and drilled new holes in the brackets so they dont  hang down as far. Looks good, works good.
B00RKHQY1K|3|This Cargo Net is not the sturdy net that I wanted.  It is stretchy, so it doesn't really stop the milk from falling out of the back. What you can not see is it is an envelope with no loops at the bottom to keep it taught.  If you want a pouch to hang stuff in, it works.
B000BYB5A4|5|very good
B002ZTOASW|5|Works great.
B001P2BUY2|5|Excellent product, worth every penny makes the car easier to clean
B0038B4AQI|5|Great product.
B002M589TA|5|The fluid pump was absolutely indispensable for my project - replacing the gear oil in my axle housing.  I also used it to fill the transmission oil (very old car) via a side access hatch that wouldn't have allowed me to pour from the container as I would normally do where space isn't an issue.  Although this isn't needed for routine oil changes and other tasks, it will definitely make those types of jobs cleaner.<br /><br />Yes - it takes a lot of pumps.  No - it's not tiring or beyond what's expected.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Great product, easy to use, and very much worth the cost.
B000CJ2URA|4|Works as described....my disco was running around 220 now it stays around 200 great for Texas or anywhere it stays hot .
B004HEKCKI|5|Fantastic.  I had been using Hawk &#34;blue&#34; brakes and these are so much better on my 2004 VW R32.  Under normal braking, these perform just like any other brakes.  However, when they heat up a bit (like a hard stop from freeway speeds) they grip amazingly well.  I tried a panic stop from 70 MPH on an offramp and actually bruised myself on my seatbelt.  (I have very sticky tires, but I still managed to trip the ABS a bit).<br /><br />Wear is also VERY good.  I have done about 5000 miles and 1 track day with these pads and still have 10mm left as measured by 2 different mechanics.
B010SESZQ8|1|Is not a direct  bolt on
B010BT4XSY|4|Decent product with a lower cost that the big names for the same item.
B000RDG7YI|5|good
B000UOFBQO|5|Perfect part. Much cheaper than genuine.
B000IYIUI2|5|Great product.  Works like it suppose to.  Installation was easy.
B007KI8LLA|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B0038FQQJI|5|Fit my Cube very well. And helps to keep​ some sunlight and rain out of the cabinet.
B000EDSTAG|5|Use it everyday. So far -no complains!
B004GE0FRE|5|Matched perfect
B00I96JZU8|5|Great product & shipper
B0007LZK9S|4|Hitch pendant clip are tightfitting in the socket and give very little slapper missed alignment.
B0039HBP4G|2|no instructions, never did get them to go around my seats, ended up throwing them in the back of the jeep ...
B005N6Z3YO|4|I really liked  this!  And  so did  my  boyfriend.  The  material is  on  the  thin side..  But  it's  really  made well.  I wasn't too sure what  size  to  get...  Because  after looking at  other  reviews about  it  running  small.  I was a little  nervous.  I order a 2x, but I can see it  running  a Lil bit small, in  some  areas.  But it fit nicely on  him.  He  is  6 ft and  weighs  roughly  around 260 ibs.  He  was able  to  button the  vest with  no  problem.  Plus  for what  it's  worth,  I couldn't  pass it  up!  I would order  more stuff  like  this  in  the  future!  And  maybe  I'll  order  a 3x...  To  see the  difference.  But  overall,  I'm  pretty satisfied with it,!
B00Y3U5A6C|5|The attention to detail is amazing. Protection where you need it and more storage than you'd hope for. Jacket is well made. Shoulder and elbow protection is superior. Comfortable. Well suited for riding.
B0012PQBVE|5|was  good fit and easy to install
B002J8UPO2|5|Love this
B011K4OSXE|5|Just what I needed no complaints here. It works perfectly.
B00HR26SNW|5|LEDs look great. Installation was easy.
B000LNQIXE|5|Worlds best lube...
B00BD4SKXG|5|Excellent for the price
B005NBS4RC|5|Looks great and very easy to put on.
B003WDDLTO|5|Perfect fit to keep a trickle charger on my bike all winter
B0010B00IA|4|Bought one for my parents, too!!  Does a good job if you load it with ice packs and cold drinks.
B013TY03ZU|5|Looks nice in my 2015 Silverado LT.....arrived early n perfect condition..A+ all the way..
B005JU5W54|5|Easy-swap. Wipes off the chunkiest of bugs if you squirt 'em right away.<br />We'll see how they hold up.
B002R7SAHY|4|GREAT!!!!
B00009RAX7|1|Like a few other reviews I've seen, mine is dead.  It did work for about a year, but it no longer powers up at all. I'm getting another, but it won't be  an Actron.
B00HLW18T2|5|The LED flood lights are exactly what I was looking for and then some. They are so good and at a great price I am looking for a reason to buy 2 more.  I am sure I will find something. These are going on the front of my pontoon boat. Let there be light!
B00MIA2T0Y|1|The item fits very well, but it smells like it was soaked in gasoline or something.  We can't even keep it in the car.  More or less useless
B005ASY23I|4|Does what it needs to do. It has a long enough cord and hose to reach all of the tires. Lost one star for not including a carrying case for it.
B008HAMULM|5|This tail bag IS well made. The two d-ring style web straps / with clips allowed me to quickly mount it to my motorcycles rear rack (however) the straps secure the bag left to right (against sideways movement) only.  There is NO attachment d-ring or straps, etc... on the side closest to the seat to prevent rearward movement; I corrected this with a bungee cord that I wrapped around my mustang seats drivers backrest. The bag IS worth every penny. But long term users and commuters would be wise to create a plate that fits inside this tailbag that allows them to bolt it to the rack for a permanent fix. Oh by the way - looks great with my Mustang studded solo saddle and Viking saddle bags. 9/17 still love the bag, did get a little moist inside after a torrential rain but if I would have looked River Roads has a rain cover sewn into a zippered pouch on the bottom of the tail pack.
B00C0SQ8KG|1|Quit working moisture has got inside and no direct water contact, needs to be sealed alot better unhappy!!!!
B000NZOH7E|3|They are good quality.  They do not stay in place though.
B00DUGZDNU|5|Completely satisfied
B00FEB5MZ8|5|Looks great!
B011J0DPRE|5|Great
B00D9BFR8M|5|had clips and elastics so it wont fly off your bike
B00P6MQUG0|5|Fit well and arrived fast
B000VU56TO|5|I ordered this for my husband's new Ram 2500 long bed truck and he was very pleased with it. Fit like a glove exactly what he wanted. Nice and heavy. Arrived the day after I ordered it. Wow! Couldn't be happier.
B003V9VZBK|5|Nice boxed set to keep everything together.
B0077Z6K2I|1|ordered two...both smelled like they were on fire, one actually started on fire, sent both back
B00IWNUMAA|5|Solved my intake leakage with minimal cost.  Worked very very well.  Did take a while to install.
B000WOALM6|3|I ordered and XL, when I originally looked at it, it said 21&#34;, when I get to the friend's house and see it, it's smaller than that (about 17&#34;). THEN to beat it all, it shows (now anyway) that the MED is 21&#34;. He had already started using it or I would have returned it, he is using it UNDER another one to add height to his seat until we find one that fits him and the bike right.
B007LIA8JM|1|Too small for my Prius.
B007H2RR78|5|I tightened the ends like the instructions say to and it works great with no leaks. I was a little worried about it fitting in my bumper because of the reviews I read, but it fit with no problems!
B007PMY3MM|4|Nice looking but not as well padded as I would've liked.
B00DBNF756|5|Very sticky! I put these on a set of replacement Wheel Covers and it's hard to tell they are fake. Good quality product. The glue is so sticky that you better make sure they are lined up the first time because you probably won't get them off. My only request is that they make a black background version of these so they can be like the originals. But I'm glad I got these because these stickers coupled with some aftermarket wheel covers made my car look new again and I paid less than I would have for a SINGLE wheel cover from Chevy.
B00F8LEB9W|5|these are great  and very easy to program
B00W2XF1AM|3|Did not fit very well and adhesive is not as good. Older style I had fit much nicer. Got what I paid for.
B000TV59EC|5|Its toilet paper that does what it is supposed to.  Not that flimsy.
B00666G8Q2|4|Installed on a 2011 KLR 650. Initial bite is very similar to stock, perhaps a little stronger. Low dust and seem to wear well after a couple thousand miles.<br /><br />Note: when new, initial bite will be far greater than stock. This will level off after a thousand miles or so. Could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what you're looking for.<br /><br />Cannot speak whether they are wearing the rotors faster or not just yet.
B00PEZZSNU|5|2002 Avalanche fits perfectly
B008FXN0VK|5|One of the best tool sets I've ever used. Add these to your tool collection today!
B00UHD4HJA|5|Stickers were as described, well worth the price
B001KSGJ42|5|PERFECT
B0073J979Q|5|Works well.
B0002SQUTU|5|Every brake tech needs one of these.  Note, for large dual piston setups, you will need to keep the inner pad in place to have enough throw to fully retract the pistons.
B001PWFPRU|1|Product sucks don't buy. Didn't fit my ram1500. So tight it scratched off the paint then broke.
B0016H0O6G|4|east to install.
B0055PD1H4|5|love
B000Q71N8K|3|Works well if inside at temps around 70.
B00M0DHCJC|5|Great product and on time
B00N52LO2I|5|The material is a bit cheap but the price is right!  The nose area does not seal completely, but again, they looks fantastic on.  Love it, and excited to use them at Burning Man!  Thank you!
B00HJEGQQ2|1|These will not fit the Harley-Davidson Iron 883. Ive tried putting them on mine and the base is way to thick to be pushed down and set correctly.  Light came apart as i twisted it in. Very disappointed as its advertising specific for Harley.
B00HAPHCQI|5|Very good part**** and excelent, service**.
B00CD7E0U4|5|fit perfectly and priced great
B001KWAIAY|5|Nice box. Heavy gauge steel so it's kinda weighty even when empty. But hey, whadaya expect when the steel is thicker?
B005SEJTUA|5|Works great in my 05 Tiburon GT with 210k miles! I can't see myself using anything besides Royal Purple or Redline fluids anymore. The extra $10-$15 over conventional synthetic (Mobil 1 and all that) is worth it. I can actually feel a difference.
B00G8JCSCA|5|Noticed a marked difference in the engine performance with the chip. Now driving is much fun in low gears and overtaking is amazing, I did not notice any marked difference in mileage. Installation is easy and can be done in 5 minutes. Drove around 4000 Km so far and has no issues of any kind
B000BZ6UBW|5|No more grinding noise. these bearings are great bought one for each side smooth as butter now 2006 Hyundai Tucson 2.7 front wheel drive would definitely purchase again this is the only brand of bearing that I buy at this price you can't go wrong
B00379ABX2|5|Came on time wish was little bigger letters..
B0058XLVI4|5|They were great ... Good and fast mailing it to me very happy
B00GTXS3M4|4|The fan inside is too loose with nothing holding it. At least it looks good.
B00IXC3HJS|5|as described, work great.
B009AAJJOO|5|A-1
B005NLQAHS|5|I use this inexpensive unit with the free Torque app on my android smart phone. Works great. Saved me an expensive trip to dealer to fix reported problems. Turned out to be a bad vacuum hose that the dealer would have charged a couple $$hundred to diagnose. I should have bought it a long time ago. For the price you can't go wrong.
B000C3BB6M|5|WORKS
B00AFWOCUW|5|no problems
B0010DQMH6|5|Works Great and costs much less than what I would have paid at the dealer
B00BJ9J7V4|5|Works great for my cars! Love the coconut smell
B000BZG8ZU|4|Works as a downstream O2 sensor for the 05 elantra hatchback. The connector is not attached- there is pretty much a splicer that you use to attach to your old clip to the new sensor, so make sure when you install you leave a little extra length when cutting the old wire. Otherwise you'll end up struggling to hold it in place when you put in the splice.
B00L4TF32G|5|Much better than other brands and very little residue to collect dust!
B00HZSNV4C|5|It works for me! I had carpenter bee gunk on the side of my motor home that had been there for months and after spraying Bugs n all on it came off easily and I didn't use a microfiber cloth either
B0007TQWME|2|Very thin gloves.  Tear easily.
B000GTXD4K|5|always love them
B00WH6ZBE0|4|Heavy duty, but had to modify it a bit.
B004FHD5AQ|5|Absolutely makes using my placard easy.
B000CQ4BAW|5|Husband likes it.
B007DCH5SS|5|So awesome and cute, personally i love it a lot and really my ony complaint is it took a long time to arrive
B0018JF04S|4|Not a bad exhaust but did not fit perfect as expected from an exhaust that costs as much as it does.  I had to drill out the holes for the studs so it would bolt up.  Also is not very much louder/throatier sounding than stock.  The person that said this exhaust is noisey is lying.
B00B9IVRCW|5|I was hesitant when I purchased this item.  Some reviews stated that they had to finish wiring the ground in order to work, but I had no problems in the installation and operation of the Jack.  Some complained that it was slow, but it is ok in my opinion.  Just remember that the up and down switch relates to the A Frame and coupler, not the Jack itself.
B00N44WLXS|5|Works exactly as described on my Mazda CX-5. Just make sure the wires are correctly connected. I soldered mine for a long life.
B0001CLC8G|4|The part fit great and was not damaged  surprisingly from the condition the box it was shipped in
B00D8L5WII|1|Did not include decoder harness as stated in description.
B000MWIHTC|5|Easy Install, looks good!
B00FM7B1AO|5|Installed (by professional) very quickly and easily. Does exactly what it says in the book. However, there is some dispute about whether it qualifies for the Ontario discount because it is no longer on the list of approved units in Ontario.
B003MS29MO|5|Use it for my Porsche 996, my Saab 9-5 and my son's BMW 325
B005KLVNJG|5|Great seller. Would repeat buy again.
B005WQ7BX6|5|After having this on our 2015 JK for a little over a week, so far it seems like a very nice system.  Appears to be very well made and fitment was extremely easy.  Sound is slightly more aggressive than stock and grows with RPM.  So far no noticeable highway drone, which was very important to us.  Definitely feel vehicle is more responsive in 6th and generally.  Running 34's with Rockstars, stock gears, Banks CAI, Votice TBS, with a 6spd manual.
B00FALVU8A|5|This is great wax for the lazier ones, including me. You can wax while the car is still wet after rinsing, and you can buff it off immediately. You don't need to wait for it to dry. It works really well, and even has a nice scent to it (I want to say it's honeydew). It might not work as great as more traditional waxes, but it's so easy to use that you can add a coat or two with every wash. I don't know about you, but I tend to not want to spend 1 or 2 hours with traditional waxes to add 2-3 coats on my car, so this product is perfect for me.
B003S1RQ2S|5|I bought this to replace the battery in a string trimmer.  It fit perfectly and has functioned as well.  A good deal.  It was a reasonably priced substitution for the expensive OEM.
B001U8KNQM|3|Love front seat cover.  Not sure how to put on back seat covers
B00G4L1T8Q|5|For a halogen application it's very good and lights up the road much better.
B00EUU7IUQ|1|doesnt fit
B000RFSARI|4|Good.
B00O92MZVW|5|Looks great. Good quality.
B004947IX0|5|It met my expectations and I will strongly  recommend it to others.
B0007TQWM4|2|One of the materials it states it is not suitable for was the one we needed to repair.  Returned it.
B00CZEZNGU|4|received quick and is what is advertized
B011IN7LE0|1|Did not fit my 2015 Honda Civic! Very disappointed in this product. It didn't have the &#34;curves&#34; suitable for the civic. These are flat.
B00A4542H8|5|This stuff is amazing, best car wax I have ever used, head and shoulders above the rest!
B00F9RNIPI|5|Well made.  Comes with a bag, gloves, and a wire brush.  Will be perfect for my wife's vehicle.

B00HNLDGMS|5|I LOVE THIS STICKER, I BUT IT ON MY REAR WINDSHIELD AND IT LOOKS GREAT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A QUALITY STARK INDUSTRIES STICKER
B00TL2V36S|2|Although the automated feature in Amazon confirmed that it fits my car, it does not fit well.<br />The issue is that the pins do not fall in position well as they are not either the right pin or too short.
B001U6DMSK|1|Not good
B00KLKW3S6|5|Great service, great price.  I'll use Zoom Zoom parts again!

B006BDYJJI|5|Wow!! Very very easy to set up i only paid $2.00 to get cut. Arrived sooner then expected will definitely buy again!! Im happy i didnt pay $95 like i was quoted from locksmith
B0045T4PP8|4|They are super cute they are flat they look wonderful however they are hard to put on.
B000GVH20E|5|The Dowco Iron Rider Main Bag worked very well on my Can Am Spyder.  It fit the seat very well, held most of my clothes for my months' travels and using two bungee cords I was able to keep it on the bike without moving.  It even gave me a backrest when I'd lean back.  I had to learn how to tuck the rain cover underneath so things on the bottom didn't get wet but once I had it figured out, it was great.  We had 3 days' worth of constant rain on the start of the trip so I had a chance to learn how to travel with it.  A great investment for my travels.
B000IYBJDK|5|OEM LOVE IT..
B007S0H5DU|4|Works great, no issues all summer.
B00VSC0EAA|5|Amazing sticker. Worth every penny.
B00KJ8IILG|5|I used these on my Polaris Ranger 900 XP they are fantastic! Super bright and easy to install. Everything needed was included, even had install items I didn't need.
B00BH0UD1I|5|It fits perfect and looks great on my 2006 TOYOTA Corolla S. Thanks
B004VG88MQ|2|much thinner than i expected.
B001C64BM4|5|Works fine no noise
B012DG24G6|5|Decal is great. Means a lot to me. Great communication from seller
B009ELOCSW|5|They work. I hope they last. What else can I say?<br />(used for a Toyota Yaris 2009, sedan, brake lights)
B00B2FCCDK|5|worked well.  Great deal.  Timely shipping.  Thanks.
B000COBXPA|5|On time and as advertised.
B0009IQZH0|1|Not absorbent at all! Used it to on my motorcycle and was very dissatisfied. Recommend buying a different microfiber towel
B003TPDJEW|5|Perfect!
B00NSEMN14|5|Good product easy to install
B001QU9NC4|2|Didn't fit right
B00Z2CY2LO|4|Did the job it was supposed to do.
B00C0UA88W|5|Worked and had no issues with it.
B007ZG97WY|5|This product exceeded all my expectations. Great quality and price.
B005XZXB1M|5|Installed this in my Toyota FJ Cruiser to help keep my transmission temp cooler while towing....works as expected and was easy to install.
B0031GVTPA|5|Perfect fit for my 2008 Ford Explorer!
B00XKY89AG|5|Product us as described.  Would've liked Velcro gripping on bottom but hope weight if products inside it during transport will keep it from sliding around
B003S7454O|3|Acceptable and average. Not easy to install and tighten. Have not had enough experience to rate further at this time
B00KTI0E6I|5|Worked out great !
B00WO3O584|5|These look exactly like the real deal, but the inards are different and I would not recommend buying these if you think that you can just take the mother board out of these to replace the one in your factor FOB. But the price is perfect and the dealership was easily able to add them to the list of accepted FOBs on my truck computer.
B0085I1DL4|5|Super fast shipping and easy to install
B0002Z9L7G|5|It keeps my seat belt away from my neck and driving has been so much more comfortable!
B005HINTGC|5|Cheap fast and it work out just fine....
B008UX68OQ|4|Needed holes for antennae.
B001FANR54|5|The appearance is great, better than expected. Installation was extremely easy. Good solid product and well worth the money.
B00513G82U|5|great trunk if you make your own bracket and put carpet inside and know it is a $70. item.<br /> expect paint runs and shoddy welds<br />I added chrome trim and reflectors to  make it match bike<br />holds a helmet and all my other stuff very pleased
B004RCUR8M|5|This kit is awsome!! Works great! I installed this on a travel'r electric awnkng. The only conplaint i had was that the wires coming off the control module/sensor are not the right lengths. One set of wires way longer than need to be, other set a little to short. But not a big deal. Ibe installed it works as promised. A gust that moves the the awning arms more that a few inches and it automatically retracts. Such peace of mind!! Worth the price.
B006P88TJ0|5|Eye catching on my Leather!
B009NRBBD6|3|High quality. Just make sure you check the rear line bung and how tight it is to the housing before installation.
B002ESXJEU|5|fit JUST as I was hopin plannin for it to  -- works fine  :)
B001BB6FLU|2|It works but not very well
B000HBIB80|5|Showed up late
B000VB0FCQ|5|Seems to be of good quality. No problems yet. Cheapest engine gasket set I could find for a Dodge 5.9L.
B00JA1C4MM|5|Perfect fit to my 2002 subaru impreza rs2.5 NA. Comes with everything you need and they only took me about an hour to put on. Good price and they sound badass. Subatu rumbles for days!!!! Love them
B0091LY95G|5|just what I needed for my new bug
B009DIWHKQ|5|fit perfectly, it actually looks like a better part than the factory filter.
B00QTDWPW8|4|These motors worked well. It took a couple of tries to get them to read accurately and were not easy to solder onto the circuit board but they worked fine once installed correctly.
B009S2ZQNM|3|Just broke this morning, lasted almost a year. I know my door hangs just a bit so I won't knock it, wish it was tougher but its got to be better than the plastic ones. Yes, I'm ordering another one.
B00HRGTXDU|5|great sticker
B00IO3KQPO|3|there isnt much back support but it definitely makes driving easier.
B0032J1KAK|1|Quality so poor. I threw them in the trashcan.
B00JLJK55G|5|Part arrived quickly and fit my vehicle perfectly.
B000C0TG2G|5|good an it works on my car
B008ZI4XDY|5|just as advertised
B00AO3AEMC|5|Really nice riding glasses for the money!
B00JALAAHS|3|HID bulb doesn't always come on (you have to switch hi beam on first). Mounting tape provided failed after 2 days.
B006H819UO|4|Nice
B00ZEJGDT4|5|looks and works great
B008GVRI50|4|I have used the Yellow Jacket-it absolutely SUCKS.And I refuse to buy another.I bought a JB,its still under review.I have 2 Robinair removers that I have owned for over 10 years,that the only complaint is they lack the sideport (plus I lost the knob off of one.The Appion seems to be the best on the market so far.
B00GJKXW8M|4|Great little light for the money. Saw same one at Northern  Tools for over 50.00. Use as backup light, used magnet to mount under receiver hitch, lights it UP.
B008CE0TN4|5|Great
B00Q683YZS|5|Great Light!!
B001C9XZWS|5|Perfect fit - saved a bunch - easy to install
B002J7VX4Y|5|Smells like new plastic not as much of a new car scent. But is still good and last longer the pine tree air fresheners.
B000L7JQE8|4|Works good but not as heavy duty as expected - good for light duty
B00NB7I0UQ|3|It's small, which is what I needed so that I can still put my stand up paddle board on top of the roof racks without having to remove the antenna every time, but the reception only improved from a 2/10 to maybe a 6/10. Still lots of static but better than it was.
B00P8FFTQ2|5|Fast delivery and was just as stated in ad
B00K0EMTPK|2|Bought this awhile ago. Due to an accident, not on my bike by the way, I have not been able to install my new tail light. When I first received it I did not pay attention to the fact the description said no instructions will be provided. Contact the seller, did not receive much help from them about how to properly install the two yellow wires coming out of the back which operate the built-in turn signal. The only reason why I bought this aside from the cheap price, was the turn signal. Don't want to give me much help with the install, kool I'll figure it out. Come to find out the damn thing won't even bolt up to the fender mount...brand new lens and it won't bolt up...FML...attempt to use the old lens I got, modify the chrome plastic and wire up the light and I'm good to go!...Nope, plug it in, turn on the bike it lights up as it should. Squeeze the brake lever or step on the brake and the damn license plate light is the one that lights up brighter not the red light. I'm gonna contact the seller one more time hopefully with a much greater review to give.
B007XUHTQ8|5|It was installed about 6 months ago.  Fit perfectly on our Honda and has performed flawlessly.
B00M9NP772|5|James is always great
B00MVMMIA0|5|Using them to brighten up our RV Working great so far
B00A8MZ7EY|5|You can't go wrong with CG products and this one is no exception. The clay is for small to medium buildup, or if your car hasn't been clayed in a while. Use a razor blade or straight edge to cut a bit off on the longer side (don't forget to remove the paper before actually using the clay). The lube works perfect if you spray it on the vehicle and on the clay before claying. It also has a pretty decent smell. I highly suggest using gloves since the clay will want to get really tacky on your skin and it will also end up drying out your skin too. Just one cut of clay can be used for a good portion of the vehicle. I did my Audi A7 with three cuts of clay. This can also be used on glass, plastic, headlights, and mirrors.<br />- Enough clay and lube for more than one use<br />- Lube smells good<br />- The medium duty clay is easy to knead<br />- Got rid of stubborn black scuff marks on my paint
B002P8R58U|4|the back will not snap on. I need help??
B006VU5WX8|5|Thanks
B001KO0TO2|1|While I thought this was a good idea to replace and go with straight rotor replacement to fix Ford's F UP, the bearings are shot after only 5k miles.    Now I am stuck with buying a new set since the bearings are integrated.    Not Happy at all
B00HZ54H66|1|I installed this wrap easily enough following the directions but now my pipes burn the crap out of my pants and leg!  This wrap does not insulate nor keep more heat inside.  The wrap lets tons more heat out and right into your thigh, foot and ankle.  My motorcycle does not run better nor hotter anywhere, just hot as heck on my leg.  Ouch!  I'm uninstalling the wrap now and back to my stock heat shields.  It did start to turn white at the corners as well so this stuff does not last long.  Skip it.
B00JH0O3DY|5|Great belt at a great price!
B00495UQT2|5|Excellent
B007KPERVG|1|1 star for not sending bottom lights and not sending and correcting problem.
B0080HJL7S|5|It's small but I'm ok with that. You don't want a huge garbage bag in your car. I put in on the passengers side so I can reach and throw trash away in it. It's nice to throw away left over coffee too and not have to worry about it leaking or ruining it. Its super easy to clean. I just rinse it out!
B00HLADQN0|5|good
B004T7Y5EW|3|They are ok. I was expecting them to have a better powder coating or paint on them. I have had them on the truck for 8 months and they have started to rust. I had to fabricate my own mounts because there is not really a good way to mount them to the rocker panel without ripping the sheet metal. Probably would not buy them again.
B00BWDQ0JO|5|Arrived fast & product is amazing, better than expected.
B004XUHXC6|3|Not a big fan of this 3.0 style of having the outter shell be a second jacket.  I much prefer the original style and the Superego style of removable panels that zip off instead.  The mesh jacket underneath is nice and breathes well.  I wore mesh jacket on several 95+ days and it performed well.
B00SW8TJ8Q|4|Very well made light,  haven't installed yet so can't review how it works
B00VJ4LHUS|5|This is perfect for my car.  Keeps the garbage out of the way. I bought a standard box of ShopRite tissues and they fit perfectly and holds my water bottle nicely. The front even has a nice little net pouch for papers and things. Hangs neatly off the headrest of the passenger seat towards the front where I can reach it, but I can easily slide it to the back of the seat if I need to.
B003UNTHNK|5|It's a silky lanyard, jst the way I was hoping for
B0002Q81W6|3|Plug to small or block to big
B007HG7TFO|5|good
B003V8CW3Q|5|Love it! I thank you!
B000C9CC14|5|good job
B000CQOIQE|4|These issues is all you have always been good hitches high-quality and reliable.
B00TZF06VO|5|works great
B0119ZICB8|5|Dident take long to hook up and they look great! Very happy with the lights.
B0009IQZFM|5|great product!
B0030CJZW4|5|This was really easy to install, and I'm no expert.  So far it seems to be working just fine.  Hopefully it holds up for a while.  And to think some auto shop would have charged my wife more than $300.  Glad I convinced her that I could do it for a lot less.
B000FA91DC|5|Perfect fit and easy install.  Would've been nice had it included instructions, but there are enough instruction videos online to make it easy.
B00D2TW86K|5|Nice quality thick gauge badge. Had to give it away - wifey wasn't havin' it..
B000E63MAA|5|Perfect fit 2002 trailblazer
B0108JPQ4M|5|It's worthy to buy it. Soft and comfortable
B008EEYWKI|5|I have 1999 Toyota Tundra 4.7L V8 with 225,000 miles on it, I know that that's nothing compared to other areas of the country but for where I live, on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, that's consider  high mileage. Anyway this is not about my truck but about the product. This is my second time I have replaced the timing belt. The first time I only replaced the belt and the water pump, the pump fit perfectly but the belt, well, they sent the wrong belt! Sadly I did not order it from Amazon it came from another website.<br />But this time around I order this kit, Aisin TKT-021, from Amazon and it came with everything needed to get the job done and when they say &#34;exact fit&#34; they mean &#34;exact fit&#34; It went together without any problems which makes me a very happy customer and the next time, after another 100,000 miles, I will definitely order this kit again! :-))
B00BD6VVSA|3|Quality is not the best.
B00IN5X2P4|5|Fits perfectly in our Highlander and color is perfect.
B00XM5R6YS|5|Awsome, well made. No junk here
B000CIZYRE|5|Works as it should! TOUGH as nails!
B00ABXW3LK|5|Rotors are holding up well.  We'll see in 20k miles.
B001HXZT14|5|They make great presents and last forever!
B011M66G5I|5|THIS BACK SET PROTECTOR WAS A SAVOIR IN MY CAR!  MY SON IS ALWAYS KICKING THE SEATS AND IS ALWAYS GETTING HIS FOOT PRINTS OR MUD ON THE SEAT AND DAILY I AM HAVING TO CLEAN IT... WITH THIS I DONT WORRY AS MUCH ABOUT HIM KICKING KNOWING THAT MY SEAT BACK IS NOT GOING TO GET FILTHY. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.
B00T9GNAYE|5|These work great. We had other lights but older. Had been wanting to upgrade for a while. If you purchase from a jeep magazine you will spend from $50 to $100 more. This is a deal.
B000E7SY02|1|HAVE HAD FOR 2 YEARS  AND THE 1 BIKE STRAP HAS A CRACK.  THE SECURITY CABLE END COME OFF.  TROUBLE CRIMP ON THE END.
B001C6OYYO|5|that membership i pay 99.00 for DO NOT RENEW.  I do not like the way your company used credit card without my ok.
B00563HXV0|5|Installed in a few minutes.  Strapped some pieces of fire hose to truck frame to keep frame from damaging tire.  Also I recommend installation of wheel master 82286S spare tire inflator to keep tire inflated.  Don't forget to put a piece of foam pipe insulation to stop the stainless steel hose from rubbing on the tire sidewall.
B005C2L618|5|Perfect replacement, much cheaper than local shops wanted!
B005LXDTNQ|5|Fit was perfect , looks like it came from the factory.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|bought a 2nd one for my friend. she also drives MDX. She loves it too.
B000H2EVYC|5|Installed on my 2000 Honda Civic Si (em1) and they look beautiful, and really stiffen up the ride. Used the Moog end links for connecting to the sway bar (also available on Amazon).
B0031P6B3Q|5|Worked as repair on popup...as expected
B00LF9A3KM|4|It helped make a  number of small scratches and dings become much less apparent.
B009VLG93Q|5|Perfect fit and absolutely love them.
B000XBBISO|5|This new version of the valve assembly has a plastic lower cap.  My original had a brass cap.  But it seems to work just fine
B00BKW444K|2|Cheap winch but would get a warn<br />for the long run
B006EGAIII|5|good product
B005TDN2KI|4|i am sure this would be great on a new xj axle ($400?).  I elected not to install as my original axle is a corroded, pitted, and galled piece, rougher than a cob where the seal would ride.  i determined i would rather water be able to flow in and out freely than be trapped in the axle tube.  however with the diff running at 185 degrees, maybe all the moisture would evap out.  i do not want to expirement.  they remain in the box.
B000BUQOGI|4|works great
B000VD5V5K|1|I ordered and received two. Both are literally unusable. The welded posts, on the bottom of the chocks, which (are supposed to) fit into the floor brackets, are not even close to being welded on flat and level. Not bent in shipping either, in fact you can't bend them into proper position, they are welded solid. One post won't even fit into the slot period. Remember, I ordered two, not like it's a fluke. Waste of time and effort. Going back immediately. They are made in China. A product that is totally unusable and has to be returned should be zero stars.<br />Update: Vendor excellent and quick with refund.  They seen all pictures, didn't bother with returning and issued credit.
B000A0EJD4|5|Excellent filter for the price!
B00K8VQJ9M|5|Smells amazing!
B000W5U8O6|5|Adds style and DOT requirements all in one!!!
B00HQQZI1W|5|Adds even more class to an already classy SUV.  Just Exactly what I was looking for!<br /><br />Thank You for making such an accessary, and at a great price may I add.
B0044B0Y9S|5|very good
B00LHB08C6|5|I get comments on these no matter what drive thru I am in  :)
B00B0C14F2|5|The brakes work great (at least the fronts do). I couldn't justify spending thousands on upgrading brakes, and Power Stop seems to deliver as advertised! They're definitely a huge improvement over the stock brakes, but at a fraction of the price of the &#34;big brake&#34; kits that routinely sell for $2K and up. However, make sure you follow the manufacturer's recommended break-in procedure - though it may call for a trip to a large empty parking lot, or off-hours at the local forest preserve.  Plus, make sure that the parts you order are compatible with your car. I highly recommend calling Power Stop's customer service to double check before ordering on Amazon. One two different occasions, Amazon indicated that a certain kit was compatible with my car, only to find out from my mechanic (who twice had my car on the lift) that it wasn't. And for those of you who aren't familiar with brake parts - the rotors aren't light, so shipping them back isn't what I'd call a piece of cake...  And just a warning for my fellow Audi A6 (C5) Quattro 3.0 owners looking to upgrade the brake - this K515-26 rear brake kit is NOT compatible with our cars. The correct kit, according to Power Stop is K4845-26 (which, oddly, is nowhere to be found in stock anywhere on Amazon).
B0002MAANI|5|Works great. Arrived on time and very quick.<br />Little hard getting out of the case it comes in. Wish I could have choose a shorter length strap.<br />But over all it great.
B000AMLWH8|5|Best detailer for leather seats.  It cleans but does leave that extra shiny residue behind.
B005HAYDR4|4|Works well, stays in place, and can hold my 200lbs just fine.
B00EEQKRSG|5|They shipped it without the installation hardware. But a quick email to them got me the missing parts. Easy to install and looks sweet in the rig.
B00CHT6KII|5|Fits OK. With the liner out it breathes bettet than my other Bilt mesh jacket. Would recommend.
B00173U7D4|5|This spray really does the job. I bought this for our camp site that had a sort of outhouse. Thank goodness for this spray. It worked miracles.
B00KQXKG46|5|Good light and better price. I used it for my Polaris Ranger and the light gets wet and banged into a lot of trail shrubs and bushes and still works great.
B00IN4JJCU|5|Good
B0009VIQ1A|5|Don't be fooled by imitations, get only the Original California Duster. Great product for all these ears.
B008I6742A|5|Love these side mirror covers....put them on myself after watching a YouTube video on how to do it with no problems at all.  Have had many compliments on how these look on my MINI.
B000WK3P4Q|5|They fit perfect and now I don't go through belts like I did before.
B0081IOF5Y|4|Great!
B00A6AS6LY|5|This thing kicks a*s. Used it to bleed the air out of my 2002 Civic EX.....twice.
B000WJ75J8|4|Velcro straps should align perfectly for that price. It is simply a custom fit duffle back. The zipper could stand to be more sturdy too.
B004EK0E5S|5|Perfect fit.
B0013FU4O8|5|Good
B000OUXAGM|5|Love it
B00EELM7PM|5|Awsome product!! Great price and they look amazing!! $ Strongly reccomend!!!
B00LAFJ09Q|1|Amusing until you try to remove this &#34;magnet&#34;. In the 6 months this adhered to the surface of my car and I can't remove it with a plastic scraper and blow dryer. The STUDENT DRIVER magnet that I bought<br />and applied on the same day came right off
B00CRR5L8U|5|good and fast
B002YLRN30|1|This this is an utter disappointment. It left me and my wife stranded with a dead battery and it could not get the car started at all! What is the use of this if it can't serve it's main function and purpose?
B00CF13SP6|4|LIKE LIKE LIKE I use it to hang the keys on my purse so I don't lose them and this isn't bulky nice and dainty size!
B000Z0HVHA|5|Heavy duty,good quality,
B0031I2SOY|5|Very nice surface for braked to stop on. No fade or shake
B0000C6FOM|4|Instructions for mounting should recommend mounting guides with boat on trailer.  I tried it with them off and ended up having to reinstall.  Otherwise great product.
B000C31J9G|4|Does its job.  It is a typical, reliable Fram product.
B007LICJ0S|5|Looks great on my car!!!!!
B00FQWUGU6|4|nice shine on top of the chrome water pump
B004J325FC|5|This is a good full carb kit. Freedom Country cuts NO corners when it comes to their products they sell.
B000IYLDFY|5|Good product
B0042VTYXM|5|nice
B004XJ0EF0|4|Was able to adjust my car seatbelt to a comfort level instead of it riding high on my neck.  It would be a lifesaver in an accident.
B009FUF6DM|4|Less sturdy than some, but good for the uses I planned.
B00NLMJS3E|4|I had to take to guardian to have it programmed but works good
B0012TZ22E|3|Can't say that I noticed any reduction in smoking when using this in a 2 cycle Kawasaki jet ski.  However, I have no way of really quantifying the amount of smoke.  I can only say that it is quite evident and does not seem to be of lesser amount than that produced by the oil I removed and replaced.
B000Z0HVHA|1|Dead on arrival  . . . . .
B0134PT0ZS|5|Fit great in my 2015 f150 fog lights. Great color in the 6000k.
B00NLPQ5L4|5|Fits perfectly on my camaro!
B00TY78AAM|4|Finally bought my first car all by myself (not new, but nice used). Since it is a 2009 with a bit of wear, and also since I have two dogs aka kids, the seats are a tad dirty, but otherwise in good condition.  I've been looking, and looking, and looking for seat covers.  The ones that are custom, I can't afford.  The ones that are cheap, are crappy looking.  And the cheap ones that I actually like are &#34;known to the state of CA to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive issues&#34;.<br />These seat covers are actually a pretty nice/thick material and were relatively easy to install.  And by 'easy to install' that would be if you factor in several adult beverages, lots of patience, and help from your favorite Holstein.  I kid, I KEEED...he just laid there and watched me the whole time, I mean the nerve!  Anyhooo...they look nice and cover up all the stains on my seats, they were affordable, and they actually take me back to my hippie days - I keep telling my husband I feel like I'm in the Cheech and Chong Mo-Beel.  But I digress.  The purpose of this product is to cover your car seats in a reasonable fashion and at a reasonable price.  I'd say accomplished.  And with minimal, dare I say zero, cussing.  Ok, OK, OKAY, not actually zero cussing, but definitely subdued.  And an added feature that everyone fails to mention is the mild to moderate (depending on car model/stress level/outdoor temperature/level of OCD-ness) work-out you'll receive while installing.  I'm not sure if my 15 minute Betty Rocker Make Fat Cry 30 Day Challenge was more intense than this or not, but I was sweating throughout both.  I guess bottom line is this...good product for a good price.  Thanks Bell!  Peace, Love, and Bright Blessings!  (PS, don't pay attention to my public name...a few months ago I was going to write a review on a personal product, but then decided against it...haven't changed my username or whatever it's called...don't even know if that's possible)
B000X3EWF8|5|FANTASTIC PRICE FOR THIS HIGH END BREAK. TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL MECHANIC AND HE INSTALLED WITH NO PROBLEMS. I ACTUALLY LOVE THE SOFT BRAKE COMPARED TO THE HARDER STOCK BRAKES.  WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN, YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS BRAKE PAD
B000UVUAFO|2|I was sort of disappointed. Maybe I expected too much, and some of the scratches were pretty deep. I did just as well with a mild compound and wax.
B00IJP5972|5|All went well with my purchase
B002SINC02|5|Great travel blanket. Fleece is soft, Built in zipper bag is handy, too.
B00V92PGS4|5|Was just what I wanted.
B00QJWUPC6|5|Love the headlights fit great very bright beautiful color great headlights
B00L7TMHT0|1|Not waiting for original , Its not even good quality  . Simply i had been cheated.
B00UBT5ANC|5|Great product
B000COMX3Q|5|Worked great.  The only product i found that had 5 of them.  Needed one for the spare.
B00L4GFGZS|4|Product as stated. No issues with product. Thanks.
B00PJPHEBO|2|It doestn work on japanese cars.
B000C5FL84|5|Replace gas cap sensor came on works prefect
B000RSTXG2|5|Cool
B00FY7M38Q|5|Beyond Happy Absolutely Lovee It , Fits Perfectly In My Car & Came Before The Delivery Date .
B00OYG44HG|5|Very well made; only issue I have, is trying to figure out where to mount this thing.
B00M9WL6WI|5|i have a 2013 Ford Explorer and this one fits perfectly. Having big hands (just a little), this cover made a huge difference. My current steering wheel already has leather but diameter was too small for me which made it hard to grip it. With this cover, it feels so good now. So much better grip and so much more comfortable to hold it. If you have an Explorer and big hands, highly recommend you get this.
B007RW2XYA|5|This filter fit my RAV4 2013  thanks
B00545NHWY|1|Cheap!  You get what you pay for.  I use for tie downs on excavating equipment which for DOT must meet certain spec.  These have the proper markings on them but they are very weak.  I have had them break at links 3 times.  Sorry I bought them and will buy AMERICAN next time.<br />I only gave one star because it wont let you give none.
B004I12438|5|This fit my 2005 Dodge caravan perfectly and looks like OEM. I am really impressed with this product. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who has broken taillight. It is better than the $119 the dealer quoted me for a new OEM product.
B00DVU0WYA|1|made of plastic did not fit properly and lost 4 in the first 3 weeks and 4th broke when trying to put it back on!!!!!
B005BNF8XA|5|Good bright that when you turn on the interior light. Previously it was conveniently have a small flash looked at the room.
B00BGYCF5C|5|silly thing. but I like it!  makes it easier for me to find my keys in my dark purse. lol
B00BCT2L4Q|5|Installed easily held 2 kayaks and a canoe without any problems. Very unobtrusive when collapsed.
B000EQB6NU|5|Fits our  Grand Cherokee Perfectly.  Great value.
B007630BFI|5|Great for those who like the show
B008LPEZ6Q|4|I found this to be pretty good, it smells nice and leaves a dull finish on my dash that I like. It does tend to collect dust a bit more than other products that I've used.
B000JZ9T4O|4|awesome for the price
B004AG612G|5|great for the money.
B00IJ4T7DK|4|Pretty simple installation.  Nice product
B00BGZ03TQ|5|Perfect fit for my 2014 Juke key fob.  Love it.
B003NHEPEE|2|not too happy broke easy
B002HEOMF6|5|Quality product and quick delivery.
B0055AWA9O|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B000CQOIVO|2|Its OK, but does not lift the camper up as high as we need it to in order to hook it to our truck.
B000C9QX50|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B008SEBQ2G|5|The Stubby looks great with its low profile, and works just as well as the stock antenna.
B008KPYYQ8|5|Just like original !
B000QV0HVU|5|Easy Install, Nice to have my 4X4 back! Color was maybe a shade off but since the truck is 22 years old I would think it has probably faded a bit in the sun. No complaints!
B00IYYW5CU|5|Awesome, its pretty much rewinding the clock back to when car was new
B00M9D9638|4|Very bright for their size
B00HRSTRAW|5|Went right in and it looks way better than the factory. a must buy.
B00519V8U6|5|Perfect
B0002KKTFO|5|I just used this grease grease gun to grease all five zerks on my 4WD Tacoma. I'm new to grease guns but found this very easy to use. If you're also new to grease guns, I recommend reading all the steps for loading grease use before loading grease (it'll make more sense when you do it).<br /><br />Tip: When attaching coupler to grease point, come in at an angle and then straighten. You'll feel the coupler connect.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Pistol grip makes applying grease with one hand very easy<br />Comes with 18&#34; hose and coupler for attaching to grease points<br /><br />Cons: None yet.
B001QGFWNM|5|Took all of 5 minutes to install. Super easy and work great. Couldn't be happier!
B002KCWWFC|5|It's grease, I used it in my truck. Umm, it's black. There's a plastic cap on one end (the bottom) and a metal tab on the other end (the top). The metal tab reminds me of opening a pack of tennis balls, but much greasier.
B002G9TMYS|4|they are just what i expected, should work fine.
B008G34P1I|3|The delivery was on time but it was poor quality in the lamps
B001LHVOVK|4|as advertised and came with another order on time.
B00E1JNU8U|5|this is one of the best accessories i have put on my bike, love it....thanks.
B001TJWH1G|5|This was a great purchase.  This drop in filter is only slightly higher than the stock filter and the design is great quality is great,  and the performance is amazing. I have had a inefficient stock filter for too long and I didn't want to spend $200-300 on a cold air intake.  Item showed up on time and was only slightly harder to install than an oem filter.  If you slightly wet the filter housing and gasket it will slide right in. make sure to dab off any excess water droplets.
B00F9LPIAC|4|Interesting
B00NX4SWGY|1|Black coating came off within a month I'm very picky with my car only I hand wash it so it wasn't exposed to any harsh cleaners or brushes in the wash and still didn't last 30 days in the trash now
B0006SU3QW|4|Dipped my car hubcaps. One can covered four wheels. I thought the nozzle had a poor spray flow, but maybe it's normal considering the viscosity of the product. This was my first time PlastiDip so I'm not sure.
B00DC6IVLO|5|Awesome and on time
B000CBQUBK|5|Works well
B000EQVYA0|1|My truck wouldn't start with this switch.  Took me about a day to figure out what was going on.  I made a video which explains the issue.<br /><br />https://youtu.be/U_QDTKX6ptE
B00LN7NH6I|5|Arrived on time and works well with my 07 odyssey. Dealership quoted me over $ 250 for fixing this ; Fixed it myself for less than $30!!
B00539X2GM|5|Fitted like a condom and not like an aftermarket ones and it works
B00KTIY6BW|5|I love it!  The only way I would have like it better is if it would have been purple, my favorite color.
B00N2E39C2|5|Fit great
B0023VOXIO|5|Fit exactly as expected!
B00ASMXEZI|5|Battery worked and had no problems with it.
B000CAINDE|5|perfect fit!
B000EVYGZA|5|Excellent for the money.  Nice options.
B009TRUFYQ|5|Absolutely love this sticker
B00V4477ES|1|I wish can put -10 , don't buy this .worse sticker ever.
B0066QV72M|5|MECHANIC I BROUGHT IT TO HAD NO ISSUES INSTALLING IT ON MY 2003 BMW 325I .... WILL PURCHASE AGAIN WHEN NEEDED
B00A2EATZ0|2|For startes I orderd color Camo and I received normal Camo. Also the throttle controle is horrible. If u set it down on a safe speed for a 8 year old child every time you stop the 4 wheeler dies. My front wheels are out of round, proble a .150 or better run out. Besides that, it does run good. I weigh 195 lbs and my daughter weighs 60 lbs. both of us can ride it together and the suspension holds up.
B009KT3D6U|3|Even with paint code matching, this paint color was nothing close to mine. It is possible the paint code in my car was wrong or had been changed, but it didn't make sense since from all my research the color was very close.
B012DUATK0|4|Great green color, not to bright though.
B0010DZZQA|5|Thought the A/C in my Rav4 was dying but it turns out my filter was really dirty.  A couple of bucks saved me hundreds and also gave us some needed relief in this hot summer weather.  It fit perfectly, the car smells cleaner, going to make sure I change it regularly from now on.
B00029XI2Q|5|Works like advertised
B000BZZRIY|5|Perfect
B00EA0ZB7I|5|great product and quick response
B00RCA2C3Y|1|Did not fit right kept in place by 3m tape that falls off first time they get wet pay the money get the good ones .
B000RL5QCO|5|Works great. Had to modify with longer bolts to fit my trailer, but there are so many different trailers that most of time you always have to do a little modification. But now the boat almost trailers itself.. .
B0067ECS6W|4|Started using on all my cars instead of buying Fram from walmart
B000FW2MC2|5|Put these between the seats on bare smooth aluminum and they stay put. Awesome cup-holders!!
B00OBGQUVM|1|looks horrible
B000B8GAOQ|5|love it so easy to operate
B00PPPNFYI|5|fit the Wrangler great!
B007REFW32|5|Nice.
B000C5SFSC|4|It doesn't say very clearly in the description but this comes with the gasket, I ordered one separately because I was unsure. This is a complete package,easy to install and works well.
B00BEZJ3TO|5|Exact fit and great service
B00NFA22XU|4|Nice product!! Bright, durable and nice color! Got what I expected.
B002Z34VJ6|1|This product is s***. It's plastic. Not carbon fiber.
B001TNBQ9Q|5|This worked perfect to level my 2014 f-150 fx4 after installing a 2 inch leveling kit on the front of my truck.
B00029JC6C|5|Perfect, came with everything I needed and was a bit cheaper on amazon than directly through Autozone/Advanced Auto. The regulator works great and keeps my psi just at 6 no matter the RPM or running temp. Very happy with the product, fixed the problem I had. I will say I had a problem with the mounting, it came with an extra set of bolt screws. Not sure if I completely failed mounting it or everyone else had the same problem? That being said a little bit of ingenuity made it work. I do recommend.
B00K1C1WC2|5|Good and light
B005JCY7RG|5|Fits perfect 2014 Chevy PU.
B00D329DI2|5|Worked like a charm.
B00ODFOCOS|5|Amazing cargo net.  Rugged, comes with all the necessary hardware and versatile in its use.  Im very happy with the product and the timely delivery.
B000C9SU1A|1|don't by these for a 2007 cadillac dts they do not fit. I bought 2 of these for my 07 dts with the code 9 engine and they do not fit threaded hole is to small. you need a pf61
B00B8B8RS2|2|It will work; however, the wholes did not line up perfectly and it was missing a couple bolt wholes.
B006LO6B7A|5|Great
B0002NIJPI|5|They were great . I'm happy with them
B00LV18KWM|2|Had some play in my hitch which I thought this would take care of it.  Would not fit in the gap.  Maybe better for large gaps
B00YEJ1LJ2|4|Fit could have been better. But they are functional and attractive.
B00B0Z4E1A|4|great product
B012HOJHV4|5|looks great and easy to apply. i love it !
B00OW0UAJA|4|I have bought several chrome key chains over the years and, sooner rather than later, the chrome flaked off.  It is too soon to tell what this one will do. The key rings appear to be steel, which is good.  The leather strap and metal ring holder seem to be well made, so we'll see.  It works for me.
B005SEK9IQ|5|I get this oil every time and it is a great deal, by a great company, giving a great product. Comparable to Mobil1.
8013826066|1|1 bulb went bad after 4 months vendor said 90 day warranty you spend this kind of $ on LED and they are supposed to last 10 times longer than an incandescent bulb, well these did not.
B0055B0E3M|1|Bad quality imo, they started to vibrate 10 month into. Warranty process was way over head.
B0013RIOMK|5|Looks amazing!! Really set the front apart from others. Took longer to remove from packaging than to install. Would recommend to anyone that wants to upgrade with minimal cost!!!
B008M4R914|5|Works great. No problems
B00I3U2ENK|5|Awesome upgrade. Nice fit and finish.
B0002SR7TC|3|Good pump. It work perfect in first use. When I use a second time the small hose is bend. Curt not straight. I got hard time and use more time to get all oil out. If the hose to put in dip stick flexible I will give 5 stars. Any way better than get under the car for sure.
B009GO5JXY|5|This item is so awesome someone stole it off our car.
B001U2DPUE|5|great DIY add on, boost free TV signal 100%
B000A3TA7G|5|Got them today and already installed them fit great look even better .
B00KGGTF9U|5|AWESOME!! - I have a Honda Pilot and it fits perfectly!! - Really nice product and high quality.  Would definitely order again and give a big thumbs up! (Oh - and fast shipping too!)
B008MVSUB0|2|Rattles a lot
B00425NBRI|5|Very easy to install this disconnect. I installed one on my camper and now have put them on several of my friend's campers because the loved having the ability to turn off the battery bank when not in use. Would work well for any 12v application that you don't want to leave on full time.
B00BV7CK90|5|Easy to install. I just had to drill out the old rivots. I'd definitely buy one again
B00B2FCQJK|4|As expected.
B0055HJFGI|1|Product was poor quality and did not fit my vehicle to my satisfaction. On a positive note, the seller refused the return, but issued a full refund on the purchase.
B00W4HGTO8|1|No good  no like
B0041CDPQO|4|I have a battery tender cable stubbed into the left saddlebag of my Goldwing.  This allows me to put a phone or anything else in that bag to charge.<br /><br />It also allows me to put something beefier on the battery, like a compressor, without fear of blowing the small fuses that are normally on an accessory line.<br /><br />***WARNING*** Since battery tender cables are usually hard wired (as mine is) to the battery, anything plugged into this will continue to drain your battery even if the bike is off and you've walked away.  I'm very careful with mine and only use it sparingly.  I usually leave something in the bag with it like my wallet which gets my attention real quick if I forget about it.
B007OZ2VC4|5|Thank you
B000S2PISY|5|Outstanding fit and quality. These brake pads are working perfectly! Would recommend them, and would purchase them again.
B002J7VX4Y|4|Yup...smalls like a new car...a little goes a long way
B000CPI6VI|5|If you tow various trailers, you need to have this in your kit.
B00HCQA8Q6|5|great product and price
B00G6IU99C|1|Didn't match, mis labeled
B000NZUQB0|1|First light rain and water penetrate in to both headlights
B00B2ATTYU|5|It was a perfect fit, just as described. also fast delivery.
B005PZMKZI|5|Not easy to install but once installed they have been GREAT!
B002L7H6Q6|5|Looks great....love it.....
B00JJZ1Q32|5|Purchased these for my 2003 Chevy Suburban, they are awesome. Very powerful lift action, easy install.
B003LS4X9C|5|Have one in every car I own. Cheaper in the long run than paper filters...
B00T3U1QRY|5|Put this on a 1981 Pontiac Firebird with a 4 core radiator, and 455 engine. On hot days in the city, the coolant temperature would climb up to 200 degrees even though it had a 180 thermostat. This fan keeps it down around 185-190 degrees when idling around town.<br /><br />The noise level is about what i expected. When the engine is running you can't hear the fan, but if you shut the car off and the fan stays on then it's noticeable. The Total airflow it moves is pretty fair, nothing crazy or anything, but it's enough.
B000EVYGZA|5|Best vo meter i have owned and I've had serveral.  Some were complaining about the 10 amp function not being fused.  Just put a fuse in line with your leads when measuring amps.
B00EN7JOQC|1|Before you buy, make sure you have an antique computer running windows XP or 7. Otherwise you can not register it. Secondly it defaults into  Chinese language.  It took me several day solve this one, but you can search youtube for a resolution. By biggest beef is after spending more than 20 hours and buying a cheap XP laptop just to register, I was not be able to download an upgrade. It does work on older cars and actually gets into the Airbag. ABS etc systems but mine refuses to do the basic OBD scan. The worst part is there is really no real customer service support available.<br /><br />I wanted to return it but by the time I jumped all the hoops, my return window closed so now I am stuck with a partially functional scanner. On the good side, I successfully diagnosed and deleted airbag light issues I had with a 2006 Volvo. It is not totally useless and the price is great
B004L7EVP8|5|Fits the 2012 Honda Odyssey EX. I wish the front piece was connected which goes in front of the driver and passenger seat, but these are durable. I like them. Very good price too. Easy install. Satisfied customer!
B00AS3TXWA|1|Very disappointed in these floor mats.  I'm an Uber driver and I bought these floor mats to protect my car from all the filth that is tracked by countless people getting in and out of my car.  The material is thin and flimsy.  The back floor mats slide around.  They do not grip the carpet in any way so they are constantly pushed up under the back seat.  The fact that they are molded to fit the floor is nice but because the material is thin and it slides...they are constantly moved out of place and the plastic ends up getting bent and misshaped.  Very unfortunate.  I expected much better for spending almost $200.  edit:  Tried super-gluing velcro to the bottom of these mats...  No luck.  Super glue doesn't stick to the material...
B006QZ7BYQ|3|Great product. Just wish it didn't take up so much storage space.  The dividers should be thinner so they spaces could be larger.
B006EGAIII|3|Second pair. Used them on gravel and the  plastic tore from the momentum of the vehicle driving up on them but rocks stopping the base. Not entirely confident after that but they'll be handy for smaller jobs. The return went extremely well but unfortunately when I told them my issue they senter a second pair where I would have rather skipped that and used a credit on amazon to purchase a different style
B00F2ZH9UW|5|Cant beat the price.
B002OUMVWY|5|Great
B00XQGUKZ0|5|Motor mounts were great for my 2007 pt cruuser, but our mechanic had an issue putting one of them on,  as it wasent for our turbo. But he fixed it and everything went great.  Thanks alot!  :)
B002R0MU9K|4|Worked fine
B000C34KUG|5|Arrived on time.  Changed easily.  Good quality
B004P1WM7Y|4|Easy to take on and off, just requires 2 people to do it efficiently.  Good purchase
B00B7QEULQ|4|Good quality,fits well
B00092893E|5|My car seemed to be dragging and slower to accelerate without punching the accelerator; but after giving it a boost with this product, I felt the difference in my 2004 SUV pretty quickly.  Highly recommend!
B00SDQPDKU|5|great sticker
B0038B4AQI|5|I like the look that gave my Honda Accord.  They are clear and looks smooth.
B00850N0BI|5|great sticker
B000TYTSRI|4|These look sightly different than OEM.  It doesn't bother me but may others.
B00MQM0KB4|5|This is a great towel. I wish they made a large bath towel size. It is super absorbent. Better than my chamois.
B003IHPR4G|5|Works just fine!
B00URDZFZU|3|End caps keep coming off mine...to cheap for long term use
B005AXSCZM|5|Great price on a direct replacement alternator for my TMD40A. I will buy another for my other engine to replace a subpar aftermarket generator.
B004ZGAABY|5|This was an exact duplicate of a discontinued air filter for my 1983 Kawasaki KZ750 K1 motorcycle.
B004ZC3TFC|5|So far, it seems to be working as expected.
B003G0KUI8|5|Good quality for the price, looks like it will last as long as I have the truck. perfect fit.
B00AXQ8G7U|1|Very disappointed, didn't even come off the adhesive side. Guess you get what you pay for.
B00029WR78|1|Installed on my 2004 Jeep Wrangler as it did not have a drain.  Followed instructions provided and leaked within a week.  Now, I have to take everything apart again which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place.  It'll probably cost me another transmission pan or the expense/inconvenience of having to have the hole welded - not to mention another half day crawling around on the garage floor.
B004FFEAJS|5|Suggest buying 3-4 sets as it makes the job much faster to complete.  But to not have to do this, buy premium ceiling fans, not he big box junk.
B0015PN010|2|Doesn't fit the ball joints on my Chevy S1500.
B00LOR74BG|1|Not all the screws were included, plastic washers weren't strong enough to hold up.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Real nice, plenty big. Downside is that it is heavy! I flipped the center piece over that goes into the receiver hitch to lower enough to open the back door on my JK wrangler.
B001UCBU24|5|Good product
B00353PWAW|5|nice.
B0009IK5TO|4|a
B005CHT4W6|5|Glood oil, Great price, quick shipping
B00DQU9ZYI|5|very good product
B00IJC0GPU|5|Great product.. Free ship... ++++A
B0075CUJWU|5|Wix all the way!!!
B003VBJZP6|2|gauge doesn't work and 1 handle came bent
B009PIKC4C|5|These are great. easy to clean and fit great! better then the leading brands
B00HSTX274|5|Put it on my back bumper as soon as I got it. Nice quality
B013YWVMC0|5|As the saying goes &#34;It is what it is&#34;. The name says it all! SpitnShine..I've used it on my vehicles...no streaks and easy application on and off. Also works great on my glass shower doors...stops the water marks.<br />Check out their youtube video
B005CVXKK4|5|We have an elderly cat who doesn't always get her behind in the litter box.  We were going through miles of paper towels cleaning up and trying to save our floor.  Our auto mechanic suggested the PIG mats and they have been awesome!  When the cat missed the box, we just put down a mat and it absorbs not just the liquid but a good bit of the odor as well.
B00EPA7CZC|1|These are garbage. DO NOT BUY!!!
B000C73IFU|4|Bought these for my GD5 Impreza, A bit shorter that the original but works fine.
B007L6Q1EK|5|Smooth shifting for my subaru! Perfect for cold and hot weather.
B000JZY5ZW|5|The supports installed easily on my '05 liberty.  They are &#34;strong&#34; as the brand indicates. My only mistake was not reading the description carefully...only one in packet instead of one pair...so i had to order twice.
B008QF0BFK|5|Don't be fooled by the picture of a radiator density checker, this IS a Battery Hydrometer!  It works great.  I've tested 2-3 batteries around the house.  It did a great job.  Much cheaper than local.  I highly recommend using this before taking a car in for service.  It will help determine if the auto company is playing games with you.  I had a battery mysteriously &#34;go bad&#34; after 2 years and a service provider wanted to charge me full price when my battery still had a 90$ prorate value on it.
B0001L0DFA|5|This is high quality with a wide range of water disbursement. Do yourself a favor, drop the cheap Walmart nozzle and buy this one!
B00WOY33EA|5|Parts worked perfectly. 10 minutes to install
B00DNISAIK|2|This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. The seat covers are already falling apart. They come in pieces, they are very hard to put on and they do not fit well at all. Do Not waste your money
B002KS5GBS|5|good gauge
B000IYX730|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B0009EUA0M|1|wheel broke first time used
B0085IJVBI|5|I read the one reviewer and saw his dimensions and they matched exactly what mine were, I got it ordered and it came fast, fit perfectly.  His dimensions read 21 3/4&#34; distance between the longest on centers and 4 1/4&#34; distance on centers between the narrowest screw holes.
B000C7Y42Q|5|Work perfectly. Thanks
B00KVLYJ50|5|Works well.  Ten times less expensive than the dealer
B007SKAKPU|5|worked as expected.
B0009OMYDS|5|Great brush for clean the engine bay.
B000CF6RX2|5|Nice look cuts down on the wind noise from driving down the road and side winds.
B000EDQQD8|5|Works as advertised.  It doesn't have psi numbers on the regulator however it is set for 40-50 psi and when installed, the indicator is in the normal zone.  Good construction.
B00VQW8NDW|1|Wasn't even the right product
B00029XH36|5|this thing is so fun easy to install great if you own a ice cream truck or just for fun.I use it for halloween
B003STYXK8|5|Durable, strong...love it
B00VB2OJLW|2|Directions said there would be a double seem to distinguish front from back.there was none,turns out the front and back are identical.I didn't like that very much, maybe the instructions were mixed up. Very inconvenient!
B00IDHJZXU|5|Amazing!!!
B00CO85CXG|4|The right rear trim piece and left front piece I had to cut off about 1/8&#34; so it would fit in between the end caps. Other than that, the other 2 pieces fitted perfectly.
B00BLPPOAO|3|Picture illustrates complete product. You only get the base with speakers and mike, head unit is NOT included.
B000BRQ0TW|5|repaired a small crack in the hull of  fiberglass canoe.  Excellent repair, more cost effective, easier than a fiberglas repair job.
B00A2Y7JNU|5|Item was as described and was received on time
B0027AL3X4|4|Just what I needed to make tight bends close to the fittings. They work like they are intended. Quality seems ok. I am happy.
B005345KYE|5|Good
B00T6JF52Y|4|Lights are great!
B007U9EXVQ|5|Love it. Good quality. Makes my vehicle look very &#34;official&#34; as far as zombie death squads go...
B007AOQU5I|5|Why would anyone spend all that extra money for WeatherTech when you can buy these awesome HuskyLiners for less?
B00KWQTCX8|5|Exactly what I ordered, worked great, no complaints.
B0031XXW4O|4|When I got this out of the package I realized it was to short for my 45&#34; shower stall. But you can make this work. I removed the end pieces from the center tube and by using  white schedule 40 3/4&#34; PVC tube extended by 7&#34;. Luckily I had a 3/4&#34; bit on hand to open up the ends of the tube to except the ends. Lightly tap in, no need for a screw. It works great and the white PVC tube blends right in. It really makes the shower feel bigger with a clear curtain.
B002YKMD3G|4|Fit well and worked good.<br />Is well made and worked for what I needed it to do.
B005OQYCKE|5|Great emergency kit for your car. It has just about everything you need for a quick repair.
B000RFBPQQ|5|For the HD...no complaints here.
B00BCRMAAS|2|Low quality
B00ONDM07G|5|Love it works great for me and install was easy.
B00MJ4JOQG|5|A little cutting on the header and it worked perfect
B001W0F6FG|2|The cutting/ abrasive barely touches the blades and therefore has a minimal effect.
B0007M30BC|5|Exactly what I needed.  Good transaction.
B0008D6NK0|4|Item arrived with a cracked lense due to Amazon unsupervised box packers.  Poorly packed with larger heavy item banging around the box.  I made decision to install.  It worked.  Still working - it's up high in ceiling rafters.  Your welcome Amazon unsupervised box packers!!!
B0031KLPSM|5|Came in early and looks great haven't put it in yet but the quality seems great for the price can't wait to hear it. Planning on putting in 3 sound qubed hds2 10's already ordered hope they fit, if not may order spacers to make it work. Might try flipping the outside 2 first. All in all I am going to get another one for my other car can't wait.
B00QAMKNYK|2|It came days after it was supposed too.  Product works fine, but this was disappointing.
B007ZS9WPY|1|poor material quality and workmanship. The hose leaks at the annealed point where the metal brace covered. Do not buy from this aftermarket part.
B00N25MQQQ|5|attached it (stitched it) to a plain kids baseball hat...my sons favorite birthday gift...wears it everyday
B003FXNCQS|5|Flawless product with features beyond my expectations. I was impressed with the build quality (even the case isn't THAT bad) and ease of use. The unit has a &#34;sliding valve&#34; that allows you to finely control the air exiting the tire. It deflated my 32&#34; Jeep Tire from 38lbs to 12 lbs quickly. You can allow the air to drain while you stand up and stretch or walk away, there is nothing you have to hold onto continuously to operate it. Screw it on, unscrew the valve stem, slide the valve back and let er drain! Slide the valve back periodically to stop the airflow and to show the psi. Its that easy. [[ASIN:B003FXNCQS Currie Enterprises CE-9029E EZ Tire Deflator For Large Offroad Tires]]
B001JT77BG|5|As advertised, after further research, dual antenna is not for a pick up, too short of distance between each antenna in regards to what the spacing requirement is. I chose to do single antenna and working great. If you want to go duel this will work, just make sure you do your research on the distance requirements and why.
B00PXMAF82|4|I bought this for a 2010 CTS Wagon. It fits, and holds my stuff in place.<br /><br />I would like it better if<br />* it were a little smaller, and had to stretch more.<br />* the material of the net felt more durable. (The net material seems less durable than the OEM cargo nets I've had in the past.)<br /><br />For 20 bucks it does what it's supposed to.  It's not perfect, but it's certainly good enough.
B002UC8OT0|4|It totally opens and closes the air vents on the camper.
B00042KG3A|5|Bought this to complete a project. Have not got to use it yet (Thankfully) but seems quite solid. Comes with complete instructions as to the proper use and seems well built.
B0036F593E|2|Very small. They fit my 7 yo son perfect. Except  I didn't buy them for him.
B00ULAIDPI|5|Does exactly what you need it to do, very bright, it's just as bright as the expensive ones! AWESOME!
B0068MO2T4|4|great for dogs in your car
B00L4NHW7Q|1|It keeps moving away!
B000B90MIU|1|This is garbage. Never ever buy this. I tried to return this but told to pay for return ship. I ended up throwing to the garbage instead of driving to the post office to ship this back by paying from my pocket
B00HK58NYS|5|Work great
B00MUEGBTI|4|Works good.
B00XZ9PPCQ|5|This is great. It worked on my 06 Honda Civic EX,and I programmed it by myself it was easy.
B006FL1WWS|5|Perfect fit, why didn't KIA just put one in at the factory? Probably saved about $10.
B004SSAER4|5|fits Acra nicely
B0006JO0XI|5|Works quite well for the price.
B00DOP1CAU|1|Item fit but was either faulty or not designed for this vehicle. 2015 Durango (same suspension as 2014) sagged completely on to the bump stops with these shocks. Sent a return request and was ignored.
B0016IDV9M|5|Perfect swap for my Trailblazer mode actuator
B00JGX2H2Q|5|need it one for water
B00CKIHT1S|5|These lights work great!!
B006ER3B68|5|great lumens, great color, great life.  will buy again. highly recommended
B0002U2V1Y|3|It doesn't work very well on paint without clear coat. It will remove the paint with the decal.
B00GUF74HQ|5|A must for any pickup owner.  Never worry about your tailgate dropping out of your hands again.  Provides a nice slow opening speed.
B000KL2NWC|5|Fit like a glove
B00E1SKAI4|2|Had to replace them in 2 months because the warped
B000KYWMJI|4|Arrived on time, the dealership wants $130.00 to program the chip, so for now I am just using the case with my old chip.
B00XONNQM4|5|The best, I wouldn’t trade it for anything better. Outstanding service and wonderful shipping prices and speed offer 2 to 3 days. Will trade again.
B005FL2T3A|5|These are AWESOME breaks. I am glad I did the research on them and now I can say that all the positive feedback is absolutely the truth.
B000JFHNEC|5|a+
B004J0UKS4|5|Fit perfect on my 2003 Nissan Maxima...very pleased.
B000VL9WT8|4|GOOD TO GO
B000BZLLT8|5|Super.
B00KPVBI14|4|did the job
B000GRT3CI|5|good purchase
B0091FJYES|5|Easy to install
B00CQD4BUE|5|After going through 2 dip sticks (the second lasted 2 weeks before it broke), the CravenSpeed worked well beyond expectations.
B00L2CBNSS|5|2002 lancer oz rally
B000COX0JM|5|Use on my Nissan 2008 350Z -- I change oil every 7-10k miles with this Pure synthetic and have it tested every time and it has another 5-10k left on it from blackstone labs.  This is great synthetic oil, I would say THE BEST aside from the German make (if you don't know about it, don't worry about it) which doesn't justify price imho.  For all practical purposes this is the BEST Synthetic oil you can buy that is safe for all engines.<br /><br />Tip: I wouldn't advise using synthetic in high mileage motors that have NOT used synthetic before.<br /><br />Tip: I would advise using this oil in lower mileage or new cars (sub 40k ish miles) and you can safely go 7-10k miles (or 12 months whichever comes first) between changes -- BUT, use a high quailty oil filter, like K&N.<br /><br />Price is justified, and good.
B00E82UQWI|5|Awesome sticker for a Stan. I would definitely buy from this store again
B000R3WQPM|5|A tad on the expensive size, but it's perfect. It fits my 2015 Unlimited Sport perfectly. It is not hard to put in place as another reviewer noted. It goes in around the rearview mirror. You might need to push it behind the mirror, but it's not difficult at all. It covers the entire windshield nicely and keeps the heat out. I would recommend it.
B0018NL1R4|5|I have a 2002 E46 M3 that I pamper but my old mats were pretty beat up.  These are OEM quality so I'm very pleased that my mats are looking brand new once again!
B001Q7VS0C|5|I use the paste wax on my boat ,my motorcycle and my truck. I love this stuff!  I can't get the paste wax at Walmart any more so I'm searching for a store. The stuff is  amazing and easy to use.
B00D7T4LX8|5|Good piece for self defense. I bought it for my daughter. Sometimes she is as afraid of loose dogs on her way coming home. We live in the country and this is not uncommon. Now she has something that makes her calmer about her safety. Plus, it is CUTE in its appearance to be in her key chain. Nobody likes to feel total defenseless.
B005E39NS8|5|Got it cut, works like a charm !
B001P4HTBI|5|Very nice just what they said it was . No problem and would order again !!
B00OLOBFVO|4|I received this product in return for a review. I put them on my 09 Polaris RZR attached in front of the grill. WAAAY bright and worth the $$$. Don't spend alot of money with top name products, these work just as well. I recommend these to anyone looking to add lights to their SXS or truck! Great product.
B005ESF9W2|5|Good
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great sunshade.  Works like it is supposed to.
B00RC9NH2K|3|Fits the 2002 Bonneville perfectly.  Well made, light material,  good for the occasional outdoor use.
B00L9CQJIK|3|The mirrors look great, but they are extreamly small. If I can find them about 50% bigger from some other seller, I will buy them. If they were larger, I would had given 5 stars
B003U1Q47E|5|Worked perfectly!! AAA+++
B007TG7HV8|5|Great wipers. Good price.
B003RW0P7Q|5|Very fast delivery and worked easily. Instructions were very clear.
B00SCY3HP6|5|Awesome LED!
B004R662GY|5|Just what we wanted and right on time.  Thank you.
B001JT5R5O|1|Major issue with this adapter that you won't find out till after the fact, so I'm going to warn all of you before you buy it. The 2 side metal springs that are supposed to be tight inside the cigarette lighter jack and actually hold the adapter in place (also serve as the minus connection from the battery) are set so far back that it pops out and WILL NOT stay into the cigarette jack. It literally launches itself right back out of the socket. What kind of shoddy design is this and how is it allowed to be sold to the masses on Amazon?  Well perhaps if enough people read this review, this useless item won't be sold any longer. By the way, I tried this adapter in 3 different cars and guess what? It doesn't stay in place in any of them. Complete waste of money.
B000C9MT08|5|The part arrived quickly and as expected.
B000CSD29Q|5|Good filters, it came quick.
B00A9XZ92C|4|One day I looked to the sky and asked, Why?  Why does this Hemi need to be so tamed?  Then as lightning struck the near by tree I realized that the heavens have spoken, and in a roar of thunder I heard the words &#34;Release the Hemi&#34;.  A few days later (much quicker then I had thought) I came to my door step to find the beat up box of wonderful goodness, I screeched like a 5 year old and proceeded to break open the mildly disappointing box to find a simplistic device.  I however know the capability of such a device, so I was not fooled by it's smug demeanor.  I spent an hour or so rolling round, spraying spray of inadequate muffler remover, and used the mallet of smite to remove the inferior device.  Once installed and sealed, I hit the remote start...and then it happened.  A growl unlike any other filled the dirty garage, and once the dust settled, all that was left was a grin ear to ear.  I then took the beast to the streets only to find how monstrous it can be, and with every RPM came delight.  There may be a little drone at a modest speed of 60, but Korn managed to take care of that, as I rock my head back and forth to the beat.  For now the Hemi is alive, for now it gets to scream like a Hemi, and in the words of my 12 year old brother &#34;It was like a beast was going to eat us&#34;.  A wise one he will become.
B005HNZOHE|3|a bit flimsy, tore one handle getting it out of saddlebag
B004QEJ6UQ|5|works well
B000C8ZFF0|5|Nice thanks
B004SO4PHS|5|The price was great, I received it 2 days after I ordered it, and I didn't have to send a core back!  I've been using this starter for  4 weeks now.  Starts my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.0!  I did have one little issue:  The solenoid wire connector doesn't seem to want to slip completely in.  It clips in, the retention lock slides down into place, but the plug seems to slip a bit out of the socket.  I get the impression it might vibrate out a bit, and allow water inside.  To verify I tested the old socket, and it goes right in.  I can't see anything wrong, and I'm not sure I have a problem.  I filled with dielectric grease as a precaution.
B00Q5CT9VI|4|Works as expected, functioned as advertised out of the box with no problems. Unrealistic to give a love it rating to such a ubiquitous object.
B00480BWCI|5|Thanks
B000IETT3C|3|Bought this for my 2004 Toyota 4Runner Limited V8.  It fits nicely, but installation was more of a hassle than I thought it would be.  Had to remove the hood latch assembly and the front grille in order to get it on.  Struggled to get grill back on afterwards.  Looks nice now, except the bow in the center of the bugflector...
B004ZF3TZY|5|I reserve posting product feedback on Amazon for the products and customer service that really &#34;wow&#34; me, or goes above and beyond. Kensun customer service absolutely went above and beyond what they were required to do to ensure i was happy with my order, which I am 500% happy with. These HIDs are unbelievable. I wanted them for a long time because i'm a courier and I do a lot of night driving throughout the Midwest on pitch-black interstates. I hit a deer a couple months ago because I couldn't see it until the last second due to my DIM stock headlights. Now with these HIDs, now I can see the deer's glowing eyes from far away. Not only do these provide unbelievable illumination of the road 75ft in front of my car while also illuminating everything to the sides of the car(without blinding oncoming drivers), but they make the car look and feel more luxurious and high tech. If you're like I was, and thinking that these are more of a &#34;want&#34; item than a &#34;need&#34; item, take my word for it, they are an absolute necessity!!! They are easy as hell to install yourself too, just search YouTube for install videos. This goes down as one of the best purchases on Amazon, ever. Now to get HID Highs and Fogs! Thanks Kensun! And thank you Bradley at Kensun customer service for going way above and beyond!
B00QXAN9OU|5|Hooked up great, works great!  I have a Platinum and this was the only thing that wasn't included.
B00OY3ZHKC|5|The quality of the seat was outstanding loved it 😊
B004HIVFDC|5|Value pack!
B00C80HQCK|5|This light came in fast it does exactly what is in the description it looks great and works perfect I read some people had trouble with sticking it on the window it stuck to my window pretty good it it's hard to take off I also tested how good it holds on by going on really bumpy roads and turning fast the lights I pretty bright expesually at night of and it is also supper easy to put together I would recommend this it's very good for the price better than I thought it would be
B00HEERYQ8|5|Just have them installed and worked perfectly fine.
B001HY15Z2|1|Didn't fit just broke in half.
B00EP0NEEK|5|Great product !!!!!!!<br />More then enough wire!!
B0054YCW62|5|Awesome to hook onto the fence to corral pool toys.
B008YUE9BY|5|It makes your car produce magic bunnies which shoot out the exhaust and attack fellow motorist which has proven rather useful in traffic. However you really need a holy grenade to stop these bunnies once the rampage begins. Just remember the 3 seconds; no more, no less.
B00UZ0OHIQ|3|Great Idea.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Hate how a separate username and password is needed for this. This is no login with Google or Facebook or Twitter. I really hate having separate username/passwords for every insignificant little thing. I'm ~4 months into using this and stopped using it because I really don't want to go through the process of password recovery again.
B000QUXYXE|5|Shipped VERY Fast arrived well before estimated date.. Much more solid construction that stock hinges, should last a long time!![[ASIN:B000QUXYXE Dorman 38642 Tailgate Hinge Kit]]
B000FQ1SWI|1|I ordered this product and put it on less than a week later it broke. Very  unsatisfied
B00HHH15MG|5|THESE WORKED PERFECTLY FOR MY 2003 BMW 325i. THEY ARE VERY BRIGHT AND FIT PERFECT. I HAD TO GET THESE BECAUSE WHITE BULBS ARE NOT LEGAL IN MY STATE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND !
B00E1SKEOE|2|Had to replace them in 2 months because the warped
B002VTIKL4|4|Everyone loved them. They get eveyones attention. Just wish they weren't such a light plastic.
B00YCKHCAU|1|too small, womens helmet?
B006VCUSUI|1|these wipers did not fit my E46 M3.  I ended up buying OEM ones from the dealer, and they look nothing like this.  The clips were completely different and not OEM.  They couldn't clip in at all.  Hopefully I can get my money back for these since they are useless for me.
B001G4Z5J0|3|like many other reviews my bolts started to rust after only a few days.  Also, did not come with all the necessary hardware - had to go to the depot to get additional bolts
B0082FA9II|5|Waiting for this--Super wide rear view mirror, the review was for the 330mms? These are really Great Products,or I wouldn't be ordering the longer version! Great Value! Thank you again! Tess
B002H5PW6S|5|My son loves it!
B000VKTUD2|4|good product, good price, shipping took too long otherwise good
B013KZNR88|4|Easy to install. Good quality material.
B000SZUMQY|5|The cats meow.  Good product.
B001O7PNNM|4|It really helped with my brothers '00 impala that had bad sun damage. The only complaint I have is hours later there is a 'film' like substance where applied.  Update: I had some swirl scratches and also light scratches on a used car I recently purchased. This product did not help with either. Although great for restoring old paint, this will not help with scratches.
B00FW1JRVK|4|All bulbs except for liscence plate fit fine.  Pretty bright!
B00HTP8N0I|5|Good
B001898U22|1|I bought this for my 94 YJ based on the fact that every review said it is not 42&#34; (as advertised) but only 34&#34;. I needed a 34&#34; seat, and that is exactly what I got. The installation went well. The two front mounting holes lined up with the holes in the jeep. My problem with this seat is the latching mechanism (see photo). It is very poorly designed. A small spring is the only thing that holds the level &#34;closed&#34; or latched. Slamming your hand on the rear of the seat will cause the seat to unlatch! Perhaps this is because of the seat frame twisting ever so slightly, or perhaps it's just from the shear force overriding the spring. Either way, it is my belief that a front end collision of more than 10-15 MPH would almost certainly launch anyone sitting in this seat through the front windshield. If they were wearing a seat belt, the seat would crush them into their seat belt. At great enough speeds, the seat belt could do serious harm. Modification of the latching system will be necessary to make the product safe enough for use.
B00NUZ90H6|4|Did not get to use yet they are pretty small.
B00JIHC36K|5|Very bright light.  Huge improvement over my old bulbs.
B007EEVIR4|5|worked perfectly
B00JMAPS1A|5|Bought this for my 2008 Mini Cooper. Works great. This is concentrated, so you need to dilute with distilled water.
B007ICD7GM|5|Works great!
B00W6J1570|3|Did not fit very well and adhesive is not as good. Older style I had fit much nicer. Got what I paid for.
B000C55SMS|3|These made the ride on my 1983 toyota 4wd much softer in the back. I was inspired to research and buy some similar shocks and adapt them to the front,also a leaf spring suspension, to soften the ride  in the front. The system works great. My only complaint is that the rebound is a bit severe but definitely worth it. This is an unhappy update. approx one month ago the left shock blew out. I have never exceeded the manufactures recommended pressure. I'm not sure why it failed but it did. I tried to contact Monroe on one occasion but the hold time became excessive. Not sure just what to do next.
B0065M5GJ2|5|as described
B000CNBD7E|3|Like them, they help block the sun which is what I wanted. they seem to have increased the wind noise while driving.
B00MLKY9AO|4|I really like this helmet. The only complaint I would give is that I measured my head as suggested, across the brow, but apparently I have some big cheeks, which I do. The helmets is a bit too tight around my cheeks. Admittedly, I am a bit portly and have round face. I guess I need to lose a few pounds. I have not attempting to adjust any of the padding yet.
B00061SMS0|5|Best ever worked just like it was designed to would recommend
B008032N2W|1|It was a perfect fit but died after less than 50 miles. My cars runs worse than it did before I replaced the last bad distributor. I could at least drive it before to the shop or home but with this one, it won't drive at all.
B001C6Q7US|5|Worked perfectly on my husband's 2009 Sierra. Air conditioning was only working on passenger side, was blowing hot air on driver side. This solved the problem. Easy repair.
B00BTSHNNO|1|Poor quality. Have never gotten the mic to work. Headphones ok for listening to music and the battery last.
B00WMQPP4G|5|On time and easy to assemble.
B000AMBNPY|5|We looked & looked and finally found this truly perfect screen. We have driven over 1000 miles and I am so<br />Comfortable. The sun does NOT beat down on you at all!!  Plus it fits perfectly on the front passenger window<br />Of our 2014 Toyota Camry.
B0002UHVAA|5|Works good.
B00AWJTY7Y|5|Perfect. Good quality - just what I ordered.
B000IZSB2Q|1|Does not work.
B00ED3YVWS|5|Instantly improves your reverse lighting. This is a no-brainer Jeep mod that won't break the budget and is actually useful for everyday driving. Replacing the low light bulbs with this LED unit makes backing up in the dark much easier. I found the difference in illumination very useful in parking in my dark driveway at night. Easy plug in installation.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and brighten the path behind you!
B000CPCBEQ|5|put in my 2008 Toyota x runner works great
B00514AOCO|5|Great product and suited my needs immediately!
B000HE6ULC|5|Great work and fit perfectly
B000C2WE0K|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00H0QQ1GE|5|Received in perfect condition and my husband was able to install it very easily. Thank you!
B000R4M462|5|I had recently purchased a new van that didn't come with ladder racks. I bought them locally but distributor only had double rack set. My van is Ford E-250 which is long. So I looked online and found a single and it appeared the same as the ones I purchased as if it came wi the set and they look good and work great. Also very easy to install with easy to read instructions. Highly recommended.
B003ZS3290|5|Fix like a charm!
B003XXUWF4|5|so far so good.  We'll see in time what it does.  It is very touchy on back flow and is what I wanted.
B00B0H73S4|5|Good
B000CPAOMC|5|So far so good, but I haven't driven it much since installation. But it seems like good quality.
B00WLUI3ME|5|Fit was excellent, very good product and shipping was fast.
B00T0QFT92|2|Shipping was fast but that's all that is good. After install system charged at 17 volts. Contacted seller for replacement. After install again 17 volts. Purchased regulator from different vendor and now charging at 14 volts. Would not recomend this product.
B00480BWCI|4|I ended up buying a second set just in case I needed a few more than the 10 in one set,  If you use a block(s) to support the hitch without the wheel I found the product succumbed to damage (cut into) from the pipe-wheel receiver.  I suggest you still carry a small 2&#34;x4&#34; to distribute that weight in conjunction with the leveling block(s) or keep the wheel in place.  As many combinations for height solutions are preferable.  I'm using the blocks in combination with a wheel lifter leveling device and placing the blocks below the lifted wheel is perfect and reduce the long-term load on my &#34;light trailer tire leveler&#34; to extend life there.  The second set I purchased I happened to hit a promotion so this whole adventure was worth it.  Where was this stuff when I was younger?  I guess my true rating for this product would be a 4+Stars.
B007TYR0OE|5|Fits perfectly. Cheaper than dealer.
B000E2682S|5|Great Product its just what I ordered and works great. Easy to install . Once I purchased the plug and play wiring harness ( sold separately) . I didn't want to splice my OEM wiring harness. This was installed on my 2007 Gmc 2500 classic.
B00KSSYNIE|5|Great product came fast and was a quick and easy install unlike your mother
B007H2Q6ZC|5|The step is quite sturdy, easy to use, and is a perfect height. I have a cable and lock to secure it so it doesn't walk away during the night.
B00RYGXS1Q|5|Came on time, got 24 little trees. Good buy!
B00EUIDNPW|3|As advertised but was bent on arrival but it does the job it was intended to do
B00D3OBPLI|5|Purchasing from this supplier saved me money rather than going to the dealership. Relatively easy to replace. I was able to do it in under an hour. Product is sturdy and identical to the one that came with my car.
B0054WI7CW|5|I work in a shop and many times I need to drain the oil from a hot engine. This saves your hands from getting burned and works great.
B00JAQ56K4|5|great!
B00I2WV7RI|2|The thought of a helmet with built in bluetooth at the price point was too good to be true, I think.  While I'm able to stream music relatively okay, phone calls are absolutely impossible, even when stopped.  I can hear fine, the person on the other end can't understand a single word I'm saying, get's frustrated and hangs up.  It's never worked clearly, not even on Day One.  I figured, meh... it streams music I'll live with it.  Well, after living with the helmet for over a month,  and switching between this helmet and a 10 year old Shoei,  the old tech Shoei still is so much quieter.  Even with that,  I could still live with it.  That is... until I got caught in a rain storm.  Now, I will admit, this was a HEAVY downpour that I had to drive in, for about 10 solid minutes.  It was an absolute deluge.  And with THAT, ended the life of my Oneal Commander's bluetooth life.  It's completely dead.  Won't power on, won't charge, nada.  When I plug it in,  it flashes red ONCE, then goes dark.  So, about the warranty...  Within 30 days of purchase, you go to O'Neal,  outside of that, you go to BLINC.  I called their number and was told that the department that deals with that, is gone for the day.  Fair enough,  he was kind, took down my info and promises a callback in the morning.  We'll see, I suppose.  Even assuming the helmet gets replaced, which I'm assuming it will, don't get your hopes too high like I did.  I'll still keep it, I suppose.  Hell, I even bought a second one, just so my passenger and I can chat when we ride.  But,  it's a budget helmet, at a budget price, so gauge your optimism accordingly.  I've since purchased another Shoei and Bell RS-1 for days I'd rather ride quiet...  Your mileage may vary.  Will update on the warranty process.
B00G8WLW2Y|5|Great product !!
B00WGT31H2|5|Rugged, little loose in receiver.
B0019O1BS6|1|THIS DOES NOT FIT A 2012 Honda Civic EX-L as stated ! Beware !!
B003CGEUJG|2|Seemed nice at first until driver side wore out and ripped after 2 months.  Should have bought Quadratec like we did in the past.  Quadratec lasted 5 years before wearing out.  Not able to return or replace so far.
B000JFHNQA|5|Best investment I've ever made. Dont drive my car nearly as much as I used to. (retired) Battery would always go dead. My garage does not have any electricity so charger was not an option. I bought the es5000 and its been great. Starts my car up, no problem!!!
B000V55H4I|5|Worked great.
B00B3UWUUY|5|perfect
B001FAK342|2|Solid and clean looking however I found it difficult to put on. I returned and purchased the mopar one and installed through the tail light which I found to be much easier.
B00XOQCM5S|5|Fits perfectly on our new 2015 Veloster. Looks /feels high quality Hyundai.
B0002SR8AK|5|Works great!
B004A42MZI|5|Excellent..
B00494K382|1|I purchased these for my 07 JK rubicon, I installed them per included instructions but even though there was some clearance between the axle and the seal it wasn't enough when turning while driving and both seals were damaged and had to be removed.  This involved a lot of labor to Install and then remove.  Obviously they do not fit my 07 rubicon as advertised.  Waste of a lot of time and money.
B008S9QUGI|4|Easy installation, set to factory key. So far so good, seams to be decent quality. Would love to give an update in 6 months........
B001LA18Y0|5|Nice Item and Service
B00173U7D4|5|GOOD!!!
B0041LIO0M|5|Mounted fine, draws work great ,, priced right .
B004RCOUP8|5|Works great.  LEAD FREE!!
B004BWL9YY|1|This is the worst chain I have ever had. I have had it for a little over 1700 miles and it streched after every ride.  Don't get it.
B00RWN6QCY|5|I installed this on my Jeeps front bumper. Let me tell you it lights up the neighborhood, the woods, you name it I guaranty it. This is an awesome light that is far brighter and cheaper than most other lights its size. Simple to install and the bracket system is great for easy adjustments. This light is like lots of others it doesn't come with a switch just a 18&#34;-24&#34; pig tail. However I purchased a bank of switches and wired it all myself so if it would have had a switch I wouldn't have used it anyway. My next purchase is going to be a 50&#34; same brand and same seller.<br /><br /> Ross D.
B006OEEK98|5|does its Job
B011JBHBOQ|5|Awesome collectors item. I got two already!
B000NZSNU6|2|The lens turns yellow after a while, the red capsule light bulbs turn white-ish and lose their tint. Otherwise products not bad.<br /><br />Make sure you are buying this for the STANDARD CAB models. If you have an extended cab or a crew cab, you will need to purchase a different model.
B000B6JJUK|5|Handy tool.
B00XZ9OGTO|5|Easy to program. It ink took 3-5 mins. Works great.
B0086S057G|5|Luv it....cheapest price around.
B005UUIP3O|5|It was a cute little chain to add to my keys. Perfect buy!
B00NMAH5EO|3|Not OEM but will work for now
B007TY46G4|5|Easy to install, fits perfect
B001T8J4YK|1|GARBAGE - and so is Stealth Offroad. It's all good though. I paid $500 for a tuner that won't even tune my powerstroke. And after 10 hours on the phone with Bullydog tech support, they can't get it to apply either, nor will they give me a refund. Save yourself trouble and don't buy this piece of crap, go with a Livewire TS (I know they're the same company now, but the Livewire is leaps and bounds better than this turd).
B004YD1F0I|4|Tends to slip and needs to be readjusted a couple times a week. Other than that it works well and is comfortable when in use. Strong. Does the job it's intended to do well. I use it, I'd buy it again.
B000F5HU6C|1|Does not work,was bad when recieved.
B0002Z2MZ4|4|Its great product but leaves white residue
B007AOSA06|5|Was really torn between these and similar from Weathertech.  Really happy with these.  They slipped right into the wells on my 2014 F150 and fit perfectly.  Very happy with them so far.
B0013KB1GI|5|fit perfect
B00HRNVSNG|5|It looks so good on my car. 👍🏽
B003UM42RC|4|Cheap and well built.
B00B2PWC7Q|5|cant go wrong with weathertech.<br />Just as described.<br />Fit perfectly on the vehicle.<br />Definitely keeps the carpet clean.<br />i definitely would recommend buying this for your car.
B008KWCMII|5|perfect tint and fits the vega x888 EASILY
B0032H36YU|5|My comment comes after about 5 weeks of use of this cover. I did make a round trip of almost 2,000 miles, drove through torrential rain several times and interstate speeds with no issues. I do drive daily and frequently at highway speeds.  This cover gets the job done with very little movement at 70 -75 MPH. and only trace amount of water from the rain. My only concern is the cam locks are plastic, there's only 4 on the frame and if one of the front ones fails at speed, you will probably lose the cover on the highway. The cover, frame and cross members are well made and look good too. I bought the Bestop Brand because I know  of their success with Jeep. I Recommend it even though the plastic cams are a concern.
B000WJHYPS|4|Product was as expected..
B00MVMRPWG|5|wow  these are a lot brighter than I expected , they work well as a concealed dome light
B006O85P5C|5|Awesome!!!!
B00VLMNY0Y|1|Ball joint does not fit!!!
B000C5FXTG|5|Only wipers I purchase for both cars.  They clear well and I've never had a problem with streaking or squeaking.  I don't buy into the indicators, I know when to replace my wipers.
B000FQ78P4|5|This pump replaced a similar bilge pump on my boat. Easy to install and works great!
B0009V1WS4|4|Works great, but spray spray some lub in the lock for when it rains and make the lock hard to turn.
B00EF1ES6C|5|Great fit, easy install, looks better than factory for lower cost.
B007Q9QNR2|4|Affordable and quality
B000C7OQCE|5|works great
B00IK4HUC4|4|Its OEM.
B00ISA3LZU|4|Great bumper holes line up somewhat
B00C7I4XQ0|2|TINY! Also The holes aren't large enough so nothing shakes out and this size is big enough for seasoning one, maybe two  meals.
B001GRZKJC|5|James is always great
B0067F1128|5|Nice bag plenty of room for that weekend trip.
B00FZQ0HPM|5|Works perfect
B0036WC7CS|5|Put the decal on and 2 years later it still looks brand new.
B002ECKZ7U|5|works well.
B00XO8CKFS|3|I wish it would have specified that it was black in color. I ordered it thinking it was a white decal and not black. Oh well it was only a few bucks!
B000C11JIY|5|This is perfect fit for the 1999 Intrigue's driver side window. After taking out two bolts holding the metal track (regulator) and loosening  two other bolts plus 4 bolts at the motor side, you can take the whole assembly out of the door frame opening. Reverse the sequence to install the assembly. YouTube instruction is useful before trying it yourself. The whole process should not take more than one hour. I decided to buy the whole assembly due to its  low cost and labor saving. This assembly and the switch module (it failed too) costs ~$110. Now my vehicle can have the  driver side window operating again.
B00EKMXIFI|5|Installed these into the flashing Amber Lights on my Kubota BX tractor.  They work perfectly, and are brighter than the incandescent lights they replaced.  The incandescent lights last awhile, but eventually because of the flashing they burn out.  I installed these so I don't have to worry about the amber flashing lights burning out.
B00A757S76|5|Great clock that's just what it seems. Slight sound from the gears and flipping numbers but nothing too crazy...
B00B3WAO8C|5|Just as expected. It works perfectly fine!!!
B00DAI2VBU|5|Good Quality fast shippment
B00L9J99AS|5|Product is exactly as advertised and exceeded my expectations - looks identical to my friends &#34;real&#34; carbon fiber wing he has on his race car. The material is for the most part easy to work with - just read the instructions online and take your time. It's not too tacky and can be re-positioned multiple times to get it just right. I have never worked with vinyl and did not have difficulty apply the product or trimming it to perfection.<br /><br />Shipping was fast and the price was right - I'll definitely order more for the next project.
B000C57XJY|5|Toughest components around.  Priced well.  Perform well, and will last a long time.
B000JK2D06|3|It does the job.
B00LU9ROB8|5|Strong looking bracket can't wait to put it on
B000FCR4V6|5|This is the best product to use to prepare surface for Xymol glaze. HD Cleanse &#34;feeds the paint&#34; and removes oxidized paint.  Works best with microfiber cloth.
B003YNYCJ0|5|perfect fit on 06 Mazda 3 Sport
B00MI3K0OS|1|BEWARE! I purchased the front and rear Torklift Tie Down sets for my 2015 Chevy Silverado 2500HD Double Cab Long Box.  I didn't attempt to install the rear set because I started with the front set and was shocked at the poor engineering and lack of any craftsmanship.  I have no idea how they cut the pieces or put holes in them?  It looked like a drunk with a plasma torch was behind schedule and had Lucile Ball help him out.  Several of the holes were too small or out of round and wouldn't even accept the bolt.  Even if the holes did line up, the parts wouldn't fit against the frame.  I ended staying in a hotel for two back to back trips and fabricated a complete set from scratch after returning home.  The guy at Torklift was very helpful in assisting with my return through Amazon.  I didn't get back from the two trips until after the return policy date closed.  The front set was ordered through Amazon from Camper RV Supply, who also was very good to work with on the return.<br />Unfortunately, I could not find an alternative product on the market and had to fabricate my own.  Hopefully, the folks at Torklift will sort it out.  Just be sure you have a back up plan if you do purchase a set.
B00OGPJ6GO|5|Bought this as a gift - more like a gag gift - but it worked!!!  Car was completely dead and it charged it in just a few minutes.
B005JZSP08|5|I wasn't sure this was going to be long enough, but it is more than adequate.  Helps more than you'd think seven inches would.
B000BN749Q|5|Good product fitted my civic ex well was a little wrinkled up but a few days wrinkle gone now
B00BCVPVGY|5|Been using this reliably with snow performance kit on stage 3 Volvo S60R<br /><br />Super fast shipping, order Monday, at my home Wednesday. Second case and will continue to order in the future.
B00BVL7M26|5|Does it's jobs. I'm not a heavy user, so I cannot tell if it's good for heavy repetitive use.
B00BTSHQIQ|5|Great product
B000C2UKHE|5|Appears to be very high quality. Perfect fit!
B006DD99HS|3|Is a proper wiring harness for the vehicle the actual connection wires are a little short of the nerd desired, have guided in it seems to be functioning good.
B007XUHXRS|5|Installed the new starter and it didn't work  I pulled it out and checked everything, then reinstalled it and then it worked great.  I'm not sure what was wrong on the first installation but I am very happy with it now.
B003UVCY00|4|Not five stars because of battery life.
B00PUYDV98|4|Priced 33% less than at an auto supply
B00CLY23EE|1|Fell off while in car wash
B0087NB088|5|I was looking for a good helmet communicator, primarily for my music needs. I had been looking at the Sena 20s but decided the price difference between that and the SHM-10 was enough to sway me. Lots of features and the battery life is great. I use it mostly to and from work, about 20 minutes each way, on a daily basis charging it about once a week and I have yet to run out of battery during a ride. Sound quality is as good as I was expecting considering how small the speakers are and I am able to hear my music well even at highway speeds. Phone call quality is OK, I can hear others well however, using the smaller wired mic (not the boom) others have reported some wind noise. Being able to utilize Siri while riding has been a big plus.<br />Overall this device meets and in some areas exceeds my expectations, is easy to use once you read the user manual and was very easy to install.
B0041EBSX4|5|These are great gas struts. Used them on a queen bed with memory foam matress and wifes endless bedding and pillows. Still lifts the bed and holds it up.
B001GMFISA|5|Installed in minutes by myself.
