B003G4W49C|5.0|Would have read this book in a day if I had the time. Well done good sir. A ok. Bravo. Righteo
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We all love minions so much I'm ssssooo glad they made an app about the minions:-)  The only complaint I have is it did freeze my kindle fire for a while but then I just turned it off and that did the trick.<br /> I LOVE MINIONS
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This young man survived hell, hate and horrendous torture. He never knew love or trust, yet knew there was something else beyond the wall of wire. A truly amazing story of survival. This should be required reading for all high schools. Our young people, and many middle age ones too, have no idea what exists beyond texting and ipods.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The best game ever!!!!! minions minions minions forever!!this game is very cool and free!!! the best part<br />if you are looking for a good game without having to pay a penny!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is more challenging Temple Run. They added a zip line and a coal mine. The coal mine part is really cool. You can retrieve diamond, which they give you another life if you fall. At one point in the game, parts of the road is missing. That's challenging sometimes. I recommend this app to everyone. Get this app.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Compelling. I couldn't put it down. Def one of the best reads I've had in awhile. Go out and get it!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great movie!!! I would recommend this to everyone. Ben Affleck great job directing as well as starring in this film. I think it is a must see for everyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I say it is beget than Pc beck's it is alot more exiteing for updates and well da its the best android app ever
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|As a Canadian, World War II started much earlier for us, so our perspective is much different.  The American internal debate, the key players and their perspectives, were fascinating.  I found particularly interesting the point of view of Lindbergh's wife.  If you are a history buff at all, this is a great read, well researched and presented.
B000NY12LO|5.0|difficult to read in some parts but these uncomfortable words need to be seen because they are reality in this modern world.
B005F9TQ9C|4.0|So it took me quite awhile to buy this album. It's got such horrible reviews and most people seem to hate it and even Bob himself seems ashamed of it. It was the only album missing from my collection up till the 80s so I finally bought it. And I was pleasantly suprised by what I heard. It's not at all bad in my opinion. It's not the greatest album ever released but it's not at all as bad as everyone says. It's like hearing a bootleg with outtakes and covers. It's not full of #1 hits or anything and it's obviously unpolished but that's not suprising from Bob Dylan. (New Morning didn't sound finished and polished up either.) I enjoyed Self Portrait and if you are a big Dylan fan like I am you'll most likely appreciate this album. If you are a casual listener then go buy the greatest hits or essentials cds. Give this album a listen. You might be suprised by what you hear.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I like the evolution of the show.  The new season continues on and quickly concludes the older story lines and creates new dramas along the way.  The story does follow and pick up where they left off with the addition of extra characters to enhance the story line.  I can not wait until season 4.
6302824613|4.0|Woody Allen said that he could not believe how much money they spent on this movie and how chaotic was the shooting. The late Roger Ebert said that this is what happens when studios run amuck and have lots of cash.  I agree on both counts, but with David Niven, Woody Allen, Peter Sellers (who played this role straight), and Orson Welles, how can you go wrong for a couple of dollars.  This movie has a PG rating but a subliminal rating that would be off the chart if subliminal ratings existed.  Indulgent in terms of simply burning up cash, this movie is likeable because it's truly so bad it becomes a parody of itself.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun, fast paced game where the object is to find a series of objects that progressively help you to solve the problem and open the elevator doors. It's a bit like100 Floors, but more fun.
B00AB7IA1S|5.0|I absolutely love this game. The concept is great. No time limit. Beautiful graphics.<br /><br />I hope more levels are added in the future updates.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I really liked this album. I came across this artist on YouTube and decided to try out the cd. Her voice is very beautiful and the music is hard to describe but very moving. I ask that you give the album a chance and see for yourself.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|Downloaded this app after coming across it by accident. Was searching for new games and this one has everything I like. Had it for around two weeks, level 18 park, had spent a little money (didn't have it long enough to spend to much), had an awesome park &amp; had a lot of dragons. I checked this game almost hourly the whole time I had it, played it before going to bed, got up the next morning &amp; it wouldn't load, I had lost my park &amp; the little bit of $ I had spent. I don't have facebook so my park was lost for good. I downloaded this app again three times and lost each park. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with me not having<br /> facebook, but at the time I had this game I loved it. Hate it only because I can't play it anymore. Please fix the lil problems with this game because it is an awesome game with a few quirks to work out. If it would actually work I would give this app 10 stars if I could. If all the bugs get worked out I would be more than happy to play and spend $ on this game.
0449012751|5.0|We enjoyed listening to this story - had this book for our book club and since we are all retired it was a super read for us!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Androids for me have been difficult to type on versus Apple.  I definitely needed this because of all the mistakes I have had with my phone's typing features.  I don't have sausage fingers either.  I'm hungry now.
0756686970|5.0|...which is good enough for me.  The Lego world has exploded over the past couple of decades, so there can be little wonder that an &#34;encyclopedia&#34; would be inevitable.  My grandson likes this, so I'm happy....
B00B3EVNEE|5.0|since the Jimmy Dewar days of Bridge of Sighs & before. Don't know who's doing the vocals here - might be Trower himself. Best song on the album? Sheltered Moon, imho, but good solid work all the way around. Solid drumming & bass - a worthy addition to your Trower collection.
B0026O475M|5.0|It's hard to go wrong with any Tom Hanks movie, but this one was produced during his &#34;golden era&#34; and is one of those classics you'll just never forget.
B0097JYVAU|5.0|An excellent, easy to read book covering a range of topics such as  climate change, terrorism, the stock market and baseball. Strongly recommend it!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is a brilliant movie-- well-written, well-cast, well-acted, well-directed and, well, great in message.  The language is rough, but at least it's in sync with the milieu and not simply gratuitous.  This one is on my all-time favorite list.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I like the features on this watch but am not in love with the size. It is bulky. The other problem I have with it is that when running it constantly changes to telling me if I am above or below my pace. I don't remember setting the pace so I really don't care. I find myself constantly looking at my watch and having to switch it back to the normal screen. When on the normal screen is showing I really like it. Also, I live in downtown Seattle, and it usually takes a few minutes to find satellites. I never run in long sleeves or pants so there have been times in the winter when I have been frustrated and cold waiting for it the acquire satellites. Next time I buy a watch like this I will consider other brands too.
1433502410|5.0|This Bible won my heart when I read so many great reviews of it, all of which I tend to corroborate to this very day after using this wonderful resource for quite some time now.  This Bible has allowed me to clarify many points in the scriptures I had questions about.  For the ones that are difficult or abstruse, even for proclaimed experts, it will not attempt to deliver to the reader a bogus or ridiculous explanation.  It will simply permit the question to linger, which is, I feel, the proper response.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was probably in the last & smallest group of people to get on the bandwagon regarding this series. When I saw the nominations it received at this years awards shows it definitely caught my interest. So I went on my Amazon Prime account and found all 3 seasons. &#34;Free&#34; is a wonderful word and made me feel pretty darn good that I was smart enough to be a Prime member, as I pat myself on the back...LoL  I didn't want it to end & will be 1st in line(this time) to watch Season 4.
075669812X|5.0|...so I like it, too.  It does seem to be a nice accessory to the many Lego kits we've gotten out grandkids over the years.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I'm one of those people who believe Barbara Streisand has never really gotten her due when it comes to her acting and/or directing skills. I think that is a shame but I love the way she keeps on truckin(old saying!). She never quits & as far as I'm concerned, as well as the friends and family members who love her, she gets better as the yrs go by. This comedy made us laugh out loud because of Ms Streisand & Seth Rogen(omg! He's got the skills).  Loved it!!
B000MR1V22|3.0|If a movie is going to embed a real negative aspect (like bad language), it better have some incredible redeeming factors.  This movie, while interesting, has some redeeming factors, but they are not incredible and are, in fact, formulaic and trite.
0785165975|5.0|Really great pick up from the first Kick Ass comic. I highly recommend reading Kick Ass 2 first and then Hit Girl. It may be a little out of order but it all pieces together. Really love Millar and all his work. I no longer even doubt any disappointment and just check out any comics I buy from him without a second thought.
B000HAB4KS|4.0|...but, despite my liking Keanu Reeves, I'm really not sure that he brought the credibility to this movie that I would have liked.  Still, this is a great movie that allows viewers to suspend critical evaluation long enough to really get into the plot.
B00C81AVNU|2.0|Just wasn;t want I wanted to listen to...maybe after I see it on Broadway I will change my mind...I  will give it a chance
B001FOPODS|5.0|We got this for our grandkids, but when we started playing the DVD, our daughter (mother to the grandkids) got into viewing/listening as well, and we all had a great time.  This is just a classic!
B00AVFO41K|2.0|I have no idea how I'm supposed to play this. Its a pretty game. That's all I can say right now. Maybe if I ever get to learn how to play this, I may raise my review score
B0040X46TE|5.0|The music if IZ is some of the most beautiful ever produced.  This CD has a number of his greatest songs.  The fidelity is good, as is the variety.  Long live IZ!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Ordered this with the Special Ops Knife - to keep it sharp.  However, we had difficulty sharpening the corner of the blade so we had to purchase another sharpener.
0783225857|5.0|This one belongs in the movie library of every proclaimed movie historian or aficionado.  I saw this movie when it first came out and enjoyed it almost as much some five decades later!
B0027MJU00|2.0|I started this book right after Gone Girl hoping it would be just as thrilling. It definitely was not. It was so slow and hard to stay captured.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Not as good as Season 1 or 2 but still can't wait for Season 4.  I think Season 1 was the best.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars if it had more levels. It was fun and slightly addictive. At first I thought it didn't work, then I went back and watched the short video on Google apps. I won't say more about that because I don't want to give anything away.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I read this book in 24 hours. Awesome read!  I hung on every word,anxious to know what would happen next.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great challenge floor to floor with increasing difficulty. Some obscurely hidden objects. As addicting of a game as it is frustrating.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I said it before and I will say it again, this show has a bit of everything.  You never know which way the plot will go.
B005ES5YEU|3.0|I like the color. The size is a little large, but maybe the next size down would be too small...
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Best game ever really fun and I enjoy playing it a lot buy it today you will love it you won't get bored I love it so will you
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am new to the hunger games series and when I read this book I thought it was amazing it it so cool and it has also  a lot of action and I really recommend this book
B000VIK8D0|5.0|Best Wyatt Earp movie i have seen, very well done on depicting the time period. Great choices for acters involved
B006OCM0G0|2.0|Don't get me wrong this game is kinda fun and all but you have to check on it everyday and if you don't you mess up your game and you need gems to do allot of stuff so I don't recommend it
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Most of the people I know like mahjong solitaire.  It's a fun and slightly challenging time waster.  However, due to its popularity, there are good and bad versions out there, especially for mobile devices.  This is definitely one of the good ones.  It comes with everything you need to enjoy this classic game, including many layouts (I counted 42 of them.)  Graphically, it's also very pleasing to the eyes.  You have three good looking tile sets to choose from and several beautiful nature photos to choose from.  You can also set your background on radom, which is what I did.  Play is the same as it is on any mahjong solitaire game, which is good.  One nice thing that this one does that many don't do is it has blocked tiles darkened, so you know which ones can be moved.  It's not necessary for me, but it's a nice touch.  The download size is small, 15.5 MB and it's slightly more than double that at 33.3 MB installed size.  Only one permission, which is \\"open network sockets,\\" which is used for posting scores and Facebook, Twitter and Google+ integration.  My only minor issue is the giant Facebook, Twitter and Google+ buttons, I'd love to have a way to make those go away.  But, that's by no means a deal breaker, as I can ignore them.<br /><br />Bottom line:  if you've only got room for one mahjong app in your heart (or on your device) I'd highly recommend this one.  After playing it for a bit, I removed the other two that I had on my tablet.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great vacation read.  Page turner from the beginning.  Was not expecting it to end so soon.  Can't wait to read the next one.
1476712042|1.0|Just no. Don't even bother buying it, it's not worth it. I can't even write what I didn't like, it's too much! The other reviews are pretty accurate, so read those -.- sorry, this book is just really annoying
B0091REZMW|5.0|Just recently started the game and I'm loving it. There is a steep learning curve, it is not like any hidden object game I've played before. Really glad to have found it.
1452642478|5.0|Book One of the London Steampunk series.<br /><br />This review is for the narration:<br /><br />The narrator made this story a six star rating for me.  She is fantastic and goes above and beyond.  I can't imagine reading the print copy after hearing the audio version.<br /><br />Blade and Honoria both have to overcome numerous complications throughout the story.  They both have pasts that are catching up with them, but together they have a chance to make a future.<br /><br />I highly recommend this audiobook/story to anyone at all.
0345529057|5.0|Only about half way through the 1st book but its amazing so much better than the TV show so far. If you love the TV show you will love these even more (inless you dont like reading) lol
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I play the original samurai vs zombie and so far this one is much more fun!!!! I have only played a few levels so far b u t look forward to more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Unexpectedly and utterly stunning, it is the best read I've had in months. An absolute must for a sci-fi lover.
B008JFUNWS|5.0|I think this movie is going to be better than the last am I right? I hope Iam...... and I can't wait till it comes out
B00466HM28|5.0|My first midi controller .<br />Its very portable and I like the pads , the keys have a little toy feel to them but its fine it gets the job done.
1781162646|3.0|Joyland had me thinking &#34;I've read this (or something very similar) before&#34;, and it wasn't that great.  I'm of the school that expects the answer to the mystery to be somewhere in the story, and it wasn't.  Probably my problem, not the writer's, who is one of the modern best.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|U charge ur box which doesn't take long.  N when u need to charge ur bluetooth within minutes its fully charged.  N u can still use it to charge ur bluetooth more the one time.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Couldn't put this book down!  Sometimes our family members put our love for them to the test and we question our own judgement. Sometimes we are blinded by love.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|As you journey through out ww 2 New weapons will suit  your needs. Money is a little problem but not to much<br /><br />8.5/10<br />Ps running is dumb
B001P3SA94|5.0|My favorite all time movie seeing as I am a blues musician . The folks that portrayed muddy, wolf, little walter,  did an outstanding job
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Just like words and scramble with friends but heart pounding bring back childhood memories of always wanting to be the first on to win
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game was put together very well.  It was intuitive and thought-provoking.  I enjoyed the time I spent on it.  I hope there are more games like it or more levels are available for this one.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is the best game setup I have played with great graphics and tiles in a very long time I really enjoy it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The video cracks me up because all the minions are wohaing then they hug the trophy then Dave goes somewhere else to try to be minion of the year!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its a very very good game. I play to it all day and night. My farther very angry to me for this. Thank you.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|We will definitely be purchasing this movie! Picture perfect quality and don't regret renting first one bit. We try to do that with new movies anyways before we spend a ton of money buying it!
0553386794|5.0|I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN. MUCH BETTER THAN THE HBO SERIES. THE BACKSTORY IS INCREDIBLE. THE WRITING IS INTOXICATING. CAN'T WAIT TO START BOOK II.HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is lots of fun and the horses are so real looking this is fun for all ages. love it
B00COHIFQS|3.0|For most of this show, I was covering my eyes and flinching--- toooo scary it was.... Then the ending suffered with revealing too much. The not knowing and not seeing was scary.
B0047SIXGE|5.0|Thrilling--part reality and part fantasy--I don't know what &#34;REDUX&#34; means!! Not what that war was about for most GI's over there.
0385344333|4.0|Story was a little less involved than the previous Reacher books. All in all a good read and a really good price.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game Is so much fun and its really cute, I love it.Get it for yourself and you'll love it too
B007ZYJT1U|2.0|Sorry, but I tuned out after a few minutes.  This movie just didn't hold my interest like other dinosaur movies I've seen.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Gripping. Be prepared, this movie will move you!, It is based on the horrific tragedy as experienced by an actual family. I just can't say enough to express how well this movie ( I imagine, only the victims can tell you assuredly) captured  the human experience.  Great acting & directing just overall a great movie.
1451668945|1.0|... and based on this one, I won't be reading any more.  Talk about a light read!  Way too contrived and predictable, in my opinion.  Pretty much had it figured out about halfway through.  Characters are very shallow, not interesting, and very stilted in their dialogue.  Not impressed at all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very cool game that challenges your memory and ability to think on multiple levels. Be prepared to focus on the immediate task?
B000N4SHOE|5.0|... but this one is well worth the price.  Truly delightful, if sometimes heart-wrenching, story.  I love the Beatrix Potter books and it was a treat to learn something about Beatrix herself, although it sounds like the movie took some liberties with the facts.  But who cares?? Great movie and Renee' Zelweger's performance is first rate.  Buy this, you won't be disappointed.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I play mahjong I enjoy playing it because  it is challenging game this game here is very good thanks Thomas a.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Original, thought-provoking and development of characters the reader will feel they actually know. Fantasy readers, by their existence, are forced to wallow through mounds of reeking, juvenile writings masquerading as literature.<br />Rothfuss' pieces are rare gems in today's fantasy genre.<br />Well done, bravo, and encore!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A beautifully written, acted, and filmed British series.  If you want to watch a first-class production in which you are immediately sucked into the lives of the characters, this is the show for you.  I'm hooked.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book came highly recommended. It was a book club read--and that's the only reason I bothered to finish it. Predictable and ridiculous.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|I have always  collected movies. This was a great add to my collection. Plays great on all my players price and shipping were great Great Julian Moore movie
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I was skeptical that this thing could do a REAL good job, but took a chance since I had some old dull knives laying around. WOW! I started on an old Gerber and got excellent results... so I kept working my way up in the value of the knives to be sharpened. Just unreal how well this does... rather hard to believe, but I saw it for myself. You don't need ANY experience sharpening knives -the tool does everything for you except moving your hand! There is a video from Smith';s on YouTube if you need a three minute instructional to see exactly what motion/technique to use.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think that at first it is just awesome, then you eventually get bored of it. I think that it is also fun again if you go back to it after a while.
0374203032|5.0|What Money Can't buy is a good follow up read to Professor Sandel's book, Justice, which is based on his Harvard course. I recommend that people watch the lectures which are available on line, then read Justice and then read this book. In this book Professor Sandel notes the increasing use of markets in American society so that virtually everything is for sale. He indicates that the result is increasing inequality and isolation of the rich from the poor. For example when he was younger he used to go to Minnesota Twins baseball games and the tickets were all priced about the same, $2 being the difference between the highest and the lowest. The result was the creation of a greater sense of community among fans of the team. Now most stadiums have \\"skyboxes\\" whereby people can pay a lot of money to sit apart from others in relativel luxury. Also now most stadiums are named after some corporation.<br /><br />Other examples abound in the book, such as the practice of selling blood which tends to lessen the sense of community. Sandel notes two objections to markets:  (1) Fairness--market choices may reflect inequality in the sense that the choices are not always freely made but based on necessity and (2) corruption in the sense that selling things may damage norms and attitudes.<br /><br />He points out that the assumptions of the market are also two:  (1) Commercializing an activity does not change it and (2) ethical behavior is a commodity that needs to be economized--there is only so much patriotism/altruism in people and markets can conserve this factor. But as Professor Sandel points out altrusim is like a muscle--the more you use it the stronger it gets.<br /><br />In sum, Sandel argues that some things cannot or should not be bought.  As America moves more and more toward a market society it is well worth reading this book to ponder the result of this shift.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|THE Entire ALBUM DIDN&#34;T DOWNLOAD.  THIS IS THE SEOND TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME.  IM MISSING 2 SONGS FROM THE ALBUM
0393345408|4.0|Ruchir Sharma is head of the Emerging Markets Equities and Global Macro division at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and as such is responsible for managing around $25 billion USD.  Thus he needs to understand the global economy far more than most of us.  He divides the book in chapters based on various countries--China, India, Brazil, Russia and so forth.  In doing so he makes some assumptions about conditions in these countries that are not as precise and binding as Sharma implies.  It is also a superficial overview rather than an in-depth account of the country.<br /><br />At the same time he does provide some interesting insights that are useful not only for the potential investor but for anyone interested in world affairs.  For example he likes Poland and the Czech Republic in Europe, but not Russia or Hungry.  Brazil gets downgraded, India is seen as problematic but hopeful, China as cooling off but still viable and touts countries you might not think of as promising such as Sri Lanka.  Not every country is covered, but most of the prominent ones are.<br /><br />Sharma does point out that what is decisive in a country's economic development is not the nature of the political system (democracy and free markets v. government controlled economy) but rather the skills and mind set of the leaders.  Thus China has moved ahead because of its leaders while Vietnam with a similar political system has not because its leaders lack the same skills and abilities.<br /><br />I recomment this book for anyone interested in how the world is working.  Sharma provides insights that will impact your thinking on globalization and development in various countries. At the same time it is also important to consider other perspectives.
B00B1CGDTS|5.0|John Wayne at his best.  I just wish that it was a better print of the movie and that the studio had released the DVD rather than a third party.
B008OOYALE|1.0|horrible game. your food gets taken away to easy. cute game but at the market the stuff are to much money.  NEVER GET DRAGON STORY!!!!!!!!!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was a very good read this was a book that was rich in Characters, places and different times in lives. Enjoyed it a lot, I have never read anything by this Author I know now that I will read other books by this Author.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|It's almost impossible to put this or any of the series down once you start. Card makes you not only involved but invested in every character and situation
B00AB55BS0|5.0|This DVD set is awesome!  This wasn't even mentioned on the special features but it includes several animated videos that are narrated by characters from the show and give you a better understanding of the realm.  Included in the bonus material are histories of the families of Westeros and interesting factoids about past wars:<br /><br />History of the Night's Watch<br />Legend of the Children of the Forest<br />Perspecive on Mad King Aerys from Houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon<br />Explanations of the Gods<br />Creation of the Wall<br />The list goes on and on.  For true fans you will not be disappointed.  This purchase was totally worth the money.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Had fun but sped through the levels too quickly. However one level got me stuck for a bit.  It had some creative parts that impressed me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is actually very relaxing. The music is calming. But be sure you have pencil and paper to write down the clues if your memory isn't the greatest.
B005LAII08|4.0|I have a young daughter and I saw alot of my wife and her in Merida and her mother. Great movie for kids and adults.
1452113432|5.0|I like all the recipes and i made some of them successfully. She captures the Paris spirit in the perfect british way of food
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I really love this cd. I listen to it everyday and even got my kids singing! I am very happy!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|So excited to to it on Prime! It is such a great show my nine year old loved the movie.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I am very happy with this cd. I listen to it all the time and even got the kids singing. I love it.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|What keeps this game interesting is the fact that in every room there is a surprise! The moment you think that you've figured out how to play the game, you're wrong. This is a GREAT brain teaser.
0061950726|4.0|What was so good about this book to me, was the back story of Vivien and her experience as a 9 year old sent west on the orphan train.  I didn't know the orphan trains were still running as late as 1929!  The current day story of Molly, a foster child nearing the end of her life in the system, wasn't as good to me but her interaction with Vivien as she serves community service by helping her clean out her attic and finds their stories have similarities, makes Molly's story more interesting. All in all, a very good historical fiction book with current issues addressed also.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|There are all the tools I'd ever want.  Great price for it.  It is very comfortable to hold, unlike other similar products.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I recommend this book, but also want to temper the recommendation.  This book had a lot of hype around it and I think I expected it to really stop and make me think, and even be inspired.  I enjoyed it and found her story to be interesting, but did not finish feeling inspired.  There are a number of societal observations that I think were important to note so that we can continue to discuss equality in the workplace and our society.  However, though the author attempted to address all women, regardless of career aspirations (for those of us who want income and job equality, but aren't looking to be CEO or any other executive), I think the book will likely be most well received by women who are looking to climb the career ladder.<br />Again, I would recommend this book and think there are pearls for men and women alike in it, but would also recommend tempering expectations, especially if you are a woman who enjoys working but does not look to work primarily for your identity or satisfaction.  I read negative reviews after finishing the book about the author being a bad mother and putting her career above all else and I hope that this book and others can begin to change that mentality where we condemn women for being driven and career oriented.  At the same time, we also want to acknowledge that just as all men do not aspire to define success through work, I don't think that equality requires us to expect all women to either.  But we do need to make progress in ensuring equal opportunity and equal pay for those that do and this books simulates an important discussion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so fun and always exciting to get a new level. Love  this this game!! Live in the city right now so yay for horse time!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|ThiS game is so addicting, I was supposed to be in bed an hour ago!!! I just can't put it down!
B004MWI2M0|5.0|Great gift for any lego fan!  This set did not disappoint and is wonderful for any boy!  The whole set is a winner!
B00129H7VS|5.0|This a true to life story. Winters died recently. The story of Easy company was just one of the many that occurred in the battlefields of Europe. This series is a recognition for all of them.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|I previously had Blade Runner on video.  I thought I had a pretty good video copy.  WOW--the Blu-Ray DVD is sensational!  I am more enamored of this movie than ever before!  Great purchase.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is a superior version of Mahjong.  The tiles are distinctive and it's easy to identify matching tiles.  When you begin the game, you can select from 16 beautiful landscape photos for the background.  Surprisingly, even though the background pictures are beautiful and colorful, they do not distract from the player's ability to match tiles.  You choose your style of tile from one of three variations; players can select the set that is easiest for them to see the matches, focusing on colors, symbols or characters.  There is also a lot of variety in the starting tile configuration.  The player selects from over 40 different and imaginative tile configurations.  The \\"classic\\" tile layout is called the \\"Turtle\\" in this game.<br /><br />During the game play, you see the elapsed time and the number of matches available.  You can try to beat your own best time, play against yourself or against others,  You can also skip the (time) record keeping aspect of the game if you want. When you run out of matching tiles, you get to shuffle the tiles and continue clearing the board, which helps to keep the game from getting frustrating.<br /><br />Thanks for the free app of the day! :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is so well done that I can't wait to watch the next episodes... You love and hate the characters, but it's a really interesting perspective always. Great!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very interesting.  Enjoyed this game.  Looking forward to additional floors.  Each floor was different and more challenging than the one before.
0345529057|5.0|I could not put the book down.  Tremendous.  I can't wait to finish the series. I will be ordering the fifth book.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Ms. Goodwin allows the painful swirl of the time to unfold informing Lincoln's decisions and character as well as those of his colleagues that resulted in the preservation of the Union.<br />We read how we Americans killed each other by the tens of thousands - leaving more than half a million of us dead - to preserve each sides differing view of the country left to us by our Founding Fathers.<br /> A thoughtful, easy read.
B00CATSONE|4.0|and this is a good light read of the life of this scientist.  I wish the book was available in print - my daughter won't read online and she wants it.
B008MEM24S|4.0|They were being generous when they decided to offer this game for only a buck. I appreciate generosity. This game is fun, cute, and the graphics, silly sounds and music, and smooth gameplay really make it.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is the best CD yet. Smooth and romantic listening you will not be disappointed.  I will buy this CD for gifts.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So good!!! It has daily challenges and more obstacles than the first Temple Run and that makes it more fun!
B00D37UQ1K|2.0|When I herd they where making a movie of the Host I was so excited. This movie disappointed me ALOT! The whole movie was rushed though (even the ending) The carters where no where near what they where suppose to look like in the book. The acting was ok. I probably wont watch this movie ever agin. Go read the book its so much better.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I love this movie! One of the first I ever watched as a kid and on Blu-ray it is fantastic!!! :D
B007IWG3WC|3.0|I liked it. It was pretty much your classic scare movie. A kinda Jaws meets Jurassic Park... Island, there's a storm, genetically modified animals attack their creators, almost everybody dies. Try guessing who makes it though, I was surprised by the survivors...
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I don't like the recent changes to app. Would like to see previous format return. Will be looking for a new weather app.
B001F8W400|5.0|I loved Speed Racer as a kid and I pretty much loved this movie. I liked the way it was made and the plot.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Full os shocking surprices!  Can't wait for the next season!  My husband and I were angry with what happened at the end of the show but it fouls happen in real life so, the more we are into the show - watch it!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this story. It's so full of ups and downs. I have read it several times and still enjoy it as much as the first time.
1594487154|4.0|I'm learning a great deal about myself and my role in life, not just at work. I think anyone, whether you're in sales or not, should read this book to see where you fit in and how you can improve your role.
0770437400|4.0|fast service and a great book  my son loved it  he thought it was engrossing and interesting and stimulating and is really into the Zombie culture
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This app doesn't work on my childrens' tablets after it is downloaded and installed. I have tried it from two different app stores. I have been able to get other apps  to work very well on their tablets, so I don't think the issue is on my end.  I  have two very disappointed little boys who want to play.
1400049628|5.0|in as good a shape as any &#34;new&#34; book and my son was engrossed it the book within days.........just great
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too challenging, interesting puzzles. I would like it to be a little more complicated or at least longer, but it was certainly entertaining
0345529057|4.0|I just finished the first book while on vacation, and couldn't put it down. I have to admit, I've been following the HBO series pretty closely, but am really excited to fill in all the gaps by reading the books. There are so many plot twists and characters that I have a hard time keeping track of everything just by reading or just by watching. Having both mediums at my disposal makes the story that much richer and enthralling. The boxed set is really nice. Nothing special, but a nice little home for the flimsy paperback books.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|The movie was amazing! My daughters were so excited to have it delivered to our door on the day it was released:). Thank you Amazon!!!!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I like the fact that this game doesn't just end like most Mahjong games. Once you're out of moves or limited shuffles, that's it. Game over. This one let's you play to the end of each puzzle. Only changes I would make, however:<br />1. Hint button should be limited to maybe 5 hints per layout. This will cause people to use hints a little more sparingly.<br />2. I agree that the back button in the menu screens needs to point to the left.<br />3. Leaderboard: How do you finish a layout like Pyramid or Turtle in a minute and a half? Something hinky going on there.<br />4. Where are my scores? Why can't I see them. What's my global rank compared to everyone else?<br />Maybe when I look at the Leaderboard, my stats would scroll along the bottom.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Man of Steel (2013) Review by Kean Hooi Teh<br /><br />Many of you have come to know Superman since you were young and unless you have read its comic or watch its animation before, you will feel that Zack Synder's Man of Steel is a little bit different. It's different in a good way of course. It's not just a reboot or remake of the original Superman but more of an in-depth character study about Clark Kent and his alter ego, our ever helpful Superman.<br /><br />\\"Smallville\\", \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"Daily Planet\\", these are the proper nouns that most of you should be familiar with. Yes, they are the key locations in the comic that's been featured in the film. I have one thing to confess here. After watching the first teaser trailer since last August, I've been in love with this reboot of such a long running series. It has definitely gained my affection. So, I might be quite biased but if it's good, audiences will see that it is.<br />There have been a total of five Hollywood motion picture, from Superman in 1978 to Superman Returns in 2006. Christopher Nolan dared to take up the challenge and started this project to revive Superman to the motion picture and putting Zack Snyder as the director, I have no slight complaint at all.<br /><br />Ever since I've watched the first official trailer this April, I've been wondering how Zack is going to direct this reboot. How is he going to introduce this character? How is he going to tell his story and show us the growth and maturity of Kal-El, who is commonly known as Clark Kent or Superman. Surprisingly, he did it with a familiar technique, called flashback, and it's terrifically done. I'm very happy to see how everything turned out. The plot progresses in a moderate and good pace. There isn't a scene that was felt unnecessary in the film and nothing has been overly illustrated or prolonged. The first one and a half hour is the gem of the entire film in my opinion. Some might feel that it's slow and somehow dull but it's what madea superhero story great, the part where they discover their abilities and growing into a true hero.<br /><br />Let me share with you more elements of the film while keeping spoilers to the minimum. Krypton, as you know is the birth place and planet where Kal is born. It's a dying planet but I'd have to say, it's depicted as being far more technologically advanced than ours and having a civilisation more ancient and established than ours as well. Those scenes at the beginning of the film are quite similar to what we usually see in those sci-fi films like Avatar and Star Wars. During the early age of Kal, his earthly parents taught him to control and master his unusual abilities that made him different from the other kids. For a person with such great power, he has to learn how to control and put them to use for greater good. Is he truly capable of greater good and can he help us achieve wonders? We shall see.<br /><br />No doubt, this is a superhero movie so there's bound to be some or a lot of action sequences. There's a lot of it in the second half of the film and it got a little bit too noisy. Seeing the scale of the destruction across Smallville and Metropolis, I'm amazed, but not impressed. If you are to destroy half of Metropolis in a fight like this, how will it be when he's facing a greater enemy in the Justice League? Will there even be an Earth left to fight on? The battle scenes towards the end were a bit too much, but if you're looking for some great action at the end, it's there and it's epic. Try to think of it as the Transformer, maybe you'll understand what I'm trying to leak to you.<br /><br />Now comes our main character, Henry Cavill is Clark Kent/Kal-El. He has surely trained himself well to don the red cape. With all the well developed muscle on him, this new Superman looks really fit and smart. His character stayed quite true to the Superman from the comic as his superpower came from harnessing the solar energy from our Sun. Our leading actress,Amy Adams plays the ever daring and front line reporting legend, Lois Lane. Her character is well played and compelling. Whenever there is action or mysteries, she will be there. I thought Jimmy would be there to hold the camera but he wasn't and instead, Miss Lane was doing everything by herself. She's a persistent one, isn't she?<br /><br />Russell Crowe played the righteous Jor-El and Kal's father while Ayelet Zurer played as Kal's mum Lara Lor-Van. They showed us that all their hope were placed on their only son, Kal-El and they believed that he has the freedom to choose the path he wants. On Earth, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are Jonathan and Martha Kent respectively. They named Kal Clark and brought him up to become a righteous and well behaved person. Although for most of the time, what his parents said to Clark might sound clichéd, but those words are very reassuring and comfortable to hear as they're meaningful teaching to a young one. Perry White, as played by Laurence Fishburne wasn't playing much of role but he wasn't a coward when it comes to times where people's lives were at stake. Also, he's as eager as Miss Lane when it came to unravelling the truth behind the mystery man as well.<br /><br />What about the villain? General Zod as played by Michael Shannon was a kind of accurate portrayal from the Zod we've seen in the comic. He's born to be a warrior and his sole purpose is to fight. So fight he will to make sure that his people don't perish but prosper till eternity. His motive and purpose drives him towards Earth. His sub-commander, Faora-Ul as played by Antje Traue was quite a fighter too. Her lack of sense of morality made her being relentless in combat.<br /><br />When it comes to the soundtrack in the film, Hans Zimmer brilliant score never disappoints and sets you right in the moment. In my opinion, the greatest part is where the young Clark's story was being told. It's melodiously soothing and most of all, made me feel emotional. The picture is really dazzling and the use of depth of field is wise and nicely implemented. Both the video and audio presentation are awesome so I had a wonderful experience.<br /><br />Honestly, I kind of realised that throughout history, Superman isn't quite an easy story to put to the motion picture. Zack Snyder's adaptation of it isn't perfect and left more to be desired, but it's every spot of what the Man of Steel is and I'm really glad to see everyone has done a marvellous job at it. Kal has finally found himself a place amongst humanity, so will he make a return to face an even greater foe? Nonetheless, let's welcome him to the (Daily) Planet and hope that he has a warm stay.<br /><br />P.S. I'm confident to visit the cinema in my country again thanks to Digital 2D and a Student ticket for only RM8 at GSC isn't too much to ask for.
0525952926|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the story and it is well written --the series is great --each volume stands on its own
B00CLD65X0|5.0|After watching Downton Abbey I&II, I took advantage of Prime and streamed Season 3 on my Kindle Fire HD.  You have to watch these in order to appreciate Season 3's plot lines and tragedies.  It is the most tumultuous season of them all.  Season 4 will be on PBS soon and now I'll catch it live since I've seen the others on DVD and Amazon Prime.
B0000C1733|5.0|Obviously, their greatest hits. A good alternative to buying all of their albums seperately. I'm ballin on a budget so this was the best option for me.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|The zoom for kinect is just like kinect but allows you to play in a smaller room. Many people live in a crowded room. The zoom allows you to have the same regular kinect experience closer to the tv! I highly recommend this product to people playing Xbox in a small room.
B00BY8DIT2|3.0|I was very disappointed in this CD after hearing them on the Beacon Theatre CD where they were fantistic. The music style was a total departure from that live performance.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Read the title.So you can tell I love this game the pc version is better but this one is awesome too. Totally worth 7/8 bucks. And for Mrs styles I already have it but for me it just updated by itself so. Yeah. 5 out of 5 stars by the way I have had this version for a year now.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This novel is brilliant in its simplicity and it's understanding of a language we all know. What if we never stopped following our dreams? What if the fears were just left to die and we followed our hearts to find joy. This book shows how distractions from our true passions can lead to an unfulfilled life and an unfulfilled destiny. If you need confirmation that the sounds coming from your heart are the song of your deepest desires, read The Alchemist.
098555780X|4.0|This book is a really good teacher and helps you do more than just the simple stuff. I would recommend it to anyone.
044024613X|5.0|This is one of the best novels I've read in a long while.  The story is both relevant and compelling.  An excellent beach read, but you will be thinking when you're done.
B00BN3DPQ4|3.0|This movie was not up to my likes of his movies types. I guess that I have to read the info a little closer.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It will keep you entertained for a . Long time hands down. Build entertained up and run them down<br />The game is straightforward
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I think that this should be the last in this series, getting a little old now, would like to see Bruce in some different roles.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|FOR THOSE WHO LOVE SMOOTH JAZZ WITH VOCALS,<br />AN EVENING OF RELAXING TUNES,<br />A QUITE TIME IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE.<br />MAYSA IS FOR YOU.
B00338QENI|5.0|Such an important subject, one that is extremely relevant today. I am so pleased this author was so persistent to get the story of HeLa, and the person and family behind the science. I have participated and know how important it is to give of yourself to scientific research for good of others.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am so excited to finally own the whole collection for myself! The only thing I would say is when I opened the case, one of the tiers was snapped, but that's easy enough for me to fix. I only care about owning the movies and having them work, and now I do! I can't wait to have my Harry Potter marathon!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|We waited for every new Beatles Album to come out day by day like waiting for the first Moon landing.  This was classic Beatles at during their time in history.
B008220BLG|5.0|This movie was exactly what I ordered! It came in perfect condition and I cannot wait to watch it! Thank you!

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and exciting.  Not too hard, but not too easy either.  Cant wait for more episodes. I like adventure puzzles to pass time.
B004ELSDZK|2.0|I got it because of the reviews, but I am not a game lover.  Had to remove it after a couple of plays.
B00006JIA4|4.0|This was all my son asked for this year for his 13th birthday.  He was thrilled to get it and has been playing it constantly.  Luckily, his father and I love Queen too!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Pretty fun game to play If you get bored bored because you get sucked into it really fast, it's hard to put down, and it becomes really intense.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Used this app to plan daily activities while on vacation at various location around the USA.  The hourly listing was very useful .
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book changed me. It makes me think and feel and ache more than I ever have in my whole life. I understand death and life and people better after reading it, and me being the naive 16 year old that I am, that's a big deal. John Green has done it again with this masterpiece. This story is an instant classic wrought with pain and true love.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|Fun and Challenge for all ages. Enjoy playing. Each level gets more difficult. makes you think while having fun! Enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game does make you think a bit. Once you get the hang of it though it is fun. Kind of sad at how few rooms there currently are. I hope they add more very soon.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game is thebest Mahjong game i have... Its beautiful, challenging, anf fun. Majong is one of my favorite games and this one is my favorite.. i use it on my original Kindle Fire and my wife uses it on her KF HD.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Although it's not a fancy program, it works for me! I like that it can be dimmed. I now use it instead of my cellphone when traveling whenever I have to be up early.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Just can't wait until Spiderman gets in to the action.<br />I love seeing my childhood supeheroes morph in to life.

B00C8USQEM|5.0|This show makes me laugh harder than any other show on TV right now.  The writing is impeccable and brilliant.  The cast delivers the material flawlessly and you'd never know they weren't actual scientists.  Definitely a must see show!
B003ZTQN1I|4.0|CD sounds a little tinny.  But I like the soundtrack for this movie and all of the artists who contributed to it.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Great film that does a lot to shed some light on British royalty.  Interesting characters, well acted.  Would recommend this to anyone interested in history, speech impediments, or the British royal family.
B000W8HC8I|1.0|It is a stretch to call this a book, it is the written version of a confession at a 12 step group where the speaker clearly has not yet decided if they want to quit.  Save your time and money, awful, awful book.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a 'hot & bothered' romance novel that leaves little to the imagination--but it's more than just that.  The author does a great job developing the characters, and it was interesting to follow the growth of their relationship from self-serving to a devoted love story.  These books will hold your interest and not let you down.  Language can be very graphic, so not suitable for everyone.
B00B7FXZQS|3.0|Yeah, it had some good scares but there was nothing new.  My least favorite in the series.  Wait for it to hit Prime.
B009FRS9CA|5.0|This is a great action figure of Batman in his suit from the Dark Knight and the Dark Knight Rises. It has great articulation so you can put him in tons of different poses. The shoulder pads and upper torso are made of rubber which doesn't restrict the articulation. Some of the joints tend to pop out easily especially in the shoulder joints, but they just as easily pop right back in.<br /><br />It comes with a pair of fisted hands, open palm hands, and a right hand made for holding the gadgets. He comes with the grapple gun, EMP gun, and a clear stand that allows you to put him in flying, jumping and kicking poses.<br /><br />Overall this is a great action figure, better than the Movie Masters version. And like one review said he can also fit on the Movie Masters Batpod, where you can get some awesome poses with. It would be nice if they would make a Batman Begins version as well. If you're a fan of the Dark Knight Trilogy I would highly recommend this.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|If you are into quality movies with convincing actors and good plot then don't waste your time with this one. On the other hand if you want a cheesy movie about pregnancy and aren't \\"expecting\\" anything other than to kill a couple of hours then this could be the movie for you ! If you like the first half hour then there's a fair chance you may enjoy the rest, but if it feels like watching paint dry (as it did for me) then better to pass on this one.
B00A7MSHHO|5.0|This is a great action figure of Batman in his suit from the Dark Knight and the Dark Knight Rises. It has great articulation so you can put him in tons of different poses.

Its best not to get this for kids who will be rough with it. The Mattel versions, like the Movie Masters might be more suitable.<br /><br />Overall this is a great action figure, better than the Movie Masters version. It's very impressive and realistic looking when you get him in all kinds of poses. He can also fit on the Movie Masters Batpod, which he looks fantastic with. It would be nice if they would make a Batman Begins version as well.  If you're a fan of the Dark Knight Trilogy I highly recommend this.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The Crossfire series is written so well and a much better read than the Fifty Shades books (and I loved them until I read this!) Icannot wait for the next book to come out!
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|Watched this several times with our great grandchildren many years ago.  Now we have great grandkids and want them to be able to enjoy it also.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Every American should view this film, without a doubt.  Lewis was masterful in his portrayal of our beloved President Lincoln.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I won't repeat what has already been written about this documentary. I'm not a fan of F1 at all, but appreciate motorsports, mainly motorbikes.<br />After seeing this documentary on cable TV, I wen't and bought it. It's definately nicely made and covers the unseen aspects of Senna's personal life, thoughts, his philosophy to show his greatness as a person - truly the reason he would be missed. A comment was made later by one of his competitors to say he felt he wasn't portrayed well in the film. But overall, Senna fans and fans of motorsport in general should be aware of this mans life and legacy. Definately worth buying.
B0098460O4|5.0|Inspiring!  Took my breath away... their voices are amazing together... totally uplifting!  I am looking forward to their next CD together!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A true life story told with well researched historical reference of the events in two peoples lives that led up to the incident about which this is written.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|If you like Quentin and in particular Inglorious Bastards - you will like this.  Walz is amazing again, and Jamie Foxx fits perfectly.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|An inside look at plantation life and the cruelties and the coping mechanisms that occurred on an never ending basis.  Story told in character format.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This album captures the essence of Black Sabbath (sadly...minus Bill Ward's drums...but, thankfully, recorded by Rage Against the Machine's Brad Wilk) when they were in their prime years, reminding me of late 1960s & early 1970s Black Sabbath.  Even with rock god Tony Iommi travelling to and fro California for chemo treatments, the magic was captured as if they had never stopped playing in the mid-to-late 70s.  I can say nothing but &#34;thank you&#34; to Black Sabbath, Rick Rubin (the best music producer EVER) and for the fans for keeping the dream of the &#34;real&#34; Sabbath getting back together to record again!  I can rest in peace now that I have heard this album!
145210655X|5.0|This is a well drawn and cleverly written book that will amuse small children and their adults alike. It's a good looking book too, leave it out for people to admire and leaf through. The jokes will have Star Wars know-it-alls chuckling, but even casual appreciators will get it. Our then three year old had the book pretty much memorized within a week and our then 18 month old was so engaged by the pictures that he would hold up his hand every time we turned to the page where Luke gets his &#34;boo boo&#34; bandaged. We've had multiple people comment on what a good book it is and I recently gave it as a gift to the parents of a boy named... Luke, of course.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|A breathtaking read.  I really enjoy Lee Child's novels and look forward to the next one.  He is very creative.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I chose this Blue Ray for my husband for Father's Day because he is a huge James Bond fan and he also likes Blue Ray discs as opposed to DVDs.  We both saw Skyfall in the theater and enjoyed it very much, and I wanted to give it to him for Father's Day.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Not my favorite Stackhouse novel but it was entertaining.  I expected a bigger bang from Charlaine Harris but I didn't mind the ending.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|There is nothing else that can compare to this series. If you have not seen Downton Abbey, try Season 1...you will be hooked. Waiting for January 2014...

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Most British film usually far exceeds any American film. Downton Abbey is nothing short of excellent. Looking forward to January 2014 when Season 4 begins.
B006G35AWS|3.0|Perhaps I am being somewhat unfair about my rating, because there is much that I liked about this film,  After all, this movie came out in  1935, and there have been vast changes in those many  years of our cultural outlook.  For my part, I was bored with most of the scenes of dress models posing for the most affluent people of our society.  Irene Dunne, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers more than made up with their talents and performances.  Miss Dunne was a surprise to the casual theater goer in that she had a wonderful soprano voice.  From my perspective, I thoroughly enjoyed Fred Astaire  and Ginger Rogers.  They were at the top as a team at that time, and it doesn't get any better than that.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|Fun, light hearted, easy watching film - its not complicated, doesnt keep you on the edge of your seat and wouldnt be one to watch again and again - but entertaining nonetheless.

B000SEFCD8|5.0|If you only read one book about dogs, read this one. More common sense and useful info than any other I have read. But don't stop with this one. Read all her books which have proven more helpful to me than any others. I have a happy little pack at my house now and this book for sure along with her others have helped me achieve that.
0877180121|5.0|Hadn't seen this book before but is alot like the Alfred books but also shows what the notes are named, not just what the finger positions are numbered.  A very good beginning book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome but you should have more places to go like the mall or the bad guys house.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I know that most people will know what this book is about. It is well reasoned and readable everything you expect from Dr. Dawkins.
159463176X|1.0|Having loved the author's two previous works, especially The Kite Runner I was so excited for this Mountains book. I was sorely disappointed by it and not quite sure how anyone could give it 5 stars. It started off great and thought held a lot of promise for the rest of the book, the story of love between a brother and sister, trials of poverty, repercussions of sacrifice, etc...it was going to be a great read I thought! NO! the loving kids disappear and a sea of characters rushes in! Characters whom I couldn't really find in me to care about, they were just not compelling despite having all kinds of horrible( gratuitously so) things happen to many of them. They're the ones who dominate the book, not the original little kids whom you want the story to be about. I trudged through to the end, really hoping this book would get better, but it really got only worse with the horribly depressing ending that you're supposed to find some uplifting value in. Why get invested in the story of sweet little kids, fiercely loyal and protective of one another only to forget about them until they are old and decrepit and can't even reconnect after 60 years of being apart? Terrible book! Do NOT waste money or time!

B00CB4ET0K|5.0|One of the best games on kindle it's like console level quality. It's my new gaming addiction give it a shot
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an awesome series for anyone to watch.  Good old fashioned with great characters and love the time it is set in.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I read some of the negative reviews but decided to give the film a try anyway, I'm so glad I did.  This is a tight smoothly structured film, the pacing is perfect for the mood it wants to set up for the viewer, namely the depression seemingly experienced by the main female character. I don't want to give the plot away by giving too much detail so let's just say it was engrossing, intelligent with good performances by everyone involved. The storyline is twisted and no doubt partly derivative of Hitchcock's storytelling style. Obviously there are those who did not like this film but I for one was not bored for one moment.
0553384775|2.0|I found myself very interested in the story itself.  The problem was the authors immature need to brag and play up each and every scene.  The book screamed \\"Look at me\\" \\"Look at how great I was\\" instead of telling the story.  The author couldn't talk about a dinner, it had to be a $10,000 dinner with the finest wine.<br /><br />Unfortunately the book was written in a grandiose manner that really took away from the story.  I can see where it would make a good movie, but as a good read it failed.  I wasn't able to finish the book and disappointed I gave it as much time as I did.
0307476073|4.0|I first heard of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) about four or five years ago. It appealed to me, because I've always had this idea that I'm going to do something big like that someday. Hike the PCT, bike from the east coast to the west, backpack across Europe, etc etc. Something big and exciting, and when I'm done, I'll have this amazing story to tell people because at some point in my life, I took a chance and did something extreme. If that thought resonates with you, I promise you'll love this book.<br /><br />This memoir is equal parts travel narrative and a story of self-discovery. As Cheryl travels the PCT, endures the rough terrain and the pain of being under prepared, the weather, the hunger and the thirst, we also travel through her life and the hardships she's endured there - the pain of losing her mother, the loneliness of no longer having a family to depend on, the alcoholism and abuse of her father when she was very young. It's wonderfully written - the perfect blend of poetic prose and pure snark, and I completely devoured it. At times, it brought me to tears and at times, it made me laugh.<br /><br />Wild isn't perfect. There are parts that drag, and there are parts that are disturbing. Fair warning, there's a bit where she talks about putting her mother's horse down. It's horrible, and I had to leave the book for a full day to recover, but I think there's something to say about a book that can affect you so completely. This book is emotional, and that includes the bad emotions too.<br /><br />This is a book to lose yourself in. It's an brilliant travel experience, and you don't even have to leave your home. It's beautiful and poignant, it's heartbreaking and uplifting, it's realistic and it's fantastical. For a summer read, it's absolutely perfect, and I highly recommend this to anyone with a love for memoirs or travel fiction.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is fun for all ages. My kids and I all had fun playing it. I loved looking for all the clues to solve.

1451673442|5.0|Rhonda Byrne, you are truly one of God's Angels. &#34;The Secret&#34; opened the door. &#34;The Power&#34; provides a succinct vision of the &#34;magic&#34; that opens the world to us, the plan, focus and orientation for a person to change their lot in life (if that person really wants to improve). &#34;The Magic&#34; is the machine to get the job done. This book is a &#34;life changer&#34; for some one that isn't satisfied with their career, health and fitness, money or relationship(s), and is willing to simply work the plan that Rhonda Byrne has built, one chapter at a time. I would love the opportunity to personally thank this lady for how much she continues to change and improve my life. If she was in front of me I'd hug her. Thank you, thank you, thank you Rhonda Byrne.
1612680003|4.0|This book should be a textbook in schools, but that will never happen because the &#34;poor dad&#34;  is a teacher!  It is an easy to grasp book on the economics of life and causes you to double check your own priorities.  I like the book.
158270208X|5.0|I can not say enough good things about Rhonda Byrne. It's one thing to develop a system for a person to evolve and change their life. It's another thing completely to deliver that system in such a way that the results the &#34;end user&#34; experiences change their entire life. This book enables the process to unfold every day. Anybody that desires more health, wealth, career advancement or spiritual awakening can use this book, in conjunction with &#34;The Magic&#34; to get the job done!
159315724X|3.0|The subject was represented but the book did not move ground with me.  It would be a good book for someone who was looking into the subject for the first time but I did not find new information.
B002C39TTG|4.0|The record was wrapped well, but the vinyl itself had a slight skip but that is quite okay with me as it is not completely brand new. I have always wanted this record, I love it - thanks.
1593078684|5.0|I sent this book to my son for his birthday at his request, he absolutely loves it! The artwork is fantastic!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent cast, settings and storyline to create an exquisite period piece of grace and manners. It shows the rigid division of classes, almost anachronistic nowadays. To round up the picture you may want to read Lady Almina, the 5 th Countess of Carnarvon , wife of Lord Carnarvon, who financed the expedition that uncovered Tutanhamun tomb. Great read about the REAL Downton Abbey.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Not a fan of MTV material, but this show has been entertaining. I'm sure we all can relate to this show in one way or another.

B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Lots of good things to say about this game. First of all, it is a very engaging sort of game, even more so than the Sudoku game I have on here. Mahjong requires a great amount of concentration and a good eye, especially if you want to get a good time or a high score. It also has a very good replay value, with lots of puzzles and high score tracking.<br /><br />This app offers two ways of playing:<br /><br />1) Play by Timer: In this mode, you're trying to clear the board in the shortest time possible. The clock counts up, so you're not racing against a timer counting down to zero, but time is still key. For this mode, you can shuffle the board when there are no moves left on the board.<br /><br />2) Play by Score: In this mode, you're not so much trying to clear the board as you are trying to get in as many moves as you possibly can before running out of moves. Each successful move is worth 5 points. Unlike the timer mode, you cannot shuffle the board, and therefore must make the most out of the initial setup. Hints cost you 5 points, giving you a net total of 0 points when you complete the move.<br /><br />The other feature I really like about this game is the customization aspect. Instead of giving you one set of tiles and one background to deal with, you are given 3 types of tiles to choose from and about 15 or so backgrounds, including the option to allow the game to pick one of the backgrounds at random. There is also a simple tutorial that pops up at the beginning of the first puzzle you play, which explains the basics very clearly. You can also come back to the tutorial anytime by clicking the ? button while playing a puzzle.<br /><br />The one thing I have to complain about, though, is the high score system. I really like the concept, but I don't like the fact that it requires an internet connection just to record the high scores. I'm kinda upset about that because I like going back to my high scores and seeing how I compare, but I don't think it's necessaryto require an internet connection. I'm not saying to completely get rid of it, but I think it'd be nice to have the option to record high scores offline and keep the online option for those who want it.<br /><br />So, in total, I give this app 4/5 stars. It's definitely worth getting this app, especially if you like these types of games (you can always record your high scores with a pencil and paper if you want to).<br /><br />- Sam
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I could not put this game down. It is a perfect mix of puzzle and discovery. Not too easy - not too hard.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have to say this is a great game! It's a little hard, but the hints are useful. And I only had to go online twice to figure things out. Some of the other games I had to go a lot more. And it is a lot more in-depth than a lot of the others. Making it a lot more fun. I highly recommended this game for all of you that like these type of games. :)
B003PIUBZS|4.0|Spartacus season 1 is pretty awesome. Its super enteraining. The last 4 episodes are very good. Sparatacus makes the show, however the acting espeaicaly in the beginning is pretty terrible however gets soon over looked with the great fights ands sometime stunning scenes.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out (and I was in high school). At the time, critics and audiences were giving it luke warm reviews. But the dude abides, man. This film only gets better as it and I both age. It's a classic.
B00CDV6WDS|2.0|This is a very well-done tile-matching game, but aside from the tiles themselves, this bears absolutely no resemblance to Mahjong. Traditionally, it is a competitive multiplayer game much like 'hearts' or pinochle.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />The publisher of the game makes the claim, below, that they shortened the name from 'Mahjong Solitaire' to 'Mahjong' to make it easier to read.<br /><br />What hogwash.<br /><br />It's illegal to call Cheeze-Wiz \\"Cheese\\" just because it's shorter and easier to read.  'Woodsy Cabin Maple-flavored corn syrup' can't be called 'Maple syrup' because it's easier to read.<br /><br />The title of this game is mis-identifying their game.  Shame on them.<br /><br />I'm knocking another star off my review for their arrogance, shysterism, and plain out-and-out name-fraud.  They're keeping two stars because it's a fairly decent game, despite the mis-labeling.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Garth,<br />TY, TY, TY! What a Beautiful Story. My 'Love' turned me onto this book as his father used to be a car race driver.

Even now when I think about your story...I appreciate my new knowledge and get tears in my eyes.<br />Thank You Garth for sharing your 'Gift' of writing with us.
1455523550|5.0|As usual, I couldn't put this book down.  Great summer reading.  Nicholas Sparks at his best once again.<br />Just disappointed with the cover.  Much prefer original one.  These people don't portray the characters in the book at all.

B008N1V11U|3.0|The game runs at an unplayable speed, at about 15-10 fps i give it 3 stars becuase when i play it on another tablet it runs fine. Gameloft needs to make sure that the tablet it realeses too should work!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's so cool because has anyone ever wanted to play a game when your in the middle of another game well now you can switch back and forth between two games at once and its sales your game time
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|If you're a gangster lover like I am this is a movie to see. Great actors. All looking pretty young back then. Great story line as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great. I saw my friend playing it on his phone the other day, and so I had to get this game for myself. It reminds me alot of Sonic The Hedgehog games with how fast the minion can run and his dodging techniques, and the fact you gotta collect bananas for currency like you gotta collect Rings in Sonic.<br />As a huge Sonic fan, I can say that's a good thing.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|I thought it was excellently done in terms of direction, cinematography, storyline, script, acting, and production.  But this is a hard film to get through - both for the violence in the first half, and the truly uncomfortable torture sequences in the second half.  I thought it was an extremely well-done and original film, but it's definitely not for everyone.  Both of the lead actresses ( Morjana Alaoui, Myl&egrave;ne Jampanoï) were fantastic, as were the supporting cast.  But I would not recommend this for anyone who doesn't have an extremely strong moral constitution - it stays with you for a long time (think of Videodrome X 10).  Very bleak, and very gut-wrenching, but outstanding film if you can tolerate this kind of thing.  Think long and hard before you order this one - but if you do decide to order it, you won't be disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a fun game to do when it is raining out....I think all horse overvalued have this app....it. also can show you what you need to do if you want to get a real horse

If you don't own a cat, but know someone who does, buy this book for them.  The Oatmeal is bananas, visit the website for bunches of laughs.  My favorite characters in the book are the Bob Cats, they remind me of The Office.

B008CJ0KBU|1.0|let's this series down. I had high hopes of it at first, as something a little more adult than the slew of sheroes from the Buffy/Xena/charmed era. This though is a massive let down. Bo is a succubus, but she may as well have been written as a vampire - there's nothing new here. Anna Silk does a pouty Angelina Jolie impression in the lead role, she wafts through all her sexual encounters looking bored and wooden. The rest of the cast are no better. The characters don't mesh, and nothing can persuade me to care about them. You can't blame the actors though, the whole production looks rushed and a script is more than a few supposedly witty one liners. The truth is, psychos have been so overdone, even when they are sexy half 'Fae' ones. Been there, done that.

0812984412|5.0|After seeing the movie recently, I ordered the book - it is stunning!!!  The writer has crafted a novel about love, hate, relationships, slavery (in various forms physical/mental), reincarnation, past, present and future!!!  David Mitchell has a way with words - literally! I would like so much if he would write a lexicon or dictionary of the words he crafted.  Imagine my surprise when I looked up &#34;orison&#34; to find it meant &#34;prayer.&#34;  I am 3/4 through the book and find I am enchanted by this writer's awesome writing.....  as a result, I have ordered his 1st book &#34;Ghostwritten&#34; to read as soon as I'm done with Cloud Atlas.  I highly recommend this book.  It makes you think... about life, about the choices we make, about our humanity......
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Anyone into BDSM can see that this was written by someone who didn't do much research into the lifestyle, but I won't get into that much. (Ok, Master would not give his sub oral pleasure without her first earning it,  a sub asks permission to cum, and so on...) Regardless... the eye rolling and lip biting, her frequent reference to her vagina as &#34;  my sex...&#34; (lame! who SAYS that??!), the notion that a somewhat normal woman in her 20's has never pleasured herself EVER... all of this is so distracting and so awful that I wanted to get a red pen and mark it all up. However, if you can get past that, it can kill a few hours with some fun sex ideas. I guess.
0425263924|3.0|no major changes from the second book.....<br />i was anxious for this book to come out, but then it seemed to be somewhat the same 'limbo' status for the characters....
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|This is a pretty cool little shooter for the Kindle Fire. While it is a free game, you still need to purchase coin to upgrade or use better weaponry and there are no pick ups.  Sessions of gaming do use up your battery more quickly than doing other apps.  Not bad if you have some time to, excuse the pun, kill.  Graphics are decent and gameplay - well, let's just say there's a bit of a learning curve.  Still, overall likeable for me.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have been using this app for over a year and they've recently changed the usage features.  The new features do not allow easy navigation between panes... going from hourly weather to 3-day forecast to maps is nearly impossible.  I don't care for the new Weather Channel For Android app.  The old app was much more user friendly.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|My daughter told me about this book a while back, but I was apprehensive about reading it, because I really didn't think I would like reading about zombies. I'm glad I finally decided to read this one. Not only is it well written, but it also makes the unbelievable seem believable. This book is not just a story about zombies. Its story contains multiple levels of meaning concerning human societies and politics.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|This is a great movie. Once again, in \\"Flight\\", Denzel Washington proves his ability to carry an entire movie by himself. For whatever reason, the director and producer felt the need to introduce a \\"complication\\" to the plot and in the process add the extra minutes that make this legitimate 2-hour movie into a 2.5+ hour movie. I really don't see what purpose whats her name (that's how memorable she is in this movie) serves in this movie other than to add time and make the movie longer than it needs to be. She gets clean, he doesn't. Big deal. The tie-ins and coincidences (his plane flies over her apartment building upside down while they're hauling her out after she ODs and they end up in the hospital stairwell smoking together and fall in love - yeah right) that bring the two of them together are laughable and there's just no need for a female main character in the movie. Especially as she actually plays such a small part in it. This is a story about one man and his demons and his strengths and his weaknesses and she doesn't fit into the story. Otherwise, this movie is great. Once again, Denzel Washington excels at playing a mix of good guy/bad guy and as he ages he's not afraid to show that he's aging. Which could be the biggest difference between male actors and female actors and why male actors continue to get good parts as they age. They ACCEPT THAT THEY'RE AGING AND USE IT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. Female actors try to stay young. Men embrace their age.

B000IKQK7E|5.0|Had to get this one to beef up the comedy section of my personal video library.  This is one of those films I watch about once a year and I laugh every time....
B005LAIH2M|4.0|I gave this four stars as I like Sci-Fi not horror and I thought the story was done well considering the original story which they had to start with. They added quite a bit and really changed the story which benefits the story done in a movie format. If they had stayed with the original story it would have been boring. But they added a lot of action and so many twists that you can barely sense the original story of Hansel and Gretel. But as I said, it benefits this movie format. Buy it or rent it, it is worth the time. I buy a lot of movies as I am terrible returning movies. As I type this I have 2 movies on the end table that are now 3 days overdue and due to the fact that they are Blu-Ray and who knows if they will make it back tomorrow I know I have already wasted at least $10 and that doesn't include the original rental price from Redbox. To top it of, if I want to watch the movie again I will have to pay all over again to see it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game for passing a few minutes at a time.  The first couple of levels are pretty easy.  They do get harder!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I grew up watching the original Star Trek movies, and the series reruns.  I never hesitated to watch them if they happen to pop up on HBO, or Sci Fi.<br />So when Star Trek 2009 came out, I was skeptical.  Because while I like Picard, I just never had much enthuisiam for the subsequent Star Trek Series (voyager, Next Generation, etc).<br />So I happen to catch on HBO once it came out on regular TV . . . and loved it.  The casting was perfect, easily being able to pick out who was who before their names were ever giving.  Each actor brought many of the same quirks, facial expressions, etc of the original caste.<br />Definitely worth the watch!
B00AMYX60U|5.0|This is a perfect production top notch recording and mixing. Gabrielle is an earth born angel (i suspect). The songs are inspiring and astoundingly beautiful, & well composed. BUY THIS DISK.

1623420148|5.0|Hats OFF, to Emma Chase!!! This is by far the most brilliantly written, & heartfelt story I've ever read. I wish I could give you 6 to 7 stars. I laughed throughout the whole book.Drew and Kate's story reminds me of one of my favorite movies. Drew was totally hilarious. I highly recommend this book on so many levels.  If anyone is lonely, bored or just down & out, and need a spark of life, you MUST read this book.  It will have you screaming with laughter, I Promise!!! I can't wait to see more from this fabulous author. I read the whole book in one setting.  Totally Loved IT!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I'm addicted to this game! ( in a good way, of course ) my brother and I each have this app, and we try to beat each other's scores! I haven't beaten him yet, but that doesn't matter!  All that really matters is that I'm having fun! Isn't that really what what matters in life?!? :/
B00C81AVNU|5.0|i was a big fan of the movie and a huge fan of the soundtrack, so although i wanted to love this completely, it had big shoes to fill.  i can happily say, filled they did.  if you are hoping for another version of the movie soundtrack, this isn't it.  if you are looking to enjoy a new incarnation of a great movie, give it a listen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I too had downloading issues and was about to agree with the one star ratings. Then, I moved to an area with a stronger WiFi signal. The game downloaded just fine after that. It's very cute and fun.

0989254607|5.0|Tegen Cave by Inge-Lise Goss is an engaging read that had me, at times, crawling out of my skin, and jumping out of my chair.<br /><br />It's an extremely clever premise and it includes elements of romance, murder mystery, human sacrifice, the mafia, spiders and an asundry selection of plausible characters --none of whom I'd want to meet in real life.<br /><br />Inge-Lise's writing flows and doesn't let go until the novel is concluded.<br /><br />Tegen Cave is an excellent book and I recommend it if you like (plausible) fantasy, murder mysteries, and whacked out romances -- even if you don't like spiders.<br /><br />Judy Logan<br />Author<br />Las Vegas, NV

B0070066DI|3.0|Put an i5 under it.<br /><br />I'm working in a tight ITX case and this heatsink happens to be the best one that meets my height limitation.  If you've installed a heatsink on a motherboard before, this is no more complicated.  I don't understand other reviewers complaints, it's rather simple actually.<br /><br />The cooling performance is moderate to good.  It's rated significantly better than COOLER MASTER GeminII M4 and the Shuriken 1.  It's on par with the Noctua NH-L12 except that the Noctua is taller and won't fit in my case.  It's also less than half the price of the Noctua (at least it was when I bought it)  Even though it's old, it's tried and true and works well.<br /><br />I swapped the worthless extra low profile fan for a standard 120mm Cooler Master Blade Master PWM fan and it instantly dropped my temps 12-16deg C across the board (yes even 10+deg at idle).  WIth the stock fan, you get maybe 15% better than standard intel cooler performance (albeit pretty much silent unless the fan breaks 1200RPM).  With the Blade Master fan, you can push about 1.35vCore through an IB i5 with no cooling issues and temps around 80 on synthetic tests.<br /><br />I give it three stars because in retrospect, I wish I had gone with a closed loop liquid cooler.  I picked up a decent one for the same price then returned it because I didn't want to mess with potential leaks.  After a ton more research, there is really no danger of such a problem and would have fit my case much better.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|This movie had a lot of action and blood. Do I need to say more? I guess for those people looking for a little more substance, this movie will satisfy that for you. The back-story as well as the continuation and development of that back-story into current events withing the film really do make for a great movie. The director does a good job in character development and in making you sympathize with the characters, who happen to be killers of witches. But I am sure everyone should be able to figure that out. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I personally think I got a refurbished product. I have to keep it wired to the PS3 to work right. When using it wireless, it's like one of the buttons is being continuously pressed down and it makes it unusable. I can't believe I paid $40+ for this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|good luck EVERYBODY ELSE  you should buy this I gave this five stars I am glad that they made this game
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|To be honest, I didn't know what to expect.  However 13 is a Great Sabbath Album.  The songs have the same recklessness of their first albums.  It is unformulatic.  Lots of cool parts and interludes.  The band sounds hungry and real.  Not like a forced &#34;reunion&#34; album.  Thanks Tony!  Brad Wilk was the perfect choice to replace Bill Ward.  He maintains a great feel reminiscent of Bill.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I downlpaded this game yesterday and i still have to delete apps to get more space to download this game aand i have nothing else on my kindle left
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Very nice beat, easy on the ears, fun music.  Love it.  Mark Knopfler never seems to disappoint!  Three more words.
B0098VYE4U|4.0|Even though I am not Catholic, seeing all the Cardinals as they would have gathered to elect a Pope is awe-inspiring. The actors who play the Cardinals are great character actors that demonstrate the different nationalities and personalities of these august figures. Imagining what they might actually be thinking about taking on such a monumental role is hysterical. The gentleness and spiritual maturity of the one who gets the short straw, contrasting his complete terror is poignant. The Italian with subtitles makes this a little slower for an English speaking audience but more realistic also. I enjoyed it!
1400082773|4.0|I liked this book and thought it was pretty candid. I don't think it repreents the man who is president today however.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I love everyone of the Kendrick movies because even though the earlier movies were produced with a limited budget, the storylines and the truth in their response to God is powerful and spot on. More cynical types have made fun of their honest dialogue, and that is very unfortunate because these movies should be seen so people can wrestle with the spiritual issues they address. These are for people who want a big faith and whole-hearted commitment to the God of the universe. If you want to shake off a quasi-Christian faith and be challenged to see what real reliance on God would look like, check these out.<br /><br />Courageous addresses the issues of fatherhood, challenging fathers to be the man that a family needs - a spirutal leader, engaged with their children, actively shaping their character by role modeling and parenting. Some will succeed and some will fail because of their own character flaws, but all can at least try and show up. This movie will make you cry in the way it illustrates how short our time with our children really is. But these are issues that need to be faced head on. Even though it is for fathers, mothers too can glean the same important principles on the critical need for godly parenting.<br /><br />God has entrusted your children to you for a time. Have you really considered what this means in your interactions with your children and the influences you are bringing in their lives?
0062255657|5.0|This book is not quite fairy tale and not quite memoir. Perhaps Gaiman's most accessible novel. Enchanting.<br /><br />Fans will find the horror, exquisite pacing, and wonder they have become accustomed to. In addition, Gaiman has captured perfectly the feeling of being a child: knowing a great deal, not understanding or misunderstanding much of it, noticing things adults don't,etc. But especially the impotence of childhood, feeling, perhaps accurately, that one has absolutely no control over one's own life.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Sophie Kinsella is one of my favorites and this book didn't disappoint.  This book was such fun!  An easy breezy, perfect beach read!

B006LRUVUA|5.0|It does what it does on you computers only this lets you use your kindle fire to control other comps.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A riveting story of what life is like in North Korea's equivalent of the Gulag camps.<br />Could hardly believe the disregard for human life by the North Korean Government.<br />I could not put the book down.<br />More people throughout the World and the USA should be aware of how the regime treats<br />their own.<br />Highly recommended.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After reading reviews....I wasn't going to get this book..<br />But I am glad I did.  So what if she continues the story to make more money?  I'm looking forward to more books to read about this hot sizzling couple!!
0375842209|5.0|\\"The Book Thief,\\" by Markus Zusak, is a must read for all people. The story, narrated by Death, is about a young German girl coming of age during the Holocaust, one of the world's most tragic historical events. She stumbles upon a book she finds near her brother's grave and thus begins her flirtation with literature. She is insatiable and does all she can to read and further her love for books, stealing them from wherever she can. Her foster family allows a Jewish man to live in their basement, taking on a huge risk. However, at the same time Death is attempting to untangle the mystery that is the human race.<br /><br />The story is complex, well-written, and humorous. Despite its setting and some of the topics it covers, the book is anything but morbid.<br /><br />It's a tale for someone who loves reading and wants to be involved with the story. It's a novel for anyone who can read! Some of the most beautiful parts of the book are when Death sits and watches the sky, as well as when he lets you know what is coming in the future. I think people 13 and up should read the book. It's one of the more pleasurable reads out there.<br /><br />Review by Anika T., age 17, Northern New Jersey Mensa
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is awesome and my kids absolutely love it! So glad I purchased it! Cannot wait to buy the 2nd one when it come out.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The post-apocalyptic storyline is great, but the juxtaposition of the natural environment with the high-tech digital reality of the games was just too jarring. The scenes with the dog-like creatures in the end just made you think that the controllers of the games could have made any outcome work, so it took away from the cunning and resiliency of the contestants. Not sure how this was handled in the book, but it just didn't translate that well to the screen.  The movie was a great tale of resistance against powerful and completely degenerate leadership, so it was worth it, and the natural setting in the western North Carolina mountains was beautifully filmed.  I just found the Sci-Fi elements distracting from the movie's message. Jennifer Lawrence is very impressive here, but she plays pretty much the same character to better effect in &#34;Winter's Bone.&#34;
B0014J8D9Q|4.0|ONE ON MY FAVORITE WESTERN. NOW I WILL BE ABLE TO WATCH ANYTIME WELL WORTH BURYING CD<br />WOULD RECOMMED TO ANY WESTERNS LOVERS.

B003PR77II|5.0|He loves the band, loves the music, and shares it with his family.  Avenged Sevenfold makes good music, and it's something the whole family can listen to.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|It is an awesome prequel to the Alien series, the technology in the movie is a good precursor such as the cryo-tubes as the side-effects of cryo-sleep, and the vehicles, the first generation of the Xenomorphs was interesting to say the least, but my only qualm is that other technologies such as the holograms are superior to what they had in the Alien series.
B000P0J06K|5.0|it can be summed up with this: he doesn't quit being Batman after a year and a half because his not-girlfriend-girlfriend was killed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|challenging.addictive.and fun!!! color. codes. and numbers. does it get any better than that?!? I like how it trains and exercises my memory.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great read. Pulled me in and didn't let me go for the entire book. I have never read a book by this author before but if his other works are as we'll written as this on, he has a new fan! Only hope the sequel comes out soon!

B000VE439Y|5.0|Have to be of special mindset to understand this stuff, and I love it! A little dry if you're not use to it, but worth it.  DVD was in a great shape, new.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|There are so many different challenges that make this game hard but fun too. People stare at me when I play because I yell at the sleepwalker. Yet, I don't care because I'm having fun.
0761169253|2.0|Maybe I'm thirty years too old--hope springs eternal in the larcenous heart--but I feel Mr. Kleon has stolen my money.  Well played, sir.
B001RUXW48|3.0|If you like intrigue and conspiracy and action movies, you will probably enjoy this.  It has a strong cast and some great moments, but somehow it misses the mark.  So, it is a good movie if you have nothing better to watch, but don't go into it with too high of expectations.  Be warned, there are a couple of pretty gruesome scenes, so think twice about it if you or someone else in your family might be disturbed by them.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I've never been a HUGE fan of Black Sabbath, but have always enjoyed what I heard on the radio.  Listened to several samples on Amazon and enjoyed it.  Bought the CD from my local record store and I gotta say it's really great.  Sounds like the traditional Black Sabbath hits I know, but with a great modern edge to it.  Incredible bass guitar combined with awesome guitar rifs, great drumming and intelligently written lyrics combine with Ozzy's great vocals make for a great album!
B00846TRHY|4.0|I really enjoyed this much to my surprise.  The goofy title almost kept me from watching it and then the incredibly rough beginning also nearly caused me to turn it off, but I had a few friends tell me it was a good movie that was inspirational and so I made it through that and sure enough, I wound up really liking this movie.  It made me want to make more of a difference with my own boots on the ground (i.e., heading to Oklahoma to help the Tornado victims and such).  Any movie that stirs me to action is a very good movie.  I would've given it 5 stars, but it is obvious that they were working with a fairly restricted budget - but still a very good movie).  Warning, some of the beginning scenes are very rough, and so is some of the language.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I love the display and functionality of the app, but within the last month, it's started having issues with crashing upon opening and won't be fixed until I delete it and reinstall. I do it because I enjoy the app, but it's a major annoyance.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. I love the effects &amp; when you think you,know every cpurse it changes. Very addictive &amp; cute.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is my fifth or sixth reading and I love it as much as the first.  Great series of books!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This was the kind of book that is hard to put down once you begin.  The characters are endearing...wish there really was a place I could visit.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|It is nice, well made solid case for a kindle. I wish it had a holder for the stylus I bought to use with it.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I needed to see the cliff hanger of the last show, missed it but was happy to find it on amazon.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I'd recommend this game to any one who wants some thing a little diferent than regular solitare.<br />My wife like regular solitare best.
B00A8FXT8M|5.0|Very interesting story with deep insight into human psychology. The writing is exquisite. I could not stop reading the book.
0440245206|5.0|It is a nice simple book. Nothing wow, but an easy read. I have nothing else to say but this forces me to write too many words every time
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved, loved the book.  Can't hardly wait to read the next book in the series.  All the characters in the book are interesting, and will have you cheering them on.
1594481717|4.0|I work in the games industry and I can definitely see how all of the core ideas in A Whole New Mind are helping the best people and companies move forward. Was a very insightful read that applied to my daily activities much more than I would of imagined.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the challenges of this game and look forward to new levels.  This game challenges you ability to think out of the box.
0439023513|2.0|This book did not hold up to books 1 and 2 which is unfortunate. Collins was great in describing the actual games, but she seems to of lost her way in large scale war and rebellions. All in all it did wrap up the story well, but it just didn't have the excitement or depth that the first two did.<br /><br />Fortunately, I think the movie will be infinitely better as they should be able to show the battles and intensity much better than Collins could write them.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|If you like Khaled Hosseini's writing style (as I do) you will enjoy this book.  It can get a bit<br />confusing keeping all the characters in order with the constant changes in the story line,<br />but it is very interesting and enjoyable.
1478343516|2.0|I picked this book after &#34;looking inside&#34; all available Complete Sherlock Holmes editions on Amazon. The print is by far smaller than what I expected after comparing it to the other editions. This won't be fun to read, I am disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game, even though it became bothersome clicking the wrong thing. I just wish it was longer. Would reccomend to anyone who likes a good puzzle.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Great. graphics and sounds just all around awesome! Did end up spending some money to upgrade some weapons. Couldn't put it down first several days.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love the movies and now love the game it's awesome the graphics look great and the battle with vector was hard but not too easy were anyone could beet it. love it !!!!!  :D
B003H6KRIE|5.0|My entire family loves these movies.  I was excited when the trilogy went on sale on bluray as I had not bought them yet.<br /><br />The picture and audio quality is excellent, and the movies speak for themselves.<br /><br />A must buy for any action adventure spy movie fan.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A friend got me hooked on the Kingkiller chronicles without telling me that the third book isn't out yet.  I may need to go to wisconsin and do terrible things to him because this series is most excellent.  Not knowing how the story will progress is driving me crazy!<br /><br />Real review: excellent book.  Great characters, great story, excellent setting/environment, and some really fascinating architecture.  Love it :D
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is unexplainably<br />great. It's really interesting to see in the eyes of someone else with different struggles. This book made me cry, laugh, and always kept me entertained. Get it I know a teacher in my grade read it to her whole class and another teacher that just read it to himself and so many others who loved the book. Definitely get it but it will make you very emotional. I wouldn't recommend it to a.\\"younger crowd\\". I'd say about 4th grade earliest through about 6 or 7th grade.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun game. A little challenging but not to difficult. Need more floors though. Also a few hints would be helpful.
1781162646|5.0|I am an avid Stephen King reader.  I just love how he brings you right into the scene with his writing.  \\"Joyland\\" was more of a short story for him but was not short on content.  I hope he does more of these \\"mystery stories\\".  Read this book, you will not be disappointed.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Well written, courageous story of persistence and determination - I think she learned a lot about herself and was able to have a better life because of the trial that she went through
B006LSZECO|3.0|this is definitely a summer reading book as it only keeps you going through all the good drama and dialogue
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Long movie, but kept our interest the whole time.  Good story line mixed with strong content and comedy. Great cast.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations 100 fold!! It is a hard one to define...part spy story , part love story...all bundled up with a historical twist. enjoyed every last word!!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander writes a fascinating account of the spiritual reality that many struggle to accept in the modern world. His education and scientific credentials lend credibility to his affirming experience of God and the after life. It should give pause to skeptics and fundamentalists alike.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. Once I fell in love with the first one I knew this one was going to be great! I just love the whole plot and idea for the book. And then the author writes in a beautiful way that ties everything together. I would recommend this book to anyone into the dystopian type of novel.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|This is the best combo package and great price i have received and i have over 450 DVD i love it

1608955702|5.0|Neil knows what he's talking about and explains his techniques clearly with good examples. This goes into enough detail to make a big difference in how to deal with a wide variety of lighting situations. Highly recommended.
B004VYYA2K|4.0|Pros: fun Barbie design, fits a TON of Barbies and accessories, unzips to reveal a playmat<br />Neutral: kid probably won't play with playmat much<br />Cons: box doesn't fit anywhere conveniently, zippers not easy enough for my daughter to zip on her own<br /><br />Result: definitely worth considering for storage
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm sold. I haven't ventured yet into the New Adult genre but it's one I've been meaning to try out, especially due to it's recent popularity. Featuring more serious issues and romances that young adult novels rarely venture, it's an interesting change.<br /><br />Hopeless is an endearing, shocking, and strangely heart-warming novel. It slowly envelops us into the story of a girl named Sky who feels nothing for guys even when she's making out with them. Her mother has shielded her from technology and public schools ever since she was adopted at 6, and it's her first time going into public school with a reputation of sleeping around.<br /><br />Then she meets Dean Holder, a guy who has a temper and a reputation rivalling her own. He's a high school drop out who was thrown into juvi for a hate crime, after beating a gay guy up at school. Holder envokes strange feelings of lust and passion that she's never felt before, and even though she's confused by his strange, violent outbursts and foreign behaviour, she can't stay away. As it turns out, Holder is the person who will change her life forever and uncover secrets that she has kept hidden away all of her life.<br /><br />Hopeless slowly draws you in and before you know it, you're heavily invested in Sky and Holder. It's told in a very intimate way which I've never quite encountered with such intensity before, with the chapter's set out like Sky's diary with all of her emotions, thoughts and confusion laid out to bare. Interactions between her and Holder are intense, passionate and powerful. It's clear the two have a connection that many other literary couples cannot rival.<br /><br />From picking up the book from its humble beginnings, the journey that it takes you on is not one I would have anticipated. But amazing nonetheless, and my heart breaks for the suffering that these two teenagers have gone through. The author handles shocking and disturbing subject matters very elegantly and realistically, and kudos her for being able to do so.<br /><br />This is not a book you pick up when you're feeling like a light read or a simple romance. It's one that will tear you up, make you smile, break your heart, and realise how lucky you are for what you have. Hopeless is a book that stays on your mind long after you've read it and you'll be hooked.<br /><br />I can't wait to read Losing Hope, the 2nd in the series which has just been released. Due to heavily mature content, sexual situations and language, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone below 17.<br /><br />I received this book from the publisher via Readplus in exchange for an honest review, which has been cross-posted on the site. Check out my Happy Indulgence blog for more reviews! [...]being able to do so.<br /><br />This is not a book you pick up when you're feeling like a light read or a simple romance.

B0096BIENY|5.0|This is a keeper!  If you love these voices, this 2 cd pack gives you so many wonderful songs from this group.  I had just seen them in concert in Omaha and some of the first few songs were ones they opened with.  A wonderful memory of a great night.  In concert, all of them are featured singing alone...I really loved that.  This is one of the greatest quartets ever!!!!!!
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|love the book. movies goes by the book in some ways. I was looking for beorn to be in the movie but wasn't . one of my fav. charactors in the movie. I thought it was the whole movie until the end. when it ended at smog. but great movie. can't wait for hobbit 2.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have never been so utterly disappointed in a book before!!! I was counting down the days until this book came out and I even pre-orded it because I just couldn't wait. And the book wasn't anything at all like I wanted it to be!! I would of been happier if the crossfire novels just ended at the second book. I am so done with this author and done with the Crossfire novel!!!!!
125000098X|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a fabulous writer.  Best Kept Secret is the third book of a trilogy and I hope there is a fourth book.  Can't wait to see what happens next.  I have read most all of the Jeffrey Archer books and they are all excellent.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|I love classic novels, and this collection is great! Definitely worth the money to have them available to read on the go.
B006VY0SEW|5.0|The best way I can describe it is kind of like Elliot Smith but in her own way. Beautiful songs. And the vinyl version just sounds amazing. I would say buy it.
1577314808|5.0|I can honestly say this book has completely changed my life.  I was going to leave my husband and my life and move to California, because I wasn't content and couldn't get out of my head.  After reading it, I am content, happy, at peace and excited that I am choosing to stay with the man I love.  He is thrilled with my transformation.  I don't complain and want to live.  Before I also really didn't care if I died, because in my mind, I had nothing to live for.  I was in such a dark place.  After reading the first 20 pages, I was blown away.  I've heard the phrase &#34;live in the moment&#34; countless times, but the way Eckhart Tolle wrote about it and kept reinforcing the point, it finally sunk in.  I don't have to worry about the past or future.  I can enjoy now and deal with it or change what I can.  I am so happy that my sister introduced me to this book. I cannot give it enough praise.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game gets you to think and use your head. It is very fun. It makes you feel like a detective. Sometimes it gets hard but your brain will figure it out eventually.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Reading this book created the biggest ache in my chest because of the irresponsible events that lead to the shunning of Nikola Teslas ideas. The only phrase I can think of is the idea of wealth over altruism. Mr. Tesla was the complete opposite. He was prepared to give the world a gift. I cannot help but think where we would be today had he not been so betrayed. The world would be competing for ideas, not energy.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I gave this book five stars, because I was literally hanging onto every word through the entire story. When I had to put the book down, I couldn't get it off of my mind - I could not wait to pick it up and start reading where I had left off.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My wife and I rented this one and it was a great watch!  Very funny!  The story, while predictable, was filled with dialogue that would amuse the young as well as the mature.  Well worth a fun feel good experience.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Captivating story and characters. This tale unfolds character by character, you discover the ripple effects that one event can have and how it manifests differently in the lives of those involved.
B008EKOIN8|4.0|He always brings up points I had not thought about. Any one who eats should read Pollan's work. His work is rather sobering.
B000929AJQ|5.0|If you like NIN then you won't be disappointed. The entire album is interesting, moody, and just as good as the singles.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is to Hugh Howey, who promised that he reads all his Amazon reviews: great book, I hope you keep it up!<br /><br />I'm currently buying the next on the other Chrome tab, and highly recommend all you other readers do the same.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Before you complain about things like this, you should learn how to use your machines. You can set your blu ray devices and gaming systems to not allow this content. Embrace the google people. This movie is a hoot and gets better with every viewing.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|It is a really fun game but it is a little bit hard. You can cut it change the color. You can shave and gule the hair back on.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I'm very happy with this purchase. I enjoy that they go all the way over my ears, and the wound cord makes for no tangles.
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|Not funny, not scary, not romantic, just boring, no plot to follow wasted my money, no one wanted to watch the whole thing.
B0081336FO|2.0|I seriously love it SO much.  If you've never seen it, watch it.<br /><br />I am giving this 2 stars because I accidentally clicked &#34;buy the season&#34; rather than buy the one episode I wanted and now can't return it.  I already own episode 1...so please tell me why I had to pay the entire price for the full season?  I'm disappointed in Amazon for not having a &#34;complete the season&#34; option like iTunes has.  I don't understand why they don't.  So I paid $21.64 + $7.57 for Sherlock Season 2.  Come on Amazon...I bought from you because I wanted to support your digital effort.  Now I'm wishing I hadn't.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really liked the work.  Reads quickly, despite being a bit long.  Doesn't feel that way at all, however.  If only things could have worked out the way King helps us imagine it.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|Love Ben.  Wish he could answer answer questions.  All in all he is a mood changer.  Anything that can make my grandkids or me smile is a good thing!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|As someone who saw the film first, I was a bit surprised at some changes but the changes are what give the story life. I love this book and the inspiration it brings to even me, a teenage girl who could never imagine such emotion. I recommend this to anyone that believes we are the most powerful forces on Earth.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Its the best game ever when it works.it sometimes  pauses and sometimes it will not let you play it. So its Booo and Yahh
B0024FAG5I|4.0|There is a strong female character, which made it more interesting than most westerns.  There is a great deal of shooting and killing, as one would expect.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think this game is really fun and a good game for kids. It has missions and much more for you to check out.Anyway hope you enjoy this game.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|If the academy liked it, why shouldn't you. A compelling story, although the people in the movie that supposed to be crazy looked pretty sane to me.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This soft is wonderful for readering Office's document. but it's short for screen PPT. So, I hope it can do better at the future!
B00CL50LEC|4.0|This is perhaps the cutest zombie Fiction ever.  It's even better that love is the cure to thier affliction.  They say that love is stronger than any curse and This story has taken that and applied it in a very scientific way that is amazing and cute and even sometimes funny I like.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed the game very much.  It's been awhile since my old mind was challenged and it was refreshing.  Keep the levels coming.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|I love Jim Carrey, he is by far my idol when it comes to actor's and to top it all off he's teh only one I can remember the name of.  Weird right?  Everyone be like Vin deisel and I be like who?  but as soon as I hear Jim Carrey I am all over it.  That's right.  I am a huge Jim Carrey fan even though I do not own Jim Carrey Memoribilia I have watch all the movies and will soon own them all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|VERY very great game for young kids. My 8 year old son and I sit and play this often. I would definitely recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a great addicting game but I wish that they can fix some of the glitches it has bc each time I play it takes awhile for it to load.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I can't buy applications so I got this.. even for a demo it's amazing. It's not EXACTLY Minecraft, but it's close to it. Thanks to the creator. (WARNING: You only get a day to play-possibly more-, so anything you create will be deleted unless you get the full version.)
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was very interesting! I'd recommend it to most of my friends. I do think it ended without a conclusion but that's what the second boom is for. Overall it was a great read

1781164266|5.0|I gave this book a 5/5 because it has great art and is well narrated and gives good info on the design ideas the team had and used to make the game. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loved the game or is interested in the art of this game or concept are in general.
B000A0GP18|5.0|I bought this DVD for my younger brother and considering the fact it was used, it still looks new. My brother could care less about whether it's old or new, all that matters is that the movie can play smoothly. He is joyful now that he has it. I am currently preparing for a night of laughs :)
B00881VLCE|4.0|I have never been into puzzles before I started to play this game! This game is truly addicting I always play it until my kindle dies!!!!!!!

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was never one for fantasy fiction, but after reading this novel, I have changed my attitude completely.  Loved the way the chapters were set up by character - and what characters they were!  As far as I'm concerned, Mr.Martin is a genius - I cannot put this book down.  He has created a world completely believable, One I would like to visit - but not stay - I need my indoor plumbing!<br />A remarkable book - It recalls the novels I've read about the Cousins war.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I loved this book! It was wonderful for my imagination and wonder. It was a short but very enjoyable read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You absolutely must have this app! It is kind of a mixture of temple run and subway surfers but I personally like it better than both of those games.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book.  It doesn't go to the places you think. It surprises you.  Very well-written, interesting, and does not disappoint.
B001JIDE3M|4.0|fun and quirky. adventure and humor.  this &#34;sci-fi&#34; movie is a great family one.  kids of all ages can enjoy- parents as well.
B00AVL23YE|2.0|At the beginning I liked this app.  I got it to retrieve emails from my Hotmail account.  I could select emails and delete a grouping.  It had lots to like about it but after a using it for about a month, it started asking if I wanted to update.  When I selected Yes, it took me to the Amazon app place where the only option was to uninstall or open.  After a couple weeks of this, not getting anywhere, I started getting \\"Must Be Logged into Amazon App Store to Run\\".  What a bother.  I'm already logged in.  I uninstalled it and reinstalled it.  Ran smooth for the first month then a repeat of the same behavior.  I'm deleting it all together and will be looking for something else.
B000001FV1|3.0|I have never liked this album, probably because I heard the live album \\"On the Road\\" first. The production is poor, the vocals sound thin and the mix is awful. The live versions of these songs are much better. The live version of \\"Sometimes (I Feel So) Uninspired\\" is one of my favorite Traffic songs. Here it sounds flat. The live versions of Tragic Magic and the title track are also much better.<br /><br />I started listening to Traffic in 1967 and in my view they made a mistake when they jettisoned the production skills of Jimmy Miller. Miller also worked with the Stones during their great 1968-1973 period. The first two Traffic albums were well produced and you could actually hear Chris Wood's sax/flute playing. Shoot Out also sounds like old man's rock music, it lacks energy, but also the virtuosity of most other British bands of that period. Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman were the current hotshots on keyboards. Jimmy Page, Steve Howe, and Richie Blackmore were the top guitarists. Winwood sounds pedestrian in comparison.<br /><br />Traffic's other great live album \\"Welcome to the Canteen\\" was recorded 5 months earlier with Dave Mason on guitar, Rich Grech (bass), and Jim Gordon (drums), but they were gone for this outing. Roger Hawkins (drums) and David Hood (bass) from Muscle Shoals came in as replacements. Losing the songwriting talent of Dave Mason was a mistake, he wrote some of the best songs on the second Traffic album and I love his two tracks on Welcome to the Canteen. Mason was often getting fired from Traffic. I watched an interview with Winwood on You Tube where he avoided mentioning Dave by name. He described him as someone who was with the band in the early days, it was clear they didn't get along. By this time Traffic had become Winwood's backing band and in my view he needed others to share the load.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is so heartfelt. Made me laugh and cry. Have tissues ready for the tears. So glad my granddaughter shared it with me.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love the ability to choose the amount of decks that you play with. I prefer the challenges. This is a game I can play at night just to relax ~~and I also love how I can play it in the car on road trips.

B00CM9JKQM|4.0|The best way I can describe the legal/musical mess over the past year is having parents on the verge of a divorce. I was waiting to find out who loved me more, Geoff or everyone else. My basic scale for a good album is, can I grab any song off it and play it on its own merits, and can I play the entire album without skipping anything, both or either in my car, sitting in traffic, with the volume at \\"11\\". I really wanted to like Geoff's album, politics aside, and really tried, but to date there is only 1 song I keep in rotation (Cold). I think he'll do just fine on his own, but I think he lost the right to take ownership of the Queensryche brand when he went in a direction no one else seemed to want to go. If the quality and frequency (ha ha) of ratings between the two albums on Amazon is representative of market acceptance, I think we all know who the judge will be pointing at when the dust settles.<br /><br />That being said, I was relieved beyond words when I started listening to this disc. Is it Mindcrime? No. Mindcrime was one of those rare lightning-strikes like The Wall, something based on skill and circumstance you could never duplicate and shouldn't try. But, even my ignorant ears can tell the guys are enjoying what they are doing. Listen to the last 4 albums in a row, finish with this one and tell me some kind of chains weren't broken. It's not the best they're capable of, it was made on the fly just like Geoff's, but this is a return to form and I haven't stopped playing it for over a week.<br /><br />One of the biggest arguments in favor of the last several albums from the band has been that they are a progressive band and so each album was an experiment. Okay, by that argument, they are now experimenting with a return to form. Without Geoff. Sure Todd sounds kind of like Geoff. As another poster mentioned, that makes sense for a concert venue--no one wants to hear Michael Stipe warbling Take Hold of the Flame. Four stars because it was rushed and has some sound issues, but if I could add .5 stars for the goodies included in the box I would. I love that stuff, and it shows class despite the pressure to release their music quickly.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I started using Evernote mainly for my genealogy notes on all my devices: computer, laptop, smart phone & kindle, but quickly branched out into all aspects of my life. I had first used One Note but didn't  like the complexity it required to sync between devices; l very quickly switched to Evernote and almost immediately went to the Premium version. Haven't regretted it since; I just wish the kindle had a web clipper for when I wanted to clip items from my genealogy magazines. Will we ever be able to do sub-folders? That would be a nice feature to have as well.  But I now wonder how I ever got along without Evernote!

0062059963|3.0|In this one, I ended up angry and confused at the end.  Aspen was annoying.  He said he had America's best interests at heart and he worried for her but he kept putting her in dangerous situations.  Maxon... I don't know what his deal is.  I really don't.  While I agree that America tends to get mad and lose it, I don't think it is too much to ask to be someone's one and only.  You love many people who come into your life but in the end, for most of us, there is one love that rises above all the others and stays.  I don't think Maxon gets that.  His inability to kick Celeste to the curb would be a deal breaker for me.  I have had to deal with her kind in my marriage and I have no sympathy for girls like that.  I'd put them all on a one-way cruise to Antarctica if I could.  I don't care much for men who think with their junk or who just don't care to see that they are ruining something huge for a manipulative girl.  But enough about that.  The king was just disgusting.  He was.  I hope he gets what he has coming to him in the third book or I will build a small fire and burn the whole series.  I seriously hate that guy.  All in all, I want to read the third book just to see if the author can end it and not make me want to set fire to the rain because right now, the book has me hopping mad at the injustice of it all.

B006DRVFRQ|2.0|This started out as an app that was working well then after like a month it's just stopped working. It repeatedly gives me an invalid message when it unsuccessfully attempts to update. I reported the problem threw the app and was told to try downloading it again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|When watching this series,there are happy times ,sad times,but it was like stepping back in time. A wonderful experience to see.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Minecraft is bum every thing is a block its bum I don't NO a loser that would ever buy this game.
B004742Y68|5.0|The definitive horror move of the 1980's.  Nostalgia filled, it's a scary move done right.  If you've heard of a house being built on a burial ground, this is the movie for you.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|7/15/13 Updated to add I am now able to load the game and play it. Thankfully there was an update and all is okay on the Kindle. Unfortunately, as much as I like the game, I am still taking two stars away because there is still an annoying intro sequence to each game. I have to click a few times before I can select \\"play again\\". And event hen, the loading is forever...plus there is the intro where the minion is sent flying. Cute, but wastes time just to play a game. It's what keeps me from playing this often and why I go to Subway Surfers or Temple Run.<br />-----<br />I like the game, it's cute, fun, but now it doesn't work on my Kindle Fire HD. The first couple days it loaded, then yesterday it would load and immediately close. Today, the game froze on loading and I had to reboot my Kindle.<br /><br />About game play when it actually worked, as I was going to give it a three-star review before the loading issues happened. I like the game...once you're playing. But the extended lead-up to game play EVERY single game (the minion being shot up, grabbing on to other minions and then thrown) annoys me. This is already on top of the multiple touches/clicks and then more loading before I can play again. Temple Run, Subway Surfers, they let you play another game, immediately, and that's why I was hooked on them. While I like the game, I definitely do not love it and probably won't play it as much. They would probably get more people to purchase items it the game wasn't so slow.<br /><br />All points moot, considering I can't even load the game now.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I enjoyed this one just a much a the others. Always surprising. You just never know what's around the next corner.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I didn't expect liking World War Z as much as I did! I think the writing was great the way Max Brooks captures the different mindsets of the characters so well, I'm amazed that he is only one author! You get the feeling this war has happened because of the details both in feelings but maybe more importantly so the strategics of warfare against the undead.<br />  I loved the book from beginning to end.

B005MMY9A8|5.0|Good viewing ... Great action .... A good movie for all , which twists and turns and makes you want more ..
B0089LOG02|5.0|This story lets you experience how hard a childhood can be and the struggles that can be overcome. Unbelievable what a young child can survive.
B00AG297GK|2.0|Not a enjoyable Movie even for adults .... call it not a &#34; B &#34; but a low &#34; C &#34; type movie
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|In a sea of Freemium garbage, this title was a blast!  It's a paid app that's worth it!  Some might be put off by the old school graphics, but hang in there its great.  It's a hybrid match 3 and rpg game.  Yes, you can beat it without paying any more!!!
B007N0REX6|5.0|I love anything Slash :) but it's great how he keeps evolving his style. I love all the songs. Rock on :-D :-D
B00CH26TL8|2.0|The graphics are pleasing, but the game play is quite boring, in my opinion.  The need to buy more bubbles is pretty sad - I played long enough to find out to give the game a fair chance!  Try it for free, you might like it and not be concerned about forking over money to keep going!
B0064BWDRW|5.0|This is a great series written in a wonderful gritty and engaging style. Hand to put it down. Highly recommended.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|I had heard a lot about this book from friends of mine and didn't think it could live up to their praises, but when I finally got around to reading it I totally agreed with everything they had to say. Looking forward to the sequels/prequels.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Edward Norton is great (as usual) in this mysterious movie, Jessica Biel did really well in this too, it was well casted, great soundtrack that really went well with the scenes, very good writing and just very well done and clever movie.  There was another movie that came out around the same time this one did called the Prestige, that movie did not even compare to the greatness of this movie ymmv.
B0085PFG1U|4.0|This is a powerful and intuitive graphing calculator which will help you with your algebra and calculus. It could improve on some small things to make it easier to the user, but overall it does the job very well and is totally worth it.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|This movie is the bomb...This  flick has the greatest car/truck chase in it that I have ever seen with fantastic special effects....
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this product. It seems somewhat difficult to set upright on its own. Otherwise I have no complaints. It is lightweight, which to me is a plus as I have arthritic hands.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Great movie with an electrifying plot...They just got through in time...I hope more of you will buy this flick as it is worth at least a used Blu-ray price....
B0087IT8FK|4.0|the movie is ok i wasn't as impressed with it as some other movies i've seen i wouldnt watch it again
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Great movie with an energetic story line based on a true event. Acting was great with actors picked well for their respective parts...
B001EN71DG|5.0|Nothing annoyed me more than listening to the different music on the newer version of the movies.  Now, I finally have the originals.
B0091REZMW|3.0|it is early to rate I just downloaded but it is just ok so far. I hope the game is fun.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I have read 3 of Anthony Bourdain's books and thoroughly enjoyed all of them. His irreverent way of dealing with things and the way he expresses himself makes it a fun read. A look at the inside of a business most of us have no clue about.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game. Makes you think at times. Just started, so I hope it gets know challenging. I'll keep going to see.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|I enjoyed this book but was more then a little amazed at all the &#34;stuff&#34; that this character found himself involved in. A European rendition of a Forrest Gump-ish tale.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I have seen this movie several times on STARZ and knew my granddaughter would love it too.  So, now we can enjoy it together many times over.  The story is filled with love, suspense, charm and laughter.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Third Magic the Gathering game I have owned and it does not disappoint.  Love the new booster pack system, something I have wanted to see in the game since I first played Duels of the Planeswalkers.  Looks absolutely amazing on my Kindle Fire HD.  I was afraid after playing my Steam version that the graphics and gameplay would be disappointing but they far exceeded my expectations.  Good value for the price.<br /><br />Eeyoreprime
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Only wish it had a little more in depth weather report. If the six to ten day forecast offered more detail, that would be awesome!
B00CP2Z5TC|1.0|I was excited about this release, but could not have been more let down.<br /><br />contrived, and redundant songs with cheap lyrics. you would be better off buying an ★NSYNC album.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|You just have to guess what things/combinations you need. Many of the items can be clicked on but do not have an item at all.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wow... what can I say, so far is one of the best app to keep my 5 year old busy... he wants to play this game over and over, and talks about how to play the game. He wants to teach all of us to play. I even had to download it to my phone, I really recommend it to everyone who loves this type of games...

1451695195|3.0|In due respect to a person with a brilliant mind and capacity to learn and serve, I suggest Dr. Alexander participate in one of the courses of the Teaching Company. The course is Skepticism 101:How to Think Like a Scientist. I appreciate his sharing of his experience, to an extent I add, and also state that I do not view the contents to correlate with the title which, because of being written by a trained physician, I made the false and naïve assumption there would be something of what I believe to be \\"scientific proof.\\" And yes, we all know, that even among scientists there are differences in opinion and belief but at least there is usually a more close adaptation of their reported findings to that of an empirical paradyme. In this case, I find that to be missing. If he should decide to \\"enroll\\" in the Teaching Company course, I wish him the best. I also extend to all readers of the meaning of proof as set in an empirical model.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|No problems! I have this app on all my devices and I haven't had a problem yet.  Definitely a great app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|HIGHLY recommended to play. Lots of fun with no stupid &quot;energy&quot; or &quot;coin&quot; system. Easily addictive and fun. Play this game.

B0049J0DC8|4.0|Good kids movie, I remember watching this as a kid and now my kids watch and love this movie, all though they could of done with out 2 and 3
B004HD61KE|4.0|If you haven't read other Sigma Force novels, you may be a bit confused by what Sigma is, what the Guild is and about the relationships/characters of the Signma Force members. I must say this wasn't my favorite Sigma Force novel. The topics, facts were interesting and compelling, but there was more divided action and seemed a bit more disjointed than past novels. As usual, though, i loved learned the facts behind the fiction and it made me want to go research it some more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the greatest game I have ever played. I believe that Gameloft should make a Despicable Me: Minion Rush 2. That is how fun this game is.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|I like Bruce Willis and I liked the first Die Hard movie.............. but this one was not good.  Constant shooting and car crashes!  Very boring movie for women!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|you have to have read the previous two books about the Clifton Chronicles to enjoy this book. I could not put it down. It was amazing to read on about the family I had come to love so much and as per usual, true to Jeffrey Archer form, we were left with a cliffhanger. Hope fully there will be a fourth book and I will know what happened??????????????
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is an AMAZING show!!!  Don't forget to watch the commentary!!! - it's all sung!!!  Now if only Joss could get Firefly back!
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|I have seen only one other filmed version of \\"The Tempest\\", the BBC version, and I agree with others who say that in spite of a good cast lead by great Shakespearean actor, Michael Hordern, it is flat and visually uninteresting. That is a good place to start when speaking of this film, shot on two Hawaiian islands, including the volcanic regions on the big island. The scenery is gorgeous and perfectly befitting the play. The landscape tends to put the humans in proper perspective. Little.<br /><br />The great background is enhanced by a touch of special effects, especially in the presentation of the spirit, Ariel. In the background piece, it was reported that Ben Whishaw, the actor who played Arial, would not be available when the company went to Hawaii. So, many of his parts are inserted by special effect, which has the benefit of giving him a very spectral quality.<br /><br />If the special effects and the landscape do anything unfortunate, it is to shrink Prospera in comparison. Either though direction, camera work, or acting, Prospera the magician simply does not come off with the gravitas of Gandalf in LOTR (even though he rarely uses magic.) Prospera's effects are spectacular. It almost seems as if Prospera were played by an even slighter actress, the contrast would have been so great as to make a strong impression.<br /><br />Caliban is Ariel's opposite, earthy in the extreme. In the BBC production, the Caliban character was covered with a stringy, weedy costume which tended to obscure his reactions to the camera. You can almost recognize Djimon Hounsou as the Nubian who played Russell Crowe's fellow gladiator in the movie of that name. Between his natural skin color and makeup, it appears he is caked with mud.<br /><br />Caliban's two henchmen from the storm-tossed ship are two of Shakespeare's great fool characters, Trinculo and Stefano, played to perfection by Russell Brand and Alfred Molina. It just may be that this trio steals the show from Mirren. But Mirren gives a great performance, outdoing Hordern easily. As director Julie Taymor notes, it was simple to change the male character Prospero to Prospera, as it was no more than changing a few pronouns. Far, far easier, for example, than changing King Lear or Hamlet to a woman.<br /><br />The love interest is played by Reeve Carney as Ferdinand, Alonso's son, who falls in love with Miranda, Prospera's daughter, played by felicity Jones. Like many of Shakespeare's romances, they tend to be less interesting than the fools and the perils of the plot. Neither seem accomplished actors, although they carry their parts reasonably well, in this, one of the Himalayas  of English language theatre.<br /><br />The four noblemen are played well by Chris Cooper as Antonio, Prospera's brother and Miranda's uncle, Alan Cumming as Sebastian - Alonso's brother, Tom Conti as Gonzalo, a counselor to Alonso, who gave aid to Prospera and Miranda<br />David Strathairn as Alonso, King of Naples, but I confess, Shakespeare has saved the best parts for the fools and the young lovers.<br /><br />The overall effect makes this possibly the only Tempest worth watching.<br /><br />One yearns to see what The Tempest would look like with Ian McKellen in the lead, after his long run as that most famous wizard, Gandalf.irren gives a great performance, outdoing Hordern easily.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I totally love this game it is so much fun. And the dialogue and the little video scenes are so funny. I would recommend this to anyone who like this kind of game. Because I sure love it. Download it and have fun.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Just finished Winter of the World, it's right up there with Pillars of the Earth as the best I've ever read.  Can't wait for the 3rd of the series.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Not as complex as American Gods but takes you into the depths of reality as only Gaiman can do.  Entertaining and fun.
1934030198|5.0|This the book to have to do a long course or an ironman triathlon. Great on technical details. This is a must have for any serious attempts to do the course.
B000JCQCW4|2.0|I guess I should have looked up what the word requiem means.  I didn't, and the met this movie headlong.  This movie was sad... So sad and a little scary.  I wish there were a more hopeful message at its conclusion but alas, there were no condolences.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It would be nice if something like this was true.  I loved reading the book.  My nose was in it all the time

B00CH26TL8|2.0|Game is a little dull. Doesn't give you much time to read the info between screens. Good thing it was free.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|If you're a fan of Fall Out Boy, then I recommend you buying this. Its different from their other albums you'll either like it or maybe not.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun for me and my kids! We love the minions! SO MUCH FUN!!! Great game
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Excellent and addictive. This simple game puts your brain to work in a very fun way. I recommend it without hesitation
B001OMJGD0|4.0|I find this movie better than Man of Steel mainly because this is actually a superman movie. It is probably a little too campy and I have some issues with the plot, but overall when I finished the movie, I didn't want to curse everyone who made this.
B008J34466|5.0|Just what I expected from Pink - smart, edgy, truthful, honest, powerful, and immensely entertaining. If the fowl language puts you off, you will miss the wisdom and invitation to a healthier life here. Amazing Pink!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is fun I love it, it is exiting and crazy people are crazy if they dnt ever play this this game because it goes to different levels which makes it me fun
B006M4RN3U|3.0|Three good songs. The others are hard to listen to and quite different from the hits. Cutting edge or odd?
B00006AGGY|1.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband and it would not play on my DVD player, my PS3 and laptop.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's a fun game but even with constant updates of new cities it gets repetitive. The collectibles in the game keep it interesting a little longer.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I love this CD and was so happy to be able to buy it. Someone stole it from me before I am hiding this copy
098555780X|4.0|The book has good colour pictures which helps when trying to follow step by step the diagrams. Great variation of knots to learn.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This is one of my favorite TV series and I really enjoyed watching this series from beginning to end. :)
1781162646|4.0|Took a while to get to the point, but worth the trip.  I thought the book was going to be a murder mystery.  Turned out to be a coming of age, getting over the girl book with a murder mystery back story.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Great movie, watched it several times with family. Looks great on my HD tv. Great product from amazon. And the price is great.
B004QKNXIQ|1.0|the download was no good. i could not view video.<br /><br />i would like a full refund immediately.<br /><br />thank you for your attention.
B00CA4S27W|4.0|I enjoy Blackmore's Night a lot; however, this album has too many songs that sound the same. From their previous releases, I know that they have a more diverse range of song styles. Candace and Ritchie still show their strengths in music, but I wish they'd expressed their diversity.<br /><br />The combo pack is a nice touch.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and was pleasantly surprised. Now, I'll have to watch the movie.<br />I will recommend this book to a friend.
B000031EGV|5.0|This is a great movie, one that both kids and their parents can enjoy.  It will be a classic, along the lines of The Wizard of Oz and the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  I remember being a little scared by flying monkeys the first time I saw the Wizard of Oz, but that's part of the fun. My kids, ages 7 to 11, love this movie.  I think my kids could easily tell the animals were not real. But if your kids tend to frighten easily, they could be scared by the giant mosquitoes.  I liked the lessons learned by Robin Williams' character, Alan, and Alan's father - Understand that your parents are trying to do what they think is best, but if you don't agree, talk it out; take time to listen to your kids, love them and really appreciate them. Overall, a great film with all the actors doing a fantastic job.
B00D8OHPF8|4.0|This CD is really good. When you first listen to it you are like &#34;it's alright&#34; but then you place from start to finish it jams. I highly recommend this CD for the &#34;Grown and Sexy&#34; and others!
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|Its a good album, and I like how they are developing their style. Less thrashy than their first few albums.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I had heard about magic before but hadn't ever ever bought anything so couldn't try it. Was really nice to be able to try it and now I am hooked on it. It's worth the free try you might get hooked like me.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is among the best books by Neil Gaiman I have read. A wonderful tale that I had a hard time putting down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love it and it s so fun people out thare git this game it fun pleads make a hither palfrey for people so it more funner
B004V5A7K8|2.0|This game is not as good as others I have played. Plus others were free. The controls were kinda poor. When you lose a ball you cannot move the paddle before releasing the next ball. Also cannot catch the last prizes after breaking the last block on a level. Graphics look really low tech. 99 levels did not take long to beat. Save your money and find a better free app.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I started to like the two angst-y teens but often I began to dislike Hazel. Her struggle with the falseness of others just rubbed me wrong and instead I saw her as nothing but a whiny teen that wanted her way, which adjust annoyed the crud out of me. I think the story itself was beautifully written and it painted such vivid imagines in my imagination, so that's why I am indifferent.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Very good acting on all actors but could not follow or understand, over my head i guess. If you like good acting only this is for you but if you like a plot good luck.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|very good game I like it easy to play good progression interesting combination of animale easy to get started very good for a free game
B00A7MSHHO|1.0|Bought this Michael Keaton Batman action figure for my grandson's third birthday.<br />My grandson loves his tub time with his toys. Often times, we will just leave him by himself for hours in the tub. He was pretty excited to take Batman into the tub, but cape rotted off sitting in the bathtub the first week.<br />The second week he lost it in the kitty litter/sandbox in the backyard. No one was in the back yard with him when it happened. We were never quite sure what happened to it for about a week. It was not until the third week that either the rain or one of the the dogs had brought it back into the house.<br />During the fourth week my loving life partner Steve and I brought my grandson to the \\"Jumpin For Jesus\\" rainbow pride revival. After one of the standing up, jumping, dancing and finally sitting numbers, Steve sat right on the Batman figure. The figure broke into several pieces immediately. Now, I know Steve is a bit on the heavy side for black man (he has to pay for two seats when he travels on public transportation) but the figure should of been protected my the sheer size of his tender full back side.<br />They simply do not make toys like they used to.<br />I recommend getting a Kenner Toys  movie Keaton Batman figure if you want something durable.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Damn! Tom really brought it, either it's him or his wife working with him or even Mrs. Keifer doing the magic.  I was surprised by the variety and well textured of this album.  Really loved Fool's Paradise and Ask Me Yesterday.  I own very few albums to which, I don't have the necessity to skip a track, this one has joined that list.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|This book was a surprise but it has both cooking tips and other advice that struck me as useful.  I am glad I read it and recommend it for virtually everyone who enjoys cooking.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Blade Runner has been dethroned. Finally we have work worthy of the brand after 30 years of waiting. Urban is awesome as Dredd as is Thirlby as Anderson. The slow motion action is chaotic yet hypnotic. Thank you for keeping the helmet on and the dialogue simple, this is Dredd at its purest. There must be a sequel. With this approach anything is possible... Strontium Dog, ABC Warriors, Rogue Trooper!
B00BLSAM3A|5.0|Outstanding - they don't make movies like this anymore. Now it's all politically correct b.s. and boring pap with endless sequels of crappy movies.
0811879542|3.0|wasn't expecting it to be so instructional. thought it would be some quirky story or something. nonetheless, i've yet to use this on my baby so am hoping she'll enjoy it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This solitaire seemed to be very easy to win.  I didn't like all the popup advertisment; had to skip them each time to continue to play.
B004TJ1H3C|3.0|So much potential but ended with a cliffhanger. This is the last season of the series and the producers left this season to the imagination. Perhaps some would like that but for me, I would have liked to see the true ending.
B005T87QCI|5.0|This game is really fun you can play as your favorite characters from the movie but lookout for update it doesn't, update on its own.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Easy to read guide that comes with easy to follow instructions to get your book published. Well worth the effort to buy and read.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This is a great series. It is fun to watch. Dexter is fascinatingly chilling to watch. I look forward to every episode.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|An easy to read uncomplicated journey. You feel like you are walking side by side with Harold on his adventures.<br />Relates to all of us, our regrets,love,compassion,misgivings.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Once again, Nicholas Sparks does not disappoint. I loved the characters and, as always, I was crying by the end.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|Heard this on Pandora. thought to myself, how cool this sounds. So I bought it. I am very impressed with it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really enjoyed about 3/4 of this book but began to get annoyed because it starting getting bogged down and predictable. It's worth a read but was too long.
B000063WDH|4.0|Cool groovy sound. Music sounds like it could've bbeen made at just about any time in rock history. It not just rock though. It sounds ......... cool
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i got this and started playing 4 the next 2 hrs. like 2 days after it stopped working but i un-downloded it and i just redownloaded it hope it.works! !!! love this app
B001OKGN2E|4.0|Mr Russel killed it with this movie. It's a complete movie. One of the best things about this picture is the concept. About an outdated, obsolete man can be relevant to others and even for himself. A cool way to show  how real humanity will survive in any situation. You can't destroy heart.
B00006CXSS|5.0|We happened to catch part of the series a couple of years ago and recorded the full series over time.  With the loss of another DVR  we couldn't find it again.  I decided to surprise my husband and get it.  Both of our fathers were in the war and we have some of the memorabilia that they both brought back.  This series is fantastic.
034537410X|5.0|It is even better than i expected, the scientific way of writing of this book makes the already interesting topic of lucid dreaming more rational and reachable. This is an excellent help to inducing lucid dreaming, as well as combating nightmares and other practices, that i would recomend to everyone trying to put a foot in this amazing world.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|This is an enjoyable movie.  It is cohesive and the acting is good. Great it is not, but it holds together well and is worth your time.
0439023483|4.0|I liked this book a lot and wanted to get the series. I was glad I was able to still buy a hard cover one.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|This is the least interesting and least well made of the TRANSFORMER movies.  Watched it once, would not watch again and would no go out of my way to recommend it.  Adequate, describes it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Fast shipping! Great quality! This is a keeper !! It fed my Downton obsession very well and swift!! Thanks again, will watch over& over!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed about three quarters of this novel about a marriage that turns sour and hateful after an impossibly cute beginning. The last quarter of the book shows that the author ran out of creative gas and had to coast to the last page pushing the story along. Very disappointing after I'd heard from others and from reviewers that this was one of the best novels of 2012. In the end, it was unnecessarily spiteful and mean.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|A great download for the grand children.  They have loved it and use it a lot now.  they find it quite a challenge.
B00CDV6WDS|2.0|Why are developers still making games that can't be moved? There really is no excuse these days.<br /><br />And its really not that hard to enable.
0061150142|4.0|I'd only read Jodi Picoult's \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" before picking this book up. Amazed at how brilliantly she managed to execute that novel, I decided to give \\"The Pact\\" a chance.<br /><br />I finished it in less than twenty-four hours.<br /><br />I found myself stuck in the garage while my boyfriend fixed his car, and decided to bring this book along. It proved to be the perfect distraction.<br /><br />I'll admit, at first, I felt, it started a little slow. But once you became involved in the entire story, it was hard to put down. I envied Chris and Emily's relationship. And as the story progressed, I pitied both of them and their internal struggles.<br /><br />In the end, I was pleased as punch. Definitely would recommend it.
B001NZEHMS|4.0|Awesome album in my humble opinion. The boys destroyed all of these tracks. One of the best rap albums available.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Who doesn't love Uno?  I like it in real life, I like it on the Xbox, and I like it on the Fire.  Its fun to play and you can see how you are doing against others.  Glad I downloaded it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is great. It is fun,creative,and nothing like I have ever seen before. I would recommend it for people of all ages. Two things: Because it is free it comes with an enormous amount of ads. But if you turn off the wifi they disappear. Also the kindle takes forever to update the game. I still love it and I highly recommend you get it!
0385736002|5.0|Purchased as gift, receiver loved it, added to their collection of Nicholas Flamel books, didn't disappoint, great book, great service
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Wonderful stories with some strong sadness. Stories interconnect, but sometimes left me confused. Writing is so strong and creates empathy with the reader.
B0010X8NF0|1.0|I have no idea what this movie is supposed to be about.  I lasted 1 hour and finally gave up after seeing no apparent end in sight, no point and no hope for anything resembling a plot or characters I could care about.  And what the F was that weird 'short story before feature' thing at the beginning???????? I don't get it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A wonderful minion experience as you play a fantastic &quot;sequel&quot; (I like to call it) after seeing Despicable me 1-2 in this parody of &quot;subway surfers&quot; with the destruction and deception as minions bring it all out on each other with as much despicableness as possible.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This white noise generator is a work of art. I'm very picky about sound loops and this one goes above and beyond.<br /><br />Here are the best parts of this program:<br /><br />1.  I have mixed up to 5 different sounds for a full experience<br />2.  Each sound can be turned up or down to balance with others or play alone<br />3.  You can NOT hear the looping on any sounds<br />4.  Several people have complained that this full version doesn't contain enough sounds. How did they miss them all? Just scroll the page from left to right and see more and more sounds. I can't even count the total number.<br />5.  Scroll to the left to see brain wave enhancement sounds that can also be mixed for a full brainwave experience -- whether you want to relax, concentrate, or drift off to sleep.<br />6.  Custom make your environment based on your dream location or surroundings. If you want to be in the forest, combine birds, a stream, insects and wind to feel like you're there. If you want the ocean, combine waves, wind, and seagulls. If you want a meditation garden, combine wind chimes, soft music, and a heartbeat. You custom design the environment that's right for you, including balancing the sounds for nearness or the feeling of being far away.<br /><br />Thank you, Ipnos Software, for creating this wonderful app. It is phenomenal!
B005HSL626|5.0|i down loaded this to my sons tablet (hes 7) and he absolute loves it. It is better than most games out at least I think so for a child his age. It keeps him entertained when we are traveling and on the go. I recommend it to and for all age groups
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|If you're a Match 3 fan, you know how levels can play too quickly and either you run out of time playing on timed mode or you didn't really need the timed mode to begin with? This game ends all that. I have never been a big fan of playing against the clock so in games like this one, I always select zen mode to give me enough time to think. Just my preference ... your mileage may vary.<br /><br />I love playing this game because once I got to level 35 and above, the levels took about 15 minutes or more to complete EACH! For those of us addicted to Match 3, that's great news! It's not easy to get rid of all the tiles and it makes you feel great when you clear the board.<br /><br />The tiles are very similar in color on most levels so it requires a lot of thinking to make sure you're moving the right tile and not trying to match two tiles that aren't the same. But the tiles are different enough that you have to pay attention and give it a second look. :)<br /><br />The game has 100 levels divided into 10 sections with 10 levels per section. You receive a new PowerUp piece at the completion of each level. So you have to work with the PowerUps you've been given. It's fun to collect them and use them when they're needed. (When you play you'll know what I mean.)<br /><br />All in all, this game has lots of variety, challenge, reward, and fun. I keep it handy for those times when I'm bored or trying to solve a mental problem. This is a great way for me to ponder a mental challenge while still doing something. I love it!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great graphics, lots of fun building the dragon lairs. Was a bit disappointed at growth time for somethings but a very well written game that is fun for the entire family.
B00847KFDS|1.0|anything fogerty does has to be great!! he choose great artists to compliment him. and the different versions are as good as the original versions .; they would hits intheir own right.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Really opens your eyes to the situation facing quadriplegics. Funny and touching. I highly recommend it to anyone.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Wow I cannot believe the deal I got for this item.  I had made my boyfriends bday memorable and he will forever be greatful for this purchase!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Beautifully blinding as we are thrusted into heathcliffs and cathys tormented love.  A love so unyielding and powerful that it tears everything apart that may prove to thwart its design
0425263924|5.0|Sexy romance at it's finest. I hope it's not the last book! I was left wanting more. So many loose ends that need their story told. I NEED to know. Loved it!
B005UKJX4E|5.0|Mythological.  A visual tour-de-force. A very moving film.  Powerful imagery married with a great narrative. This film works on several levels: emotional, intellectual and spiritual.  It is so layered that one has to view it more than once in order to experience each plane. The film's narrative is deceptively simple:  a disillusioned man (Sean Penn) looks back at his childhood after learning of his brother's death.  The acting  by Brad Pitt as the stern father and Jessica Chastain as the spirit-filled mother is flawless.  The child actors are perfect.  The movie requires careful attention and open-mindedness; it is by no means a conventional \\"Hollywood\\" film.  Yet, the serious filmgoer will not be disappointed.  A must-see for any student of film.  Malick's films focus on finding the spiritual in everything (nature, people and events) and Tree of Life is the epitome of this artistic vision.  Be prepared to be amazed.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|I'm an attorney and all the entrepreneurs and wannabe entrepreneurs I know have read this book so I wanted to see what the fuss was all about it.<br /><br />Gladwell is a good writer, he must have put in his 10,000 hours, and the book is engaging and informative, a fast read.<br /><br />I won't repeat what everyone else has said in this forum, but I will say that I found numerous statements of his book to cast too wide a swath to be accurate and in doing so, are also racist, specifically against Asians and frankly I am tired of mass media being sanguine about casting racist statements against Asians but being super sensitive, almost obsequious, when it comes to statements made about other races.<br /><br />For example, the title of one of his chapters is \\"Rice Paddies and Math Tests\\" and explores and attempts to validate the racist theory that \\"Asians are good at math\\" [I'm Asian, I'm smart but I've never been good at math] and how an alleged economy based on rice [Gladwell mixes agrarian South Chinese culture with all other Asian cultures which is racist - nobody tells an Argentinian that his cultural background is the same as a Mexican farmer's and vice-versa] created an entire army of Asians who feel compelled to work like racehorses and which explains why they prospered in low-tier service industries in the United States.  RACIST and just stupid.<br /><br />How would African Americans feel if he wrote a chapter entitled \\"Picking Cotton and Basketball\\"?  About how African Americans have never really excelled in academics but rather in physically based activities like sports and blue-collar trades because that's how the \\"African American culture\\" developed?  That sounds dumb and racist, right?  That's exactly how his chapter on \\"Asians\\" is set up.  Which is too bad, his disingenuousness in this chapter really undercut the validity of the rest of his book and he does have some other, thoughtful points.  I was excited about reading some of his other books but thereare so many really good, inspirational books out there, I will not be wasting my time any more on Gladwell.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Another Summer of 2013 anthem.  Reminds me of the Bee Gees.  But it's a catchy and great song to boogie with.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Lost one I bought straight from Apple so I looked to amazon to find a replacement. I was not disappointed. It has worked fine with no problems.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally we get the complete version of this game.  It seems Android users always get the shaft. Just when part 2 is going to release on Apple devices, we get the update for this one that includes free play and zen garden. Still an awesome game though!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So much fun and very addictive (in a good way) I'm a game hopper so for this game to hold my attention for more than a day means ITS TOTALLY AWEESOOMEE! I would recommend this game to everyone. :-)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My daughter shared this app with me and I have since found that I'm totally addicted to it! I find that I'm checking daily to see if you've added more levels yet!!
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Every cd they put out is great. This one is even better! From start to finish I really enjoyed it.
0316247545|5.0|The book itself was fantastic, I couldn't have asked for anything better! I was a tad bit displeased with how the shipping was handled but that was poor design on fedex's part so I didn't take a star off for it. The book clearly lays out each episode's synopsis and key message, along with the lyrics from the show and the characters. I'm so glad I purchased it and I know it'll make anyone who receives it very happy.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|First of all, I really thoroughly enjoy all these movies! They have from great acting, characters and lots of imagination for all ages to love! These movies will be loved by many generations to come. There is no more convenient, affordable way to own all these films and enjoy them repeatedly. If you are a Harry Potter fan, this is a must own!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Love this movie ! Read all the books and had to have the movie in my collection. Would recommend to anyone who is into this series.
B009R659L8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The last one of Clark's that I read I couldn't get caught up in, but I thought this one was great.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book sure does keep you interested.  I also feel like I am getting my moneys worth since it is such a long book.
B0017SV1OI|5.0|The original tracks are everything I remember from my long lost vinyl copy.<br />The bonus tracks are an interesting insight into the process of creating the final results.
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|I actually loved this movie. Just watched it a second time and liked it even more on the additional viewing.<br /><br />The concept is great. Saoirse Ronan is superb as the lead. William Hurt is perfect in his role. I think they did about as good as they could have with this story in a 2 hour movie.<br /><br />Could it have been better? I think so. Most of the flaws that detracted from slightly from my enjoyment all came back to some things being rushed to fit the run time. Given the disappointing box office results, probably good that it wasn't split into two films, as we may never have seen the second half, but it would have been better if they could have made wise use of an additional 30 minutes to develop the key relationships.<br /><br />It's sort of sad that over the top Twilight hate seems to have had blowback on this film's reception, being based on a book by the same author. This may not be a great film, but it's certainly much better than the critics would imply. Certainly not a film for the lowest common denominator.
B000NJVWTQ|4.0|Most of the original tracks are great, though I found &#34;Sagrida Familia&#34; too long and not up to Alan Parsons usual quality. The bonus tracks are an interesting insight into the creative process but seem out of place if you're listening to the album as a whole.
B000001FOS|5.0|Yngwie & Joe Lynn Turner  have composed a great album.<br />The music, lyrics, hooks are superb. This is an album chicks will love as well.<br />There are many iconic songs. Buy it.
B00005OMTT|3.0|This cd has a lot of great music on it. Have always loved this group. Very awesome and very cool.
081541028X|4.0|I heard this was the best book written on the subject of an astronaut going to space. I still have a small glimmer of hope that one day I'll become an astronaut too, and wanted to get a sense of the process to get there. I read this book while in the process of applying to a 1-month medical school rotation at JSC-NASA. Some things discussed in the book have changed, but a lot hasn't. Reading about Michael Collins journey was fascinating and many of the problems he mentions are continuing to be addressed today.<br />I'll probably read it again and take notes next time.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|I love the movie and the music. All the songs are upbeat and very entertaining. Really an awesome cd. I loved it.
B00A81MV3U|2.0|Just because you use the same title and some of the same names for the characters does not mean you should be allowed to say it is based off of the novel. It is almost the opposite. *spoiler alert* For starters the dad was the opposite in the book. He was not actively trying to bond with his son at all. The whole basis of the lead characters illness was changed and many more differences. The worst being the ending. I just can't say how terrible the ending was compared to the book. I can't say if this was a good movie if you didn't read the book first, but if you did you will be sorely disappointed. The acting was good that's why 2 stars
B007HO392S|4.0|I really like Carrie Underwood. Her Blown Away cd has a lot of awesome songs on it. It is very entertaining to listen to.
0062255657|5.0|No he's not an old friend.  I've never even met the author, but when reading this book I felt like I was hearing the mellifluous voice once again from an old acquaintance.  His writing put me in the dream-state, stalling all further disbelief about his magical world.<br /><br />There were times I felt the author pulled back, because I wanted to go further into those fantastic places that we only caught glimpses of.  I suppose that is the beauty of its power to go brief into the unbelievable and then come back to reality, leaving me aching to go back and see once again what that strangeness was in more detail.<br /><br />Of course there are several unanswered questions.  Nevertheless, I didn't feel short-changed from the open-endedness of the book after finishing it.  A short and sweet novel packed with volumes of wonder.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Here is a simple review: Enjoyable love story wrapped in a science fiction storyline with characters you come to love.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I think that this series [castle] is the best that tv has to offer,all the shows are great. keep going
B005LAIIHG|3.0|I had read the book, &#34;Life of Pi&#34;  and was anxious to see how the movie could depict the scenes in the<br />lifeboat but I was rather disappointed ...  the movie dragged on too long and, in my opinion,<br />didn't have much of a plot.  The photography was beautiful, though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Captivating! I finished this book in 2 days time because I couldn't put it down! Great read. Highly recommend this book.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie...... So glad I bought it!!!! I cant wait to watch it again as well as share it with my family & friends.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this book.  I have read a majority of the Lee Child &#34;Reacher&#34; books, but this one provided information from the author about the character and the reasoning.  I loved it and am ordering Reacher book 2.  Then I should be all caught up.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|first off, I didn't see this in theaters.  In fact, I rented it thru netflix & thought it was just cute at first.  Then it started showing on HBO & I decided to watch it again, then again, then again, then again.  I fell in love with this movie.  I'm singing Cups all the time.  Fat Amy is probably my favorite character in this.  Rumor Willis is amazing in this movie. Of course I love Anna Kendrick & I couldn't help but wonder if she really is anything like her Character Beca?  I tell everyone that if they haven't watched this yet, watch it.  Its hilarious.
B0033PQUL2|5.0|Yes, it's a \\"chick flik\\", but it's much more than that. In the 30's and 40's, Hollywood's \\"Women's Picture's\\" reigned supreme with Stars like Bette Davis, Ida Lupino, Olivia DeHavilland and, of course, Joan Crawford. MILDRED PIERCE is quite possibly the best women's picture of al time.<br /><br />This was the first picture that Joan Crawford made after she signed with Warner Brothers after being forced out of M.G.M. Joan actually went on suspension while she waited for the \\"right script\\" and in this case, her instincts were right and the script well worth waiting for.<br /><br />Mildred Pierce, while in the planning stages was said to have been offered to Ann Sheridan, Ida Lupino and even Bette Davis. Michael Curtiz's first choice for this role was Barbara Stanwyck, who would have been great, but when Joan saw the script, she gladly auditioned for Mildred and was awarded the part.<br /><br />The real triumph of Mildred Pierce was the script. The original James M. Cain novel was interesting in its own way but unexciting. The was no murder in the novel. That's right! The device of adding the murder and telling the story in flashbacks is unique to this picture. It added a sense of intrigue and suspense which the novel and the pointless remake did not share.<br /><br />At the center of all this is Joan Crawford in the title role and, if you've never seen Joan at the top of her form, this is the one film you should see.<br /><br />The supporting cast is superb: Ann Blythe; Eve Arden; Jack Carson; Zachary Scott; JoAnn Marlow; Lee Patrick and Butterfly McQueen all sparkle with Blythe and Arden receiving Oscar nods for their work.<br /><br />Directed in a slick Film Noir Style by Michael Curtiz (Casablanca).<br /><br />The disc also contains the best biography of Joan Crawford that has ever been made making this DVD a must have for your home library.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It keeps me entertained. It's not the best game out there but it keeps my attention. It's easy compared to son  other room escape games.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but was kind of suprised and disappointed by one of the things revealed at the end. Ill definitely read the rest of the trilogy though
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Courageous is the best of the Sherwood Pictures films to date - easy to see that the acting has improved and the budget has increased from the days of Flywheel and Facing the Giants.  A great overall family movie with laughter, tears, and love.  All families (but especially Dads) should watch this film!
B00BP0O5TG|5.0|This book was excellent. It shows the history and struggles of apartheid through the eyes of Nelson Mandela. Although the book is long I read it in less than a week, because I could not put it down. It was so interesting and makes me have even more respect for Nelson Mandela and other South African freedom fighters.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this was an amazing game. it kept you focused and on ur toes. really into the game. a must get
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|I really enjoy this album, and I believe that Salvant is what every person thinks of when they picture a jazz singer; an old soul. She brings with her an old world feel along with a sailing youth. She's charming, and her voice is definitely something worth celebrating. Watch out for her, and enjoy this album with your morning coffee, on your drive to work, or with a glass of wine after dinner. Delightful whenever and wherever it is heard.
B00ABKGG0C|2.0|The book Blood Song started out good with some original ideas and an imaginative new fantasy world with just a touch of magic or actions that couldn't be explained.  By the second half of the book it appeared Ryan was making up new themes as he went along and lost cohesiveness to the story line.  I have my doubts about this continuing as a viable series.
B007STBUIW|5.0|If you like this movie you will love the blu-ray version.  The pictures are so real.  The special features are fun to see.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Great love story about two lovers who would do anything for one another. Unexpedicated ending! Another great book by Nicholas Sparks!
B00932A4XE|5.0|Tells stories of 4 couples who are at 4 different situation in life in terms of expectation of a new born. On one side a couple who accidentally get pregnant and on the other side a couple who can't get pregnant.  Also beautifully covers how each couple goes through very different issues through pregnancy.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use Evernote almost everyday! I love to write so it's great for brain storming, quick notes and jotting down my ideas. It's awesome!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I have been a great fan of  Rowlings' Harry Potter series and gave this book a lot of latitude as a result. The book has well developed characters and fluidity, but is so dark. I did not expect to find negativity in all the characters. I left reading sessions with a sense of unease and discord. I have no desire to read another book like this. I gave it 2 stars on account of being well written, but give the story itself 1/2 star. Had this been written by another author, I wouldn't have continued to read it
B0064X7FVE|1.0|We used to LOVE this app until they changed it and added the sponsors. We don't minds ads, but this app is confusing and horrible and ANNOYING now. We deleted it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent series. Can't wait for season 4.  Nothing not to love about the show. Very interesting characters. Stunning costume and set.
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|Definitely worth a listen or two or three. Bastille has become one of my favorite new artists so I splurged and bought the album. Did not disappoint..
B0084AXZK0|4.0|This book yields more thoughts and descriptions than plot. I often found myself bored with it rather than entertained<br /> Adieu!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is fun. It has amazing visual effects so i feels like you are taking care of a real horse! I recommend for all ages.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It was so sad I cried the last ten percent of my book such a good love story I enjoyed
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|i love it its got loads of dinos and even sea creatures whats next?<br />it even has characters from the movies.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I have listened to it over and over. Just can't get enough of it. Totally love it! Alicia never disappoints.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Picked this up because my husband wanted to see it, and it was a great price- thanks amazon. Movie was super good too, great acting, awesome plot, we loved watching it.
0877180121|5.0|This book has been good for my first time piano learner.  Great way to introduce the piano, learning the notes and reading music for my grand daughter who is not quite ready to take lessons from a regular piano teacher.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Good game. Asking for DNA/ evolve help sucks! You add friends for help yet you can't ask for there help or go to there park and help them!! Other than that I enjoy it...
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the one app I got for my grandkids.  They have it on their iPod and their moms phone and kindle fire.  I got it for my kindle fire so they could each play by themselves or together online.  Haven't tried it myself but I know that it is the one game that all 3 age groups (12, 9 and 7) can all play and enjoy playing.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|This looked like an awesome product, until actually putting it to use. Great features like VLAN, Multi-SSID, dual-band (selectable, not concurrent), SSH, SNMP, 3T3R, etc..<br /><br />The problem is, throughout ~2 years of use, this device locks up constantly, daily even. The syslog reports multiple times a day that the radio beacon is having to be reset, the VAP is down and up, and stuck. It's by no means reliable and goes down often for 10+ minutes at a time, until it just stops working entirely until a hard reboot.<br /><br />Along with that, the speed on it is incapable of getting anything close to what 802.11N is capable of, let alone this device being able to handle anything close to it's rated 300 Mbps spec.<br /><br />I've done all versions of the firmware since it's release to date, and never seen any improvement to it at all. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. There are definitely better products that are less expensive that outperform this and are more reliable.
B0062OCNAI|2.0|Well it was an interesting concept, but the inclusion of mundane details of family life to the point of smothering &#34;I remembered tying the shoelaces on his tiny sneakers and admiring the peach fuzz on his silky upper lip as he said &#34;oh, mummy, I want a peanut butter sandwich now.&#34; Ummm...okay, but chapter after chapter trying to maintain interest in a rather vague story line told insistently second person, filled with &#34;I had the candles for the birthday cake in my flowered bag, the one you and Jenny made fun of me carrying because it was so motherly, and then Addie ran up in his little soccer uniform and said 'Oh mummy, can I go up and have my birthday cake now,' and my heart swelled at what a strong young man he had become, so noble and gallant.&#34; not exact quotes here but the general idea. Bottom line is I thought this was a murder mystery, and it turned into a hokey family drama with spiritual overtones. About a quarter way thru I skipped to the end for the punch line, I couldn't take it anymore.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|Kevin Spacey is at his sardonic best in this show about the ins and outs of politics. Brilliantly shot and wonderfully acted by great cast that includes Robin Wright, Kate Mara and the wonderful, under used, Constance Zimmer, this show had me transfixed every episode. Are there lulls? Yes, but they are few and far between . I highly recommend this show for anyone who likes a great political story.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really liked this movie; it was well done.  I question the ending.  I don't think that part followed the book
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|A beautiful, and well done pastiche that is the set up for the Baum books and the MGM movie... James Franco does well as the ersatz wizard, but his emotional range is limited. The woman in the movie, Rachel Weisz, Mila Kunis, and Michelle Williams - seem to be having a great time under Sam Rami's direction. The story is a little understated for my tastes, but I generally had fun, even though I was always a couple steps ahead of the script.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My family has fun with this game. We challenge each other to different levels to see who can complete them the fastest. Each leval has clues that you must find in order to proceed. It makes you use your brain but is very entertaining. Beware: you'll be addicted.
B0025KW29U|5.0|Loved it when it was on line. Loved it as a DVD and loved it enough to get it when I bought a Blue Ray player... It is fun, intelligent, viewing with an ironic ending that has caused other people I know to tear up... Some of the songs are a little simple, but they all move the story forward, and are very clever.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|No sure why the format was changed. it was so good the way it was. I cant get the animation now. I am so disappointed and delited it. sorry. it was so good and helpful before all the changes.
B008CRC506|4.0|This is a show I didn't want to like. It's supposed to be all about what happens behind the scenes of a musical trying to make it to Broadway, which I do like and find interesting, but it devolved into a little more than a soap opera with music. That being said, I was totally engrossed by the characters and the actors who played them. The majority of musical songs, and numbers were fun and entertaining and at the end of the day I pretty much got sucked in... And yes I will be getting season two...
B0013UIUBC|5.0|I watched this movie once with my two children and it was great!  we watched it again when my husband wanted to see it and we had a good time watching it as a family.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I'm very biased, and wish it was still on the air. Unfortunately Joss took his time to really get to the meat of this series and was really getting very interesting in the last few episodes. The characters were engaging from the get go, and that's what kept me coming back to the show initially. You don't need to watch the series to get to the movie, &#34;Serenity&#34;, but it doesn't hurt.
B004X75RK4|5.0|I definitely loved this movie and I recommend to those who are super busy and have a stressful job, it will make you forget all the stress for a couple of hours. Great sense of humor and the acting is very well done. PS. watch this movie, you won't regret it.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I loved this book. It was so surprising. You read it and you can't stop. The best part about it is that it's free. I can't believe a book this good would be free. It relates.to my other favorite book,the humming room.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Ka Boom a Ka brah! Brah! Brah! Brah!<br />Also I like it. It is frustratingly fun.<br />Annoying amount of notetakeing.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I have to say how shocked I was to have enjoyed this as much as I did. the 2 lead actors were a lot of fun and totally great. I was hoping for good and I got much better than that.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I really like this app because it's an easy way to access my twitter account. the only problem I have with it is that sometimes it lags so much, it force closes the entire app. otherwise, I really like it.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|It's great loved it from beginning to end. Once you start you can't stop reading it. This is a must read book!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Harvey Specter and Mike Ross are about as awesome as a duo as Batman and Robin. This series is incredible.
B008YW5RH2|2.0|Only get the first round free so disappointed on the other side game is pretty fun really wish you could move your player it is not really a free app don't get if you're looking for a free app
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderfully done. Now thats quality entertainment. Even my teenage daughter love Downton Abbey. Violet is our favorite. Good job, please make more like it.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|The app is very good everything i needed for an alarm clock but I also have the lookout app to and it said that this app has malware and it would try to get my email and passwords. How it would have gotten them I have absolutely no clue but other than that it would have gotten a five star rating from me and my experience with the app.
8804572450|5.0|Too bad it is not translated in English. I've been reading it in German and was hoping I could find an  English translation. It is is a beautiful love story.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a good game I like to play it .. is fun and challenging and I like games like that
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Gave to my brother as a gift because it's his favorite movie. He's happy.  It is as described and expected.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is really awesome. It is way better than any other horse apps. The only bad thing about it is you have to wait for energy
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Awesome series so far wish there were more of them I love shows like these and look for them to watch.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|Up until the ending, I liked this movie.  Loved the tiger, loved the story.  Didn't like the ending at all.  It was a huge investment to get involved with this story and the ending (to me) mitigated the entire story.  Sorry.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Been on this diet for four weeks.  It's different, it's doable. The book describes the science behind it, what to expect and offers recipes.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have loved every Sookie Stackhouse book that I have read.  I have also read every other Charlaine Harris book that I could get my hands on.  I felt a bit like this book was forced out and the story just a bit flat. Maybe the publisher shouldn't have pushed so hard on this last one?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my daughter loves playing this app and it runs great. I recommend it! great for kids and adults. thanks. that's all.
B00008G7UF|5.0|The plot in this movie was certainly easy to follow, with sometimes hilarious and slapstick scenes that can never be forgotten. A most memorable film to watch again and again.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series. Can't get enough of Gideon & Eva and there turmoil entwined in their lives. They story is getting better and better. Although I was not expecting this kind of cliffhanger but it will keep me hanging on for the next book. It pulled me in from the first words and kept me wanting more right to the end of this book anyway. I love Sylvia Day and her writing. I had heard a few people complain about this not being the end but it has not changed my feeling about this series. I loved it from the beginning and will wait patiently till the end, hopefully not too long though!

0913866156|5.0|I love this deck. It just has a certain energy about it that makes it powerful. I think its the imagery. Its beautiful and evocative, opening doors in the psyche. Very archetypal. Love it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everything streamed smoothly - I could watch DA again and again. A little hard to find and realize which version is what, because there is an HD, British, etc... but this version seemed fine.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but I had to for this one! This game is by far my favorite! You make a disease and try to take over the world, who wouldn't love that! And to everyone who says you have to pay extra to unlock all the disease types, you don't! Just beat all the levels on the hardest difficulty!
B00AVFO41K|4.0|I almost didn't download this on its day as the FAoTD due to the hypercritical reviews, but I'm glad I just went ahead and did it (even if the app isn't something I think I'll use immediately,  if it's something I think I'll find useful or fun in the future, I \\"purchase\\" it and just skip the install, so I'll have it for later).<br /><br />This game is similar to one of my recent Google Play free favorites, 7x7, which requires you get a minimum four like-colored squares lined up for elimination on a 7 x 7 grid. That game's a bit easier, but its graphics are nowhere near as high quality as those here, nor does 7x7 offer the special feature pieces that this game does. Here, you get directional arrow exploding pieces that will eliminate all of the other pieces in the row, going the direction of the arrows. There are also bomb pieces that'll take out pieces in a radius around it. If you line it up so one of the special pieces takes out a portion of the rown that contains another special piece, that other piece will go off, too, poasibly eliminating many more pieces in just one move. And rainbow pieces will substitute any color you need.<br /><br />Long story short, this game is well worth checking out. It is NOT easy, and I haven't won a game yet (not sure you can, as it seems to be an endless puzzle), but I definitely enjoy the gameplay!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Noticed my kindle fiire only had 705mb out of5.36gb free, couldn't figure out what was going on, used Clean Master and cleaned up 2.4gb of junk files and old apk's, amazed at how it sped things up, really easy to use.
1439175640|4.0|I think that this is a good recipe book to add to a kitchen library.  It has a great deal of good ideas for baking, and the recipes are easy to make.
B000JNOO7I|5.0|this movie is a must see for re-animator fans, not as good as the other two but still worth watching
B00B2V66VS|5.0|pantasty wonderful amaizing beutiful the best applicition  in all the world  i so love it i play this game evrey day in my mum phone
0307476464|5.0|It was my first Murakami book. I decided to read it after the amazon.com reviews & wanted to read an International Best Seller Novel for a change after reading so many reference books and biographies since 2007. I was addicted to the novel when I reached page 50. Afterwards, the story was so fluent, characters well established and dialogues were very intriguing and sometimes shocking that the book became a page turner quickly and kept the adrenalin till the last page. I was very impressed with Mr. Murakami for his imagination and success for adding different elements to his story including the culture of Japan. You can find suspense, love, erotism, drama, philosophy and a little bit of surreal imagination in this story. I must also give credit to Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel for their wonderful translation. I bought the hard-cover edition which made it easier to read and now looks very good on the library shelf. For anyone who is after a powerful page-turner novel, I would strongly recommend this book. The two main characters of the novel, Aomame and Tengo develop perfect profiles during the story and makes you wonder all the time for the next pages. Although it is a bit long, it worths giving a try.
B00846REIS|3.0|It was not what I was expecting after read 50 shades, but it was ok. I hope the next 2 books are better
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|Good, clean lyrics; real nice harmonies; another trip down memory lane. after playing cd I was happy with my purchase.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|All the die hard evil dead fans seem to hatr this movie.  Why??? Its a perfect remake. And i hate remakes. But original evil dead was boring.  Evil dead 2was was ok. Army of darkness was boring and nerdy amd just plain bad! This uses all practical effects too. Horroe movies never do that these days. This movie is so damn gory! It kicks ass. Buy it on dvd. U wont be disappointed
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I was looking for something new as I was addicted to spider solitaire. This is perfect. Very fun and addicting.
8499182984|5.0|it is a good book for the spanish speakers and those who are learning the language, it is highly recomended
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved Katniss' will to save the ones she loves and the suprising events that happen through out the book. I especially loved Cinna's dress design when it turned into a mockingjay.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son loves this game so much. the levels are challenging and keep him busy. The only issue would be that it loads slowly on my kindle fire.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|The long conflict between Christians and Moslems reached the historical heights at the battles in the Holy City of Jerusalem during the Crusades. Great cast, good performance, and a renown director in Ridley Scott who is famous for directing battle films, scored a great success in this one. The Blu-ray restoration was excellent and it's really worthwhile to regain if you like the ancient epic battle movies.
B0000028WD|5.0|The album was incredible! Bob Dylan will always be the best musician of our time. I knew even before listening that I would love it.
044024367X|4.0|After reading the overwhelmingly negative feedback on this book, I skipped it and went ahead with the next few. Now that I'm waiting on Never Go Back in September, I took a chance and read Nothing to Lose. I must admit, I enjoyed this one, more than some of his previous efforts. Is there political commentary, yes. Is it in keeping with Reacher's philosophy, I think so. Is there an almost obligatory romantic involvement, of course. But it had a nice conflicting twist. I felt the pieces of investigative work fell together nicely in the end. Some assumptions were made by Reacher, as usual, but they worked out in the end.<br /><br />One complaint I have is the rather rushed ending. The fallout from the climax received very little follow up. But all-in-all, a good read in my opinion.
B008XG1X18|5.0|absolutely love Pinterest! You can pretty much find anything on here.  My favorites<br />are the recipes, diy and gardening. always something new.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|After watching this movie I really fell in love with Katy Perry.  She was so real and didn't feel anything was staged.
B001NPDCFQ|4.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray version of Meet Me in St. Louis sparkles.  The film has been remastered, and it looks pristine.  The colors are rich, and there is a good level of detail.  There is some film grain present, but it does not call attention to itself.  The sound did not hold up so well, however.  It sounds like an old movie.  This is probably not the fault of the transfer, however, but rather the source material.  Yet it did not bother me overly much.  I watched it with the expectation that it was an old movie.  Someone expecting modern sound quality might feel let down.  So I give this movie five stars for video and three stars for audio--which averages out to four stars.  Highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved the show, but it would not play on my iPad, only on my pc.  I downloaded the app, but it still would not play.  I could only watch it from my regular computer.  The quality was good and choosing episodes was easy.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was an amazing story that will bring tears to your eyes. The book really sucks you in emotionally which makes the story that much better. They only qualm I had is the research I did on these events after I finished the book didn't match up with all the details from the story. I am not sure if the author decided to sensationalize the story (i.e 150-200 enemy fighters, when in the Navy report Luttrell mentions 20-30) but I feel like the conflicting points take away from the SEALs acts of valor. 4 guys fighting off 10 guys would be a feat, no need to exaggerate these claims, either way all of these guys were true heroes.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Thought this game might be fun when I had down time but it turns out to be very addictive. Once I run out of coins I can just put it down and come back later and have my coins refilled. Some times you just need a mindless game!
B006GECE9Y|4.0|A good browser and works for most sites without hassle.  adding bookmarks is easily done, but no RSS feeds, or I haven't got them to install properly.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|I actually bought this book through Amazon for my kindle.  Working in a career with a team environment, it really helped me not only understand my strengths and what I bring to the table but also recognizing other colleague's strengths.  This is an easy and great read that provides great information to be applied for both business and personal.
0062238868|5.0|Chris' descriptions of every day life during BUD-S and further training are reminders from days long gone.  Despite the Press hype, Chris doesn't break any secrets, but gives glimpses into everyday SEAL life, and allows his wife's take on things as well.  RIP Chris, you were slain by a fellow Vet, but you were doing what you loved at the time- helping fellow Vets.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Did they really have to kill him?  I love this series. If you do, read ken follett's fall of giants.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|The movie was a gift for a special girl. She loves it and the DVD is in great condition. Shipping was fast and easy. I'm very satisfied.
B000XCHQFC|1.0|this was the first time i purchased a video on amazon and the experience was very poor. my family was not able to actually watch the movie that i paid for. we kept getting a 1003 error saying i could not watch on more than one device. I logged out of amazon on both of my macbook's and tried logging back in again, would not play on either device. now this morning i am getting a 6013 error? just play the movie already, i hope this doesn't happen to anyone else.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I have been a Kanye fan since the beginning. But you people are ridiculous.  This cd is awful.  How many times did he reference sleeping with someones wife? Kanye has always been an average to below average rapper who's hard work at lyrics and soulful production carried him. Remove the hard work and soulful production and what do you get? This turd in a jewel case of an album. I was furious when I heard it. Completely wasted blood on the leaves. After reading the track list I was sure this was going to be a game changing work.  Wrong! Words can't express how bad this is.<br /><br /> If you're into garbage music like Tyler the creator and kid cudi this crapfest is right up your alley.<br /><br /> You would think after Kendrick Lamar dropped GKMC all these artist would be on notice but the 3 major releases, jay-z/jcole/kanye have been major let downs.

B00CU8OVIM|2.0|I'll give you brief synopsis of this album.<br /><br />Each verse goes exactly as follows,<br />At first I was overlooked now everyone wants me, keep your head up woman, random semi deep thought, woman really want me.<br />Repeat over whatever mediocre beat you can find and you have Born Sinner.<br /><br />This isn't classic or even good, barely tolerable. His next album should be called \\"Really Let Nas Down This Time\\"
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was very fun and entertaining. It didn't have enough levels though. I was done in 2 hours. If you like a challenge but not too hard of one you will enjoy this game

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've you want a quick tear jerker with an amazing story line this is a perfect book for you. I found myself wanting to come home and read non-stop which is what happened. But needless to say a wonderful job by John Green, this story of his makes me want to touch people's lives that have less than I.

0316017930|2.0|Oh, dear.  I hate to say it, but this book was a stinker.  There's some interesting information about what it takes to achieve proficiency in a particular endeavor and what it takes to achieve excellence in your field (not necessarily what you'd think), but the generalizations here, especially the ones relating to race and region, are uncomforable at best and offensive at worst.  Knowledgeable reviewers on amazon have already responded to the cultural assumptions regarding rice growing societies and the descriptions of airline safety.  But the chapter that appalled me with its assumptions was the one on the \\"culture of honor\\" in the American south.  Gladwell cites a study done at the University of Michigan as evidence that this attitude still prevails in young men from our southern states (never mind that the study is from the 1990's and not exactly up to date).  The study involves insults dealt to young men from northern states and to young men from southern states and supposedly shows the southern young men were more offended by the insults.  Therefore, Gladwell claims, they have been inculcated by the \\"culture of honor.\\"  Ok, well, this whole \\"study\\" sounds asinine to me.  Yet, if we're really going to call something like this a \\"study\\" of human behavior, shouldn't it be noted that the \\"northern\\" young men were in their home state or at least their home region (hello?  Michigan?) and the \\"southern\\" young men were not?  Something tells me that being far from home and being singled out for unprovoked insults might be more stressful and therefore draw a stronger reaction from a subject than receiving an unprovoked insult in one's home environment where one is more attuned to cultural cues.  I'm certainly open to the possibility that Gladwell did not represent the study faithfully.  Perhaps the University of Michigan professors were far more careful than the book makes them sound; perhaps they made allowances for this.  But, if they did, Gladwell does not say so.<br /><br />Yet, having said all that, I have to say the book ends very well.  Some reviewers have assumed that the outlier featured in the final chapter is Gladwell himself.  I think the chapter is about Gladwell's mother.  It is a heartbreaking story about slavery's legacy and racism, and Gladwell is breathtakingly honest about the painful realities involved.  This chapter will break your heart; but, his mother's honesty and grace, fueled by her faith, allow her to perceive her own racism even when she is herself a victim of racism.  Her son learns from her ability to forgive herself and others who sought to persecute her, and that is a story from which we can all learn.  I didn't like the book, but I loved the last chapter./><br />Yet, having said all that, I have to say the book ends very well.

This chapter will break your heart; but, his mother's honesty and grace, fueled by her faith, allow her to perceive her own racism even when she is herself a victim of racism.  Her son learns from her ability to forgive herself and others who sought to persecute her, and that is a story from which we can all learn.  I didn't like the book, but I loved the last chapter.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I had it for a day and then it wouldn't load up again if anyone else had the same problem what did you do or recommend for me to do?
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|It was a great movie.  The story line was good<br />and the acting was also good. I really enjoyed it
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This movie doesn't quite get a 5 star rating but I try to reserve 5 stars for movies that blow me away, and there were scenes and moments in this film where I was moved and blown away.  Bradley Cooper (is gorgeous!!)was good in this...he was on point when portraying the manic stage of bi-polar disorder and he needs more roles like this to show what a gifted actor he is.  Chris Tucker was also good.  Now as the parents...Jacki Weaver was great but Deniro??  He was fantastic and proved once again why he is one of the best actors in film. This movie though really belongs to Jennifer Lawrence.  I know she is young but she must be an old soul to be able to portray the emotions required of her.  Her face reflects so much emotion even when no words are spoken.  I look forward to seeing her career progress!
0062238868|4.0|Good book. Gave as gift.  Was enjoyed by family member. Chris Kyle explained his plan to help veterans. Sad he was murdered by one he was trying to help.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Just as described by the seller, I bought for My daughters birthday and she loved it! And of coarse now she wants every different style lol! Would definitely recommend this for any hello kitty fans!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton Abbey is definitely one of televisions vest kept secrets. The production of the show is excellent and the cast does not great job I'm being able to transport you back to that period in time.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I really liked that the batteries can so soon after my ordering.  They were in the best of shape and I was really  pleased at the price, because the ones I priced at the grocery store were $5.95 each.  These were the same one and the price was much less and I think I really got a bargin. Thanks.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Another Excellent book by Lee Childs! There's always something unexpected in his books. Jack Reacher is  outstanding in his deductive reasoning in solving problems that were overlooked by law enforcement officers.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|When I was looking for a new series to read I wasn't sure I would like this but I'm so happy I gave it a try.....  Couldn't put it down!
B009WUBERW|1.0|I would not waste my time watching this movie unless you just want to see your old favorites back in the movies again. I liked the first one but this was horrible.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I liked this book almost as much as &#34;The Kite Runner,&#34; and much better than &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns.&#34;  I especially liked how all the stories were interconnected.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|It's a rare man that doesn't think Mad Max is a cinematic classic, my husband being no exception. Nice to have them all in one blu ray.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Ordering and receiving was smooth. Mom got it for Mother's day and it was perfect. Now I think I need to order it.
3836538725|5.0|Sebastiao Salgado's work in Genesis is incredibly lovely.  The print quality is great.  This book is a must for collector's of great photography.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought I wouldn't like it but I loved it much better than the movie can't wait to read the next one
B004FD9C20|5.0|The book is great and I like that the tracks are short so if you want to go back, it's easy to fine. I do wish there was a chapter/CD track guide though. That would help a lot in going back to review or finding your place again if the CD gets taken out of the player by someone! :)
B000O8OTNC|1.0|I followed the instructions and tried several different types of knives.  Never could get any to sharpen at all.  Not happy with this product.

B005LVR6ZA|3.0|Experts, espers, anti-espers, this world is like a dark xmen era, there is also half dead people in cold packs, and you can talk with them, and none of this is a spoiler!
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|cute game keeps  the grand kids intertained for an hour.  Even the youngest  could follow the directions on the cards  while learning to read and colors . Nice to have something they are into and can learn from it.  Angry birds is  todays kids type of game  better than having them on a handheld  or computer gadget this one they can talk and discuss thier moves and happenings.
B006S009IY|5.0|I'm going to buy this soon. Great story, acting, and you Will cry. The youngest child does an incredible job.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Not only does it have great graphics, but it allows for hours of fun, interactive gameplay for kids, teens and adults alike!
B006LSZECO|2.0|would not read another book by this author. did not care for the main characters nor the theme.reading it was disappointing
B002E66C6E|5.0|I was in the mood to watch a good Navy flick. This is a fictional liberty based on actual events during WWII.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I can't get enough of this series! It definitely introduces some new perspectives, and makes me start loving the unloveable! GRRM can't get these written fast enough for me.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|This movie was much too long and very confusing!!!!!!  I do not recommend this movie it was just very slow!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun. I recommend playing this if you like temple run. I enjoy it and can't stop playing.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|Takes you along like you are apart of rock history during an era that can't be duplicated.<br />Extra addition expands on classic.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is so good... definitely going to play every day for the rest of my life<br />- BRONIES<br />Woo woo woo
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Best review and analysis of Bob's impact up to the flower generation. Historical footage and current day comments by participants<br />are great,
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Found it to be an okay learning tool for understanding how plants grow in the sea but thought it was a bit boring
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  Just enough of a challenge to keep my interest.  Wish there were more levels! I can't wait for next addition.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|it gets boring after a while and u have to pay real money to get more keys it is stupid tht is my thought
B0066WJLU6|5.0|does a lot more<br />is a great flashlight<br />used it when I was camping when I walk the dog at night & it is bright!
B0000248VB|5.0|I've been a fan of Henry Mancini's music for some 50 years, and I never get tired of hearing it.<br />Since my original Mancini music was on records, it was time to get it on CD.  I'm enjoying it<br />frequently.
B007O4XX9K|3.0|I wanted it for the title track, but the rest of the selections are just mediocre album filler ... completely forgettable.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this to carry muy Vixen telecope and even if I had to buy another tripod than the Mini Porta, because the last one is too big, I can easily and securely take my telescope anywhere I want. That is what I wanted!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful acting by all the actors - even the very minor characters are professional actors.  Beautiful interior shots.  Compelling story.
143911000X|4.0|I liked it because its kinda true.<br /><br />I disliked it because it was a little expensive for a used copy, $6-$7, plus, shipping?<br /><br />I would recommend finding a cheaper copy for a pretty cheap book, if you know what I'm saying.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My son started playing this game at school. And he loves it, and I catch myself looking over his shoulder to his how his park is coming along.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Very good book but not his best.  Did not like the ending but could see it coming.  Look forward to reading more of his books.
B007SGM084|5.0|My wifes' co-worker recommended this book to her! She never put it down! She even said she wish she could read it at work!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Lovely music to wake up by!  Very convenient and easy on the eyes.  I could have purchased an alarm clock but I think they may now be extinct!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|My son is in love with this game! He is 6 years old, we limit his time playing this game because it addicting!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game to play on the tablet. Might share this w/ the kids or keep it to myself. LOL Thank you for the free app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it because its like a mix of telmple run but its from dipicable me. I hope everyone has fun with this app too!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I am really new at playing Angry Birds.  It is fun and will download the others when I can master this.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the way this show has develped each character and the story line keeps you engaged throughout.  Great show!
B009G41CG2|4.0|I wish it would give you hints when you need it.  But I love playing Mahjong Tiles. Good exercise for the brain.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This a unique little game to pass the time.  I enjoy getting out of the rooms and it is not a game that drives a person crazy to solve. I am waiting anxiously for more of the promised rooms.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love playing hidden objects games and this is fun and some of the answers are hidden right in front of you and you can't see them.  I am still new at this game but I really like it.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|Wonderful, riveting nuclear war devastation movie.  It is very realistic as to what to expect if this scourge ever came true.
0452289963|5.0|It is one of those books that I will return to again and again. It literally has changed my life. I highly recommend it.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This book will stay with you long after you finish it.  It is a true story about a SEAL mission that went terribly wrong.  It is also an amazing story about the supermen that we Americans have in our midst.  The story becomes very human when Marcus is taken in and protected by brave Afghan villagers.  It makes you think about the cultural differences in people but also their finest qualities.  A good read!
B006GWO5NE|3.0|The on/off switch on the Kindle itself is defective.  The unit could not be charged properly with the original cord.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I was very hesitant to watch this show while it was airing or on netflix for years. Not because I heard anything bad about it, i just wasn't into it. I finally started watching it about a month ago and was I surprised! It is hilarious! Probably one of my favorite sitcoms ever. I am also a fan of Seinfeld and Scrubs, my kind of humor. I would definitely recommend this show, really to anyone,
B00957T6X6|5.0|As a fan of the show, I became obsessed with this fantasy world, and I see why. The books are excellently constructed and present themes not present in other fantasy books, which I appreciate.
B000FA675C|5.0|What can you say about this awesome story? Much better than the movie, but you should see the movie too!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I swear there is no comparison to temple run. besides running you can play mini games inside of the dash it is so fun would totally recommend it to people who the love the saying: &quot;it is so fluffy&quot;
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Not a badd app. I am not sorry that I downloaded it.  Not the best, but for a free app, I would recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is easy and challenging at the same time. Makes down time go by when there is nothing else to do.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Okay app. I am not sorry that I downloaded it.  Not the best, but for a free app, I would recommend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book.  Already purchased it.  This is the first book I have gotten through in a very long time.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|it's a good app. I am not sorry that I downloaded it.  Not the best, but for a free app, I would recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|HOLY CRAP THIS GAME IS AWESOME THANK YOU MOJANG I LOVE U SO MUCH!<br />SO WORTH THE $7.00 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO YOU
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|Okay app. I am not sorry that I downloaded it.  Not the best, but for a free app, I would recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it I totally recommend it. Minion rush is the best game ever . Down load it today. Despicable me was also a great movie
B003O86FMW|3.0|Took a while to get into this book but . Once it  Going it was very good about half way through.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Wow. Well done. This is really really fun. It may not be GTA, but its just like it. Well done
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|Easy and fun to use.  Being able to turn off the screen and set a sleep timer plus turn off the device or use other apps make this app superior to those on my ipad.  And you can turnn off the device yet still have a pleasant wake alarm.
B0091REZMW|4.0|A fun and entertaining finding the object game.  Can cost many $$$ if you want to progress at a decent rate.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I definitely like the current. App version I have. Display screens are well organised. Someone commented n the new update to the app with not a good rating so now I am reluctant to update . Is there any way to revert back to a previous revision?
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Versions of Mahjong solitaire are a dime a dozen on any platform. However, this is an excellent one. It has practically everything, multiple board shapes, multiple tile styles, etc. and it plays nearly flawlessly. The only thing missing is the actual game of Mahjong. You see, that game is a two or more player game very similar to poker or cards. It's played with the same tiles. While it is bad form in an Amazon review to provide external links I do recommend you use a search engine to find out more if you are interested.<br /><br />Now, this fact does not detract from the game and that is why I gave it 5 stars. I just thought you might be interested in that minor fact if you didn't know it already. :)<br /><br />This is a great version of the game Mahjong Solitaire but it is not the actual game of Mahjong (which is actually a four player game that happens to be played with the same tiles).
B000M341QE|5.0|Astonishing; Shocking Buy it for your library !  Jack Nicolson Mark Walberg,Martiin Sheen, Alec Baldwin Put is together on Corruption on the east coast ! were Wap and Mic Clash !
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I wish I had read Ms. Reichs books before I became hooked on the BONES T.V. series. The characters are not what I expected although I did enjoy reading this story. The setting is different, the characters are different, and the style of forensic sleuthing is also different. Temperance Brennan is just as stubborn and intelligent, though, and the story is compelling as it takes the reader on a journey from Quebec City to the far reaches of the Canadian wilderness. I will read other Kathy Reichs novels.
B00080ZG10|5.0|This Young Man may be a Punk in his Political View's but hey he is an American All Opinions matter. excellent portrayal of  the Genius of H.H .detail was excellent plan crashes were awesome Only In America folks buy it !
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Played eighteen games thus far,  Some are excellent while others are less interesting.  Major problem is limited time to meet required targeted score to proceed to next game.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Pozirk Games has developed this game with the PLAYER IN MIND.  It has 3 Impressive TILE STYLES, 16 Beautiful Backgrounds and 42 Unique Puzzle Configurations to choose from.  The Controls and game play work flawlessly.  You can Undo last move and use HINTS any time.  It also shows Time used and number of Moves Left.  If no moves left, you can Reshuffle and continue.  The Graphics are very Sharp, Colorful and Vibrant.  Music is Soft and Soothing.  All Sound Effects are very good too.<br /><br />The 3 Unique Tile Styles are very Pleasant, Colorful and add nice Variety to the game.  The 42 Puzzle configurations are Interesting and vary the difficulty of game well.  HD Graphics are Vibrant and Fun.<br /><br />Overall, an Enjoyable experience with lots of choices to Customize your games.  Replay Value is high with so much to chosse from that it makes it more Engaging and Satisfying.  Very USER FRIENDLY.  Works Flawlessly, creates Fun Challenges and No Intrusions or Annoyances.  I Highly Recommend it.
B000FC10WU|4.0|Kept you guessing until the end.  Interesting read all the way through,  didn't get bored with it at all .
0740797719|5.0|Wanting this book for a long time. Nice and clear so far. Looking forward to finish the reading. feel excreting
B002VPE1WK|2.0|The backpack is OK if you just want to carry the camera and lenses and a few accessories. But I was hoping I could use it for other things as well.
B00AYQNOU8|2.0|Unless you like this sort of thing it's kinda boring. Couldn't even finish watching it for no other reason than I was bored.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome. its cute and fun and addictive. I absolutely love this game because I love the minions so much. sweetness its great!!!! :)
B004NS710C|5.0|This movie is one of the best I've ever seen.  It kept me on the edge of my seat and talking to the TV the whole time.  When it was over, I watched it all over again.  I've only done that with one other movie in my live.  The writing was excellent!!!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My 3 year old has really enjoyed playing this app.  Simple enough for him to do all the collecting and find new things to plant in his reef.  My only complaint is that the wireless connection needs to be on the entire time and that leads him to the option of buying extras so I need to watch him even closer than usual.  Beautiful graphics and music compared with other apps we play together.
B007JMW46U|5.0|I read this before letting my son read these talks. It was fantastic and I can't wait for him to read them.
B00D6MJOAQ|4.0|I can already tell this is one of those albums that i learn to appreciate the more i listen to it. I'm a huge Boards of Canada fan and i'm enjoying this new release.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Ocean at the End of the Lane is Neil Gaiman ad his best. I got the sense there was a whole new world of rules and mythos behind the events of the book. Unfortunately none of the myth was explored at all and I feel like this book could be a prequel to a much larger, more epic series of books. Actually, with as enthralled as I was with Ocean at the End, I can only hope this is true.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Using Dropbox between work and home has been a lifesaver but I just discovered that I could use it on my phone to to save my photos! What?! Amazing! I never have to worry about losing photos again if my phone goes nutso or someone &#34;accidentally&#34; deletes all my photos (yes, that has happened)!
B00846REIS|4.0|It reminded me a little of fifth shades of gray.  So you know when you start these kind of books you can't put them down.  It was a fast read and perfect for the summer time by the pool.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Finally! Magic the gathering Fun on the go! Heck yeah! Haven't tried multi player yet but hope it works and plays well!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft pocket edition is a awesome game but creative mode is stupid if you buy don't play creative mode play survival mode it is better
B009E3EXMU|5.0|After some less than stellar performances as &#34;Led Zeppelin&#34; since John Bonham's death in 1980 (Live Aid, Atlantic Records 40 year anniversary, etc), they nailed this one. Sure, it's a mature Zeppelin doing tunes in lower keys, in different renditions, and without Bonzo behind the drums but Jason Bonham put on an inspired performance and Page, Plant, and Jones all really shined on this night. Highly recommend!
0307943259|5.0|Enjoyed the newest by John Grisham. He is at his best in his genre, & it is compulsive, easy reading!
B000HAB4KS|1.0|Too violent.  Not enough plot and too much gimmicky special effects.  Looked like a video game. Sound quality terrible. Dialogue was very low and then when volume turned up to hear it then the soundtrack blasted you.  Would never recommend.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Love this new game! Hours of interactive fun!! There is a reason it was voted &#34;Game of the Year&#34;! Also, check out Amazon's versions of the game. Something that keeps going that long, must have something to offer!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's a lot more entertaining version of temple run, it's really addicting and fun for all ages.
1609611543|2.0|But boring.  It is Atkins redux with too much technical jargon.  I had to skim a significant portion of the book just to say awake.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|This is a great movie.  I have the first Sherlock Holmes staring Robert Downey Jr. and needed to get the second.  It arrived relatively soon after ordering and the price was reasonable.  Truly a god purchase for me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a wonderful way to exercise your brain and sharpen your detective skills.  We highly recommend this game if you like to do puzzles and figure things out.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Love Indiana Jones and his adventures!<br />Even better on Blu Ray!<br />Only wish Crystal Skull was never made...<br />Here's hoping Disney does something great to contribute to this franchise.
0399255370|5.0|I got this not really knowing what to expect.  I am so pleasantly surprised!  It's written as letter from the crayons to their owner, a little boy named Duncan.  And each color has their own complaint, rave or issue.  It's a great way to help show empathy and theyre talking crayons!  And it's funny!  AND the illustrations are fantastic!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I am a lifelong reader of comic books and have been a viewer of every incarnation of Superman starting with George Reeves in the original TV show.  So how does MAN OF STEEL stack up when compared to its predecessors?<br /><br />Pretty damn good, I would say, mainly because:<br /><br />Plot tension: is Kal-El/Clark Kent the last son of Krypton or a freak marooned among an alien race?  This one of many questions driving David Goyer's script which tackles what it means to be an outsider and whether one's destiny is predetermined or a result of free will. This gives Superman some much needed internal conflict and a theme to drive the story.<br /><br />A great Superman: Henry Cavill has the looks and the physique to pull it off, but he has the talent to convey Kal-El/Clark Kent's inner battles.  Cavill has to do a lot of acting without dialogue and express a broad range of emotions with his eyes and body language.  He is far from the cipher some critics have charged him with being.  He doesn't make you forget Christopher Reeve, but perfectly compliments the earlier performance.<br /><br />A great villain:  Michael Shannon is a terrific General Zod, and that's not taking anything away from Terrance Stamp's version of the character.  But MAN OF STEEL manages to explain and deepen his motivation, giving his animus toward Kal-El a real edge.  All super hero movies need a great bad guy to go up against, and MAN OF STEEL really delivers in this department.<br /><br />Great fathers:  Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner as Jor-El and Jonathan Kent respectively.  Crowe's Jor-El sees his son as a future champion, the embodiment of all the greatness of Krypton; while Costner's Jonathan Kent raises Clark to hide his powers from a public that fears and hates what it does not understand and can't control.  And there is one hot Momma here as well as Diane Lane makes Martha Kent sexy for the fist time in a Superman movie.  (I'm not forgetting Annette O'Toole on Smallville, but that was TV.)<br /><br />Great battles: the final throw down between Superman and Zod makes skyscrapers crumble and the earth itself shake.  This is exactly the kind of fight we've waited years to see.  And I have no problem with the way the battle is resolved, something many Superman fans did not like.<br /><br />Great tweaks in the origin story: I'm not going to detail them here, but let's just say they work.  I especially like how Crowe's Jor-El was given a lot more screen time and the demise of Costner's character was changed so that it resonated more.  Lot's of die hard fans most emphatically did not like these changes, and some of them I would agree with, like when Jonathan Kent implies that Clark should have let his friends drown rather than risk revealing his powers.  Then there are those who just can't buy into \\"comic book logic,\\" and for them there is no help.<br /><br />Amy Adams is a fine actress, and she does give Lois Lane the proper amount of pushiness, but I just don't like the way the script has her simply slip onto the long buried Kryptonian ship and discover Superman's origin and identity.  At the same time I like the way the story does right by some minor characters like Pete Ross.  But where is Jimmy Olson?  I do miss some of the humor Richard Donner brought to his 1978 movie; everyone in MAN OF STEEL is very serious and very earnest.<br /><br />Nevertheless, MAN OF STEEL is a great reboot or re-imagining (whatever) for one of the 20th Century pop culture's greatest icons, making him relevant again in the 21st.  Siegal and Shuster would be proud of what producer Christopher Nolan, screenwriter David Goyer, and Director Zack Synder have done with their creation.  And I can't wait to see what they don next with Superman; maybe take on Brainiac? Or Lex Luthor.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|When this book came out. I was overwhelmed with people telling me to read this  set. Now I know what all the fess is about and am hooked. I can't wait to see what happens. This is a Amazing book and a very fast read.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I loved the actors in the movie and was excited to see a prelude to Knocked up.  I had a hard time finishing this movie even though, at times there were funny parts.  I would not watch this again in my lifetime.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so cool it is totally freaken awesome.I love this app and I love horses get this app it is a must have
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Actually better than the first.  The books in the series do not stand on their own, you really need to read them all in sequence.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|Haven't got very far on this, but so far it is very good.  Definitely following the series at this point.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this app soooo much i highley recomend this but the thing that i would change is that u dont have to have wifi
B00BQHA06A|5.0|Love this band, love this disc.  The metal is really there on several of the songs.  Very glad I got it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great.  Did not expect it to solve the problem but it worked just fine.  Person I spoke to on the phone was very helpful.
0007466064|5.0|The whole series has been intriguing, and this does not disappoint.  Leaves you wanting more.  Have to wait for it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|you can use this tool to sharpen darn near anything.. there are SO many uses for this tool! knives of all shapes and sizes, scissors, razors, and any number of other sharp tools.. LOVE IT!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent. Want to see more.superb acting. Characters blended with each other and all very stately. Buildings and landscape add the right touch.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love to play this game except I wish we could get credits more often. But I'm so addicted to this game!!!
0062255657|5.0|It is a great read. It is about the everyday life and perhaps less epic compared to some other Gaiman novels. In the beginning I feared whether it would just be a longer short story that might lack complex plot lines and character development of novels. (see, I am not really a short story reader) Pointless fear. The taste the book left behind is somewhere between Neverwhere and the Graveyard Book with a bit of a American Gods touch. The end of the book makes you feel that something is unfinished. It is as if there is so much more to the story but we are just not granted the permission to learn. it befits the atmosphere and the plot of the novel but nevertheless makes me a little bit frustrated.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Overall it was a very good and a great way to end the Wheel of Time.  I would have to say it is one of the best books in the set.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like how this book keeps you guessing. It doesn't just keep on about the sex, but also keeps you guessing about what will happen next. I am looking forward to reading the next book.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is great if you really want to have a great marriage or relationship.  The ideas are practical and can be used easily, if you are willing to try,
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have so much fun playing the game I don't have to be bored all day long with my cuzin
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|Always wanted to pick up music by the kings of leon. but had never done it, this came out , nad boom got it all at once... great buy for me.... thanks.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I haven't seen the movie, yet, but this book is so amazing I need to see it. It all seems like this could happen to our world, and really makes you think about which character you would relate to or what you would do in these situations.
B0052AJ1OO|5.0|Love the Chemical Brothers. Saw this movied for the first time, and it was amazing.... the music really helped top off the movie... great buy...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good<br />Good good good good books books books books blood from the imagine that to them and I was Jim he has been restored to the imagine that
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|One of the best shows available today. Has everything you could possibly want really other than fast cars or helicopters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think its a cool game you should yet it :D yeah i need to put this lol lol lol lol

B000NY12LO|5.0|The first book I've read from Jodi and it's one of the best books I've read. I will remember this book forever.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator app that I have found so far. The interface is easy to use and even easier to see. If you are looking for a calculator for your Kindle, this one will not disappoint.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Really like this game ..has a bit of a challenge..My only problem is sometimes the bubbles just go on there own...must be my tablet is touchy sometimes.  On the whole I really like it.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|If it is free,why am I Out of money for cards???  I will not buy any,FREE is. FREE.lo<br /><br />Also, why are there  bingos when I haven't even started yet.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|The book was not at all what I expected although I am not sure what that was. The author does a good job of devoting each chapter to a individual character while at the same time maintaining the flow of the overall story. In my opinion that is what makes the book enjoyable.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game wish it was longer.  The puzzles make you think and look for the next piece.  Loved solving the puzzles. Hours of fun but it does need to be longer.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun and challenging game. you have to solve puzzles and search the whole room for clues to escape.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Love The Story!! Great addition to my Brandi Carlile collection, I'm going backwards I know, but this is my new old favorite.  Glad to be reconnected.
B000FBJF3M|3.0|a good book to ready when you are going to Pompeii, which I did. I read it on the plane and the train. It gave me a good insight into the eruption and the world around it at the time.
B004JK61K0|4.0|I tried this to replace the email reader that came with my kindle fire hd. It works  much better and is a lot easier to use. Set up was fast and easy but I did have to adjust the settings for the send mail. Highly recommend. Can't beat the price.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Here is a racial civil rights era film that puts the struggle in a fully human context, showing both sides.  Funny, real, warm, and sad.  And great performances.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is or probably was for the kids........at first,but not now. Great game! Minions are cool as beck...graphics are perfect and it can be addictive. I love it.
B002ZG976U|4.0|I learned much more about burlesque than I had known.  The plot, though a bit weak, was fun to follow. Christina was fabulous!  So was Stanley Tucci.  And Cher was Cher, enjoyable and overdone as always.
B004R1Q296|5.0|Barbara Tuchman has done a remarkable job of describing the life of both the rich and poor in 14th century Britain and Europe.  The intrigues between the kings, religious leaders (especially the Popes) and the knights are elegantly described in detail.  I recommend this book highly for all history buffs.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|This book relates with interesting history, statistics and arguments why certain civilizations developed and why some remained primitive.  Hint: It has nothing to do with race.  Telling you any more would spoil the book.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I love this movie, need I say more?!Unfortunately I don't have a blu ray player, but that's OK the DVD is good enough for me!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Very catchy tunes and melodies.  Great synth. There's a reason why this band is so popular right now in the Alt Rock market.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Don't care for the lay out,  Should be more like the game on my comp.  ect. ect. ect. ect. ect.
B005K17RU0|5.0|As a weather geek, this app satisfies most of my needs, from temp updates displayed nicely on my Galaxy 3 to radar.  I recently spent a month in Europe and I found this app invaluable when deciding whether I needed my umbrella or not.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Just a good movie and Tom Cruise....hilarious!<br />Definitely would recommend! Good for movie night w/friends and for a good laugh!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book has now hooked me on the series.  Even though it's written for an 8th grader, it's easy to follow, and connects with the kid in me.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I have never been able to access my email account through my kindle tried sveral times to get e mail but never could
B004LUS390|3.0|This is an awesome app, but useless for my needs<br /> if the saved and exported files are no bigger<br /> than a postage stamp!<br /><br />Anyone know how to save your art & export a file<br />larger than 74.00KB -<br /><br />At this size you get very tiny stamp size pictures.<br />I need more like 8x10 pintables(at least)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is really cool and it is for all ages and you can get it on your iPhone and really cool!!!!!!!!!
1442337966|5.0|perfect from the first to the last minute.<br />easy to understand, very interesting; I highly recommend it.<br />final note: 10/10
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|Intriguing, funny, smart... What is not to love about this. Sure there are a few episodes here and there that are a little slow, but the others are wonderful!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I am in love with Seth MacFarlane, really that is enough to be said. I would definitely watch anything he has a part in. If you love his work you will love this movie
0761169253|5.0|I really love this book. It has given me new ways to think/work. Purchase for yourself and one for a friend. Highly recommend!
038533348X|4.0|I received this book as a gift and if I wouldn't have, I don't know if I would have read it. Very glad I did.<br />It's about a guy doing research about the day the first atomic bomb was dropped. Through this research he meets many interesting (if not a little weird) people. Travels to San Lorenzo where he finds a culture with odd beliefs that seem to work for them. All this time looking out for Ice 9.. an invention that turns all water/moisture into ice. Which in the wrong hands can cause an ice age/apocalypse.<br />A subtle satire on religion, society, humanity, etc.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I first read about this book in  my local newspaper.  I realize that this type of diet is not for everyone, but it definitely works for me.  Not only have I lost 20 pounds in the 3 months since I began following the recommendations, I also look at food completely differently.  I eat more veggies and fruits, and I'm satisfied with much less to eat.  What I really love is how flexible this program is.  I never feel deprived, can eat what I want, and I am still losing weight.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great app i love i recommend it you set time alarms music and brightness i love it tots use it =)
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Almost as addicting as angry birds. You have to think outside the box sometimes for solutions. Hours and hours and hours of fun
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is a great game for all ages (as long as you can read), because it takes some of the true elements from the t.v. show and puts a new plot around  whole game I really liked it.
B009G78EE2|2.0|I think this CD has a few good songs on it, but the more I saw him interviewed and actually listened to the words of his songs, the more I got a feeling that his heart does not match what is coming out of his mouth most of the time. When I saw him interviewed on the Colbert report, I just got a bad feeling about him, like he is just trying to make money and does not actually care about his \\"deep\\" social messages that he regurgitates to the public. After a few listens, it became clear that his album is riddled with conflicting messages as well. One song will be about respecting women and people, and the next will be all about bitches and hoes. One song he will talk about cleaning up his life and the next he will be all about drinking in excess and partying until the break of dawn. I think either him or Ryan Lewis decided that the social message thing might not work and decided to add some typical rap songs just to be sure he sold some albums. This completely contradicts his supposed hate of major record labels by doing exactly what he preaches against. Very nice Macklemore. Very genuine.  If you like one or two songs, I recommend just listening to them on Youtube or only buying the songs, but save your money on the whole album. He seems to be a confused guy and just as phony as the next major rapper.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|It is really good movie and very exciting and very active movie.  It is something I am interesting to watch.  Bruce Willis is an excellent actor.
006198969X|5.0|Lauren Conrad Style\\" is such a refreshing book I could not put it down. It is a timeless books that has common sense advice for all women no matter what your age is because Lauren's enthusiasm for fashion and beauty is contagious. This is such an uplifting book and diversion. Her personal style does justice to her natural beauty and her book is inspiring.
1846551455|5.0|I am an avid fan of Jo Nesbo and his Harry Hole series.  I was thrilled when I discovered that the first Harry Hole novel had been translated into English.  It  still has not been published in the U.S., but Amazon offers the UK publication, so I ordered it. It arrived without any problems. I would recommend The Bat to anyone who loves the series and who has always been curious about Harry Hole's beginnings and what has molded him into the tortured, but brilliant, detective Nesbo portrays in his later novels.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I like the game but finding neighbours is hard<br /><br />I like the theme of the game and the animations. If I could find people to play with would make game a five
B0002NRQTS|5.0|What can I say, this is a phenomenal Rush album.  If you don't own this album then by all means you should.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|I hadn't watched this movie in over 20 years, and when I came across it while browsing through Amazon's dvd offering, I thought it was worth the small investment. I have always liked the theme in this movie, where the main character has become enamored with, and over romanticizes, a group of people he knows little about (the Italian cycling team). It offers a great lesson regarding the potential for disappointment when we chose to view things through rose-coloured glasses. A very enjoyable movie, and the picture and sound quality were quite good.
B00000295Y|4.0|Great, classic Cypress Hill.  Nice CD when just cruising around town.  Now I have the whole collection.  Get this album.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|I had heard references to Das Boot for many, many years but had never quite gotten around to watching it. Now that I have seen it, It is one of those films which I would describe as truly memorable. Great characters, riveting story, and you can't help but imagine what it would have felt like to be confined to a submarine during the war.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I waited to replace my google reader and Feedly does so much more.Great to use on my kindle fire or web browser.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not super easy but not super hard either. I love the problem solving aspect of it and can't wait for more levels!
1439190275|5.0|Awesome book, great diet and super information to maintaining a healthy life style. I recommend that everyone read this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is a high quality production with an excellent line of actors and a very intriguing and captivating story. I can't wait for the new season to start.
B00A77II0U|4.0|The developers did a really good job of creating a creepy atmosphere.  An enjoyable game play experience.  Worth a try sometime.
B00992CF6W|3.0|there's not every thing on pocket edition as there is on the computer virson it called full virsion people at least put some wolves in it!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It's amazing. I loved it so much that I would give it  infinity stars! Like if you type car you'll get a car. But you can't type characters like Mario,Sonic,or Bowser. It's still worth 0.99&cent;.
B00B69UQJY|3.0|Depeche Mode is my favorite Band in the whole world, so they can practically do no wrong.<br /><br />This album is not one of their best. There are maybe 4 songs that are good; 1 or 2 really great. But overall, it doesn't measure up to albums like Some Great Reward, Music for the Masses or even Violator. Having said this, I applaud the band for always trying new sounds and new music.<br /><br />If you are a Depeche Mode Fan, it's a must have. If you are not that familiar with their work, I wouldn't suggest starting with this CD.
0425263924|5.0|I loved getting deeper into Gideon and Eva's world.... I'm upset that Slyvia ended on such a cliffhanger, my heart can't take the wait!!! However I am glad to know the story is not over.
B004V45YBG|4.0|Which of two stuffed parrots is the one Flaubert wrote about? Who cares, you might be forgiven for thinking, but in the hands of Julian Barnes, the quest of a Flaubert fan, a retired doctor,to discover the genuine article becomes a compelling series of linked essays that leads the reader on find out more than he/she ever thought they wanted to know about 19th century France and its bourgoisie, as well as Gustav Flaubert, and the 21st century protagonist himself. Writing effortlessly and flawlessly, Barnes guides us through the Normandy countryside, back and forth on the Channel ferry, and through Flaubert's love life as revealed in his novels and through his letters. Give this one a go when you want a soothing read and a relief from airport bookshop fodder.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|love the goonies and wish it had a part 2.when i was a kid i could not get enough of this movie.HEY YOU GUYS !!!!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I have enjoyed this game immensely and it has allowed me personally  to RELAX AND UNWIND  from a hectic  schedule of past year or so.  I did feel a little guilty for having some  me  time. Then  I relaxed and dug in. Lol  No room for worries  when you connect with this hand .eye  match game.<br />Highly  recommend  it.  :)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I never thought that I would like a summer reading book so much!<br />  This book is amazingly written, with an incredibly touching plot. The symbolically embedded story was amazing. Being in middle school myself, it was fun to relate to Auggie, Jack, and Summer's emotion's myself. It was one of the first books I've read that has moved me emotionally, made me laugh, and taught me a lesson. I will remember this read for a long time and I recommend it to all people!
B0081336FO|5.0|Great team up and they nailed the essence of Sherlock. A must watch for all. A very suspenseful show every episode is like a movie.
B000SW4DLM|5.0|Classic scifi, widely considered one of the best films in its genre. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go watch it right now.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I'm kind of mad it took me this long to read it!! It keeps you wanting more . I read the whole book in less than a day!!!
0425263908|1.0|This is simply a book written by an author wanting to jump on the Fifty Shades bandwagon with no original characters or plot. It read more like a roundtable discussion of Fifty with changes to appeal to a wider audience (and thus, sell more books):<br />  *Didn't believe Ana could fit into a rich and famous lifestyle, because she was just a simple, \\"normal\\" person? Well, let's just make her rich, but still lead a \\"normal\\" life, with a \\"normal\\" job like Ana.<br />  *Didn't like Christopher's sterile, modern apartment? Well, let's just put more comforting/cozy furnishings in it.<br />  *Were you a little skeeved by the \\"fun room\\"? Well let's just get rid of that, and just lightly dabble in BDSM.<br />  *Are you gay/bi and felt left out? Well, let's throw in a little \\"fun\\" for you, too.<br />  *Didn't like the jealousy issues concerning Anna's boss? Well, let's just make the boss gay. Problem solved.<br /><br />This book had shallow, unlikeable characters, no plot, and absolutely no ending enticing me to grab the next book. I found myself bored and annoyed by the sex scenes, because there was no true love tying these two characters together. The only thing they shared in common were sexual abuse in their past. And, unbelievably, used sex as their therapy and each other as their crutch.<br /><br />Finally, in order to sell more books, just divide one large book into several books, like this one did. There was no ending to speak of, nothing resolved, so interesting plot twists, nothing. Waste of time!
B005544TRQ|4.0|No nudity, no real violence and I still continued watching both seasons in 2 weeks time. Some parts didn't appeal to me but most was great.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Great app for reading items posted on line - can forward to a printer to print out if need for reference.
B009NX61JY|5.0|A sweet, funny romance,Jeff Bridges is adorable..........well worth it -splurge and watch in HD though...it's too 'fuzzy' otherwise.<br />Lauren Bacall is still a stunning woman...
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Great App for my Amazon Kindle items and if I want to order something while out and about thus not forgetting what I needed
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Couldn't ask for anything better,it's like all of the old 7th guest and 11th hour games..without the walking around aimlessly
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Sara is a very good performer and has great musical talents. She should go far in the entertainment industry.  I liked the CD.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I never knew this ever happened in the US...very good book...heartwarming and tragic at the same time...very hard to put down
0393345408|5.0|India and most of Asia have loads of foreign investment. Russia is a difficult place to invest. Africa has little foreign investment, and Mexico has the worst. No wonder.<br /><br />Mexico's education levels are crap, while Cuba's literacy rate is 100%. In Mexico City, millionaires don't flaunt their money for fear of being killed for it, but they still need platoons of bodyguards. If you want to know why, look at the Middle East for comparison. In violence-plagued Arab countries, doctors are rarely the target of assasination, and that's probably because the people aren't stupid enough to \\"kill the cure.\\" But in Mexico, doctors get kidnapped and held for ransom, killed in the street for their money, etc. In the Middle East, doctors and scientists are held in high esteem, but in Latin America, nobody gives a shit. I bet you a criminal with a newborn will say \\"let's kidnap that pediatrician, hold him for ransom, and kill him when the money doesn't show up to show we mean business.\\" He could be the only pediatrician for miles around.<br /><br />Now let's look at Africa. The infrastructure is crap, roads are winding, railways are few, and the governments are corrupt. Getting a business license in Senegal can take forever unless you know whom to bribe. If you want to start a business there, everything has to be imported. I had a friend who lived in Dakar, and he said it's NOT cheap to live there. Food is very expensive in the cities, and no wonder; if you're a farmer, the only way to get to the city is by road. The few men who own motor vehicles will squeeze you for all they can. A head of brocolli costs $12 USD! Ethiopia, a country full of cheap labor, has only one railroad (coast to capital) and who even knows if there are any trains?
B000069CWE|5.0|Look, I love Hybrid Theory as much as the next Linkin Park fan, but some of the songs were certainly lacking. It was their debut album, after all. But some of the songs on Reanimation just made the original song even better, also. Some of my favorite songs from Hybrid Theory are now ousted by the remixes on Reanimation, just because of their sheer awesomeness. I've been listening to this album for years, and most times I can't go back to the original songs because they just don't do it for me anymore.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I don't usually read Stephen King since the only time I tried to read one, I gave up because of the language(too many &#34;f&#34; words).  My daughter-in-law suggested this one and promised it wasn't just the &#34;f&#34; word.  She was right.  The story really engaged me and the language in the book wasn't there just to fill space.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I was so happy and so ready for the new Daft Punk album. I know a lot of people are disappointed with it, but I don't mind the change of pace. It's Daft Punk - they were innovative before, they still will be now. I welcome anything they come up with, and I will love it forever :)
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book gives the back story on the Master Chief, the Spartan II program, Captain Keyes, and more. See Spartan 117's story as he is conscripted as a six year old boy, and transformed into a war machine. See the Spartans in their glory days.
0062059963|4.0|Now, this book is sort of a Hunger Games-hybrid: It's a contest where the girls have to &#34;battle&#34; for the heart of a guy. Maybe not very Hunger-Games-y, but trust me, it kind of is.<br /><br />Being the second in the series, the reader already pretty much knows where this is going. I was a bit wary - the author had pretty much made all the plot moves she could in the *first* book, so I wondered what exactly she would scheme up for this one. And she had a few surprising moments for sure. The only improvement on this book was we didn't have to go through all the overdone hubbub of pretending we don't know she's gonna get into the Selection.<br /><br />There are some plot points that are rather predictable in this one, as in the first one, but as I said before, there were quite a number of surprises too. If you read the first book, then just go on and buy this one already. You know you wanna know what happens next.<br /><br />ONLY (real) PROBLEM: The next (and last) book doesn't come out until next June. (Yes I mean 2014.) Soooo... don't be expecting any answers any time soon.
B000002JSJ|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT CD - THIS IS A VERY  UNDERRATED SET OF TUNES FROM ZEP. THIS IS THEIR VERSION OF HEAVY METAL.
0061726834|3.0|This storyline had promise. The idea that this country could take such a sharp turn, lock down its borders and not let anyone in or *OUT*, and then diagnose love as the greatest evil, the reason there is bad in the world... That's what made me interested in the book in the first place. I'm a huge fan of dystopian and apocalyptic works, like the Uglies series.<br /><br />However... this book was entirely all too predictable.<br /><br />If you *have* read the Uglies series, then you'll be able to figure out this plot relatively quickly. It doesn't follow Uglies' plotline exactly, so don't get me wrong about that. It's just the premise of it. And the story... you knew exactly where it was going after you'd read the first chapter or two.<br /><br />And that just made it no fun to read. I won't post any spoilers in here, but every single \\"plot twist\\" can be seen coming a thousand miles away. I just have to ask myself, did the author even try? I literally predicted every event that happened in the book. And who ever wants to actually be right with what they think is gonna happen? It's so boring!<br /><br />The book ended on a predictable cliffhanger, so you have to read the second book to find out what happens next. Lucky me I already have that book, or else I probably wouldn't bother trying to finish the series.<br /><br />It wasn't a bad book, it just didn't pull me in the way I wanted it to. The main character is way too much like Bella Swan, just so willing to think little about herself, and will fall in love with the first boy who looks her way. She finds her strength in this boy and would rather die without him. And that's just pathetic. Girls are never going to be strong if they keep reading these books where women only identify themselves by the men they are with.
B000001DQI|5.0|THIS IS A CLASSIC ELTON JOHN CD FROM 1973 - IF YOU OWNED THE LP - YOU MUST GET THIS CD
159514188X|5.0|1. The physical writing of the story is clever and brilliantly composed. It portrays the two main characters in a relatable and realistic way, that allows you to really sympathize with the characters and understand everything they experience, even though they're fictional characters.<br />2. The character development - The characters, while at first they appear to be predictable, they are actually very honest, and not necessarily unique, but they're like a person you would know - they are realistic. You're not led through the story thinking there's gonna be a happy ending - it's realistic. We all know happy endings don't actually happen.<br />3. The storyline - While it shouldn't be unique, it kind of is. You know from the start exactly how it's going to end, but you're hooked from the moment you start reading it anyway. It goes through emotions and experiences that everyone is high school goes through and experiences, maybe not as dramatic or drastic. But they're all feelings you relate to, about bullying, about feeling left out, feeling like you don't belong, feeling like everything you do is a lie, and is fake. And how everything is interconnected, how the most insignificant things you say and do can completely affect someone else.<br /><br />So in short, it is a beautiful novel, and gives you a lot to think about how you treat those around you, and just how much the way other people have treated you have affected you, the things you do, and the way you feel, the way your life's turned out, because of the choices you've made, and how the choices of the people around you have affected you.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie was a complete disappointment. Not to mention the sound quality was low and spotty. Also we could not view the movie in full screen, this could have been Amazon Video. We turned the movie off after 30 minutes of dull! Don't waste your money.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Love the concept. Completely different than any other strategy game I have played before. Only thing keeping it from being a 5 star game is the drag and place feature was seriously flawed and made the  game more frustrating than it should be. Placement of objects need not be so sensitive when hovering over the area it needs to go!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie is so awesome! A typical Terrantino thriller, leaves you cringing, crying, laughing and hanging in the edge if your seat! Jaime Foxx and Dicaprio really bring it with their acting. Only complaint was overuse of the \\"N\\" word.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very good game . Fun and funny. Beware it can be addictive, not that that is a bad thing.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, the author has a great writing style. I'm looking forward to the next one in 2014.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was not able to lay this down.  I just had to finish it.  Love the both Dean and Sky (Hope).
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Can't say enough about this! Love it! Can get free books from amazon.com and check out ebooks from my local library! Easy to use and carry around!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|pretty good game. a little glitchy, but worth it. controls take a bit to get used to. does take a LOT of memory though .
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I don't know how I'll be able to wait another 2 + years for book 6.  This book leaves you with so many cliff hangers!
B00DU74U74|4.0|It's definitely a Stephenie Meyer movie, but the premise of the story is great. I love sci-fi and the lead actress is a great job portraying the alien and human in one body. It's not Twilight. It stands on its own, but the ending makes you wonder if there will be more. :)
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book isn't quite as eventful as book 3, but this book was equally as great. I absolutely loved it!

This calendar is a functional improvement over traditional wall calendars. Columnar data for multiple household members is just so awesome. Stickers for common events. Every page has something fun on it. And if you're a Dad, you'll like it, too. My husband can't do without it now, even with digital calendars.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome visuals and ambiance make this a very enjoyable puzzle game. Very well designed mechanics help to immerse you as you try to figure out what your next step should be. The wonderful animations were a treat and fitting reward for unlocking the various parts of the puzzle. The best compliment I can give is also this games one weakness, it was too short. I would have gladly played for many more hours if there were more content.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|Of course it is the greatest hits and has all the best songs. The new tunes are awesome as well.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman' imagination knows no bounds and his skill is impressive. He is a master of his genre. This was a superb book and I enjoyed every minute of it.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|One thing I found out about playing it, is how little I know about chess and how much more studying I have to do to become a beginner. Once I get better at it, then I imagine I will enjoy it more.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina is hilarious, relatable and just plain awesome :) I love her honesty and straightforwardness, it's so refreshing and fun.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game for working the thinking part of the brain...Lol I was unsure at first I would like it cause I downloaded a game similar to this but it was all bad....
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|You will love this album if you love Boz Scaggs music. You will not be disappointed. Buy it, and enjoy!

B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I've been a long time Blake fan.  This CD is definately from the heart.<br />There are some tear jerker songs there. But great background music for<br />a special dinner with that someone special
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn was a remarkable storyteller, and the plots he devised were as gripping as anything Clancy or Ludlum ever produced. But the editing mistakes in this book were unforgivable. &#34;All the more easier...&#34; Really?<br /><br />It's a well-known fact that Flynn was severely dyslexic, and thus given to misspellings and typographical errors. He once told an interviewer that he had a very difficult time reading his own books, and under no circumstances could read excerpts at public appearances. Hence, he NEEDED a good editor, but his publishers occasionally failed him on that count. They certainly did so here, and it's too bad, because Flynn deserved a much better send-off than that.
B007R21JJK|5.0|Worked just as posted.  I would recommend this if you are thinking about upgrading to a new motherboard.  OC was easy 1 click and your running.
