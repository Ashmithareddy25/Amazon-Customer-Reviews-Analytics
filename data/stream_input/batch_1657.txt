B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another good book on one of my favorite charterers Jack is a Classic Hero in every sense of the word
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this book to be boring and irrelevant.  I don't recommend it to anyone.  It read like the moanings of a sex-starved adolescent living in fantasy. There was no real character development.  Very repetitive dialogue with the main character blushing and flushing on one page after the other.  The book ended in a trite manner as if the author just ran out of words.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I have only completed about 1/3 of the book \\"Winter of the World\\". While it is worth reading, I can already tell it is not among Ken Follett's beast works. It is not as mesmerizing as \\"World Without End\\" and \\"Pillers of the Earth\\" or all of the author's earlier work. Even though it is the only Ken Follett book I can put down, it beats the pants off most of the many books I have read lately.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book was interesting enough for me to purchase the second book in the trilogy.  More story and less sex would make it a better read.
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|We liked this movie. It has interesting characters and subject that is at times funny, sad and touching. I would recommend it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is the app for you. Its very very affiviant in every way and that's it! oh you need to get this app.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. My favorite part... the speech! What more could I ask for?  it was fun and entertaining!  Brought back memories of my pregnancies. Great multiple stories intertwined!  Loved the last scene!!!!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A quiet friend recommended this to me saying she thought of me while reading it.  I enjoy it thoroughly.  I appreciate the research the author has done to make her point using examples from business and psychological research. It is affirming to quiet people, but doesn't come off as self help. Good reading for any temperament.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|Amazing!  It slowly grabbed me.  Brought me in a twirl until we were nose to nose... Then spun me out leaving me wanting more!!!! Ugh!!!! What a great \\"I thought it wouldn't happen- you got me!\\" ending!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|You do nothing but tap the screen and coins fall.  After about two minutes maximum your 50 coins are gone and you have to spend real money to get more.  For what?  Another chance to tap the screen over and over again and watch coins fall over the edge with a couple of toys thrown in for interest.  I cannot believe this ever came on the market except to steal people s money.
B0095R64AO|5.0|Segel's movies always leave me with my jaw on the floor! He lovable and then you want to almost dislike him and then he picks you right back up again. It was shocking in some parts and funny and charming. It felt longer than it should have. But overall I really enjoyed it.
0316228532|1.0|When I discovered that J.K. Rowling was writing an adult book, I was thrilled. I did not have unrealistic expectation by thinking this talee would be sweet and mysterious, I expected good writing,an interesting plot and a marvelous adventure. Unfortunately, what I received was a vile and painfully dissapointing read. After reading 380 pages, I felt so disgusted and dirty I had to stop reading the book.<br /><br />First, let me say, there are numerous characters in the book (over 20) and they are all various levels of vileness. I sturggled along hoping to find a protagonist I could get behind and cheer for; yet, I continue to discover more and more scenes that made me like the characters less and less. Characters use each other without remorse or a moral compass, there are scenes after scenes of physical abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, profanity, and rape that you just feel dirty. Even the children in this book are without moral fiber. In truth the only reason I made it to page 350 is because this book was written by J.K. Rowlings. Yes, the book is well written but that does not matter when there is nothing else to recommend it.<br /><br />I will not recap the storyline because the book summary accomplishes providing the prospective reader with the overall idea; however, this is not a mystery but rather a trip into depravity. It is not often that I am this brutal in a review. However, don't waste your money on this one, it just isn't worth your time. Besides, I would like to spare you the disgust I experienced.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is definitely a great game.  I have to get my 6-year-old grand-nephew to teach me the tricks.  I have figured out some of them, but some configurations are tough to beat.  I don't particularly care spending about 45 minutes  completing a level, but you gotta do what you gotta do.  Even though a bit frustrating, it's fun and keeps me entertained.

B003MC5N28|5.0|This is a wonderful book for young and old alike. It really got my 11 year old thinking and talking, not always an easy job.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Seal team Six member has written an account of the events, plans and strategy for the pursuit and finally killing of OBL. One never knows what is truth and what is fabricated when govt is involved. But, for me, a Seal Team Six member's account is more likely to be closer to the truth than any other account. Good book.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This was a selected book club read.  I wasn't sure it was my kind of book but once started really didn't want to put down. I found the author's honesty and timing were impeccable. Her trip on the Trail may have wandered but her words and action were spot on for a woman who set out to conquer.  I admire her tenacity and will and fearlessness. I am a fan of Ms. Strayed and will look forward to more of her writing.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I don't generally go for the teenage girl who falls for the older guy she can't have.  This book is SO MUCH MORE than that.  It's a great story that I've read through twice already.
0786956291|3.0|When i got this in the mail, some of the pieces were missing , i.e. the power cards, and the character sheets
0345803507|5.0|This book is awesome. I loved every word of it! Now is one of my favorite books of all time.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|fast paced true reacher style loved it can't wait for next reacher book to come out the storyline will hold you breathless till you catch up amazing
0525953728|5.0|I do not normally read a lot of books. I got this book with high expectations of it being good and it meet every expectation. I enjoyed the whole book from start to finish.I felt like I was there sometimes, it ws so intense in detail and description.
0143121006|4.0|A good page-turner and a great book to read before a trip to Beijing. I read a number of books on China before my trip last month and found this one was very helpful in describing the city and the architecture pre Mao. I even made a special trip to walk through the foreign quarter to see the areas depicted in the book.  Sadly much of what was described was demolished during the Cultural Revolution. The plot is well developed, as are the characters - you really feel you are there during the investigation.<br /><br />Denver Mullican
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Thank God I bought it on Kindle.  My conscience could not cope with the death of trees to make the paper to print this piece of boring crap
B007MB5OCE|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book. It had great reviews.  Everybody was reading it, or so it seemed.  I had to stop about half way through. I rarely abandon a book, but the plot became so tedious and bizarre that I couldn't go on. Life is short. I have a lot of better things to do than plow through this sort of nonsense.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It took a little bit to get into but I ended up really enjoying this well written book. I have never read a book from this author, but I will read another one next.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I picked this book at random after reading a bit of the description on Amazon. It's a very good read...both touching and surprising. The characters come to life through an interesting juxtaposition of past and present. There is no fairytale happpiness here, and yet, it is a lovely story that leaves you with a smile and a sense of satisfaction that sometimes the most unlikely encounters turn out for the best.
B00931JMRE|5.0|Back to their '70s style of playing..........their '80s stuff never worked for me.....this new album takes me back to what I grew up listening to in the early '70s.......
B000N2HCM4|4.0|I found this book to be an interesting insight into our President's childhood and his personal self-discovery.<br /><br />Like many people who had an absent parent in their lives, he took the time to find out about the father he never really knew.  He visited his father's homeland, meet his half-siblings and relatives and learn that his father was not the successful man of the world that he thought he was, but that he was a dreamer who saw great things for himself but suffered the failures in life that many people do. And like many, he sought solace with alcohol.<br /><br />Barack also had to deal with his own racial identity because most of the world uses skin color to determine the social standing of each individual. Since there was no one in his home to serve as a role model to advise him in understanding how he fits into a such a world, he had to learn it himself by personal observation and interaction with both white and black people.<br /><br />Like anyone else, he had to grow up experiencing all of the thoughts, feelings and confusion that teens and young adults have, to become the person they are as an adult. We each choose a path that defines our life. Barack wanted to use his skills to help others help themselves.<br /><br />I don't understand all of the negative remarks by people that appear to have taken every sentence in this book as proof of some conspiracy to destroy America - it's absurd! One of the other reviews even uses quotes attributed to this book that don't actually appear in the book at all (fortunately, the Kindle version allows for searching the entire book). I believe that the people who write such reviews did so without actually reading the book. Such tactics drives me further away from that side of the political spectrum.<br /><br />And finally, I liked Barack's grandparents. They were real people - they had faults but were good people and great grandparents. I would have enjoyed having a beer Stanley and I'm sure that Barack misses him.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it's not a literary masterpiece but a great insight to our 44th President, written well before his presidency.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|James Cameron once again proves he is a master director.  The technical production values do excel. Special effects are just as ground breaking as the critics say. However, the plot is tired and recycled. It's essentially the story of Pocahontas.  Indigenous man attacked by the evil white foreigners is the theme, and the secret superlative power of nature over western machine prevails.  A completely new story would have been refreshing and thrilling.  Instead we are given blue Smurf Indians in outer space.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This is perfect for timing your meditation.  In additon there is a link to view people all over the world and in your own local area who are joining you in meditation thougout the day.  Great app, I love it!
B00932A2MC|5.0|Even though this movie didn't do as well as hoped in the Theaters, I truly Loved It!! A precitable plot line, but well acted, with great special effects that made it thoroughly entertaining!! (Plus Vampire Eric being in the movie was a huge bonus)
B008BDZOZY|4.0|You have to hand it to Byrne for avoiding the mainstream yet continually coming up with memorable music for the past 35 years. He is undoubtedly a one-of-a-kind artist in the pop music world. I'd go so far as to say that he is the godfather of what is today known as Indie pop/rock. With each release, Byrne successful (more or less) challenges his listeners to embrace something new.<br /><br />With \\"Love This Giant\\" it is the addition of St. Vincent and the fact that each track is based around particular horn section arrangements--something that is unique in itself--I can't think of anyone else in the past 35 years that has attempted to make music such as this. That being said, it is still very much recognizable as something David Byrne would do. He always puts his undeniable, idiosyncratic stamp on whatever he does, thus making it totally David Byrne. St. Vincent, on the other hand, is less unique. I think she has trouble differentiating herself from Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, Regina Spektor, Adele, P!nk, Feist, Bjork, etc. There's so many Indie female singer/songwriters today, that St. Vincent sort of blends in.<br /><br />At first listen, \\"Love This Giant\\" didn't quite strike my liking, but after listening for two weeks straight, I find it quite enjoyable. Once I got my head around the horn arrangements and the lyrics and melody lines, everything started to hook itself into my mind. From first single (and excellent video) \\"Who\\", with its quintessential Byrne shouts and intellectual solipsisms about love, to \\"Ice Age\\" where St. Vincent latches on. To \\"I Am An Ape\\", \\"I Should Watch T.V.\\", \\"Optimist\\"--which for me might be my favorite track here.<br /><br />This isn't to say that \\"Love This Giant\\" hasn't any weak points. No, it does, especially at the end. \\"Lightning\\" might be the weakest track here along with \\"The One Who Broke Your Heart\\" and \\"Outside Space And Time\\". I deduct one star for this trio that closes the album on a somewhat weak note.<br /><br />So, is \\"Love This Giant\\" as good as 2008's Byrne/Eno collaboration, \\"Everything That Happens Will Happen Today\\"? No. Is it equal to, or better than, 2010's collaboration with Fatboy Slim, \\"Here Lies Love\\"? Yes. I'd say that \\"Love This Giant\\" is more focused, more succinct, and obviously, by default, much more brief and to the point than \\"Here Lies Love\\"--which certainly had its own merits to be sure.<br /><br />Also, let's take a moment to talk about collaborations. Don't you think St. Vincent is an odd choice, and a rather weak one? I mean, just think about who Byrne could have chosen. Sure, he's worked with Brian Eno, and that's a well established and logical collaboration. Working with Fatboy Slim was unusual, but also a rather weak choice. I mean, let's do some interesting pairings here such as Byrne/Tori Amos, now that would be interesting, or Byrne/Bjork, wouldn't that be something exciting? What about Byrne/Laurie Anderson? Two egghead intellectuals battling it out? How about Byrne/Peter Gabriel? Maybe these would all be obvious choices? How about Byrne/Trent Reznor? Byrne/Pitbull? Byrne/Shakira? The possibilities are endless. All I know is that when I saw he was working with St. Vincent I said to myself, who is that? I checked her music out, but I didn't think she was the right choice for Byrne. I mean, she's done just fine on \\"Love This Giant\\", but like Fatboy Slim, I felt Byrne could have done far better in choosing a collaborative partner.<br /><br />So here's how \\"Love This Giant\\" compares with Byrne's previous works:<br /><br />Byrne Solo:<br /><br />1981 My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts: Three Stars<br />1989 Rei Momo: Four Stars<br />1992 Uh-Oh: Four Stars<br />1994 David Byrne: Four Stars<br />1997 Feelings: Four Stars<br />2001 Look Into The Eyeball: Three and a Half Stars<br />2004 Grown Backwards: Three and a Half Stars<br />2008 Everything That Happens Will Happen Today: Four Stars<br />2010 Here Lies Love: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 Love This Giant: Four Stars<br /><br />With Talking Heads:<br /><br />1977 Talking Heads '77: Five Stars<br />1978 More Songs About Buildings And Food: Five Stars<br />1979 Fear Of Music: Five Stars<br />1980 Remain In Light: Five Stars<br />1982 The Name Of This Band Is Talking Heads: Three Stars<br />1983 Speaking In Tongues: Four Stars<br />1984 Stop Making Sense: Five Stars<br />1985 Little Creatures: Four Stars<br />1986 True Stories: Four Stars<br />1988 Naked: Four Starsr Stars<br /><br />With Talking Heads:<br /><br />1977 Talking Heads '77: Five Stars<br />1978 More Songs About Buildings And Food: Five Stars<br />1979 Fear Of Music: Five Stars<br />1980 Remain In Light: Five Stars<br />1982 The Name Of This Band Is Talking Heads: Three Stars<br />1983 Speaking In Tongues: Four Stars<br />1984 Stop Making Sense: Five Stars<br />1985 Little Creatures: Four Stars<br />1986 True Stories: Four Stars<br />1988 Naked: Four Stars
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app got for Kindle fire love all the info it provides. Also downloaded to Android phone and the price was right.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I initially bought Wool, Book 1 as an Amazon special, then Book 2.  I finally decided I HAD to have the Omnibus edition and was not disappointed.  Science fiction is not my favorite genre, in fact, something I can take in limited amounts.  This story hooks you from the very beginning and keeps your interest.  It's a book I will definitely be reading again before much longer.<br /><br />I previously was a snob when it came to my book selections (fiction and non-fiction).  If it wasn't on the NY Times bestseller list,then why bother purchasing? Thank you Hugh Howey for showing me the error of my ways through such an enjoyable experience!
1609611543|5.0|After reading Wheat Belly, I began the journey of eliminating wheat and having on an occasional basis. Within 24 hours my chronic heartburn dissipated. I began to lose weight and which continues to be about 1 pound per week.  I am so thankful to Dr. Davis.  I look forward to this journey since it is easy.  I am also prediabetic and look forward to my blood sugars staying at normal ranges.  I just want to tell everybody about this revelation.
1594744769|4.0|This is an imaginative story written for young adults.  The author seems to have been influenced by the likes of Edgar Rice Burroughs,  J.M.Barrie, and J.K. Rowling.  The story itself isn't particularly ground breaking in style, but it is pleasant and reads easily.  What really makes this book so  interesting is the incorporation of many vintage photographs.  This makes for a delightful book that hearkens back to the adventure stories published regularly a few generations ago. I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />One note: though I normally purchase most of my reading material in a kindle version, this book is truer to spirit in a physical book form such as hardback or paperback.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|The movie was enjoyable, but I found it disappointing. Perhaps I was expecting too much with Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton among the cast. I enjoy their performances tremendously in \\"Downton Abbey.\\"
B000I186FW|5.0|Good quality. Excellent sound and streaming was pretty fast. Hope you continue like that guys! Netflix is definitely losing market! Cheers!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun to play and I really enjoy it.  I hope they come out with more game sets.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great to fill in some down time,  but feel free to set it down if you have real work to do cuz it loads fast and you can pick right up where you left off.  Very realistic in the angle of reaction to where you drop your coins.
B009EAO38C|5.0|great songs on piano and cellos.  What could possibly not be absolutely perfect about that? So beautiful and relaxing.  I couldn't wait to buy their album,  even though there are some repeats from the album they sold through their website to \\"founders\\".
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This production was disappointing hence the average review.  I think it would have been a lot better with more of the queen as the central character.  Perhaps the sequel will explore this avenue as Show White (who's not so 'white') may not be in the followup.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|It's raucous, profane, and even a bit \\"naughty.\\" It's punk-inspired power pop grind with great melodies, loud guitars, and a whole lot of f-bombs. It's fun without being watered down--pop music for grown-ups!! A highlight is \\"Sweet 16,\\" a lovely little ode to Billie Joe's wife. I love this album and can't stop listening to it. If I could change anything, I would just make it longer.

0525953728|4.0|Considering the subject matter and the manner in which this book was written, I could only give it 4 stars. Very light, fast reading and somewhat interesting. In the hands of an experienced, talented writer, it would have made much better reading.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The bedroom scenes and everywhere else their escapades go are awesome. The little twist with the psycho ex sub was fun to follow.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the first book and was excited to read the second one but was afraid I might be let down, because of how good the first one was.That was not the case.I was very pleased after reading it and truely thought that the second book was even better than the first one.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think the book was wonderfully written and wish that there will be a forth book.<br />This was also very sexy,exciting,mysterious,and intreging to read.
B00846REIS|5.0|I just finished reading the Fifty Shades Trilogy when a friend told told me about this book \\"Bared To You\\".  In the beginning, it seemed that the plot was similar to fifty shades but as the book went on it became different and more intriguing.  The only thing I didn't like is that the end of the book leaves you without a conclusion. I realize this was done on purpose to encourage you to buy the next book in the series. Unfortunately, the book is not out yet and I wanted to read it right away after finishing the first one.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Very good, emotional, and full of smiles! Best book i've read in a while. Great plot. A definite must reaf!
B00932A2MC|3.0|This is NOT high art.  However, for a loud, obnoxious, fun film, Battleship is your movie.  The acting is alright, but the WWII veterans really make the movie.
B007PFD90G|5.0|Rushdie's memoir is the story of the power of the written word which is today in danger of being drowned out by viral e-mails, insipid journalism, and the power of cash in the media, politics and judiciary.  One wonders how many thinking people with the ability to analyze events and situations are left in society.  This is the story of how a victim soon becomes characterized as the victimizer and how Rushdie struggles to regain his identity and his voice.  The story is a well written and engaging as all his works of fiction.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|It was interesting to get into the mindset of a Navy Seal. In a sense I'm proud that we have such outstanding individuals in service of our country; conversely it is disturbing that we train killers who crave \\"action\\" in the extreme and cannot have a normal life without it. Mark Owen is no Hemingway; his writing is simplistic and at times awkward. He repeats himself a lot. Nonetheless I'm glad I read the book as it gave me a glimpse of his world. He appears sincere and any talk of his betraying secrets is rubbish. Thank you \\"Mark Owen\\".
B00174TKGI|5.0|Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are at the top of their game in this movie. The fact that is based on a true story makes it far more compelling as well. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and watch it a couple times! You won't be disappointed!

B008RTE066|5.0|This Review is for the box set edition of  The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour 2012 release. I have used  the basic content in order as listed in the press release and on the box itself and will elaborate on it based on my viewing of  both the Blu Ray and DVD  set which I was lucky enough to receive on October 5th.<br /> The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour is basically their 1967 home movie which bewildered audiences at the time.<br />Today it allows us to look back at a time when the Summer of Love seemed endless and possibilities were limitless.<br />This box set contains the DVD & Blu-Ray, as well as a very nice softcover 60 page book with background information, photographs and production notes.The book also contains period reviews of the film,which were not so kind.and also includes a faithful reproduction of the mono double 7\\" vinyl EP of the films six  Beatles songs.The discs are pressed in the USA on reproduction Parlophone labels.,and mirror the original  British issue which accompanied the films 1967 TV premiere.The EP is remastered,possibly from the 2009 Mono Masters set,but I'm not sure.<br /><br />Special Features include:<br /><br />Director's Commentary - by Paul McCartney. Very anecdotal,with several interesting McCartneyesque quips,and some sharp barbs at BBC censors.<br /><br />The Making of Magical Mystery Tour (19m 05s) - Features interviews with Paul and Ringo, along with other cast members and crew. Includes unseen footage.Very enjoyable,and adds some much needed background to the proceedings<br /><br />Ringo the actor (2m 30s) - Ringo describes his role in the film and mentions his other acting experiences.<br /><br />Meet The Supporting Cast (11m 27s) -  Nat Jackley, Jessie Robins, Ivor Cutler, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Victor Spinetti, George Claydon, and Derek Royle are profiled.Again,not essential,but adds a little to the depth of the filmby way of additional outtake footage.<br /><br />`Your Mother Should Know' (2m 35s)<br />`Blue Jay Way' (3m 53s)<br />`The Fool On The Hill' (3m 05s)<br />- These three songs are presented in previously unseen  edited editions.  These alternate versions will especially be interesting to Beatle collectors,as they have not been released officially or bootlegged.They are,however,not quite as crisp visually as the remastered film itself.<br /><br />`Hello Goodbye' (3m 24s), as featured in Top of the Pops 1967<br />- The Beatles had the BBC  film them in the editing process  when they were working on Magical Mystery Tour. the resulting film was edited  to create a promo which was subsequently  broadcast on Top of the Pops.  Done in Black and white,this is a great addition to any Beatles collection and it also makes its DVD debut here.<br /><br />Nat's Dream (2m 50s) - This deleted scene from the original film was directed by John Lennon  and features Nat Jackley.<br /> Of interest to Beatle collectors is the music soundtrack to this deleted scene,\\"Shirley's Wild Accordion\\",a Lennon-McCartney instrumental composition,recorded at Abbey Road during the Blue Jay Way sessions on October 12,1967. and produced By John Lennon. This features Shirley Evans on accordion,Paul McCartney on maraca,with some incidental background yelling,and Ringo Starr on drums.Never released until now.<br /><br />Ivor Cutler - `I'm Going In A Field' (2m 35s) - Cutler  is featured performing on a keyboard `I'm Going In A Field',  and it is the weakest of all the bonus material,.This deleted scene features no other cast members.<br /><br />Traffic - `Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush' (1m 53s) -Traffic's excellent  `Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush',is slightly reminiscent of the Strawberry fields forever Beatles promo. It was commissioned by The Beatles who at one point planned to include it in the film.It survives today as an outtake.<br /><br />All in all this box set is a beautifully packaged  commemorative edition,with the book containing a diary of events as they unfolded.<br />The DVDs are in a laminated  folder and individually enclosed in laminated mini sleeves for protection.<br />The vinyl  mono EP is also a faithful reproduction,but the sleeves seem a little too snug for the enclosed discs.The remastered film is beautifully reproduced ,both  visually and musically.I will have listen more closely to note sonic differences between the Blue Ray and the regular DVD.At present,to my ear The Blue Ray  5.1 stereo is about as good as it gets.<br />As far as the film itself,It should be looked at for what it is,53 minutes of the Beatles being themselves.That should be good enough for anyone.<br />As far as the price,I hedged a bit at first,but such a quality package makes it an essential purchase for the avid Beatle collector.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This is probably one of the weakest stories in the series.  Love Jack read all these books but this isn't a very exciting story.  I almost feel as if Jack is just a bystander.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|After reading the whole book at the end I must say I really like it. The first 50% of the book (kindle) was kind of lukewarm. Many of the characters were there and the storytelling is really nice and consistent but think of it as an intro (a long one). The second half was really enjoyable and it was a page-turner. I don't really know why. There's everything, witches, vampires, demons, romance, skin-cutting action, spells, time-traveling and a lot of attention to details. Also the romance is not twilight style as much as I would like to agree with others, it's mature and more profound. The main characters are developed get you thinking what would you do in those situations. I'm eager to read the second book \\"Shadow of Night\\" and thank you Deborah for this nice book.
B0060D3BWK|5.0|Still a great view suitable for all members of a family! I took my kids to see this when it came out in theatres years ago and I just watched it with my grandkids. What a great time to relate with your family and have a little Halloween fun!
B003UPPO2G|4.0|Bought this more for my wife.<br /><br />Back in the day, when the Bee Gees played, I countered with Led Zeppelin and Van Halen.<br /><br />They did grow on me, but I was never a 'disco' fan.<br /><br />This DVD is good.<br /><br />I've got a fat Yamaha Amp,  and Polk Audio Left, Center, Right speakers and a Velodyne subwoofer.<br /><br />The audio production sounds very good.<br /><br />The entire production is good.<br /><br />Even if the Bee Gees are not your favorite (I fall in this group), it's a nice video to put on.<br /><br />Four Stars, 5 if I was a BeeGees fan.<br /><br />Note: If this does not sound right on your stereo, you need to tune your amp. Most modern amps are highly tunable, like Yamaha.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I'm an adult and I got addicted to it. Very challenging and had the same style of \\"where is my water\\". So if you like that one and is looking for more levels, I recommend this game
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|Short and simple about this for-whatever-reason-i-am-not-educated-on-low-profile gem that begs you to cheer for weirdness and the quintessential underdog / Everyman / average Joe / David to come out on top from the start:<br />If you want a perfectly paced 'Merican film good time, this is it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very nice game to pass the time. Be aware! Once you start, it's hard to put it away! I recommend!
B0087HT36U|4.0|This game is a typical defense setup but this one is boring. I would not recommend this game to someone else but it worked fine in my GS2 skyrocket.<br /><br />As updates have been provided the developer has made this game into something more entertaining.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Nice to pass the time, but very limited puzzles in the free version. At the same time, not a game that is worth buying the full version of it. So I guess you have to be happy with what you get for the price
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I wish I would have upgraded my headphones and gotten the E6 along time ago. I've always wondered how much of a difference it would make. However for the money it is absolutely worth it. It is very small and light which makes it portable and get good enough battery life to be able to listen to music for 4 to 5 hours.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Books like this are not for everyone, but I loved it. It made me giggle and at the same time had a fair amount action. I enjoyed the writing style and the dialogue.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2.5 year old son loves this! The graphics are colorful &amp; he also loves popping the balloons or bubbles after finishing a puzzle.
B00913DPW2|2.0|I was playing this game for awhile and having a great time until I came to the tile puzzle. I have been working on it for 4 hours. What a waste of time.
B002MJM84S|5.0|Mark Knopfler's album Get Lucky is wonderful from start to finish. Packed with tunes that will take the listener on a visual and emotional ride. Mark has the<br /><br />ability to tell stories in his songs that help the listener see a glimpse  of what Mark was writing the song about and often a very clear vision. This is a song writer<br /><br />that can write a song about the demise of a merchant ship that will leave the listener sad over a damn boat! Mark is one of our great song writers of our time.<br /><br />Don't miss this or any of the other solo albums he has done sense he left Dire Straights.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|Amazing detail. A comprehensive read of the many complex personalities and events that shaped the war. All the reasons why war should never be the response to conflict. That people are capable of such barbaric behavior is stunning. Should be a must read in college.
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|I have big experience working with steadicams and I don't recommend this steadicam because the main elbow that you twist to adjust has quite a bit of play which can not be tightened because then it won't adjust. That's why it's VERY hard to set up dynamic balance.<br />If they correct this issue it will be good device for it's money.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is a very fun resource gathering game. The addition of combat and conquering new territories sets this one apart from the others.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|ALL OF MICHAEL CONNELLY'S BOOKS ARE VERY GOOD READS, ENTERTAINING AND EXTREMELY GOOD PLOTS. \\"tHE OVERLOOK\\" WAS REALLY ONE HIS BEST WITH AAND WHICH ISA TOTAL SURPISE. BUY IT FROM AMAZON...YOU'LL LOVE IT AND WILL BE ADDICTED TO THE REST OF HIS HARRY BOSCH BOOKS. PETER D SMITH
B004UIOUHC|3.0|Opera, has always been a browser that got used by me, and now quite often, on my Android tablets (though note there is a version of Opera that works on the MIPS processors, and I use that particular version on my Cruz T301!)  But this version works quite well on the standard ARM processors, and I have nothing to complain about it.  It does work with Flash video, an important point for my other tablet, which handle flash content. It seems to be quite stable even when looking at websites as a PC.  It is also rather easy to specify what directory I want something downloaded, which is almost invariably one on my SD card.<br /><br />One of the most important points!  It can be installed on your SD card.  I really like programs that can do that.<br /><br />It is just a well working browser, it's free so try it out. I have to say on Android systems I'm very eclectic about browsers. I easily switch between Opera, Dolphin, and Skyfire. Especially on my Cruz T301 which doesn't natively handle Flash, but the Skyfire people have the setup to translate Flash into what my older Cruz tablet can handle.<br /><br />Anyway, do I recommend Opera considering its price (its free) and its stability? -- a very strong, yes.
0316228532|1.0|If this book was written by anyone else no publisher would have printed it.  My thought is that this was an initial attempt at writing long before her popular series, and was published under the theory that her name alone would create millions of copies sold.  Alas, we fell for it.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|What a fun book. I couldn't wait or stop reading to see what adventure would happen next. The author tied all of them back or forward to seemingly meaningless events. This type of action made you pay attention to each detail. I don't normally read this type of book, but I'm glad I did. You could tell it has been translated to Engllish by some of the phrases and words used. This only added to the quirkiness of the story. Try it, even the death and destruction make you laugh.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Great Watch right out of the box. Only con is the dial to set the time and date is difficult to use, however you don't have to use it that much if you wear the watch daily. The watch looks good on and has kept time accurately for over one month.This is more a casual every-day watch than a dress watch but can be used for both if your not picky about dress watches.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this app ! it is so much fun to play and it's kind of addictive .this is a awesome app and I highly suggest playing it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love the app. Add items to watch list and no matter where i am i get a notification. Then i can watch my bid or change my bid
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I expected it be awesome,  but it not. its OK but not great though. I have to admit I was pretty addicted to it at first and before you know it I got bored.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Highly enjoyable storytelling romp... I love the nuances and the Qvothe character. Gotta say I enjoyed it more than reading the last george martin book dance with dragons, no question.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|Pretty good action. Lots of high tech effects. Fairly fun to watch if you have some time on your hands.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|The major down side is that it is not a sapphire glass, but for the price I would not expect that anyway!<br />Oh! And the size seems a little smaller on the wrist! The case is big, but the actual viewing area is small, makes its looks like a tiny watch!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Totally cool game. would recommend for any age. The most additive game I have ever seen I gave it five stars.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Great price, like new condition, enjoy the fresh new update to good ole' Christmas favorites, already listening in my car even though not the Holidays!
B001AU8ZLK|4.0|This is my first Coldplay album and I really like the sound. The instrumentals are fantastic, and the vocals really blend in with the music. It is a New Wave type of music with some strands of Rock thrown in. I would highly recommend this album.
B0055MBQOM|4.0|I use my Color Munki Display with a late 2008 15\\" Mac Book Pro.<br />Its amazing to see the initial before and after views after the first calibration.<br />I started by downloading the lastest version of the software from their website, installed it, then connected the device.<br />Its super simple to setup. Even the advanced setup option, which is the best option to use in my opinion, is completely guided and easy.<br />Depending on the type of screen you have, there are some controls, specifically contrast and brightness, that you may not have the ability to control.  There are points during the setup when you'll be prompted to adjust these controls if you can, or just skip them if you can't.<br />The whole setup up process takes a little less than 10 minutes to complete.<br />You have to option to have the device monitor the ambient light in your workspace and automatically adjust the screen brightness if that light level changes. To use this, the device stays plugged into a USB port and sits on your desk.  This is nice if you work in an aera where the light changes.<br /><br />You also have the ability to calibrate projectors.<br /><br />I choose the ColorMunki over the [[ASIN:B006TF37H8 Datacolor Spyder4Pro S4P100]] because of the Rebate offer that they had available at the time I purchased it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoy Follett'e writing. Great way to learn history through how characters may have lived during it. I will impatiently wait for the third book of this trilogy.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|If you enjoy classic rock you must own this product. Blondie's hit 'The Tide Is High\\" has always been one of my favorites.
B00190N4E4|5.0|This is a beautifully acted and filmed movie!!!  As profound and pertinent today as when it came out back in the 80's.  It is a classic in my opinion!!  Ghandi's life is so inspiring and profound and teaches so much if/when we are open and have the courage to live what we know to be true as he did.  Everyone will benefit by seeing this movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|Just a great game to break up the day.Takes lots of practice to get good at it. A very nice game which you will enjoy. Temple Run BRAVE IS ALSO Excellent.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|A very good movie all the way to the end. The acting was great and the story line works for families.
B00884GR0W|3.0|in block story lite I think that they should make it so that you can ride the horses if you make a saddle instead of just killing them. please put this in the next block story LITE update it would raise my reveiw considerably.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Author, and former Navy SEAL, Mark Owen tells what really happened the night his Navy SEAL unit entered Osama Bin Laden's compound to capture the main planner for 9-11. Written in an active tense his book will keep you reading as find out how he became the best-of-the-best in the military's special ops unit called SEALS.<br /><br />Yes, there is some political commentary in the proper context as the military are required to serve their Commander and Chief (the US president), they are allowed to lead private lives and express personal opinions in private. Owen tells about some of the comments made privately, while not on duty, in his book.<br /><br />If you want to read about what really happened the night bin Laden was captured, and to see some well drawn graphics, plus photos of where the SEALs serve you will find this in his book. Owen also included some photos showing some of the items used by SEALs.<br /><br />At the end of the book Owen states:<br /><br />\\"One of my first projects after leaving was the book. Deciding to do it wasn't easy. No one at the command thought much of the notoriety that came after the Bin Laden raid. We watched it with amusement at first, but that quickly turned to dread as more and more information leaked. We always prided ourselves for being the quiet professionals, but the more I saw coverage of the raid, the more I wanted to set the record straight.<br /><br />To date, how the mission to kill Bin Laden has been reported wrong...I felt like someone had to tell the true story. To me, the story is bigger than the raid itself and much more about the men at the command who willingly go into harm's way, sacrificing all they have to do the job. Theirs is a story that deserves to be told, and told as accurately as possible.\\"<br /><br />This clearly states why this book was written and the importance of reading it.<br /><br />In his book Owen states he will donate the majority of the book proceeds to charity. He also asks his readers to help veteran's organizations who need assistance.<br /><br />Finally, Owen lists special operations personnel who have fallen in the line of duty since September 11. Reading this list will allow you to realize what these brave military personnel have given so we may be free.<br /><br />Highly recommend.veteran's organizations who need assistance.<br /><br />Finally, Owen lists special operations personnel who have fallen in the line of duty since September 11.

B003L77GGK|5.0|Once again the show delves in with gusto - and a few surprises. I very much liked this season, with the emergence of a new story arc, new characters, and the return of our favorite characters. The acting is spot on, and the bonus features are again a much appreciated addition!
0385344333|1.0|I love the Reacher novels. I am a 71-year-old woman, maybe not your typical Reacher fan. But I've read and enjoyed every one, until this one. I really liked \\"61 Hours,\\" although some fans didn't. But this one is abysmal. I feel like I spent 61 hours in a car, driving through Nebraska corn fields. No action, no suspense, no nothing.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This season starts out with a bang - and my favorite episode of all time. I love this season for multiple reasons, but the building tension as we discover the keys to what is really going on is definitely... well, key. This is a fantastic season of \\"Supernatural\\", and should definitely be one to own if you enjoy the rest of the series!
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Normally when watching a fight flick, I expect the typical \\"Rocky\\" story line, with the down and out or undiscovered fighter who gets his dream shot.  Make no mistake - I love these movies and that's what I thought I was getting when I sat down to watch Warrior.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed, although the typical fight movie plot was only barely in evidence.  Instead, I got a well-acted movie with a fantastic story about a broken family that might almost come together again.  Everyone one of the characters is portrayed with depth.  But there's no shortage of fun fight footage either (like boxing movies, the fight scenes are a little over-done, but awfully fun to watch).
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This has got to be my favorite season of this show - the major overlying arc comes to a close, told magnificently, while another begins. The bonus features, especially the gag reel, are an absolute treasure. This is a season to be watched over and over again!
B004IAIXWK|3.0|There is a good story line. However, the relationship between Channing Tatum and his \\"friends\\" is a bit too adolescent and could have been staged in such a way that there is more of a meaningful relationship between Channing and his dance partner and less animosity from his friends because he is interested in a more meaningful artistic education and relationship.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I was very, very anxious to receive this season - I had followed along and was looking forward to all of the bonus features (along with re-watching the episodes, of course)! There were several quirky episodes, many serious, and the guest stars were thrilling to watch (not to leave out Jared and Jensen, our two main stars who did an amazing job as usual)! This season had so many good things to say about it, and I will likely be buying it on Blu-Ray at a later date just to have it. This show is a fantastic one, and I definitely recommend it!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have read all of the Lee Child \\"Reacher\\" series - he's my hero. Somewhat reminds me of a modern day the Jack McDonalds \\"Travis McGee\\". Though not the best of his creations, I still give this book high marks... Typical Reacher, kickin' tail and taking names. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lee Child.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I could not wait for the second part of the Century Trilogy.  I am absolutely hooked into the lives of the five families and am learning so much about the challenging years in which they lived.  As I was born between WW1 and WW2 I can identify with so much of what was going on.  Ken Follett does an excellent job of weaving together a good story and accurate history. I will be waiting for Part 3 with baited breath.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|love this game, great price! very additive,  cant wait for the next game! get this game you wont be sorry. very little glitches
B000JMKO3C|5.0|Outstanding and interesting from beginning to end. I admired Veronika and her personal decision.This is an example of what one can and should make a decision for ones owm  life if faced with cancer.
1423136802|5.0|This is the book series my 11yr.old started, Couldnt put it down. I was reading w/ him then he started taking the book to school. I had to get up dated @ dinner. Then the next 4 books he read w/in 1-2 days. He preorders all of Rick Riodian's books. A very engageing author.
B004LZF2LW|1.0|This app is junk. It has London time (as of this date 10/05/12) shown as UTC/GMT +2 hours. England is on summer time and the correct setting for London is UTC/GMT + ONE HOUR. To make matters worse, it appears all other time zones are calculated not from UTC/GMT as they should be, but from London time. That makes every time zone in the USA off by 1 hour. I see no way to fix this. Amazing that anyone could write and sell an app who has so little understanding of such a simple issue. I want a refund.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I especially enjoyed the ending.  I watched the movie last night and the book was much better.
B003ZTQN1I|4.0|Although this is a very good music CD it does not give me the same thrill that the songs during the movie gave me. Good but not great, I was a little let down by this CD.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|I love Sci-Fi and own a dvd copy of all the classics. I had such high hopes for this film. Sadly, it is mediocre at best. The trailer is much more exciting than the actual film. How did Ridley Scott manage to screw this one up? It could have been great but the film's dialogue and action scenes don't always make a great deal of sense. Leaving a question or two unresolved is good film making, but there are way too many questions left unanswered in Prometheus and far too many allusions to Scott's Sci Fi classic, Alien. This gives the viewer the impression that Scott's Sci Fi genious has run its course.<br /><br />There is a minor but oh-so-aggrevating short-coming to this film. The rich old man in the plot who funds the voyage to this other world has no depth to his character, making him completely unbelievable. The shoddy make-up on this actor draws way too much attention to itself, which only detracts from an already one-dimension character. The are any number of sub plots that could have worked as an excuse to make a voyage across the vast universe. This one doesn't work, it's too cartoonish. As for the make-up, really? In this day and age, that is the best Scott could manage? At the very least, Scott should have employed an elderly actor rather than a younger one who is already in the cast.<br /><br />The film is worth a look. But don't get your hopes up.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|It's a great movie that was hard to find. Amazon had the best price, gave it as a gift to my lil brother he was thrilled.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game was nice cool hot with it<br /> on point just right sect just? wow. great sect I love this game
B0090EHVMC|4.0|Well it's no Finding Nemo but the kids, boys of five and seven, really liked it.  We saw it in the theater and now have rented it at least once.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have it for free just wanted to say update is on Oct. 10 new glow stone and nether colored portal :P maybe multiplayer
B008FSCNTK|4.0|This is a great album, but I noticed Al Schmitt's absence right off.<br />It was a really dumb move to not have him on-board.<br />T-Bone probably talked her into it.<br />She shouldn't make this mistake again.<br />Al's responsible for her CDs being so great.<br />Max
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved the story and am surprised at how well the movie follows the book. I can‘t wait to finish the trilogy.
B009329Y30|4.0|Loved the actors and their portrayal of the book.  The movie followed the book pretty closely.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good love story!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|great great great enjoyed the entire cd very much so put it in the player guest played pool to it laid back with it really a overall cd to relax or dance with it i love it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Written at a level all can appreciate.  Good blend of action and background.  I am glad this was written.  As far as the controversy that surrounds the book - well, too late now. A special thanks to all current, former and future U.S. Service Members.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is popular on both the large and small screens.  But he is portrayed in wildly divergent ways.  This is why reading the original makes sense for fans.  Don't worry; these stories are not as long and boring as you would find in 'fine literature'.  They were  written for popular consumption and apparently the regular people back then preferred fast-moving stories just as much as we do now.<br /><br />The kindle version of this book is perfectly formatted, no problems there, and is quite lengthy, so you can get many hours of entertainment at a low cost per page.  Don't waste your money on a new best-seller.  Buy this instead.<br /><br />Reading the original allows you to compare the screen stories with what Doyle actually wrote and draw your own judgements about whether modern versions have stretched a point too far with their creative updates.  Is Lucy Lui (CBS) a fair replica of Watson?  Is the latest PBS version of the Holmes-Watson relationship off-base with its homosexual implications?  Was Holmes a drug addict?  Did he have Asperger's syndrome? Was he a good boxer?<br /><br />The stories also raise questions that are more difficult to answer. What the heck is brain fever? Why does Watson describe Holmes as 'bohemian'?  Was renting a flat typical for professionals in the Victorian Age?  Would Doyle have agreed with Dickens about how bad the era really was?  Reading Doyle makes me want to live in that time and place.<br /><br />Your enjoyment of Holmes on screen and in the theater will be enhanced if you read this book, whether it is for the first time or whether it is a revisit to a bygone era.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have been hooked on the Jack Reacher series since the beginning. This story doesn't disappoint in that it has Jack at odds with the establishment, but as always seeking justice and retribution throughout. In some cases the story was predictable, but as with all of the Reacher novels, I couldn't put it down and blew right through it.
B0027MJU00|2.0|I think Gillian is a great author, i read her other book Gone Girl in only a matter of days. But, this book Dark Places just didn't do it for me. Its not as exciting or fast paced. I think the plot was dull. Again though, I recommended Gone Girl to everyone i know. Read that book instead!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game is one of the best l ever play the only thing the l don't like is the only have one tile of potion available to use ....
B000L9EKL0|5.0|Gene Hackman is always good in a film. This movie is a good shoot 'em up. Just the way I like 'em.
B007TMON8M|4.0|fun building game with a bunch of different types of challenges.  wish there were more levels, so hopefully they put out updates
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My son loves this movie, and I think it's pretty adorable. The songs are catchy and it stays fairly close to the older version.
B007TML4EI|5.0|i downloaded this as a free-app-of-the-day, but i'd definitely spend a few bucks on it.<br /><br />it's a follow-up to Simple Physics.<br /><br />this time, you have to build structures to protect your crash test dummy from various onslaughts (battering rams, spears, bombs, etc)
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I love everything Blake creates. This particular ebook only lasted me ONE day. I was riveted. I love the imagery and the way he keeps me in suspense, as well as the humor he interjects. Treat yourself to ALL of his works. You'll be glad you did!
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Received the DVD in 3 days and the quality of the movie was theater perfect. I have recommended this movie to all I.U. fans.
B00138J342|5.0|I have listed to this albulm probably twenty times since I downloaded it. I enjoy the flexibility of purchasing and storing my music with Amazon.
B004QX07G4|5.0|It took me only a day to read this book (while at work). Ellen is soooo funny and she talks about random things and flips from on thing to another.   I recommend reading....funny and refreshing.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|The book was written in a very simple language and I feel a SEAL should not write about a mission and/or critize his commanding officer, the President of the United States.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|That chick cant act her way out of a bag....dialogue was horrible....boring movie overall. Expected more action then there was. Movie idea had potential but epic fail ensued.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a very good sequel to Hunger Games. It was engaging and kept my attention. Enough so that I read the  third.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Interest ing account, nothing particularly revelatory. Mostly just detailing the mission and several notable previous missions. Basically an interesting and entertaining read.
B007TMON8M|5.0|What more needs to be said? It's science for kids. They love it, and it's very challenging. Our UNSchooled children play a great deal on this app.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I started reading at 6:30 pm when I got home from work today, and I just finished about 15 minutes ago. I still haven't had dinner and it's midnight now.  I was annoyed at having to go to the restroom for taking me from my book! It was SO GOOD!  I won't bore you with a lengthy review, just know that this book is worth every moment of your time if you like compelling characters, steamy sex, romance and so much more rolled into one book.
B0012631UM|5.0|I had this album on an old VHS tape which no longer plays so I was very excited to get this album.  It takes you through the years of numerous BeeGee songs which is very delightful.  Anyone that is a fan of this group would love this album.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app literally allows me to live without paper. I am able to take notes at a meeting, keep track of my family's favorite recipes, take pictures, etc. I also love the fact that this app can be added to your PC, smartphone, Kindle, and they all sync together! Seriously the best time saving app and most useful out of all the apps that I own.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I do not like the split screen in landscape mode.  My stand only works with having my device in landscape and I have seing problems and need to have larger print.  It's very tiring to read large print with the split screen and haven't read anything since this upgrade.  If I'm not reading, I'm not buying :(  If you could tell me how to take the split screen in landscape mode off, I would greatly appreciate it and give you a better review
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great graphics, good variety of puzzles, plenty of help if you want it and hours and hours of play. Worked great on kindle fire. Very engaging and imaginative. Highly recommended. Great work developers, artists, and programmers!
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Dark, evocative, equal parts dreamy and dreary, with a sensibility bouncing between materialistic hip hop and laid-bare poetry.  Some of it is breathtaking, some is awkward, and some is bad, but it is never less than fascinating.... Even after repeat listens.
B000JMKO3C|3.0|I am definitely a big Paulo Coelho fan. I will never say bad or ok to any of his good bcoz as we all know he is a gr8 writer. But however, i didnt like this book as much I have loved reading his other books. I would say if u want to choose between any two of his books go with the other one, but if u have to choose between paulo and some other writer, by default go for Paulo.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have a kindle fire and it works. great. I even prefer it over my laptop. love this site. I actually probably spend too much time on it
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My kids 3, 4, and 6 LOVE to pretend to be doctors and vets. Many days have been spent with them \\"checking my heartbeat\\", breathing, and fixing \\"broken bones\\" with towel cast. I found Dr. Panda and downloaded it to my Kindle for the to play. They LOVE it. They get to clean the animals rooms, feed them, and mend all their boo boo's. This is a great game
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved this book and the previous book, Fall of the Giants. They are well researched and Follett uses excellent character development. I can hardly wait for the third book in this trilogy. While reading the first book, he goes into great detail about the battle of the Somme, during WWI. I then remembered that I lost two uncles in that battle, both in the British army. It brought a special meaning for me. Great writing.
B005LAIGKU|4.0|Bicycle messengers are a breed apart, particularly when plying their trade in the Big Apple! The stunt riding we see in this action flick is probably not much different from their daily death-defying duties. In this one, a messenger must get across town in a short time, so we ride along as he zips through traffic, across parks, and through stores, all the while trying to elude some guy in a silver sedan who seems determined to intercept him.<br /><br />  * Joseph Gordon-Levitt (\\"Inception\\") is the Energizer Bunny, hired at 5:30 PM to deliver a \\"Premium Rush\\" envelope to Chinatown by 7:00 PM; he was specifically requested by name. This film runs 91 minutes so we watch this in \\"real\\" time.<br />  * Dania Ramirez (\\"American Reunion\\") is his undecided girlfriend whose roommate kicks her out. She too, is a bike messenger.<br />  * Wolé Parks (lots of TV) is the gleeful competitor, not only for our hero's acclaim in the bike messenger community, but also for the affections of that lovely girlfriend.<br />  * Jamie Chung (\\"Sucker Punch\\") is an inscrutable Asian whose hard-earned money is at stake. She hired our hero.<br />  * Michael Shannon (\\"Take Shelter\\") is a relentless NYPD cop with a gambling problem.<br />  * Christopher Place (stunts in films like \\"The Lucky One,\\" \\"Safe,\\" and \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\") is the dauntless NYPD bike cop who gives our hero a run for his money. This guy is so dedicated we can't help but (sorta) root for him.<br /><br />There are very few interludes where we can take a breather: We see countless accidents where a cyclist goes head over heels through the air after being hit by taxis, car doors, garbage cans, bikes and other hazards of the trade. We come to fear that scary cop in the sedan as he pursues our hero. We very much appreciate the goose-bump moment near the end when the bike messengers rally their forces, and naturally everyone likes a happy ending.<br /><br />This PG-13 outing has very little profanity, no blowie uppie stuff, a couple of gunshots, some violence and oodles of vehicular (mostly bicycle) mayhem. I enjoyed it. Get your DVD from Amazon.com and you will too.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I wasn't sure if my friend, Kelsey, and I would enjoy the movie due to so much 'hype' regarding Kristen and the movie's producer. However, we were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed a very good movie! The effects were very well done; some in fact, were brilliantly executed.<br /><br />The acting was well done but Charlize shone brighter than anyone else! She was a POWERFUL wicked queen and gave an outstanding performance.<br /><br />One neat surprise for both of us was the awesome costumes. They were perfect for each character and attention to detail was clearly demonstrated.<br /><br />We can't wait to watch it again!
B000FC2ROU|5.0|Like other books by Murakami, it is a striking combination of 'everyday' with pure fantasy.  Keeps interest throughout with building character development and unpredictable plot twists.  Fun reading.
B0058U0EEO|5.0|Ever wanted to chill out but in an upbeat kind of way (i.e. without falling asleep)? This is the album for you. It is as if new wave - if new wave was a person - fell into some kind of chill trance and just kept dancing on. In a nutshell: awesomely hypnotic beats and atmospheres overlain with soft ethereal vocals. Excellent.
B006G7R2KW|5.0|outstanding tv series. quality of video is excellent. easy to access..user-friendly. i cannot wait for the next episode to air!!!
B008OTTRXU|5.0|This CD is a \\"must\\" for anyone who loves pop music. This beautiful Canadian singer has a lovely voice and this album is filled with freshness and fun uptempo songs. \\"Drive\\", \\"Curiosity\\", and \\"Sweetie\\" are my favorite songs. The only song that suck, is the duet with Bieber. Love Carly!!!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Mr. Child you must have run out of good story lines. This book dragged on forever and left me wishing I hadnt wasted my time reading it. Have loved all of the reacher books up to this point, but this plot was so weak I couldnt believe you let them print it. Hopefully the next will be up to your old standards. M. Jackson
B008BIZ06M|3.0|well, I guess I bought this CD based off of the one and only other Offspring CD (SMASH) that I have and.... I don't think it's fantastic. It's ok, but it's not as fun as SMASH.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I love all the Jack Reacher books,however A wanted man was a disapointment.<br />I felt the ending rather flat.....<br />I'm looking forward to the next Jack Reacher adventure.<br />All the other books have been awesome.
B004ZY0VHY|3.0|It is an interesting book to read; controversial subject and it brings up a lot of great discussion points. Would be a good book club choice. The author frames the story in a series of letters that the main character is writing to her \\"estranged\\" husband. What bothers me most, and it may seem petty but it drove me to distraction while trying to read this, is that the author seemed to have a thesaurus in front of her while she wrote and was challenging herself to use every big word in the darn thing. I can not imagine anyone using such language in writing letters to someone she knew so intimately. Even, and maybe even more so, if the purpose of the letter-writing was for self-given therapy after a tragic event.
B003L20IJM|5.0|This is an awesome movie. emma thompson returns as everyones favorite nanny in this hillarious sequel to the smash hit Nanny McPhee. this movie is just as good as the first. i love the character and the story is great. i just love these movies. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00846TRHY|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect - given the title, but the multiple star rating indicated it might have promise. Not only did it have promise, it was a very moving film and the acting was superb. I spent several hours afterwards researching the film's background story and found it to be equally amazing. This is a must watch if you care about the plight of children on the African continent!
B000O77SRC|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Bruce willis is excellent in this movie die hard is a action pack thrill ride. this movie is so awesome i love this movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B0086DBE62|4.0|My wife and I found the film to be quite a bit of fun to watch. As usual, Nathan Lane is a stitch and has some great lines. Julia Roberts looks quite hot in her dresses (it's okay to say that since my wife already knows that was the main reason I found the costuming to be entertaining as well as the film). The dwarves are a lot of fun as well. If you want an experience in opposites, watch this film and then watch Snow White and the Huntsman. The passage from light to darkness will astound you even though the story is essentially the same.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This is an awesome movie. nanny mcphee is a great movie for the whole family child and adult alike will enjoy this movie over and over again. this is one of the best nanny movies i've seen in a long time. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00979OL5A|1.0|what the heck? it takes way too long to load<br />and its not even a very good game<br />I recommend not getting it
B005VPRDAY|5.0|I bought these for my daughter for her 7th birthday. She was so excited about the purple blocks. They have great accessories for house building, and luckily for our car focused household, for a car as well. It's a great. set. Lego sets are expensive but if you look at time used over cheaper toys, they are worth it!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This isn't a fancy 3 stone system. I have bought a second one of these for the express purpose of an emergency sharpener. I keep one in an Everyday Carry bag and a second in the Camping/Bug Out Bag. Nice little product. Mostly for coarse sharpening though. This is not 600 grit or fine diamond sanding stone here. Also, it only weighs a few ounces. For what it is... I think it is a very good product.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|An amazing  true story, well written.<br />After watching part of  her interview on tv with Wayne Dyer, I ordered the book. It has such a wonderful message, I sent a copy to my son and daughter.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|In the past books about Reacher, he started off immediately with me being right there with him in a situation but in this adventure it just didn't have the suspense.  I still enjoyed the book and will buy the next one too.  Happy reading.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is the second book of the trilogy! I love both books and can't wait for number three. Ken Follett never disappoints. If you like history mixed with fiction this is for you.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom's books are always unique in the way he explores a slice of our everyday humanity for our betterment. \\"The Time Keeper\\" does that again by looking at the relevance of time in a way that frees us from its enslavement to understanding its blessings.<br /><br />For over twenty-five years, I have conducted time management seminars and authored three books. \\"The Time Keeper\\" has articulated a new perspective that advances my view and understandings on the concept of time.
B005LAII6M|2.0|With visually appealing action set-pieces and paper-thin characters, \\"Resident Evil: Retribution,\\" the fifth entry of the series based on the hit Capcom video game, gives us what exactly we expect from its origin: lots of combat scenes and a rambling narrative.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" picks up right where \\"Afterlife\\" ended, with the previous film's last scene replayed (but not in the usual way), followed by a recap of the series so far. Then the story of \\"Retribution\\" begins, about Milla Jovovich's heroine Alice, trapped inside the underwater facilities of The Umbrella Corporation. Many characters from the previous \\"Resident Evil\\" movies appear, including Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), either as her aide or enemy.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich cuts a great action heroine figure as before, and writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson provides some stylish fight choreography, but the fact that the \\"dead\\" characters have come back in the series undermines the tension considerably that was in the first (and, to a lesser degree, third) installment. Even if Alice (or whoever you like) gets killed, she will be back. This is like hitting a reset button of a game.<br /><br />Or is it that the director is making fun of game conventions? Or is it that Paul W.S. Anderson has run out of ideas to keep the story going? I don't know. He gives each character enough moment to fight, but not the reason why he or she should be fighting. This is not to say \\"Retribution\\" is boring; it is just that with nothing at stake for Alice to win or lose, we don't care anymore.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Sad to see Child is at the end of his writing days. This was the worst book I have read in a long time and I waited for so long to come out. I 'm still not sure what the book was about!  Too much nonsense even for Jack Reacher. If you are a fan I know you won't want to miss another Reacher book, but this one will leave a bad taste in your mouth.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The lovely saga of the Starks continues as Martin skillfully weaves plot lines in this newest chapter of the Game of Thrones series. The clash of evil against good heats up as dragons take to the air with treachery at every turn. If only Ned could see how it all unfolded. Deservedly addicting. Thanks Mr. Martin for another chapter in this rollicking adventure.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|the book was entertaining but with the exception of the prize turkey at the end of the shoot, it is similar to all the SOG, SF experiences that have been penned through the years. Entertaining and a good read for warriors or future warriors.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|an awesome third book one of the best in this thrilling seiris cant wait for next year! i cried my eyes out at the end but this book is truely enchanting and it only really makes sence if you have read mosr of his books but it was rely realy awesome
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game, works very similar to a 'real' coin drop game, and the powerups make for a nice addition. The puzzles are decent, though I would have liked a better 'reward' for finishing them
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I have developed a respect for the author. I even liked the second book (some parts). But the third one is a total bore. She doesn't know how to do military things, and the things she's good at - they are not there.
B0098VXE50|1.0|This movie was supposed to be visually stunning, but all that was lost when watching on Amazon instant video.<br /><br />I even downloaded to my pc, but this did nothing to improve resolution. Netflix is by far the better instant video.
B008X8QCTO|1.0|Unlike others who were surprised to find the additional charge for the bonus \\"Collector's Edition\\", I went into the purchase knowing that based on their reviews and was fine with it. The supernatural themed games with hidden objects is very hit and miss, so I was willing to overlook that based on that being the major complaint.<br /><br />After buying the game, I assumed it had downloaded in moments and cringed to think how small the game must be. I was pleasantly surprised for a moment to find out it was just the installer program that has been downloaded. So, I went ahead and connected to my WiFi and began to download the 250 MB program. Apparently the server the developer uses likes to drop, a lot. So it took four tries and it finally downloaded. I figured I was done, but there was another 450 MB to download. So the download began and kept dropping me. During this time, I was forced to uninstall items because at all times I had to have 450 MB free for the installation when it began again. Even if 150 MB already had downloaded. So, I removed Apps and music and finally had it downloaded.<br /><br />Then I notice a few items of concern:<br /><br />The company's logo is the WordPress logo's \\"W\\" that has been cutout to act as their own. The Weird Park Storyline is also stolen completely from an Indie Author. Basically, there is nothing original outside of the artwork (with many characters resembling characters from Killjoy, Batman and others you can pick up on fairly easily.<br /><br />Maybe I have read too many horror books, especially by indie authors like Scott Nicholson, Joel M. Andre, Allen Leverone to name a few. Or seen too many films, such as Killjoy, or \\"The Park\\" which you will notice looks very familiar after playing the game.
0307592731|2.0|The best part of this book were the first few chapters and the last one.  The rest was one long self-indulgent, self-centered, pity party.  I liked her - at first.  Her frank, raw, and naked narrative about her mother's death, the loss of her family, her family's poverty growing up was compelling.  But then she devolves into years of self-destruction.  I found myself relating to her in many ways but she she lost me any my empathy along the way and I was disgusted when she got to the part about her mother's horse.  I won't spoil it here.  I couldn't believe she was so ill-prepared for her journey she actually never even tried on her backpack before hand and failed to realize how heavy it would be.  That was just plain lame.  I had hoped there would be something in this book that would be inspirational or instructional - but there was not.  At least not for me.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Loved this film. Wonderful story, beautifully filmed and a fine cast, what more could you want.<br />I would highly recommend this film ,good for the whole family.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Seriously, these \\"UV\\" rants are now getting old.  We get it: UV sucks.  Always is and always shall be.  But please, folks, discuss this in forums, not in a review form.  Does not help the film at all. You're making the overall ratings unnecessarily worse.<br /><br />As for the film (something that everyone should be discussing!), it may not be as good or better than The Dark Knight, but it's definitely one of those sequels that everyone should take a look.  Action scenes are done well, Bane is surprising being taken in a serious role, and the story is great, yet a bit flawed (though, not in a grand scale). Whether or not it has a forced UV copy, it's a must-buy release. 8/10
B008KRJWEK|4.0|this game is seriously addicting!glue mobile Inc. has done it again.you need to move your device(works great with kindle fire)  and avoid cars and kill some mutants while trying to get off the mutants that run to your car and SWEET_!!!!!!!
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|Seemed like a great FAOTD, but it asks for money on install, then frequently updates, adding permissions with EVERY update! The permissions list is the longest I have ever seen on an app, ever, and appears to be doing more with my phone than I am. Loved the deal, but it's time to uninstall.
B004XIZN5M|4.0|I bought this book on sale for Kindle ($1) exactly one year ago. I waited to review until I really tried using the book as intended. Wade makes the point that reaching the Big 6 might take 3 years or more.  I've been working it diligently for 1 year, using pretty much only this program for 2-5 days/week workouts.<br /><br />My goals: gain weight and get stronger after an intense illness. I'm 35.  I had to purchase a large foam mat and solid overhead bar to make this work - about $100 of stuff overall.  I didn't change my diet at all, other than a protein drink after most workouts.<br /><br />Starting last October, I was 6' and 147 lbs. Today, I am 169 lbs and my 32\\" pants still fit, though I have been buying 33-34 in new pants. Shirt size has gone from 15\\" to 16\\" (M to L).  I look thicker, but I do not have a puffy bodybuilder thing going on.  I feel amazingly stronger. Wife is delighted.<br /><br />I am currently on Step 6 in the 4 primary exercises (pushup, pull up, squat, leg raise).  As suggested, I have not begun the other 2 progressions.  I am a bit stuck at this point.  And bored.  I 've added some high rep stuff with weights and a heavy bag to my routine to mix things up.<br /><br />My big caveat with this is that you need a lot of patience. Other popular workout routines that I've tried deliver more impressive results much faster.  But this workout has changed my entire structure and I move more smoothly overall (stairs are easier, I dance better, etc).  Kinks in my knees and elbows that I had early on are long gone.<br /><br />I recommend the Kindle version if you can view it in color, otherwise get the print version.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Having read all of the \\"Reacher\\" books out there, to my knowledge, I would have to say that this one was not as captivating as previous reads.  I have greatly enjoyed the earlier books, and hope this is not a trend.  The story was not compelling, and the conclusion way short of \\"wow.\\"  I am an enthusiastic Amazon Kindle reader.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a very fun game I absoulutely love it I am very addicted to it and try so hard to get a high score anyone browsing the app store should certainly get this game for fun
B008D37J6O|3.0|Overall not a bad pad, but the screen just isn't bright enough even at the highest setting.  If you want to watch videos, do it in dim light or darkness.  During daylight (even indoors) it's virtually impossible.
B003I55BIA|5.0|Couldn't put it down it was so good, very exciting, would say it's for you, if you like romance, drama, etc.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought I loved Bared to You, but that pales in comparison to just how much I enjoyed Reflected in You. It. was. AMAZING. It picks up exactly where Bared to You left off.  Things are a bit strained from the party the night before, and that tension sets the tone for the rest of the book. Scorching hot love scenes abound, but also real tenderness between Gideon and Eva that tugs on those heartstrings. There's a fine line in series books like this where things could easily become annoying and overplayed, but Sylvia Day's writing flows so well, it never feels forced or unnecessarily repetitive. Gideon is still very aloof and closed off about his past, but Ms.Day gives us enough answers to be satisfying, yet still left wanting more. And boy do I want more. December 31st, get here soon!<br /><br />If you loved, or even just liked, Bared to You - you need to get this book!
B000JMKO3C|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable. This book was written with humor but also heart wrenching honesty.  I wasn't sure about the book after the first rew pages, but continued to be drawn in until I was sold and invested in all the characters.<br />I will now read all of Paulo Coelho's work.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|This is one of the  rare album's that is great from the first to the last song.  Many of them could go to number 1 hits.  This is Carrie at her best. Explosive while  being unmistakable Carrie.
B000HZEE64|5.0|This is a great movie about teamwork and respect for ones self.  It is good for people of all ages.  I think sports movies are a great way to show people how to get along and how education and respect for people are characteristics that last a lifetime.
B000W1VDEY|5.0|This album is the classic early Rush. Geddy, Alex, and Neil are absolutely geniuses on their respective instruments! With the high-pitched vocals of Geddy and the amazing instrumentalism of Alex on the guitar and Neil on the drum set with all of the percussion instruments, this is the quintessential Rush album!
B0091574VI|2.0|Educational, questionable.  Entertaining, a little.  I found it hard to believe this was not a documentary editted to look like a anthropomorphic story of the adoption of an orphan.  The story was cute but more than likely the chimp would have ended up dead without its mother. I'd like to know what Dame Jane Goodell thinks about this movie.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, I guess what some fans of the Aliens movies were disappointed that it wasn't true prequel they expected. It's a great stand alone sci-fi and does have some ties to the Alien movies universe, but you don't need to see them to enjoy this movie.
B009LZDGSI|5.0|I am so glad that finally we are moving away from reality TV and back to great scripted television shows like Elementary.  For those who love mysteries, this show will be very enjoyable and you won't be able to take your eyes off Johnny Lee Miller--he's that good!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am an avid book reader and after hearing the book mentioned on TV and by several people at work, I decided to read it. IT WAS AWFUL! I kept reading hoping it would get better but half way through the book I couldn't read any further. I enjoy romance books but this book was downright pornographic! I did not finish it and I will not read the other two. I'm disappointed that I wasted my money on such trash.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game for my son and daughter age 9 and 11.  They say the game is easy to navigate and enjoy using their creativity to build and plan their worlds.  My son has played the game on his friend's computer and says it just as good on his Kindle Fire HD.  Previously, I had read several negative reviews about the app, but we have not experienced those same problems and we've been playing about a month, now. I say \\"get it\\"!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Fantastic as usual. I love Lee Child and the Jack Reacher stories are the best. My favorite author of all time!
B008XG1X18|4.0|this app does freeze up often on my kindle fire but it is still a useful app to have for you fire
0739352962|2.0|I was originally enthusiastic about this series even though it showed a certain lack of creativity.  It's obviously a remake of the Wars of the Roses, with a country that looks like a distorted England and even down to names Stark and Lannister for York and Lancaster and \\"ser\\" instead of \\"sir\\" to designate knights. But it just drags on and on with characters trudging from one place to another with no end in sight.  I've invested many hours in this work and I wonder if Mr. Martin will die before he finishes it.
B0077ATSZE|4.0|I've wanted to watch this movie since the first time I saw it advertised. I love Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks, so I thought it had to be good. Sadly, they were barely in the movie, but I did love the segments that they were in.<br /><br />The character of Oskar was hard to like. He was rude, mean to his mom and had a potty mouth. But I did like that he would do anything possible to find out what the key was for, because he thought it was a message to him from his father. Plus, the actor who played Oskar, Thomas Horn, did a great job of portraying him.<br /><br />I loved that the mom went to such extremes to make her son's journey as smooth as possible. I loved the relationship between Oskar and his dad! And I loved how Oskar and his grandfather related to each other.<br /><br />One of the main things I didn't get was why this young boy was allowed to traipse all over New York at all hours of the day and night by himself. I just can't see that happening. Plus, during all his wanderings, the streets were mostly people-less. It's NY, and NY isn't not people-less, no matter the hour.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the man who is supposedly Oskar's grandmothers friend from her home country is really her (ex?) husband. Even when Oskar figures out who he really is, nobody comments on it. Not the grandmother, not Oskar, not the grandfather, not Oskar's mother. I can't imagine this happening in real life and nobody talking about it!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />Even though there are a few things that just didn't make any sense (to me at least), there are some amazing scenes, and that made the movie well worth watching!<br /><br />I guess the good outweighs the bad, because I'll more than likely watch this movie again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton abbey both seasons were excellent and I am looking forward to the release of the third season. The quality of the blue ray DVDs was excellent.
B0031RS4V6|4.0|This was not a typical Lee Child in that it was only a good read, not his best work, I felt it dragged a little which was unusual for a Jack Reacher novel. The story line was weaker than usual and took a little more than a stretch of the imagination to stay in the plot. Having said all that I'd stick with it and look forward to his next novel hoping it will read better.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|BEAUTIFUL COLOR, ENGLISH ACTORS I HAVE WATCHED FOR YEARS IN THE MOVIE SO I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH.  THESE ACTORS MUST HAVE NEEDED A VACATION, SO THEY DECIDED TO MAKE A MOVIE AND GET THE TRIP TO INDIA TO BOOT.  TEXAS TABBY
B009CPRZ9I|5.0|I'll admit this movie, more or less, serves as a warm up to Part 2. It clearly is something u will own once Part 2 drops. As a Prime member, I own this digitally, and it came with all of the extras!! This is what digital media should be!! ALL OF THE EXTRAS, ALL OF THE TIME!! The only down side is tht the extras play through. There are no chapters so that you can locate each individually. Amazon should work on that
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well worth the read - a fascinating story from beginning to end. I had just finished reading it when 60 Minutes aired their interview with the author.  That interview covered the highlights, but there are more details in the book.  I couldn't put it down!
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Awesome movie. Get to experience what it was like to work a german submarine in world war II.  Not the most pleasant of jobs.  The comradery that develops amongst the crew and the ability of the captain to show good leadership moves the story along nicely.  This movie will tug on your emotions and the end cannot be missed. A must addition to any library.
0316228532|1.0|After reading initially what the book was going to be about, I wouldn't have bought this book except that it's by J.K. Rowling.  I mean, she is the hottest author on the planet, why would she risk putting out a dud unless it's a sure thing? Why would her management and team of people around her allow her to put out something that wasn't an immediate success?  After 25 or so pages in, I thought, \\"Ok, this is Rowling, the story telling is great, but man, this book is NOT good.\\"  Any other author and I would have put it down.  75 pages later, I can't go any farther.  I'm finished with it, can't get through it.  Good luck to the next reader and hopefully her next book is much, MUCH better.<br /><br />A lot of comments are regarding the language in the book.  It is an adult book and I don't find language offensive at all, but it seems like it's forced to show that she knows how to swear.  It's almost like Rowling was a child TV star and needed to do the complete opposite by doing the dirtiest thing she can, which in writing is describing sex scenes and cussing.  It was way overkill discussing how the curvature of a 16 year old girl's chest looks; it just wasn't really necessary and seems like she threw it in to make it seem more \\"adult.\\"<br /><br />I didn't think I'd have to plow through a Rowling book, but it just is NOT a good read.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It is a very easy read.  I liked the book, but it was not as great as I thought it was going to be.  The ending sucked.  It was a good book- just not great.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I have never listened to any album as many times on repeat as I have for Babel.  I have waited for quite some time for Mumford and Sons' second album and Babel does not disappoint.  There is a good balance for the songs.  Babel starts off with a bang and most of the songs build up to the epic, banjo-tastic, heart-warming feeling that has come to be expected of Mumford and Sons.  Paying a little extra for the Deluxe version is worth it! Enjoy!
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is excellent.The graphics are great,and the levels are very challengeing at times.I would recommend this game to all my friends.
B00846REIS|5.0|So addicted to this series - can't wait unitl Book 3.  Eva and Giddeon struggle is ever enticing and I get drawn right into their struggle.
B00973CGXK|4.0|I have only listened to the whole album a few times, but so far I like it! Battle Born is my favorite song right now.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really enjoyed this book,good story,easy read. What amazing people we have defending us.I Highly recommend No Easy Day.[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]
B0092MKFIY|4.0|There are some great catchy tracks on here! The music is a little bit pop, a little bit rock and roll, a little bit hip-hop. Unique.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|As an insomniac I have a lot of trouble relaxing.  This program helps me get to sleep in no time.  Also the binaural product helps me relax even after the most stressful of days.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|but this app beats all the paid office-like apps on the market and it's free.  The only thing that's missing is the ability to change fonts. Other than that being the only downside, get this app if you need an office program, you'd be a fool to pay the $15 to $20 just for the same thing and a selection on fonts if you haven't already.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Kept reading, thinking it would get better. It didn't. How in the world did this make the new York Times bestseller list?
B007TBZ63Y|1.0|Our book also crashed the kindle fire at chapter 25 page 4.  Will the publisher fix the problem and resend the book to each person that previously purchased the book? Or do we have to contact amazon?
B005N7CA3A|5.0|This is such an intensely beautiful album...I literally can't stop listening to it. Darren's voice is gorgeous and the lyrics he writes are so poetic. One of my favorite cds of all time! Fans of his earlier work with Savage Garden will appreciate it for sure :)
B009CPEOC4|5.0|It was sad seeing her cry at the end, she was such a trooper though! So yes I ama katy perry fan
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This was a wonderful book. I was fascinated by the three main characters and the use of time. Very relate able.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Best ever!!!!! I could not put this one down. I was still reading at 4 in the morning! I had such a strong reaction to this book. It pulled on my heart. Do not miss this series!!! I can't wait for December,  never thought I would wish for Christmas to hurry along, lol.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Let me first say that a movie for me has to be interesting enough for me to engage and forget about life for a while.  Many of the films I like are not given much attention by the critics.  The story line is one we have seen dozens of times.  Bad boy makes good and gets the girl.  Aliens attack the earth and for all their superiority run into man's dogged resistence combined with an Achillies heel fall flat in world domination.  I loved the ending which is a great tribute to a superior generation.  All in all I was entertained, a good use of my $3.99.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|Riveting movie about greed, hope, self reliance and more. Paul Thomas Anderson is a brilliant director. Casting for the flick is superb. The kind of movie that leaves you thinking abut it and what it is about for many days afterward.
B0058PJ6NE|3.0|the app work good some times do not  download  the  video as  its suppose to do, but 75% time  work fine
B00976NY6A|4.0|There are better in depth reviews on here, so i'll just say overall its a solid album, with a few forgettable tracks mixed in. Definitely a worthy purchase for fans of the band or genre. I'd probably say its closer to 3 1/2 stars than 4, but I can't pick 3 1/2. Favorite songs: Flesh & Bone, Runaways, A Matter of Time, Miss Atomic Bomb, The Rising Tide, Battle Born
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is a great app. Mobisystems.com is a great developer and will give you great customer service which you will need if you purchase from Amazon.<br /><br />This version listed as 6.5.968 once installed will install as version 6.1.861 if you check the about tab after installing.<br /><br />Last week my version was 6.5.9?? (Sorry don't remember fully.) Amazon notified me of an upgrade. It was listed as version 6.1.861.<br /><br />So it seems like they typed over the version description in the advertising from 6.1.861 to 6.5.968, but it still installs as 6.1.861 when you check the about tab.<br /><br />Buy this product, it is great. Buy it somewhere else.<br /><br />Update: Oct 07 2012 Several hours after the review above I received another update listed as 6.5.968 after installing I checked the about tab and it listed the version as listed as 6.5.968. Who knows if the actual program is correct. For now Amazon Store has it right.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|one of my favorite games in the arcade, and this is a fun simulation. easy to understand and play. extra words
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I've read ALL the books out there with Jack Reacher as a character.  A Wanted Man ranks up there with the best.
B0071T4BVC|3.0|A good departure from the usual stuff for McCartney but after awhile all the songs started to sound a bit alike.
B008RTE066|5.0|I received my set today...upon opening the box the first thing I see is my very own Ticket for the Magical Mystery Tour. The 10 x 10 book has a nice forward by Sir Paul..followed by a Beatles time period piece by Barry Miles. The Book concludes with a \\"Diary of the Tour\\" with many many pictures and copies of invoices from the filming. Then there is a 7 x 7 gatefold holding both the Blu-Ray and DVD. Then finally the 7 x 7 Magical Mystery Tour EP made in the USA!!!! A gorgeous Gatefold replication. Yes the one record Capitol refused to release in the US, but instead adding singles tracks to create a full album. Yes the disc labels are replications of the UK release but have \\"Made In The USA\\"!!!! So Roll Up for the Mystery Tour!!!!!
B0088WK27S|5.0|very nice movie, it was inspirational and entertaining. Make you feel as though you don't have it as bad as most people in the world.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Just one more block. Just one more block. Are the words you'll be hearing. Even has wifi play so you can mine with others on different devices.
B00933U1EU|4.0|A great start. Let's hope it keeps up.  The acting is superb.  Specially Claire Danes as a string out (possibly insane) CIA type.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Loved season 5 - the new office, Don's new apartment and wife, a lot of great story lines!  Could have used more Betty, but otherwise, excellent.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|From start to finish this movie is inspiring.  Denzel is perfect and the story is even better.  You can't go wrong with a movie about faith in the darkest of times.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Had not read a John Grisham book in a few years but after reading \\"The Litigators\\" I realized what I enjoyed about this work, that is, it is well paced, good character development and the story does draw you in. I hate to use cliches but here it is: It was a page turner!!  I will read more of his work in the furure.
B009ARMS1I|5.0|This season of Glee looks to be better than ever. I am glad that the new Rachael is Blaine. He is so good looking and is really nice. Every one who is a Gleek will be watching to see what happens next.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I did enjoy this book. It was a great read, but I'm not sure it is a factual as we were lead to believe.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The interconnectivity of Evernote makes it one of the first apps I get on any device. Cell phone, tablet, Pc... all flawlessly integrated!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|We had a wonderful time playing this game. It was fun, challenging W and a bit creepy. Highly recommended! We can't wait to play the next one.
B000FBFN1U|2.0|I am an avid reader of genre fiction, literature, criticism and sometimes abstract non-fiction, and was pre-disposed to enjoy George RR. Martin's Storm of Swords, having become enamored of HBO's production Game of Thrones. But I find the prose very slow going. Martin excels at plot, and nearly every sentence in the opening 50 pages, at least, suggests multiple plot lines, so many that as a reader I find iti difficult to a) keep track of them all and b) determine which ones are significant, which are throw-aways. The density does not seem to let up in order to let my mind breathe and take in what's just been said. Every paragraph is a thicket.<br /><br />I have not read the previous books, but due to the tv show I recognize the characters. Characterization may be Martin's weak point as a writer; he can draw a distinctive character quickly, but they don't yet feel to me as if they acquire much substance, except through their actions, which it seems to me the author is pushing forward like a computer games player moving avatars around. Maybe if I get further in this book I will feel that the individuals who make up this multitude do indeed \\"live\\" on the page. The density of incident and anticipated incident, however, is wearing me down. The density does not equal intensity -- I feel little drive here, though the multiple plots offer plenty of intrigue. Unlike in the tv show, where the cross editing between subplots is relentless but makes for suspense, I am not on edge here, or inspired to keep reading. That is a failing in any book, and I'm disappointed that it's my reaction to this one.
B008XG1X18|4.0|it does force close often but when it does open I love it. I like the layout of the bulletin boards. Easy to find.  Maggie.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I've read all his books, but this one just didn't work for me. Seemed a little depressing. I had to struggle to finish it.
B0095T3H2U|5.0|I am a big fan of Jason Segal.  Some hilarious hunting scenes.  I would recommend for a good laugh and an easy watch.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was reading this book during the attack On Libya 2012. I could just imagine what our SEALS sacrifice for our country day in and day out, I couldn't put this book down it was just that good.  Our SEALS got Osama not Obama and everyone should understand that. Thank you to our military for all that you do!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|this game has wonderful graphics...also fun to play....challenging...takes some time to play...cant wait to play the second one...keep games like this coming...
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Loved it! Reccommend! This was well worth the cost. Great graphics and puzzles. I played it over a week so it was just challenging enough!
B000FC130E|4.0|If I have to write a review about every Gaiman book I like, I'll become a writer myself. \\"Neverwhere\\" is such a nice, page-turner story! Sometimes I feel like NG could make a good story out of an empty tax form. This book, though, didn't hit me as wonderfully as \\"American Gods\\" (and that might be the only reason why I gave it four stars), but the mastery for creating new worlds and compelling characters is right there. Please don't stop writing, Mr. Gaiman.
B00846REIS|4.0|Plot was similar to 50 Shades. Even still, it was a fun, mindless and steamy read. I'll buy the next book in the series.
B007TML4EI|4.0|The game is interesting and has great physics.  They let you think you are a great builder and then throw in wrenches where you have to defend one dummy and destroy the other.  It does start to get really challenging and I will continue to play this for months to come.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I am a teenager, but it is still fun. Since it is suppose to be a kids game it is dumb because you have to buy money for this game, or it is really hard, so yeah, fun game, but they shouldn't expect kids to spend money.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love mahjong so this is a great app for me.  The colors and graphics. Are beautiful.  The large amount. Of layouts will give you many games to choose from.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|How does this guy keep doing it?  Great album.  Amazing ballads and lyrics that don't miss.  This guy just keeps on delivering.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm  almost finished reading the 1st book and keep waiting for something believable to happen. Story line is Too unlikely to be real but it's entertaining enough.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child's is one of three authors who has never disappointed me. Jack Reacher book delivers kickass action with old west sensibilities.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|cant stop playing this cute game!! made it.to level 109 and then my.old.Kindle died. starting all over on my new one now
B0049J3QF4|5.0|We initially purchased CARS for my 5 year old grandson since he LOVES cars, trucks, planes, etc.  Once he started watching the movie we were all drawn into the story and watched the entire movie.  It's a simple enough story for young children but it also contains lots of grown up humor too.  Fun movie for the entire family.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book helped a lot. I will recommend it to everyone. Will definitely read this book again and again.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I ordered this from a New & Used offer since it was a replacement, and WOW! It was nearly overnighted to me. It was shipped October 4th and came October 6th in a bubble wrapped envelope. Very pleased with shipping.<br />The album itself is a masterpiece. It's truly magical. Florence's lyrics are dark and gorgeous. Her voice has such a large range and it can soar up and then fly back down in an instant.<br />This is best illustrated in the track Girl With One Eye.<br />It begins very softly, and then towards the bridge, her voice soars and she belts out the final chorus.<br />The instrumentation isn't as recognized, but it's equally as impressive. So many instruments, hut they don't overwhelm Florence's voice. Florence's voice does overwhelm the instruments though.<br />So, yes, 5 out of 5 for the album<br />5 out of 5 for the shipping
B003Z2LAAO|2.0|I saw this in the Imax theater when it was first released....  a lot of people walked out in the first fifteen minutes....  It was loud, and mainly pop music which seem to get louder during the action scenes. The film would have stood on its own without the pop music, yet I suppose the producers decided it needed more \\"flash\\".  The title should have been \\"Adventures on the Colorado River\\" as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is reallllllly addicting :) its fun to play in class or at work or at 3 in the mornig when im bored.
B001MSMULG|5.0|I'm a fan of spy novels in general, and other reviewers are right, Daniel Silva is the heir apparent to John LeCarre.  In fact - dare I say it? - I prefer Silva. Silva's writing meanders less than LeCarre's and Silva gets to the point faster without throwing style overboard.  It's nice to read a spy novelist who's returned to the European theatre, and with a brooding, cultured protagonist -- which is what we get with the character Allon.  The subsequent books in the Allon series are also very good, but you should start with this one if possible.
B00932A2MC|5.0|If you are looking for an action filled escape, this is the movie.  I didn't have much of an expectation prior to watching... but after watching I was blown away. A good human story, lots of special effects... and the good guys, uh... well watch it you will see!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I'm an old school platform gamer ( 50 yrs. young) and will shamelessly admit to playing this on my Fire until my battery dies.  Each level and world are so visually appealing that I wish there was a way to 'view ' them minus the play.  The graphics are that superior and the characters cute and engaging but would appeal to all ages.  Ubisoft has done it again - hats off to you!<br /><br />It plays well on my Fire with smooth gameplay.  A wee bit of a learning curve to get the jumps, etc down but it could just be my 'age.'  Music is cute at first but one can always toggle so no big.  Still not real clear on the save /change option but again.....the age thing (?)  When done with this game I will be searching for the earlier Rayman games and hope they'll work on my Fire.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Story was slow moving until the end. I couldn't understand the purpose of the many instances of counting the number of words in a sentence, the \\"math problems\\" Jack was doing in his head, etc. Hope our hero isn't becoming OCD. While I'm writing...Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher??? Since height is not a requirement for the part of Reacher, why not Danny DeVito? At least Devito is funny. Hope the next Reacher novel brings back the real Reacher. And, as a personal note, I hope the book is not in the first person.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Pink does it again! Great songs full of truth and emotion!  It's gritty and tender all wrapped together. Pink never disappoints! LOVE IT!
B000W178XO|5.0|An amazing album! Thoroughly enjoyable from all walks of life. Some of his best tracks are all available in this two disc (MP3) collection. Well worth it
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Lee Child never disappoints and in 'A Wanted Man' the action is relentless, the plot complex and the characters not always who they seem to be.  The biggest problem is that it all ends too quickly, as you can't stop reading in order to solve the multi-layered puzzle that Reacher finds himself embroiled in!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The only downsides to this book is that it is very long and maybe too many stories. But the author pulls then all together nicely and has a way of keeping your interest peaked. I don't know how accurate the historical facts are, but they seem very plausable.
B005CRQ2IU|4.0|When I first got my latest Kindle, I found there was a recent update and that comics were among the features added. I hit the store in search, as I had long thought the device would be a great fit. Amazon did it, I nabbed a sample, waited a bit, and once it opened and I skimmed I was in love.<br /><br />The Watchmen has many reviews for the physical copy, as such I recommend you look to those for information on the story. I'm much more focused on how it transitioned from print to digital.<br /><br />Visually, it looks good. Not quite as impressive in many regards, in part due to color but mainly due to the smaller screen. While navigating through the comic it has an autoflow, which lets you hit the next button to first see the full page, then zoom to the first panel and work through them progressively. Large panels were nicely split, and so were generally very easy to enjoy.<br /><br />My one complaint, is how the pages of text were broken apart. They weren't as clear as the rest, and so often stood out in memory as being too difficult to even want to read. So, having often found I wanted to put the comic down due to it, I feel 4 stars is generous.<br /><br />Still, for the most part it was quite enjoyable. And that it's now on my Kindle means I can always contemplate who is watching the watchmen while out and about.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|Off and on, I've had challenges with ergonomics for several years. In this case, I've owned two different ergonomic 'vertical' mice. The first one I liked a lot, but unfortunately it wasn't very durable and the cord actually wore out quickly.<br /><br />The Evoluent however, is top-notch. It's super-comfortable and feels natural to hold. The buttons are positioned perfectly with the right size, and the scroll-wheel is just right. I particularly appreciate that this comes in multiple sizes, so I was able to get the small one.<br /><br />Lastly, I appreciate that this mouse is durable. I've literally dropped it several times on the floor, and every time it's continued to work just fine... much to my surprise. Even though I try not to drop it, I've finally stopped freaking out and worrying each time I do. Now I just shrug and pick it back up knowing it'll keep working just fine.<br /><br />UPDATE 07/15/2015: It's now over 4 years since I bought this mouse, and a while since I wrote my previous review. Everything I wrote is still true... including it surviving even MORE drops. Also, I travel with this mouse and bring it with me when I work at cafes. People ask me all the time about it, and occasionally even are delighted to share that they own (and love) their Evoluent mouse too.
B000FC21PA|5.0|This is a great book for those who believe in themselves for finding truth, for finding meaning in life. How the protagonist (Siddhartha) goes from one type of life to another and comes back full circle in the end to find meaning in whatever he is doing... is very refreshing and inspiring.
1454701250|5.0|I just received the book, and am already thrilled with it. I am totally familiar with Gennine's artwork, but her stamping art is new to me.<br />For anyone who has been thinking about trying stamp carving ,go for it! I have carved some and enjoyed it in the past but now I am certainly going to do more. A really beautiful book, with tons of unique ideas. find her blog on line , and discover a delightful artist who is willing to share her talent and techniques.  P.S. the carving process is not hard to do.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Get passed the sex, which is difficult since it's on every other page, and it's a poorly written, poorly constructed story.
B002ONV5E6|4.0|We really enjoyed watching all the movies in preparation to the last one, they all are as good as when we went to the movies
B00973CGXK|5.0|Best Killers Album since Sam's Town. Love the emotion and energy of Justin Flowers and the band! Favorite tracks are Miss Atomic Bomb and From Here on Out
B000HF0ISC|5.0|PITT AND DENIRO GREAT, A LITTLE LONG BUT A GREAT STORY AND DRAMA,  IS REVENGE JUSTICE OR JUSTICE REVENGE. WHAT IS REALLY THE MORAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PRIEST
B009AJDDQU|5.0|Pretty good movie. Great special effects. Nice story telling the origins of Aliens and how man came about. It left a nice opening for another movie.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Very fun. Game levels very enough to keep it entertaining. Only problem is the timing is off so that some of the levels are impossible.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Surprising twists and sharp turns! Excellent suspenseful read!  Wish ending was more elaborate , but that's just my preference. Loved it!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Make you day...download this fun loving song that we all will relate to.  Smile, laugh, dance on the floor or in your head.  Up beat and happy.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|Being a big fan of fairy tales and the age-old and allegorical red riding hood story in particular, I was excited when this movie came out, but all the negative reviews put me off and I never actually watched it until tonight on cable. And I was mesmerized! The story is a creative take on the legend, and the music and cinematography are so lush and sensual that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Amanda Seyfried is beautiful beyond words, and the last 15 minutes of the movie are as suspenseful and surprising as any Hitchcock film. I don't understand all the negative reaction to this movie - to me, it is perhaps the most brilliant depiction of a fairy tale as has ever been done.
B007MG360G|4.0|This game is a really good game I love it! But if it asks you for the upgrade it stays like that until you get the upgrade! But other wise then that it is a very good game I give it a 4* This is as good as the Weeds my water app!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Slow paced at the start, but well written and picks up the pace after 100 pages.  A good character and fascinating plot. Bosch is so flawed and angst-filled he becomes lovable!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|as i am completely new to publishing on the kindle direct puclishing, i found this a bit overwhelming, although i have complete confidence that step by step, this is the way to do it. I shall.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book is exactly as described. If you go into it knowing that it's an auto biography and not a SEAL manual, then it's awesome. If course it will be ego filled pages, it's an auto biography! Someone wanted him to write it, about himself, and people bought it. I would buy it again and u suggest reading it. As a current soldier, rich does mean Army, I thought he did a good job of explaining things that I know but aren't obvious to most people. A good read.
034580404X|3.0|I wanted to see why the trilogy stayed at the top of the NY Times best Seller list for months. I found them a different type of literature than I usually read,but interesting toward the shocking genre and a fast read.I'd reccommend them to those who are of an open mind!-not for everyone-very adult!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found this book very informing. These guys worked hard to get it right. Great re-telling of a life of those who go into harms way
B0057A6GA6|4.0|I play it when I'm waiting....and it's hard to put it down.<br />I go back to it with a new concept to beat it.<br /><br />Each level has new challenges
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A compelling read about the men who took out Osama Bin Laden.  There are no heroic charges or intense firefights.  But this is a gripping narrative of the men and women who hunted and killed the worlds most wanted terrorist.<br /><br />The actual details of the mission read like a Hollywood script.  But the book also gives the background of these elite warriors.  The author doesn't brag or gloat.  He tells the story with the straight forward style of someone who has done dangerous things on numerous occasions.<br /><br />It is a book that you will read to its conclusion shortly after starting it.<br /><br />God bless the men and women of our armed forces and all those who fight with us in the war on terror.  This book tells their story.
B009G8GRX6|1.0|to simply say \\"muse goes dubstep\\" should be enough to turn off most listeners who have been around since the early albums, but there is much more than dubstep experimentation going on here. It seems that Matt Bellamy decided to take every thing that people complained about on The Resistance (which I thought was a decent album), and pump all of that up by tenfold. So what we get is synths on top of synths on top of falsetto with more synths and the occasional electric guitar that is modulated to the point where it doesn't sound like guitar anymore. If you want heavy rock, look elsewhere, this album is all glitter and computerized goofiness - anyone who tells you that this is a band that still takes itself seriously hasn't heard Origin of Symmetry or Absolution. By the time it even gets to that awful dubstep song towards the end of the album, you will have probably already decided to sell it back to amazon. The single \\"Madness\\" is catchy enough, but everything else feels like a bad remix of the last two albums. Really, truly awful stuff. Sad day for a hard-core Muse fan.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved every book! All were entertaining, suspenceful and so very sad;( I really liked how the books made it seem like it was taken place a long time ago but then certain things are explained or happens and you remember it's in the future. To me the best and worst part of the book is that you forget that all the horrible stuff happening is happening to KIDS!!;/ really good books you won't be disappointed ;)
B003YL4L0W|2.0|I think this book covers many of today's \\"hot button\\" issues: infertility treatment, divorce, alcoholism, homosexuality, same-sex marriage, evangelical Christianity, the disposal of frozen embryos. I think the writing was rather pedantic. The use of language was not very inventive. If you want to write a book that will sell well to the Wal-Mart shoppers, this is the book to write.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Entertaining.  Same fun and frustration as the real thing without the drain on the wallet!  Excellent graphics.  Intuitive game play.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|I was expecting a mediocre movie on Marilyn, but got a great walk down memory lane from my youth.  This movie did her justice and was an enjoyable couple of hours on a plane ride.  Well done.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|I didn't read all of the Kurt Wallander stories in chronological order and it is my understanding that they weren't even translated into English in the proper order but no matter, any one of them is incredible.  It is my opinion that this is the best of them all so far but I have only read five of them.  This one seems like it takes Kurt Wallander to the finality of his career but it does it in a way that made me feel like it was closer to a biography than fiction.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lots of twist and turns - Reacher stiches clues endlessly and accurately.<br />He is tough and thorough. Way ahead of the locals and pros. Plot is a little weak but unique.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I really like this game! It is super fun but some of the levels are hard. It is very challenging and well worth the money.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have now completed the trilogy of 50 Shades of Grey and must say that I enjoyed this trilogy more than any other I have come across.  It defies logic and teaches the reader that love can still exist and that those once in a lifetime episodes can carry through for a lifetime.  That is, if you believe!  An enjoyable read!  I look forward to reading more from this author.
0783229526|1.0|I bought this DVD from Amazon for my sons birthday and when he tried to play the DVD it would not work as it said it did not recognise the region. It was very disappointing and it was not mentioned when I purchased the DVD that it would not play in Australia. Very frustrated and annoyed with Amazon, wont be purchasing from them again, waste of hard earned money. It would not be worth returning the DVD as the postage would cost more than the cost of the DVD.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Definitely a must-see. Paul Newman is amazing as always, and it's fun to see so many people who ended up being famous later on.
B000002ITM|4.0|Alex Skolnick's last album until \\"The Formation of Damnation\\" and undeniably his best performance with this band. His ethereal, monumental building solo in Return To Serenity still stuns me after 100 listens, and is unquestionably one of the finest solos in the genre. Also his smooth bluesy lines in \\"Electric Crown\\" and eerie jaw-dropping work in So Many Lies and the title track (the latter which includes seriously awesome jazz phrasing) is stunning. I've heard him in recent albums but unfortunately the man seems stuck in autopilot shred mode and doesn't utilize his more interesting influences (he did after all attend Guiliard, play free form jazz, and plays in the Trans Siberian Orchestra). This is the last album he made before leaving Testament, probably feeling they limited his style too much. And his ability to push the limits of metal guitar work to extreme technical and creative limits is shown at his finest here. In fact, I'd argue he's second only Marty Friedman of Megadeth fame (another man who left his mark on metal by using a wide variety of influences in his guitar work).<br /><br />Most of the songs here are good; the overall songwriting is the best the band had since \\"The New Order\\". To all the haters, despite clearly not being thrash, this record is much less commercial than the black album. It also contains some of the bands most creative songs, like the morbid, creepy title track , and the awesome ballad Return to Serenity. Electric Crown the lead off single is one of the band's catchiest songs ever, and I've always like the crunchy song \\"Deadline\\" which has a very catchy chorus and two excellent winding solos from Mr. Skolnick. The weird eerie atmosphere found in the title track is also used to great effect in the tracks \\"So Many Lies\\" and \\"As The Seasons Gray.\\" Elsewhere, some filler can be found, but the best moments on this CD are among the band's best and Alex Skolnick is at his absolute pinnacle here, and the LP is worth hearing for him alone.<br /><br />I'm seeing this band live tomorrow, and am disappointed they ignore this album entirely.<br /><br />Alex Skolnick fans should also be encouraged to check out \\"Trans-Siberian Orchestra\\" next time they're touring near you, they're awesome as well.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|I think this was a very boring movie.I would not recommend it to anyone.No plot or interesting parts to the movie.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This work was by far the best fantasy read I've had since \\"The Name of the Wind\\" by Rothfuss.  Anthony Ryan seemed to take a page from Rothfuss actually, as the majority of this book is told from the protagonist's point of view to someone writing his story.<br /><br />I was a huge fan of Al Sorna from the very beginning.  I found myself literally cheering for him while I was reading.  Ryan does a great job developing Al Sorna into a protagonist worth rooting for, someone who doesn't take the easy way out, puts everything into his decisions, and continually stands by his convictions.<br /><br />The plot is epic, with action, intrigue, and cold calculation throughout.  Ryan's take on magic was different and something that I can't wait to be further explored in the coming novels.<br /><br />Overall, killer read.  I'm anxiously awaiting the follow up novel!
B009AMAKSQ|5.0|The movie is incredible and go reach everything important from the book. 5 stars easely! Everyone must to see that movie!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed wrote a wonderful story depicting her emotional roller coaster as she prepared for and walked a large portion of the Pacific Crest Trail.  Her descriptions of the terrain, people she met and the thoughts that went through her mind made this a fascinating story.
B005LAII8A|3.0|Everything feels derivative about \\"Looper,\\" whom clueless critics have been lauding as a sci-fi time-traveling mind-bending puzzle.  The visuals -- the mob-run bankrupt city and the contrasting cleanness of the countryside -- seem a diluted version of the rich, overflowing cinematography of \\"Minority Report.\\"  The plot a lesser version of the grandeur and scale of the Terminator series.  And for any serious sci-fi or fantasy reader who's been spoiled by the rich varied tapestry of Isaac Asimov or George Martin novels \\"Looper\\" feels lame and sophomoric, bloated and bombastic.<br /><br />I also seriously question the casting of Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the main role.  He just doesn't have the charisma to be a leading man, and his make-up just makes him look ridiculous.  And how could anyone watch him and think he's a younger version of Bruce Willis?  Bruce who's taller and sturdier and bigger than his younger version seems more like a transplant from \\"Die Hard\\" than from the future.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Looper\\" is a failure of the imagination and of film-making.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Some reviewers complain that this book starts slow.  It's true that there's a lot of setup before the story gets going, but I don't think it's wasted.  The story itself is complicated, and the characters lives are as complicated as the modern tech-heavy world in which they live. So I personally didn't mind the author spending some time explaining things, and once it takes off it really rocks.<br /><br />There's a lot of specific detail in the book about things, people, places, technology, events.  Sometimes the detail seems overwhelming and I found myself wondering how the book became so popular.  Do readers really like all that detail?  I don't know the answer but you don't necessarily need to absorb every sentence that is offered.  I mean if you don't care how a hacker can completely take over someone's computer you can skim that part and still enjoy the story.  Maybe some readers need that sense of realism.<br /><br />The main female character, Lisbeth Salander, is by far the most interesting person in the story.  I'm imagining that the author had a message in mind when he created a story where a counter-culture, anti-social, skinny misfit of a woman makes it possible for an incredibly complex riddle to be solved but gets little credit in the end.  When you discover some of the other themes in the story you might agree.  He seems to want to champion the cause of women who have not gotten the best treatment in society.  By the way, some of the gutsy stunts she pulls off are amazing.<br /><br />The plot keeps unfolding until the end.  Just when you think you know what's going on there's another layer to unravel.<br /><br />I'll probably read the next one.
0060899220|4.0|\\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is less a memoir, and more a collection of Anthony Bourdain's essays, thoughts, and meditations on the restaurant kitchen, and what it means for those who work in it and for those who are fed by it.  The first few pieces in this 307-page book are hilarious to read, and perhaps some stories -- especially the one about how when as a lowly busboy/runner Bourdain peeked at the chef banging a bride on her wedding day it was his divine inspiration to become a chef -- are too good to be true, and seem if not fabricated then exaggerated.<br /><br />There's a section where Bourdain provides useful advice for restaurant eaters.  Never order fish on a Monday, and never order a steak well-done.  Don't try the buffets or the specials because they're just recycled food.  Actually, what's best is if you don't eat at a restaurant at all because you never know who has touched your food, and where they have put your food  (the thought of criminal, decrepit, and slightly insane chefs banging waitresses on bags of flour will make you think twice about eating pizza and bread at a restaurant again).<br /><br />There are some entertaining moments in this book, and there are some useful advice.  But really it's too much information, and it seems all haphazardly assembled together so that this book feels like a 1,000 pages rather than 307 pages.  Bourdain of all people should know that a good book should be like a good meal.  Yes, you want intense flavor, brilliant colors, and rich variety in the meal, but there ought to be a consistency and compatibility from the appetizer to the desert.  A good meal is ultimately a good story, and you permit flavors, ideas, and plot-lines to build as you entice the reader throughout.<br /><br />As it stands, this book is less the work of a chef at a two-star Michelin restaurant, and more like that of an all-you-can-eat buffet place.  There are some real gems in here, but there's also a lot of gratuitous chapters put in just so Bourdain can deliver a manuscript without much effort and the publisher can sell books.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I've been wondering what the delay was. I've checked every few days to see if the book was downloaded and saved the latest bill from my credit card company to call you, but haven't had time to do that. PLEASE download this book to my I Pad ASAP.  I would love to be able to give you al review of the book.<br /><br />Thank you.

B0098VXE50|4.0|I found this to be an excellent action/adventure/fantasy movie.  This version of the classic Snow White tale was well done with fantastic special effects, a great story line, and wonderful acting.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I found the ending to be somewhat of a letdown, albeit the logical place to end the story.  The ending just lacked the vibrancy of the rest of the film.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This book has definitely helped me tie it all together.  He uses a full circle method of marketing to maximize his sales and profits.  John Locke has thought of it all.  Most of all I think he nailed it by having more than one book because readers who like your books tend to want to buy other books you've written.  Build your following.  Great book.  I wrote my first book on Forex Breakout Trading and I wish I had released at least 2 or 3 good books at one time.  Oh well.  Still plenty of time.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel<br />Book: 2<br />By Sylvia day<br /><br />I probably going to be in the minority on this one, but it felt like book two wasn't written by Sylvia in the same way as book one (over editing?)  My hopes were high and I certainly loved Book one, but Eva and Gideon's roller coaster ride of a relationship was frustrating, instead over both characters gradually moving forward.<br />Eva started out as a strong women character (yes, who had her issues) but turned into a weak woman (Well,  till the very end)  So many times, I wanted her to walk away from Gideon, which was most likely NOT the writers intent.  I don't even feel a lot of connection with his character. Without some sort of growth on his part he took a step backwards instead of forward in Book two. . Example:  The scene where he's coming out of the shower in his office, What woman would stand for no explanation, (I would have thrown that ring so fast)  I wanted to shake her silly! I can only hope Book 3 will give me the progress  I was hoping to see in book 2, Of course, I will read Book Three, who wouldn't after this much commitment.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|Great story line great choreographed martial arts moves and great acting. Overall it's a 5 star action film. I would recomend this film to anyone who loves action films.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|First, a plug for Amazon Prime.  I ordered two of these mics yesterday afternoon for two-day delivery with free Amazon Prime shipping.  They arrived in one day instead of two.  I don't expect I'll always get this level of service, but since it actually happened, I want to recognize it.  Thank you, Amazon.<br /><br />Second, unlike the picture of the ATR3350 on Amazon.com and unlike at least one of the reviewers, the mics I received have a stereo TRS plug.  I was prepared to have to convert the audio from mono to stereo in post, but I'm not going to have to do that.  I almost chose different mics because of this.  After reading a bit deeper on the Audio-Technica website, this is a change I think they made in late 2011 or early 2012.  It's still a mono mic; it just has a stereo plug and provides the signal to both channels.<br /><br />Before buying, I read and watched several reviews of the ATR3350, especially when used with the Olympus LS-10 audio recorder.  The general impression I received from the reviews was that the LS-10 builtin mics were significantly better than the ATR3350.  I purchased the ATR3350 anyway, because I wanted a lav alternative to the LS-10 in front of someone's face for video.  And I figured for $20, it was worth taking a chance.  After doing some of my own testing, I would say that the LS-10 mics are better, but the ATR3350 certainly yields decent audio that well exceeded my medium low expectations.<br /><br />Compared to the LS-10 mics, the ATR3350 returns more low-frequency noise, and it also needs more gain.  I tried turning on the LS-10's \\"low cut\\" filter.  This cut out the noise, but also makes voice recording sound too thin.  I think I'll just deal with the low-frequency noise in post.  With the LS-10 \\"mic sense\\" set to low, the ATR3350 was barely loud enough even with the recording level gain set to max.  I set the LS-10's \\"mic sense\\" setting to high, and turned down the recording level gain, and this seemed to be a better way to configure things.<br /><br />In short, the purchase looks like a good one.  A powered mic, long cable, stereo plug, windscreen--features that are hard to find all together, and available for about $20--this seems like a good deal.  I'll know more after processing my next video shoot.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he loved it!  It inspired a non-reader to start reading the books. Can't wait for Season 2.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This wasn't as quick of a read as the first two, in fact I am about 3/4 of the way through. I found that it dragged on a bit and I lost interest; but the trilogy in general was well worth the read. No, these two weren't like anyone you'd ever know (or want to know) in real life, but they were still interesting reading. I know this story was floating around online for awhile. Why didn't James fix some of the editing and other problems before this book was published?<br /><br />Wondering what will happen with book four.....
B000G6R7B8|4.0|It's been years since I've had a gadget free watch and love it!<br /><br />After I had cracked the crystal on my \\"high-dollar\\" watch, I decided to purchase this Seiko as a disposable replacement. I work in a harsh desert environment and liked the sand colored theme and old school military appearance. It has an intuitive method for changing the date and time. I change time zones periodically, but I don't do it enough to remember a complicated 5 step, 3 button combination to do that most basic of watch functions.<br /><br />Time keeping seems to be accurate and I haven't had to adjust the time for the past month that I have been using it. I wear it everyday and so the self-winding function has been working like a champ.<br /><br />The reason for only 4 out of 5 stars in my case, is that the crystal is flat, making it mirror-like in its reflectivity. I am considering purchasing some sort of phone screen protector with a low reflectance to mitigate this problem.

There is no 5.1 sound on either of the disks in this set. Both disks here are strictly stereo. A 5.1 version of \\"Document\\" was released in 2005. As for this stereo issue, it sounds excellent - both the concert and the studio album.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The third book of the trilogy.  Book contained undying love, kinky sex, suspense and drama.  A great read for mature readers.
B005FISBV2|5.0|** it is worth noting based on other reviews, I bought my copy in Australia and did not have any adds at beginning of each disk nor a spoiler showing the ending to the season **<br /><br />Season four with Trinity and the death of Rita in the final scenes was gripping and high quality TV and set up what should have been an even better season five, but five turned out to be a big dissapointment.<br />But season six is right back on track and in my opinion the best season yet, at first it is a little daunting considdering the time gap between seasons 5 and 6, alot has changed between but when you considder this show is a 12 episode season and there are 52 weeks in a year and season 4 and 5 were continueous it makes sense to advance forward, do we really expect to be waiting 40 weeks between seasons and have everything exactly the same?<br /><br />Between seasons dexter has found his balance between being a father and also feeding his dark passanger so is in some fine form<br />The main storyline of the season is the Doomsday killers and their murders based on the book of revolation and overall the whole season has strong religious undertones but not in a way that its forcing it down our throats nor being disrespectful to those who are religious, and the way Dexter disects his own thoughts and feelings and questions the merit of religion is intriguing and entertaining.<br /><br />The doomsday killings are gory yet artistic and very twisted and for me a real highlight for the season, to be living in a city where these types of killings were happening would truely be terrifying.<br /><br />There are some great twist and turns in this season, if you like your tv to be predictable maybe this season is not for you. and the season ending cliff hanger is truelly a holly s#@t! moment and leaves you desperately wanting to get straight into season 7<br /><br />As far as the other charactor development goes everyone seems to move forward, Angel and Quin make an interesting and highly entertaining partnership especially with both dealing with major personal set backs and their behavior is certainly not professional, especially Quin who goes completely off the rails.<br />Debra struggles with her new found responsibility especially having to deal with more politics while having to take a backseat to investigating where she is at home.<br /><br />Not only is this the best dexter season yet but it sets up the coming final 2 seasons of Dexter perfectly and i for one am looking forward to the wild rideghly entertaining partnership especially with both dealing with major personal set backs and their behavior is certainly not professional, especially Quin who goes completely off the rails.<br />Debra struggles with her new found responsibility especially having to deal with more politics while having to take a backseat to investigating where she is at home.<br /><br />Not only is this the best dexter season yet but it sets up the coming final 2 seasons of Dexter perfectly and i for one am looking forward to the wild ride
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I at first did NOT want to read the Twilight books but after all of my friends started reading it and sayin how much they liked it I bought the Twilight four pack and after about 2400 pages I realised that I WAS right. This book sucked. At first I delt with the fact that in New Moon Bella was so.... anoying!! She was acting almost clingy with Edward (Why would such a hottie as described be called EDWARD??) And what REALY ticked me off was in the last book. Wedding- of course it was &#34;perfect&#34; and Stephanie kept going on and on about how Bellas dress was perfect but all that was said was that it was satin. REALY!?!?!?. and I personally always liked Jacob better and ive read some REALY bad books and those are better than this. And the fact that Bella was pregate ticked me off. I MEANBELLA WAS FREAKIN DEAD AFTER SHE GAVE BIRTH TO RENESME!!!!! Oh and at the end there wasnt even a vamp fight after they gathered all the vampire covens. and Aro was SCARED of Bella. I mean WTH!?!? At the end bella doesnt loose anything shes just again the perfect lrincess who EVERYONE likes. After I read this I was ready to email some not very nice words to mrs. stephanie. again a waste of money dont buy.
B007FG9LIE|1.0|This book, from beginning to end, made very little sense.  The main character was without any likable traits.  Do not waste any time or money on this book.

B008G12ERC|5.0|*Not your expected sound.<br />When I first listened to the previews of the songs on this album, I thought I would be disappointed with the purchase. Why? The melodies were unique and so getting a full picture of the song from a tiny clip was impossible. You cannot capture the power and soul of these songs in a short clip. Period.<br /><br />What does it sound like?<br />-The previous albums that they have released mostly reveal and reverberate in internal conflicts that they faced as artists. This album deals with acceptance and reverberates in it.<br /><br />For myself, an old soul with an open mind, this was what I needed. I absolutely love this latest album -I found listening to it to be completely euphoric. The lyrics are prophetic and selfless, the vocals more powerful than ever and full of essence, the music-perfected and the drums bring it all home. Again if you are at a balanced point in life this is your album. If you want to be balanced this is your album. If you come looking for the dissonant/harder sounds of their past this probably isn't your bag. Buy it anyways though; because all happiness stems from the ideas that they project in the music. It'll help you grow.
B002NZV68U|5.0|I'm not a film-reviewer, but I have to say a few words about this movie. After watching Johnny Depp's \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" a couple times, I simply had to have my own copy. Johnny Depp is simply spectacular in this film. And the casting, plot, staging, animation and overall cinematography are outstanding. The film is funny, outrageous, whimsical and a great adventure all in one.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have all of the Jack Reacher novels, and am in a 12 step program to get over it! But this book was so implausible that it interfered with Jack Reacher's appeal. Obviously, there are only so many things that a man hitchhiking through the country can get involved with, but it might be time to develop the Reacher character to a higher degree- like John Rain has done. Some relationships, more history- that would make it more believable.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|David Fincher has always had a loyal fan base. His films have been winning people over for twenty years with films like \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"Se7en\\" developing a cult-like following. Criterion Collection's release of \\"The Game\\" feels like some lucky schmuck discovered diamonds in an abandoned coal mine. Now remastered with loads of special features, \\"The Game\\" continues Fincher's near flawless streak of impeccable filmmaking.<br /><br />Films that are capable of making you think and turning your brain inside out are personal favorites; \\"Inception,\\" \\"Oldboy,\\" \\"The Machinist,\\" and \\"Fight Club\\" are spectacular examples. \\"The Game\\" can be categorized right along with the best of them. Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a successful investment banker complete with Swiss bank accounts, fancy cars, and a huge house; Nicholas has it all. But he was noticeably unhappy and the death of his father from when he was a boy still haunts him.<br /><br />On his 48th birthday, his ex-wife Elizabeth (Anna Katarina) along with all of his co-workers and his maid Ilsa (Carroll Baker) wish him a happy birthday but Nicholas views it as just another day. That is until his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) introduces him to CRS - Consumer Recreational Services. Shrouded in secrecy, Nicholas has no idea what to expect. Little does he realize that his life is about to be on the line along with his fortune.<br /><br />The choreography in this psychological thriller is brilliant. It helps establish the rich atmosphere of the film whether it's the fluorescent hum of office building lighting, the slow rotating shots as Nicholas eats his birthday dinner in his home, or the incredible break-in sequence filled with graffiti that's infused by black lighting. Just like all of Fincher's work, it pulls you in so easily. The story is constantly engaging. It's nearly impossible to predict how far this game is going to go and at what lengths Nicholas will go to discover the truth.<br /><br />The performances are fantastically solid. Michael Douglas does an excellent job of portraying a man who once had everything and basically has nothing by the end of the film. While Sean Penn has a small amount of screen time, his performance is different every time he shows up; calm and collected, frantic and borderline insane, and eventually the understanding brother.

Michael Douglas does an excellent job of portraying a man who once had everything and basically has nothing by the end of the film. While Sean Penn has a small amount of screen time, his performance is different every time he shows up; calm and collected, frantic and borderline insane, and eventually the understanding brother.

B003VPWXRO|5.0|Personally, I hate books about anorexia, but this book was amazing. Portia De Rossi's voice is captivating and her rhetoric is well thought out.
B0060D0R2C|4.0|I bought this movie thinking it was \\"man on fire\\".  Then i realized my error.  Turned out to be a very good movie which I had heard nothing about.
B007TML4EI|4.0|I like this game.  I play it often.  I only really have a couple of gripes.  First, there is no criteria for damage to the dummy.  If you just touch it, you lose.  In addition, you can run the same configuration twice and get different results.  I don't know if this is by design or not.  Anyway. it is a good, distracting game.
B000GOZ0ZK|4.0|All around good story and cast.<br />LL Cool J is great and the action with the sharks is very well done.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I have had the Jorte Calendar on all my android devices and it works very well to sync up other calendars I have.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Typical Mitch Albom; he reminds us that we often misinterpret what we value most, and what we may wish for may not be what we really think it is.<br />In The Time Keeper, Albom reminds us that our time on this earth valuable because it is limited. I always emerge from Albom's books humbled by his ability to point out something so obviously overlooked.
B000I9WWCM|5.0|The story, the music, the acting, the characters all work to bring this delightfully British film into a credible story of a bookish character and a very famous movie star. Each of the many times I've watched it, nuances are discovered anew.<br /><br />If you've not seen it - I so envy you a first time viewing!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This was a great season.  The plot line is tight and the characters compelling.  Way to go Tara for staking a claim on Jax
B008X77K8W|5.0|I became a fan of Chris Knight via Pandora. Little Victories is another great addition to his catalog. All the songs are good but \\"Jack Loved Jesse\\" and \\"Missing You\\" are my favorites so far.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|That ending was amazing, Im shocked... sad for both Gideon and Eva because it was alot of BS but it aint over yet.... whos ready.for book three!!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great read.  I was waiting for someone to come out and provide the \\"true\\" story of this operation.  I applaud Mr. Owen for sticking his head out once again to provide us with this account.  The attempt to smear the author's reputation prior to publication was shameful.  There are plenty of Delta and 6 team guys writing books these days.  Why all the hate for Mr. Owen I will never understand.  Thank you Mr. Owen for giving us a glimpse of what it takes to not only become a Navy Seal, but advance to Team 6.  I hope this book inspires others to follow in your footsteps of becoming Americas finest warriors.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|Not a movie for everyone but if you love some action and amazing fighting this one's for you! It even has a decent story line.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So tantalizing and unforgettable! Takes a while to get started, but the story line is so great, you will not regret this purchase!  You will feel as though you are right in the book.  I could not stop reading it or thinking about it.  It is unlike ANY book you will EVER read. Give it a try, it just might save your marriage; or at the very least spice up an even perfect marriage:)
B008IJT0CE|5.0|REALLY RELAXING AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO CHOOSES FROM.  I THINK THAT THIS I APP WAS WORTH THE PRICE I PAID.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|I fell in love with this series immediately and One Foot in the Grave didn't disappoint! I think Cat and Bones are one of my favorite paranormal couples!!!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Just like most people, I think that it is the song of the summer.  It sticks in your head and you find yourself singing it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like using this for a quick look at my local weather...and it's helpful when traveling. Haven't had any problems with it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|nice way to waste some time when you should be working.  fun for my kids as well. reminds me of the arcade days of my youth. _
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I waste countless hours a week playing this game. I can't stop myself! I keep hitting \\"play again\\" every time I get a game over.
8866130907|4.0|I've been using this planner for all of 2012 so far and gotta say I really love it. The layout is perfect, calendar on the left - notebook paper on the right. Perfect for grocery lists, to-do's, reminders, anything.<br /><br />The planner itself has stayed pretty structurally sound despite the abuse it faces every day in my purse or backpack. The rounded corners keep the edges from getting jammed and the spine is pretty sturdy.<br /><br />The ribbon bookmark makes getting to the right page simple, no flipping through looking for your spot.<br /><br />The elastic band is particularly useful to me because I keep a lot of loose papers and receipts tucked in the pages, the band keeps all that nice and secure, nothing ever spills out.<br /><br />The pocket in the back is the only reason this doesn't get 5 stars. It's made of sturdy card stock but still seems like it would rip if you really used it much, I've not found it to be very functional and don't ever use it.<br /><br />Other than that - Definitely buying another for 2013!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I love follet's ability to incorporate history with a good story. I had trouble putting this book down. I would've given it five stars had the price been a little better but I had been waiting too long for this book not to get it!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary should be required viewing for everyone, It explains what happened, why it happened and how it happened very clearly and concisely. It offers solutions on how to fix things and how to prevent them from happening again. It is fair and balanced while being unflinchingly honest and brutally straight forward. It does all this matter of factly without resorting to histrionics and partisan name calling.  It calls out everyone! Well almost everyone...I think if (and that's a big if) it was missing anything it would be touching on the culpability of the American people as well but I think that actually would be another documentary. This movie sets out to explain what happened to cause the crisis and it does it very well. If this does not wake people up I am not sure what will.<br /><br />I think the casual observer not familiar with finance and wall street will learn a lot and one can only hope this is illuminating to those in politics and working on Wall Street (stop rolling your eyes!). Interestingly I came away with a different feeling about Eliot Spitzer....<br /><br />The movie is fast paced which is good but I stopped and rewound a few times.  Also make sure you watch the DVD extras too, more great stuff there. One clip gave some interesting theory into the thought process of those people responsible and how they could do such things. Another nice thing was looking at countries like Singapore that work and what they do different we might learn from<br /><br />I want to reiterate how fair and balanced I believe this is, contrary to what a few others say.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|As a great fan of Lee Child, I have read every Jack Reacher novel.  This last one, Wanted Man, was huge disappointment to me.  The Reacher action was absent and the story itself was very slow-moving.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Well this is one movie that I could watch over and over and tire of it.<br />I especially love to watch movies based on true stories as this one is.<br />Sandra Bullock is a favorite actress of mine and she played the part like a champion.<br />Thumbs up!!
0316228532|2.0|I am not a particular fan of fantasy fiction, although I gamely read the Harry Potter series with my children, so when I heard that JK was coming out with a novel void of giant serpents and smoking wands, I looked forward to reading it immensely. However, by page 20 I would have given my left nut for even one glimpse of a flying motor car or slithering snake.  Rowling offers up a bland assortment of tedious townspeople who she never  developes in any interesting way.  Flat characters,a dry narrative style and predictable plot made this story a dull afternoon with a cup of tepid tea.  Sorry JK, but perhaps you should confine your writing to the hallowed halls of Hogwarts after all.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is a very well put together app , LOTS of different effects very easy to doctor up a picture . A++++++
B0090EHVMC|3.0|Expected more based on the book. Movie just didn't have the engagement or polish of a cars, shrek or toy story.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|Its a good design But on a Phone there isnt alot you can do Like you can on a computer .
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Talk about performanc. This novel goes from 0-60 in about 2 seconds! Love Jack Reacher and I think this is the best offering from Mr. Child. Looking forward to the Tom Cruise version of Jack...coming to a theater near me.<br />David Cloud
B0098VXE50|3.0|The costumes and general look of the picture were nice.  The supporting cast performances were more notable than that of the principle cast. Overall the film did not live up to all the hype in my opinion.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|You don't want to stop reading.  Deborah Harkness has written a captivating read.  Follow this with \\"Shadow of Night\\".  It's excellent as well.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Riveting is a good descriptive word for this book, as you will not want to put it down. Action packed and full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing.
B0015O5XUM|4.0|I have looked to try  to find a real collection of Van music this album has brought together all my favorites and some gems I had never heard. By far the best of all music from the Man.
B0052GACNM|2.0|I am a big fan of Tony Bennett so it is with some sadness that I give this two stars only. If you are an easy listening fan you may find something of interest here. For those of us coming from the Jazz side this is a very disappointing album, no improvisation, little spontaneity and overproduced numbers complete with orchestra and syrupy violins. Duets 1 was borderline in this respect but Duets 2 is simply boring. Lady Gaga and Willy Nelson contribute some cute numbers but on the whole one to avoid. Also the record is badly mastered with poor dynamic range. I have a longer review of this on my blog - the link is in my profile.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and it was a very quick read.  Before I read it, I thought I might recommend it to my teenage son, but after completing it, I would not until he is older.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|While the silent communication in the car was clever and gave some interesting stuff about the Reacher character's mind and thought process, the formula was too evident and the orgy of violence at the end was gratuitous and boring and unnecessary. I hope Lee Child is not getting bored and tired and pumping them out. I have loved this series.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's not like you actually win anything real, but it's fun and challenging (albeit only slightly).<br />Option to purchase more coins, bit it's not as in-your-face as most.<br />Great way to kill time!
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Winter of the World is the second in the series the Century of Giants Trilogy.  The first being Fall of Giants.  It is a well written book which grabs your attention from the very first page.  Unlike some of the earlier Ken Follett novels which I felt you had to work your way into.<br /><br />Winter of the World has the same characters, and/or there descendants, as the Fall of Giants but this novel is about the second world war.  An ntriguing read which I recommend to all who enjoy the details of history intermingled with a story of peoples lives.<br /><br />Brian Olsen
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book series is addictive.  Read this one in one week - definately a page turner.  Getting ready to start #3.  Fifty shades of exciting
B005O7Q6ZW|5.0|The audience for Castle keeps growing in our house, Now we have to move furniture to get the gang in. Our favorite episodes, \\"Nikki Heat\\" and \\"Cops and Robbers\\", get watched when there is no Castle in sight. The show has great texture, Castle's family is fun and believable and what goes on with them frequently reflects what goes on when he's with her family, the detectives, who are very distinct and interesting themselves. At the top of the bill Stana Katic is the detective all men hope arrests them and Nathan Fillian is a charmer. Great fun, great mystery, sometimes astonishing drama.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a very good movie. I read the book and was not disappointed in the movie. Looking forward to maybe a second movie???
B000HF0ISC|5.0|This is a multi-faceted, in-depth film.<br />It made me think, love, and cry.<br />I would recommend it for an adult audience!!
B002WY65VU|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. Brand new copy to wear out in my dvd player!! My kids love this movie, definitely a great investment.
B000ID1J5E|5.0|Kevin Bacon is so bad (devious & evil), he's good!<br />Meryl Streep also puts in a good performance.<br />Entertainment with suspense. I enjoyed watching it.<br />I watched 3 other films with Kevin Bacon in malicious roles,<br />so he died 4 times that day!!  Then I watched Footloose...
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Using characters that live and interact within the various countries impacted by World War II, Ken Follett helps us to understand the behind the scenes dynamics which led up to and caused the horrific events of this World War.  I learned a lot more about World War II history because I learned about what it must have been like to live through it as an English, a Russian, an American and a German citizen.  This is a truly unbiased account of life and events, on many different levels, during this historic time.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Great classic game to pass the time. As bad as it might sound, the kids love it too and teaches them arc, gravity, and cause and effect.
0525953728|5.0|I´m a Portuguese army officer and I recommend this bock to everyone.<br />It contains lots of good info how the things are doing since the training and the planning until the end of a operation. As we read the bock we are inside of the unit . I sincerely recommend
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Great book.  I look forward to all Lee Child books about Jack Reacher.  I will buy future Lee Child books about Jack Reacher.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This is a good  \\"Steven King-like\\" novel.  The main character is believable, though most of the others are stereotypes, we've seen before.  The resolution is good, though somewhat predictable.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|No one can imagine what combat is like unless you've been there, but Chris tells his stories factually, and candidly without any pretense, and you hear some of what our troops have to deal with everyday.  He also blends in humor and heart and becomes the kind of character you want to know more about and want to go have a beer with.  Chris is a genuine hero, as are all the troops fighting to keep us safe, and their stories should serve to make us appreciate them even more.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|This is a great stress reliever. My kids are enjoying it also especially the part when he purrs drinks the milk.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The last book is a little dull... But the first and second are great! But i recommended anyway . It was a great experiece knowing Mr. Grey, and like all others womens , wolrdwile, fall for him!
0142419400|4.0|~4.5/5<br />[Also available at my blog.]<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. I've had it for a while, have wanted to read it for even longer, and had even planned to read it for the last couple months, but for some reason never got around to actually doing it. When packing books to bring with me on vacation, I was pretty set on bringing this one with me, and I'm glad. Sadly, I planned to put it off till later on the trip, but ended up reading it rather fast instead. And I'm really glad that I finally got to it. It really shouldn't have taken me so long.<br /><br />I'd heard a lot of good things about this, including from several authors that I like, and it sounded like my type of book. It has big focus on romance, even if it's the kind that is pushed off for a long time, it's funny, with a type of humor I enjoy, the characters were well done, the romance was put together really well and had a good pace to it. This book is filled with things I like.<br /><br />Anna, the main character, is forced to move to France to go to a boarding school, where she ends up meeting St. Clair and his friends, who she quickly forms a friendship with. She's upset about leaving her best friend back home, and her mother and brother, and is mad at her rich, predictable-romance writing father who sent her there. It takes her a little while to get used to everything, but she does, especially with the help of St. Clair.<br /><br />I liked Anna. She wasn't whiny or too insecure or selfish. She wasn't completely selfless or anything, either, though. She was nice, as nice as she could be, while disagreeing with people and trying to deal with a new place, new language, being away from home, and liking someone who has a girlfriend already. I really liked St. Clair, and her and him together.<br /><br />Their relationship was really well done, and I was impressed with that. They got to know each other, turned into best friends, even while trying to ignore the flirting and feelings that they obviously had for each other. Neither of them was perfect, and they both knew it; they were perfect for each other, or whatever. A lot of the book was spent with them getting to know each other, and none of it was boring or dragged out; the pace was pretty perfect. There were some parts, of course, where I just wanted them to get together already, and there was so much teasing, but overall it was good.<br /><br />Along with getting to know St. Clair, we also get to know their friends. All of who had actual personalities, and most of whom I liked. There were several scenes where Anna is just hanging out with some of the others, which I liked; her entire life was not centered on her feelings on St. Clair. She also went home one time in the book, so we got to meet her brother and her best friend, and the guy she maybe likes, and got to hear more about her parents.<br /><br />The timeline in the book goes through the whole school year, so a lot happened. I'm not going to go into too much detail, though, and let you find those things out yourself (when you read the book, `cause you should, if you haven't already).<br /><br />The ending was really good. We find out what their plans for later are, and those seem to be very good and should work out really well. We also got to see them as an actual couple, and I found them a bit adorable.<br /><br />I just really liked everything about this book. The more I think about it, the more I find reasons why I liked it. I was expecting to like it, but was surprised by how much and how well done everything in it was. It was pretty much amazing, has kind of made me fall in love with it, and I want the next one immediately, and don't plan on waiting too long to get it. I want it that bad.ously had for each other.

B003B02OOG|3.0|The book was an easy read but I prefer a full novel rather than the 5 different segments in the book.  Not what I expected.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|All in all, pretty lame for a Reacher story.  Not enough ass kicking and no romantic interest this time around.  And I found myself not really caring whether the mystery was solved or not.  And when it was solved, I really didn't get it.  Terrorist deposits secured by stockpiles of nuclear waste that doesn't even exist???  Secreted in America's heartland???  I mean I know it's fiction and all, but come on Lee.  I had come to believe that Reacher novels were a given.  This one proved me wrong.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|just want to start off with this is a great survival knife, this knife is a \\"jack of all trades, master of none\\" and to me, thats what makes a true survival knife...<br /><br />Ive got no complaints about the handle...ive got man hands and a firm grip so i dont have problems with the smoothness of the handle that ive heard some complaints about and almost had me convinced to buy the micarta handles, hell, most wooden handles are sanded smooth, most all knife handles are smooth, its about curves and your grip, ive used a \\"slick\\" handled knife before and this is definitely not slick, you just have to hold it like you have a pair :)<br /><br />good sheath, i like the thumb pressure release, it does not dull the blade, my blade doesnt even touch the sheath, my only issue with the sheath is that it does not attach onto my assault bag (army bag)conveniently, poor me i know, it has the belt strap, button strap for knife handle, but no button straps for what i call, \\"survival loops\\", ill be modifying that, adapt and overcome<br /><br />if you plan on keeping this on your belt, dont, it weights about a pound...the way i roll is my knives/gear/equipment are strategically placed on/in my assault bag (army bag), i keep a smaller lighter knive on me but i try not to carry too much in my pockets (gloves, flashlight, small knife) and i never have anything attached to my belt when im in strategic mode<br /><br />the blade is 1/4inch thick, straight, solid(1095 cro-van steel)and heavy...the factory edge (20 degrees) is pretty sharp, itll last depending on how you use it, im not going to get into how to make an edge last longer but give it a looking into...good hardware, you can put lock nuts on to prevent them from loosening..<br /><br />i looked at this knife for 3 days straight before i made my decision, i paid $64 total, no doubt best survival knife you could buy for $64, i would like to add that there are better knives for specific purposes, broad uses with heavy armor is what the bk2 is about, thats what a survival knife is about
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A little different from other Jack Reacher novels I've read, but very interesting and exciting. Lee Child continues to add more layers to an already interesting & dynamic character.
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|This is a fresh, non-linear spin on the stale romantic dramedy genre.<br /><br />Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel have great chemistry together and apart and together and...<br /><br />Even Disney musical numbers, like the big Central Park routine in  \\"Enchanted,\\" take on a whole new meaning! ;)<br /><br />I'd probably give the HD transfer about three stars... nothing jaw dropping in the visual department here.<br /><br />Though, perhaps the fact that this was a relatively low budget production might have something to do with it.<br /><br />Well worth a buy on Blu.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is really cute.  I play it with my little kids and they are addicted.  Pls add me my id is warcraftgirl
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Picked up right where book one left off; an excellent series. I also read \\"Pillars of the Earth;\\" another great read.
B008LVCKH6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is totally implausible, but very entertaining.  I am going to recommend it to my<br />book club.  Most of our choices are so serious and dreary, so this should be a nice change.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|they story kept me  reading and not wanting to put the kindle down. I cant wait for the next book!
B002APU580|5.0|I've watched this movie several times on cable tv and decided to purchase it.. So glad I did . I have shared it with my other 2 daughters who now , also love it !!! Enjoy the beauty and innocence of the age !!!
B00846REIS|4.0|Ok so it was heavily inspired by Fifty Shades....but it was still really good! I loved the fact that Eva was not so innocent. It was disturbing what happened to her and I felt she was so strong to take steps to overcome her trauma.<br /><br />Cannot find any differences between Gideon Cross and Christian Grey....pretty much same character. Although I am anxious to learn what his trauma is...Very Good Read!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher is still my very favorite character.  He does it all in this book.  If you're new to Reacher, this will move you to get to know him.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|\\"Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated....I see the way you're actin like you're somebody else gets me frustrated....\\"--Complicated by Avril Lavigne<br /><br />This is the song that was going through my mind during certain parts of this book!!<br /><br />The book starts where book one leaves off...<br /><br />Gideon and Eva are trying to make it work!  They are trying to find what works for their relationship.<br /><br />Then it gets complicated...<br /><br />People from the past emerge...Gideon starts to distance himself from Eva but then comes back and swears she is the only one and she needs to understand that how he is acting is a necessity.  I get whip lash from he how is acting and I understand how Eva reacts.<br /><br />Why can't men just trust women to understand....why keep so many secrets??<br /><br />The major theme of this book is Trust!  To trust someone and not what hear or even what you SEE (this totally trips me out).  I don't know how Eva did it!!<br /><br />The last few chapters were amazing.  You finally learn why Gideon is so messed up.  You also confirm that they are made for each other....that they transcend love.<br /><br /> \\"People get over love. They can live without it, they can move on. Love can be lost and found again.  But that won't happen for me.  I won't survive you, Eva.\\"<br /><br />I can not wait till book 3...already Pre-Ordered!!
B0090EIC3Y|1.0|This movie was just terrible.  It was embarrassing to watch.  The funny parts are few and far between - it is blatantly just gross in some parts but not in a funny way.  Sacha Baron Cohen lost the fine line he walked on Borat between vulgarity and hilarity and dove right into the vulgar side.  He lost the funny on this one.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This is really a twisp and turns book.  What a hoot to read!!  I love how the characters form a unique and close bond.  This is an excellent read and will keep you guessing about what is next.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I read it in one sitting--couldn't put it down!  It led to an extremely interesting discussion with my book club, with issues including foster care, self-reliance, mental illness, adoption, motherhood, commitment, passions of various kinds. Additionally, all the information about flowers was fascinating.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I adore Ellen.  She is the epitome of what a loving, caring human being should be.  I watch her show often.  But this book, for me, was just boring.  I was hoping to get to know Ellen better as a person.  It was just snippets of her comedy.  It got to the point where I thought I heard rim shots after each punch line, and I do not have the audio version!  Love her, not this book.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Don't care for Kristen Stewart in the Snow White role, but otherwise wonderful movie.  Charlize Theron is striking as usual.
B008KOMMTA|4.0|I like purchasing collector's edition item's specially when it comes to movies. This is a nice Titanic Collector's Edition to add to my Collection of movies. It arrived on time. Although after removing it from the outside delivery box, I notice the outside clear covering was torn on one corner. I was a bit disappointed with this but over all it was in good condtion. For a collector's edition, I expected everything to be in perfect condition. Do to the outside clear covering being torn on the one corner of a Collector's Edition is why I gave a 4 star rating on this Titantic Collector's Edition.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The Hunger Games was a likable series. It is an easy read. The story line keeps you interested, but is somewhat predictable.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|This is a really good book.  It was Interesting, unexpected, and good;  still, there are  a lot of fights,  and drinking.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Wanted Man rises to my expectations because yet again, Jack Reacher is in the wrong place at the right time.  There is, as always, a tightly woven plot and lots of action.  The ending finds Jack continuing on his way to Virginia in search of the woman that he wants to find and connect with - never met her, but wants to find out if what he feels is reciprocated.  The only reason that I set this as a 4 star is that we didn't move at all to him finding the girl, not even close.  Let's hope the next novel, which we will have to wait a year for, will finally show us that Jack finds the girl....
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This game does have great graphics and cute 'prizes'.  But you almost can't play without buying coins and I just didn't find it very interesting.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|great book, well written, great story... a little repetitive with some of the words used (most authors come up with more descriptive words, not the sames ones over and over, but all in all loved it.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The 5th book in this series completely forgets about characters included in the first four books and frankly left me wishing that I had not bought the book.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Bernard Cornwell  did such a magnificent job of  illuminating the dark ages. I will miss Uhtred, and I hope he reclaimed Babbenburg.  These stories are so well written and the history precise,  the characters are so rich and vivid and you are right there with them as the story progresses.  There are also some wonderful parallels between the strife of the 890's and the present day that the reader should find interesting commentary on politics, belief and religion . A wonderful end to a wonderful series.
B0089ZEEYG|5.0|This game is fun for all age. My 4 year old niece loves to play this game and so do I.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|When I was in high school, all of these works were contained in three heavy small printed tomes.  It is wonderful to have such a portable version of my favorite stories!  These stories are timeless and well worth your consideration.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Typical Jack Reacher.  Excellent story line, kept me guessing for a long time.  Hard to put down, I stayed up late in order to finish the book.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|After reading the The Hunger Games^ Series, the movie was pretty much true to the books. I can^t wait for the next movie to come out!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Started off just like the \\"old\\" Stephen King. Truly scary, then ended.  I guess I am just not a short story fan.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have this application on both my Android phone and my tablet. I have no need for my computer to have a keyboard, mouse or monitor since I have it all with this app. Makes managing my server as easy as loading up the app. Well done!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I had a photo problem I had been wrestling with for weeks, this program made it easy. It would make it ideal if you could change the aspect ratio. Great Job! Thank you
B008XG1X18|5.0|Productive and creative site, doesn't make me feel as if I wasted my time. It's helped us with ideas for the home in an affordable way
0061537969|5.0|This story is woven with a bit of dog, a bit of racing and a bit of wisdom.  I love how the books is sprinkled with the wisdom of manifesting and how the dog debunks Darwin.  This book is a super easy fast read. The characters are well defined.  All ages will enjoy this book. I highly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it wont let me install it I really want to install it. can someone plz tell me how to install it it says the install has failed try again plz help me install it
B002SSUQFG|4.0|The watch seems to hold good time and was easy to set.  The band has plenty of holes to fit several wrists.  The watch itself is smaller so it does not 'stick out' on smaller wrists, like mine.  It deos stop when sitting for maybe more than a day which I found somewhat disappointing but, it does not need a battery as it is self winding so I will be shaking it occasionally if I am not wearing it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is awesome and to watch it on a 3D High Definition (1080p) LCD TV brings it to another level of visual enjoyment.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Marvel Comics.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Warner Brothers needs to stop forcing their lousy UltraViolet digital copies on consumers. Being a Mac user, there was no way to download the UltraViolet copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 when I purchased the blu-ray with the digital copy, and I have refused to buy any other Warner Brothers films that don't offer a viable, download-able digital copy for Mac users ever since.
B008PNBU30|5.0|I've waited patiently 3 years for this new album to come out. 3DG did not disappoint at all!  The first two albums are so great all around but for some reason Life Starts Now left me a little empty and unfulfilled from my favorite band.  A few months ago the promos for Transit of Venus started making their way online and even though it was only snippets of a few songs I really loved the sound and knew I was going to love this album. I truly love every song on here!  I love the new sound, the low guitars and overall feel of the album as a whole. The chorus' stay in my head and the more I listen to the album the more I just want to play it over and over. They're never going to match what One-X did (and how could they) but Transit of Venus definitely comes close enough in my book.
B000J3OTTQ|1.0|The DVD played good for about 30 minutes then the rest was horrible...the movie would skip and pause....I was gonna return it but its to much hassle for a $2 item
B006LSZECO|4.0|GET THIS BOOK . It's worth your valuable reading time!<br />I am a veteran mystery reader, so I am tough to impress in this genre. The structure of two narrators with different time narrations was riveting.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice graphics...as accurate as most weather apps...only complaint is it force closes at times...fix that and it will be perfect.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I cant believe im already done......sad. :( this is such a good book. i cant wait for the next one.........
B008XBHIEY|4.0|Classic that I could watch over and over. Rented this for my daughter to watch for the first time.  \\"Scary Dad..but its awesome\\".
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book covers a great deal in the life and development of a Navy Seal.  The narrative culminates in the killing of Osama bin Laden.  The sacrificies made by members of a seal team are extrodinary and desevere the praise and thanks of all Americans.  Allegations of classified material are politically motivated because nothing is told, if fact less is told, of the final operation than has already been leaked by the administration.  Definitly worth readying.  I highly recommend this book.  R. Carroll, Col, USAF, Retired
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Agribusiness is a popular word you may have heard. _Food, Inc._ will introduce you to some key players in the world of agricultural business, and points us all in the directions that are better for eaters, farmers, and America: back to growing/fattening the way God designed it. (Sidenote: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture is a joke. American crops and herds were better before it assumed its place among the eternal ever-expanding departments of the Federal Empire.)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Reading the book was so much better than the movie.  At first  I was not going to read the book, i thought it was a teen book.  When i saw it free for Amazon Prime I thought I‘d give it a try.  I really enjoyed every bit. It explained so much that had been left out of the movie. I‘d recommend this one to my friends for sure.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A book about the unchanging state of the human race.  From the gladiators to the gratuitous violence on TV which seems to be compelling viewing. Unchanging supply and demand.
B001A3GSFW|5.0|The Ramones Greatest Hits is an excellent product!  There are quite a few songs on it which I knew that I was unaware they had created.  The sound quality is great, and I enjoy listening to it.  I have had no technical difficulties using it.  The download was quick and easy.  I highly recommend this product!
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|ALTHOUGH I LIKED THE FIRST BOOK (SOMETHING BORROWED,) I LOVED SOMETHING BLUE. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.  IT COVERS MANY FEELINGS WE HAVE AS ADOLESENT GIRLS.  WE GOT TO WATCH DARCY GROW UP.  GRANTED, SHE WAS A LITTLE IMMATURE FOR HER AGE BUT LETS FACE IT \\"IT TAKES WHAT IT TAKES\\"  THE AUTHOR MATURED HER SUPERBLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|This was a very enjoyable book to read.  The characters in the story seem very real and relatable.  I went on to read book two and enjoyed it as well.  I hope to read all 8 books in the series.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|For me, the Killers only get better and better. I like all of their material, but this album is special--every single song is catchy and enjoyable. I can't stop listening to this album, and whether you already love the Killers or not, this album is definitely worth buying.
B005ES0XQY|4.0|Ordered a size 11 which is the same as my shoe size. These are a little big but I can still wear them. They arrived quick and are great.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I was worried about this book, due to a few reviews that were less than favorable.  My wife and I have both read this book, and we both loved it!  Reacher never fails to tease you into having to see what is going to happen next, and the plot twists are always interesting.  This book was no different.  I assume the next in the series will take place near Virginia, as that is where he is headed.  I WILL get the next one, when it comes out, to find out!  Recommended for all who enjoy Lee Childs, and I suggest for any who haven't read a Reacher, start now.  You don't have to start with the first book:  they all fit in just fine, in whatever order you consume them!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a remarkable story. The main character, a broken young women is memorable.Her tragic past mixed with her love of flowers and their meanings  made this a book I did not want to put down. Be prepared to leave your own sense of reality and join these wonderful characters.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I had to play this every day.  I loved it more than angry birds.  I can't wait until they add more levels!!!
B007SRZULW|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites. I have read it three times. I like it because it really is a book about the folly of being judgemental.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennett observes her sisters as being a flighty and air headed. Yet they all seem to find husbands and happiness before her. All of them except poor Mary, she kind of reminds me of myself actually, she's the nerdy one.<br /><br />Elizabeth judges everyone, her mother, her father, her sisters and especially Mr. Darcy. In fairness, he deserves the harsh judgement, no one calls Elizabeth Bennett plain, no matter how rich he is!<br /><br />It is written in high prose style, but don't be put off by it. Pride and Prejudice is a beautifully written book and well worth reading.
B003VBVQKS|5.0|people, this is a great album...it has much better sound and punch than all previous editions. crank it up and see for yourself!
0345803485|1.0|When E L James wrote Fifty Shades of Grey in her poorly penned erotic \\"book\\" she describes clinical sex, domination, control freaks, sex freaks, and stupid college girls. Boy meets girl, boy ties girl up, boy has his naughty way with girl, boy falls in love with girl, and so on and so on. Yes, it is  filthy, I got three quarters way through it and still wasn't hooked.<br /><br />The characters in EL James' book are so cardboard, that I couldn't care less if Grey, the dominant, and Steele, the submissive, nailed each other to the wooden crucifix at the end of his bed, tied themselves in chains dangling from the ceiling, or imploded upon impact. I take that back, imploding upon impact would have done both characters a great justice.<br /><br />Most middle aged women I know, and older ladies too, loved the book. These are not silly women, nor are they women lacking anything in their lives, nothing that they have shared with me anyway. This is the part of Fifty Shades of Grey that amazes me. It is a hit among older women.<br /><br />E L James has somehow captured the attention of middle-aged women, and senior citizens too, with a book that I think is written badly. One of the women who read it and loved it, taught elementary school all of her life, and is now in her late sixties. I just don't understand it!<br /><br />I won't be reading the trilogy, that's for sure.
0307887448|5.0|If you are a geek or love the 1980's, this book is for you.  It is very well written with a few nice turns and twists you don't see coming.  The very end left a little be desired, but it didn't take away from the whole story.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|fun fun fun! love meryl and the rest of the cast!!  great sunday afternoon movie! makes you laugh and feel sorry for meryl's character miranda...
B0063IH60K|1.0|Loved this game before it was changed a short while ago.  It used to be that your standings were posted and the more you won, the better you standings were.  It added a competitive edge to the game. It would be better if, when someone quit in the middle of the game, you would still win. It is very frustrating when you are about to win and someone disconnects!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Better than book one. Can't wait fir book three. The characters all feel like family. Want to see what happens  next.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I like this app very much it is very soothing and fun.  I like the custmazation in it and its just plain out good.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am reading it again because I enjoyed it so much then I am so excited to start #2!!! #2 was just published October 2nd!!! So pumped......
B000XXI8G2|1.0|bought these shoes for the nasty autumn Moscow weather hoping they would keep me dry and comfy but got disappointed.<br />after the very first walk in the rain i found out my left boot is leaking. not great news since i bought them just for that very kind of weather.<br />returning them is not an option as i am from overseas.<br />sizing is another weak point - i normally wear size 10 but even size 9 feels at least half size bigger.<br />had to put another insole for them to fit comfotable.<br />one other thing is that the tongue of the boot is stiched from 2 pieces of leather.<br />you guessed it right - the sitching started to come apart 3 days later.<br />overall i'm not very impressed as i feel quality control is something timberland has overlooked with this particular boots.
B001AFF25W|5.0|Very Practical suggestion. I have both audible and Kindle version. I listen to audible version when commuting & read it other times.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob was a heartaching read that was really hard to set down. Very well written, a really great story that kept you guessing and on edge until the end. I loved this book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Loving this!<br />this is just too much fun...addictive and I don't get into games that easily.<br />It is awesome and looking forward to more.
B007GATVYI|4.0|I will recomend this book to anyone who wants to get inspired about the life story of a great entrepreneur, such Zappos CEO. This book has some great insights about Customer Service, but if you want to go deeper into this topic I won't recommend you this book.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|We have come to expect more from Lee Childs. We always look forward to Child's new books and love to spend time with Jack Reacher.  This wasn't his best effort.
B007CGU3K2|5.0|i have read this book many times and as always it is a gut wrenching sadistic coming of age tale that takes place in a society that breeds awfulness, I love this book and I would recommend reading it, I would also recommend never watching the movie because it just completely missed the bus on capturing the essence and the moral of this grim tale. [[ASIN:B0025VX3BU A Clockwork Orange]]
B001R6AW18|5.0|Simply amazing blu-ray of a 80+ year old classic. The blu-ray breathes new life into this timeless movie. It's like watching it for the first time. Buy this at all costs.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|This television series is really good and creepy.  The picture was great and so was the sound.  The music they start with is really edgy and will give you chills.  The acting is really good and the plot will keep you guessing to what will happen next until the very end.  I love this series and will definitely will be watching the second season this year.  If you are into haunted house movies you will like this series also.  This television series is up there with Son's of Anarchy and the Walking Dead.  I definitely recommend this blu-ray.  I give this blu-ray a solid A.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three of fifty shades and was pleased with the ending.They are a little to much sex but a good love story.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is a great game, and I'm more angry than the birds. Great free-bie. Easy way to pass time. This is seasons 11 and 12.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|After I got hooked with the first book in this series I heard there is also an HBO series. I haven't watched it but definitely wanted to continue reading. A Dance With Dragons brings the characters together in a way that makes me anxious to continue with next book in the series....can't wait!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is nice to know I can depend on the weather channel every day to read about current weather and 10 day forecasts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I wasn't sure if i would be interesting in reading this book but after chapter 3 it was a sure thing that i didn't want stop reading it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app I play it everyday and it is soooooo FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />temple run is my favorite app and it always will be!!!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I thought it was very different but i couldnt quit till i finished  i would recomend it to be a must read
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I never thought I would read a book from my phone. Now I'm on my second book. This is an excellent App. I was surprised that it works great independently and also allows me the option of sincing to the page I left off on my Kindle for PC. No remembering the page where you left off or having to skip around to find it.<br />It has the same options as my Kindle for PC!<br /> Very simple to use.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am currently reading this one.  So far I really like it. Book 1 was so awesome. I just had to get book 2 and 3 to see how it ends.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I had not read the Hunger Games; it did not appeal to me.  I am not drawn to sci-fi or post apocalyptic themes.  Then I reluctantly watched the movie (I was outvoted).  I really liked it and if I liked the movie well, the book must be better.  I bought the book and ended up reading the series non stop.  I won't say they were the best books I ever read, but I was very entertained and would recommend them to anyone who likes to escape with a good book.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|An excellent portraeil of a very complex character. a very short read for a very long book. Could hardly bare to put it down.<br /><br />Also a good review of the birth of the computer industry.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This is such a staggering film, I'm not sure where to begin. The acting is incredible.  Editing and music are both excellent.  Everyone naturally focuses on the nonlinear plot.<br /><br />I've seen the movie twice.  First time blind, and was sitting there during the creation/formation scene wondering what in the world was going on.  Once I got past that, the film focuses on the family in the 50's, and it was mesmerizing.  After seeing it, I thought about it for days.  I still think about it (obviously).<br /><br />I'm sure Brad Pitt considers it his best performance.  I have to laugh at Sean Penn's reaction - I'm not at all surprised to read that he doesn't understand his role.<br /><br />I think the director approaches film in a much different way than most - that is the film isn't a linear story told straight as if from a book.  Instead, images are snapshots taken sort of at random, much like the mind works, especially when at rest.<br /><br />So many vignettes are excellently portrayed here -- RL's impromptu duet with his father, the horrific BB rifle scene (and redemption), the playful scene when the father is gone, the awful scene where he steals, the garden scene with the father, the parallels of the waitress scene & the school girl scene, the window-tapping as they measure each other scene.<br /><br />The music is so important to this movie.<br /><br />This is probably the most religious movie I've seen, and I suspect a lot of people find that threatening.  For those of a religious bent, the ending should be plausible.  (I'm trying to avoid spoilers in this review)<br /><br />The one question I'd love to ask the director is why the need for the youngest brother, who is almost never in the movie.  I've read that the director's brother, overwhelmed by guitar studies,  mutilated his hand before killing himself.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.  However, if you cannot approach it with a completely open mind, it will be a waste of your time.<br /><br />The only way to be happy is to love.
B004LGE2LC|5.0|I love after the world catastrophe stories especially when it shows how people cope with the disaster.  This is one of the best with the scariest, most real dragons ever.  Unique story line.  I love it and have watched it 4 times and will again.  The characters are fully developed, its well acted and it makes you wish you knew them.
B0087HT36U|4.0|My daughter and I have had alot of fun playing Seige Hero. It is similar to the Angry Birds games.  Waiting to see what other versions follow.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|WOW!! After reading Bared to You a couple of months earlier, I was counting down to the publication of Reflected in You. Well it was so worth the wait!! If you are a fan of Gideon and Eva, this book will not disappoint.  Carey also has an interesting story and I hope we learn more about his past in book 3. Yes Gideon is controlling and sometimes so obsessive you want to scream, but a moment later you want to hug away all the hurt he's suffered in his life. Sometimes I just wanted to be Eva.  It was a roller coaster ride of emotions. The book is so well written that even if you are new to this genre (as I am) you will become a fan of Sylvia Day's writing. Now my only critique is that I have to wait until December for the next chapter in this saga. In the meantime I think I'll just start all over again.....
B0068860WK|5.0|My younger daughter encouraged me to watch the first edition of this series. The story was told about a unit and walked you along with them through basic training to the D-Day invasion. They connected the story back to a few of the original company members as they told their story of what really happened to them. Wasn't overly bloody and gave me a very different perspedctive than I've had before about that awful yet glorious day.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Did not enjoy this book.  It was a repetition of everything I had already read in the news or heard on TV Broadcasts.<br />The training of the Seals has been talked about in many Spy thrillers.
0767817664|5.0|A great blend of youth humor, plot, special effects and surprises putting a different perspective on vampires from such new movies like Twilight and True Blood.  I highly recommend this product for the vampire fan who likes more than just blood and gore.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have trouble putting down a Follett book. This is one fof his better ones. A 5 star for sure.
6304779356|5.0|One of my favorite vampire movies.  A great movie with a great cast adding humor to the vampire gore.  Its great special effects combined with the \\"love story\\" blend and humor makes it a top movie.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I read all of child's works. This was one of the medicore one's I have read. It is hard to stay at the top of your game when your early works are outstanding. I will keep reading about Jack Reacher.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|WOULD RECOMMEND THE GAME TO ALL. IT IS A FUN PUZZEL GAME ADN FUNNY AS WELL TO WATCH THE BACK GROUN.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Great product to buy when I purchased it i had no regrets because It was new no fake real Sony authentic card! Alright seller!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I really enjoy this CD. It is different.Dylan continues to cross new bonds. I was surprised how much I like the song about the Titanic.
B0000013G9|5.0|Great product to purchase buy it if you really want to trust me no regrets at all when I purchased what I wanted!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book is beautifully written and replete with almost unbearable cruelty.  There is nothing happy about any aspect of it -- in Flynn's world there isn't much love to counter all the meanness and deliberate victimization .  But this is a book you will find hard to read slowly, and it will stay with you.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|One of the worst books I have ever read. Poor descriptions of where they were what was going on and the it lacked any excitement even when the helicopter got hung up on the wall. Just a very poor book. If it wasn't for supporting Vet's groups it would be a total waste of money.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child continues to come up with new parts of the US & new mysteries which Jack Reacher becomes involved in.  The twists & turns of the story are familar to his fans. He turns Nebraska & adjoining states into  exciting scenes & plenty of action. Never a dull moment !!
B0058P4QY8|5.0|I am new to Kindle. The format did not interfere with my reading. I enjoyed the stories and the accompanying illustrations. I did miss the study in scarlett. It is not included. I bought \\"The Complete Works\\" version to read the story
B000W93CHC|5.0|Very good character development. Just as good a Pillars of the Earth. Can't wait to see the movie. You don't have to read the Pillars of the Earth to enjoy this book.
B0001US8FI|5.0|When, I bought this I thought disc were two individual guess not. Box was flimsy too. But not too worry the dvd was awesome because bruce lee always bring classic fights to tv scenes. Thanks seller!
B00932A6G4|3.0|If you are a fan of the series you will probably like this one too.  It is CGI but there is plenty of bug killing and a little bit of story just like all the other ones.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I enjoyed the entire book beginning to end. It would make a great screenplay. The possibilities with CGI combined with this story would make it a real blockbuster. Harry Potter for adults.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a well written and suspenseful story that kept me on the edge of my chair.  There were surprises that took me on an emotional roller coaster and as a Motther made me feel as though I were going through this labyrinth with the family!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed this book up until the end, or lack of an ending, would be a better description! I felt like I was watching the Sopano's finale all over again and my screen went to black! I had to check for technical problems with my Kindle. It was working, I guess the author just forgot to turn in the entire manuscript. Unlike the Sopranos the lack of ending to this book made no sense and can't be explained or artisticly justified . It just leaves the reader angry and feeling robbed.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|the characters are real, the history is gripping but the author stretched the story out so much that it became very boring for the last quarter lof the book
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Can't stop playing!<br />Great game for killing time. Not recommended for small kids.  Takes lots of patience and time. Similar to the arcade game except you aren't wasting your own money.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|grafics are good and has a ton of fun levels. I would definitely recommend it.<br />fun game need to get the first one too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it. really fun I would recommend it to all takers that want a simple game to play have fun
B000FC10MU|4.0|Enjoyed the short stories scattered among the chapters more than the main story. Over all atmosphere was rather depressing. The once-powerful but diminished gods were as sad as the tawdry decaying tourist attractions.  Very well written, but I was expecting something lighter.<br /><br />Went back and looked up some details I wanted to describe to a friend.  Got hooked and read quite a lot over.  Enjoying more the 2nd time.  Love the zombie wife!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My children don't like it when I buy more coins to continue playing this game but like playing it Have completed one of the puzzles you play along with this game by getting the parts of the puzzles through without falling over the edge  Can play longer now that I have more coins coming my way
0525952926|5.0|I looked forward eagerly to the receipt of this wonderful book, and I was not disappointed. Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors, and he did a splended job fictionalizing the second world war. Coincidently, I was born in 1933 (in Warren, Ohio) and remember those awful years of World War 2. Mr. Follett's fictional characters were so real, and his injecting them into the affairs of the real characters of the era was not only realistic, but also delightfully portrayed. I can hardly wait until the third book of this trilogy is in print!!
0525953728|4.0|I ordered this book when it came out, and it was about what I expected it to be. For a first time author straight out of the service, it flows pretty well, although lacking some of the refinement of some other books. If you're looking for a great literary work that you'll read over and over, try something from Charles Dickens. If you want to know the insider details of a historic event, by all means pick it up and read it.
B000UZNSWM|4.0|Halberstam does a great job of combining detail on the war and describing what it was like for the participants.
0345803493|5.0|My husband had bought me Fifty Shades Of Grey I read the book and when I got to the end of the book I was sad-it just couldn't be over between Ana and Christian! I came straight to Amazon.com where I was able to read a few pages of the second book and realized right then that I had to have all of the Fifty Shades. I have finished all three books and loved them!
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Ron Fricke released the film \\"Chronos\\" in 1985 and then \\"Baraka\\" in 2001. In December, the new Ron Fricke film called \\"Samsara\\" will be released on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Ron Fricke was also the cameraman for the first of the three films for Godfrey Reggio. The film \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\".  All of Godfrey Reggio's films are enjoyable wordless collages of music and visuals.<br /><br />Those three Reggio films will be released as a Criterion box set called \\"The Qatsi Trilogy\\" and will be available on Blu-Ray in December as well.<br /><br />So, keep your eye out for these two new releases this year.<br /><br />UPDATE: This film definitely looks good, and the music is good, but some of the visuals are really confusing. And some scenes strangely follow a previously unrelated scene so I don't understand the message there. I still like \\"Baraka\\" much, much better, and even Ron Fricke's \\"Chronos\\" (for as short as it is) is stronger in appeal than \\"Samsara.\\" But, I am happy to have this in my collection, nonetheless.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As always, Childs doesn't disappoint - the Reacher novels are always entertaining.  Just having a hard time imagining Tom Cruise in the role..................
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Good stuff...no, GREAT stuff, as usual.  It took a lot longer for the butt-kicking to hit, as he had to work out problems using brain and legwork before it could happen. I only wish that these Reacher novels lasted more than two sittings!  They always end too soon!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The latest chapter to this trilogy did not cease to surprise me. It was sad to see some characters we loved go. But it was also great to see others come into there own.
B00881VLCE|4.0|it is a good puzzle game.  I wouldn't say though that it has anything special to offer but if you just want to waste time doing puzzles this woould be good for you.
0345803507|5.0|I have completed the three books of Fifty Shades. I have told my husband that their has to be a movie about this and I have told him who would be great actors to play Ana and Christian. I have not sat down to read a book since I was in college(late '90's)so I didn't think I was going to like the first one when my husband bought it for me but I was wrong, I couldn't stop reading every night. I would have to make myself put the book down and go to bed!! I recommend everyone to read all three of the Fifty Shades.

B007TK77QE|4.0|As a longtime Rowling fan, I was intrigued by the synopsis of Casual Vacancy, and curious to experience Rowling's mastery in an entirely new genre.  But I think I had fewer expectations than some other readers that Rowling's adult work would be \\"nice\\".  It isn't.  And that's ok.  A writer whose work for children was accused of being \\"too dark\\" and \\"too scary\\" isn't going to write something sweetly pretty for adults.<br /><br />With such different topic matter, it would be unfair to draw comparisons, yet it is almost inevitable that we will.  Like the HP books, there is humour here... but it's sardonic humour.  Like the HP books, there is a willingness to describe the unpleasantness of people... but less focus on good conquering evil.  And like the HP books, there is death here too... but not the glorious deaths that occur in a battle against evil; in Casual Vacancy the deaths are hopeless, helpless, and despairing.  They leave unfinished business, and messy, unsolvable problems.  But that, surely, is the whole point; that life is like that, people are like that, and it behoves us to make the best we can of what we have, both for ourselves and for others.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst that can be said about Casual Vacancy is that it shows traces of the fact that Rowling didn't have to write it - it doesn't appear quite as finely honed as the HP books, and at times (particularly in the first half of the book) it lacks their compulsive pace.  I found myself much more aware of Rowling's skill as a writer in Casual Vacancy, and much less engaged in the story - perhaps because there really isn't a huge amount of story.  Lots of character insights and introspection, but not a complex or sustained plot line, which unfortunately leaves the skill a little too obvious when it ought to be concealed.  The last 20% of it is very impressive, though, and lifted it from 3 stars to 3.5 in my view.  I gave it four in the end because I felt there were so many unfairly negative reviews that I decided to over-estimate rather than under-estimate.<br /><br />But all in all, Rowling has written a raw portrayal of the underbelly of civilisation, and the conflict between petty meanness and courage.  She, at least, has not averted her eyes.  Barry Fairbrother would be proud of her.hat I decided to over-estimate rather than under-estimate.<br /><br />But all in all, Rowling has written a raw portrayal of the underbelly of civilisation, and the conflict between petty meanness and courage.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read. Most WWII books are pretty depressing, but this book keeps the sad times short and the humor in life high.  It shows that even in the worst times, people can still find humor and joy.  I fell in love with each character and did not want this book to end!
B009329Y30|5.0|Love love love it!!!! I'm a big Nicholas sparks fan and watching this after. Reading the book was wonderful. Great match for the characters!
B0091XRTTM|4.0|Good movie. Potential was there for more. I hate to think that Grommet is the only top tier character. General production is better than before.
B003Y5H5EW|2.0|The movie was enjoyable, but not as good as the first three.  I gave this a rating of two stars because the seller provided me with an unusable code to redeem the ultraviolet portion.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Nothing is more relaxing than reading a good book on your kindle and listening to Adele. Talk about a great evening.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent book.  Well researched.  I have read all of Ken Follets books and have enjoyed them all.  I enjoy reading about the different families and their inner conflicts and how they resolve them.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I love Jack Reacher and most of his adventures, but this book was disappointing. There wasn't much action.  The way Reacher thinks things thru' and figures out what's going on with his keen observations was still great,but way too much time in the cars!  I hope that Lee Childs hasn't run out of ideas.  I'm already outraged that he's letting Tom Cruise play Reacher in the movie!!! In every book he tells us how huge and intimidating Reacher is.  Just his mere presents makes people cross the street. He's able to kill men with a single blow to the chest...NOT small, squeaky voiced Tom Cruise. Such mis-casting!!But I digress. Anyway, not his best book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book. And as cliche as it sounds, I couldn't put it down. Thankfully I received it as a gift and I started reading it over the weekend. I was up till early morning until I could reach an acceptable \\"stopping point\\". Only to finish it as soon as I woke up. Can't remember when I read a book that pulled me in so good. Not a challenging read, but very engaging and enjoyable. Different from \\"the rest\\" of the genre. Characters were well developed and interesting. 5 stars all the way! Thank you for this fantastic book!
B007JOM7C4|5.0|Good selection of songs. I expected nothing less from such a talented artist. I recommend this album to anyone who is not a katyphile.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game and gameloft is cool because you can visit other player's towns and send items. Check out [...] and give your name to have your town rated.
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|The film is about life, told in a touching way that isn't sappy. The end gets me all misty everytime.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|I like all Angry Birds, this one is a great game, addictive.  But, they have so many ads!  It's not just the irritation, but I think the ads are battery hogs.  If I play for 30-40 minutes, my Droid battery is almost dead ... that's starting with a full charge!<br /><br />I'd give 5 stars if it weren't for this problem.
B000SXMSJ0|4.0|A very listenable album with lots of great tracks in the inimitable Norah Jones' style. I really enjoy Norah Jones and if you like her you will like this album. The album is a 5* but the mp3 music sounds just a little muddy.  Still a good buy and a solid 4*
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Iv gotta say that the first one of the 3 is by far the best film in the world. I still get goosebumps when morphias says he is the one. The entire series is brilliant and i watch it again and again. When we moved down to Devon i gave all my dvds to charity and decided to start again. The only one i kept was this one. Its just too good to give away......
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent read, I could not put it down, started a little slow but really picked up during their preparation for the mission and the raid itself.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Stimulated by a recent visit to Alaska, I recently reread Jack London's Call of the Wild.  It does bring one into the feeling of Alaska which still uses dogs for transportation in many areas.
B00633PFQC|4.0|The book is easy to read and very good. Sandel makes his point with real examples I never thought before. The bad part is that it is kind of short and the author could had go deepeer.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Cool app. It does tend to crash more than I'd like. Overall it is a good app though. I like the interface.
B003MX97GK|3.0|My sons (one high school, the other middle school age) ordered this video and enjoyed it. I thought it was silly but had some interesting moments, so if you're in the mood for an Owen Wilson movie it's worth a shot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the beds are vary useful when it is relly dark and there are a lot of monsters.  they are also useful at night.
B007H1HQW0|4.0|I purchased this item because I watched a YouTube video by Dan Rojas and he made this project look easy. Great Christmas presents, I thought. It works, but there is definitely practice needed, and it doesn't work perfectly for me more than one time in 4. But- drinking glasses from wine bottles- I always have some in stock to practice on!
B008P1EWIM|1.0|The only thing this app does is display the time of the day.  I can walk outside and see the weather faster than this program works.  maybe it's my location, but I can vouch that no one should waste their money for a clock with a pretty background.  Stay away.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Don't buy this book if you expect Harry Potter. My daughter has read them all and loved them. She's seen all the moves, and we've been to The World of Harry Potter.<br /> I have not read any of the Harry Potter books. I read the sample of Casual Vacancy and bought it because I wanted to read more. J K Rowling is clearly an advocate for children, and reading about the lives of the children in this book was incredibly sad.<br /> I realized once again how little we know about the inner lives of other people, and what makes them behave the way they do. A big reminder of the importance of empathy! I would highly recommend Casual Vacancy.
B0086700CM|3.0|Well there are some things I like and some things I don't. I don't like the lag after a while. Its fine at first when you get it but after you have it for two or three days it starts lagging. And one time I had just turned the app on and I swiped left but it went right. I fixed it by turning the kindle fire off and then back on. I like the game but I don't like the side effects it comes with.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The tension builds expertly as only Lee Child and his hero Jack Reacher can do. The wide open spaces of middle america are a perfect backdrop for what is left behind to what is a possible disastrous future. Great characters developed with beautiful technique and little dialogue. This Jack Reacher story is one of Childs best. But Child also brings to life strong female characters who are not  just window dressing but women with grace, strength and smarts.<br />Read and enjoy. I did in just two sittings.
0525953728|5.0|Great read from a first hand account of a very historic event.  I applaude the former SEAL for making this account possible.
B0086700CM|5.0|A fun game for all ages. Haha Ai needed more words.. lil lil lil lol. lol lol lol lol Smokey caveat!
B008VSIAN2|5.0|Some prog albums take me several spins to really get into, however, this one grabbed me pretty quickly and I found that I enjoyed the album from the get go. A very nice follow up the very solid 2007 Dead Reckoning album, this album may even be a bit better overall. Not only is it consistently good throughout the album, there several exceptionally strong pieces like \\"The Hours\\" and \\"Colophon\\". Highly recommended to any fan of Threshold or just good clean Prog Metal that's emphasizes strong, melodic song writing with great vocals.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|Timeless classic standing the test of time.  Some of the language is archaic, but this does not take away from this excellent picturesque portrayal of life in the early Northwest wilderness.  A must read for any student of literature or American history.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Not as good as the first Fall of the Giants but an excellent portrayal of the times.  Awaiting the third in the trilogy.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Well john carpenter's halloween 1978 october 31st well my vision of michael myers was when dr. loomis tell's the sheriff i met him 15 years ago i was told there was nothing left no conscience no reasone no understanding and even the most rudimentary sense of life or death of good or evil right or wrong i met this six year old child with this blank pale and emotionless face and the blackest eyes the devil's eyes i spent eight years trying to reach and then another seven trying to keep him locked up becaues i realized that what was living behind that boys eyes was purely and simply evil.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Uglies is well written,inventive and has a real statement to make about our current obsession with image and superficial qualities.
B000WP30CI|2.0|I am a huge Dylan but this is a boring and pointless documentary with no real beginning middle and end. It has no real coherency. Skip it...
0385341008|5.0|Loved this book.  Would recommend it to any \\"historical fiction\\" fan. Once you sit down to start the book, it will be hard to put it down.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I have had a Yahoo acct for many years. I enjoy having access to it thru my Kindle Fire. It gives me exactly what I want.
B0018QQQK8|2.0|Too predictable and too sophmoric.  Have seen this plot in a different manner before.  It was not my cup of tea.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It is incredibly long, but it goes by quickly because, let's face it, it's addicting. You'll find yourself saying \\"Whaaaaat?\\" dozens of times. Prepare to have your mind BLOWN.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|It was well written. Just when you thought the end was near another twist to the story comes out.<br />I enjoyed this book very much
B00931JMRE|3.0|La Futura was promoted as ZZ Tops return to the old music we all know and love. Unfortunatly it is not. Instead there are moments of classic ZZ Top, but nothing that can be called a future classic. I've been a fan of this trio since the early 70's, and yes even liked the Sharp dressed man years. But on this cd the boys from Tejas seem to be trying to please everyone, and not themselves. The music is a mix of all the styles they have embraced over the years, but again, nothing stands out.<br />  Its a shame too. I mean the talent is still there. The desire I think is still there. But I think its all about the business now. I dont know, maybe one last pay off. I cant recommend a single song off this cd that will make you say WOW ZZ Top is back!!! And thats too bad, I really wanted too!
B007SGM084|5.0|Very good intense reading. The kind of book you just do not want to put down.Will tell everyone to read.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Great book -it holds your interest to the very end.  Another great book by Lee!<br />Jack Reacher helped to solve another major problem in our society!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I like the story and the characters, but did not like the language. Because of the language I will not get the other books.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This site is kind of addicting. You can get pins from other people as well as suggest your own ideas. It's like shopping but without spending any money. I love it!
B008BM9L72|1.0|There has been so much hype around this book but honestly after reading it I can't comprehend it's popularity. The writing is as basic as a children's book and lacks imagination. The storyline is dull and uninteresting with it's main characters being unmemorable and just plain annoying. Even the 'raunchy' sections of the book are brief and do not hold any form of class or real passion. As a young college student I was expecting to really enjoy this book as it should be easy to relate to but the plot of a 21 year old virgin taking part in what happens is unrealistic in more ways then one. For one, the chances of finding a 21 year old virgin in college are slim to none, and by saying this I do not mean that women today don't respect themselves. This point just makes it very hard for anyone to relate to the story. I am aware that this is fiction and does not have to relate to the real world but in my experience of reading I found it extremely sloppy and unworthy of the praise it has received. I would recommend that if you are a fan of the classics or other forms of educated writing that you don't read this book as it will not satisfy you literary needs. I'm sorry for the negativity but I must tell the truth.
B007TML4EI|4.0|This is well made and enjoyable but it gets hard.  I got to around level 10 or 12 and had to start looking up hints and solutions online because I couldn't figure it out.  I've kind of stopped playing it because there is no hint functionality in the game, and if I'm just plugging in solutions I looked up online, what's the point?  Cool game, and it would not be hard for the developer to add a hint for each level - just show a small portion of a working design.  Maybe you could earn and spend \\"hint points\\" of some kind.  If they did that I would give it 5 stars.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|Not exactly a dull story but far from Lee Child's strongest in plot, characters or dialogue. Left me slightly disappointed - not bad but not up there with the great stories.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this stupid game. I hate how long it takes to get coins though. That said... I can't put it down.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is very challenging. Fun to play and I look forward to playing it alot.<br />Love this game and I will play it again and again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game makes me think.  The game builds creativity.  Focusing on the game is a good stress reducer.  The Kindle Fire is the perfect platform to play games like this.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I like it good compared to most games on here...guess we will see how the rest of the game turns out thumbs up for a free app
B0098VYCCE|2.0|This movie is totally lame. It's use of fantasy was generic and inappropriate. Some of the special effects were great, but did not always make sense, as if it were a visual for visual sake. I was looking forward to the movie and was disappointed.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|his movie rocked I will tell everyone I know about  it. I was  reminded of my childhood times well done!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I purchased this book for my kindle based on some of the reviews. Some people had said it was a really good read with lots of twists. I gave the book three stars becuase it does have lots of twists,  interesting characters, and the writing was good. But it took me till about half way through to really get into it and I was disappointed in the ending.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my GP who is the head of the weight loss clinic at a local hospital. This book explains a complicated bodily process clearly (yes, it turns out this IS a complicated process). I look at food differently now and am looking forward to putting this into practice.  Author is very thorough, logical, and convincing.  I'm inspired!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|So this movie is better than a few other Snow White remakes that came out recently but that isn't saying much. The director obviously wanted Kristen Stewart for the Twilight popularity and a little something on the side (just Google it if you don't know). She isn't real believable in any movie I've seen her in and always seems constipated before she delivers her lines. For some reason Charlize Theron seems a little off here don't know why she is a great actress maybe it was the writing. But that said the rest of the actors are pretty good the dwarfs are awesome and the sets are done very well. So not the worst movie you could watch but certainly not a great one.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Great book as all of John Grisham books are.  I would highly recommend to anyone to read and enjoy.  He is one of my favorite authors.  I can hardly wait for his next book to come out.

B008MEM24S|5.0|Love this app fun and entertaining. Would like to see more like this. One of the few apps i actually purchased.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Not predictable.  good twists and turns.  read the trilogy in a week!  this book made for good discussion over the water cooler with co-worker.  it explains a lot of things that were left out of the movie and gives the story line more substantive meaning.  i enjoyed it
B0099G4Y26|5.0|I am a P!nk fan for many years and I have to say that I love, love, loooove this CD. It has a little bit of everything I love about her music. Some are fun and party like (one of my faves been Walk of Shame) and some are very heart felt and deep (ex. The Great Escape). I listen to this CD everyday at least once or twice and I don't get tired of it.
B000002IZ4|5.0|Excellent album;It proved to me they would become one of the most versitile rock bands in the history of music! And to listen to them today proves that. 20 years later they still sound great! There are lots of bands who wish they still rocked like these guys!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Best new show that I have seen.  Great acting, writing.  Can't wait to see what happens in Season 2.<br />Love the characters!  Carrie is the best.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Good read and good follow up to the previous book in the trilogy. I am looking forward to the third book
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this came is very addictive fun and a great time killer. I wish u could play some mini games or something to earn more coins quicker.
B000W178XO|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of his and it has made me the man I am today. Your a god johnny and the world is a sad place without you in it!
B00973CGXK|5.0|I was a slight fan until I heard this cd. Life changing sound. Every song resonates in the mind and heart and creates a picture. Beauty, pain, love and so much more are expressed through music. Buy this cd...
B004X4QW42|5.0|This was better than the first.  Based on a true story, this has got to be one of the best Chinese Martial Arts films.  It was completely English dubbed, but in Divx the subtitles are available.  I highly recommend both Ip Man 1 and 2.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I didn't want to start this book because I knew that I wouldn't be able to stop reading it and that is exactly what happened! It was great! I can not wait to read Entwined In You! December 31 can't get here fast enough! Thank you Sylvia Day for letting us into Eva and Gideon's lives!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I already own The West Wing, and my friend, Valerie, always said that I had to leave it to her \\"in my will.\\"  I made a mental note of the fact that if I ever foound the series at a really good price, it would be the perfect gift for her.  I check the Today's Deals to see what is being offerred, and I was thrilled to find the complete series at a fabulous price.  I immediately ordered it and had it sent to her.  She was speechless (a really difficult thing to achieve.)  I told her that I was all set for presents for her for quite a few years, and she agreed.  Thank you for making my friend's day!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this site, so many great ideas and recipes to find and save here. Don't know when I needed my cookbook last,  I've been trying so many I have found here!
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I knew I was going to love at least three songs on the album, but was caught off guard by loving the whole thing! Lots of variety, and I'm  a lyrics girl so totally happy there.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Great acting and production with a distinctively British point of view. A nice look at the culture differences between the West and India, handled in an amusing but effective and sensitive way. So good we saw it twice!
B00943SQCI|1.0|if you watch this as a movie it's okay that start shadows completely wrong has no some lunch the original movie or TV series
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Most Reacher books are balanced and interesting from start to finish. This one falls well short. Interesting start and then unbelieveable slaughter ending. Too bad.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|An economist who tells it like it is and does not tailor his opion for profit!,like Standard and Poors!The sad part of it is his wisdom will be lost in the static of the greedy.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This is another typical Jack Reacher adventure, which is exactly what I want when I pick up a 'Reacher Novel.'  Great, great story telling, Lee Child has been my favorite author for years now, loved it!
B0084BM7GW|5.0|Saw them in Durham NC on this tour and the DVD does not disappoint. Good mix of old and new songs sung with great energy. Really enjoyed the concert and this DVD. Able to show friends that did not go and see them live, what they missed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the very best site. Works great on my Fire. Easy to navigate and fun to use. You must try it!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I play this game just about daily and enjoy every bit of it. Just wish there were bigger puzzle options.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Shadow of the Wind was a masterfully written book.  It started out a bit confusing but as the story progressed all the pieces fit together like a beautiful puzzle.  The story had elements of history, intrigue, romance, mystery, passion and brutality all weaved together into an intriguing story.  A must read!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed it....a few twists and turns always makes a good book in my opinion. It delves into the dark side of us all, well at least every one but me. :)
B002TLSSXO|4.0|Perfect?? No...but then, what is? Yes they will melt if YOU put them in contact with things you shouldn't! I use them ONLY with my non-stick cookware! I only made the mistake of using with my favorite iron skillet one time...I used a fine nail file to smooth out the edge and have had NO OTHER PROBLEM!I have RA and the larger handles are easier for me to grip, I think they are pretty and I don't leave them full of food so they sit pretty well like they are supposed to! I have really enjoyed my set and would recommend them to my friends! Some of the other utensils for non-stick pans that I have had were quite flexible and would bend instead of lift or stir but these have never failed me!
B008XFAT7S|5.0|Lots of action... Great movie - fighting etc... What else can I say. Just see the movie... Thanks for allowing me to review...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|When the movie comes out I am sure that it can't be as good as the book. Loved all three.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|So good. This book is great if you are into fantasy novels for anyone who has read Name of the Wind or the Wise Mans Fear this is as good if not better than those.  Can't wait for the second book!
B005KR6OBM|5.0|My wife got me started on this series and now I am hooked like sooooo many other fans of this show. We also got season five and are now getting up to speed on the shows we missed. \\"Bazinga!\\"
B008C1O8CA|3.0|I might as well start with the positive. \\"Oh Love\\" is an excellent song and when I first heard it on the radio a couple of months back I had high hopes for the first album of the trilogy.  Not so. I was a bit underwhelmed on the first listen so I let it sit for a week or so and came back to it.  Unfortunately, the second listen didnt find much improvement. \\"Oh Love\\" keeps getting better and \\"Stay the Night,\\" \\"Carpe Diem,\\" Sweet 16\\" and \\"Rusty James\\" are decent pop songs but the rest are forgettable and laden with gratuitous f-bombs.  I have no problem with a few well-timed expletives but overuse seems to indicate that an artist is running out of more clever ideas.  I heartily agree with another reviewer who labels Uno as a return to 2000 or even a less entertaining Foxboro Hot Tubs disc.  I am a long-time Green Day fan and will check out the next installment of the trilogy, this time with some apprehension. Without \\"Oh Love,\\" 2 stars.
0062011847|5.0|My son-in-law enjoys reading Terry Pratchett books and is always keen to read the latest one. This makes it really easy to choose him a  gift for Christmas and birthdays. He and my daughter live in the States and I live in the UK. It costs a small fortune to mail books to the US from the UK so I always order his gift from Amazon.com.He really enjoyed reading 'Snuff and recommends it.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I enjoy reading Ken Follett and the first of the trilogy was really a good read.  This one was OK but not up to the high standards of the first.  The few families of the book were substantial involved in virtually every key event of WWII, a reach to say the least.  Will I read the third book, yes, and I look forward to it, but hope it is more in keeping with the first book....
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This man is every woman's dream of a partner. He so adored her. I know he went overboard but nothing's perfect. If there is a movie made I think the Rachael McAdams would play a perfect Ana but I don't know if she would do everything that the book calls for. lol
B002L9PQGG|3.0|That the vinyl is better than the other formats is no big surprise since sonically those versions (CD & MP3) suck.  True, this is lo-fi & an homage to the sound of 60s.  This set is mastered by Doug Sax, so likely it's as good as it can get.  The vinyl does still sound compressed though, I imagine because the recording is, not the mastering per se.  There is some greater detail & separation thankfully.  Big bottom end. The vinyl is not quiet, but I have yet to give it a thorough cleaning.
B00846REIS|5.0|It wasn't as good as the 50 Shades Trilogy, but well worth reading.<br />This book is worth reading again and again.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Maybe not enough action, but a very readable Reacher novel.  Just don't read \\"Mad River\\" about the same time.  Unless you like wandering around in a car.  I'll still grab every Reacher novel that comes out, but this isn't Lee's best.  CAN YOU IMAGINE SHORT TOM CRUISE PLAYING REACHER????
B007IXWL2C|5.0|ALL THREE BOOKS WERE VERY GOOD QAND WELL WRITTEN DIDN'T KNOW I  KNEW SO LITTLE ABOUT THE BOOK SUBJECT. A COMPELLING LOVE STORY WITH A WONDERFULL ENDING.
B00622B3MY|4.0|My grandsons love both Cars movies.  I prefer the first one to this one because I like the theme of caring about others more than winning and the fact there is little violence.  However, both are fun to watch.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher is the usual cool character. Another read in one sitting book.<br />Can't wait to see what happens during the next segment of the road trip east.<br />Lee Child has done an excellent job with the literary testosterone saga series
B007TMON8M|2.0|The instructions bite, the game is just okay. I gave it a few days of play and then uninstalled. It isn't the worst game I ever played, but that's the best thing I can say about it.
B00887490Y|2.0|I watched this movie the other night. And the only time I jumped is when the dog jumped out from the truck when she open the door. Wow, I will have to say this movie sucked badly. She was the tall man it wasn't a really good story line. This movie could have been 10 times better a waist of my time and money.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I cannot wait for the last book.  I am sooo in love with this series and do not want it to end!!  I do have to say it took me one day to read and then i had to re-read again just to make sure i didnt miss anything.  If you have read anything by Sylvia Day you will absolutely love this
B003V40SGS|2.0|I thought that this movie had a lot of potential.  Unfortunately it didn't seem to really live up to any of it.<br /><br />There were certainly a few good moments, but the movie certainly lacked action.  It moved far too slowly.  There were certainly \\"some\\" special effects but it could have used more.  This statement is made taking into account the fact that the film was made in the days before computer-generated effects became as sophisticated as they are today.<br /><br />Overall, yeah, I'm glad that I saw it, but I'm certainly in no hurry to watch it again.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Blew me away!  Everything I needed plus some - great app!  We live in a coastal flood area so \\"wet feet\\" depend on the lunar cycle, high tides and wind - this completely fills our needs for keeping track of the lunar cycle.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This book is not nearly as concise as the first book.  The story seems to go on and on without getting anywhere.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|At first I had a hard time getting into this book, but now I am close to the end and am having a hard time putting it down.  Enjoyed it.
B0098VXCR0|1.0|Too much hype, cheap visual effects.  Equal to a B rated movie, expected more but was very disappointed.  It seemed like they ran out of ideas midway through movie and you could guess what would come next.  No twist or surprises,
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a GREAT game and helps that it's an easy game to play when your tired and just want to relax.  Glad that I run out of coins or I could see myself playing for a lot longer.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this app! I was really happy when it came out for Kindle Fire! That ment no more trying to pin things on the website! It works great and I'm obsessed!(:
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is a great game because...there is a lot of money.I like lots of money.I wish all the money was mine.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to every fan of the hunger games. I had a hard time putting it down. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This little app is a delight to use.  The developers have added some nice features that you don't expect to find on a simple digital calculator - such as retention of entries. The large size of the display is ideal - no fumbling around, accidentally touching the wrong numbers as with a lot of smaller digital products that are too small for fingers.  My only question is - when will Apple pick  this up for the i-things?
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Maroon Five just keeps getting better and better in my opinion. I Love this album and all those Maroon five harmonies.
B005ES0YRM|4.0|This order came in extremely fast, even to an address overseas.  They were exactly what I was looking for, comfortable, easy to slip on and off and durable for repeated trips back and forth across gravel.  I will definitely wear these out and then buy another pair.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|It would not print with the Brother MFC-490cw series printer.Tried several times and could not get it to connect even though it is a wireless printer and scanner.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Easily one of the greatest books I have ever read.  Within a month's time I read this Do the Work and Turning Pro twice.  I highly recommend it for anyone who is an inspiring artist or writer.
B008J05EL8|1.0|As everyone else has clearly stated... charging an additional fee for something that should already be included in the software that we have already purchased is a ripoff.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|There is so much to say about this album, but once I received it, I realized I was listening to it over and over again without getting bored or sick of it.  Their music is so encompassing and has such a great variety that you'll be able to listen to this over and over.  Every track induces peace, while at the same time is a celebration of life and nature.  They do such a great job, are so talented and are truly amazing people themselves.  You won't regret this album at all. In addition to that, their music has served to thousands of young people love, appreciate and become more interested in classical and musical development.  Their \\"coolness\\" mixed with popular and classical songs do exactly that.
B0071BGOJC|2.0|To start with, I must say that Mr Follett is one of my favourite authors. I was so looking forward to Part 2 of this trioloy - having thoroughly enjoyed reading Part 1 and loving the characters and the history. I am seriously wondering whether Mr Follett actually wrote this book himself - many parts certainly do not compare in style to Part 1. To be honest, I did not finish it and most likely never will. I will definitely not buy Part 3. It was a real disappointment.
1400052181|4.0|First thanks so much to the author for bringing Henrietta Lacks and her family into the public scope. This was a story that begged to be told for so long - I'm grateful for learning so much about the science behind it as well. I had no idea - it is truly staggering the effect HeLa has had on the world. The oral history of the Lacks family was a fantastic read and my heart felt broken from the middle of the book to the end. This one has been on my to-read list for a long time - I'm so glad I finally got to it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|well i really enjoy solitaire so having it on my kindle is very convenient. it has normal settings just like the computer version. if you like solitaire its a great app to get
B0052AC8C6|4.0|The visuals are absolutely outstanding. The plot is a little long but the fantastic animation is worth even the burgeoning scenes that tend to run a little long here and there. Overall, I would watch this movie again on a large, large screen just because the unbelievable animation was jaw dropping.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the greatest idea site on the internet. One great idea after another. Literally has ideas and help for just about anything that may interest you. I literally lose track of time when I get on Pinterest. I recommend it to everyone I know.
B008V0OLOW|4.0|Oh please! - there's more musicality in any three notes of Diana Krall than 95% of the pop music out there today. D.K. just can't win! For jazz musicians, she's not jazz enough! For those who love her overly orchestrated discs produced by Tommy La Puma, how dare she try something different! For those who like her singing, she's a lousy piano player. For those like her piano chops, she's a lousy singer. Enough already.<br /><br />Enough of the comparisons to Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Billie Holiday, Julie London, Peggy Lee (who she DOES sound a little bit like) - she isn't any of those people. She's Diana Krall. Learn to accept her on her own terms or just walk away. Frankly, I applaud her for doing just that - walking away - from the endless Tommy La Puma projects with their ridiculously overgrown string arrangements. For those who think she can't play the piano, listen to her intro. to \\"Devil May Care\\" from her \\"Live in Paris\\" disc. Also, check out her piano chops on \\"All For You - Tribute to the Nat King Cole Trio\\", which is probably still her best studio album to date.  Trust me, the woman can play. I like this disc. The last four cuts on the Deluxe Edition show that she can still play the piano quite well.<br /><br />Sure, \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" isn't going to set the world on fire. But it's a nice departure, and I enjoy the rather more authentic accompaniments that go along with each song. Perhaps it might have worked better if, for a more intimate album such as this one, it had been recorded 'live'. But I just accept it for what it is. I like the tunes, I like her singing (even if it lacks the suffering of a Billie Holiday) and I like the authentic sounding guitars. Whether Elvis Costello has been a bad influence on her Diana Krall is, quite frankly, her own affair. Let her figure that out for herself if that's the case.<br /><br />But to find out if \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" is for you or not, just listen to the generous samples that Amazon has provided above. That should be thedeciding factor, and not all the endless bantering back-and-forth about who D.K. is or isn't. Can we all at least agree on that much?
B007GCY8FS|2.0|After reading all of the Jack Reacher series I found this one to be unfortunately way below par.I get the feeling that Lee Child has either run out of ideas or is simply bored with Jack Reacher. I am very sorry because for years I really looked forward to the new book coming out and up till now was always at least sufficiently satisfied.My hope is that he either finds some true inspiration or moves on to something else.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|It stands alone as a mystery novel, but true fans of 'CASTLE' on TV, (like myself) will love finding the references from the show used in the book. Every other page has an \\"Oh yeah, I remember that\\" moment. Just as fast and funny as the show but the action and suspense sequences are even better than TV.
B000IK8JTG|3.0|keeping in mind that cathy was 18 when she died, it was totally wrong - the actors were too old for the parts.<br /><br />the writing was good and kept in line with the book. fiennes did an understated, malevolent heathcliff. costuming and location were good. overall i like the tom hardy version better.
B008KNZ4LO|4.0|This movie showcases some of the most violent, nonstop martial arts action scenes ever put on screen. The plot is simple but with this much action and action done so well, the plot is almost immaterial. It is a full faced demonstration of how martial arts action should be seen on screen. There are a couple of surprises in the plot that make up for its simplicity. Overall, I give this film 4 stars because of its simple straightforward course but if it had been a little more cleverly worked up, it could easily have gotten 5 stars because the action was just that sensational. It was made in Indonesia and has subtitles but for those who can read, it is not a detriment at all. It illustrates how good it is to watch foreign films and how their ideas of violence and action effect the constitution of the overall movie. See it. You will be glad you did.
B0098VXMNE|4.0|This 2nd season or the continuation of the Spartacus Saga is not as good as the 1st season.<br />Being the fact it starts Very Slowly and builds and builds to an Incredible Ending.<br />I did however enjoy it very much so, especially the last 3 episodes. They caught me off guard for what happened at the end and I do so like it when that happens. Regular TV is Sooo Predictable and this threw a Huge Curveball, I Love That!<br />I will be patiently waiting for Season 3 I assure you!!!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Disappointment after reading 1st 2 books. Expected more. Second book the best. I would recommend the series to others. Friends have made same statement to me about Mocking Jay. Many thought the second book was the best????
B004T5R2HQ|4.0|Did not work when i installed it.  Eventually figured out this is version 1.1,  had to update to 1.5 before it would work correctly.  Update not available through amazon apps, had to get from google play.  The full version license transferred and it works great now.  Trim document  is awesome,even removes keystone from documents.
B009CPRYG2|5.0|I thought this was a nice new take on Batman and yes I know it has been done in the comics before. I look forward to part two of this story and this will be one movie I watch over and over again.<br /><br />I know that some people might not like seeing their hero older and weaker cause of his age, but I think it adds a new level to his story and shows that he is just a normal man who has worked hard to be the best he can be.
B0013811CE|3.0|Like my review of the pilot... Great acting, excellent dialogue... Very disturbing plot line about a high school science teacher who runs a meth lab. Doesn't improve my self image or personal happiness to watch this story.
B006022HK8|4.0|I always enjoy Keith Urban music and the melody.  I have this CD and play it frequently.  Easy to listen to music and reminds me of summertime.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a very good read. I do not see the controversy involved, he sounds like a very  loyal soldier..You want to read this
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Even though I'm 54... this book made me cry.  I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end.<br />Excellent read.
B0090EIILU|4.0|The film is an absolutely a belly laugh. In keeping with Sacha Cohen's work, it is totally politically incorrect. The humor is at times juvenile. Taking the entire film into consideration I found it not only entertaining but contains a message quite poignant ...
B0098VXE50|3.0|This movie is not the worst I have seen, but the lead actress was some of the worse acting I have every seen before and just killed the movie for me. With a different lead this could have been a great movie.
B0012QTT4O|3.0|I really wasn't expecting to like this show. The acting was so outstanding that the story captured me. I still have a hard time enjoying a series about a science teacher who burns meth with his student. I feel uncomfortable after watching it.  They've certainly given him a lot of reasons to do this. One big reason not to: it will hurt, even kill, other people.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The author meticulously weaves the complexity of characters in this heart-wrenching, suspenseful novel. Parents and non-parents alike with be greedily turning pages to see what happens to Jacob.  I highly recommend it.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|It's a great series, due to the leading actors being completely awesome and winning all kinds of Emmy awards for their trouble.  When I first heard about the series I didn't want to watch it because I feared it would be too much like \\"24\\" - all about the terror and heroics, not about the people - and this show couldn't be farther from that.  It's grounded and human.  The episodes craft complex stories and characters that pull you through the series and leave you hanging on every word and face-palming at each missed connection.  I can't wait to see what the second season holds!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Fun game, no problem running on Kindle Fire<br />The only downside is the same as most free games, the number of free coins does not allow you to play long before you need to wait unless you are actually crazy enough to buy coins that have no value to play a game.
B008XG1X18|4.0|pinterest is fun. it crashes a lot though! At least daily I get a error message stating the program is not responding and asks if I want to force close or wait.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Page turner, great book! I just love Reacher. I need to read more of these books.Lee Child is a great author.
B004PYWRQC|2.0|Mildly interesting, mostly due to the fantasy elements and Depp's performance.  But the story line just barely holds your attention, and the ending falls totally flat.
B006VREN86|5.0|This show was very nicely done and greatly enjoyable!  i love productions set in this period and like to see them authentically done.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|The best book I've read since Kate Atkinson's \\"Behind the Scenes at the Museum.\\"  The characters are richly developed and compelling, with each chapter devoted to a different character.  Minor players in one chapter appear later as the central figure in another, and the fate of some characters is dropped into our laps as almost a casual aside, a frisson of mortality.  It's about memory and fate, about the way we plan our lives, the way our lives are planned for us, and the way life sometimes just happens to us.  It's about the way we treat people now, and how those connections might come back to bless or haunt us later.  I hated to see it end.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I love the Jack Reacher novels but I have to say this one I liked the least.  I can't put my finger on specific's , it just didn't hold me like usual.
B008Y1RTUG|2.0|I found myself falling asleep in the this boring film. It was too dark and you need a really need a dark room and time to focus your eyes.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is not only a lesson on how to love efficiently, its a way of life. Read it and believe it. It will bust your soul wide open.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I hate writing a review that gives things away.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is a novel that is gritty with adult themes. I am not sure readers younger than 35 will really understand this novel. These themes are not over done or tacky, but it takes a bit to get over Fairbrother's death and how it impacts each character as well as the council. I was sucked in by the 4th or 5th chapter, but had I read this when I was 30 I probably would have set it aside. That being said this is a story of codependency, drugs, methadone, teenagers attempting to find themselves and adults that have lost themselves, as well as their values and morals having been twisted by obligation and the silly useless things we tell ourselves we HAVE to do. It is also a story of how they find their way back.<br /><br />Yes, there are teenagers having sex and about 5 pages of a mad mans ramblings about what IF he was party to pedophilia and the suggestion of it later, but I have to applaud writers who write about reality and not silly trumped up fantasies. There are also some really angry wives, deluded characters, and of course the old hens of the town who do nothing but gossip.<br /><br />I really appreciated Rowling's use of vocabulary and language in this novel. It is not written for the average reader but someone who is a bit of a wordaphiliac and can appreciate the usage of an archaic word in a modern format. I am so glad that Rowling has made a departure from children's books. I loved HP, but it was time to move on. And now that she has I cannot wait for the next adult novel.<br /><br />Well Done!
B000FVE3BG|5.0|I was worried about quality while I was ordering, I though $90 was too cheap for such a pretty watch. When I received it I was so happy to find the watch to be of great craftsmanship and at a great price. I would definitely order again.
B00884GR0W|1.0|minecraft is so much better than blockstory go to 4shared.com and download minecraft pocket edition. get minecraft or at least mooncraft
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. It is very addicting. I have tried a few things and it has been a fun learning experience.
0312641893|5.0|This book was incredible. I read it in one sitting, and nearly cried at the end (out of frustration). I'm dying for the next one now. Just, ohmygosh, I love fairy tale retellings, and this was certainly no different. I never much cared for Cinderella, but I loved Marissa Meyer's Cinder. I just... WOW.    With my incoherent babble out of the way, I'll talk about the plot. It starts off with Cinder, a mechanic, working at her booth, where she fixes things mechanical-like. Prince Kai comes and asks her to fix his android, and she agrees to, but it might take her a while. She goes home, and we meet her step family (not so nice, except for Peony). Then Peony gets sick with this plague, Peony's momma (Cinder's stepmother) goes a little off her rocker and gives Cinder away to be tested on with this plague. And then there's lots of interesting discoveries about herself and the people she thought she knew. And there's some romance, and intergalactic threats of war. And lots of sci-fi things (cyborgs, androids, aliens, ya know). It's all threaded into the classic tale of Cinderella (except this Cinder is kick-butt). It's amazing. I love the part her being cyborg plays into everything (Cinderella was a servant, and therefore looked down upon. Cinder is a cyborg, and therefore looked down upon). Marissa Meyer also put quotes from the original Cinderella before each \\"section\\" of the book, and they let us know what that part would correlate to, and that was really neat.    I adored Cinder. Like, she was the princess who didn't need to be saved from her tower. She could hold her own in the world, and against those who were cruel to her. She was resourceful, and kind, and intelligent, and awesome. And she did everything she could to help those who were important to her. Gosh, she was just such a great heroine. And then there was Prince Kai. He was a little arrogant, but I liked it. He was caring and kind, and handsome. He kind of just an all around good guy. And then there's this doctor guy, Dr. Erland. And he is so awesome. He's a little loony, but it works for him. He was like the cool grandpa we all wish we had.    I loved the cover. A lot. It's so different from what I've seen recently, and it's gorgeous. It's what originally drew me to the book. I love the shoe and the gears you can see through the leg and I even love the font of the title. It's all just so pretty! And it does cast the air of Cinderella, and that's so neat.    So yeah, 5 stars because it was awesome. This is another one of those books that I believe all literate people should read. It was fascinating and gorgeous and amazing. Now I need Scarlet!!!

B004DTXJ4S|3.0|Made a decent action movie that's not as good as the previous movies.  It started well but just didn't feel like it followed through.  The ending made it feel like the movie is just a stepping stone in the series.  The movie only had one purpose that happens in the beginning of the movie.
B007TMON8M|4.0|I was very impressed at how much actual physics went into the game! Nice challenge! Much more skill required than for angry birds or fruit ninja, for sure!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I won't provide a synopsis because I don't want to provide spoilers and I think others have done this better than I would.  This is a story that you will find yourself thinking about 6 months, a year, or even more after reading it.  My husband and I both read the Wool Omnibus and the prequel three to six months ago and we still find ourselves discussing it.  We hope there will be additional Wool stories as we were drawn into the author's world and still have unanswered questions.  I don't think the author intended this to become a series, however the world that Hugh Howey created is different enough from other post apocalypse world stories that readers want to know more about this one and the people in it.
0345803485|3.0|ok, maybe you don't want to read my honest opinion on Fifty Shades of Grey, especially if you have heard rare reviews about how good it is..<br />Cliched story, when you reach my age, you have read plenty of them around. One that comes to mind might be: \\"The Story of O\\", the one of \\"Tess\\" also, of course, since it is mentioned in this book. Young 19 something, physically a virgin but with the intelligence of an independent knowledgeable woman, falls in love with the dark and hypnotic look of multi millionaire 23 something... sounds familiar? Read on... Sado maso sex if there is one (I predict adult toys are making a killing this year). Romantic enough to keep you reading, about this loving female believing (and succeeding) that her unconditional love for this most deranged man will help him change (which it does against all odds). Ok, we're in lalaland and hopeful thinking, but maybe the sex scenes are what makes this series so contemporary.<br />Young or not so young wives reading this tale, be warned. if you don't find find sexual excitement and complain your husband doesn't send you every time to 7th Heaven during your escapades in bed, do not rush to any dark character to find this thrill... it happens only in books!!! I repeat, it happens only in books!!! No man can compare to this hunk character, not in real life at least.<br />To think a movie is planned out of this series, good luck to the director for the script! what difference will it be between porn and love story? that other cultures not used to media covering and tv series depicting this kind of moral loss can consider America and its authors evil inspired or driven does not surprise me anymore (and yet, i am considered very very open and allowing)...<br />If you're young and want to keep your love life unhurt, please, please, please, do not try to attract this kind of story and men into your life! some nights of sexual lure can lead to decades of nightmares and loss of self respect.<br />hope the sexual crime rate is not going to go higher after millions of women get enthralled in these stories of pure sexual bliss... the line between pleasure and pain (leading to death) is soooooo fine...<br />Fifty Shades is definitely a moral compass about our 21st century. Great millions to be made for its author, great wrecks in lots of lives, good luck to psychologists, family counselors and police...al crime rate is not going to go higher after millions of women get enthralled in these stories of pure sexual bliss... the line between pleasure and pain (leading to death) is soooooo fine...<br />Fifty Shades is definitely a moral compass about our 21st century.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love it. That's exactly what I need it . Mind off from the stress. Easy games and some challenging also wth big veriety of it. Thank you.
B007TMON8M|1.0|This was just a basic game (maybe even dumb). I was hoping my daughter could actually learn something about physics. The search continues.
B009AI5ABC|5.0|So, yeah, as the title implies, Battle Born will not be replacing Hot Fuss as my favorite Killers album.<br /><br />HOWEVER, that does not in anyway take away from how fantastic this album is.  I like the fact that The Killers have experimented with their sound/style a bit in a few songs, but that the majority of the albums still sounds like THEM.  A lot of people really rave about \\"Runaways\\" - which is definitely a good song - but I'd have to say my favorites on the album are \\"The Way It Was\\" (which is earnest and, I think, sounds the most like THE KILLERS), \\"Deadlines and Commitments,\\" and \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" (which has GREAT rhythm).  The title song, \\"Battle Born\\" is also excellent.  I think the weakest song on the album is \\"Heart of a Girl.\\"<br /><br />All in all, I think all Killers fans should love this album, and I wouldn't be surprised if it brought in some new fans as well.  It is EXCELLENT and well worth buying.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Clockwork Angels is Rush's first full concept album (2112 and the like were only side-long concepts). This is a very fun album, and well worth picking up. The story is strong, but loose enough that the songs stand on their own. Highlights are Clockwork Angels, The Anarchist, The Wreckers, and especially The Garden. This album is one of their best and gets pretty consistent rotation on my music player, I think you will enjoy it too.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Gives an account of not just the story of the mission but the actions which took place to train our Navy Seals.  Very informative.  Good easy read.
B002XSP16A|5.0|I can not believe how wonderful this is.  I love every song on it which is usually rare on a full cd.  I am now a huge fan of Susan Boyle.  Her music just calms me and puts me in a happy place.  It's ethereal almost.  I hope she makes many more albums.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy this app tremendously. I literally use it every day. My church shares our lessons/sermons using the live section. If I can't make it to church church makes it to me. My favorite feature is the Bible reading plans by topic. The daily reminders and the note portion make it so easy to read His Word and then journal how it is alive in my life.  I also love the audio Bible. Use it via Bluetooth in the car and at home. It's FREE. Give it a try.

B006LSZECO|1.0|The novel dragged on until the end.  When I finally got to the end through many twists and turns, I learned how very self-centered and manipulative the \\"girl\\" turns out to be.  I like a novel much better when I admire the main character.

0767802470|5.0|I first saw this movie in a theater. I was a serving Navy officer. I knew a little about its history. I was on the edge of my seat beginning to end. I remember sweating in a fully air-conditioned movie house. I do not remember reading the captions but I do not know German. This movie is that powerful.<br /><br />The background of this movie is important to understand. This movie is a very cut down version of a 6 hour mini series made for the German television. It is a fictionalized account of events as experienced by its author: novelist Lothar-Gunther Buchheim.<br />He had served as a writer for the WWII German Army Signal magazine. As such he rode in a German U Boat and originaly wrote a propaganda version of his experience.<br /><br />His later book and the mini series were highly controversial in Germany. Some thought it honored the Nazis and should have been illegal under German law.<br /><br />My points:<br />1.The back story to this movie is important.<br />2.It is based on first person experience - now absent the propaganda.<br />3.The movie is about 1/3 of what the writer and director originally produced and broadcast.<br /><br />Plot summery:<br /> World War II has reached a turning point for the German U Boat Navy. Each new mission is undertaken at a higher risk and with less chance to score hits. Crews are beginning to feel the strain. An army war correspondent is assigned to go on patrol with one of the more successful u-boats. His assignment is to write about his experience.<br />Historical note: The loss rate among German Submariners in WWII was so high that sailors referred to U-Boats as Iron Coffins<br />We share his experience. Like him we cannot know or understand everything we see, but we cannot help but understand what the experience feels like.<br /><br />On this mission, all does not go well.<br /><br />This is not a pro Nazi movie. It is neither pro nor anti-war. Fundamentally it is not a movie about submarines.<br /><br />This is what happens to any dedicated, decent human when you send him to war.<br />At some level we understand that war means that some people will be killed or physically injured. We are beginning to understand that some will experience psychological harm. This movie is about the boredom, the terror and the sum total personal weight of being in combat.<br /><br />It is left to you to decide if and when war is necessary. This movie asks that you understand what you are doing to people when you make that decision.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this crew is not politically motivated. They are not interested in the Nazis. In fact the one officer who is most deeply committed to the Nazi cause is a common object of derision. In the book, this officer suffers a case of the crabs so severe as to have them crawling visibly in his eyebrows.<br />I suspect that this is something of a white-wash of the non SS portion of the German military. My experience of folks in uniform is that they tend to be politically to the right. German antisemitism, anti-Slavic feelings and other extreme attitudes exploited by the Nazis were endemic in the total German population of that period. The movie however has no praise for any politics. Politics is not what this movie is about.<br /><br />Other Reviews expressed technical issues with this print. I did not have any technical problems.<br />Other reviews were not happy with the dubbing or the captions. I find this movie so involving that the translations/dubbing become subordinate to the feel, the experience and the emotions of this movie. Perhaps if I understood German I might feel slighted by the text.<br /><br />At some point this move should grab you. At that point it is about the totality of the experience and words tend to carry less meaning.<br /><br />This is not just a great movie, it is an important movies to any dedicated, decent human when you send him to war.<br />At some level we understand that war means that some people will be killed or physically injured.

B008G12ERC|5.0|I pre-ordered this as soon as I heard Madness on the radio. Once it shipped, it came the very next day!  I was so happy!  I got this on Wednesday and it's literally all I listen to now.  Probably my favorite Muse album!  Love love love!!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read all 3 books to see what the hype was all about.  Other than the pure shock factor, I thought these were very boring and poorly written.  This story could have easily been condensed into one book.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|i CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THIS ERMEHGERD I LOVE IT AND SO SHOULD YOU SO JUST BUY IT ALREADY WOULD YEAH?
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I found this book laborious.  Towards the middle of the book I started skipping around trying to find something different or a new twist. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like stereotype characters and a story that drags. The actual concept of a time keeper was unique but the book didn't honor it.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|i downloaded this app but have not been able to get it to work.<br />it does not appear to be compatible with all printers, including mine.<br />The canon mx892 was not on the list of printers for printbot.
B004D7GU3M|5.0|Despite what other reviews have been saying about the LP version I Love it, without a doubt one of the better vinyl purchases I have made, and as I see it it's better to buy now rather than when its $200+. It has superb audio clarity, and not only is it a collectors item but one of the best Kanye albums of all time... of all time!.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Story was very nice travis falls for abby without realizing it. Abby insist that travis is not the kind of person she can end up with. Bringing up childhood issues from father again. I can't wait till travis side of the story is told in walking disaster.
B001GCZN12|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of live albums, preferring to hear music free of crowd noises and interruptions, but Black Symphony is an extreme exception for me.  The pure energy resonating from this concert is extraordinary, the recording is superb, and Within Temptation, in my opinion, performs these live songs with such passion and perfection that it leaves their studio albums in the dust.  I have always loved Within Temptation's music, but I had never considered traveling to Europe to hear them in concert.  Now I'm longing to to go, to see and hear this group perform.  Listening to this album fills me with life and energy, and I can't count the number of times I've now listened to it.  I give Black Symphony my highest recommendation!
B008WHQZJI|5.0|What can I say? If you are a PSB fan, you will love this latest album. It contained all new material and I personally found only one song on it that didn't appeal to me.

1400052181|4.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already?  Yes, I was fascinated to learn about the history of cell research.  Yes, I found the moral, ethical, and psychological implications of cell research compelling.  But I think what really stood out for me - the thing I'll remember most about the book - is how it gave voice to a class of Americans that are shockingly unrepresented in literature.  Deborah and the other relatives of  Henrietta Lacks are members of a largely \\"forgotten\\" class here in the U.S. - tragically under/uneducated, superstitious, plagued with physical and mental illness, trapped in a cycle of dependency on social safety nets that provide for basic needs without providing resources to help people better their condition.  It may be tempting to be frustrated by Deborah's irrational thinking, her superstition, her ignorance, her wild swings of mood - but her love for her family, her compassion for others, and her humanity remind us that she is \\"us\\" - or the \\"us\\" most of us would be if we'd been subject to the same psychological and socioeconomic upbringing as she and her family members.<br /><br />For me, the book is less about the ethics of cell research than the ethics of throwing \\"services\\" - health care, food stamps, medicare - at our forgotten class and considering our job as a society \\"done\\".  Until we ensure that citizens of the U.S. receive an adequate education, I'm not sure we can ever achieve true \\"informed consent.\\"<br /><br />Whoops!  Didn't mean to preach - just meant to say that, in my opinion, the popularity of the book is probably largely due to the fact that it works on so many levels.  Unlike Poisoner's Bible, Disappearing Spoon, or Devil in the White City - other non-fiction works that have been built around stories of scientific progress - this book has real humans, and real humanity, at its heart.  Long after I've forgotten everything I just learned about Hayfield Limits and telomeres, I'll remember Deborah and her struggle to be treated with dignity and humanity by a society that owes her mother so much.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Want to know what if feels like to live in India? This is the novel for you. A compelling narrative about how a foreigner adapts and lives and learns in this huge mash up of a civilization. You will learn a lot about this country, its crazy quilt of religions, its huge contrasts between rich and poor, but mostly the message that comes through so clearly is that the most important aspect of a person's life is the personal relationships one develops. A truly fine novel and well worth reading.

0375842209|4.0|It's going to be challenging to write this review because I'm not sure through which \\"lens\\" through which to describe it.  As a life-long reader with a penchant for challenging fiction, should I review Book Thief as a work of adult literature; or, in my role as a middle school English teacher, should I address its merits as a tool for teaching literature to teens?  As it happens, this book wholly succeeds on both levels.<br /><br />The key is that Book Thief possesses much more depth than usually found in literature marketed to teens. The characters are complex and deeply realized.  The text is stuffed with imagery, personification, extended metaphors/allegories (Max's stories), irony (the use of Mein Kampf in aiding Max's escape), and symbolism (those books!!).  Finally, the author's voice is vivid, lyric, and utterly compelling.  Speaking of which ...<br /><br />Much has been made of the author's choice of Death as the narrator.  I gather from an interview with the author that I recently read, this decision was largely fortuitous; certainly it was fortunate!  Any story about Nazi Germany can't end well, but by personifying Death, making him (it?) almost compassionate, the deaths become a little less horrific.  A group of Jewish prisoners leaping to their death from a precipice is ghastly - but somehow the idea that Death is there, deliberately catching their souls before they land, makes it more bearable.  Zusak's use of foreshadowing is similarly cunning: by planting clues in section/chapter titles and in Death's off-hand remarks about shocks/horrors to come, the author provides readers a chance to emotionally prepare for them, so that they are (almost) endurable.  I contrast this with works like Schindlers List, which are so unrelentingly horrific that they are almost impossible to read.  In contrast, Zusak has found a way to present horrific events without compelling us to run away from them.<br /><br />Another benefit is that this device allows the author to utilize a narrative voice entirely unbound by preconceived notions.  Because, face it, is there any period of history about which Americans possess more preconceived notions than Nazi Germany?  But by utilizing a narrator whose perspective is entirely bereft of emotion (not to mention cliché), the author allows us to experience even the most familiar elements of his tale - from ideas as innocuous as weather to themes as vast as morality - in ways that fresh, stripped of subliminal baggage, and provocative.<br /><br />Thanks to all of the above, Book Thief accomplishes what few books about Nazi Germany accomplish, spinning a tale that challenges stereotypes; that presents rather than judges; that depicts humiliation without stripping its characters of dignity; and that forces us to abandon our pre-packaged \\"mental newsreels\\" of Nazi Germany in order to replace the images with real faces, real lives, real emotions, real epiphanies, and real understanding.
B0058O84G0|2.0|Unless you are a student of war time politics (WWI) and interested in understanding how the author has woven that in to his imagination,.. avoid this book completely.<br />90% of the book is World War I politics and dynamics dealt in such details, pages and pages of it. The author got so carried away by the subject that the story is very weak, characters are some how force fitted in to the story resulting in an utterly boring reading experience and absolutely no value for money. I am so disappointed with this piece of work that I do not think I will touch another work of Ken in the near future.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Enjoyed the read with the twists and turns. Felt sorry for the husband in the end!He got punished more than he deserved....A sequel perhaps?
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Wow.  I saw Alien when I was a kid, during its original run.  It was the first R rated movie I ever saw.  For me, that was a big deal at the time.  I never forgot the experience.<br /><br />When I watched this transfer of Alien I felt like I was both watching the movie again, and for the first time.  What I mean is, I knew the story, the characters, the scenes, etc. . .but I have never seen nor heard the film like this.  I have been buying a ton of blu-rays and enjoy the medium (and yes, old films, if properly restored, look much better on Blu-ray than upconverted DVD).  I own a variety of old movies on Blu-ray.  This restoration, however, is probably the best I have seen.  All of the restorations in this set are done pretty well, but Alien is just amazing - and it is the oldest of the lot and in my opinion, the best film of this series.  The other films look and sound very good as well, but do not appear to have received quite the same level of lavish restoration.  Even the popular sequel Aliens does not match the remastering of the original.  This set is well worth its cost and believe me, if you like the original Alien, this transfer will blow you away.
B004CFBMRY|4.0|I really enjoyed Born to Run. I found it inspirational to the extent that I have started running again after many, many years of not doing so; and doing so successfully in Vibram KSOs.<br /><br />Through Chris we are introduced to many amazing characters and their interesting and inspiring stories. I've read some of the reviews that say Chris didn't get all his facts right - don't let this put you off.<br /><br />There is a lot of very useful information about life and running which I used as the basis for further reading.

B004LROUW2|3.0|First, let me say that this was my first Murakami novel. A number of people have said that 1Q84 is not the right book to start with, if you want to get into this author, and perhaps I should have listened. Murakami has a distinct style. His greatest strength perhaps is his ability to create a mood that is just a bit off, so that the entire time you're reading this book you feel the world is not quite right--almost a Kafkaesque kind of feeling.<br /><br />His characters are fascinating, quirky but distant. I'm tempted to say they are flat, but on closer inspection, they're complex with pained backstories, their distance more the result of alienation than weak writing. The two protagonists, Tengo and Aomame fit this description. They wander through their early adulthood with a sense of isolation bordering on despair, both independently clinging to one shining moment in their childhood when they touched each other. But in a world of alienation, they are unable to meet. So they enter an alternate reality, a world slightly off, where Japanese police carry guns and two moons rise in the night sky, at least for some people. Murakami has accomplished what all great writers do, pulling me into his world and connecting me to strong characters.<br /><br />So why three stars. This author knows how to write a plot. In places the story races along, making the reader turn pages and want to know more. But he seems to feel no obligation to be consistent or finish what he starts. Sure, Tengo and Aomame do finally get together (not a spoiler--that should be obvious to any reader from the start). But he introduces major new characters after several hundred pages (The investigator, Ushikawa, appears late and dominates a portion of the last third of the book, a point-of-view character, needed to further the plot, but overdeveloped). I believe Murakami's greatest sin is to introduce us to his most intriguing character, the little girl Fuka-Eri and then drop her like a hot potato. Fuka-Eri is author of the mysterious story Air Chrysalis, fugitive from the mysterious Sakigake cult and conduit to the Little People, all major plot elements that keep you reading for hundreds of pages. And then suddenly--never mind. She was part of the alternate world and just goes away.<br /><br />Over nine hundred pages is a lot of book to create a mood and place intriguing characters in a strange alternate world. The book is well written and fast paced for most of the story. But this author deemed it unnecessary to tie major plot elements together at the end, leaving me feeling cheated.is author of the mysterious story Air Chrysalis, fugitive from the mysterious Sakigake cult and conduit to the Little People, all major plot elements that keep you reading for hundreds of pages.

B007AB7OKG|5.0|Another great season.  Characters are fully developed and their interaction is mature and tightly crafted.  A must have.  If you waited or are new to the show it's a great bargain to buy the whole season as a package.  We're hooked in my house and buy each episode as they come out and watch reruns whenever we want.  Love it.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|the game is very good. Just needs to offer a little help when you are  stuck, I do like the game a lot.

B00933U1EU|5.0|Finally, a show involving the fight against terrorism that allows the audience to use the grey matter between our ears.  Not some mindless macho BS like 24.  The acting of the three lead characters is outstanding.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I enjoyed the books, but somehow the movie didn't cut it for me. Maybe it's that it is such a gruesome story that anything that lightens and brightens it seems unrealistic. The movie just had a little bit of wizard of Oz to it.
B008N1LL42|4.0|Okay, to start with I expected absolutely nothing from this movie. I bought it with the full and absolute expectation that I would get nothing out of it but a waste of two hours. What a shocker. It was funny, entertaining, enjoyable, well done and over all not bad. This movie will never win an award or critical acclaim, but that makes it all the better IMHO.
B00933JL0A|3.0|What the android OS needs is a selection of strategy games that aren't either Tower Defense or Time Management.  Townsman creeps toward time management, but stops short before it becomes a \\"sign in for three minutes every day, just to click on my buildings\\" experience.  It would be better if it were turn based, and if it had a clear way of organizing the sorts of data it expects you to process (such as product production, supply demand, et cetera).  It's the best strategy game on Android right now, but that isn't really saying much.

B0069JBKHI|1.0|This is by far the worst monitor to spend so much money on. It never connects and whatever they advertise on their website is total nonsense. The worst of all is their customer service. If something ever goes wrong only god can help you.<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
B007V9YF5E|2.0|This movie was one I had looked forward to for quite a while and now I can't remember why. Without giving anything away, let's say it jumps around a lot, there is very little rhyme and reason as to why things are happening and the cast seems to have less a clue about what was going on than I did. Poor editting, mediocre cinema, poor writing, bad plot, horrible dialog. It's all there. It's just a sad movie and yet I might suggest you watch it . . . so I don't have to suffer alone.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Very disappointing.  Way too much dialogue and not enough action.  Most of the action is at the end of the story.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is one of the most.... Scratch that this is the best superhero film I've seen to date insofar as its ability to get the characters so well interwoven, so many different super dominant personalities, and yet its perfect as one superhero film that isn't even overly long. By the time you get the REAL action so much action has already occurred you think the movies already over but just at that point it pick right back up and BLOWS YOU AWAY. The Hulk is s show stealer he just makes this movie that would have been awesome into what I see as the best superhero film up to this date. (that is action oriented I personally find V for vendetta to be a superior movie. Although; just because it was penned by a superhero author and published by DC doesn't make V a super hero he's just a super-Idealist)<br /><br />Summary: Rent/buy/kill/steal/suck D for money whatever WATCH THIS MOVIE!!

B000LTAY1U|5.0|This is the most quality and value thing for the money in my life. Don't to be fooled by the price.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Nicely constructed, well written thriller. I liked it a lot and recommend it. That said, when it was all over, I wanted there to have been some possibility of escape so that it felt redemptive in some way.
B005HE5J7I|3.0|The intrigue and corruption of politics dates back to the ice man age as reflected in this novel.It is however too verbose and detailed for my taste.I would have enjoyed this novel more if it had centered more on the characters then on the historical and descriptive passages.<br />I found I was struggling to try to finish it rather than anxious to.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|This movie held me at the TV through out the entire movie...Would and have told everyone I see that they have to watch this movie.....
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|I regretfully fell prey to this aweful display of acting and overall storytelling. To be fair, Charlese Theron and Mr. Helmsworth were at their usual best, but were still not enough to make up for Kristen Stewart's usual depressing, monotone, unconvincing, amateur, pissy spoiled teen performance. I hate it when movies don't live up to the expectations set by the trailer.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child, in his most recent offering, sticks to the formula that has made him one of the top suspense writers today.  Jack Reacher displays all the characteristics we have come to love, as he works to solve a possible kidnapping, or was it a murder? Is the CIA party to deeds or just bumbling along?  And what's with the FBI? Why are they after Jack. Enjoyable escape as you read through the pages while Jack takes care of the bad guys in his gritty way. And yes, there is a new woman in his life, he meets along the way on his way to Susan, the Commanding Officer of 110th MP in Virginia, a carry over from the \\"61 Hours\\" and \\"Worth Dying for\\" books.  If you know Jack, you will love the book.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|I actually knew right away I was going to like this short record upon first listen. I was drawn in by the thick Sabbathy sound. Now that I have listened a few more times I am loving it. Sludgy, heavy, and really good writing.<br /><br />I can't stop listening and that doesn't happen to me that often these days.<br /><br />This album really does kick.<br /><br />And to think, we have 3 more EP's on the way.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|NOT AT ALL UP TO THE AUTHOR'S USUAL WORK.  THE IST 60% OF THE BOOK IS JUST FILLING IN THE PAGES WITH USLESS VERBAGE.  THE LAST 40% HAD SOME MERIT BUT BY THEN,I WAS JUST TRYING TO FINISH THE BOOK AND DISCARD IT.  VERY DISAPPOINTING
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I.think this app is pre cool Like it tells u when u Are charging(sorry I'm high right now) but it tells u ur battery healtth and stuff
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good book. Story took a couple of different turns...had me playing detective throughout.  Makes you not want to put it down!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I was a little disappointed with the second part of the trilogy.  The first book was a real page turner, the second seemed to drag a bit.  I can't put my finger on exactly what the problem was, but the characters didn't seem nearly as compelling as in book one.
B009471JQE|5.0|Just an amazing album.  Best one in many years.  Takes them back to their blues roots. Worth the wait.  Job well done boys.
B0012PDVUS|5.0|Blade Runner set a standard for Sci-Fi Noir that has yet to be met. It is a movie that holds up wonderfully over the years and will remain a \\"game changer\\" for the industry. Simply unparalleled in my lifetime.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Page turner!  Well written and spot on with details.  Highly recommended.  Filled with details but not classified items.  Unlike the White House which leaked classified information while spiking the football.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I loved the movie in theatres and was excited to see that Amazon had it on sale for $10! This is definitely the best Mission Impossible movie that has come out. I can't wait for the next one.
B002VZC9CY|5.0|This CD is absolutely beautiful, it's takes you away from everyday life. Natalie is at her best ( and nobody comes close to her ) creating music you can listen to over and over and never tire of.<br />.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I personally have not read \\"Life of Pi.\\" I purchased it for my duaghter when she was required to read it for school and a copy was not provided. She says that the book is better then 5 stars it should be 10! Her review may get me to read it for myself.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book definitely lived up to the hype. I hope that the author comes out with a book from Christian's perspective.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This plot keeps you guessing - and most times you have to rethink how you thought the book would end.  Lots of twists and turns to keep you reading.  Many references to the way the mainstream news reports and how that skews the public's view of who is guilty before the events even play out. Would definitely read a sequel to this one.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|I think back to when I took my youngest son to see Independence Day. After it was over, I realized how dumb it was and I really felt guilty over how much I enjoyed it. Oh, and my son loved it too.<br /><br />Well Battleship is in that same category. I must say it takes about 30 minutes for the action to start but when it does ,there's no let up. It's just a rockem sockem good time .Expect some great CGI. So, Sit back ,grab some pop corn,and let the movie take over.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It is a good, basic calculator. The buttons are big and easy to use. My son uses his Kindle Fire for homework and it is helpful to have a calculator handy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What else can I say that others have not said? All these 5-star ratings are real. Intrigued by the overwhelming positive reviews given on this book, I joined the bandwagon and experienced for myself the thrill of learning how it is to live in a Silo. I was a little unconvinced during the first 2 chapters as the author disappointingly killed one main character to another- the sheriff, the mayor, the deputy sheriff- and left me wondering what's on the author's mind. When another character, Juliette, was sent to cleaning, I thought the story will evolve with another one- Lukas, maybe - but much to my surprise, it did not end the way I thought it would be. The author even managed to introduce new characters by the end of the book, giving more meaning and justice to the plot.  Hence, the book deserves no less than five (5) stars for unpredictability.<br /><br />The setting of the story was also a fresh idea. The author effectively created a different kind of world with its own law and culture. I liked how the structure of the Silo defined the people's way of life and affected its political system, peace and order, economic distribution, and modes of communication. The characters are, unquestionably, humans as demonstrated by very familiar emotions, such as physical strain, kinship, love, and desire for power. But how these people lived and survived a constrained place, such as the Silo, is something to look forward to. The author built a place where I simply do not see myself living in. In this case, the book deserves another five (5) stars for uniqueness and creativity.<br /><br />And while the characters were as enthralling as the Silo(s), the book will definitely knock you off your feet and leave you wanting for more. In passing, this book reminds me of another book I recently read entitled, The Lodestone Trilogy ([[ASIN:B006OOC5MC The Lodestone Trilogy (Limited Edition) (The Lodestone Series)]]). I was never a fan of sci-fi or epic novels, but these are books I highly recommend to readers like me.  Although the finale was fantastic as it is, I still hope that the author will publish a sequel to the book relaying how Mayor Juliette will run Silo 18, how Solo and the kids will start a new life in Silo 17 (and how Juliette will contribute in rebuilding it), and to completely describe what is going on in Silo 20!  With the discovery of heat tapes, I can also imagine how people can start traveling from one Silo to another. Two thumbs up for a great story, and another five (5) stars to the author for his impressive flair in writing.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The form provides constant surprises that are, at the same time, basic truths.  Stunningly beautiful.  So glad so many young people are reading this book.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|This book was so good, patti smith is at her most poetic writing about her love and life with Robert maplethorpe. In this book, smith takes the reader with her through Brooklyn and New York of the 60s and 70s, detailing encounters with now famous people at the Chelsea hotel. A great read, I could not put it down!
B0083DJUMA|5.0|I feel that many reviewers will \\"review\\" the technologies referenced in this book, rather than the book itself. So I would like to first make a comment on the technology, then I will speak about the book.<br /><br />I am constantly less than satisfied with products that I buy because of poor build quality, unnecessary complexity, lacking functionality, or inability to personalize features; one simple example, for instance, might be TV remote controls - the battery cover gets lost, the buttons are hard to find in the dark and half the controller includes DVD functionality (Pause, Fast Forward, etc.) when all I am typically trying to do is turn on the TV and PS3 for some Netflix. I digress, but you can tell, this is a peeve of mine. When I read this book, it gives me hope that I might be able to deal with such common frustrations. The naysayers will trivialize these tools, lamenting that they fall short of nanotechnological matter compilers, but then, well, they are missing the point. No tool is best for all situations, but new tools should always be welcome.<br /><br />Before you let my above comment make you believe that I am just a materialistic American who expects New Things to solve my problems (I am, but I do it with self-awareness) I would also like to say that I also believe that these technologies will have a much more profound impact on developing nations and cultures. Designing ultra-low-cost products not just for but with and alongside the ultra-poor (<$1/day) will become more and more possible with these types of manufacturing technologies. I fully expect to see CAD (Cardboard Aided Design) and Maker Labs in use in Africa in the near future. Local design solutions and local manufacturing - a formative duo.<br /><br />On the book itself I appreciate that it is rather reasonably sized and not so full of repetitive content that I started skimming to get to the point; I finished the book in just a few days, and it was jam packed with information. His book isfirst and foremost a book about people and secondly about the technology. If you are interested in 3D Printing (the poster child of this movement), CNC robotics (Computer Numerical Control), 3D scanners, crowdsourcing, Arduino microcontrollers, and the culture of tinkering, this book will offer a clear and concise vision of that future. If you are already fully informed about all these technologies, this book will offer case studies in those who have already started to see success in this area, and some of the methods on how they did it.<br /><br />For all those out there who are struggling in our fledgeling economy, working dead-end jobs without even a cost of living raise, perhaps this book will incite you to take the situation into your own hands. Certainly there is opportunity here, and this book can help point you in many promising directions. Highly recommended.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Wanted to know what happened in a bad way and was pleased with the ending. However, the journey was just ok and had a couple of bland chapters.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|TPG have a unique sound, hard to come by these days. Oddly enough, they do it with an eclectic mix of classical and music from just about every other genre, except maybe country?  I got hooked watching \\"What makes you beautiful\\" on you tube, then found that the visuals on the videos (filmed in Utah)  are just as fantastic.  This is a must buy!
1612680011|5.0|This is a very amazing book, I think it should be on everyone's to-do list.  Very good reading and I would challenge anyone to read it and not agree with what is said.
B003SI05PG|5.0|We love it. Always have, always will. Thanks Tim and crew.<br />Jack Jack we love you Jack take care of Sally or they'll throw you in a sack. That's my twenty words and I don't want them back.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Like all the other Rick Riordan Greek books. It keeps you wanting to know more and what's gonna happen when you turn the page.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher is always an interesting character, good read I am a big fan and<br />already waiting for his next adventure.
B00932ANQM|5.0|Zach Efron has made a successful transition from teen heartthrob to complex adult in this new romance comedy. Check this one out. It's a winner.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This is a 500 plus page novel which I read on my kindle. It took me 77% in to enjoy the book. The last 23% was great. But the average person isn't going to hold on so long for a story to grab them. It does get great at the end. And there are several brillant moments in this book. If you are looking for a Harry Potter keep looking!!!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|If a star is nuts enough to do crazy stunts. I could never be paid enough to do that. The movie is action from moment one. Never stops and let you rest.  The plot has many twists and turns that are good enough to keep you watching.  I am sure there will be another one in a year or two. Everyone involved did a great job.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I thought this sounded like a great app to have so I downloaded it. I have had nothing but problems. I am trying to pick my pictures at the very beginning of the sign up process but it keeps crashing on me. I cant get any further in the process.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Good but not to to Mr. Child's standards for jack reacher.  Plot lacked the usual exciting twists & turns & deemed rather predictable and really rather boring at times. Poor chacter developement not to to Child's standards.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Was good to view prior to seeing the play on Broadway.  It was a little different than the broadway play.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|i found this book hard to put down. The incite and emotion into the life of the SEALS before and after the mission made this a  very enjoyable read.
B007UXTG8M|4.0|If you're a Michael Fassbender fan, this is a great movie to see his skills in.  It's a sad story, but he really plays all the intricacies of if sooo well.  It's got a good supporting cast, but I could not stop thinking about what a job Fassbender did with this material!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|An excellent, original and honest view of a much written about period of history. Once again Follett writes from a variety of perspectives, makes his characters relevant to his readers and leaves us hungry for the next book of the series. I will re-read this book more than once!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a very good book where one of our nations heroes shares with us a brief picture into a portion of his life. We owe these men our respect and gratitude.  Not a fabricated story to appease politicians.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a great book, but I didn't like the ending.  I was like \\"that's it?\\"  Just seemed to go a strange direction in the end.
B0054JELS4|3.0|Was happy with the product at 1st glance.  One Episode of Season 1 was missing.  Wasn't too concerned.  However, 1st disc of Season 4 was unplayable, skipping, audio missing, incomplete episodes that stopped in the middle.  The next disc was fine, but I'm beginning to wonder what lies ahead on the others.  I'm sorry I didn't buy this from a store so that I could easily return unplayable/missing discs.
0316228532|5.0|I loved this book. It was one of those far-reaching novels covering so many characters in the small town of Pagford. Rowling slowly builds up this house of cards, this Jenga tower, intertwining all the characters (the cards or the blocks, whichever metaphor you prefer) into everyday life. Then, she starts pulling a card here, a Jenga block there, until Pagford's pretty facade is completely destroyed.<br /><br />It's a slower read but these types of books have way more emotional and intellectual payoff at the end. It's worth every word.
B00633W614|5.0|As usual Archer is a great story teller.  Easy to read and a great page flipper.  Also has unexpected twists.  All of his books follow the same pattern which detracts some but not much. J. Garland
B009AJD5E0|4.0|Not exactly what I expected, Some drag, but thats typical for the director.  good movie would reccomend to friends or family
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|of all of the names of tribes, players, towns, cities, mages, wizards, gods, demons. Whew! Definitely worth the struggle though.  I really enjoyed this first of 10 books in this series.  I really am glad I came upon these after the series is complete because now I can work my way through them and not have to wait for the next chapter to unfold.  Engaging story makes it hard to figure out just who the good guys are (if there are any). Give this series a try.  If you can get past the first 100 or so pages you will be ok.  Just print a copy of the players and keep it handy.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|so glad I found this app.  so easy to read the blog posts.  I think it is great I can mark the ones I want to go back to.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Does anyone know what the two extra disks will be, and if they are exclusive to this trilogy set? I am really excited, and can't wait for December 4.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Typical well-written Reacher fare, but this novel is more talky than most. It's an interesting plot, but the action seemed to move slower than most.
B0091THRCU|1.0|I ordered a Suede Tan Snugg for my iPhone 5 on Sept. 28th.  On Oct. 6th, some 8 days later, I received, to my disappointment, a Black Snugg instead.  The first thing I noticed was the petroleum like smell; something you would notice when buying a cheap bicycle tire from Walmart.  For this reason, that is why I decided to order the suede tan.  In addition, this item was not Prime eligible, so I was at the mercy of the oh so dependable USPS.  The package was ordered on Sept. 28th and postmarked on Oct. 3rd.  5 Days to process??  3 days to deliver from 2 states away, which isn't all that bad for the USPS.  Recommendation: 1) Send what customers actually order, 2) Make Prime eligible, 3) Use better quality material for the black case so it doesn't seem like a cheap counterfeit.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Awesome book... Even better trilogy!!! I am on book three and can't wait to see what happens to these kids.  Highly recommend!!!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a must-read for anyone living in the 21st century.  Walter Isaacson does a wonderful job of synthesizing the many ingredients in the complex life of Steve Jobs, an emotional and insecure individual who changed our lives forever.
1582701709|5.0|I give this book to many people.  It is a valuable gift because it helps people to think positively about life and its possibilities.

B0098VXE50|4.0|I enjoyed watching the extended version of Snow White & The Huntsman. I loved the special effects and would watch the movie again just for that.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have read all the Reacher Novels and this one ranks with the best.  Reacher continues to amaze by the trouble he finds himself in and how he finishes off the bad guys.  Highly recomment.
0811879542|5.0|We were setting up the book fair and I grabbed this book. Not realizing the fun the would ensue. I read it with a group of 6th graders and they were fighting over who would shake the book. While I would not buy this book for this age group. I can imagine how fun it would be with the younger crowd. A great imaginative book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's really good.  Works like it should. Recommended for basic math; it's a nice app for those who need a quick calculator.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Best book in the series so far.  Love the \\"character Format Chapters\\".  I just bought Season 1 HBO disc. Now my husband can enjoy The Game of Thrones. Where is book 6?????
161382212X|5.0|This is one of the most important books ever written.  It should be mandatory reading for all human beings.  The wisdom imparted in Meditations will help one discover not only how to live a better life, but also what is truly important in life.  An absolute must for everyone, especially those with a predilection for philosophy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is fun with options of creative mode \\"just build and play \\" or regular which you have challenges.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Good plot, muct read for all Lee Child/Jack Reacher fans.<br />Reinforces that Tom Cruise is the wrong actor to play Reacher.
B0027MJU00|4.0|The story told by Libby Day is haunting and a little bit odd. I felt I  had to read Jillian Flynn's other works after reading Gone Girl and boy was I right!<br />While the plot is a bit slow in spots the story kept me engaged and I really wanted to know what would happen to Libby and the odd cast of characters she attracks.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I watch movies to be entertained. This movie did that. It was well acted by all. The story was quite different than what I expected out of Snow White, but I still enjoyed it.
B00005J79J|5.0|Over the past year I probably purchased 10 of Sarah's albums... 7 out of 10 were beautiful... BUT THIS CD and her 2-disc DVD/CD Live in Vienna concert (in Saint Stephan's Cathedral) are SIMPLY PERFECT... Thanks Sarah...
B001GMQALY|4.0|The plot is about a woman seduced by a guy who does not have her interest at heart. Warning: some nudity and lots of sexual stuff. It was well played and kept your interest.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|P!nk's best album to date!  Great beats, great lyrics, and even great duets.  P!nk continues to grow as an artist and songwriter, making this her best album yet!
B009CPRYG2|5.0|Batman the dark night returns met all my expectations. These days seem to be for the come back of old stars. I mean if JR Ewing can make a strong come back, why not Bruce Wayne. Good for the old guards, old but not dead. The movie lives up to the legend, with new villains, and old ones waiting. Be ready for a thrill ride.
B009CPES4I|4.0|I wasn't sure by the title what this was going to be but it was a tender story of aging adults finding a home in India. The best part were the veteran british actors in this film! I would watch it again.
0374214913|5.0|This book was a delight!  So many interesting ideas packed easily into a light and fun read.  I loved the whole thread about dimensions running through the book.  (***spoiler alert***).  It made me wonder at the end what a book would be in 3-D (not counting pop-up books, which I'll get to later).  Would you have to experience the text bodily?  I guess the way in which the Gerristzoon code had to be broken was an example of having to \\"literally\\" touch the text in order to understand the message.  Or would a book be made 3-D by being sent through space and time to multiple readers via Hadoop?  Or is the 3rd dimension simply meaning/interpretation?<br /><br />The author seems quite intrigued by 3-D.  He has the store clerk render the bookshop in 3-D (which is 3-D made into 2-D), Matropolis is a three dimensional model, the Founder's Code is a three dimensional construct rather than a textual one, Clay is frightened in the warehouse by a 2 dimensional painting he mistakes for a 3 dimensional person, the Grumble scanner goes from flat cardboard to a 3 dimensional scanner.  Have fun finding more examples!<br /><br />I thought it would be lovely to have a Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore pop-up book come out for the holidays!  You could have a pop-up of the bookstore (complete with glow-in-the-dark books), one of Matropolis, a pop-up Grumble scanner, a pop-up warehouse with moving shelves, and at the end, a pop-up holiday message encoded in 3-D Gerristzoon type punches.<br /><br />I haven't enjoyed a book so much in a long while.  Highly recommend!
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|This turned out to be a much better compilation than some of his later ones. Good album and songs make you think.

B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever please come with an update needs bigger world and at least an enchanting table this game is so awsome
B008Y1RTUG|2.0|Mirror...Mirror starring Julia Roberts was a much better movie.  Neither the Huntsman nor Snow were fully developed characters and didn't deserve their status on the marquee.  An imprisoned Snow White doesn't emerge as a warrior heroine but as a girl lost to her circumstances.  And who is the huntsman...an actor stuffed in a role for his looks because he cannot be the love interest of Snow White? This movie suffered from a case of reaching for too much while giving too little.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I've read all of them and it's not my favorite...too many holes but I don't read these for the pin point plotting.  I know the formula and I read for the formula.  I want read Reacher doing what Reacher does best.  Observe, note, plan, figure out and kick butt.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read.  It was entertaining and informative. It takes you into several lives of ultrmarathon athletes. I would recommend to all runners and non runners.
B004NELBPC|5.0|This is a great app with lots of information. All articles are grouped into different categories based on subject, so you don't have to waste your time scrolling through topics you're not interested in. I actually prefer the Huffington Post app over the website version.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|This is a great movie, great story along with acting. Highly recommend this to ppl With a scifi thriller taste.
1611761565|1.0|I smell propaganda.  We dropped bombs all over Afghanistan supposedly trying to get UBL, shot missiles, etc.  Should I now believe that as soon as we really knew exactly where the feeble man was, we risked the lives of a \\"hand-picked\\" team of elite soldiers to confront him personally?  It doesn't add up for me.<br /><br />While this doesn't make me an expert, I will say that I was an Arabic linguist in the USAF up until '04 and I watched and participated in the search for UBL.  My un-professional opinion is that UBL was a manufactured enemy.  A real person, for sure, but it's easy to imagine him as a CIA asset, perhaps even an unwitting one, as the FBI does with people in the States.<br /><br />Looking for a motive, Marine Major General Smedley Butler and countless others have testified to the racket called war and this one was no different.  To sum up the last 10 years, UBL purpotedly attacked in '01 (again), so we somehow went to war against Iraq, just as PNAC had been trying to do since the 90s.  It doesn't add up, except in dollars and power.<br /><br />The government pretending to complain about the book being published I believe was effective advertising for propaganda.  \\"But it reveals sensitive secrets!\\" is tasty bait.
0525953728|5.0|This book, \\"No Easy Day\\" is a well written informative book that is surprisingly a compilation of life of a young man realizing his dreams of being a Seal, some life lessons and what it's like before and during \\"DEVGRU\\". Without giving sensitive information you still feel very much in the middle of the action and I had a hard time putting it down. I expected the book to be mainly comprised of the day of the raid and the death of a coward and found it to be so much more. I'm glad to hear a first hand account of that night's happening's \\"most\\" want to see the pictures. I was forced to watch my countrymen leap to they're deaths,hear the 911 call's from the planes and from inside the buildings only to see this for a month straight, but I can't see the death pictures of the coward responsible? Beaureacratic bullshit in my opinion. \\"Mr. Owens\\" has done a fantastic job with this book and I would recommend it to anyone looking for some sort of closure to 9/11. I can undertand that those few \\"quiet professionals\\" who totally disagree with the printing of this book and why they feel that way, I haven't crawled an inch in your boot's much less walked a mile in your shoes so who am I to say. I as a red blooded American who appreciates my freedom and understands it's cost thank you all including \\"Mr. Owens\\" for the mission, dedication, sacrifice's and finally, to hear how this turd floated to the bottom of the sea.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|Ken Follet has been my favorite writer since many years ago when I read Eye of the Needle, and every book after that was so good.  Always had to stay up til 2-3 in the morning to finish and find out what happens.  This is the first and only time I have been disapointed in one of his books.  Took more than a week to get through it, does not pull you into the story.  I am worried for my future reading pleasure.  Wonder if he switched editors, because somebody should have been brutally honest with him: This is not his best effort.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Thought this was the best book written from this author. Would recommend all of the books this author has written and highly recommend reading this book.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|Let it Be is one of the best Beatle albums! And the remastering of the album makes it even better! For those who are skeptical about spending the money to update their album, I say, \\"You won't be sorry!\\"
0525953728|5.0|I have to admit that I was one of those people that bought the book for the supposed hype and to see what made it so controversial, but after I started reading it I was hooked. It usually takes me weeks to knock out a book, but this one was done in three days. I would consider this a must read! Also, don't tell anyone you have it! The number of people at my work that want to read it after the person I lent it to gets done has surpassed ten!
B004O3YGMC|3.0|This is a good app and it does what they said it would do, but I bought it for my art and I find it extreamly hard to use with paint or paint tool sai. I honestly don't know what I would use this app for. I would like my money back.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Very entertaining and outlandish. The book was jam packed full of twists and unexpected turns. Would highly recommend this book to read.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Even though this movie is about  people in the late autumn of their lives it was very! funny and dealt with grown-up issues in a mature and insightful way. Nothing blew up and there was no screeching tire car chase. Yea!
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|Exciting reading - found it extremely informative and it kept me thinking about what really happens in Iran.  Did not know just how much Ross Perot was involved.
1423140605|5.0|Rick Riordan is an exceptional author and has written another amazing book with surprising twists.  This book is a great purchase, but just make sure you've read his previous books to get the full thrill.
B0098VXCR0|5.0|The movie appeared to be well made, lots of energy, some sexy, lots of violence, good rated R movie. No really bad stuff, I let my 11 y/o daughter watch and everything was okay.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app is really awesome and has downloaded whatever I wanted for a long time but all of a sudden its acting stupid
0525953728|5.0|This book was unreal once you start reading it you can't put it down. Hats off to all the seals
B009327P8G|5.0|This was the premier for the series and sets it up nicely. It's a very good series as the recent multiple Emmys might attest. We all came to love Damien in \\"Band of Brothers\\" and subsequent TV appearances and his portrayal in \\"Homeland\\" is a complex bit of business, intentionally leaving the viewer with the \\"Is he or isn't he?\\" questions. And the fact that Claire's character isn't exactly the shining beacon of justice we might expect. Good casting all around, with Mandy heading a nice group of performers.<br />MB
B008M34INW|5.0|Was a decent story line and comical at times. good action. Was worth watching. Wife would not have liked it, was more a action packed, drink a beer and watch as a guy movie.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Just a regular movie, the tipical rebel boy who turns in hero to save the planet. The aliens suposed to be more advance but with oldest ship the Earth wins the battle, OMG!!  I you expect some kind of reference with the boardgame Battleship, just a few seconds.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This product shipped very quickly and it was exactly what I was looking for.  It was great to get such a good deal on this, it was way cheaper than the retail price.
B009G8GRX6|1.0|No energy no nothing :( I love muse but for some reason there is no message in this album and most of all no energy. i just dont think they could top the Resistance.
B000IVW25M|5.0|The classic Snow White story still lives to be an all-time favorite for children young and old.  This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter.  This story is told through classic characters.  For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters.  Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman.<br /><br />Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people:  Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse).<br /><br />Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well.  Famous songs from this movie are \\"I'm Wishing,\\" \\"Whistle While You Work,\\" \\"Hi Ho,\\" and \\"Someday My Prince Will Come.\\"<br /><br />A couple negatives in this movie:  I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince.  Snow White's voice was a bit annoying.<br /><br />Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene.  She mixes a potion and casts a spell.  There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.<br /><br />This particular disk gives lots of special features.  Audio commentary and a game; but my favorite was \\"The Making of Snow White.\\"  You will get a lot of background information on the beginning of Walt Disney!  They also show you some scenes that didn't make the cut into the movie.
B009329Y30|5.0|I read the book and looked forward to seeing the movie. It was very well done with good acting and quality production. This is a compelling movie, suitable for most ages except small children. This is the type of movie Hollywood should make more often.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Delivered fast. Brand new item and was pleased the Dylans' vocals no longer sound as if he has a mouthful of marbles.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|The only problem i had was that it was a little slow and hard to understand. it was fun to be able to write my notes. i love that you can write and insert pics. such a great way to journal!
B0094ZJK4O|5.0|Richie did not disappoint with his new cd. If you like his solo music you will generally like this new album. It is a little different than some of his earlier works but there is such a range in this cd of his own unique styles that it is hard for anyone not to love it. Alternatively, you can get a free single from his website as a preview of what his music is like on the album. That is what I did before purchasing. I love it and i'm glad I purchased his music.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awsome i highly recommend this game I love to play this when i have nothing to do if you never played temple run you should try it.
B000V4NX04|4.0|An searing depiction of what life was like for anyone daring to think differntly under the East German Communist dictatorship, and a classic example of why that regime, of all the Soviet Union's Eastern European satellites was the most hated.
B00933JL0A|5.0|I played he first townsmen and it was pretty awesome, althought it got boring pretty quickly.  The new townsmen took the old one to the next level.  there are so many new things to do, more buildings to build, more quests, more everything.  Although it does have a second currency called &quot;prestige&quot; that you buy with real money, it is really easy to acquire it in game. PLUS its free, so why not give it a try?
B007N31YH0|2.0|I had seen this many years ago and truly had forgotten how not entertaining it was.  I did not like the film and neither did my husband.  It was not clear what was happening in the film.  Wish I could give more stars, but I can not.
1439193630|5.0|Fantastic mini biography, common sense suggestions and advice.  I wasn't sure what to expect from this book.  You read so many \\"How To\\" books - it isn't long before they all sound alike.  The book was more of a conversation with the reader, and really helped me push forward on my own writing.
B0086700CM|5.0|My son, daughter, Neice and myself. All are addicted to temple run. I have to play temple fun every chance I get. Which is every day, I'm so addicted to this game. If you try this game out one time you will be hooked.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great app. Reminds me of days spent dropping coins in one of these. A great time killer without the need for real coins. .
B0019T9FL6|4.0|Jennifer Kate Hudson astounded the world with her outstanding performance alongside the likes of Beyonce' and Eddie Murphy in the movie adaption of the Broadway classic [[ASIN:B000O1799U Dreamgirls]]. This was a demanding role,especially from a relative newcomer. And Hudson not only made an enormous impression vocally in the film,but pulled off her role from an acting perspective so convincingly that she is one of the few personalities of that era who almost upstaged Beyonce',even though it was by no means intentional. It was clear that Hudson was going to have a major impact as a recording artist. The soul/R&B world she was entering into was filled with negligible vocal talents backed up by fair to middling music,to be kind. Especially when it came to female performers. They often were more in the position of being recording super models,more concerned with fashion and makeup than musical talent. So hooking up with Clive Davis at Arista,Hudson basically came at the music world from the opposite end of the spectrum.<br /><br />  \\"Spotlight\\" begins the album with one of it's very best numbers,a vibrant late 70's/early 80's post disco dance/funk number that introduces Hudson's booming soul belt of a voice with a melodically strong number very much worthy of the vocalists abilities. The slower material such as \\"If This Isn't Love\\",\\"Giving Myself\\",\\"You Pulled Me Through\\",\\"Invisible\\" and the dynamic \\"Can't Stop The Rain\\" get the full on Aretha treatment where her vocal relationship with the music and melody is so close knit it seems a sure fire chance she wrote the songs herself. For a track featuring a cliched guest rapper the beat boxing and harmonically rich \\"Pocketbook\\",with Ludacris not only has a spicy sense of humor about it but is extremely funky musically and his rap goes well with the song. Cannot say the same for \\"What's Wrong (Go Away) with T-Pain,which is too defined by it's cliches of autotune and too much attention focused on the guest where..well one might feel they want to take the song title literally.<br /><br />  Hudson brings out the heavy southern soul flavor on both \\"I'm His Only Woman\\",a sassy two timer anthem with her and Fantasia as \\"the two lovers\\" and \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\". Musically and vocally,this challenging gospel style soul number is the highlight of the entire album with Hudson and the band bursting out of the music with so much emotional expression that Hudson seems like she will hold her final note in the song for an eternity. The closer is the more obvious gospel of \\"Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There\\",done more subtly. In the end,this is not a perfect album. But few of the best debuts are. It often isn't fair to the rest of an artists career if it is. But the majority of the album is extremely strong,and musically varied just to the right point where a vocalist of Hudson's caliber is able to discover what levels of soul and grooves she's best at dealing with. In the end,I'm convinced that with the release of this debut that she made those decisions very quickly and ably.t feel they want to take the song title literally.<br /><br />  Hudson brings out the heavy southern soul flavor on both \\"I'm His Only Woman\\",a sassy two timer anthem with her and Fantasia as \\"the two lovers\\" and \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\".

0345803507|5.0|Hi all,<br /><br />Very recommended book.<br />My wife enjoyed reading it very much.<br />And afterward me too ..<br />The Book if little different from other books that she read lately and written in very pleasant way.
B0026772N8|1.0|I've been wanting to read this for years.  I'm both a MC rider and a \\"child\\" of the 60's and early 70's.  A harder reading bunch of crap I've never seen.  Either write a true MC manual or true \\"this is my philosophy\\" book.
B0089ZEEYG|4.0|My kids love this game. Its very simple. Eat the food. Dont get hit by enemies. My three year old thinks ut so funny when the demon burps r farts. And i think its fun to see him laughing.
B0083Z3O8Y|1.0|I hate it. So boring. I fell asleep at the first page. its great if youre into that old 1800s kind of speech.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Seemed to be more of an autobiography about the author than I expected.  A very delicate subject since there were so many possibilities of compromise regarding security.  Glad I read it, at least from his perspective.
0307272702|5.0|In the couple of years since I've read this book in about 4 days back-to-back, it has completely changed my life.  Now i just eat meats (with fat), eggs, cheese and nuts.  I've lost 30 lbs, got off both my cholesterol and blood pressure medicine and have never felt better, mentally or physically.<br />It was quite amazing to me to learn that all the low-fat diets, exercise, gyms, nutritionist, major companies like w** watchers and J** craig, N** system,  and so-called common knowledge about what is a health diet today is all a pack of lies to further their careers and pocket-books at the expense of making you even fatter and diabetic.<br />Sure you can starve yourself and eat no calories or eat what we've eaten for 2 million years already, that we are uniquely designed to process - meat.<br />Sure I used to be on a low-fat diet for 20 years, but that's just cause I followed the main-stream media and didn't know better, and i was still overweight and felt weak all the time.<br />Sure its hard getting started and staying on a meat-based diet, but once you get past about 6 months you can keep going.  its simple and it works, and there's no limit on how much you can eat.<br />Yeah, this is not a diet-book, but a fact-based science book you can use your own brain and make your own diet plan that works for you.  I don't like people telling me what to eat on certain days or not, and this is not that kind of book.<br />Hands down, I'm 47, and this is the best, most enlightening, life-changing book or piece of information I have ever read.  This serious hit-you-in-face, wake up to reality kind of information.<br />What if everything you've been told about low-fat diet and nutrition is a lie, its a shocker, I've gotta say to put in mildly.  But I'm living proof you can be very healthy on a high-protein diet -- lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, lower triglycerides.  Every time I see my doctor she is amazed.  My diet is even more strict than a diabetic, talk about healthy.  I'm eating 1 lb  hamburgers, 4 eggs for breakfast, bacon, sausages, steaks, and lovin it!  Sorry but fat in your diet is not the same as fat in you, one doesn't just turn into the other.  (Just skip the sugar, beans, starch, rice, bread, etc. )  You think its not healthy -- read up my friend, get some education here in this book, learn the facts.  This will blow your brain, I guarantee it.  It works, its a fact, its healthy.  What else can I say?

The leather is of high quality and all the other features were great they just did a poor job with the stitching.  I am returning it for a refund.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - my first in this series, and am looking forward to the next by Lee Child.<br />The story line was good and written well.  A good plot with variety which held the reader with several twists and unexpected reveals.<br />At times, the main character, Jack Reacher, seems a little too good to be true in his ability to get himself<br />out of situations.  However, that is the way of heroes, isn't it?
B006VREHRS|5.0|Other than a carnivale like federal agent a nice change.  Steve B does a marvelous job as a corrupt city boss.

B002RVCD6O|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  No problems with the disk.  I love the whole Potter series. It's getting a lot darker as we move to the end of the series.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was so disappointed when I finished the last page... I forgot that I was at the end of the book! It takes you back to the beginning like that, and you automatically think you're starting over! I love these books! I will definitely be re-reading this trilogy very soon. They better make movies!!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|THE MOVIE WAS NOT BAD, BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER AND HAD MORE ACTION. THE MAIN ACTRESSES WERE VERY GOOD. MAYBE THEY SHOULD BRING OUT PART 2 WITH MORE MAGIC SPELLS AND MYSTERY.
B008CP93S0|3.0|I only rented it to view it. It was OK, but not quite my type of comedy.  But I must admit I'm more of a drama, adventure, fantasy type of person.
B007HGPBRC|1.0|Might've been worthy as a Kindle Single, but the content, despite the significance of context and this devoted Hitchens reader's sense of loss, was not worth the price.
B0083GCK5G|3.0|While not as good as say Pet Sounds, this new album has flashes of the old Beach Boys and some clear nostalgia  for those remembering back to those days. Worth the price of admission.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|If you like Child's style and you know about his main character, Jack Reacher, then you'll like this book.  Jack is a true nomad who never puts down serious roots and almost never has a 'serious' relationship.  That will probably turn some readers off (especially if you need the gooey romantic interludes).<br /><br />Jack just seems to \\"show up\\" and then get involved in the strangest cases which his sense of honor and right won't let him ignore (former military MP).<br /><br />Furthermore, don't expect a great resolution to the problems. Jack gets stuff done, then he just vanishes--no long good-byes, no real explanations to authority--he just leaves!<br /><br />I don't dislike these endings because it jibes with his rather aloof character, but some readers might not like it if they want everything tied up in a neat little package with a bow on top.<br /><br />Child's writing is also direct and on point, like Jack.  Things happen quickly and decisively (though at times, implausibly!)<br /><br />I still prefer the style of John Sandford and Michael Connelly over EVERYONE else in that genre, but Child is still a fun ride and read.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I rented it but will eventually purchase this video.  I really like the different take on a very popular fairy tale.
B00932HEX2|4.0|This program really held our interest.  The acting was phenomenal! The only thing we didn't like was the graphic sex scenes.  We felt that they were unnecessary and pointless.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This movie was just great.  Fantastic cast and performances.  Great scenes and effects.  Story was good.<br />I rented it, now to buy it.
B009157BWU|5.0|Chimpanzee puts a special narrative to what most of us will never see deep within the jungle.  Amazing how creation finds a way to care of its young and abandoned, even to the point of going against the natural order of the chimpanzee species.  Great movie!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I was using FreeDI app before, but it didn't allow me to download a youtube video as mp3.  I kept getting errors.  So I installed this app, and it worked flawlessly. I also like the fact that it gives me an option to watch or download the youtube video.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the app stopped working for a few days, and kept asking me to install an update that was not available in the kindle store. Only the preview option was working.  The problem cleared after a few days, and the app is now working correctly.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|This book was very useful and I like the fact that some proceeds go to the foundation.  Portions may be slightly daunting for young children unless an adult helps out, but overall the book was very good.
B000YDIA00|4.0|these boots do run large, I usually wear an 8-8.5 and bought an 7.5 but I feel a 7 would have fit better. There is plenty of wiggle room for my toes.

B008ER9QLK|4.0|Say what you want - no one can deny that this production took big chances and did things that have never before been seen on an opera stage. There are many moments that are extraordinary (the Rhinemaidens, the descent into Nibelheim, the opening of Walkure, the forest scenes in Siegfried), and a few that make you want to tear your hair out (gods entering on slides, the muppet dragon in Siegfried). I was at the Met with my son for opening night of Die Walkure and I want to tell you - at the opening of Act I, when the machine transformed itself into a forest and the snow was falling, it was magical. Some of that you can see from the HD broadcasts, but not the full effect. On the other hand we also got to witness Deborah Voigt fall off the set on the first entrance of her life as Brunnhilde. But she and Bryn Terfel are pros - they didn't miss a beat and improvised with what they had.<br /><br />The blu-ray recording is extraordinarily good. The sound is excellent and the visuals exciting. Somehow they managed to eliminate the machine creaking that was a feature of the live performances, although less so in the HD broadcasts. My only (minor) gripe is that while closeups create an experience you will not have in the theater (unless you are paying more for you seat than I am), I would have liked to have seen a little more utilization of a wider perspective.<br /><br />The singing in this production is excellent, as is the orchestral performance (although as others have noted Luisi's conducting of the immolation scene seems emotionally flat). I thought Voigt was very good - she got better as the cycle developed. Eric Owens and Stephanie Blythe are deserving of all the acclaim they received in their roles. Jay Hunter Morris was great as Siegfried and had a great back story. And Hans-Peter Koenig is terrific - singing in all four operas as Fafner/Hunding/Hagen. The rest of the cast is very good - no weak links.<br /><br />This production will be talked about for a long time and will set a new standard for imaginative production. My guess is that some of the more lame-brained moments will be fixed in subsequent performances.<br /><br />The inclusion of Wagner's Dream is a real bonus. A fascinating documentary - my wife even liked it and she hates opera.<br /><br />I'd give this set 4.5 stars - 4 stars for the opera and 5 stars for the documentary.and will set a new standard for imaginative production.

B005LW5J9O|5.0|I read a lot of non-fiction, but more than any recent book, this one had me re-looking at things in a different way. I haven't considered the Middle Ages since high school. With this book, in addition to the descriptions in the book, I was looking things up in Wiki and constantly thinking about it. The way he explains how finding ancient books led to the Rennasaince was also eye opening. Just a terrific and thought provoking book.

Having received the book on Friday I finished it Saturday afernoon! Recommended read for any reader who respects our military and the sacrifices they make.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I was kinda surprised how HEAVY this CD sounds, they sound more like Metallica than the Rush of old. I like Rock and Roll and this album was more like Heavy Metal. I can hear \\"Moving Pictures\\" all day, \\"Red Barchetta\\" is rock and roll! The tempo changes and riffs are all CLASSIC ROCK! This CD though is not a classic rock album and if anyone says it is, doesnt know what they are talking about. It's not a put down, I'm just stating my taste. I do like the last 2 songs on this CD though, they do have the classic rock sound.  The Band is great, as usual, Geddy's vocals were strong, Neil's lyrics were awesome as ever. It's Rush and I'll listen to it and enjoy it, but for me and my personal tastes of Rush, I long for the older albums of ROCK like 2112, Signals, Grace Under Pressure, ect. I just found this CD too fast and too heavy, maybe I'm the one who'd getting too old and I want a more laid back sound, for that reason, I cannot give this a bad rating at all, Rush gets 4 stars !

B007YJS7G4|5.0|George Lucas did an excellent job at bringing World War II history into the 21st century.  There are far too many films today that glorify war.  This is one that reminds us there was a chance, we as Americans may not have known our current way of life if not for the sacrifice of those before us.  This movie portrays the story of African-American fighter squadrons.  This is just one portion of the contributions that Americans of all races and religions made.  American Indians were known as code speakers because they could speak openly in their native language and not give away positions, plans or secrets.  Their language was known to no one else on earth.  Without the pilots from Tuskegee, Alabama flying in Europe the Americans could have lost the war in the air when the first jets in aviation history (ME-262) were introduced by the Luftwaffe.  It was faster than anything in the sky.  They probably had the ability to reach speeds nearing 600 mph. This group of pilots, known as the Red Tails were the ones to figure out how to shoot them down with the much slower North American P-51D which could barely reach 475 mph in a vertical dive, nearly ripping the wings off of it.  The code speakers in the pacific are what saved American troops from being slaughtered on the ground against Japan. Again, without this group there was a good chance that battle would have been lost.  The price Asian-Americans payed simply because Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.  Yet, again another minority group of Americans that formed their own platoons and battalions and fought harder than other troops, to prove they were behind the American flag.  African-American ground troops were sent to Scandinavia because of the extreme cold temperature.  The people of those countries remember that it was those troops that repelled multiple attempts by Hitler to take over that portion of the world.  Not once did Hitler's army have a foot hold there.  The total contribution the people of color gave to this countryhas always managed to be suppressed or only told in bits and pieces.  Without them, this country would have another language and it wouldn't be Spanish.  This movie? Five Stars!
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|After first watching the 2011 \\"Time Machine\\" DVD where I thought Geddy's voice was just Horrible and shot, although the Band was fantastic! So I then decided to give this a watch. Geddy's vocals on this DVD are in perfect form! Now the Atlanta dicc though (disc 3) Geddy's voice is once again SHOT! So I guess with age, he had good night and bad nights. The main DVD's (1&2) is the Holland concert and it is incredible! It is a very long show, broken into 2 DVD's. Much of Snales and Arrows is played, along with great cuts from the past...Subdivisions, Witch Hunt, Limelight, ect. I found the picture quality to be excellent! Great job filming the show, editing wasn't too bad, the 5.1 mix though coulda been better, not much use of the back speakers I noticed, bit not bad over all. This is a MUST OWN DVD for any Rush fan! Geddy's voice as I said was just FLAWLESS and in top form! The Band was great as usual! This DVD is a great document of their 2008 tour and a great testiment that old men can still rock out!

B008XKSW7M|1.0|I expected it to be much funnier. Seems like they tried too hard to be funny.  Too many characters too.
0547569653|5.0|Eat & Run is the autobiography of the greatest ultramarathoner of our time. In 17 years, Scott Jurek ran 100 ultramarathons, an average of one every two months, winning 34 of them, placing second in 16 of those races and setting 12 new course records. But to Scott, running is much more than simply winning and setting records. Running is about reaching toward perfection, about stopping time and about running through and beyond all physical and mental limits. Scott runs to lose himself, to connect with something larger and to experience the beauty and timelessness of the present moment in sharp focus.<br /><br />In this book, Scott brings the reader along with him on 21 of his runs, freely sharing tips on his methods of preparation, clothing, diet, psychological stages, competitive strategy and philosophy of success. The reader will learn how and why he became a complete vegan, his fascinating relationships with motivators, pacers and competitors, and how he used his painful upbringing to become the most successful at his craft. There are also many references to other top running books, his favorite recipes, the sciences of nutrition and fitness and his four step checklist for assessing in-race injuries.<br /><br />My favorite paragraph was Scott listing the five ways of reaching satori, the sudden Zen-like clarity known in English as \\"the zone\\". He says he has experienced the zone not only when past the point of maximum effort, but also through prayer, meditation, on a five mile jog and mindfully chopping a carrot. That's good news for those of us who long for runner's high, but who will never run even one marathon, let alone run for 24 continuous hours.<br /><br />I recommend Eat & Run for serious runners, for less serious joggers and for anyone curious about the physical, psychological and spiritual aspects of eating and, of course, running.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Wonderful book! Very inspiring and thought provoking. Another Mitch Albion classic that will be around for many years to come.
B009AHWLHE|5.0|I liked this movie way better than the first animated resident evil movie, and I really liked the first one!
B007RI56NY|5.0|This album has such great new lyrics and sounds. I was surprised that most of it is about death and dying, but it's uplifting, despite that!<br />Good work on writing and producing these amazing sounds. Congrats on a fantastic album.  Some of the songs are funny and the \\"name dropping\\" is fantastic.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Great script, great casting, easy to follow as we hadn't read the book. Not appropriate for younger eyes due to the violence.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|After decades as a devoted fan of fiction, I can honestly say this is the first time I read a book for the second time immediately after reading it the first time. On the initial reading, while totally absorbing, the tale felt about half based in reality, with several parts of Jun Do Pak's and The Interrogator's experiences simply beyond reason. I had no context within which to understand it, and I found myself confused a bit like my first time through Dostoyevsky. The second time through, given the environment in which they lived, and after reading the author's notes at the end, the story was more plausible -- and chilling, even some of the loudspeaker episodes.  It makes you even more keenly aware of propaganda, especially in the pre-election stuff with which we're incessantly barraged. In short, this is a terrific book that challenged perceptions.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|awesome game. Once you start playing you don't want to stop. If you just want to play a game that doesn't require a lot of think this is the game.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|In this book, Professor Dawkins starts every chapter with a myth, or a couple of myths from various cultures, that exemplify that culture's attempt to explain the natural world, and then follows it up with how things really work from a scientfic viewpoint backed up by evidence.<br /><br />He isn't denigrating anybody's culture, but just showing how people used to think things happened, contrasted with how they actually happen.  This book is written on a simple level, but is suitable for adults who want to more about science, and the nature of reality.<br /><br />Dawkins is a marvelous teacher, and it really shows in this book!
B00881VLCE|5.0|As a lover of jigsaw puzzles, I had my doubts about this, but when my 6yo son recommended it, I downloaded. Now we both love it--it's great for his fine motor skills and a good way to pass time in waiting rooms, etc.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I actually liked book 2 and 3 better than the first book.<br />You just get hooked in reading the series to see what happens.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|keeps me updated on usage.I use my fire daily and this app helps when running low I can charge and keep using for reading Internet and games.thanks
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Well written, fast paced. Intriging.  Very interesting to compare the lives and the characterics of the women of different eras in history and how their individual circumstances and personal growth affect the outcome of the story,
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I will admit that Katniss has just won the Hunger games and has a lot on her mind, but now that they are over, she really should focus on the capitols revenge rather than Peeta and Gale. I liked the book as a whole, and think that anyone twelve and up can read it. there is also a strong message in there that says that no one has the right to own you. this is also a book that you could read again and again. after reading the book, i went to see the movie, and it ... sucked. first of all, the people were way too old (isn't  it supposed to be children fighting to the death?). secondly, they were all healthy looking (isn't  it supposed to be the HUNGER games instead of the near death but still fat games?). lastly, the filming was all messed up (it was all close ups like reeeealy close). Sorry for criticism, but bottom line, don't watch the movie. five stars for the book, but like one for the movie. P.S. they messed up the  district twelve hand signal (instead  of the the three fingers of the left hand in the air, they used the right hand in the movie).
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is a easy time killer application. I will recommend to download this free application. Have fun. collect more and more coins.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the best book out of the three. It has enough action to keep the reader interested throughout. And, though it has a little bit of a cliche happy ending, it fits well with the story line.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|I have always liked listening to Diana Krall but this record is just so boring.  Her choices of songs for her record were probably heartfelt but she simply could not pull it off.  Who would try to sing \\"There Ain't No Sweet Man....\\" after Martha Wainwright took that tune to the moon and back on the \\"PRIVATE ASTRONOMY\\" album  a few years ago.  She owns that song!  The same is true for \\"Prairie Lullaby\\" - a song that has been performed over the years by Geoff Muldaur (most reecently recorded on \\"PASSWORD\\" ) - an absolutely beautiful song that devoid of it's beauty on this record.  It's unfortunate that the cover is screams \\"buy me I'm sexy\\" and the songs are rendered in such a boring way.  Hopefully this is a minor mis-step for a talent such as Ms. Krall.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|The movie was phenomenal. Period. The perfect way to end the trilogy. The movie no doubt was 5 stars. However, for the product review, Warner Brothers needs to get their head out of their asses and get rid of the Ultraviolet or make it compatible with iTunes. Plain and simple. People shouldn't have to make a flixster account to stream movies when they can just transfer it to iTunes like every other studio does with their releases. GET RID OF THE ULTRAVIOLET!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Very handy app. I do wish that the second-level interface had a large start/stop button on each timer or alarm.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This is my least favorite out of the three because it gets more and more far fetched.  It packs too many conflicts in one book.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and now my kids love this movie .. its a classic .. if you've never seen it and you like Disney movies this is a must for watching with your kids
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a cant put down kind of book. From the first chapter the sheer authentic description captivated the emotion of the book. Set the story line for the feeling to come. It was better written than Fifty Shades of Grey. I have now read the second book and wait in anticipation of the third. Kept me wanting more!! Highly recommend!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have to agree with other reviews. Although I am a fan of Lee Child I was disappointed by this book. The same problems already mentioned: no plot, a lot of senseless driving, boring in large parts and no significant action until the very last pages. Coming late to the Reacher novels, I read all the previous ones in just a month and a half. This novel took me three days to read as It did not have the grit or attraction of the others. I hope the next Reacher novel is back up to the Lee Child standard,
B00828JCI8|5.0|I absolutely love \\"The Big Bang Theory\\". It one of my favorite shows to watch.I live all the characters and the storylines.
B007TMON8M|1.0|It never actually worked. Bought it from the Amazon app store for my A500, because my son wanted to play it. Once installed it repeatedly crashed. Uninstalled and did it again to see if maybe the package did not install properly the first time. It would start the game, but as soon as you attempted to play, it would crash again and freeze up the tablet
B007P6VM04|1.0|LISTENED TO THE DELUX VERSION AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE AND IT IS MISSING TOO MANY NUMBERS. WHOEVER PRODUCED THIS C.D. SHOULD BE ASHAMED.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|It's great to know that Lee Child's character Jack Reacher is still alive and helping rid America of bad guys. Who needs Batman when you've got a super-hero like Jack Reacher.
B003Y391V4|5.0|This sandals is very comfortable. Runs true size and the material is of good quality. I use them for the beach and everyday use
0316228532|1.0|I was terribly disappointed.  BORING and certainly not up to her creative abilities.  I hope that she will please return to what she does best.  HARRY POTTER and his future trials and tribulations.  I am 73 and Harry is one of the most fascinating series ever!  Rachel
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is just like the arcade game with a few bonus coins for a bit more fun. works well on my Kindle Fire.
B000W23H8S|5.0|I had this album as a teen. The music is great. This is the last and best album they had done. Plain and simple, it's a buy.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I've been looking forward to this book for months. Paid the $10 without batting an eye the day it came out. And this is what I got? I feel cheated.<br /><br />Gideon has even less redeeming qualities than Fifty - and that's saying something. And for all of Eva's bluster that she controls her own life, she was embarrassing with her clinginess.<br /><br />We still don't know what was with the lipstick on the shirt sleeve, which is really getting under my skin. I'm glad that Gideon told Eva about the abuse and I appreciate the detective's appearance. But both of those things were a little lackluster. Not the content of them, but the way they were deliverd. The author drug out the angst to an almost unbearable level and then only devoted 5-10 pages tops to the things that would explain?<br /><br />I only gave the book 2 stars because she did attempt to give us some answers. But in my opinion, it was all too little too late.<br /><br />Oh and a side note...I was so looking forwards to Cary taking steps towards getting his act together and try to make things right with Trey - and instead we got him trying to get Trey to agree to a permanent cheating situation. Unbelievable.<br /><br />The more I type, the more I really despise this book. I think I'll quit now.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|The best of Simon and Garfunkel, what more is there to say? I love every song on this recording and know the words to most of them. These songs bring back great memories.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book had some interesting elements but honestly I can count on one hand the # of times I've been unable to finish a book and unfortunately this is one I simply had to put down. Although the characters were intersting it seemed repetitive, long and drawn out. The back and forth flashbacks were tiresome and contributed to my lack of engagement to the story line.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The book really got to me...some things though I do wish she would have went into more detail like what did the diary tell Emily's mom....also, what in the future for Chris...over all great book!!!! A must read!!!
B006TKP2B2|1.0|The story was very disjointed. It seemed to be like it a second continuing story because some basic facts were missing.
B008ETOSYI|4.0|The Lucky One is a cute movie about a returning soldier and a divorced mom with one child.  Parts are predictable, but done well.  I enjoyed the movie for the pleasant diversion that it is.
B000S1L7IU|5.0|There is not a book that Clive Cussler writes that is not a great read.  He is a master of deception, adventure and great characters.
B00136NWLE|5.0|One of his best... wonderful body of work. This album lets you \\"travel\\" with him as he guides you down his musical highway.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As usual, an excellent read by an author who never fails to deliver. Found it to be especially riveting and difficult to put down. When's the next one?
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is a candid and moving story which was very interesting. Her story is one of hope and understanding that we are here on earth to thrive, not suffer.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Quite nice to be able to download videos especially those that one hasn't seen in years such as those one faintly remembers.  Definitely recommend the download!
0375869026|4.0|I was actually planning on downloading Rules of Civility, but this caught my interest and I ended up reading it first. Written in a way that reminded me of The Diary of a Wimpy Kid (which is also referenced in the story) it's a story that would touch any kid & adult's heart.<br /><br />August Pullman is a 10 year old kid who is about to start school for the first time. He has been home schooled for most of his life because of the number of surgeries he had to go through; he was born with a combination of facial disfigurements and refuses to describe himself in the beginning. He is observant, and picks up the slightest body language changes that occur around him, but lets on less than he perceives. Obsessed with Star wars and his xbox, he starts his first year of middle school and records his feelings and the reactions of those around him. His comments when people meet him for the first time always made me want to hug the little guy. \\"And then he noticed me\\", like I said, he knows what to watch out for, and picks it up instantly.<br /><br />The book is told from more than one person's perspective. August, his sister Via, his new friend. I loved the writing throughout most of the book but I felt like more thought went into the majority of the first part of Augusts' perspective. A few parts seemed rushed, but that did not take away from the book for me.<br /><br />The toll August's condition has on his family, and on himself; accepting who he is and learning to cope with people's reaction are all detailed here. I was reminded by a fifth grader in one of my classes once upon a time, I can't remember any obvious bullying that happened in the class, but then again, I only taught that class for around 3 months.<br /><br />A book I would definitely recommend to kids aged 10 and up, as well as adults!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I am a huge Reacher fan, but felt let down by this book which I had really been looking forward to.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Never used it before. I really do like it. Nothing to know any different. Thanks very much for Amazon. I like it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is all about you ... what you like to wear,  eat,  play with,  holidays,  crafts,  and you get to make the  catagories  .... pin it for all the world to see!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just like the arcade game,just find yourself waiting for one more coin, which leads to another and another and another
0345529057|1.0|I purchaser the books September 12, still they don't arrive. This really suck! A Song of Ice and Fire I'm still waiting :/
B006LSZECO|5.0|My friends warned me that the end was abrupt and although I completely agree with them, I loved it!!  I loved the suspense, the characters,the writing.  I could not put it down. It was truly a great book and I recommend everyone to read it. <br />Happy reading :)
B001A3GSFW|5.0|For a bunch of guys who  at the very beginning had a very dim future before them . That  lack of a true chance of having a bright future . It brought out of them  the start of a  musical revolution  and without that  reckless disreguard  for safety  they was able to thrust forward into unknown area. To which  the saventies  was lost with. Disco 20min  bullshit.  So in 3 min or less they saved the world  and forged a true new  steel
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R. R. Martin continues his excellent storytelling in The Dance of Dragons. Many unexpected twists and lots of surprises to keep you going. Can't wait for the next book.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|As usual Dexter keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what he will do next and if he will get caught.  Can't wait for the next dvd to come out.
B005K17RU0|4.0|it is a good app. The only thing that I would want to change is that the app doesn't tell what the percentage of possible rain is. But its all around a really great app
B009KUANWG|5.0|Adele is a great choice for this genre, it's becoming her signature.<br /><br /> I feel she will take the Oscar for this one. It's at least a contender, I haven't heard anything<br />else this year that's half as moving.  A  return to the original,<br />unmistakable Bond formula first made famous by Shirley Bassey.  Feel the chills as Adele<br />purrs the melody. She keeps wowing us. (She co-wrote the song)<br />My only wish is that the creative forces will release an extended version<br />with different mixes, and have one with Adele and Shirley Bassey singing together.  I think<br />their voices would blend beautifully together.  You'll be left wanting more.<br />Sort of like a passing of the torch, from one icon, to an upcoming icon.  A blessing if you will.<br />Either way you'll want this song in your collection, and love it for many years to come.<br />Adele this is your Goldfinger!<br />The best 1.29 I've ever spent.  5*****stars
