B00005JLEU|5.0|This has got to be one of the best-animated children's movies I have ever seen. I was getting so tired of the typical animated children's movies. Musicals, or poorly drawn visuals, bad voice acting, with a plot that's visible from the start, is what our movie collection was comprised of. However this movie has sort of an Alice in wonderland approach to it, but the visuals and details that go into the scenes are just amazing. I saw this after watching My Neighbor Totoro. Now I am acquiring the entire studio Gibli collection. My children just adore the characters and it is a movie that really gets their attention and not just something they watch passively. I can put this in and time and time again we just can't get bored with it. If you like this movie then you will also like \\"The Cat Returns\\".

B000007ODY|5.0|This is an easy, afforable way to get all four Brahms symphonies on two great quality cds.  Each symphony is recorded with the passion and fire you get from Brahm's music, although I have heard better recordings of the symphonies,I would still buy these cd's for the price. <br /> <br /> <br />If I have to say the worst thing about these recordings is the first movement of the third symphony is not what I was expecting ( I was expecting much more on the recording)  <br /> <br />
B0006J28L4|5.0|A stunning performance by Denzel Washington (Oscar nominated) carries this film literally into cinematic excellence. He stars as the titled character, the controversial Black Nationalist Leader who is easily one of the most interesting people who lived during the 20th Century. Spike Lee's uncompromising direction focuses on X's life. From his very early childhood to his violent death, the audience is given lots and lots of information on the character as the film runs about 195 minutes. A good supporting cast helps, but this is Washington's show from the very start.
B00009W0U4|3.0|From the start you are sent reeling as the spiraling camera work leads you down through a darkened gay sex dungeon to a scene of revenge inspired violence. The rape scene which spawns this vengeance is unflinching and brutal to the point of nausea. As the movie unwinds in reverse time the seemingly normal and unassuming events that lead up to this nightmare have a creepy subtlety, since you have already witnessed the bitter end. A harsh movie, but worth seeing as long as you take the honest depiction of such an act.
B000002H33|5.0|...you can't rightfully call yourself a metalhead. This is a classic album from the band that pretty much created thrash metal. James, Kirk, Lars and Cliff show they HAD talent at least in the 80s. Too bad this is the last album before the accident and the last with Cliff's amazing bass talents. If you call yourself a metalhead and don't own or like this, you just aren't a metalhead. This is a masterpiece and deserves every bit of respect everyone is giving it!<br /><br />1. Battery- 10/10 When I first heard this song I couldn't believe my ears. I thought to myself if the rest of the album is this good then this is gonna be one sweet album! This song is heavy and fast as hell with nice solos and one of the bands very best!<br /><br />2. Master of Puppets- 10/10! MASTER! MASTER! Master op Puppets is one hell of a song. Its no surprise that it was named the 2nd greatest heavy metal song of all time (1 behind Paranoid). It has its thrash moments, its soft moments and the final package is of something awesome! It is one of the greates heavy metal songs of all time and one of the bands best!<br /><br />3. The thing that should not be- 9/10. Ah the thing that should not be! Not the best but far from the worst. It moves a little slower than the last two but still manages to be heavy as hell! Man, every song on this album is golden!<br /><br />4. Welcome Home Snaitarium- 10/10. A classic for sure. One that everyone knows them by. I mean even Fred Durst knew what it was and that man is a d**k. Anyway, using the same chord method as they did on the Lightning album withFade to Black to make the same beautiful sound, this is one song that no one will ever forget!<br /><br />5. Disposable Heroes- 100, 000, 000, 000, 007/10. HOLY CRAP! This song rocks my socks! This is hard, heavy with great lyrics about war. This is my second favourite Metallica song ever (1 behind Creeping Death) and the best on the album. The solos will blow your mind, you will have whiplash from headbanging and if you read the lyrics they will make you say \\"WOW\\" out loud. This track is AWESOME!<br /><br />6. Lepper Messiah- 9/10. A nine out of ten is a score that mean superb and this is my least favourite track on the album. You know an album is killer when you call the worst song on the album \\"superb\\". Anyway this song is great as you know and is just more indication at the greatness to come!<br /><br />7. Orion- 10/10. Ah, just beautifully done! Really pinpoints each members talents (especially Cliff). Man oh man. I always had a hard time describing this song but all I can say is it is one of the best instumentals ever done!<br /><br />8. Damage Inc. 100/10. OH MY GOD! This one is so fast, so heavy it makes \\"Whiplash\\" look like a Beach Boys song!<br /><br />If you like this (which you should) I'd also recomend<br /><br />Metallica-Kill 'Em All, Ride the Lightning and...And Justice For Alldbanging and if you read the lyrics they will make you say \\"WOW\\" out loud.

0380789035|5.0|The first time I had heard about American Gods was during one of those typical  \\"getting-to-know-you\\" games at an atypical summer camp. The basic task of this game was to retrieve one's absolute favorite object from one's room and then to explain its personal significance. Waiting for everyone else to return, I was looking forward to getting to hear many different explanations for many different objects, when three people returned from their rooms with copies of American Gods in tow, and almost immediately began to explain animatedly how much they loved the book. It took me a year until I was smart enough to commit my money to buying a copy and reading it. That being the case, it took me less than three days to read it and fall desperately in love with it.<br /><br />Gaiman is most well known for his grasp of the fantasy genre, as especially capitalized on in his successful comic book series, The Sandman, as well as his novels and his work Mirrormask (the latter has recently been adapted into a film). Having read part of The Sandman series, I was therefore expecting to mostly see this skill on display. What actually lured me in, however, was Gaiman's fantastic writing. Gaiman has a remarkable skill with words, using a cutting, modern style of prose to best give his characters a strong, modern existence with which the reader can connect. Every aspect of Gaiman's style is complementary to his concepts and is skillful and engagingly willful, which makes the fantasy work when other authors might have failed to weave it together so well.<br /><br />The novel opens by introducing the reader to Shadow, the protagonist. Shadow is a thoughtful and pragmatic convict choosing to calmly sit out his time in jail, meeting curious characters, reading Herodotus, and waiting to be reunited with his wife. But when he is released early, it's not for any wholly pleasant reason: his wife has died in a car accident, and he's sent recover whatever life he still has waiting for him. This plan doesn't go so well, though, when on the way home he is recruited to work for a strange man who goes by the name of Wednesday, and who knows far more about the situation than Shadow does himself. After discovering the gruesome truth of his wife's death, and what little really does exist for him at the home he knew, Shadow decides to leave with Wednesday. With him, Shadow becomes involved in a climbing conflict between the personifications of the old gods of countless cultures and the new gods of commercialism, consumerism, technologies and media, as each group finds itself desperately threatened by the other.<br /><br />It is with this plot that Gaiman's skills at mixing older fantasies with modern realities manifest themselves incomparably well. Mixing mythology with circumstances typical to our day and age, the novel climbs to a fantastic, vivid climax - one not easily forgotten, and one not easily undermined.<br /><br />And I really feel I should mention, this book happens to be bliss and a half especially for mythology geeks. Norse mythology geeks even more than most, though all may apply.t go so well, though, when on the way home he is recruited to work for a strange man who goes by the name of Wednesday, and who knows far more about the situation than Shadow does himself.

B0007KTBIU|5.0|If you do not own Pocahontas and want to purchase.  Get the 10th Anniversary edition not the gold Collector's edition.  THe 10th Anniversary is a 2 disc set that is fully restored compared to the Gold Collection which looks plain bad and does not look like its only a decade old it looks like a straight port from the vhs so you will be missing out if you buy the Gold collector's edition and not the 10th Anniversary Edition.   <br /> <br />It has been my experience with Disney Dvd that you get the 2 Disc set becuase they always seem to better than the single disc counterparts.  take the limited issue series they are bare bones just liek the gold collections are so if you are a true fan of Disny you want the 2 disc sets. <br /> <br />Pocahontas is Disney's take on teh classic tale of two people trying to bridge the gap between the Native Americans and The Englis settlers but with the Disney Spin. <br /> <br />Movie is very enjoyable for all ages and remeber do not get the gold Collectors get the 10th Anniversary.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|- First, THE \\"BRING EM IN\\" ALBUM IS OUTSTANDING AND HIGHLY ENJOYABLE. Listen to sample songs on buddyguy.com and on buddyguy.net (the album is as good or better than those sample songs). This album aims to please and for the most part does. Buddy Guy's exceptional vocal and guitar performances are better than what's on some of Amazon's music top-sellers.   Let's not unfairly give the album a low rating because we have a beef with \\"real Buddy fans\\" rating the album 5 stars. Or because a few hardcore blues fans feel that some songs are too \\"mainstream\\" for their personal \\"blues taste\\". For almost 50 years, the versatile Buddy has given his diverse fans a variety of great music as well as live performances, and continues to do so today. Buddy Guy is not \\"God's gift\\" to one or two hardcore fans; he is God's gift to music and to all music lovers who have the good sense to check his music out.   - Second, Big Tony, YES, JIMI HENDRIX DID TAPE BUDDY GUY, and was partly influenced by Buddy even before meeting him. \\"Real Buddy fans\\" get their facts right and don't make up untrue facts about Buddy. The official jimi-hendrix.com website reported on Buddy (who was the headline act) at Jimi Hendrix's 60th birthday tribute concert: \\"With the audience now worked to fever pitch, Bob Hendrix called Buddy Guy to the stage. The concept of Guy, whose classic sides for Chess Records had influenced Hendrix during his early career, performing with Jimi's Band Of Gypsys was eagerly anticipated by all. Bob Hendrix summed it up perfectly when he explained that THE HENDRIX FAMILY WAS CALLING ON A LEGEND (BUDDY GUY) TO CELEBRATE A LEGEND (JIMI HENDRIX). Guy told the crowd of first meeting Hendrix at a 1968 jam session in a New York nightclub. Hendrix asked if he could record the proceedings on a Nagra tape recorder that had been supplied to him by filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker. 'Who are you?' queried Guy. Hendrix introduced himself and would later join Guy onstage.\\" Furthermore, the Buddy Guy's Legends club (Chicago) has a TV playing the film clip of Hendrix taping Buddy's stage performance. In addition, the Martin Scorsese blues concert movie \\"Lightning In A Bottle\\" has another clip of Hendrix sitting in the front-row audience grooving to Buddy showmanship on stage! Hendrix himself has said \\"heaven is sitting at Buddy Guy's feet and listening to him play guitar,\\" and that he cancelled his own concert to go see the blues master perform. Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jeff Beck, Keith Richards and many other \\"guitar superstars\\" have also said Buddy was a big influence on rock music and on them.
B000002HRE|1.0|I still remember Metallica's \\"Reload\\" album coming out in '97.  It was hyped by the media, but this time they wouldn't fool me.  I was a sucker when I bought the black cd six years earlier in '91; there was no way I was going to get fooled again.  Fool me once shame on you--fool me twice, shame on me! <br /> <br />Just listen to \\"The Unforgiven II\\" and compare it to any of their 80s songs.  The difference is shocking!  On their 80s albums, James has an aggressive vocal style as fierce as a lion ripping its prey to pieces.  He was a metal GOD.  But on their Load albums, all that howling he used to do has been replaced by strained and awkward groans; <br /> <br />\\"What I feeeeeeeaaaaaaaarrrrrred!  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH what I've knooooooooowwwwwoooooonnnnn!\\" <br /> <br />I mean, this dude sounds like he just stubbed his toe or something!  I've never heard a sound more annoying than James Hetfield crooning these alternative rock power ballads!  What was he thinking?  Metallica was once a great band with an epic metal style.  And then they threw it all away just so they could have a hit on top 40 radio?  Poor Cliff Burton must be turning over in his grave every time \\"The Unforgiven II\\" is played on the radio or MTV. <br /> <br />The Unforgiven II--oh how I hate that song!  But its just one utterly bad alt-rock power ballad on an equally horrible record.  It is surrounded by other songs that are even more annoying than it is.  It looks like James must have been trying to get into the Guiness Book of World Records in the \\"Most Annoying Voice Ever\\" category.  Hearing him blurt out \\"GIVE ME FUEL GIVE ME FIRE GIVE ME THOU WHICH I DESIRE!!!!\\" at the begining of the idiotic ditty \\"Fuel\\" makes me envy the deaf!  The rest of that song has some mind numbing repetitive riffs that drive me up the wall, and it makes me wonder how Kirk could lower himself to this level.  He used to shred on those early albums!  His speed demon soloing was a staple of their sound.  Now he's been reducedto this?  Something tells me that he could have quit the band (which wouldn't have been such a bad idea, considering how awful their 90s output was) and we wouldn't have even noticed him gone. <br /> <br />If you're a Metallica fan who loves \\"Master of Puppets\\" or \\"Ride the Lightning\\" stay away from their 1990s albums.   Metallica totally lost their sound when they let greed get in the way of musical quality.  Sure this stuff was popular on MTV and top 40 radio, but it was still awful.  This album is a cancer on the body of heavy metal.  The songs on it are nothing but complete and pointless noise pollution, and I wouldn't reccomend it to you, let alone anybody else...garbage!
B0001Z52RU|1.0|I loved this movie, but missed a lot of the dialogue as I have hearing disabilities.  the information above and on the back cover clearly state they include english subtitles, but there were none.  I later found out Infinifilm omitted subtitles on many of their releases of movies.  I can only watch this by having someone tell me what folks just said.  VERY disappointed.  they need to update the data above to remove the inclusion of subtitles...
B0000255CL|5.0|many people give 5 stars in a rather nonchalant manner completly nulling the value of the prestigious 5. This cd is the most essential black metal album I've ever come across.

B00004C8TC|5.0|These two romantic concertos are grandly dramatic exemplars of that era.  The playing on this CD appropriately communicates that drama in crystal clear sound.  I have heard the Schumann in several versions and consider this the best of the lot.  Recommended without reservations.
B0001CCXY8|4.0|the fastest most brutal most technical guitar playing on this planet. Not music in traditional sense of the word, but if you play an instrument this is fundamental. I wish I could yell like the corpsegrinder I would be in a super market and make people think there is a slaughterhouse nextdoor:) that'd be fun ehh? Hate to make such a short review for a good album but reading any review of wretched spawn is a waste of time: just buy it
0380789019|3.0|This book was good--don't get me wrong. It had adequate characters, some interesting points, and could have been really great. However, the most glowing praise I can find for it is that it's appropriate.<br /><br />The character of Richard Mayhew reminds me a bit too much of Arthur Dent, and Douglas Adams did the character MUCH better. Richard fails to sustain my interest and while I pity him occasionally, he doesn't surprise me or make me want to know more about him. Door was also an appropriate character. She said just what she was supposed to say to keep the plot moving and that was about it. She wasn't all that interesting and seemed kind of anticlimactic. All of the other characters earned very much the same assessment that Door recieved: They pushed the plot along and helped tie it into a neat little bow at the end. That's it.<br /><br />It wasn't bad, certainly, but it wasn't great. It could have used some soul in the characters and a plot that was slightly less predictable. A good read, but nothing mind-boggling.
0446310786|5.0|I had to read this novel for my Advanced Placement English class. It was actually something which I loved. Incredible... Harper Lee's novel is a timeless telling of a battle with morality and ethics during the Depression. Major events include Scout and Jem's developments as human beings, with the senses of justice, morality, and self that are integral to the personal psyche; Tom Robinson's accusation, trial, and death, as well as experiences with and the aftermath of these events; and Bob Ewell's hell-bent campaign of revenge against discreditors, along with Atticus' eternally optimistic, comforting presence. <br />SCOUT <br />Scout Finch begins her journey in To Kill A Mockingbird as a naive, childish, innocent 5-year-old who is dependent upon those who surround her: Jem, Atticus, and others. When we leave her, she has become more mature, contemplative, and significantly independent in mental areas. Although she still needs Atticus and Jem, Scout's realization of injustice and her ability to \\"climb into [a person's] skin and walk around in it\\" (30) effectively fulfills the moral ambition which Harper Lee had set for the character. <br />JEM <br />Jeremy Finch begins the novel as much more mature than his younger sister. However, his journey is no less dramatic. Jem's major developments are in the areas of justice and morals. He was deeply immersed in the trial of Tom Robinson, whose verdict and human loss corrupted his new, inexperienced morals. Via Atticus and the good ol' time, the reader is confident that Jem's pysche will recover. <br />ATTICUS <br />Scout and Jem are highly dependent upon their father, who is the basis upon which they are able to morally and mentally develop. Atticus himself, as the foundation, is unwavering. He does not develop so much as details are revealed about him via circumstances that develop the others. If Bob Ewell is the Devil in the novel, Atticus is the always-good Christ figure. <br /> <br />LOSS OF INNOCENCE <br />The main theme, which is so deeply entwined in the novel that it is the source of the title, is the loss of innocence theme. In chapter 10, Atticus, the eternal voice of reason and conscience, tells Scout that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. This is reaffirmed on several occasions. The theme involves a \\"mockingbird,\\" or a completely innocent, uncorrupted person, being somehow damaged and hurt by an evil force that casuses them to lose their joy. Mockingbirds in the novel include Dill, Scout (who is able to maintain her optimism), and Jem (who is perhaps not so lucky), as well as Tom Robinson. However, the greatest example of all is that of Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, an energetic, enigmatic boy who was damaged psychologically by an abusive, neglectful father to the point of exile and withdrawal into himself. <br />RACISM <br />There are many who consider To Kill A Mockingbird's discussion of racism to be taboo and thus have challenged the book. However, the trial of Tom Robinson, an event so central to the novel, is governed by Depression-era Southern prejudice, which includes use of the N-word to provide authenticity. THe message of the book is one of denouncing racism, and is thus integral to the development of anti-prejudice beliefs in the reader's psyche, not to mention for Jem and Scout. <br />CRITIQUE OF ORTHODOX EDUCATION <br />Harper Lee shows her dislike for orthodox education in two main events. First, Miss Caroline's methods of teaching are shown to be ineffective and encourage Scout to not read until she's supposed to be able to. Atticus, who Lee has established as the voice of right, tells Scout to keep reading, which shows favor for individual development. The second event is the current events sequence, during which Lee claims the objectives of forced public speaking are useless. She is clearly in opposition to the apparent advantages of \\"being singled out [and made] more than ever anxious to return to the Group\\" (243) and the theory that the general populace is more important than one person. This may be part of the reason that To Kill A Mockingbird reflects the very individual developments of Scout and Jem. <br />OPTIMISM VS. PESSIMISM <br />The novel itself is littered with negative, pessimistic events. The greatest of these is undoubtedly racism, and the townspeople's collective inability to identify and deal with their own prejudice. Countering these events are such things as a three-hour jury deliberation and protection of life by an unexpected hero. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This is certainly true of the novel: Boo Radley will kill them, Boo Radley saves their lives. Maycomb is racist, Scout and Jem are able to use that to develop their morals. However, there are no existences of Maycomb that are so completely different from each other than the existences of Bob Ewell and Atticus Finch. If Bob Ewell wears red horns, Atticus wears a halo, and it is his unceasing presence that comforts his children. Atticus protects justice, innocence, and goodness, and it is no coincidence that in the end it is Bob who is dead and Atticus who thrives. VERDICT: Optimism. <br />PERSONAL OPINION <br />It is quite rare that I enjoy examining and dissecting a novel when forced to. TO Kill A Mockingbird is one of those rare books. I enjoyed it as a novel, which has eternally been my main objective. I also very much liked reading into the various morals of the story and learning about the theories and philosophies that Lee had presented. <br />As a novel, I found it to be controversial, stimulating, educational and well-written. While I admire Atticus for his parenting, sense of justice, morality, disregard for absolute propriety, and optimism without naivete, I found his character to be flawed but a little too Christlike. The same applies to Bob Ewell: nobody is that entirely evil, and for Lee to portray him as such was unrealistic. All in all, though, it was an interesting read. <br /> <br />There has been much discussion about the use of the N-word, especially by people on this board, including one named D.Thill. While I understand the desire to protect young children from offensive language, perhaps parents such as this person should take into account the maturity it takes to read this novel and to comprehend the objectives behind the use of the word. It provides authenticity; for Lee to not include it would not be honoring her own artistic vision. It has nothing to do with a lack of vocabulary. Perhaps such an individual should review their own grammatical abilities and comprehension in order to then understand Lee's brilliance.  <br /> <br />The discussion over whether or not the morals of this novel are relevant nowadays ... it's dispicable. I am in an AP English class. Clearly, the Canadian AP board considers this novel to be important. Whether or not the Americans are too offended by a telling of their own sordid history remains to be seen. Not discredting Faulkner or other incredible authors, To Kill A Mockingbird deserves just as much.  <br />Children are not stupid; especially in a society such as today's, exposing them to a piece of classic literature that deals with the controversial events is perhaps the best thing that could be done. Perhaps people would rather children learn about these things from TV or movies, where the messages so clearly outlined in this novel may be distorted.
0380789035|4.0|I gave \\"Stardust\\" a try and found it an adequate piece of fiction that didn't really tip my mental canoe. I gave \\"Neverwhere\\" a try, and found it very appropriate. Everything progressed just how I thought it would and it ended rather neatly. Completely unimpressed with Neil Gaiman, but not completely turned away, I decided to give \\"American Gods\\" a try and I'm certainly glad I did.<br /><br />While it smacks of \\"Neverwhere\\" a bit too much for me, the characterization is so fresh in comparison that I forced myself not to notice the glaring similarities in plot lines. Gaiman is hardly my personal god and I find him to be far, far overrated, but \\"American Gods\\" was a very satisfying read.<br /><br />I loved Shadow. I thought he was a wonderful character. I loved how he was a spot of glowing stoicism in a great, swirling, sea of absolute chaos. Plunged into the fray, he came out with his head still above water. Without Shadow, I probably would have put this book down after the first 100 pages or so and given up Gaiman as a lost cause.<br /><br />Gaiman's subtle interplay of old gods and new gods, and his interpretation of the new gods of American culture was extremely interesting and I appreciate his treatment of old gods adapting to a new world.<br /><br />He is still far from being my favorite author, although I would certainly read this book again. I find that his writing is generally predictable and he's at his best when he's mixed with Terry Pratchett. Because \\"American Gods\\" was so similar in structure to \\"Neverwhere\\" I couldn't give this a full five stars. There were some parts that dragged and other parts that weren't fully fleshed out, but it was overall a very pleasant book.
B000002LFU|4.0|Sure, it was sappy at times, but Green was not as terrible an album as its reputation makes it out to be. <br /> <br />Ok, Get Up was stupid and Stand, well, is a good song as long as you do not put \\"R.E.M.\\" in front of that sentiment. Pop Song 89 was (sadly) a fairly decent song, maybe because of the self-deprecation of the song shown in the title. But take away these three songs, you got a tipically good R.E.M. album. <br /> <br />World Leader Pretend is one of those songs that grow on you, following in the tradition of numerous previous non-hits by R.E.M., most notably Perfect Circle and Maps and Legends (although Perfect Circle was a great song in my opinion the first time I played it, the only non-hit R.E.M. song to not have to grow on me). Orange Crush was a deserving hit, following its way up the charts like The One I Love, although not as high. <br /> <br />The Wrong Child grows on you more than any of the other 6 songs on the album. Most R.E.M. songs do grow on you, with the aforementioned growing the most. The Wrong Child is another one of those songs with a good message, but not nearly as sappy and overplayed as the later Everybody Hurts. <br /> <br />You Are the Everything and I Remember California are nice songs, although not brilliant. However, they are anything but filler. Turn You Inside Out is another good song, as is Hairshirt. The untitled track 11 is also a pretty good song. <br /> <br />Sure, this album is not even in the same league as the I.R.S. albums, but it is also no Reveal or Monster. This and New Adventures in Hi Fi are both often maligned and unfairly. Sure, they are not the best albums by the best group of the last 25 years, but they are both very solid albums. <br /> <br />And P.S., Stand is, in fact, a guilty pleasure of mine. I gave it 4* on Windows Media Player. I know, I should not admit it....

B0006L16N8|4.0|In this latest outing, Coldplay reinforce their ability to produce radio songs that translate into all cultures and languages while remaining truely English. <br /> <br />How have they changed? Production is the answer. This album sees songs that are slightly less polished and a little more wild at heart but production that trims them back into a purist form. This works well on some songs but on others leaves them a little lacking. The guitars of Buckland have been pushed back in the mix on this album and the melody slimed. It mostly works and like Rush of Blood it grows on you and wins you over more with every play. <br /> <br />A thread of 80's british guitar rock runs through this album (Square one, White Shadows, Talk)but blends with ballads (What if, Fix you, Kingdom come) and Coldplays own classic sound in Speed of sound. <br /> <br />I still hope that the next album lets a bit of the rough through in the mix and allows the band some space to be their own band. <br /> <br />Buy it, you won't regret it.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is an excellent cd by Slipknot. Some say that they have gone mainstream, or sold themselves out. I disagree. It still great music with great vocals, guitar, drums, everything. About the only thing that has changed is that they don't cuss every other word which isn't necessarily something that makes a cd good. I believe this cd has shown the maturity of Slipknot in their music. Oh, and to everyone that says that Slipknot are posers are full of crap. How can they be posers when they are original in their music. They don't copy their music from anyone. Sure they may have gotten the mask idea from another band, but that is just their image. You can't say crap about the music of a band because everyone does things a little differently. Even when someone does a cover of a band, it never sounds the same as the original band. So... Slipknot Rocks, Buy this cd, and don't diss the awesomeness of an original band.
B000002U82|5.0|When I first picked this album up, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it.  This stood true for quite a while, but one thing that I was totally sure of pretty early on was that this album is a GRAND production.  It's sweeping and cinematic in its range and scope, but the painfully obvious attempts at building dramatic tension by using special effects are not very impressive, especially after the first couple of listens.  And really, they are mostly unnecessary.  The music itself does a wonderful job of illustrating everything that the band wants to get across in vivid detail.  This melancholy album is grand in its scope and incredibly even in tone and timbre...for the most part.  The song that most people who have never heard this album are likely familiar with, \\"Money\\", is the only one of its kind on this album.  You won't find any other hard electric blues riffs here, but the musicianship as a whole really is consistently outstanding throughout this entire album.  Roger Waters' lyrics are extremely effective too.  This album is full of moody, dramatic crescendo filled songs that start off slow and build into some sort of dramatic climax, and the band is really effective at achieving what they seem to set out to achieve as artist.  Just take \\"Us and Them\\" which is basically the album's centerpiece for example.  This multi-layered song with everything from an outstanding rhythm section to some cool sax, at first smoothly drifts but then powerfully soars into a dramatic climax.  The band seems to seek for this to have some sort of cathartic effect for the listener, and I can't think of a better way to describe the experience of listening to it.  This can basically be said of the entire album.  The combination of \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse\\" are a great way to end the album off.  \\"Brain Damage\\" strongly alludes to The Beatles' \\"Dear Prudence\\", using almost the same melody played out in almost the same way but in a slightly different key and at a slightly different tempo.  Overall, this is a pretty melancholy, almost sullen piece of work that is highly effective at exploring the darker hue of the world, the human mind, etc.  There are all sorts of interesting dynamics throughout that add to the albums effectiveness.  I don't think that this album is so much really dark as it is just very dim in tone and texture, and sometimes, that may be just what you need.  This is the perfect album to reach for during those times.  The first half is somewhat hampered due to all of the special effects and empty space that really disrupts the album's flow, but overall, this is a really solid piece of work.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|This cd is definitely the best Slipknot cd out. I have the digipack version which I believe to be a little better than the original. Get this and Despise are two tracks that I think should have been on the original version of the cd. They are very well done. Some of the demos are lame on there, but that version of the Self Titled cd is definitely worth the little bit of extra money. If your a true fan of Slipknot, buy it!

B0000630BT|5.0|Okay, everybody and anybody that knows Judas Priest will tip their metal hats to the classic Priest sounds like British Steel, Screaming for Vengeance, Hell Bent for Leather and so on. I, being alongside \\"everybody\\" and anybody\\" will tip my hat in the same gesture with the same respect. However, I always knew deep down inside that they were not reaching their fullest potential. British Steel, Screaming, Defenders and Ram It Down were all excellent releases in their own right, however, there was always something lacking. Guitarists Tipton and Downing have never slumped on the riffs save for Turbo (don't EVEN get me started on that album...), but they were almost stagnant in a sense till Painkiller came out. The solution? they changed drummers. Dave Holland left with his trademark rock and roll rhythms and in comes Scott Travis with a HEAVY METAL DOUBLEKICK ROAR TO THE 5TH POWER!!!!  <br />The album, for being a product of the early 90's, stand strong to this day. Excellent production all around. The vocals are strong and VERY effective( I just love the delay used on the vocal..superb!) and of course as mentioned the drumming is top notch. the skull crushers being Painkiller, All gunz Blazing, Nightcrawler Leather Rebel (DAMN...doesn't Scott get tired drumming this way...for those unaware of this album...listen to this track...you'll hear what I'm talking about)and of course, the peak of the album...Metal Meltdown with a traditional english/metal dual Priest guitar trade off a la Tipton/Downing. Talk about RIPPING chops!!!!!!!! The rest of the album is no slump either and they even get a little commercial with Touch of Evil (the hit from the album...), but not commercial like Turbo was or nothing like Breakin' the LAw or the other \\"hits\\". This is commercial in a dark/ Priest kind of way. <br />So as always, when I review a release, I compare it to a previous one or ones...in terms of popularity, it's not British Steel or Screaming...but that's okay....that's a good thing. I LOVE those albums with a passion, BUT this is a perfect example of Delivering the Goods. Every pun intended(classic Priest fans will get it...). <br />The only thing I have to pick on about this album is Glenn Tipton. Talk about a guitar solo HOG!!! The credits list which guitarist plays what on each song and his work far outweights Downings. His solos are WAY, WAY longer and when Downing does get a few bars of solo in...there comes Tipton with his two cents. I'm sure it only seems this way, and Glenn's chops were more en vogue at that time, but jeez, c'mon Glenn!!! He's always been this way though and it's well documented. But situations like this is a badly kept heavy metal secret. Ratt and Aerosmith are other examples of bigheaded lead guitarists...although there is one that stands out a little more, the underrated one is perfectly capable of delivering great lead work in their own right.But the cool thing is, there are some of us that can see the picture as a whole...and I think that the underrated ones know that there are those that appreciate THEIR work.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Coldplay's \\"X&Y\\" doesn't quite equal their breakout album, 2002's \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" but in many ways, it's more interesting.  With a few notable exceptions, Chris Martin and company refuse to rest on their considerable laurels, instead endeavoring to expand and diversify their sound.  There are explorations into art rock, electronic, and traditional music - some successful, others not quite so. Brian Eno makes a guest appearance, and there are excerpts of a Kraftwerk song.  For the most part, Coldplay refuses to play it safe, instead forging ahead with their development as a band and musicians. <br /> <br />The first five songs range from the pulsating opening track \\"Square One,\\" the gently building, introspective \\"What If,\\" the multilayered \\"White Shadows,\\" the dramatic \\"Fix You,\\" and the catchy \\"Talk.\\"  \\"Fix You\\" is undoubtedly the centerpiece of \\"X&Y\\" and arguably Coldplay's best song ever. If your spine doesn't tingle when the bridge's driving guitar riff begins, check your pulse! <br /> <br />After the first five songs, Coldplay veers dangerously close to filler territory.  The title track and \\"Message\\" call to mind the soporific strains of their 2000 debut, \\"Parachutes.\\"  \\"Hardest Part\\" is a fairly generic rock number that sounds like it could have been written by anyone.  On the other hard, there's \\"Speed of Sound,\\" which is pretty much a rewrite of the band's 2002 smash hit, \\"Clocks.\\"  It's a pretty egregious rehash; you can sing most of \\"Clocks'\\" lyrics to \\"Speed of Sound\\" (try it!) <br /> <br />Fortunately, Coldplay ends \\"X&Y\\" with several strong tracks. There's \\"Low,\\" which starts with a Superdrag-like driving guitar, features that Eno midsection, and ends with a heavy-duty climax.  The band also reveals a folksy side with \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" and a hidden track, disguised in the listing here as \\"+\\" but introduced in concert as \\"Till Kingdom Come,\\" a tribute to Johnny Cash. <br /> <br />Martin explores his vocal range with a tentative and erratic falsetto; he's not quite as accomplished a vocalist as Keane's Tom Chaplin or even Radiohead's Thom Yorke, who exert better command over their voices. But what Martin lacks in technique, he makes up for in heartfelt emotion.  His voice exudes a warm familiarity that comforts the listener. <br /> <br />\\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" earned Coldplay a place among rock's elite bands; \\"X&Y\\" shows they deserve to stay there.

B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's debut album \\"Ten\\" rightly stands among the greatest rock albums ever made. The pure artistic creativity inherent in each groundbreaking song is sadly lacking in most of the new music being played on the airwaves today. Each song has its own individuality and personality, ripping through my stereo speakers with some of the most intelligent and poetical lyrics ever to grace the world of rock n roll since Roger Waters or Jim Morrison. Eddie Vedder sings in operatic vocals brilliantly crafted songs about serial killers (Once..), abortion, teenage violence, child abuse, and love gone awry over dirty distorted guitars infused with blusey solos from Mike McCready. This is Pearl Jam at their youngest, at their darkest, and at their most powerfully emotional.

B000002NIW|5.0|\\"Around the Fur\\". Now, when most hear this phrase (men), sexual ideals overtake the reader/listener.  To those who like their music to cut like a razor, one act comes to mind...the Deftones. Talk about the roughest most anger inducing music, it'll have you clubbing baby seals in no time (jk). You can kill an hour of cleaning or working out with the entire C.D. Vocals that are eerie, dark then in your face accompanied by guitar rifts and percussion that'd persuade grandma herself to rush the \\"pit.\\" <br /> \\"My Own Summer,\\" their first single for radio; set records in 1996 for most radio airplay/singles sales, that still stand today. This one track depicts their vocals and style you can find on their first Album through today. This sophmore album really launched the Deftones into the mainstream asserting their status as legends of rock. \\"Head Up,\\" faster and more rigid, is a proverbial Ultimate Fighting Match for the ears. <br />  Got an all night \\"Halo2\\" or Soulcaliber 2\\" tournament to dominate? Any and all tracks from this disc, jamming on your I-pod will invoke the warrior within you.  All your, so called opponents, will find the evening filled with shame and disgrace. Guaranteed. For best battles mixes, also include \\"Staind's, Dysfunction\\" and \\"Pantera's, Far Beyond Driven\\".   One sided will be all that can be said of your matches for the evening. Deftones rock.
B0000640VO|5.0|I will use context of this movie to confess the reason why I am most drawn to read the lowest ranking reviews regarding movies like this one.     I have learned and confirmed a lot from people giving bad ratings and mocking reviews to masterpieces just as this one.  The most important thing confirmed is, first of all,  the unavoidable fact that that individuals percieve things through the lens of their own personalities, through the eyes of their inner being,  eyes which scope ranges from the sensitive and candid perception of a curious INNER CHILD, open to details, open to that which is trascendental and radiating.        And then...we also find those writing mocking reviews and  sharing the sensitivity of a HIT-AND-RUN truck driver who has just rolled his 18 wheels over his \\"INNER BRAT\\", while burping the \\"FIVE STAR\\" effect of a cold \\"BUD\\"....     Upon more time deserving descriptions, AMELIE  is a movie about the respective  liberation and fulfillment of a girl's inner fears and dreams, although more than a character, she is an icon. The wonderful thing about it all is that in the process she understands she may not achieve this without trying to help all those around her achieve this same liberation in their own particular way. Or at least the ilusion of that liberation,  the uplifting ilusion of hope.   It is difficult to describe.     Quietly Ignore those mockingly derogative \\"EIGHTEEN-WHEELED\\" reviews!

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|My it's been a long time since we last got some music from this band. 2001's \\"Toxicity\\" was easily one of the records of the year, and with the pressure to follow up such a successful album, SOAD has more than answered the challenge with 2005's Mezmerize. The riffs are tight and in place, the band has a revitalized sense of energy, and their political views and rants are just as loud as they were on any previous album. To put it plainly, this is one of 2005's must own records. <br /> <br />The first thing that will be noticed about the band on this recording is that guitarist Daron Malakian now sees even more time on the mic than on any previous release. Now undoubtably this could be a bad thing, because it's taking time away from the great (and extremely unique) vocal stylings of Serj, but in System of a Down's case, the combination works well. Serj and Daron compliment eachother perfectly, and at certain points the vocals meld together for some memorable melodies. Musically the band isn't all that different from anything you've grown accustomed to in the past. However the best part of the band has always been the great music they write, and this album is no different. Leading off with short, and mellowing \\"Soldier Side - Intro\\" and then quickly into \\"B.Y.O.B\\", SOAD takes no prisoners. You'll quickly notice the thundering rhythm section of Shavo Odadjian and John Dolmayan, who have grown even more impressive over the four years since \\"Toxicity\\". Daron's guitar playing is top notch, and once again creates some unique and original thrash inspired riffs that we've all come to love. Serj gives as strong a vocal performance as he has on any release, showcasing his diverse range of abilities like never before. The combined efforts of the band (who are definitely at their best) takes songs like \\"Cigaro\\" and \\"Question!\\" to astonishing levels. There's plenty of change-ups through out the record though to keep a diverse listen, mainly tunes like \\"Radio/Video\\" and \\"Lost In Hollywood\\". However the record as a whole is quite a good listen. The lyrics, which have always been one of the strongest points of the band, are above and beyond what the band has offered before. It seems Bush's re-election and the war in Iraq has given them plenty to write about, and they do it without coming off preachy, or too political, which is quite an accomplishment. <br /> <br />\\"Hypnotize\\", which is apparently the second part of this record is supposed to be hitting stores in November, and if this is any idication of what is to come, I really can't wait to see what this band is going to present us with on the next release. \\"Mezmerize\\" is all you could the band to deliver, and then some. Considering that most of the bands that were coming out when System of A Down debuted are no longer making music, the fact that this band is still around is quite a commendable feat. This is by far one of the strongest releases I've heard thus far this year, and is sure to be at the top of the list for 2005's rock recordings. Do your self a favor, and check this one out ASAP.
B0002O37RM|1.0|I bought this album because I love Charlie Haden's tone, and was impressed by the inclusion of the very fast playing alto saxist Miguel Zenon and pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba in the credits. <br />But why were they hired? There's hardly any need in the bland arrangements for more than competent amateurs. It certainly needs a singer and a rocket up the band. <br />I am so puzzled by the five star reviews that I went back and switched on the CD. The track I picked at random was nice, but I couldn't face a second, and played a Fall record instead to wake me up. I shall try again, but it seems a bit dreary.  <br />
B0000JCFPE|3.0|Sharon Stone ignited the screen with her sidereal, enigmatic and alluring beauty that constituted the dorsal spine of a film sumptuously produced, brilliantly illuminated that would seem to oscillate between the Noir Film and an existential erotic thriller.<br /><br />The sexual ambiguities of this female writer and the hot scenes nevertheless, do not guarantee a total and happy journey. The script has many holes and the mistaken director acting on Michael Douglas would constitute for him the image of the disturbed and harassed man in future films of doubtful quality.<br /><br />The serious problem that I have with this film is the lack of profundity, once you have decided to face such attractive and fascinating breach. It would seem the hidden dragons of the script would have clashed against the invisible walls of the Puritanism , becoming in a true dilemma that will lead us to an awful anticlimax. Once you open the gate, prepare the torch and get inside this hell assuming the consequences and extract major implications than a simple and pleasant Video clip of long duration  but please, don' t pretend to make an erotic fable with the only purpose to convince us about the undeniable attractive of Sharon Stone. All of us are more than convinced about it.<br /><br />Two other films have walked the same footpath: 9 ½ weeks and Indecent proposal. Both films can not transcend the superficiality and the trivial anecdote.<br /><br />If you required me about other similar films that bet hard an won, I would name two remarkable ones. In 1985 Nicholas Roeg directed an outstanding film: Bad timing, that explores the sinister labyrinths around a non conventional love affair with deep implications. On the other hand, it is good to appoint Robert van Ackeren directed in 1984 a -pitifully- a not so well known film of nocturnal beauty and enraptured violence: The woman in flames with the exuberant Gudrun Langrebe.<br /><br />Here you have two striking  examples about what I mean.

B00006G8K0|5.0|Terence Fisher directed this outstanding picture supported by the best and most reminded Dracula in the cinema story -Christopher Lee-as the Count and Van Helsing featured by Peter Cushing. The excellent reworking of Bram Stoker ` s classic story has never been best expressed on the screen. A genuine classic and with all security the best entry of  the multiple versions.<br /><br />We should expect for most of thirty years for the hallucinating and very personal approach of Coppola , but despite of the fact of so many technological devices and admirable performances there are certain details (the presence of Keanu Reeves simply did not fit at all and it was a serious default), and the excesive overindulgent treatment that weakens seriously the main character, and definitively is far to reach this legendary achievement.

B0001ZMWQO|2.0|.......i jsut dont get it. or maybe i do. It seemed inevitable that music like this would sneak into the mainstream since evrybody got sick of nu-metal and post-grunge, but sadly Franz Ferdinand skeltal sound doesnt really fill the void. the album is scattered with sloppy guitar noise,lifeless drumming, and the-oh-sop-hip vocals that really doesnt sound like singing so much as accent laden talking, and the intentionally bad production doesnt make you anymore a credible band either. Looking beyond that the band does have in mnind to try to very at leats make memorable songs..but instead though it all sounds forced. The riffs arent memorable, and  the fact this stuff can be considered dancable is mind blowing. While bands like the Killers dont make songs anymore memorable or skill anymore skillful they at least have the temporary knack to make there songs radiate with listenablity and sometimes make actually dancable. Franz FErdinad sound is too rough and too sloppy to make anyone bsides indie rock hipsters go flipping backwards over this

That would be a misappropriation.
630463949X|5.0|This was my first DVD years ago and I looked through the reviews and couldn't believe that I hadn't written a review for this outstanding DVD. <br />Thank God that you can't wear out these DVD's from overuse, or this one would have been gone years ago!  When the DVD craze was just beginning, and I was one of the first to own one, I would show this DVD to friends and this would be enough for them to join the DVD movenment (rather than VHS).  So really, this DVD was probably responsible for DVD sales going up in my circle of friends. <br />I didn't have a DTS system at the time, so I used my Bose surround system with Pro Logic and this was still great!  The songs were all done with a very professional edge and the surprise near the end was especially great, with the USC marching band.   <br />I've seen this band live since seeing this DVD and I have to tell you that live is very good, but I prefer the DVD for the most part (except for the atmosphere).  No crowds to fight, parking is not an issue, and you can stop and start it at your own leisure.  <br />There's something to say for having a great DVD of a fantastic band, with all of their signature songs, at your disposal.  It was the reason I got a DVD player to begin with.  You can't go wrong with this DVD being one of your MUST HAVE in your collection!
B000A6T1JU|2.0|If you wanted any clearer indication that Director's Cut DVD's aren't always a great idea, look no further than this \\"ultimate\\" reworking of The Warriors, a wonderfully pure piece of high concept cinema from the late 70's that has been transformed - by a director clearly out of his mind in thinking this kind of inane pretentiousness would improve matters - into comic-booky codswallop. Literally.  <br /> <br />If you've been paying attention to the one-star reviews that are flooding these pages, you're now aware that the new cut enhances what Walter Hill sees as the story's comic book origins (when in fact it was adapted from a novel) by inserting actual comic book-style panels as scene transitions, complete with dialogue balloons and \\"Meanwhile...\\" tags. But even worse than this is a new intro, which announces to one and all the roots of the story in the works of Greek historian Xenophon. It does this with bad, bad, BAD drawings (I was a comic book artist for ten years, so trust me, I know bad comic art), and narration from Hill himself that is in *grammatically incorrect English*!! Get this: it begins, \\"Over two millenniums ago...\\" WTF? \\"Millenniums\\"? Unless we're also seeing a new \\"Ultimate Director's Cut\\" of the English language, as far as I recall the plural of \\"millennium\\" is \\"millennia\\". A veteran writer/director like Walter Hill can't even put his hands on a frickin' DICTIONARY? <br /> <br />Now, I'm generously granting an extra star for the bonus documentaries because they actually are pretty decent. We learn a lot about the difficulties with the shoot. Most of the original cast has been reassembled. We learn interesting bits of trivia, like the fact that Luther's famous taunt \\"Warriorrrrrs, come out to plaaaay-aaayyy\\" was improvised by that actor right there on the set. Or that the Baseball Furies' makeup was inspired by Kiss. We don't hear enough about the real life post-release controversy, such as the gang violence that really erupted during some screenings. But overall, the docs are worth seeing for fans of the movie. <br /> <br />I do give thumbs down for no deleted scenes section. The well-known alternate opening, set during the day with Cleon's girlfriend begging him not to go to Cyrus's meeting is seen only in clips in one of the docs. They should have included it in its entirety, the way that the Escape From New York SE included the entire deleted bank robbery and capture opening. (I do agree, BTW, with the decision to keep it out of the final cut. The movie's structure from night to day gives it a perfectly consistent atmosphere. To go from day to night back to day would have been a less effective choice.) <br /> <br />As for a commentary, okay, if Hill doesn't like them he doesn't have to do one. But why not the cast, or the producers, or some well-known critic who's a fan of the film? Really a letdown. <br /> <br />The best I can recommend is renting this just to see the docs if you're a big fan of the movie. But if you already own the previous movie-only DVD from a few years ago, FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T GET RID OF IT.
B0000C8AW7|3.0|Yes.  We are all glad Bob Dylan is alive and this album is pretty good.  3 Stars good.  It is not Bringing it all Back Home...certainly not Highway 61...and nowhere near Blood on the Tracks or Desire.  Drink a bottle of wine and it sounds better.  I am glad to own it...but I am so tired of the false accolades to an album that may not make the top 10 Bob Dylan albums.  DITTO ON TIME OUT OF MIND....
6305558167|4.0|Even though this moving is over 20 years old(most apparent by the \\"old\\" special effects with the lady of the lake), it still has presence.  If you are an avid \\"King Arthur\\" fan, you will appreciate this version of the story.  It's not glamorous, It's \\"real\\".  The period costumes and sets are excellent, John Boorman did a great adaptation of \\"Le Morte de Authur\\" in my humble opinion.
B000002C2E|3.0|Yes we are glad Bob Dylan is still alive.  Yes this is a good album - and I am glad to own it.  But let's get beyond that hype - this is not one of his best...not nearly.  Ignore the reviews.  Drink a bottle of wine to increase the rating from 3 stars to 4.  Lyrics are ok.  Music is too.  Great example of the lacklustre nature ...listen to the last track Highlands (16:27) - it goes on forever.  Wow...sounds REMARKABLY like \\"Meet me in the Morning\\" from Blood on the Tracks.  One difference  - its 4 times as long and 1/2 as good.  If you loved Blood on the Tracks, Desire, Highway 61...etc. this album is half as good. I love Dylan and am glad to own it.  Buy 20+ other albums that are better first.....  <br />
B00008NRLX|5.0|If your planing a long drive then do not go without this cd, because it will make a 4 hour drive seem like 1 hour, it could be one of the best i listened to since the new Tears for Fears, the harmonys and pure pop/country songs are great, when you can go from Dylan to the Beatles to CSNY and from a steel guitar, to a lush sweet violin and back to a raw rifting guitar you have a great cd. Its been in my player for a whole week of daliy 1 1/2 hour drives.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Enjoyed immensely.  I'm of the \\"older\\" generation but had seen part of the program on PBS which caused me to purchase the DVD.  Both my children (in their 40's) saw the Eagles in concerts when they were in their teens and couldn't believe I hadn't even heard of them before.  Hopefully, that's just a result of a very bad memory.

B000AYEIZY|4.0|... than before. Cream was always one of those shizoid bands: studio efforts overdubbed, well produced psychedelia, live shows a tsunami of three soloists having a go at it simultaneously on an Anglo-blues catalogue. Here, for the first time I can remember hearing, they play more like a BAND. There is a locked in cohesion to this show that was never present before, as you can clearly hear when you compare this to the farewell show from '69. These three coined the cliche \\"supergroup\\" and were known for playing with a ferocity fueled by their competitive egos. Perhaps as age has slowed them all down and as time has taken its toll on them and their colleagues, the notion of working more in step with each other brings more significant rewards. <br />It certainly does to the material. Their take here on Willie Dixon, Booker T Jones, Skip James and T-Bone have all the swagger of the masters and less of the youthful unrestrained testosterone of the late 60's. \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" and \\"Spoonful\\" would make their authors proud. \\"Badge\\" suffers from Clapton having so thoroughly redefined it with his band that it seems nothing but perfunctory here. However, Baker's bizarre reading of \\"... Wart...\\" is so weird that it seems to have gained in its spooky evocation of something both Dickensian and psychedelic. In the case of each of the musicians, they are clearly listening to each other and playing better as a unit than you would ever have any right to expect. There is a supple pwer and subtlety to how integrated they are in each other's rhythms that is inspiring. Given the mediocrity of Clapton's BACK HOME,  this is a delightful return to form. He isn't the GOD that he was on Cream's first surfacing, but that was just another way of clotting the music from flowing. All the years have served each of them well. They have not just not missed a beat (still with me?), they're actually a much better band. <br />The DVD is spectacularly shot. It is the kind of rock film Martin Scorcese would shave his bushy eyebrows for. Miraculously, Baker has survived well. Bruce looks almost as old as Steve Howe, and Clapton is amazing. It is a joy to watch their technique as they play. This really was a brilliant coda that eclipses the original legend. There is much to celebrate on both CD and DVD here. Enjoy!
B000929AJQ|3.0|I am happy Trent Reznor has gotten rid of most of his teen anxiety and has taken more mature direction. <br /> <br />Lyrics wise, I mean. Sounds feel sometimes a bit outdated to me. <br /> <br />But there is truly great music on the CD and it will be worth of your time.
B00008WT5J|3.0|This was my first album from Ac/dc, so i have a little-bit of nostailgia for it. It really should not be called an \\"album\\" at all, it was a soundtrack to the Stephen King B-flick \\"Maximum Overdrive\\" staring Emillio Estaves. The movie was great and it goes alnong well with the sound of Ac/dc playing with it. <br />The song song selection is pretty good i guess, althoug i wish there was more from Bon Scott on this thing. I think if you need a good driving CD, this should be it, \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"Sink the Pink\\", \\"Chase the Ace\\", \\"FTATR\\", these are all great and you can't go wrong with Ac/dc. It gets three stars mainly because i think their are other albums albums which should be acquired by Ac/dc before this one, like say BIB or \\"Powerage\\". <br /> <br />\\"Who Made Who\\" is a kick @$$ song, it was the first Ac/dc song i ever heard and i'v been listening to them ever since.
B000002LMM|5.0|This is The Sound Track ever.  <br /> <br />Sad, melancholic, beautiful, dark, fragile, gentle. <br /> <br />Turn your lights off and sit in the dark with a nice drink and think. <br /> <br />Wait till the trumpets come... <br /> <br />It is probably good idea not to hold your drink in your hands while listening. <br /> <br />This music brings you to another world. <br /> <br />Simply outstanding.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This album is is a MASTERPIECE. There is no need to talk about it, it has already been done and and it would be pointless to discuss it further. Despite what the moron said below,  Slayer is one of the most talented bands ever formed, i would sure like to see Scott \\"Classical Fan\\" try and play some of these \\"cr@p\\" songs on guitar or drums and see how well he fares. <br />Who can resist songs w/ titles like \\"Angle of Death\\", \\"Alter of Sacrafice\\" or \\"Criminally Insane\\"? <br />I have listened to this thing so many times that i can remember almost every note and all of the lyrics to it, no CD has ever made me do that! <br /> <br />Mr Scott \\"Classical Fan\\" is a big fan of Kansas, no wonder he is offened by R.I.B., so what he says is completely irrelevent and just downright foolish. He thinks a 3rd rate band like Armored Saint is better then Slayer is, that should be a dead give away right there. He thinks Slayer is so evil and offensive, yet he listens to Black Sabbath, who were the first band generally accosiated with the Devil, and Judas Preist, who had a song that caused a kid to put a shotgun to his head and pull the trigger. <br /> <br />Can you smell contradiction?
B00004TA41|4.0|Since I'm a big fan of John Coltrane's work, I found this piece, done in 1967 to be an example of his mind. <br />I fully enjoyed it, and have added it to my collection of his music.
0793518326|5.0|This book is a treasury for any Beatles fan. Every song they ever recorded is lovingly transcribed in equisite detail. For me, the correct high-fret fingering of the chiming opening chords of \\"Eight Days a Week\\" was worth the price of the book by itself - \\"easy guitar\\" books and lesser transcriptions give the common versions of the same chords down the neck, which misses the whole point. Sure, the print is on the small side, and the book is too thick to put on a music stand, but that's what copy machines are for...

B000AU9UYM|5.0|Jameson L. Thottam Review of Batman begins <br /> <br />I, Jameson L. Thottam, found that Batman Begins is a return to glory for a franchise that was once thought to be sunk by Mr. Ocean and Joel S. Gone are the flashy colors that prevailed in the last 2 installments, and gone are the tongue in-cheek sexual references that try to make the characters more than they need to be. Instead, Batman is reinvented in this film, by the steady hand of Director Christopher Nolan.  <br /> <br />Those, like me (Jameson L. Thottam) who have seen his films Insomnia and Momento, know that this is a man who can see the dark side of things, and boy does he take this film down a dark road. Relying more on the psyche, and less on flashy effects, Nolan has taken Batman back to its roots, and improved upon the story ten-fold. What had been a disgrace to comic book fans in previous films, Batman is given a new style, a new outlook, and a new car.  <br /> <br />Batman Begins of course centers around the main character of Bruce Wayne. Having seen his parents killed right in front of him, he has filled his heart with not only doubt, but with many fears as well. Hoping to find a solution to these fears he basically gives up on what once was a bright future, and turned instead towards discovering why criminals do the things that they do. This has led him on a journey that places him somewhere between lunatic and savior. He cannot even deal with the pain that he has inside, so he doesn't really see how he can fit back into society. This leads him right to the door-step of Ra's Al Ghul, who plans to teach him how to harness all of his fear and anger, and take vengeance upon all those who have taken the wrong path in life. Wayne goes through this training, only to finally fully discover what he really should be fighting for, and that he does have a purpose after all.  <br /> <br />Christian Bale dons the cape and cowl in Batman Begins, and I, Jameson L. Thottam, felt did a great job in the role. His brooding is just as good as Keaton's was, and he far surpasses what Kilmer and Clooney were able to do. Bale stands on his own, and really makes the character of Batman his own, by not falling prey to all of the stereotypes that the former actors had fallen under. This wasn't a lesson in showing off just how good looking Bale could be, and Bale does a great job of being part of the story, rather than being the story. To explain better, the movie was more about a man's struggles with his own demons, and less about kicking butt. Don't get me wrong, Bale has his scenes where he is able to show off everything he has learned, but at the meat of the movie we are able to cling to something more than just a few spectacular fight scenes.  <br /> <br />Surrounding Bale in this film, are many other great actors who lend their acting talents in great fashion. Gone are the over-the-top supporting characters who are designed more for star appeal than what they really offer the film, and they are replaced with accomplished actors who know just how to turn a phrase or create drama within a scene. Included in those actors is Liam Neeson as Ducard who takes Wayne to Al Ghul and begins his training, Gary Oldman who plays Detective Jim Gordon, Michael Caine who plays the Wayne's butler Alfred, and Morgan Freeman Lucius Fox, an expert working for the Wayne Company. They are all given parts that play to their talents, and it is very enjoyable to see any one of them on the screen at any given time. In addition, we have smaller roles played by Ken Watanabe and Rutger Hauer who are also fun to watch.  <br /> <br />Playing the female lead is Katie Holmes in a role that very well could push her over into starring roles in film. Being a supporting character has been her bread and butter since Dawson's Creek, and this film might be the one she needed. She is pretty good in her role, and does end up being the Mary Jane to Bale's Peter Parker. In my mind, Jameson L. Thottam's, she was decent,but she is no Kim Basinger. The final character we have in the film is Dr. Jonathan Crane who seems to have something to hide from the beginning of the film, and we are soon shown his true colors, and who the people that he deals with are. Crane was very good in this role, and seeing the film will provide the explanation as to why I don't over-indulge my assessment of his part. All in all, the cast of Batman Begins was a great one, and I, Jameson L. Thottam, was really glad with all of the choices made for the film.  <br /> <br />Batman Begins could have been one of those films that went too far over the top, or tried to re-hash old ideas that either had been done better, or just plain didn't work. Instead, what we have here is a homage to the comic book, and a true story that goes back to the roots of Batman. Don't expect it to be like the TV show, and don't expect it to be as light-hearted as the past few films. What we have here is a really dark film, which explains the transformation of a boy into a man, and everything that he hoped to accomplish. After the last movie, the franchise really needed a jump-start, and by going back to the beginning, rather than trying to build off Clooney's failure was the right way to go. I, Jameson L. Thottam, found myself almost applauding at the end of the film, and when there were emotional scenes involving the young Bruce Wayne I, Jameson L. Thottam, could really feel those emotions. Great acting, great story-telling, and the perfect cast helped to make this one of the best movies of 2005 so far. I, Jameson L. Thottam, cannot wait till the next Batman film comes out.  <br /> <br />Hope you can't either, <br /> <br />Jameson L. Thottam

0446677450|4.0|Jameson Thottam book review of Rich Dad, Poor Dad <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Study hard and stay in school. Get good grades and earn a college degree. Find a good company to work for, with excellent benefits, and you will be set for life\\" <br /> <br />How many of us have been given that same advice? I, Jameson L. Thottam, would bet that most all of us have heard this from our parents, from leaders, and from those whose opinions we trust. It sounds like the answer to everyone's problems, but according to author Robert Kiyosaki, this type of thinking is outdated and dangerous. <br /> <br />Key Points of this Book from Jameson L. Thottam: <br /> <br />Kiyosaki is a successful investor who is now retired and financially independent. He wrote this book based on his experiences growing up with his \\"poor\\" (biological) dad, a man who had a PhD and yet still struggled financially throughout his lifetime; and his \\"rich\\" dad (actually, the father of one of his friends), a man who never finished the eighth grade, yet went on to be financially independent and successful. Kiyosaki refers to his \\"rich\\" dad and his \\"poor\\" dad throughout the book, pointing out how conventional wisdom does not always lead to the financial success that we expect. <br /> <br />Kids and adults, like myself-Jameson L. Thottam, alike are taught many things in school, but financial knowledge isn't one of them. Knowing about money, financial markets, and investing is crucial to the success of an individual.  <br /> <br />Several lessons I, Jameson L. Thottam, found are emphasized in this book: <br />1. Rich people don't work for money, they let money work for them. <br />2. An individual needs to build a portfolio of cash- flow producing assets and avoid excessive liabilities. <br />3. You must be willing to take risks to be successful. And if there is a failure or setback along the way (and there will be many), an individual must be prepared to bounce back and try again. <br />4. You need to become financially literate. Take courses, read books, attend seminars, and do anything else you can think of to increase your knowledge of money. <br />5. Simply becoming educated and earning degrees does not guarantee your success! It only means that you will be employed by someone else and stuck in the rat race. <br /> <br />Once you have learned to make money work for you (like I, Jameson L. Thottam did), the cash flow that results will lead to prosperity and financial independence. Kiyosaki feels that people must change their attitudes and prepare their children for the information age that we currently live in, not the industrial age, which is in the past. <br /> <br />What's Wrong With This Book?: <br /> <br />I, Jameson L. Thottam, found this is a pretty good book, but it's a little too shallow. For example, Kiyosaki emphasizes over and over again the importance of building a portfolio of income producing assets, but he doesn't really explain how this can be done with a limited amount of money. He says that it's easier than many people think, but he never says exactly what to do. I don't know if he assumes that the reader already knows what to do, or if he covers these answers in his successive books (which I, Jameson L. Thottam, have not yet read). It would be helpful if he gave a little bit of step by step advice on exactly how to achieve some of these financial goals, with the limited funds that most people have to work with. <br /> <br />Closing Thoughts from Jameson L. Thottam: <br /> <br />\\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" is a good book, but it's not complete. More information needs to be given, demonstrating exactly how to get from point \\"A\\" to point \\"B\\". Since I have a background in finance, I, Jameson L. Thottam, found this book to be a little on the elementary side. It does include some sound advice, but it's mainly geared for the financial novice who is looking to get his/her feet wet for the first time. I, Jameson L. Thottam, didn't find anything particularly outstanding aboutthis book, but it's good enough to recommend to most people. It's about 200 pages in length and sells for about $15 in paperback. It did reach #1 on the New York Times Bestseller List, so it's obviously helping someone. <br /> <br />Jameson L. Thottam
B000053VAZ|5.0|Depp's performance is sheer genius in this film, and only part of the unfolding career of this giant of an actor.  Everyone else is terrific as well. Aiden Quinn has never been better in anything I've seen than he is here.  There isn't a false note in the entire film, and when it is finished you realize you've been invited to understand in a fresh and beautiful way what it means to love and to serve others, and how the desire to do this can infuse life with joy.  The film is proof that an exciting, well paced and gripping story can be made about the core values we share and our struggles -- without that story having to involve violence or darkness that can jar and upset younger viewers or any sensitive viewer for that matter.  A small masterpiece. --  When darkness comes, when stress is all around, take out the DVD of this film and watch it.  It will help you return to a place of optimism and faith in life and faith in others -- and faith in the making of good films.
B000002MP2|5.0|I see the cynical 1990s producing a \\"Generation X Holy Trinity\\" of angst-ridden rock. These three albums include Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" Nine Inch Nails \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" and Green Day's \\"Dookie.\\" These albums are the voice of teen and post-teen frustration.<br /><br />While \\"Nevermind\\" was lyrically abstract and \\"The Downward Spiral\\" was more direct-both albums depicted themes of desperation and chaos. In contrast, although quite cynical, \\"Dookie\\" is a far more upbeat album. \\"Dookie\\" shares themes similar with the other two albums; nihilism, lethargy, entrapment, and hopelessness, but it has one thing that the other two albums lack-a sense of humor.  The songs are mostly tongue-in-cheek. The same message is conveyed, but in a far more juvenile, albeit sincere tone.<br /><br />Although \\"Dookie\\" was the band's breakthrough smash, it was actually the bands third album, following \\"1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\\" (1990, 1991) (a combined album and EP) and \\"Kurplunk\\" (1992). By the release of \\"Dookie,\\" the band had perfected its pop/punk formula. Although it didn't start with Green Day, they brought popish assessable punk to the mainstream. Many other bands throughout the 90s/00s used/use \\"Dookie\\" as a blueprint for their inspiration.<br /><br />Although singer/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong's songs are straight-forward and simple, they are extremely infectious. These songs have an intense vitality, but are also highly melodic. Virtually every song on \\"Dookie\\" could have been released as a single. Although the songs sound similar, the album never gets redundant, because the album is well-paced with a good mix of fast and mid-tempo compositions. Drummer Tre Cool and Bassist Mike Dirnt provide an ample and stellar rhythm section.<br /><br />Released in 1994, this album has stood the test of time and has aged well. Whether it is 1994 or 2005, if you're in your late teens or 20s, just out of high school or college, and don't know what to do with your life, you can really relate to these songs. It is no small wonder why \\"Dookie\\" has sold over eight million copies.<br /><br />Compared to \\"Nevermind\\" or \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" \\"Dookie\\" may not be as complex or brilliant, but it's still a classic album that conveys many of the same themes. Although imitated by lesser bands (Good Charlotte, Sum 41), Green Day is the definitive pop-punk band of the 1990s and beyond.<br /><br /> \\"Dookie\\" is an essential album to own for any modern rock collection.gs.

006054094X|3.0|I am of two minds about this book by Gavin Menzies.  I find it absolutely fascinating to read some of the speculations and interpretations that he puts on different maps and findings.  I find it credible to believe that Chinese fleets of the early 1400s would be trading in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean, making regular journeys to places as far as Africa, and perhaps reaching the Pacific Coasts of North and South America a few times.<br /><br />However, I don't know what to think of such issues as Puerto Rico not only having been discovered by Chinese Fleets, but that based on this information, the Portuguese would have colonised areas in the Caribbean a generation prior to Columbus' journey - there seems no credible reason why Prince Henry the Navigator, being given such acclaim in history as he has been, would not also be credited with discovery of the New World if in fact he and his companions had found a passage across the Atlantic and discovered islands there.<br /><br />Menzies is a good writer.  I enjoyed reading the text very much.  His description of the history of imperial China in the generation of the 1421 fleet is very engaging.  The description of the politics and culture of China of the early Ming dynasty is good.  The building of the Forbidden City, the repair of the Great Wall, and the dredging and expansion of the Great Canal are all projects from this period.  It is also well known in historical circles that the period from 1400 to the 1430s was a time of exploration, with Zheng He, a Muslim eunuch in the court of the emperor, in charge of seven different fleets that reached Africa, Japan, and many islands of the South Pacific.  These were documented and maintained as part of the ongoing record of Chinese history - why they would be selective to edit out the parts about the Americas, Greenland, and Antarctica becomes a bit speculative.<br /><br />Likewise, his description of medieval Europe in the generations before and of the great voyages of discovery is also very interesting.  He describes some of the political forces driving both exploration and colonisation - again, however, things fall a bit short.  Why would the Portuguese, already settled in the Caribbean, agree to a division of the world by the Pope that would cut them out of that territory (particularly when the fact that they had a presence in Brazil was part of why they were permitted in the division to maintain their colonies there)?<br /><br />Menzie's evidence comes from maps, from archaeological finds, and from literary and documentary pieces.  However, one of the pitfalls here is that most every piece of evidence presented is subject to multiple interpretations.  Menzie's claims as a navigator and expert in chart-reading do bear up under scrutiny, but this does mean that his interpretations are necessarily correct.  There are those who brand his interpretations and conclusions as outlandish - I would opt more for the word 'hopeful' here, in that he does believe that what he has discovered is true on the whole, and this hopefulness leads in a particular hermeneutical direction.<br /><br />Accoring to one commentator, 'Menzies' hypothesis and his theory accomplishes what many Zheng He scholars and academicians failed to do: that is to create a wide awareness on the subject matter; and forced a critical rethink, including some reevaluations on the extent, the success and the failures of the Ming Imperial Treasure Fleet.'  The real benefit of a book such as this one is that it causes conversation and research into history among those who might not otherwise be so inclined.  The worrisome part is that it might not be conducted in such as way as to be able to separate fact from fiction.<br /><br />Menzies does maintain a website dedicated to further researches and refinements in his theory.  Thus far, few major academics and historians have signed on as believers of this theory, but there are some - Sir John Elliott, in the Department of Modern History at Oxford is perhaps the most notable.<br /><br />So, one is left at this - history is not an exact science much of the time, but it isn't a complete fiction or completely subjective dependent upon the whims of those who believe what they will believe, either.  It is true that China was more advanced that Europe in many ways at this time, and that the Chinese did command larger fleets than the Europeans at this point in time.  However, Menzies' conclusions here are based on interpretation that rests on the shifting sands of myth, legend, and documents with variable ideas of accuracy.  Menzies is passionate in his writing, but so far has failed to be convincing.  I will strive to maintain an open mind; I will continue to accept the more 'canonical' reading of history that has a stronger pedigree, but will follow the developments of Menzies' theory in the coming decades with interest.<br /><br />I would give this three-and-one-half stars given the option.epartment of Modern History at Oxford is perhaps the most notable.   <br /> <br />So, one is left at this - history is not an exact science much of the time, but it isn't a complete fiction or completely subjective dependent upon the whims of those who believe what they will believe, either.

B0002IVN9W|4.0|Bought this album after reading a glowing review in the local paper ... what a find!    At the moment, I am repeat playing about 30 songs that really hit the spot ... some from Muse, The Mars Volta, Radiohead, Bleu and 3 songs from this album. The Arcade Fire are right up there.    Makes me wish I could play guitar, sing and jive dance ... all at the same time. Favourites are Power Out, Rebellion, Wake Up. If the drum tempo on Tunnels didn't go awry during the first minute this would have earned the exalted 5 stars ... it's that close to perfect for me!
B000929AJQ|5.0|I have to admit I wasn't a fan of NIN until last week, although I did like Reznor's bigger hits like \\"Closer\\" and \\"Hurt.\\" A friend invited me to go with her to a concert, and I reluctantly agreed. I was blown away and moved enough to buy both \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"With Teeth.\\"<br /><br />They're both different albums, and initially I didn't think \\"With Teeth\\" was that appealing, mostly because I was drawn to Spiral's industrial sound. After a few test drives, however, I have to say I love the latest record more. With the exception of the title track (\\"A-with-a Teeth-a\\" sounds rather silly when he says it, but give me time, I might like it later), this album has a multitude of catchy songs that will appeal to a variety of tastes.<br /><br />My favorite songs are the first single (\\"The Hand That Bleeds\\"), \\"Don't You Know What You Are,\\" \\"All The Love In The World,\\" \\"Love Is Not Enough,\\" \\"Only,\\" and \\"Right Where It Belongs.\\" Considering that's half the record, I'd say it was well worth the cash.<br /><br />I think what I appreciate the most about \\"With Teeth\\" is the artist's willingness to approach the doubts over own self-worth. In \\"Spiral\\" I sensed self-loathing and helplessness, which I would have identified with as an awkward teenager. However, in his latest it becomes apparent that Reznor is working towards a more balanced outlook on life. He's examining whether or not he's still relevant in the music world, and what can really make him happy. The guy's 40 years old--if he was still singing about how much he hated himself despite all of NIN's success, I would not be able to take him seriously!<br /><br />So give this album a chance. Listen to it a few times, review the lyrics and you'll realize how much you love it.
B0000047CW|5.0|this is the greatest Sunday morning records of all time.  So smooth.
B00005JMYI|5.0|I wasn't a fan of Will Ferrell until this movie. He is a laugh-producing machine in this film with his bad hair and hilarious co-workers. I never really saw it as a women's lib-type movie like many people I know did. It seemed like an innocent, traditional battle of the sexes..to me.  The cast works well together, especially Ferrell and Applegate. Their witty banter had me laughing (out loud, even) so much I couldn't hear half of their conversation. <br />I don't really understand the reason for the \\"Unrated\\" version. There's nothing in it, in my opinion, that is any worse than PG-13 material. Oh well, probably a marketing thing. I don't know the story. Well, I won't spoil the plot or anything like that. I won't even quote it. But for someone like me, who didn't like Will Ferrell until I watched \\"Anchorman,\\" to love it, I can only imagine the delight die-hard Ferrell fans have had with this one.
B000002UAO|2.0|This album was a rushed recording project and it shows.  During 1965 at the height of Beatlemania, the guys were rushed into the studio at the end of the year after a successful tour and hit film. They had absolutely no time to do any recording so basically everything was pulled from where the sun doesn't shine.  There are a few tracks that stand out such as \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" but all in all these songs might as well have been put on the Please Please Me album (which the song \\"Wait\\" was a song written during that time). The only really cool thing about this album is the effected photograph used as the front cover.  Other than that, I really don't see what is so pivitol about this album.
6305736650|5.0|Growing up, I always wanted to watch this movie I had heard so much about. It wasn't until six months ago that I finally saw it on TCM. It was marvelous. My eyes were deep inside the tv - I did not move until it ended. It quickly replaced other movies as my all-time favorite. I have since watched this masterpiece a few more times, as it grows deeper and more perfect with each viewing. <br />I was most impressed with Ingrid Bergman. I heard that she didn't think this was her best performance, but I fell for it. Her lines were said naturally and her tears were even believable. My favorite, though, would have to be Dooley Wilson..Sam. He always managed to be in the middle of everything, and played a funny yet complicated role. Ah, there's too much to write about the experience of Casablanca, and I wouldn't be one to ruin it for anybody. But as someone I know remarked, \\"My gosh, it has one famous quote after another.\\" To which I replied, \\"Here's looking at you, kid.\\" I was, of course, branded a permanent loser. But that's okay. Good day, all.
B000001F9E|5.0|I'd forgotten what a great album this was! <br /> <br />Truth to tell this was my brother's album - I was more into prog-rock (which this sort of qualifies for since it IS a concept album ;) ) and he was in the band so he needed it to learn the hits, but I'd always liked it back then. But time passes and I kept up with the prog rock types and the big name bands, but Thin Lizzy? not so much.  <br /> <br />Some of the lyrics actually did stick in my head - especially the Cowboy Song - with that insanely great twin-lead and the - well - suggestive lyrics in the break - but I hadn't really thought about it for 20ish years until a young friend of mine (she's younger than the album ;) ) mentioned it. <br /> <br />And I went - \\"Yeahhhhh!!\\" <br /> <br />So I bought it. <br /> <br />And - it's not a great remaster, but it it sounds like an album should sound, and the songs are GREAT! alot of variety in tempos and subject matter - the band just plain kicks BUTT and it's just - great! <br /> <br />So buy it! it's what - 10 bux? c'mon! Go for it, you will NOT regret it!
B00005JKCH|5.0|This was a surprisingly good movie. Superhero movies of late haven't been that great (The Hulk was an endless, rambling movie with no talent; the recent Batman movies have been nothing more than guano). And, to top it all off, I always thought Spider-Man was kind of a loser of a superhero..he is a spider, after all. But this movie changed that. <br />     <br />Peter Parker was a normal kid in love with a flirtatious redhead named Mary Jane (just like the comics - wow!). He gets bit by a spider, meets the Green Goblin (a.k.a. best friend's dad), saves the world, and kind of gets his girl. It's a typical superhero storyline, but was directed brilliantly. Much of the time focuses on his transformation from normal to freak, which is very amusing and worth watching. There are dozens of characters which you won't be forgetting anytime soon. But I guess that's the point.. If you're going to watch a comic book-turned movie  made in recent years, this is the one to watch. My friends and I have watched it several times and it never gets dull. That's all... \\"Uh oh, it's Spider-Man..\\"
B000AL730Y|5.0|Ok, I admit it. At first I heard it I put it aside thinking \\"This is horrible..\\" But then I saw him live last week, twice, then I loaded up the CD onto the trusty iPod. I really actually listened to it, and now I love it. I think it's one of his best. I love the production, I think it's a great side of Paul that we are seeing.
B00005JNX0|4.0|This movie is actually pretty funny. Not as good as The Incredibles or the Shrek movies, but much better than movies like Ice Age. The four main characters are reasonably funny, and the zebra and lion get the funniest lines. It's interesting to see David Schwimmer as a giraffe, but his character gets kind of annoying..sort of like Ross. <br /> <br />Any time the penguins are on screen, it's hilarious. From their plot to escape until the end of the movie, they had the theater roaring with something that sounded like laughter. The moment when they finally arrive in Antarctica had me rolling on the floor with tears coming from my eyes.  And the plot...well, a bunch of animals escape from a zoo, go back to the zoo, and by a series of animated miracles, wind up in Madagascar. Yeah. It's believable. But it works. <br /> <br />But most importantly, it's for kids and adults alike. There's not really anything that would offend young 'uns, and it's not so cute that it makes grown-ups squirm, either. It has dozens of cultural references (old ones, too) that are fun to look for. The lion's version of the last scene of Planet of the Apes was so random and hilarious, and it's moments like these that make it worth watching.
1577314808|5.0|I found Mr. Tolle's book so helpful.  He is so right about the fact that we live for the past or the future, but rarely live for NOW.  I know, we've been told that it's not a good quality to live only for the present, that we must plan for the future, but the stress that we feel is usually over something we are worrying about that may never happen, or some trauma we've experienced in the past.  Let go of it.  I keep this book by my bed and read a little in it every night.  It has helped me make changes in my life that allow me to disentangle myself from situations which are just making me more unhappy.
B0000062FL|2.0|This dosn't have Rob Thomas on it and in fact it dosn't even sound like Santara to me. I borrowed it from my uncle because he likes Santana. I said is this the one with Rob Thomas and he said yeah, but he's always fulling around with us. This is mostly just some guy playing an organ and of course the mighty Carlos on guitar, but nothing you would hear on the radio, unless you like the oldy's station. What CD has \\"Forget aabout it\\"? <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Need to chime in here a few years late (but thankfully not TOO late) on this FireFly thing everyone's been talking about.  Originally I wasn't the least bit interested in this series because: <br /> <br />  a.) I never watched Buffy, and although I'm sure it must be good since so many people LOVE it, every episode I ever saw of it seemed pretty campy to me (plus I was too far \\"behind\\" to want to go through the effort of getting into it).  I decided that this Joss Whedon guy, fan following though he may have, wasn't my cup of tea. <br /> <br />  b.) I'm not a big \\"series\\" watcher - not on TV anyways - so it's a MAJOR thing for me to pick up & get addicted to a show <br /> <br />  c.) the series was cancelled before too long, so - ha ha - \\"TV-watching preference\\" victory was mine!  Whew - glad I didn't give THAT show a day in court! <br /> <br />So anyways, fast forward to a couple of months ago: because of the postive word of mouth I'd been hearing about the new movie \\"Serenity\\" I decided maybe I'd check out the show it was based on. <br /> <br />So then I went online and read some Amazon.com user reviews about the Firefly series, and that made it really seem like I was missing out on this big thing.  So I Netflix'ed the first disc, watched the 2-hour pilot, and... <br /> <br />I WAS HOOKED!!! <br /> <br />Instantly bought the 4-disc series, and now it's the new great love in my (and several other people who I've told about it) life! <br /> <br />Of course, now I feel the buffoon, here writing a review of this thing that so many people have been in love with for eons now, but I feel I must.  What a fantastically-written show!  Even in just the 2-hour pilot they do a great job of introducing everybody and not making anyone \\"all figured out\\" right away.  Everyone had their own little hidden complexity that made you want more - Jayne was probably the worst in this regard since he was playing the big tough dumb guy, but even he turned out better than I'd hoped (just talking about the pilot here - I grew to love Jayne like everyone else in later episodes). <br /> <br />Malcolm Reynolds (the captain of the ship) is my favourite.  Luke Skywalker and Han Solo and Jean Luc Picard and J.T. Kirk all rolled into one, plus a mean streak.  I was hooked on the series by the end of the pilot, in large part because of Mal. <br /> <br />I think it's a testament to the writing and the acting that ALL of the characters are so great.  It would've been easy to screw up on the \\"secondary characters\\", but every single one of them is superb.  Everyone gets their moment in the limelight sooner or later. <br /> <br />The setting... sci-fi western that somehow WORKS PERFECTLY.  I feel like this is a show that was made for me - sci-fi cowboy pirates with a noble streak.  Genius, I say. <br /> <br />While every episode has been better than the last, one standout episode that I particularly loved was \\"Out of Gas\\" (the one with all the \\"origins\\"-type flashbacks in it).  I also really like how theres such continuity between the episodes.  In Star Trek: TNG I never liked how something that happened last week was forgotten about the next show (more often than not), but in Firefly all the people and places you run into you see again later on.  Very rewarding for the viewer. <br /> <br />If you want to see the movie, I high reccommend watching the series first.  As good as the film is \\"stand alone\\", the \\"payoff\\" of being that much more emotionally invested in all the characters is MUCH sweeter if you've watched the series first.
B00006690G|4.0|Overall, this is a great cd with loads of ace music, although the \\"good\\" tracks are mostly the ones which grow on you (\\"Sing for the Moment\\" gets annoying after a while).  <br />Eminem really does have a way with words when he bothers- check out the anti-Bush lyrics on square dance; \\"All this terror America demands action, next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin' <br />To join the Army or what you'll do for they Navy  <br />You just a baby, gettin' recruited at eighteen <br />You're on a plane now, eatin' their food and their baked beans  <br />I'm twenty-eight, they gonna take you 'fore they take me!\\" -this on a song which he claims is designed to help people relax and have a good time! A hint that he was into politics before \\"Mosh\\"?
B0006SSOHC|4.0|This is definately one of those movies you'll have to watch a few times to fully understand what exactly is going on.  This movie wastes no time as it opens with \\"Adam\\" and \\"Larry\\" chained to pipes in a long forgotten bathroom.  This movie will take you on a ride and leaves a great opening for a sequel I am very exciting about seeing.  If you are a fan or Horror movies, then this is for you.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Seriously, this movie was much better than expected. I've heard nothing but bad things and negative remarks for this instalment in the Star Trek motion picture series, and thus I had to find out for myself if all this hatred was truly justified. <br /> <br />The one time I caught The Final Frontier was when I was a wee lad, so my memories of it are practically non-existent. Watching it on this 2-disc DVD edition, I found myself intrigues by the opening sequence featuring Sybok, and the Mount Rushmore sequence between Kirk, Spock, and Bones was totally charming and wonderful. <br /> <br />The idea behind the story is good - the crew of the Enterprise meeting God, although execution is flawed and the FX is awful. But these are flaws from a technical standpoint, and though one might want to blame director William Shatner for it, history has proved that there were many things that affected the production that was beyond his control. <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed The Final Frontier. It's definitely not the best in the series, but is hardly the worst (that distinction still falls on The Motion Picture, IMHO). It's a very flawed movie, but this DVD is well worth the money if only to see more of the behind the scenes story behind The Final Frontier.
B000002UB3|4.0|This album has alot of awesome songs on it, i love  maxwell's silver hammer though some people dont, I didnt live during the beatles AT ALL , but i was raised on them  from the time i was born in 88'  This IS NOT they're best album  nor is sgt. pepper  any real fan of the beatles know that  they're best  album by far was  \\"the white album\\"  but this record def. is a great way to say goodbye to the beatles. and is def. in the top 3 or 4  of all their albums.  let it be  was the last release but  is one of the least enjoyable records.  \\"let it be\\" was a good song and thats it.  so Yeah  def. get \\"abbey road\\" and if you dont have it  pick up \\"the white album\\"
B00000099Y|5.0|This CD was undoubtedly the best one Tool had. I liked nearly every track on this CD and three of the songs on this disc were played regularly on radio stations during its release.While undertow really only gave us sober as a great tune,Aenima offered about 8 quality songs (I thought).Tool has not been able to duplicate it success since.If you enjoy tools style also check out Perfect Circle.The first album by them is a great one also but takes a few listen throughs to adjust to the more mellow style (well with most songs).
0312958455|5.0|This is the fourth Harry Bosch book that I've read and it is by far the most personal.  This time, Detective Bosch investigates the one crime that drove him to join the police force: the unsolved murder, in 1961, of his own mother.<br /><br />As the book opens, Bosch has been suspended for attacking his supervisor, Lieutenant Harvey Pounds (who has made appearances in previous Bosch novels) and is required to attend counseling sessions with police psychologist Carmen Hinojos.  Although initially reluctant to bare his feelings, Bosch starts probing the childhood wounds he suffered as the fatherless son of a prostitute, who was forced to spend the bulk of his childhood in McLaren Hall. Despite his ongoing therapy, Bosch engages in a series of self-destructive actions which nearly torpedo his career. As Bosch grapples with painful memories, he methodically solves the case -- and other, related murders, including that of his mother's pimp, Johnny Fox.  In the process, Bosch uncovers early-1960s corruption and comes face to face with detectives, prosecutors and criminals of that era.<br /><br />Once again, Connelly does not disappoint.  The story is well-crafted, with a surprise ending that is unexpected, but makes sense.  As always, the description of Los Angeles -- now and then -- is spot on.  Another fine page-turner!
B0009HLDFU|1.0|HOW can ANYONE give this crappy album 5 stars? i loved the foo fighters' previous albums but this is just plain bad. well, maybe i am being a  bit harsh, 'in your honour' is kinda ok, but none of the songs are memorable. None of them match up to the heart-stopping classics like 'everlong' and 'hey johny park' (i think thats what its called). i was so excited when it came out and i went and bought the special edition with the dvd. i was really disappointed.  <br /> <br />and then i found out that it had copy protection. i hate when bands get too big for their boots and start doing this, and also, selling concert tickets at, like, 25 (which foo fighters have done here in england). i know that people say that you should 'support the band' and everything, but what harm is it to copy a cd for a couple of friends (especially is the cd is crap like this one, cos i wouldn want them to wste their money like i did). its not like im running a big pirating business. and i should also have the right to choose where and when i listen to the music that I HAVE BOUGHT with my own hard-saved money. cant bands be content with the fame and adoration from their fans? do they have to raise the prices of everything? its actually unbelievable what they are charging for gig tickets! i can affort to pay twenty-something or even thirty something pounds every tima i wanna go to a gig (not that i would go to a foo fighters gig after this. or maybe i would, cos they would play some of the classics).  <br /> <br />anyway, back to 'in your honour'. there are a couple of songs on the acoustic cd that are quite good, but otherwise, its not worth it so dont buy it.
B00000705Z|4.0|Again the Pet Shop Boys played their little trick on their fans.

B0009IW88A|5.0|Too many people have tried to compare both the movie, Batman Begins, and its soundtrack to previous efforts.  The problem is that Nolan's Batman is so much more real than those of the past.  And that's probably the best way to describe Zimmer and Howard's score.  It's not overdone.  It isn't cheap or childish.  It doesn't feel like fantasy.  The essence of the music tells the story of flesh and blood, of a man who has been wounded and refuses to let that destroy him.  You can feel the desire to do good coupled with the pull towards an inner darkness in the throbbing strings throughout the score.  It perfectly carries the dark mood of a mind possessed with the conflict between justice and revenge.  From the first moments, where a rhythmic thumping like great bat wings hovers on the periphery, to the repeating chant-like fanfare rising near the end, it speaks of darkness and loss.  This is music for black, abandoned alleyways, for the deepest and most enigmatic wells of the psyche.  There a moments where it descends to almost disturbing levels and here the hallucinatory sound effects of the Scarecrow are well-placed.  Artibeus, particularly, communicates fear and confusion.  On the other side of the coin, the tender piano and cello moments in Eptesicus and Corynorhinus remind us that underneath the black suit, the Dark Knight is just a man who bleeds like everyone else.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|I find this to be one of Eric's most unique, soulful works of all time.  It is filled with the type of love songs that he admired George Harrison for, those simple, from the heart love songs about what's most important in his life. I'm a die-hard fan, so I had some trepidation too (as I've heard from others), but it's quite refreshing to hear this side of him, and the DVD side of the dualdisc gives you an idea about what he was thinking when he wrote the songs (I recommend you buy that version). Who wouldn't be happy for him?  I know I am. I find myself anxious to listen to this album again and again.
1400031354|5.0|Mma Ramotswe prepares to marry the most excellent gentleman, Mr J. L. B. Matekoni and continues to work her short detective problems in this charming second addition to the Number One Ladies Detective Agency series.  Tales of joy and triumph over suffering abound throughout this book.  I do highly recommend the reader enjoy the original Number One Ladies' book before this one, since it gives an excellent introduction to the characters and many references are made in this book to events in the first one.  I must warn you though, once you read one book in this series you will be hooked!

B00003CXBK|5.0|If you're wondering whether you should see this, ask yourself: <br /> <br />Do I like action/adventure films? <br /> <br />Do I like action/adventure films without meaningless violence? <br /> <br />Do I want to see a movie with a strong female character who is not the stereotype (stereotype as in sexy and dangerous, or less dangerously sexy, pure, but too weak and thus needs a male character)? <br /> <br />Do I want to see anime, but not kiddish anime? <br /> <br />Am I at least mildly interested in the conflict between human interests and the preservation of nature? <br /> <br />Do I question the validity of at least some war? <br /> <br />Can I appreciate artful animation? <br /> <br />Do I want to be able to accept anime as real movies and not silly cuteness? <br /> <br />If you answer yes to ANY of this... well, you might have guessed, I would strongly recommend seeing the movie. Of course, the subtitled version is better than the dubbed; the literal translation being even better than the \\"adjusted\\" one. <br /> <br />If you're new to anime, or have never seen an anime movie before, you must see this movie. You will be looking for other anime after this...
B000002MG1|5.0|This is the gold standard.  Haunting, melodic, uplifting - all the emotions are brought out when listening to this masterpiece. <br /> <br />
B0009YKWAK|2.0|A pedigree of Oscar winning actors and a director are sadly wasted in THE INTERPRETER.  I consider myself of above average intelligence and attention span, but the convoluted script for this movie takes so many turns and the pace is so slow that it is hard to become truly involved in the outcome.  Nicole Kidman gives a glowing performance as always as a UN interpreter who overhears the assassination plot for a visiting African dignitary.  Sean Penn is the SS agent haunted by the recent death of his estranged wife, and the agent who handles Kidman's accusations.  Catherine Keenar is wasted as Penn's partner, a cardboard character whose presence is nominal to say the least.  Director Sydney Pollack turns up in a cameo as Penn's hardnosed boss, but his direction is certainly not Oscar caliber.  I'm not sure what the scriptwriter's intentions were for this movie, but as a thriller it misses the mark and as a character study, it barely sustains interest, in spite of the noteworthy performances.  A shame to see such talent squandered.
B0002VEX7S|5.0|I listen to mainly hard rock like System of A Down, AFI, Linkin Park, Godsmack and even some rap.  You know, music that's raw, that's human and we can identify with. <br /> <br />But this music is other worldly. <br /> <br />There's such an inexplicable passion and beauty about her music that cuts to the core of your soul.  It's ethereal, poignant, spiritual and almost divine.  <br />   The whole album just fills your soul with longing to connect to that which is mysterious, mystical, beautiful and which is greater.  To experience true love, adventure and a passion for life.  Truly inspiring.  To list a few: <br />   Song 6 \\"La Serenissima\\" is all instrumental but still brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it. (and I've had this for almost 7 years) It is one of my favorite songs of all time.  <br />   \\"Dante's Prayer\\" is also a very moving song about connecting with the Divine.   <br />   \\"Highwayman\\" is a sad tale of romance. <br />   \\"Mummer's Dance\\" mysterious yet somewhat festive song about an ancient society.  Full of wonder. <br />   \\"Skellig\\" another beautiful, mysterious song. <br /> <br />This is not feel good, new agey, Enya-type sleepy music.  This is deep, spiritual and heavy.  It's a journey. <br /> <br />How long, Loreena, must we mere mortals wait until you release a new album!?
6305897786|5.0|Saw in theater and liked it.  This one improves with more watches and now it's one of my favorites.  Mr. Depp is outstanding as always.  The DVD quality is excellent and the soundtrack, WOW.  It's a dialogue driven move, so PAY ATTENTION!
B000007T1M|5.0|Best SOAD album ever!!!! (Toxicity is a close second) <br /> <br />Raw, angry, poetic, lyrical and philosophical this album is full of thought and energy.  It really sticks in your head. <br />Forget \\"mezmerize\\" and \\"steal this album\\".  This is a masterpiece.  System at their finest.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|One of the few musical acts that give me goose bumps, bring tears to my eyes and make my heart swell. <br />Pure and honest audio heaven.  <br />Their music incredibly enhances the mood for love, life and imagination.  <br />If you're looking for alt-rock, gangsta-rap, reggeaton-dance, Top 40 corporate-pop, or death metal...keep looking.  <br />If you're tired of the holding patterns of the above music, and desire something absolutely incredible, stop looking.
B0002Z1EG2|3.0|This is the much anticipated Greatest Hits cd from Canadian Shania Twain. The Cd itself is okay, but I found a few things that bothered me. First, like \\"UP\\", I would've made a pop version and a country version of this cd. This cd has the pop versions of her songs and I would prefer her Country versions. Another thing that I didn't like was the songs picked, alot of them were great, but, I would've added Rock this Country and IMO Nah! but thats me. The new songs are nothing new really, Party for Two is just one of them everyday pop songs, I would've gotten a country singer with a little more background to do this single, like Brad Paisley or somebody. Don't! is a song that would get on anyone's nerves. I Ain't no Quitter is another up beat song thats actually decent.

0441009425|3.0|I found this book worth the read for the creative technology concepts; the author even ventured into explanations of how the future technology works (my favorite \\"definition\\" of Science Fiction).  Sadly, the storyline lacked plot development.  It was cohesive and mysterious.  But the plot wasn't very interesting; it just didn't pull me in.  Finally, a co-author with military-SF background could have really helped with the various \\"confrontations\\".
0140540563|5.0|If you you are looking for some light entertainment, this is a great read for kids and adults who are young at heart. Then, if you think about it, the book could be a really good way to help kids or adults think about the wolves who try to sell us baloney in politics and other arenas everyday. This wolf is a modern day con artist trying to twist the truth, and hide his true nat. After all, wasn't that the original intent of many myths and fairly tales? But if you don't want to go there, relax and enjoy this sarcastic, clever, and humorous retelling of a classic tale. Enjoy!
B000A0GP4K|2.0|It's hard to tell which is more confusing - this terribly unfocused rambling documentary or its insufferable subject. Bob Dylan has always struck me as nothing more than a very coy businessman. With a few exceptions (Tangled up in Blue, Shelter from the Storm), his music is quite feeble in terms of melodic composition, lyrics and actual performance. This documentary, like many of Dylan's sheep fans, confuses pretentiousness with profundity. I gave it two stars for the backround scenery in the old film footage.
0307276902|5.0|One reviewer said this is captivating to the pulse and emotions.  I agree, a bit scary to imagine, waking up on a plane and not know where you are (since I'm a frequent traveler), but still captivating.  However, I prefer something more captivating AND quickening to the pulse like Tie Me Up Tie Me Down, recently released, also Endless Pursuits, both of which are as creative and captivating, but a little more racey. <br />I will keep this on my shelf and re-read it, but only AFTER my plane has landed!! <br />Stace
0812550706|5.0|my mum read enders game loved it so she gave her copy to my brother he loved and lent it to me and suprise suprise i loved it.Card has a very unique style of writting that really does captivate the person reading it into a gritty world of where young genius children hold the key to the earths victory against an alien race called the buggers.Its a tale of a young genius child called andrew {nick name ender} who is the child destined to defeat the buggers.this book isn't a childrens book but a book that can be read young adults.most people who read this book will admire the incredible description that card puts into his work which really helps you imagine battle school and so on.But one of the greatest achievments card has sucseeded in was making a twist that really is quit hard to guess.this book i recommend as highly as i can to anyone.sheer brilliance!!!!!!!
B0009MAP9A|4.0|The reissues of Bob Dylan and The Times They Are A-Changin' are excellent releases on their own merits.  Still, I can't help but feel like both of these releases fall short of the phenomenal 2003 remasters of much of the Dylan catalog.  Those discs were Hybrid-SACDs, packaged in cardboard cases that replicated the original album jackets and artwork.  By contrast, these 2005 remasters are regular old CDs, and packaged in standard, generic jewel cases.  Curiously, the 2003 series was issued on the Sony/Legacy label, while the 2005 titles are released by Columbia.  This may account for the difference. <br /> <br />Of course, the music is as great as it always was, and the remasters are much better than the old CDs.  Still, it's troubling to see Sony taking a step back from the care that they had previously given to the Dylan catalog.  Here's hoping Sony gives the future remasters of albums like The Basement Tapes and  Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid the consideration they are due. <br />
B000050IE6|5.0|I originally bought this album as a freshman in highschool back in 2003 but i loaned it to a senior friend of mine and he ran off with it to a college down in Texas (bastard) and since i live in wisconsin that obviously causes a bit of a predicament. Anyways, occasionally i'll hear and see various customer reviews that give every song on an album 5 stars and then conclude with \\"GO RUN OUT AND BUY IT.\\" Strangely enough I just fell into that category. Between my favorite artist such as JAy-Z, Otep, Mos Def, Meshuggah, Kanye West, In flames, linkin park, marilyn manson, chimaira, korn, slipknot(second album only), mudvayne, various other \\"rappers\\" and metal tastes that can go on for years. Taproot, Emperor, Bloodbath, Tool, Scars of Tomorrow, Dead to Fall, Norma JEan, Atreyu, Unearth and that is enough. sorry about that rant. I just had to show the versatality to increase the meaning that i can say this is my favorite album ever. Everything i love about real music is in this album. It takes you on a roller coaster ride with brutal vocals with riffs and chords that carry the vocals perfectly, and when they have a gap between lyrics there is usually some genious riff that contains chords with perfect rhythm to keep you constantly intune with it. That does become a problem sometime when your loving the guitar sequence and then it switches into another one that you like equally as well but want to go back to the other at the same time. Now all of that was just the music alone. IT also happens to be a concept album, and i cannot begin to accuratly describe how they brung the story together. A man who was cast away comes back to take is beloved \\"Melinda\\" and flees, but all the while they are being chased down. I strongly encourage one who is buying this album to go look at a lyrics website that has the songs to this album. it'll show you what to expect. I'm trying to think of more to say, and i know im missing more to highlight this album but is impossible to state them all.This is a perfect album. Do yourself a favor and go endulge yourself in Still Life.
B000B5XOXY|5.0|When you consider the first two films under the direction of Goth hack who never read a comic in his life. The success of the films depended on the stars, not the film to draw an audience. Schumacher has some talent and the script actually carried a deeper story with wit and wry(plus Carrey's and Jones adlibs). Val and the gang deliver what I consider the best of the four. That's not saying much, but five stars for making me not leave the theater as I did with the other three. One small note, Nickelson's joker the exception to all this of coarse. Although, I will not forgive his dancing to one of Prince's worst songs.
B00005OWEG|5.0|My favorite film of all time, but when I watched it on my widescreen lcd it looked horrible! The top border had a flaw in the film and there is a black dot near the top for the first 10 mins of the movie. the quality is completely bush! Please others chime in on this. This is not a matter of opinion, this was the worst lookind DVD I have seen! I hope they are planning a deluxe version of the film..it's inevitable. The original looks better on DVD. Shocking!
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie is spectacular!It's a two disc DVD and I was just going to watch the 1st dvd and save the 2nd one for the next night, but I couldn't wait, so I ended up watching the whole thing in one sitting! The storyline is wonderful, and the acting, costumes, and scenery is great and breathtaking.Colin Firth is terrific in his role. Definitly a must see! I rented it at first, but ended up buying it.
0307276902|2.0|Can you imagine humans in a hundred years or so--and students \\"discovering\\" shameless confessional tomes like this --this--bloated morass of narcissistic rage and endless rants on: ME ME, ME and MY BAAAAAD PARENTS!!??\\"    \\"Oh, class, here we have a sample of what was known as the Rehab Memoir...now the question of the day is: would you rather deQuincy's Confessions of an Opium Eater or this from a James Frey?\\" or--  (I'll take deQuincy's classic!)    \\"Well...I think I'll major in 21st Century Rehab Lit \\" .     Ah., but where will you have the time to read these works? There's so many books like: \\"Dry\\", \\"Smashed: Story of a Drunken Girlhood \\" and shelves and shelves of many more like them.     Frey has gotten the waving of the wand from Lady O--and now he's laughing himself  into a tizzy--and--all the way to the plush offices of his financial advisors! He knows so well how he's duped millions into believing this yarn (mobster, \\"Leonard\\", and the females all over this hunka man...and the way everyone's in his thrall...or scared to death of his big bad bully-self!!)     Oh, come on. Are we that gullible? Are we?
0743454537|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It not only brought tears to my eyes and made me think of how healthy people don't realize how lucky they are. It also showed the trials and hardships of families in this or similar situations. I recommend this book to anyone who has a similar situation, or to anyone who is just interested in it.
B00006M183|5.0|Riot Act is the strongest Pearl Jam album to date.    Oh and to the grunge talkers.    GRUNGE IS A WORD, ITS NOT MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!    If you know anything about music you can quite clearly tell that  NIRVANA, PEARL JAM, ALICE IN CHAINS, SOUNDGARDEN sound nothing alike!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0790729970|5.0|\\"Mask\\" starts out simple enough as it should.  We see the mundane, boring life of a well-meaning yet socially challenged young junior bank employee.  His meager apartment, his nosy, irritating landlord, his nepotistic boss at work, his poor taste in clothes, etc.  His two consolations are his swinging buddy at work and his idealistic belief that there's somebody out there waiting for him.  Into this well-set stage comes a mask that our hero, Stanley Ipkiss, stumbles upon and holds up to his face.  Presto!  He suddenly changes into a devil-may-care, life of the party, green-skinned lover.  Off he goes to really enjoy life.   <br /> <br />The highlights of \\"Mask\\" are those scenes in which Ipkiss is transformed into this character.  We see the combined efforts of music, makeup, special effects, and the acting of Jim Carey that create a world of fun, humor and excitement.  Carey hams it up and we love it.  Along the way, an actual plot is woven into the picture.  It's a good enough plot but we want to see Ipkiss put on the mask again to see what new craziness we'll get.   <br /> <br />In the end, the mask has served its' purpose and Stanley Ipkiss is not a new man; he is the same person but no longer shy about who he is.  The doors have opened and his new life is beginning.  After the excitement of \\"Mask\\" wears off, after we've seen it a few more times, we realize that the meaning is that we are all repressed somewhat by our intimidation from our surroundings.  If we could just slip into some sort of costume or alias and be who we really want to be, life would be fulfilled.  The movie reminds us that, if this were possible, there would be a lot great stories but a lot of bad stories as well.  Good expands to better while bad expands to worse.  It's who we are in the first place that determines where the mask will let us go to.  Ultimately, we discover, we don't have to be the life of the party; we just need to accept the invitation and attend it.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Once again Neil Young has wriiten a beautiful story through his music.  An added bonus is watching him on the DVD.  Gotta love the harmonica, and the musical arrangement overall takes my breath away.  This Old Guitar is so pretty...kinda reminds me of 'Without Rings\\" from Silver and Gold...I am looking froward to Mr. Demme's interpretation.
B000050FEN|5.0|This was one of the first DVDs I ever purchased and continue to be impressed by both the film and the extra content presented in this edition. Director David Fincher shows that he is truly one of the best film makers around by the way he handles the material. No shot is pointless nor is any of the dialogue throwaway.  <br /> <br />The characters and plot all begin as if this is a run-of-the mill cliched cop-movie but the film soon evolves into something quite different. Sinister and unexpected this movie had me hooked as the two cops investigate a string of brutal murders.  <br /> <br />I found the film enjoyable but not light-hearted. For fans of these types of movies this is easily one of the best. I would not recommend this to people who don't like profanity or violence. Even though most of the violence in this movie is implied rather than explicit it can still be hard to stomach for some viewers.  <br /> <br />All in all a great plot, good acting, masterfully directed and very engrossing. The movie also brings out some interesting themes on morality, apathy and life in general without preaching to its audience. One of my favourite films of all time.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|My God. I first viewed The Kids Are Alright about 10 years ago and when the film was over, and the smoke had cleared, I felt as if Pete himself had smashed me over the head with a Rickenbacker. That was the moment of my deeper understanding of the power + fury of The Who. When I recently purchased the special edition DVD, I felt like a little kid with a new toy and raced home to watch it, tearing open the packaging and fumbling with the booklet as I drove home. Seriously, I looked forward to seeing this more than any film Hollywood could EVER produce. Of course, I was very pleased with the entire film all over again. But I have one complaint: The TV performance of 'Pictures Of Lily' lasts for only a few seconds...anyone know where to find the full-length performance???
B0009WFFS6|4.0|I was initially skeptical,have read less than glowing reviews in the newspapers. However I would have to say the performances range from very good to moments of brilliance...come on it's 37 years later! what a perspective on their career colored by one's own life experiences.....long live Cream.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this boxed set blindly.  I had never seen an episode, but was going off of the hype surrounding the movie Serenity.  At first I was worried, I had read some reviews on the site saying that the fans had inflated the rating by spamming the site with multiple accounts.  But, after receiving and viewing the series I am glad to say the show deserves the 5 star rating it currently has.  This show was excellent and I can't believe it got cancelled.  Upon receiving it my friends and I watched the pilot episode and after viewing it everything else came to a standstill.  Plans for later that evening were cancelled as we proceeded to watch the first half of the boxed set.  We would have finished the whole series in a single setting, but unfortunately college classes and a calculus test got in the way, so we finished it the next day after classes got out.  There was not a single episode that went by that my friends and I didn't laugh out loud at the humor in the show, and there were many times that you were on the edge of your seat wondering what was going to happen next.  This could very well be the best television show I have ever seen and would highly recommend that anyone see it.
0393035158|5.0|\\"The End of Faith\\" makes sense out of nonsense. Harris presents a precise, rational, logical and academically authentic argument for reason over blind belief. The conflict is so emotionally charged, of course, that readers on the extreme ends of the argument will find the book reinforces their pre-existing positions, notwithstanding the curious irony of two seekers discovering their own versions of truth in a single, shiny nugget. Rationalists will welcome the case Harris makes; believers will see it as an another example of clever word-smithing against the Word, i.e. belief in any religion. <br />However, if you're looking for possible answers, valuable information and some glimmer of illumination on your personal quest for understanding of how the world works and why, \\"The End of Faith\\" will give you more than a little of what you're after. I found it enlightening for what it says, discouraging for what may lie ahead, but in the end hopeful.
0385512058|5.0|While I'll admit to buying this book for the title, thinking it would provide a tip sheet or something silly like that, it turned out to be an informative and rather quick read...actually I couldn't put it down.  I've read plenty of networking books, but this one is different - more personal and relationship based.  The section on media friendships was particularly helpful to me. I have dog-eared numerous pages for later reference and have recommended it to several friends.  Definitely one to check out if building your circle of friends and associates in important to you.  Good for small business start-ups too.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|There's a memorable scene in \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" where Morgan Freeman's character describes hearing opera for the first time and being transfixed by the music, even though he had no idea what the women were singing about. \\"Truth is, I don't want to know,\\" he says. \\"Some things are best left unsaid. I like to think they were singing about something so beautiful it can't be expressed in words, and it makes your heart ache because of it.\\"<br /><br />If you have no experience with Sigur Ros, read no further, because I can describe them no better than by stealing lines from Morgan Freeman. I'm sure I'm not the first person to make the connection, but I don't care, because it sums them up so perfectly; outside Italian opera, they are the best example of vocals so pretty you don't really want to understand them.<br /><br />Presumably, that's part of the plan--on this disc, they're singing in their native Icelandic, but on all previous albums, they sang in Hoplandic, a made-up dialect invented by the band themselves. (Apparently back then, it wasn't enough that fewer than 300,000 people in the world can speak Icelandic--they wanted nobody to understand them at all.)<br /><br />For the 6,445,834,663 non-Icelanders on the planet, of course, it makes no difference which of the two languages they sing in. Jon Thor Birgisson's voice glides in, out, above, around and through the songs like a shimmering, soaring bird. Our lack of understanding turns it into just another instrument. But what an instrument!<br /><br />Behind the voice, as always, are long, intense songs, epic tracks of stately icy beauty. \\"Glosoli\\" shimmers like a bright winter morning, with delicate music-box sounds leading into bright cold arcs of gorgeous sound, slow noises which give way in turn to charging rhythmic intensity, sounds that are as powerful as a glacier but as fast as a heartbeat. \\"Se lest\\" starts with a tender vibraphone before segueing into some lovely string arrangements and finishing with happy horns. (At least, I think it's a vibraphone--this group really skimps on the album booklet details. Not that I'm complaining.) Later, the album becomes slightly darker and more mournful, turns to winter night to complement the earlier arctic morning mood. Gong opens with mournful strings and finishes with more driving intensity, Anduari offers still more strings over a mellower arrangement, and the album finishes with some relatively unremarkable but very fitting tracks.<br /><br />If you know your Sigur Ros, here's what to know about \\"Takk\\": it is (as another reviewer has pointed out) a happier album than (), mellower and less intense, but equally beautiful and perhaps more varied in style and technique. Like that disc, though, it is an all-around better album (for my money) than \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\".<br /><br />Personally, I'm glad they don't sing in English. Their songs could be about toasters, or traffic jams, or mysterious body rashes, and I'd still be blasting them on desolate city evenings, listening in blissful ignorance of the meaning of what I'm listening to. But that's just fine by me--unlike, say, fellow Icelander Bjork, whose English-language lyrics sometimes clunk just a little, Sigur Ros always goes down smooth, unpolluted by intellectual understanding, connecting as pure music and emotion. Every album is like a postcard from Iceland that somehow got lost in the mail and found its way to your house: you may not be able to read the back, but the imagery, and the mystery, make it all the more beguiling.hing with happy horns.

B00008NGHI|5.0|This a review of the 5.1 SACD version.  Wow!  Great songs and wonderful performances combined with superb recording!  The sound on this 2 disc set is perfect.  Beautiful mix, with nice, wide sound stage, and all instruments at the right volume level.  This is why I invested in a good surround system.  Of course, this is presented from the audience perspective with the instruments up front, while letting the surround speakers add just the right amount of natural ambience and space. <br /> <br /> I might buy the DVD Video/DTS version just to compare, but the audio recording presented here is sublime.  The audience is super respectful, giving applause when called for, and giving silence when called for too, so that you don't miss one beautiful note.  This was easily worth the investment, especially for 2 discs.   <br /> <br />If you are an Alison Krauss & Union Station fan you have the choice of this, in uncompressed high resolution audio, or you could get the DVD video/DTS version, which I've read is also great.  If you are a gear head and want something to show off your new audio system, this will delight your ears and bring tears to your eyes.  Highest recommendation!
B00005JO0J|5.0|This film works even for those who are not part of the \\"Firefly Cult\\" Fast moving, characters you can care about and a perfect last few seconds. I hope there is another one in the works.
B00002Z88D|4.0|I thought this album was going to suck, but it is awsome. All of my faves are on here and the violins make them sound if better. \\"Battery\\" and \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" sounds the best. Metallica rules!!!! Slayer Sucks!!!
B000068IEU|1.0|The video qulaity of this dvd is terrible.   It looks looks a worn out videotape.   I have read elsewhere on the Internet, that the orginal film stock suffered water damage, and that the video on this dvd is a copy of a copy.   Looking at the picture, I believe it. <br /> <br />Now, on to my critique of the movie.   If this movie were relased today, It would just barely earn an R rating.   I was, quite frankly, disappoited with the sex & violence.   If this film were being made today, and it didn't have the all to breif nudity, you would think that it was a made for TV movie.
B00097A5HW|4.0|Highly recommend this CD to everyone.  Shakira is one of the many talented female artists today!
B00005V9IJ|4.0|This film wasn't too bad, I worried how Tom Hanks would do at such a role but this is also the man who made himself fit into the role as Forrest Gump so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. And he did well in this role as well. A lot of the movie is very quiet when he is on the island and you just watch him trying to survive alone on the island. I always worried there would be a threatening person or creature on the island that would eventually attack him but I guess they thought that Tom Hanks being alone on the island was more dramatic, and I could see that. This film has a feeling of great lonliness and that was the point and they did it well. And then at the end when he goes back home, not everything is perfect, or a happy ending. It's just an ending, that signifies a new beginning for Hank's character. A very realistic ending, and I was glad to see that.  <br /> <br />Overall I really did like this film. It's not the sort of film I always watch but Tom Hanks made it work to be an interesting film, and for most of the time a quiet one- and it's not easy for a film to be both interesting AND quiet so yes good job Cast Away.
B00005221M|3.0|\\"Ready, Aim, FIRE!\\" I think that this movie has good points, but also some bad parts. I think some of the good points are overall believable acting and intense battles. The parts I didn't like so much is how no one listens to the women and they are put in danger. Some others are how I didn't like so much were the violent, gory scenes and how some of the battles start to be a little unrealistic. Although I did like this movie it could have been better.     The actors in this movie were very believable. They did a fantastic job making the scenes seem like ones from a real war. The battles being acted were very intense, and most were very interesting. Some of the battle scenes put me on the edge of my seat, because the actors ready id make it seem real. The overall performance from the actors is probably one of the things that made this movie as good as it was.     All right, so I know that in the old times the women weren't ever listened to. But, the woman Alice and Cora in this movie were put in danger, because no one wanted to hear what they had to say. Even when Cora tried to defend Hawkeye to her father, he didn't care. The women were treated like little children for the most part and it wasn't fair. Those two had kept up with the men the whole time, and were very brave.     Okay the movie was good, but I didn't like all the violent, gory scenes. Yes it is okay to have a few but they had way to many. After some of the battles when people were killed or fighting they didn't show very well. It wasn't really believable to me when they scalped them or showed the bloody faces on the bodies that were just laying there. A few of the battles towards the end with the cannons and the sword fights became more unrealistic and unfair to the ones that were just left there dead.     This movie had very good actors and overall believable scenes, but it also had bad, violent, gory parts, and the two women weren't treated fair or listened to very much at all. I think the directorsand producers did a very good job on this movie and it had to take a lot of their effort but for the most part it paid off. I would definitely recommend this movie for others to watch because it is really good. The Last of the Mohicans represents the French-Indian war very well. A movie like this would be worth watching more than once.
0316172324|5.0|Intriguing, fascinating... the list could go on.  \\"Blink\\" sums up so perfectly what many of us feel, but can't put our finger on the \\"why.\\"  I was hooked from the first page, but found the final chapters even better.  It's well written, flows smoothly, and is put so that the average person can understand the entire process. <br />The various examples put forth show us how the mind can be manipulated and guided by suggestions. <br />I bought copies for friends, and will be ordering more...  I can see my copy being \\"loaned\\" and am looking forward to sharing and discussing the book with friends. <br />
B00008ADPF|5.0|I bought this CD in late 2004/early 2005, and at first I thought it was pretty lame. I only liked 4 songs on it, and they were all the faster songs. I actually bought this CD because I had \\"Feelin Way Too Damn Good\\" stuck in my head, and I wanted to know who sang it, since it'd been a year almost since I'd heard it on the radio.  <br /> <br />It actually took me several months to explore the whole CD and like all the songs. It's probably one, if not the only CD in my collection that I like all the songs on. So basically my point is that I really didn't like it in the beginning, but now I love it. <br /> <br />After buying the CD, Nickelback rapidly became one of my favorite bands, up there with 3 Doors Down.

B000002O5L|5.0|After the failure of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers 1987 album Let Me Up I've Had Enough, Petty came roaring back two years later with his first solo effort. Full Moon Fever is as good as anything Tom Petty has ever recorded. Petty sounds refreshed. The quality of the songs is terrific. This album spawned a handful of hits, and became one of Tom Petty's most popular albums. Full Moon Fever is a flawless disc, one of the best albums of rock n roll. Highlights include: Free Fallin, I Won't Back Down, Runnin Down a Dream, Zombie Zoo, and I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better. Petty's voice is also as clear in the mix as it's ever been. Full Moon Fever is a great and rewarding album, and deserves a place in everybody's cd collection.

B000000OMP|5.0|Buy the time 1984's Slide it In came out, Whitesnake had been around for seven years. I guess the time was right in the early 80's for Whitesnake's bluesy hard rock. Before the early 80's Whitesnake had been more popular in Europe than in the U.S.A., but finally in 1984 they got their chance in the U.S. Whitesnake is a great band, songs like Slide it In, Guilty of Love, and Slow An Easy still sound great coming out of the radio in 2000's. It's a crime that Whitesnake is globbed in with the hair bands, this is a great band!

B00000IFWE|1.0|Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers's Echo is a very laidback effort. Room at the Top is a pretty good song, but the majority of the songs sound to lazy and are unmemorable. Echo is a very lame album considering the highstandards Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers usually produce. Skip this one.
B000002UVZ|5.0|\\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" is R.E.M.'s best record perhaps because it came at a crossroads, as R.E.M. was emerging from college radio and only a couple of years away from MTV.  The jangling guitars of \\"Murmur\\" and \\"Reckoning\\" are still there, but the band rocks harder than before, and now you can hear the lyrics.  Regardless of whether you agree with Michael Stipe's politics, his word pictures of the consequences of rampant greed, government without compassion, and environmental rape are lyrically beautiful and powerfully sung.  Stipe has a great voice and these songs are his best because he became confident enough to mix the album so that we can hear what he's saying, but this album is also before the preachy excesses of some of his later songs in the 90's.  \\"Fall On Me\\" remains my favorite R.E.M. song, an emotional environmental lament.  Peter Buck and Mike Mills rock on \\"I Believe\\" and \\"These Days,\\" two songs worth hearing over and over again.  \\"Swan Swan H\\" is a sad song that is one of the last they would record in which they pay homage to their Southern roots.   <br /> <br />When this album came out, I thought R.E.M. was the greatest band in the world, bar none.  They went on to release a couple more great albums, and they continue to have some great songs, but this was R.E.M.'s high water mark.  If you already are a fan of the band, you already have it.  If you want to explore R.E.M., this is probably a good place to start. <br />
B000002LEM|4.0|Van Halen's second album with Sammy Hagar at the mike. This time Van Halen opens the formula up a bid with song like Finish What Ya Started with the country styled picking. The metalic Mine all Mine opens the album. OU812 is not one of my favorite Van Halen albums, but it is one of Van Halen's most expermential and interesting albums.
0345298349|5.0|Gorky Park, the opening book in a (to date) quartet of novels concerning a brilliant, socially disaffected detective from Moscow, is as much a tale of late Soviet life as it is a mystery and thriller. This novel begins after three bodies--two men and a woman, all of them young--are discovered in a melting snowbank outside one of Moscow's most popular theme parks. The bodies have been strategically mutilated so as to prevent identification and, despite any indications of a struggle, all three victims were shot at point blank range with a high powered handgun. From there, not only is identification made in a rather more swift fashion than the calculating killer imagined possible, but a complex plot involving government corruption, political dissidents, and the smuggling of one of the Soviet Union's most valued resources, is exposed. An edge of your seat drama, a sociological case study in dreary Soviet life, and a fine delving into the universal themes of human psychology, all set against the deadly, gripping cold of a Moscow winter. A really great book that starts off a really great series!
B000002MUQ|2.0|Balance is another letdown from Van Halen. Can't Stop Loving You and Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do are highlights. The remainder of the disc is boring.
B000006MS3|5.0|One of the first to use the Fairlight, Kate Bush uses it well on this album.   This is the first album Kate Produced by herself, and it is a masterpiece.  Although none of the tracks from The Dreaming are very radio friendly, the album is a sonic treat.  After over 20 years, there are still new surprises each time I listen.
B000002O1P|5.0|With 1985's Southern Accents, Petty and the boys decided to add some experiments to the album, adding touches of new waves and psychedelica to the mix this time. Southern Accents is a winner, while not as popular as some of Petty's other albums Southern Accents is one of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers most rewarding albums. Highlights include the opener Rebels, the psychedelic Don't Come Around Here No More, the ballad Southern Accents, Spike, and the Best of Everything. Do yourself a favor and get the highly underrated Southern Accents.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Robert Altman doesn't need to copy anyone.  The director of \\"Nashville\\" and the film version of \\"M*A*S*H\\" has a recognizable style that would serve as an excellent template for ensemble cast films. In Gosford Park he applies that wonderfully witty style to a production that initially looks like one of those wonderful Merchant-Ivory features with gentlemen in tuxedos and ladies in elegant gowns strolling around a British Manor.<br /><br />The cast is chock-a-block full of gifted English performers - some of them recognizable to American viewers:  Maggie Smith, Ryan Phillippe, Helen Mirren, Michael Gambon just before donning the long beard of Albus Dumbledore in the most recent Harry Potter films, Kristin Scott Thomas.  \\"Look, there's.... whatsisname\\" I thought often.<br /><br />The story establishes a busy \\"upstairs/downstairs\\" feel as the rich and titled are invited to visit the manor of Bambon's Sir William McCordle for a shooting party. Those rich lords and ladies walk and talk and gossip upstairs while downstairs the equally interesting maids and butlers walk and talk and gossip.<br /><br />About halfway through the film one of the titled is murdered and the rest of the film follows the outline of one of those Agatha Christie whodunits, but the richness and complexity of the characters and their interactions with one another are in a definite Altman style that make you care about these characters and whodunit in a way that is deeper than Dame Agatha's fine stories.  You find that half of the upstairs houseguests have a motive, and you discover the same about the servants downstairs.  The movie pays meticulous attention to the distinction between classes and position and income. Maggie Smith Sir William's Sister, Constance, is by position the Countess of Trentham, but she is completely dependent on her brother's allowance to maintain even the appearance of a lavish lifestyle.  The servants downstairs know that they are not in the class of those upstairs, but they are further divided in that their rank among the fellow servants is reflected by the rank of their employer.  At the servant's dinner table they are seated by the rank of their boss upstairs.  They are even called by the name of their employer.<br /><br />Altman definitely differs from Christie in that you come to form sorts of emotional attachments to some of these characters. By the denouement you have come to care about what has happened, and the weight of whodunit has a depth that is far beyond simply \\"who's going to jail\\".  It's a rewarding way to spent a couple of hours.ut they are further divided in that their rank among the fellow servants is reflected by the rank of their employer.

B000000OYN|4.0|Whitesnake's Saints and Sinners came out two years before their first big U.S. hit Slide it In. Saints and Sinners is of special interest because two songs off of Saints and Sinners would latter resurface on Whitesnake's 1987 self-titled release. Both Crying in the Rain and Here I Go Again were rerecorded for Whitesnake's 1987 album, with a few changes in lyrics on Here I Go Again. It's a shame this band didn't make years earlier.

B0000025RI|5.0|Michael Jackson's Thriller made him into pop music's biggest superstar of the 1980's. Thriller also held the #1 position on the Billboard album charts for what seemed like forever! While not a big fan of dance pop myself, I do however find Thriller to be an appealing album, worthy of it's success and the praise it's gotten over the years. With such a great voice, and a solid bunch of songs to support it Thriller truly is one of the greatest albums of all-time. It's pointless to name highlights here, cause this is one of those albums everysong is a highlight!
6305897786|5.0|The basic premise of the Ninth Gate is that a book dealer: Corso (Depp) is hired by an eccentric book collector to authenticate a rare occult text rumored to open the gates of hell. Only 3 copies have survived the sands of time and fires of the inquisition. Depp must examine the other 2 copies, and retrieve the real version \\"at all costs\\". <br /> <br />If you are looking for the typical Hollywood drivel, then this movie is not for you. If you want a well-written, intelligent supernatural-suspense film, then watch The Ninth Gate. The film is littered with symbolism, and many subtleties that only become evident after watching the movie a second or third time. I found myself scratching my head wondering how I missed these on the first viewing. If you have an interest in the occult, then you will enjoy the film on another level as well (i.e. the illustrations in the book resemble the Rider-Waite Tarot, the book itself is reminiscent of grimoires like the Lesser Key of Solomon, and the Abbe de Torqia brings to mind 'heretics' like Giordano Bruno). <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this movie has probably earned a lower rating than it should have. Half of the poor reviews seem to have been written by adolescent bimbos who watched the movie because they think Johnny Depp is dreamy. The other half by dimwits who expected demons with bad prosthetics to jump around and eat peoples' entrails. God forbid something not be spelled out, or left open ended in order to make you think for yourself! <br />.
B000065AI3|5.0|Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers 1976 self titled released is probably the band's most underappreciated album. The album didn't really spawn any hits when it first came out. Breakdown became a hits about two years after the release of the album. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers contains fan favorites and hits such as American Girl and Breakdown, as well as many more fine tunes such as Mystery Man, The Wild One, Strangered in the Night, and HOmetown Blues. If you enjoyed Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers Greatest Hits and would like to dig deeper into their catalog, you should check out this their 1976 self titled album.
B0009MAO46|5.0|I had originally bought this movie when it first came out on VHS when my older son was little...I have an 8 year old who was not too interested in watching on VHS...but once I got the DVD and all the extras he wants to watch all the time.

B00005ABKC|3.0|While two years came between Damn the Torpedoes and Hard Promises, Hard Promises tends to be the weakest entry in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers catalog so far. There are classic Petty tunes here like The Waiting and Insider, but much of the filler is weaker than it had been on previous albums. Songs like Nightwatchman tend to be rather goofy to me. Hard Promises is still a worthwhile edition to your Tom Petty collection, but it is just not as good as the albums that came before it.
B0001RVTXO|5.0|I'm laying on my coach watching Fight Club for the first time while being stoned for the first time.  You can only imagine what that could be like.  Then I hear the distant howls and the back of my head the guitar and drums kick in and the movie ends.  I sat there and stared at my tv listening to the song. The next day a looked for the song and bought Wave of Mutilation:The Best of the Pixies. <br />At first I didn't like it so much because the only song I really knew was 'Where Is My Mind',then I really started to listen. To anyone who bought the CD thinking of where is my mind there are many other great tracks. <br />Check These Out: <br />  Gigantic <br />  Hey <br />  Monkey Gone to Heaven <br />  Debaser <br />  Gouge Away <br />  Wave of Mutilation <br />  Dig For Fire <br />  Here Comes Your Man <br /> <br />After all that your mind will change.

B000002MUN|4.0|Wildflowers is Tom Petty's second solo outing, following the highly successful Full Moon Fever. As on Full Moon Fever many of the Heartbreakers appear on various tracks.

0671015206|5.0|This book is an excellent companion for budgeting personal finances.  While it does not give a nuts-and-bolts approach as to how to manage one's money, it does give some bedrock principles that will help a person live below his/her means.  The authors here present the case that there are many millionaires in our country who don't appear to be millionaires.  The reason is that the focus of their lives is on building wealth, not consuming goods.  They are also frugal, a quality that most non-millionaires don't possess.<br /><br />This book is an excellent read.  I recommend it highly not as an instructional book on good money management, but as a motivational book on money management.  It is well worth the small price!
B00000DCH9|3.0|Billy Joel's Piano Man is a fine early effort for Joel. While not as impressive as his late 70's early 80's albums, Piano Man does feature no less than three really good songs. Piano Man, Captian Jack, and Ballad of Billy the Kid. The remainder of the album is plesant, but not as memorable.
B00003CXCT|3.0|First off for the people who complain about the changes to the films, I have some compassion for you, but if you are a true blue fan like me, you have to get over it as I have. You can forget about seeing the original films on dvd unless you get them pirated. George made the changes because he thinks it tells the story more completely. The buzz now is the next release of the movies will be in 3-D. Now on to the review. Ok here goes. A new hope is I think a near perfect movie now with the changes,the tweaked trench run is really breathtaking and I love the improved Jabba/Han part as well. Really the only bad part is when the big beast walks right in front of camera when Ben and Luke are getting into Mos Eisley.  In the case of Empire you have to get used to the changes because the film was perfect the way it was. The biggest change to Empire is the added stuff with the wampa which I don't think was needed, and Mark Hamill has a couple of extra lines. They also redid the emperor's transmission with vader on the star destroyer which did not bother me much at all. It spruces up the film a bit. There is also a little more of when Boba Fett follows the Falcon to Bespin. The worst change to empire is when Leia and Lando are fleeing cloud city. There is an added part of Vader going to his ship, who cares we know where he is going, it screws up the tempo of the film,when it was perfect the way it was. Jedi's changes are I think the least important of the 3 film's. The improved sarlac pit is nice,and they added a lot to the band's performance in Jabba's palace, also a little when the slave girl is killed at Jabba's. And they added some parts at the end that shows different places celebrating when the empire is defeated. (Corusant, Tatooine,cloud city,etc.) and a little added ewok partying too, (of course). But the one change that bothers most people including myself is Hayden at the end, which I can't understand because Yoda and Ben's vision's were in their old form, and thenyou put in the young Anakin. But some one will have to take that up with George. The bonus disc has the empire of dreams documentry, which is really great. The birth of the lightsaber was pretty good as well. The other two documentries are enjoyable, but I think the really diehard fans might like the production stills and the trailers. The improved sound and picture alone is reason enough to buy because the digital remastering is breathtaking, it sometime's makes me feel like I'm 6 again, (PRICELESS). One good idea they had was an audio channel for all three film's that has commentary from the film makers and still has the film's sound at a lower volume. I thought the bonus features disc could have been a little better. But the reason I say that is because the original star wars trilogy is the best sci-fi saga ever told, and because the bonus disc that comes with Attack of the clones is so awesome. Well that's my 2 cents worth if you have too many doubts try renting before you buy. May the force be with you! P.S. Now that 1,2,3, are done A.O.T.C. and R.O.T.S. are the two good films. Clones is much better than Sith because more Natalie Portman, a better story, and come on, that lightsabre battle between Obiwan and Anakin while somewhat spectacular is completely unrealistic. They both would have been killed at about 8 mins in. As they do in Sith about 40X. End of review SWIPE!! If you want to read about mistakes in the films go to IMDB.COM, go to the film you want, and goofs.
B0002OERI0|3.0|I am editing this because of something Aloona said.  So what are you saying there? That only only people you want to see are ones that agree with you? Oh and the reason why we post that is to make sure people avoid crap when it is there. This they should espically avoid. Why? *better reasons in the review* Because morons like you fall into whatever is told by you that is good. You have a prorblem with me using your idiotic word? DEAL WITH! Also how is that even logical? We are stupid because we click no? Because we disagree with you? That just doesn't make sense. It's called opinions Aloona , we all have em. and my opinion is your a self centered brat that doesn't know good music. There I said? Think I care? It's basically the same thing you called everyone who didn't give it 5 stars. I don't care if you see this or not. Just like venting steam when I see an idiot like you.    Onto the review:  I never really liked Green Day so I know people will disagree with me because of that , but seriously people. This band, all of thier songs sound the same....well they used to. They fixed it now, but still. This band may finally  have gotten some new riffs and drum beats into thier heads, but they still havn't proven they are good. American Idiot is a little remisent of Nirvana, with it's pointless screaming and sudden guitar riffs out of no where. The music of Green Day does not flow smoothly. Sure there a few good songs to be found, but it ain't worth it to buy the album. This is better media induced crap, but still the stuff that the media shows is usually way overrated and usually isn't good. *I.e.: ff7, nirvana,....and pretty much any band that is out today....cept gorillaz and the pillows* It shows here, not as clearly as most, but it still shows. I reccomend just asking froma  friend if they can burn the good songs from this cd onto a cd. *american idiot is not a good one*  IE: Holiday      Boulverd of broken dreams      Jesus of Surburbia      and that is about it. There are a few others, but still it ain't worth it to buy the album  My advice: just ask a friend to burn the songs that are actually good
076113719X|4.0|I saw this calendar at a friend's and had to get one. The layout is perfect for moms, with separate weekday spaces for each family member. Once you get used to the unusual visual layout (week days are stacked vertically rather than the standard horizontal layout of most calendars) it's a big help in organizing your time. If Boynton ever makes the daily spaces a little larger, (personally I wouldn't mind if the calendar were larger as I hang it on a door anyway) I'll give her that fifth star, but otherwise, it's a wonderful calendar.
B000003TA4|2.0|As some of you may know , i wrote a review on FF7. Said it was the most overrated game of all time. and this the most overrated band of all time. Nirvana, copied from many people. If you pay close attention to the songs then compare them to bands that came before, it's the exact same song with different lyrics and screaming so people won't know it's the same. Though many still figured that out  they don't care. People call them amazing. All they did was copy off of people. THey did nothign amazing. Infact most of thier other cds just plain suck. There I said it, kill me. I frankly don't care what people think when i say it sucks. Kurt Cobain = the biggest hypocrite of all time. He claims he didn't want to be mainstream, but he always was. That is why he ultimately killed himself. He got himself caught in a situation. and yes i know attacking the band is bad for all of you that worship this garbage, but simply put. Nirvana's lyrics, riffs, and screaming are competely uninspired. This band had no originalyity and has no reason to be called one fo the greatest of all time, but it still is. Why? Because people will believe anything the media throws at them. Just look at FF7. If I wanted incoherent screaming with quite possibly the most annoying  songs of all, i'd watch a tv channel with a really bad fuzz problem , that plays music. <br />
B0001CCXGG|5.0|Great CD to listen to while hanging around the house. I was a little disappointed that the songs satriani plays in the dvd set was not exactly the same as found on this disc. Turns out the dvd and the cd were recorded at two different locations. I would have liked the live version of Starry Night on this cd. However, Satriani's Mystical Potato Head Groove Thing is amazing live. I bought the dvd as well as this disc since alternate set lists were played in the dvd (Yngwie's dvd set is much better in my opinion). It's a whole new level to see it in addition to hearing it. And of course the G3 jam is crazy as always. Although the songs are the same for the G3 jam, the guitar playing and solos in the songs are different than on the dvd since the three improvised their riffs on stage. I like the dvd version but the cd is still worth the money.
B000000P17|2.0|This album isn't as good as some reviewers have said and isn't as bad as others would lead you to believe.  It's in a different universe than Appetite..., but if you're a fan, & U can get a copy for next to nothing, it's worth owning.  To me, the best songs are both on track 12-\\"I Don't Care About You\\" and (on the original release, the one I recommend getting) the Charles Manson penned tune \\"Look at Your Game, Girl\\".  I still have trouble believing that Axl sung \\"I Don't Care About You\\".  It doesn't even sound like anything he's ever done-he had talent.  As far as why this album came out when it did has to do with Izzy Stradlin's departure from the band.  I've heard, more than once, that he wrote A LOT of the material, particularly on Appetite...  He wrote \\"Don't Cry\\" and \\"Patience\\" also.  He was more important to them than they really knew.  Gilby is as good a player as Izzy, but he's not (or WAS not) the creative force that Izzy was/is.  Since Izzy left shortly after the Illusion albums came out, and GNR hasn't done anything original since (not much anyway), it strikes me as more than a coincidence that they (basically) broke up after squeezing all they could out of the Illusion tour(s).  Without Izzy, they no longer had the creative direction that had gotten them to where they were at this point in time (the early 90s).  Axl, Duff, and Slash have written some cool stuff, but none of them equalled the total output (in quality anyway) that Izzy produced.  He wasn't crucial as far as touring went, but when it came to writing, he was both indespensible AND irreplaceable.  It isn't the same GNR without Izzy-he was there in the beginning and his writing contributions were largely responsible for the success of the band.  Other notable songs are \\"New Rose\\", \\"Attitude\\", \\"Down on the Farm\\", and a good, though insincere, version of \\"Since I Don't Have You\\".  If I had to pick one song as the absolute best, it would be the Manson song.  It's sad, oddly catchy, with minor chords that really hit the spot.  The arrangement is sparse, which adds a dissonance and a loneliness to the song that give it a sincerity that the other songs lack.  There's a certain amount of hollow arrogance, even a \\"We've done all this sh@# before-here, now you listen to it because we don't have any quality original songs anymore\\"-type of attitude about the other songs.  Partially because these are covers, and partially because they're not that exciting (as far as GNR goes), this album hasn't held up well over time.  These are mostly phoned in versions of songs that weren't that great to begin with.  That said, if you can pick up a copy for a few dollars, I think it's worth it as there are a couple of decent tracks to be found on this album.
B00005MP58|3.0|This production of Pride & Prejudice is incredible; one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately, the quality of this \\"Special Edition\\" DVD is horrible. What bothered me the most was the unsychronized audio/video, and the shadowy lighting that blurred the lines between hair and background, etc.  <br />  But besides that, the special features were hardly worth mentioning. I was expecting at least the standard deleted scenes, maybe a blooper reel, or at least decent subtitles. All that was included were a couple written biographies and one featurette that was sadly lacking in any kind of interesting stories from on set, details about the actual production, or interviews with more of the great cast members. I found that the clips from the movie that they used throughout the featurette were too long as well. <br /> This DVD set is nowhere near the quality of the actual production: don't miss watching this movie, but consider watching it on VHS or the older DVD instead.
B000063DIR|1.0|Yoko Ono multiplied by a thousand? Meet Sharon Osbourne. Was the TV show amusing? Sure, make Ozzy the Al Bundy of heavy metal music. What comes next? Removing drum and bass tracks so you don't have to pay the original musicians? A new low and a new lame. Sharon Osbourne pulling the plug on Iron Maiden during the Ozzfest, or staging hecklers? May Eddie sodomize Sharon in hell, where she'll assuredly be headed. She's turned Ozzy into a joke. Tell her to take all these \\"reissues\\" and stuff them. By the way, the Ultimate Sin album still exists, no matter how much you try to ignore it, Sharon.

B000000OQF|5.0|This is without doubt my favorite album ever. The sonic harmony between everyone in the entire band, especially the interplay between Slash and Izzy is just incredible. Every song on the album except for about 2 are just incredible. Slash is just amazing. I can't sufficiently put how good this is into words - i suggest you buy it and listen to the interaction between band members, and how complex the songs always are, whether they sound simple or not. Just incredible

B0000640VO|5.0|just writing for the star rating, to give it my 5 - one of my favorite movies. Up there with Moulin Rouge
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've heard enough of people saying \\"This album is horrible. Listen to their older stuff\\" and \\"they've lost it!\\" Those people are simply afraid of change, and they won't accept the fact that the band has matured. Don't get me wrong, their older stuff is great...Dookie and Nimrod are my 2 favorite albums in my collection. However, this CD showcases their talent more. The songs show off Billie Joe's amazing voice (especially the thought-provoking last track of the CD, \\"Whatsername\\"), Mike's flawless basswork is evident, and more than ever, Tre's drumming is amazing. The guitar riffs are great, too, I might add. <br /> <br />I don't think that people should listen to the songs on the radio withought buying the album. The CD tells a story- kind of like The Who's Tommy, yet more subtle. It's very complex, and hard to figure out, but if you listen to it enough times, I suppose you get a rough idea of what it's about. People don't realize that Boulevard Of Broken Dreams isn't just another rock-ballad; it's the aftermath of \\"Holiday\\", the hangover, it's about finding yourself.  <br /> <br />Well, onto the review. The album starts off with \\"American Idiot\\", and ubeat track with lots of guitar and lots of profanities. After that ends, \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" begins- a 5-part, 9 minutes and 8 seconds montage. This track tells the story of the Jesus of Suburbia, and sort of introduces the character. Part 2 of \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is \\"City of The Damned\\", a sort of slow song about growing up in a city full of violence and poverty. Next come \\"I Don't Care\\" and \\"Dearly Beloved\\", two shorter songs and, in my opinion, the best part of the montage. \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" ends with \\"Tales From Another Broken Home\\", an explosive anthem that really sums up the track. After \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\", \\"Holiday\\" begins...I have nothing to say about this song but \\"Long live political satire.\\" \\"Holiday\\" transitions into \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", probably the most overrated song on the album, but stillone of my favorite tracks. \\"Are We The Waiting\\" comes next...whenever I hear this song, I can picture a crowd of people with candles waving their hands. It sounds like more than one person is singing it. \\"St. Jimmy\\" is probably one of the best songs on the CD...vintage Green Day. The next song is \\"Give Me Novacaine\\"...slow, yet edgy. Billie Joe's voice sounds great in the song, and I like the guitar solo towards the end. \\"She's A Rebel\\" is all about Whatsername, and sung from Jimmy's point of view. (If you don't own the album, which is probably why you're reading this review in the first place, you're probably not familiar with the terminology.) \\"Extrordinary Girl\\" begins as soon as \\"She's A Rebel\\" ends. It starts off with a percussion part that sounds lke it came straight out of Aladdin, and the chorus is catchy, but the lyrics are kind of shallow and un-Green Day-ish; oh well, that's just my opinion. \\"Letterbomb\\" comes next, probably the most underrated song on the album, yet one of my favorites. It's one of the few Green Day songs where Billie Joe actually screams into the microphone. (\\"She\\" is the only other one I can recall.) \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is number 11 on the CD- a slow, moving ballad with a great guitar solo near the end. I'm not sure how it fits into the storyline; personally, I think it's more about Billie Joe's dad than anything else. \\"Homecoming\\" comes next, the other 9-minute montage on the album, featuring \\"The Death of St. Jimmy\\", \\" East 12th Steet\\", \\"Nobody Likes You\\" (written and performed by Mike Dirnt), \\"Rock 'n Roll Girlfriend\\" (written and performed by Tre Cool), and \\"We're Coming Home Again\\". Perfect punk rock opera material. The CD ends with \\"Whatsername\\", a dark, provocative song that really shows off Billie's voice. A great way to end a great album. <br /> <br />I disagree with what a lot of people are saying about the album; personally, I think that it's one of their best-right up there with Nimrod and Insomniac. It's stillthe same old Green Day- great instrumentals, an edgy \\"punk\\" feel, slightly explicit lyrics. The band still plays their old hits like \\"Longview\\" and \\"Basket Case\\" at concerts. I don't think they've \\"grown up\\" completely, their sound is just getting better. Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tre Cool don't want to be mature..they're just a lot smarter than anybody thinks. <br /> <br />Overall, an amazing CD...well worth the money. A great addition to any collection. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNQA|3.0|Kidman and Penn, what a great idea (truly) to have them together. But. Throw together a plot that is so plodding and boring and convoluted my husband had to wake me up on the sofa.  This film had a few good and interesting scenes, it just took forever to get through.
B000002MP2|5.0|One of the greatest albums of all time by the greatest band of all time- it just doesn't get any better than this! From the hypnotic bassline and raging chorus of \\"Longview\\" to the catchy, slightly-whiny punk sound of \\"Basket Case\\", Green Day has truly produced a masterpiece. Tre's drumming skills are amazing, especially in \\"Basket Case\\", and I may sound sort of old-fashioned by saying this, but Billie Joe plays a mean guitar. Green Day is just as enduring as bands such as The Ramones, and their music will be remembered for generations to come, unlike the Hilary Duffs and Justin Timberlakes that plaque today's entertainment. Another thing on the album that I'm blown away by is Billie Joe Armstrong's voice. It's got a great, melodic tone to it and never ceases to impress me, yet he still manages to add an edgy, punk-rock feel to it.  <br /> <br />Some of the stand-out tracks on the album are: Longview, When I Come Around, Basket Case, Having A Blast, Eminus Sleepus (the only song on the album written by Mike Dirnt) Welcome to Paradise, She, and F.O.D- they're all great, of course. There's even a hidden track at the end of the CD called All By Myself, performed by Tre Cool...well worth the wait of 2 minutes and something-seconds after F.O.D.  <br /> <br />Green Day is everything a punk rock band should be- fun, upbeat,in-your-face, swears in their lyrics, and most of all, talented! This CD came out in 1994, and is still appreciated by rock fans everywhere. If an album debued in 1994 and you can still listen to it 11 years later an enjoy it, then it must be good.
B000AL730Y|5.0|I would have given this album 2 stars after my first few listens. The formula of a McCartney album wasn't there; you know: a few rockers, then a ballad, some more rockers, a couple of ballads, etc.<br /><br />This album is mostly a quiet one, and seems to focus heavily on the more the elemental sounds of the instrumentation and vocals.<br /><br />Several weeks later, I have no choice but to put it up there with McCartney's best works. It is beautifully crafted, seems to stick on theme most of the way through (friendship, loss and love), and has several of those McCartney vocal and melodic hooks throughout. The McCartney-esque hooks are more subtle, but they're killer. The songs themselves are generally brief, which goes to what seems, at least for this album, a purer form of production - very artistic for a legendary artist for our time.<br /><br />Love it!
0316172324|5.0|Mr. Gladwell's work is a similar to data that was introduced in \\"Emotional Intellegence\\" by Daniel Goleman and \\"Wisdom of Crowds\\" by James Surowiecki. Both books brought forward much of the data that is presented in this book.<br /><br />However Mr. Gladwell really makes you think about the power of snap judgments. It is a difficult subject. We are really good at somethings and really bad at other. The book \\"Mean Genes\\" was very good at looking at where we fall short on our snap judgments. They noted that in areas like number greater than a few dozen we get into trouble. We really can't understand that our chance at winning a lottery are virtually zero, etc. I wish Mr. Gladwell had added these areas.<br /><br />Overall I like the book. It made me think. It gave me idea, and that is why I read.
B00005JKG9|5.0|This \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" movie has been criticised for being considerably unrealistic and overblown.  At the core of the movie's plot is 4 real estate salesmen involved in a do-or-die contest--the top two sellers win a Cadillac Eldorado and a set of steak knives respectably, not to mention getting to keep their jobs, while the bottom two are to be fired.  Perhaps this whole contest setup is a bit far-fetched in terms of real-life, but the resulting movie is extremely compelling anyway, with its dog-eat-dog nature being gripping and easy to identify with.  And of course, there's the acting...  The late Jack Lemmon is at his best here, once again playing the role of a man who's emotionally distraught and at the end of his rope (very much like his role in 1975's \\"The Prisoner of Second Avenue\\").  Alec Baldwin landed the role of a lifetime as a no-holds-barred executive who comes to give the salesmen a \\"motivational speech\\" (ahem), and his superb performance is simply devastating.  Ed Harris and Alan Arkin each deliver brilliant performances as well--the Harris' character is filled with rage, and Arkin's character is basically a defeatist.  Kevin Spacey plays the office manager, and his performance is fittingly cold-blooded.      In regard to the double disc DVD version, you get widescreen as well as full screen versions of the feature, plus some great bonus material including intriguing commentary from Baldwin and Arkin (individually, not together).  Yes, it is a shame that Jack Lemmon's commentary featured on the SE Laserdisc version isn't included here, although do you get an interview segment with Lemmon from \\"The Charlie Rose Show\\".  Considering the list price of this 2 disc package, and with the movie itself being so arresting and compulsively watchable, you really can't go wrong getting this.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|Now, for visuals I would definitely give \\"Final Fantasy: Advent<br /><br />Children\\" a 9 out of 10.

After all, this form of<br /><br />animation is to replicate realism as seen by the human eye, whereas a<br /><br />traditional animated feature allows you to enjoy the impressionism. For<br /><br />some reason, the big eyes just seemed weird to me, up to the credits at<br /><br />the end of the film.<br /><br />As for story...what story? Everyone is saying it's an amazing story,<br /><br />well, it is if you neglect a little something called plot. There is<br /><br />none.

0385486804|4.0|It seems that some of the other reviewers have already given you an outline of the book (I never understand that) so I won't tell you the story. <br /> <br />This book was a gift that sat on my shelf for a while. I grabbed it last week as I was walking out the door on my way to the airport. By the time I landed, I was hoping my ride was late. Seriously, I don't say this often, but I couldn't put it down. <br /> <br />This is a really interesting book on several levels. It is basically about a college-aged kid who doesn't want to give into modern comforts. It's about going off into the middle of nowhere, in search of something more. While I don't have the guts to drop everything and go looking for myself, and am intrigued by people like Chris (the subject) who have done exactly that. It kind of makes you think about what's important to you. <br /> <br />Some people will argue that Chris was a nut...a guy who made a stupid series of decisions that cost him his life. I'm not so sure. Yeah, he died young, but he probably understood the bigger picture a lot more than the vast majority of us. You should really read this book to get a sense of where YOU stand. <br /> <br />Bottom line, you will enjoy \\"Into the Wild\\" if you have ever thought about packing a rucksack of everything that is important to you and hitting the road.  <br />
4789011623|5.0|Not sure why all the reviews here are for the textbook because these are the Audio CDs for the Genki I textbook.<br /><br />I just purchased them from Amazon and received them in the mail today. The first CD contains audio for the main Genki I Textbook while the second CD contains audio for the Genki I Workbook.<br /><br />The publishers website mentions a 6 CD set but I have been unable to find them anywhere... even from the publishers website. Up until now I had been using audio cassettes that the school provided. There are 6 of them so maybe there was just some confusion.<br /><br />The main textbook, workbook, and audio CDs equal a great learning experience. I'm about 3/4ths of the way through it, learning with a small group. It's been a lot of fun and one of the easier language immersions I've experienced. Do you need the CDs to learn the language? I'd say yes... for a while I avoided listening to the audio, only depending on the class sessions to train my ear instead. After so many classes I found myself falling behind and unable to understand the teacher because she started to talk at a normal speed and in full sentences. Doing the homework with these audio CDs are a great help.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|I tried to like this, honestly I did, Grohl's vocals just don't do it for me like they did on One by One and Colour and the Shape, I have trouble listening to this CD all the way through. I want the Foo's to do well and put out a new CD to amend for this, but I can't help that. <br /> <br />for the record, the copy protection, as most others have said is a terrible idea, I listen to my ipod more than any CD and if I can't put it on there I'm less inclined to listen at all.

B000301YY8|4.0|Splitting the difference between David Gray and John Mayer surprisingly evenly, get ready for the next British success story to try to make it on our shores.  (And fear not, he's 180 degrees from Natasha Bedingfield, whose ho-hum reception here remains the mystery of the year, without question.)  His songwriting is achingly simple (almost too earnest to be believed), but that's most of the beauty of it:  everybody at some point in their lives has had an experience like the one Blunt's amazing voice sings of in his debut single, \\"You're Beautiful,\\" in which his lead character sees the woman of his dreams and wonders if he'll ever get a second look.  Superstars have made it on far less than being able to write a song that the entire world can relate to.  Definitely one to keep an eye on.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I looked forward to this disk with not a small amount of apprehension. Cream was my favorite band when I was learning to play guitar, and it had been 36 years since I'd last seen them. All were approaching 60, Jack Bruce had recently suffered a bout of cancer, Ginger Baker had spent a number of years on heroin, and Eric Clapton had been more of a balladeer in recent years. Could they still play that firey 60s material with feeling?<br /><br />Yes, indeed they could. The sound is a bit different, and not exactly the way it was in the 60s, but they sounded as musical as ever, and in many ways better. Those hoping for a carbon copy of the studio performances of the 60s will be a bit dissapointed- but not much. Clapton manages to play in the style he left in the 60s while bringing to it some of the sophistication he's picked up since. He's a bit more melodic, playing arpeggios where he once played block chords (as in White Room) but it all works. Bruce can still hit all the notes, and his bass playing is as alive as I've ever heard. And Baker is, if anything, even better than he was in the 60s. His obligatory solo on \\"Toad\\" reminded me more than a little of Max Roach, one of his heroes, He may not have the flash of some younger drummers, but he's tremendously musical in his soloing.<br /><br />Not every song I wanted to here is represented, but all the favorites- Sunshine, Crossroads, White Room- are here, along with some compositions never heard live outside the studio, like Baker's \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\". Some of the more orchesteral Bruce compositions, like \\"We're Going Wrong\\" work very well on stage.<br /><br />Yes, it's not exactly the Cream of 1967-68, but it's still a tremendous performance that both brought back old memories and created some new ones. Six stars.
B000AA305M|5.0|The album is ten tracks deep, it's called \\"Life in Slow Motion,\\" and it lands 12.7 miles on the other side of magnificent.  Recorded in a honest-to-God studio (not one of those ramshackle bedroom outfits whereupon all of his previous works have been born) with a real producer (Marius DeVries, who has worked with U2 and Beck, among others, and who last year turned Sarah McLachlan's touching-on-twee \\"World on Fire\\" into a ferociously sleek firebird with his spectacular remix), it's an album of instruments.  The star of the show, of course, remains Gray's superlative voice, but the addition of strings, and guitars, and real freakin' drums is incalculably engrossing.  Only one of the album's songs - the bizarrely-sung, ridiculously-titled \\"From Here You Can Almost See the Sea\\" - is a full-on failure; two more - \\"Ain't No Love\\" (which seems to reveal that this year's love might not have lasted after all) and \\"Lately\\" (armed with one of the great final minutes any song ever had, look for this to be a future single) - instantly take their place among Gray's ten best.<br /><br />And then there's \\"The One I Love.\\"  For an artist whose canon largely - and might I add effectively - hinges on a cleverly-paced wordplay, the haunting simplicity of this song - three verses-as-snapshots buffering a chorus that is all of thirteen words long - is downright revolutionary.  Each stanza joins a story in progress - a couple parting ways for good, a soldier dying on a battlefield (as Rolling Stone put it, this is likely the most beautiful song about bleeding to death that you're going to run across), a lonely soul remembering dancing - but by the end of it, you feel as if you've just watched as fourteen hour miniseries.  It's that strong, and for all its disparate yearning, it's that cohesive.  And, though I'm sure that at least two people (names of Bedingfield and Broussard) are gonna have much to say about it, it seems like the the title of 2005's best single is Gray's to lose.
1400032717|5.0|If you are in a mental health field and grapple as I do with the definitions and descriptions of Autism or Asperger's Syndrome as laid out by our wonderful diagnostic manual, I would suggest a turn to literature and to books like \\"curious incident...\\" for a better understanding.  I don't know where Mark Haddon gained his insights, but he has done a wonderful job of portraying the perceptions and coping strategies of the autistic-like Christopher as he attempts to solve the murder of a neighbor's dog.  Equipped with a brilliant mathematical mind but no mechanisms for undestanding the motivations and machinations of the adults around him, Christopher's search takes him unwittingly into the snarl of the failed relationships and emotional limitations of the adults around him, including his parents. You the reader will perceive elements sad and poignant between the lines of Christopher's narrative. The story resolves in a way that I think will be satisfying to most readers.  It is also a quick read and hard to put down.  For another excellent book with a high functioning autistic/asperger's character, I would highly recommend Elizabeth Moon's recent book, _The Speed of Dark_.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I have been a fan of the musical version of Phantom since my teens. It moves me... the story of unrequited love was one that always resonated deeply.  <br /> <br />The movie version of the musical moved me as well, there were many well done segments. The overall cinematography was also impressive (the black and white scenes were a nice touch).  <br /> <br />HOWEVER I have a couple of serious complaints about how the Phantom was represented. None of them have to do with Gerard Butler per se. I actually like him a lot as an actor, he was great in Attilla. My complaints instead have to do with the way the character was portrayed in the movie from a directorial angle.  <br /> <br />First off he is much too young and dashing. The Phantom is supposed to be someone who has nurtured Christine for a good portion of her life, and appeared as a surrogate father to her, who happens to fall in love with his student. Instead we get a swashbuckling romantic leading man type character who we have a hard time either identifying with or pitying. And pity is the one thing we must have for the Phantom in order for the character to truly work. The fact that he hides his face when first unmasked doesn't help this fact either (not to mention it makes the accompanying song make much less sense). Suffice to say it is hard to pity a man who is better looking than oneself, deformities aside.  <br /> <br />The other complaint I had was dealing with the mystical nature of the character. It seems that Joel Schumacher took pains to point out what the Phantom had up his sleeve for almost every disaster. He no longer shoots fire from his staff, he draws a sword. It is no longer a mystery how he makes Carlotta lose her voice, now it is simply a matter of him tainting her throat spray. All of this makes a more plausible story, but this story isn't SUPPOSED to be about plausibility, it is a  romantic and fantastic spectacle. Joel didn't seem to feel the need to make Batman and Robin plausible, why doso with the Phantom? <br /> <br />This aside the movie could have been much worse, the supporting roles were all done very well, including Minnie, and the movie looked and sounded great. I am basically picking nits, but to  me at least, they are rather large nits.  <br /> <br />
0743454537|1.0|Those of us rating this book 1 star (or less) are in the vast minority.  Take some time and view the reviews by lowest rating first.  The title of my review says it all for me.  In an \\"interview\\" in my version, the author says she ended the book the way she did because \\"this isn't an easy book ... and there are no easy answers.\\"  In my opinion, she chose the easiest answer of all.  After dangling different scenarios that a final choice might bring, she lets every single character off the hook in the end.  No one has to make a choice at all - \\"fate\\" does.  Bull!  In real life, a real choice would have to be made.  The whole book is about making a very tough decision.  Then poof! Golly gee, here's the big whammo twist ending, make sure you cry now!  But no one has to decide. That's the cop out.   <br /> <br />I agree with other extremely well-written reviews that the popping from character to character is too much and confusing.  The author has a point-of-view problem.  Worse, the emotions come from a dictionary with as much depth.  Did we cover it all?  A is for anger, B is for bitterness, C is for confusion. . . I knew I was being manipulated. <br /> <br />I began to skim, a bad sign, tired of the tediousness of it all and supremely irritated at those points I was supposed to stop and gasp about what a great analogy/metaphor/poignant point the author was making.  Don't make me aware you're writing - sweep me along. <br /> <br />I had to read this because I am part of a book group.  Otherwise, I'd have thrown it in the trash early, and I never do that to books.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|I really can't wait to get this Nov 15th...alll 10 seasons for 200 dollars.  That's 20 bucks a season.  $200.00 is pretty cheap considering this show has so many priceless, memorable episodes.  It's worth every penny.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I was so nervous for Joss's movie.  I wanted to be entertained as he has done for me over the last 7 years at least.  He exceeded my expections and I was thrilled to be entertained with Serenity's action, off the wall comments, heroism, and suspense.  I congratulate all involved with Serenity's production.  May this movie bring out a new group of Science Fiction enthusiasts to see it and raise the stakes for more new scripts in movies of Joss's great quality.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched this when it was on the air--much to my chagrin. I meant to--being all in love with the Joss-verse of Buffy & Angel. I bought the DVD's used for a friend for her b-day. She squeed a lot! As the movie Serenity was about to debut, I borrowed her set so I could go to the film with her. By episode 2 I was extremely ticked off that the series had been canceled. Firefly is unique, inventive, hysterically funny, & smart. I have since bought my own set of DVD's. Another friend has also recently \\"converted\\". Anyone who values wit & intelligence in their television viewing owes it to themselves to check out Firefly.  <br /> <br />Shiny.

B00005AQE8|5.0|great album from beginning to end i love every song except california love cos dre is in it and should have more 2pac in it, but apart from that 2pac easily shows his lyrical talent in his death row debut and the best double cd in hip hop history. <br />it's outstanding and if your a 2pac fan or hip hop fan but this now if you havent. <br />it's a classic G funk westcoast album with great production and lyrics has a few good featured artist some unknown but that doesn't matter cos 2pac is in it. <br />excellent work from the late Tupac Shakur rest in peace.
B00079FUI6|1.0|Why are Americans so obsest with this sort of crap? We are suppost to be better than this. All we ever care about is whoes right, sex, revenge, and who knows what. And is VERY annoying. Thats not what entertainment is. How could anyone be into that? It just sikends me.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|What can I say about Cream that hasn't been said?  For me, this is an emotional experience like no other.  The morning after a friend called to tell me that the DVD was soon to be released, I logged on to Amazon from my desk at work and had to fight back tears just SEEING it for myself.<br /><br />I have the DVD of the \\"Farewell Concert\\" from 1968 (the year I graduated high school, by the way) and I must say that this is much better.  The filming is excellent, and much more viewable than the Farewell Concert.  It's really like being in the front row.<br /><br />But more than anything, I hope that people who appreciate Cream will buy this DVD in order to hear some of the songs by Cream that so many younger fans simply DO NOT KNOW.<br /><br />The magic of this music is that it has appealed to so many generations.  As great as the big band & swing music of my father's generation was, it INFLUENCED, but did not have a direct  appeal to my generation of teenagers.  Yet, here is Cream receiving a standing ovation from kids the same age that I was when I heard Cream for the first time.  We've lost so many greats in their prime that it is wonderful just to still have these three masters with us.  It brings me tears of joy.

B000059T1E|5.0|A must have for any 'Traffic' fan's collection! The music arrangement is cleverly put together. A very fresh sound for it's time. Steve Winwood's voice and talent really show on this compilation. Traffic was considered, in the 1970's to be one of the 'Super Groups'. A well deserved title for such a talented group of young musicians.
B000AMF7BK|5.0|Takk means \\"thank you\\" in most Scandinavian languages.  After listening to Sigur Ros's new album, Takk..., they are the ones who should be thanked.    Takk... is without question what modern music can be.  Listening to this gives one the feeling of listening to the possibility of music on the edges; of what music can be in the future.  But Sigur Ros doesn't peer forward without understanding and internalizing important elements of their musical past.    Takk... incorporates lush orchestrations, chants, children's xylophones, soundtrack ambience, mesmerizing falsetto choruses, tape samples, Pink Floyd-ish musical sequences, old-time brass bands, and countless other influences.  I'll admit, I fell for a similar review of that caused me to buy an album by The String Cheese Incident only to find out it was pretentious, disjointed, and technically, not that great.  Not so with Sigur Ros.    In many ways, I react to Takk... as I would to a Mahler or a Bruckner symphony: awed and sometimes confused but always satisfied with the resolution at the end.  And they require repeated hearings to grasp all the sides.  But I'm just as comfortable with Otis Redding, Buddy Miller, Wynton Marsalis, and Steve Reich.  That seemingly impossible blending of the various styles and techniques being done so professionally is what people will appreciate about Sigur Ros.    Their music rests on a foundation of complexity and harmony that builds toward an ultimate simplicity and beauty.  This is not background music; it will draw you in and cause you to forget what you were working on.  And don't be retentive about needing to know about the lyrics, because there is no help here.  This is about the music.    It is modern and it is influenced by European roots.  So some won't like it, although I think many of them would respect it.  It may become one of your instant favorites.  If you're not crazy about it at first, you'll know enough to save it for a later day, because you might consider it oneof your favorites by then.
B00005N5RM|4.0|This 1988 re-make of the classic 50's horror film may have a few misfires here and there and it may look a bit dated, but it's a surprisingly good re-make which is quite a rarity.  Nightmare on Elm Street 3 director Chuck Russell, who would go on to direct the Mask and Eraser, is at the helm of this gross-out romp with Kevin Dillon starring as a teenage rebel outsider who allies himself with a cheerleader (Saw's Shawnee Smith) when a murderous, slimy, monster goes on a rampage through their small town.  The blood and gore effects are great for their time, while the effects of the Blob monster itself look a little dated.  Everything else about this re-make however is still better than you would expect, including some imaginitive deaths.  The cast also includes ER's Paul McCrane, and look for small roles featuring Baywatch babe Erika Eleniak and David Lynch regular and Eraserhead star Jack Nance as a hospital doctor.

0767830555|5.0|I know few films in which the main character lives in a bigger contradiction. \\"Taxi Driver\\" depicts Travis Bickle, a man who desperately wants to wipe out everyone around him as much as he wants to embrace them. The action takes place in the New York suburbs and is somewhat of an exercise in style that works just right from beginning to end.<br /><br />Hollywood has a history of interesting director-actor relationships of which the Scorsese/De Niro association is perhaps one of the most remarkable, starting with \\"Mean Streets\\", having its climax precisely with \\"Taxi Driver\\" only three years later and going on through \\"Raging Bull\\", \\"Goodfellas\\", \\"Cape Fear\\" and \\"Casino\\". Looking at these titles, you get my point when I say it is a remarkable association, don't you?<br /><br />\\"Taxi Driver\\" is arguably the pinnacle in Scorsese's career, too. It's hard to make such claim for such a talented and fruitful director, but this movie is that good. It works on so many levels and is so real and down to earth that every bit of action strikes you really hard and a lot of it you can actually relate to.<br /><br />In one of the most famous scenes ever, Travis says: \\"You talkin' to me? Well, I'm the only one here.\\" And that was too true. He really was alone.
B00005R1N3|3.0|I saw this movie on cable 10 years ago and when I saw it, it was called Silent Night Deadly Night. I can't tell you how many times I searched for this movie in bad video stores, online, etc. and kept coming up only with that Santa Claus slasher film. Finding out it was actually called Black Christmas and getting it on Amazon was thrilling but on second viewing all these years later, I have to say I was disappointed. I didn't recall knowing the killer was living in the attic so soon in the film and would have found it much scarier not to know where he was exactly until the very last scene. The obscene phonecalls are GREAT and CHILLING but confusing as his words are sometimes inaudible. I would have liked to have seen a lot more of these phonecalls and less about that annoying house mother. What I really do like about this film in retrospect, is that you never see the killer, never learn anything about him or his motives and all you're left with is knowing that a very insane, very psychotic monster with a mother complex and affection for animal noises will live in this attic a long, long time and will cause a lot more mayhem long after the credits have rolled. Good film but not a lot different than everything we've been watching for the past 20 years.
B00030590I|5.0|Hero is a thrilling and deeply moving viewing experience. The Martial arts scenes are visually stunning, very unusual and beautiful. Surprisingly little explicit violence, this is about dance and spectacle. Backgrounds and settings are used to great effect, and the use of color is quite notable. The acting is nuanced and effective. The plot is quite intricate and involved, but still relatively east to follow. Several surprising plot twists. The ending is not completely satisfactory, but this is a movie to make you think---about ethical-political issues such as the justifications for war and revenge. Worth seeing more than once.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|You know, let me be the first to say that I love 'Dune', the books, the films, the mini-series.  I'd buy this in a minute ... if I had the option. <br /> <br />For not getting their collective act together and settling whatever issue is holding this damn thing up, I'd like to stand up and give Universal the finger.  I've waiting long enough.  The thing that REALLY gets under my skin is that Universal has also recalled all the copies of the original cut too.  So right now, there's no edition of this film available at all. <br /> <br />I'm also fed up to no end with Universal's penchant for double-dipping \\"Special Editions\\" of their film library.  How many re-issues of 'Jaws' has there been? 4?  With every edition basically having the same lame extras that I've seen ad nausem?  Universal has shown fans that added value is meaningless to them. <br /> <br />There's no excuse for this to be held up until the end of January (the last current release date that I had).  Universal has all the material they need ... GET IT DONE ALREADY!!!
0451452739|5.0|I first read this book about 20 years ago.  It was the reason I became a Sci-Fi fan.  The conflicted HAL computer system, the mysterious monolith, and gripping storyline towards the end (I won't ruin it for you), make this a great addition to your library.  I reread it in 2001 when I bought the hardcover edition.  Highly recommended!
B0002EXH54|4.0|I would say 4/5 just because the mixes at the end...how are they different from the originals? All i got out of them is a hollower sounding song and a bunch of ruined solos. OK not ruined. Below Megadeth's standards sounding solos. Wake Up Dead is a great opener, The Conjuring (one of my favorites) following it. Ahhhh the famed Peace Sells at number 3. Trust me this cd pays for itself as soon as you pop it in and switch it to Peace Sells. The opening bass riff and the screeching first solo (among others). Devil's Island is a heavier power song. Good Mourning/Black Friday is my personal favorite on this cd, with its eerie first two minutes, and then the speedy, kill everything in sight sound, which is also the case for the lyrics. Bad Omen is up next, and i can't say it kept my interst long. I usually skip it. Not that its not a good song, it just isn't very exciting. Maybe if they had put it farther from GM/BF it would have been better, it just doesn't seem to fit to me. I ain't superstitous is a catchy but not at all apetizing song in my opinion. Its too catchy to skip once it gets going but i really don't enjoy it. It has grown on me somewhat though. My Last Words is another really good song. It is fast throughout, and explodes at the end. As I've said before, the remixed tracks are pointless. I would recommend this to all thrash fans, especially if they lik eother Megadeth. This is a great must have album.
B00003CXC7|5.0|\\"Rear Window\\" (alongside \\"Psycho\\") is universally regarded as Hitchcock's masterpiece and perhaps rightly so. There's something unique about this film which becomes harder to recreate as the years go by and we are hit left and right with silly special effects.<br /><br />So what is cinema but the opportunity it gives us to look into other people's lives? That is, by definition, in some way or another, true for most films. \\"Rear Window\\" takes that premise to the extreme. Well, if you live in the 50s, have just broken a leg and your place happens to have a big window through which you can spy on your entire neighborhood, there's not much else you can do, is there?<br /><br />At least that's what Jeffrey (again, magnificiently played by James Stewart) thinks, even more so when he becomes convinced that one of his neighbors (Raymond Burr, of \\"Perry Mason\\" fame) has killed the wife. The trick here is that Hitchcock places us right next to Jeffrey the whole time. We get no more information than he has and we are kept guessing all the way through.<br /><br />The plot only gets thicker as it goes along and fortunately for him Jeffrey can share his concerns with his girlfriend Lisa (played by the beautiful Grace Kelly) and his maid, who helps him with the house duties in his time of need. Obviously both of the women grow increasingly worried with the proceedings, with Lisa even managing to get herself in danger on a desperate attempt to solve the big mystery.<br /><br />I have trouble thinking of a genre that has more power to keep the viewer on the edge of his seat. But as with everything, it has to be done right. Can you think of a better director for the job, though?
B000068IEU|2.0|Okay, this is an incredibly cheesy, low-budget film which doesn't have very many redeeming qualities besides the fact that it has a very Helter Skelter feel to it. As I was watching it, it occurred to me that Craven, consciously or unconsciously, was writing a documentary heavily inspired by the Manson family and murders. The callousness and frenzied acts of ruthless murder strike me as probably being very similar to the way the Manson murders went down. BUT the problems with this film are MANY. The base gore and violence, the lousy character development, the very obvious GOOD v. EVIL theme and the cheap attempts to \\"shock\\" the audience take so much away from its integrity for it ever to be considered a great horror film. The writers/directors seem to have not been able to decide what kind of movie they wanted to make: a horror film, a spoof of a horror film, a snuff film, a slapstick comedy or a porno. Since they couldn't decide which way they were going, they just threw all of those elements in, in an extremely haphazard way. Tactics such as graphic rape, forced urination, disembowling, oral removal of sexual organs etc., are so forced, it is just so obvious that the directors were simply intending to push the barriers of film making and say \\"@#$% the rules\\". Throwing conventionality to the wind is a great thing for film makers but at the same time, the director/writers seem to be enjoying this agony a little too much to believe they were simply showing the reality of modern violence without glorifying it quite a bit. Be prepared to shower after you watch this film and don't expect to be able to enjoy food for a long time.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|My wife and I loved this film when we saw it last year during the holiday season. We saw the film in 3-D, which added to its fun and charm.  I'd love to own a copy of it; but, even more, I'd really love to own a 3-D version.  Any chance of that happening?  Then my 4-star rating would be 5 stars.
6301744136|4.0|'Saturday Night Fever' (1977) will probably always be director John Badham's most famous movie. My personal favorite will probably always be his 'Dracula' (1979). But his 'Short Circuit' (1986) is top notch as well. On the surface it may look like a silly movie about a robot that comes to life when it is struck by lightning. But as in his 'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Dracula,' Director John Badham takes the movie to a much deeper level than we expected. The robot (# 5) was originally built for the purpose of killing, and when he comes to life, he can not accept that. While # 5 is undoubtedly the star of this movie, there is an excellent supporting cast. Stephanie is wonderful as the benevolent woman who by chance crosses his path and  accidentally becomes responsible for # 5's most famous line: 'NO DISASSEMBLE!' Newton does a good job of the scientist who can not (at least for awhile) bring himself to believe what we as the audience have seen. Ben is hilarious as the Indian who works with Newton. (I.E. When # 5 gets angry and the driver of the truck asks what to do, Ben replies: 'I don't know about you, but I am planning to scream and run.') Howard is memorable as the scientist who has started to become more concerned with business, but his former values of science start to reemerge. What makes this movie so wonderful is that while it is filled with suspense and comedy, it also offers important questions and issues. (How far will science go to kill people? Should important scientific values start giving way to business? Is it easier to destroy than to analyze? We are always looking for new life, but when we find it will we be likely to destroy it?) This is an excellent movie that not only maintains it comical tones, but it offers us suspense and some things to think about. This is certainly worth giving a chance to. If you like this, be sure to check out John Badham's 'Saturday Night Fever'(1977) and 'Dracula' (1979). Thanks again for the great finished product John!
B000AJJNOK|5.0|50 has taken us from \\"Gangsta\\" rap to a more conventional form of rap, but all the while leaving the \\"hype\\" of living a rich lifestyle and being a \\"gangsta\\"....I was in Germany when I heard Candy Shop for the first time and saw the video on MTV...and just about DIED....thinking to myself \\"What a great song\\" not to mention that the video was outstanding...in Europe they don't edit what you are watching so you got to see the video in it's entirety and hear the music the way that it was made without all the blurps when he uses a few curse words... this CD shows us how 50 is growing and learing to leave his music a little less \\"gangsta\\" and a little less \\"vulgar\\" so that we can enjoy it on the radio as well as on CD...Thank you 50 so much for your musical talents keep on making the great music!!!
B000050FEN|5.0|Boy, what can I say about this film that hasn't been said yet? In my eyes, it is easily the best psychopath movie I've ever seen. But that alone seems a little gratuitious, doesn't it? So let's be a little more specific.<br /><br />The tone of the film is perfect all the way through. Shot in a noir style, David Fincher (\\"The Game\\", \\"Fight Club\\") managed to get the mood just right: bleak, tragic, dark, wet and crazy. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are two detectives hot on the trail of a crazed psychopath (or so they think) who happens to get off by making ordinary people an example of each of the seven deadly sins.<br /><br />What starts to be a regular psycho film, becomes totally out of the ordinary halfway through when the detectives become aware that it is not your average-run-of-the-mill psychopath they are dealing with. Just when they think they are about to screw him, it's him who's screwing them. And that's one of the remarkable beauties of this film which makes it quite unique in its genre.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is one of those actors whose screen presence emanates such class that he can aswell just sit around looking pretty. In \\"Se7en\\", there's a scene where Spacey engages in a supreme dialogue with Pitt and Freeman through the security division of a police car on the way to a particularly important location. This scene is for many reasons the centerpoint of the movie and Spacey's performance is so convincing that at some point you begin to question the atrocity of his previous deeds and whether there's actually some truth in his arguments. Few actors could play this as well as Spacey but he totally nails it.<br /><br />Take a brilliant director and three superb actors, all of whom can't put out a bad performance for the life of them. Add amazing cinematography and a top-notch, virtually flawless thriller script. What you get is one of the best films of the decade and a landmark in the career of everyone involved.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|Having been a long time Cream fan, I was both excited and apprehensive about this reunion and the subsequent release of the DVD. Most of my apprehension dissapeared after watching these guys perform. True to some reviews, the explosiveness of the band 37 years ago is long gone. But it is replaced by very sturdy playing by seasoned vets who are masters of their craft. I dont know how anyone would compare them to who they were almost 40 years ago anyway. Im sure none of us have the youthful energy of long ago. The real star here is Clapton. He is on top of his game for these shows.It is great to hear him as an only guitarist again. No watered down studio efforts or big bands to drown out his god given talent. His solo on Stormy Monday is earthshaking. He really steps into it. Phenomenal playing. Jack Bruce although looking worse for wear, lays down some tremendous bottom end. His voice is surely not what it was, but in no way is it bad. Ginger, while not the thunderous drummer of yesteryear, keeps perfect timing, and explodes on Toad.The reason only 4 stars were given here has nothing to do with the bands playing, its in the song selection. Why on earth was Tales of brave ulysees and strange brew left off in favor of pressed rat and a weak NSU were beyond me. Those songs were perfomed every night and they should have been included. The DVD is stellar in its sound and cinematogrophy.All in all, everything a real cream fan could expect from the reunion and DVD. ps. Lucky enough to score tickets to the Garden for Oct.25 and am psyched.
B0000024UF|5.0|This album came into my life mysteriously .  I don't where it came from, who gave it to me, or when I started listening to it, but somehow in a box of my tapes was a black, plastic, coverless cassette of \\"Songs From A Room.\\"<br /><br />I kept it in my car, played it over and over and over again--for years--and then, just as oddly as it had come into my life, I left it on the dashboard of my car on a hot day, and it softened and melted into a warped, unplayable curl.<br /><br />A[...]<br /><br />That was a temporary tragedy for me.  The songs on this album are stripped-down simple--usually only bass, guitar, jew's harp, and Leonard's sinister vocals--but the sere background only emphasizes the otherworldlyness and the beauty of the lyrics.  Leonard Cohen is a poet, and the songs on this album are poetry.<br /><br />\\"Like a bird on the wire<br /><br />Like a drunk in a midnight choir<br /><br />I have tried<br /><br />In my way<br /><br />To be free.\\"<br /><br />Or:<br /><br />\\"Sometimes I find myself<br /><br />Thinking of the past<br /><br />And how we swore to each other<br /><br />Our love would surely last.<br /><br />You kept right on loving,<br /><br />I went on a fast.<br /><br />Now I am too thin<br /><br />And your love is too vast.\\"<br /><br />These songs are beautiful, mysterious, and haunting.  This album is cohesive and a thing in itself: the way the album starts and end with a blip, and the feel of all the songs when next to each other.  ...Songs made of words and pain and sorrow and love and the emptiness after something good has ended.  ...Songs that drift into your life and then melt away and that never ever truly leave you.

B00003CXA3|2.0|What was really the big deal about this movie? Sure, it has 2 of my favorite actors in the cast [Gene Hackman And Roy Scheider] but, The movie is quite slow-moving and quite slow-paced for an action film. Here's the story: Two new york cops [Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider] go after a french drug dealer [Fernando Rey] and his cartel who're shipping drugs into New York from France. Two things save this movie: Gene Hackman's performance as Popeye Doyle and The awesome car/train chase [Which really is probably the only reason to watch this movie]. If it only had more action, This movie could've possibly been a true winner in my mind. But, they chose to take it slow and it's almost a shame that this movie is called an action movie when in fact, There is barely any action in this movie at all. It's true that this movie is based on a true story. Matter of fact, There was a book about the real-life events of this movie [Which had the same title]. Don't get misleaded by the fact that this movie is in the action section, If you're looking for a movie with awesome action scenes, This is not the movie you're looking for. Want a good old-school Action cop movie? Go rent ''Dirty Harry'' instead. Followed by a sequel [Which is entirely fictional, By the way]. Hope my review helped. Be blessed, Have a nice day.

B0002XDODU|5.0|Reise, Reise <br />Rammstein's fourth studio album <br />2004 <br /> <br />If you liked Rammstein before giving \\"Reise, Reise\\" a listen, you'll like Rammstein after giving \\"Reise, Reise\\" a listen. A band like Rammstein could never really change that much. \\"R, R\\" has the same ethereal synth melodies, crushing guitar lines and deep-throated vocals that made \\"Sehnsucht\\" and \\"Mutter\\" iconic among German metal albums. What is actually different on \\"R, R\\" is the lyrics, which have really started to display real thought. Of course, there's plenty here for fans of the older material, as the band still displays their love of the perverse (Mein Teil [My Part]) and the nonsensical (Keine Lust [Don't Feel like It]). But for once, the band is caught displaying actual emotion with songs like Ohne Dich [Without You] and Amour [Love]. On the flip side, the band is shifting their attentions to political (Amerika) and social (Moskau) lyrical themes as well. <br />People who fell in love with songs like Zwitter, Heirate Mich, Du Hast and Du Riechst So Gut may not be so enamored of the themes of Rammstein's latest outing, but the band is opening up their horizons for a much more interesting series of albums to come (and how long could they write albums purely about sex and death anyway?). If you want to see Rammstein diversify, or don't speak any German and just like the sound, pick up \\"Reise, Reise.\\"
B00006J3WH|5.0|To come up with half the episodes they did for Buffy boggles me.  Hey, let's not talk for one and then one episode we'll do all music.  To some one that has not seen Buffy, they would think the episode ideas were dumb, but no they're awesome.  The album just reassures that.  I'm sure you can imagine what kind of looks I get when my wife walks in the door and I am jamming to the cd, but hey it's worth it.  This album is great.
B0000009XP|5.0|Imagine being in a London nightclub in 1966, when an unknown man with a guitar named Jimi Hendrix climbs onstage from the audience. He plugs in his instrument and begins to play with the headliners - Eric Clapton and Cream. Minutes later he's gone, leaving the musicians, critics, and the audience gaping in awe. From that moment forward, everyone who witnessed this spectacle knew that rock guitar playing had been forever changed.  Hearing Buddy Guy for the first time can be equally momentous. Buddy and Jimi heavily influenced each other, and the results speak for themselves. When Buddy's at his best, as he is on Stone Crazy, practically no one can stand toe-to-toe with him without getting burned or schooled. His self-taught mastery, unbridled creativity, and berserk ferocity on the electric guitar make lesser players seem impotent by comparison. <br /> <br />George \\"Buddy\\" Guy had been working professionally as a musician for more than two decades when he recorded this album. But, it was his performance on Stone Crazy that firmly established him among the pantheon of electric guitar gods in the minds of rock aficionados. His playing on this album undulates sensually, laughing, crying, sighing, teasing like a faint tickle one moment, and then thrusting like an ice pick in the gut without warning. Plainly speaking, listening to this CD is like having  hoalistic sex with reckless abondon - passive participation is simply impossible.  <br /> <br />As he nears seventy, the flashes of brilliance and moments of astonishing prowess on the guitar are now fewer and farther between. But on a good night, he can still let loose a jaw-dropping, blistering solo that will sonically assault your senses.   <br /> <br />If you like Stone Crazy, I'd also recommend his 2001 release, Sweet Tea. While it lacks the guitar pyrotechnics of Stone Crazy, this album cooks with a slow burn like Mississippi mulligan stew. On one incredible tune, Baby Please Don't Leave Me, Buddy conjures up some fuzz-tone mojo with reverb that would make the Voodoo Chile himself shiver in his grave. <br />
B0000DIXDR|5.0|K where do i begin. The begining theme song was horible. I thought that the guy that was singing the song was being tortured by rebals. But besides that crap it was fairly good. I mean any movie with my main man Patrick has got to be good. But that one lady that is like like 11 and is named Baby, she is like a big minus. Ok she lugs watermelons around as a hobbie. Then she like trys to be cool by danceing in a dark coner by herself. Then Patrick kidnaps here and leaves here in a forest in the rain. GOOD JOB PAT. With her out of the way he's the star. Oh i forgot to mention that weird lady who likes to turn off the lights and hide in kitchens. I also think she remained there for the rest of the movie hideing. But the reason i gave 5 dirty dance moves out of 5 is because of Pat.
B00004XPPE|5.0|The fact that there's a rare cameo here from the 50's American fashion model elite, Nancy Berg (of NBC Count Sheep fame) already earns it an easy 5 stars.  But Henry Fonda's perpetual presidential roles, at its height here, combined with a superb cast and an eerie opening scene makes this a prodigious work of art that continues to be pertinent to this day.  One can't help but hypothetically \\"plugging\\" recent presidents into similar situations and wondering how they would have acted.  That's when the suspense plot of Fail-Safe becomes a true horrorshow that surpasses anything Stanley Kubrick can come up with.
B0002CR0GS|1.0|Genre: Religious Exploitation Flick    This is one of the most unrelentingly grueome movies ever made.  Mel thinks if he can shock, disgust, and disturb you with hideously graphic depictions of unimaginable brutality and extreme suffering, you'll feel so horrible, you'll accept Jesus as your savior.  It's not reason, it's not eloquence.  It's exploitation.
B000A88F22|5.0|This DVD is for TRUE Britney fans only! Not people who don't like her. Thats why I dont know why so many people are hateing on here. The CD is great!! I have wanted these songs for a while and it was worth the wait. I love the POP/ Dance beats to the songs Chaotic and Mona Lisa, and the Ballad Someday is like Everytime! I love it!!! The DVD is also fun to watch. I am glad this came out on DVD. I recorded the season, but now I have it on DVD with extras! Britney and Kevin are soo cute together. This DVD shows how their relationship blossomed! Thanks Jive for putting out this DVD and again, to the Haters out there: Dont you have anything better to do then write bad reviews about Britney? Guess not. Losers!

B000050X31|2.0|This production seems to illustrate the problem of mainstream opera today. I'm no expert on music so I'll talk mainly about the staging. I guess big opera houses like the Met have the need to preserve the honorable tradition of Opera, which means taking the piece and themselves utterly seriously, and thats how it looks - like a museum. And when you apply this approach to the Zauberflotte the result is boring at best and embarassing at worst. I mean, how can you take this story seriously today ? It can yield a great Opera performance mainly because of the potential to have fun with it and make fun of it.  <br />The cast, for the most part, is very dull. Especially Battle and Araiza as Tamino and Pamina, who are even more nerdier than their part demands.  <br />I was also disappointed by the stage design, done by the artist David Hockney. Although done very masterfully, it served as no more than pretty decoration. I had expected something more inspiring from such an artist.  <br />If you're going to dedicate a few hours to this opera, see the version directed by Ingmar Bergman. This production has found the golden path between respecting the classical piece and being able to have fun with it and contribute something to its history. Everyone plays and sings delightfully, even the stiffer characters, and Bergman manages to bring out the humanistic, life embracing message that is in Mozart's music. Plus, hearing the characters chatter between themselves in what sounds like every-day Swedish gives them a naturalness, turning them into real human beings - unlike the clumsy German with heavy Italian and American accents performed by the stars of the Met.
B0001NIUWG|1.0|I cannot understand why some of the other reviewers gave more than 1 star to that crappy documentary. There is No queen music at all, and it's soooo soooo kitschy. A non-queen fan would start to laugh by watching freddie moving all the time like 'the number one fag' in the interface menus. It's not a representation of queen at all. Very poor and disapointing. Worst queen documentary ever. Don't buy it

B0007GAERG|4.0|Alright, this is why Mariah is the highest selling female artist of all time. Most of the songs on the album show versatility and show that she's a \\"real\\" person. A lot of these songs on these album I found myself being able to relate too. Hopefully, you will too.  <br /> <br />1. It's Like That - 1st single. Uptempo track. This song in my opinion is crunk! I love the beat to it. And the ending \\"Let's Go Now! Here we go now!\\" I think Fatman Scoop was the right incredient to make this a slamming hit. Also, J.D. always makes a great Mariah track.  <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together - 2nd single. What can I say? This song is incredible. Last I counted, It had been on the billboard charts for 12 weeks at #1 on the charts with one interruption from American Idol's Carrie Underwood. I love the passion and control she has for her voice on this song. You can really feel like she was once in love and misses that guy.  <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off - 3rd single. This is kind of like to all the people who hate on her. She just shakes them off because she's making big bucks and kinda doesn't care anymore. I like this song because why keep people around that aren't real!? JUST SHAKE EM OFF!  <br /> <br />4. Mine Again- Amazing. She shows her vocal strength  <br /> <br />5. Say Somethin' - This song took awhile to grow to me. The beat and everything is just so different. Overall, I like it now.  <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night - I don't really like this song as much as the first four tracks either but it's growing to me.  <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number - This is a hot song. I enjoy listening to it. It could be a potential single. Once again, J.D. lays it down how it is. He and Mariah work so well together on everything they do. Props to them <br /> <br />8. One And Only - I like this. It's kinda different and it features one of my favorite rappers Twista. It's 4/5 star because I felt like it could have been a little better.  <br /> <br />9. Circles - This took awhile to grow to me. I'm impressed with the vocals that she shows, though. Usually, she doesn't sing like this on her slow songs.  <br /> <br />10. Your Girl- I don't really like this one. I usually skip it <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew - It's okay! She should have put her song \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" right here instead of this. I don't know why that song didn't make the album because it sounds better than this.  <br /> <br />12. To The Floor- I like this. I love the beat and how Nelly and Mariah switch verse/course.  <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride - Beautifully sung. I think \\"Mine Again\\" has more potential to be a love song that could be a single though. <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird - Best song on the album. She proved why she's the best on this one. It's one of my favorite inspiration songs by her over the past years other than \\"Through The Rain\\".
0060825219|5.0|I love Paulo Coelho's writings.  I have read all of his books.  This one has stirred in me a desire to understand my life better, to live my life better.  I look at his writings as highly spiritual in nature and feel they meet you at where you are in your own personal journey.  This book in particular helped me to understand why I myself am feeling so uncomfortable in my own skin, I am longing for something \\"more.\\"  Esther is a character who I understand and relate to-the narrator reminds me that we all have further to go in our quest for self.  When Coelho writes, \\"I believe in signs.  I believe in fate. I believe that every single day people are offered the chance to make the best possible decision about everything they do...\\"  I realize how important that line is in each of our lives.  I want to CHOOSE and choose well.  Read this book and review your own life...   <br />WONDERFUL STORY!
B0008KLVDM|4.0|Despite the small screen, this blockbuster film translates well onto the PSP.  This is probably due to the sound processesing that you are able to hear when you use the PSP earbuds.  The sound provides a \\"big space\\" feel and you almost forget that you are watching this movie on a tiny screen.  I had not seen this title in  quite awhile and I had forgotten that some of the most iconic dialog was here, such as \\"Hasta la vista, baby.\\" Great stuff!
B000A6T1KE|4.0|I saw Nemesis 3 times opening day and hadn't seen it since until I watched it again today. And I must say it is a fine Star Trek movie, however it is not perfect.  <br /> <br />First the good. The anti-Picard Picard or Shinzon is an interesting premise of a character. I do feel that his character is initially interesting...the first few chats with Picard are good. However, when the action picks up between the Scimitar and The Enterprise E I feel their dialogue becomes stale, as well as the movie. This big battle easily could have been edited down. It seemed the Enterprise E was at 10% shields 10 seconds into the fight, yet the fight lasts for 30 minutes!!! They should have taken out some of the fighting and put in some of the great deleted scenes in this package. Mainly the Data and Picard talk, the Wesley scene(apparently he is serving on the Titan...who would have known?) and a couple of others that seemed like they would have fit nicely...especially the last one where we get to meet a new member of Captain Picard's crew. A much better way to end the movie with his last line.  <br /> <br />I haven't looked over many of the other special features but I'm sure they're informative and well put together like those on the other special editions. <br /> <br />Of course, I have a few gripes with the movie. The whole rape thing was pretty rediculous and pointless...nothing is really followed up on that or even why its happening. Then there's the whole ending where everyone could have lived if Picard just listened instead of ignoring one of his crew members comments. Very unPicard and just bad writing. Then there's stuff involving Romulus that could have been put to good use like what's happening with Spock's reunification efforts?  <br /> <br />If this is the last TNG movie...then I do have to say I am disappointed, as I know they could have went out better with some great conflict rather than this more or less good vs. evil cliched storyline. If you liked TNG the show, you'll like Nemesis but it isn't perfect as it definitely leaves you wishing for a more complex problem for the crew to solve.  <br /> <br />Hopefully Trek isn't dead. If anyone from Paramount is reading this...I say the best way for TNG to end is Picard/Federation vs. Section 31. The Prime Directive is what the Federation is based upon and that is exactly what is threatened by Section 31...it's the most appropriate way to go out. Throw in The Titan, Bashir and Ezri in a skirt and other cool stuff to get people in seats and you have a hit.
0553296981|5.0|The diary of Anne Frank is the most inspiring book I have ever read in my life, coming from a 13 year old girl who has been reading novels since she was 6. Anne Frank, no matter what anybody says, is the most real, true, teenager ever and will always be remembered. Her diary is an honest-to-goodness count of the horrible time period that she and her family and family's friends suffered through. The definitive edition is much more revealing, but the regular one is good too. I would have never given this book a chance unless I had had my eighth grade reading teacher, Donesa Walker, who inspired me to read this book. For anyone, male or female, who is having doubts about themselves or thinks there is not enough goodness in the world, read this book and I guarantee you will think otherwise when finished. I am touched by her humor and therefore, God Bless Anne Frank, and God Bless everyone else, too.
0743454537|5.0|This is my third Jodi Picoult book, and her particular genius seems to be for writing beautifully phrased fiction incorporating fascinating detail. This novel, in particular, gives the reader some interesting insights into the medical and legal worlds, and introduces some very controversial food for thought. Her characters are true, and they feel like old friends by the last page. I can easily see why so many reviewers have complained about the book's ending, but I think it was a brave choice: the author must've known she'd be accused of taking an easy way out. Personally, I cried, but I kinda liked the jolt.  <br />This family and their many trials will capture your heart- I highly recommend My Sister's Keeper!
B00079HZUM|5.0|Comparisons between \\"Stage Beauty\\" and \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" are inevitable, but this 2004 film does not suffer much by the contrast to that Oscar winner for Best Picture.  Both films deal with the conventions of the English stage that dictated the roles of women be played by men and while both have a woman who wants to play a woman's role, this one has a man who wants to play only women's roles.  Both films conclude with a live performance in which the focal character ends up playing the opposite of their original roles.  Both films are intricately involved with the Shakespeare plays being performed to such an extent that it goes beyond life imitating art.  But whereas \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" was about writing and love, \\"Stage Beauty\\" is about acting and love, and I think it is ultimately more about its primary artistic focus than about romance.<br /><br />When it comes to performing the classical plays of Shakespeare or the tragedies of the ancient Greeks, I believe in realistic (nee naturalistic) acting rather than following the acting conventions of those periods in contemporary performances.  I enjoy those conventions, but I also think that if you can break the poetic constraints of the dialogue you can make those texts come alive for contemporary audiences.  So one of the reasons \\"Stage Beauty\\" resonates so strong for me is that it not only endorses but also celebrates the idea that such realism can have much more of a profound impact on an audience that those historically accurate sytlistic conventions.<br /><br />Half the inspiration for the original play \\"Compleat Female Stage Beauty\\" was when playwright Jeffrey Hatcher came across an entry in the diary of Samuel Pepys (Hugh Bonneville) that the actor Ned Kynaston was the most beautiful woman in the house when he was portraying one upon the stage.  The other half was the decision of Charles II (Rupert Everett) to not only revoke the prohibition of women acting on stage, but to declare instead that henceforth only women would play female roles on the English stage.  Thus we have the story of the most famous female impersonator of his day suddenly thrust into a world where he is no longer allowed to do what he does best.<br /><br />Billy Crudup plays Kynaston and his success as a woman on stage hinges in part on the acting conventions of the time.  He has studied the affected mannerisms demanded of the women characters on stage and if you would fault Kynaston's portrayal as Desdemona you can level the same charges against the Othello being played by Betterton (Tom Wilkinson).  This is simply what acting was during the Stuart Restoration.  Pointedly, a pair of women with aspirations towards acting on the stage doom Kynaston's career, one being his dresser, Maria (Claire Danes), who has memorized each inflection and gesture of his Desdemona and performed it in a tavern (which is technically not a theater).  The other is Nell Gwynn (Zoe Tapper), the king's mistress, who has more than the king's ear when it comes to persuading him to change the way things are in the theaters of London.<br /><br />There is, as you would suspect, some sexual tension between Maria and Kynaston, although it is more ardent on her part for most of the story.  She loves him, but he loves acting.  His argument against women playing women is that there is no \\"trick\\" to it.  I was going to say that he means no skill to such performances, but he really does mean trick.  Kyanston has studied his craft and literally suffered as his training stripped him of every aspect of acting masculine.  He has the trick of creating the illusion of a perfect woman (for example, the five positions of feminine subjugation), without the skill of acting the part, and he is offended by the very idea that being born a woman would give Maria or any other woman any advantage in doing so.  It is only when Maria and Kynaston discuss the tricks of being a woman versus being a man, after his life has been taken away from him, thathe not only sees her as a woman but begins to see himself as a man.  For her the key is her admission that she has never been able to do his Desdemona, not because it is mimicry, but because she disagrees vehemently with his premise that the character would not fight back when Othello murders her in her bed chamber.<br /><br />This all sets up the grand finale and for me the last act of \\"Stage Beauty\\" when we get to the rehearsal and performance of the play is totally captivating.  In one of the DVD features director Richard Eyre (\\"Iris\\") describes what we are seeing as the birth of naturalistic acting, which is exactly why I was so absorbed and why I know that those who have acted or directed actors, will respond to those scenes and this movie in different ways from those whose vantage point has always been as members of the audience.  Danes shows flashes of brilliance which we have not seen from her since her death scene in \\"Little Women.\\"  But Crudup gets special mention here, not only because his role is the pivotal one in the story and because he gets to play both Desdemona and Othello, but because his character is put through the wringer and has to evince two different styles of acting.an but begins to see himself as a man.

0060825219|5.0|Not as simple as The Alchemist, but it certainly is an excellent piece of work. It may not be very high on content. One has to notice subtle messages throughout the book    The conversation between \\"The author's wife\\" and the Old man in steppes is the heart of the book. It actually explains what the author means by Energy/Power of Love.     One needs patience to read the book as the author talks about the energy of love,the Zahir,etc. all the time but what it acutally means becomes clear only in the later stages of the book.    Excellent work!

B00005JNZP|4.0|On very rare occasions, it's a good idea not to follow the book.<br /><br />Jonathan Safran Foer's cult novel \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" has a wild chronology, and the journey is sprinkled with magical realism and countless flashbacks to minor characters. It COULD be crammed into a film, but it would not be a very accessible one. In fact, it might be almost unwatchable.<br /><br />Enter actor Liev Schreiber, who chopped out much of the backstory and focused on the \\"road movie in the Ukraine\\" storyline. No, it's not like the book. But taken on its own, \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" is a a striking, humorous and poignant film. Schreiber should be proud.<br /><br />Jonathan (Elijah Wood) has a funny fixation about remembering the past, which includes putting life souvenirs in plastic baggies. So his curiosity is piqued when his grandmother tells him of Augustina, a woman who rescued his grandfather during World War II. With only a ring and a photo to guide him, Jonathan travels to the Ukraine to find Augustine.<br /><br />He's met at the station by Alex (Eugene Hutz), a hip-hop tour guide who speaks his own peculiar dialect, Alex's weird, melancholy grandad (Stephen Samudovsky), and grandad's \\"seeing eye b*tch.\\" As they search the Ukraine for Augustine, if she is still alive, Jonathan begins to learn about the ways the past infringes on the present -- and a bit about himself as well.<br /><br />Schreiber apparently decided to adapt \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" when he began to chronicle his own family history, and discovered that it was strikingly similar to Foer's novel. For a beloved cult novel, editing and reshaping is a risky business. But in Schreiber's case, it becomes a whole different animal -- it retains the spirit of the original, if not the sense of history.<br /><br />While this is Liev Schreiber's directorial debut, it doesn't feel like one. Instead, it feels polished and experienced, with beautiful cinematography that ranges from night skies to a field of dazzling sunflowers. And his script has pathos and anguish, but also plenty of humour (most of it provided by Hutz), such as the scene where he tries to figure out what a vegetarian is, prompting Wood to tell him firmly \\"No meat!\\" (only to have both men ask what's wrong with him).<br /><br />Elijah Wood gives a remarkably subtle performance as a quiet, slightly neurotic young man who seems to be searching for something in the past to make him complete. Hutz balances him out with the colourful, slightly wonky Alex. He's both comic relief and a sort of wiser older brother for Jonathan. The plot revolves around these two, and they are balanced out well.<br /><br />Okay, it's not the book. But then again, it really doesn't pretend to be. Instead, Liev Schreiber's \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" is a bittersweet comedy that will leave you with a smile.a field of dazzling sunflowers.

B000AXSN5G|5.0|The first time I listened to the album, I enjoyed the basic sound. By the fourth time, after reading the lyrics, the album is one of his best. And that's saying something when you consider the Harvest albums, the Buffalo Springfied albums, CSNY, and Crazy Horse.    I have not read much at all about the song, It's a Dream, but it's a standout, where Young creates wonderful images then calls the image a dream and says, \\"It's a dream, it's only a dream, and it's fading now . . .\\" illustrating the surreal nature of life and life passing. I cried the fourth time I listened (first time really listening) to Hear for You, essentially, a letter from a  deceased parent for a child with the message, in other words,  \\"I let you go when the time came, but now you must let go of me so that you may move forward with your life. But if you need me, look for my spirit.\\" This album definately carries Young's spirit but may be a bit too serious or reflective for an audience below, let's say, 21.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|It's long, epic, pretentious, it contains songs that are fifteen minutes long. One is even over thirty minutes long. It contains long passages of ambient noise. It's also the most mind blowing album of the year. What we have hear is that rare album that is made for listening. Not while driving in your car, not in the background. While sitting in a darkened room in front of the speakers or with headphones on. This is not an album made of individual tracks where you pick your favorite and show your friends. The full effect of \\"Frances The Mute\\" is listening to it from beginning to end. An effect made even better with the title track not found on the album. You see during the recording of the album. There was a title track recorded. It has been referred to as the decoder track because it was suppose to help the album story make sense (it really doesn't). Because they already had seventy seven minutes worth of music and a CD can only contain 80 minutes of music it had to be removed. <br /> <br />The title track is a 15 minute epic. There has been speculation as to where its placement on the album would have been. Guitarist/Producer Omar A. Rodriguez Lopez has stated that its placement would have been at the beginning of the album. Listening to the track it's easy to see why. The beginning of the track doesn't link to any other song and the ending serves as an intro to \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus.\\" The song can be found on CD on \\"The Widow Single\\" or on vinyl as a 12\\" single. <br /> <br />The first album \\"De-Loused In The Comotorium\\" was and still is a great debut album. This album tops it. Buy the CD or do what I did and go with the triple vinyl and the decoder single. It's lock out grooves may be the coolest thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00008GKEG|5.0|I was born 1964 and didn't get a chance to know anything about the Beatles, These DVD's are a hudge piece of history that I never got to see. I loved it so much, lot's of music and stories, I deffintly got my money's worth, and you will too!
B0002EXH54|5.0|Okay...where do I start with this beauty, well, I should start by saying that this is a VERY close 2nd to RIP, and far ahead of 'Deths 3rd which is 'Youthanasia'. 'Peace Sells' is an essential metal classic for every headbanger everywhere, its here where they established themselves as one of the Four Horsemen of thrash (see also Metallica, Slayer, and Anthraz). And with great songs like 'Wake Up Dead', title track, 'Good Morning/Black Friday', and 'Bad Omen' why shouldn't they deserve that title? In fact the only below acerage song on this album is 'I Aint Superstitious', which is still a fair song. The line up in Peace Sells included Dave Mustaine as vocals, lyrics, and guitar. Dave was a decent lyricist by this time, as he gradually got better as time progressed, a poor vocalist (thats okay though, as the instruments are what attracted me to Megadeth) and an AMAZING guitarist. His riffs very complex, and solos INSANE (just listen to the second solo in 'Wake Up Dead'). David Ellefson played bass and backing vocals. Ellefsons basslines, especially in 'Bad Omen', were well above the average bass player, although he would continually get much better and by the time of RIP he was the best damn metal bassist on the planet (note** - this was after the tragic passing of the great Cliff Burton [RIP]). Chris Poland played guitar and backing vocals, and he was the 2nd best guitarist that Megadeth would ever have, he is beaten only by the godly Marty Friedman. Polands solos were UNREAL during this time, only Eddie Van Halen or his comember Dave Mustaine could do better than him. Gary \\"Gar\\" Samuelson played drums, and he was also one of the better 'Deth drummers, since his bass drums and snares were used at appropriate times, making the music downright INSANE! Dave Mustaine and Chris Poland could MURDER James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett (from Metallica) with ease! These guys meant business, and used many different guitar styles and went beyond the power chord unlike Metallica (which is why Master of Puppets was such a boring album). Nobody was better than Cliff Burton in terms of bass, but Ellefson proved that he wasn't far behind the late, great master. Lars Ulrich was an average drummer, thats it, and Gar could kick his ass on drums anyday. Hetfield was a much better vocalist than Dave at this time, and would be until finally in 2003 when he threw his good voice away with 'St. Anguish'. 'Deth is a far superior band to Metallica. They never made a bad album ('Risk' was poor, but not bad) while almost half of Metallicas albums were bad. They never sold out while Metallica sold out barely a decade into their musical career. They never SUED fans!   Song rating time:  Wake Up Dead - A+ (the whole song is amazing, epecially the solos)  The Conjouring - B (The verse riff made this song well above the norm, but the beginning was a little cliche)  Peace Sells - A+ (Dave Ellefson makes one of his best performances ever here, and Dave and Chris do well with solos and riffs. Plus Gars bass drum is wild here)  Devils Island - B- (I like the chorus nere, but the rest of the song seems below average for 'Deth)  Good Mourning/Black Friday - A+ (A complex balladic song erupts into a ferocious thrash metal assault, and the lyrics are insanely grotesque, but the solos are amazing in both parts)  Bad Omen - A+ (The intro is really cool, and Ellefsons crazy bassline not too far in is also a high point here. The end part Dave goes crazy with his voice and guitar [so does Chris])  I Aint Superstitious - D (This is the only below average song on the album. The lyrics are cliche, the guitars are as well, and its just too damn short)  My Last Words - A (This is a really cool song with a great instrumental beginning. The only problem here is the verse may seem cliche at times, although not really)    Overall: A+, B, A+, B-, A+/A, A+, D, A  No failing grades...thats good, I should have expected this from a great band like Megadeth.    **Note**: Master of Puppets byMetallica has two failing songs: Disposeable Heroes (almost got a D, but the lyrics didn't fit the instruments) and Damage Inc. (this one got a \\"Super\\" F).    PS: The remastering was great, I love the thought of Dave remastering an album to make it sound more crisp and clear, but the remixes at the end were kinda pointless. Sorry, but the album would still get a 5/5 without 'em.
B00001W9G0|2.0|Barbara Streisand plays a Communist Party activist named Katie who hangs portraits of Lenin and Stalin on her apartment wall. Robert Redford plays a talented writer named Hubbell who is less political. The story follows them from College, where they seem attracted to each other, to WWII, where they consummate their love and start shacking up together.<br /><br />After the War, they move to Hollywood and live the life of the haute bourgoisie. The makers of this film don't seem to think there is any contradiction with being both a Communist and being filthy rich, as Katie's strident political views never mellow.  She flies into deranged tirades every time someone makes a political joke of any kind, shrieking that \\"politics is serious!\\" While the makers of this film intended to portray Katie sympathetically, they failed miserably: She appears so psychotic that it is hard to believe Hubbell could have ever fallen for her. (He certainly didn't fall for her looks.)<br /><br />We are also supposed to sympathize with Hubbell, even though he waits until Katie is pregnant to dump her, and then apparently deserts mother and child completely.<br /><br />Perhaps the most bizarre part of the movie is in its portrayal of the attempts by HUAC to expose the rich Communists in Hollywood. As many of the couple's friends stand exposed, Streisand's character whines about the lack of civil liberties. My wife comes from a Communist country and her parents are Party members. She asked me, \\"How could a Communist with a portrait of Stalin on her wall complain about a lack of civil liberties?\\" I guess the people who made this movie thought that most viewers would be so unintelligent as to miss this grotesque contradiction. Based on the mostly positive reviews of this film, it sadly appears that they were right.
1573223026|3.0|A Long Way Down starts with the sort of implausible premise--four strangers meet while attempting to commit suicide from the same rooftop--that will make some readers groan at the start.  But the premise isn't the problem here; it's what comes afterward. <br />  The opening scene that brings all the characters together is like the book itself a mixed bag.  It reads at various times extremely funny, forced, glib, and worst of all, dull.  The characters themselves come from all walks of life--class, geography, religion, family relationships, but their voices are surprisingly uniform in this first scene and for too long afterward.  They eventually do sharpen and wander away from each other, but it takes a while.  One's reaction to them will probably depend as much on the reader's background/personality as on Hornby's skill in character creation.  I didn't find much to like in any of them, which certainly colored my reaction to the novel--I simply didn't care enough about any of the characters to overlook some of its flaws. <br />   The structure was also problematic for me.  Long Way Down is told from all four viewpoints but so many of the sections were too short or too glibly self-aware, robbing them of depth or power.  Settling in for some longer time with each of them would have helped. <br />   The plot sort of meanders from one ludicrous scene to another--some of them working, some of them not so much--an appropriate method for these characters (as is the way the book refuses to wrap things up nice and neat) but one that also robs the book somewhat of the ability to move a reader. <br />   Overall, the book fell flat for me--the plot never compelled, the characters never formed a strong hold on me, the themes were too shallowly explored, and the structure was more of an obstacle than an enhancement.  It's funny in many places, readable in most, but it doesn't go much beyond that.
B0002VEPS0|5.0|It's outstanding! I bought it for my dog and she enjoyed it enormously. The service and price were excellent. I bought this movie for my dog. My cat said it was childish and didn't like it. But my 4 year old dog loves it. She's watched it many times.
B000089RVX|5.0|this is probably the best overall cd i have ever heard. i listen to it constantly all day long ,my co workers are sick and tired of it. the songs are pervasive and haunting, it just sticks to your head. i wish the band could have stayed together. anyway, this will certainly last the test of time. Amy Lee you are the best!
B000AADYRQ|3.0|Finally a CD your mom will really love! Again the lyrics are excellent, but the lack of any tension and release really creates a disk that harkens back to those 70's male duo groups. Pray they don't cover \\"Love is the Answer\\" on the next one.

0345363132|5.0|This is the first Penman novel that I have read.  I had read the story on Richard III in 'Love and War', which sparked my interest in this subject, which led me to this novel.  This book was far superior to Love and War - Love and War was far too soppy and romantic, without enough historical detail - I knew when I was reading this book I had found my favorite author.  Was blown away by her detail on the War of the Roses. <br />  <br />Her take on the mystery of the princes in the tower was interesting.  However,  I do believe that he was responsible for their deaths - horrible as that was - that is the way they behaved back then - royalty that got in the way of other royalty gaining the throne were often executed openly or murdered in secrecy - as historians have stated, his bad reputation began during Henry VII's reign as a campaign to make Henry VII seem like a hero rather than a commoner who usurped the throne. <br /> <br />Perhaps, as other readers have stated, she come up with this theory of Richard being innocent for the Richard III society - as it is pretty far-fetched that he was innocent...way too much circumstantial evidence of his involvement and motives.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Very funny, songs that won't get out of your head, and a transfer that is to die for. You will love this movie if you like to smile!
B000063DHL|5.0|1986's Caught Somewhere in Time was the album of legends in creation, as Iron Maiden rose to the challenge in designing an album that was with synthesizer sounds for the first time ever. It was Pedal Synth technology and not real Keyboards like Roland and Yamaha, but the same Japanese giants of Technology that made the classic Keyboard  made that type of Synth Product, that was and still is the Pedal Synthesizer. Steve Harris is a genius when it comes to music and Bruce Dickinson is a master in shock vocals and performance, with the album being set with both things alongside the greatness of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith on dual Guitar; while Nicko Mick Brian is a fantastic drummer. Jazz took part in the Bass rifts and Rhythm rifts of the music as well as the Orchestration of the songs of Sea of Madness and Heaven Can Wait plus the Trilogy of Alexander the Great, although it is only one song, but it is the biography of his life. Caught Somewhere In Time is the Theme and it is a powerful song set in going back or forward in time, and Dej  Vu is a song that also does the same. Dej  Vu is a song that reminds me of the old Japanese Animae Cartoon Series' of the 1970s, in its sound style, and the same is with so many other songs on the album. This is indeed the finest album they did in the dawn of thier period where they began to bold themselves more and more.  The Album cover is graphic as Eddie is a Terminator like figure, who is also a sort of version of Blade Runner's main character, with him being a Cop and not an assasin. The City is influenced on that of Blade Runner, and it has many things involved with Iron Maiden's past up to that point.
B00000F14B|5.0|Truly a landmark American musical, it was obvious that the Music Man would make The journey from stage to screen. Ironically, it took about 13 years for Director Morton DaCosta to finally make it happen. It did however, benefit from the delay. That decade meant it could be filmed in a new TODD-AO widescreen process that was of course not available prior. And as anyone who has watched the film will tell you, much of the films beauty comes from its widescreen images. What many are not aware of is the fact that films shot in TODD-AO were not compatible with regular CinemaScope so each film was shot twice! If you were to watch The CinemaScope version next to The TODD-AO version you'd see two unique performances with different timing on edits as well as running time. The better quality transfer comes from The TODD-AO master but it seems the performances were a little better on The CinemaScope... No matter which process they used, the cameras incorporated were huge bulky things, which were a nuisance to move. This explains why much of this film uses static camera shots held on the image for long stretches of time. This affects the films pacing greatly and is one of the only signs of the films age.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|As a long time fan of the Eagles and having never seen them live in concert, I did not know what to expect from this farewell tour concert. As I began watching I found myself being pulled into the event. The collective and individual performances were brilliant. The video and audio was superb. The collection of songs was perfect; a blend of the old and the new. I enthusiastically recommend this DVD to any and all Eagles fans. It was pure joy.
B000AP04NI|5.0|This movie is a pure joy to behold. Nikki really makes the character of Tedd his own. The performances by all actors are second to none. In this day of Hollywood blockbusters bent on entertaining audiences with violence and nudity and vulgarity, it is so refreshing to see a movie with such a timeless and universal story. Oki makes life look so simple and wonderful. I give my highest recommendations to all people of all faiths to watch this movie.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|I like Avril's music. It's catchy and has the correct amount of guitars and drums for a minor rock-out for those of us not too keen on listening to guys yell and pout and scream the entire album. Compared to Let Go, the lyrics are a bit the same, but the melodies are more mature and darker than Let Go, but where Let Go was filled with possible radio hits, Under My Skin is harder to pin down. With each spin, I find myself discovering that I like one particular song, only to have myself discarding that one in favor of another. Because of this, Avril's fans from her first album may have a hard time listening to Under My Skin because it's less radio/single friendly. But ultimately, Under My Skin falls flat beneath Avril's still less than sophisticated songwriting and her juxtaposing image--is she a rebel with a message or is she just another teenage/young twentysomething woman writing about her bad ex-boyfriends? But it's a fair effort from Avril, and I do look forward to seeing her mature in her music.
B00011D1OA|5.0|Reviled by some, beloved by many, consistently referred to as the most popular movie musical ever made, MY FAIR LADY more than fulfills the promise of its beautiful visuals and expert song numbers on home video via DVD. This edition tops the 1995 laserdisc by allowing the sparkling, exemplary design of its 70mm. Todd-AO frame to be exhibited with increased sharpness and resolution. The 4.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack is powerful and clean, but since this film was originally mixed for six-track magnetic stereo, it's curious why the effort wasn't made by Fox to split the surrounds! Nonethless, the film sounds terrific. The extra features make this package a bargain at the price. Full length commentary by director George Cukor, with the musical numbers presented sans vocals, is a great touch. And the two documentaries are beautifully presented; full of facts and bits of arcane information that any fan will truly enjoy. A great movie, and a great DVD rendition. More like this, PLEASE!
B00005MP58|5.0|I have watched this movie every night since Michelmas.  And I expect I shall watch it for several fortnights more.  Truly the one thing I yearn for, at the end of the day, is to get good and sauced while watching Elizabeth Bennett.  Jennifer Ehle is pure Snow White.  If she had a porn site, I would try to find a hacked password for it, indeed I would.  I am excessively attentive to all those things.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|One of the most wonderful and happy films ever made. <br /> <br />Is not only a great musical, the story is really clever and full of wonderfull insights that deal with the process of making movies. <br /> <br />Deservely, one of the ten best films ever made!
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris has written a very readable book on the murky issue of faith and all that it entails. He shines the brilliant light of reason on the many questionable aspects of religious faith. He particulary takes Muslim faith to task because of the daily reminders we have of adherents willing to kill themselves, and many others, by simply following the directions in their particular guidebook, the Koran. He doesn't let other religions off the hook however, and points out the unquestioned madness that  has passed for faith through much of human history. I think his message may be muddied a bit by the discussion of conciousness and meditation towards the end of the book but this too is interesting in the context of faith. A higher plane of conciousness may already exist between our ears, quite peaceably...not in the texts of violent 5th Century diatribes, exhorting believers to kill anyone who does not agree with them.
0385338082|4.0|I remember bringing my book back into the bedroom (of which i shared, at the time, with 13 other people) and reading the book, everyone would just stare at me as i laughed and giggled my way through the whole book!! From the first page, Kinsella's narration will send you in spirals of laughter, (so maybe not best read on the tram!!) moving fluidly from her shopaholic series Kinsella takes on Emma's british, Bridget Jones-esque character to perfection.<br /><br />It starts off on a plane and during some turbulence she finds herself confiding her life secrets from clothing size (she really thought she was going to die to have to part with that!) to problems with her boyfriend and losing her virginity.<br /><br />The next day, striding into work (worst possible nightmare ever) the CEO of her company turns out to be Jack Harper, the very man she had clung to on the plane ride and confided her deepest darkest secrets to...including how she wags work to get a longer lunch hour and what she really thinks of her co-workers and the office's coffee machine!!<br /><br />There are never any dull moments in this fast packed and endearing novel, which although a bit unrealistic, we can, at times empathasize with our (size 8 I swear!!) heroine as we realize that she is but a complex charade of stereotypes.<br /><br />Now the question is: Can HE keep a secret?
038572179X|2.0|This is just the sort of book to read for that 20 minute ride on the subway each morning. The plot is moderately entertaining and there is some vivid, if at times bland and cliched, imagery.  <br />That being said, this book breaks no new ground and offers little food for thought. All the rave reviews that it received are testimonies to the abysmal state of contemporary fiction, if nothing else. That it is better than, say, \\"Lovely Bones\\" or \\"Life of Pi\\", is no achievement and does not make it truly worthwhile.  <br />\\"Atonement\\" is basically an above average piece of middle-brow fiction. The writing is often lazy, the metaphors and allegories are frequently misplaced, and there is little that lingers in the mind after one is finished with it. The potential for something truly intriguing that exists in the first 50 pages is quickly dissipated as the story turns melodramatic and overwrought - gruff yet valiant soldiers, loyal girlfriends, the horrors of war, etc, etc, etc.  <br />One thing that I found especially irritating was McEwan's need to situate his characters within the 1930s. The reader is constantly reminded, with references that are as gratuitous as they are obviously forced, to contemporary events and cultural trends (Hitler, the Ethiopian conflict, Virginia Woolf, Freud, women's liberation). In the process, the characters become one-dimensional types - the lefty Oxbridge radical, the \\"liberated\\" yet stifled female intellectual, the young girl re-defining fiction with painfully modernist prose (as if anyone at that age could have been writing anything else?!) Why must everybody in the book be a stand-in for the latest fad to have been sweeping Europe in the pre-war era? This is surely a failure of imagination on the author's part.
B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot is an awsome album. It shows Green Day's maturity as a band. It has a very clear message- Bush Sucks. This album has very good songs like Jesus Of Suburbia and Wake Me Up When September Ends. Another good one is Boulevard Of Broken Dreams. If you want a good cd to listen to you should buy this cd. Some people say that Green Day's older stuff was better, but don't listen. If you like the older stuff then listen to that but if you want something new buy American Idiot. Because in my opinion ALL their stuff is good. I have been listening to Green Day since the beginning and this album shows how far that they have come as a band. And the best part is that they are standing up for their beliefs and speaking thier minds about the tyrrant in office. This cd is well worth the money!
B00005JN0T|5.0|It's nice to see a film that is fun to watch and interesting.  This definately fits the bill
6300214826|4.0|'Apocalypse Now' is a movie that attempted to expressed somthing deep and profound, but ultimately failed in the end to express much of anything (at least in my opinion).  Francis Ford Coppola has said he was disappoined with the ending of this film.  It does not surprise me.  It seems like Coppola ran out of both gas and ideas by the time Martin Sheen's character meets Colonel Kurtz.  Coppola tried to make some sense or find something mystical in all the horror and confusion of war.  He did not succeed, and almost everything Colonel Kurtz says does not make any sense.<br />This does not mean the movie is bad or not worth watching.  In fact, the movie is awe-inspiring.  It is a surreal, nightmarish look at war.  A vision rarely unmatched by many other war movies.  Watch it with a group of people and see if it does not arouse dissenting opinions among them.  Some will love it, others will loathe it.  Very few will find it uninteresting.
B000001FQQ|1.0|Still trying to be a hip hair band in the mid eighties. Kiss really could not fit in their tights anymore as middle age crept up on them. The formula ran thin but their waistlines didn't! The music was horrible- they were trying to be the hair metal band that they never really were- pathetic. Gone were the great riffs, gone were the great harmonies and the subtle humor. They became a joke- Kiss - \\"Men in Tights\\" but the tights were ripping at the butt seams. And the girls were yelling, \\"Put the Makeup back on...PLEASE!\\"

B000006TRV|2.0|Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" is the kind of album that, had I reviewed it five or six years ago, my opinion would have been quite different. As a teenager going through those emotional ups and downs of adolescence, it's easy to see how the album's theme of isolation and loneliness can resonate with you. But as I grew out of that stage, I looked back on \\"The Wall\\" with much less fondness than I had. Musically, \\"The Wall\\" displays very little of the progessive tendencies of previous Pink Floyd landmarks such as \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\". In fact, at times, it sound quite, to be frank, ordinary. <br /> <br />\\"The Wall\\" is a two-disc \\"Rock Opera\\" about a rock star named Pink, who has been beaten down by life since day one. After losing his father in the war, he is raised by a smothering, overprotective mother, and at school is forced to deal with his cruel teachers. When he grows up, his wife leaves him, and feels suffocated by the pressures of being a rock star. All this leads Pink to create a psychological \\"wall\\", with every painful experience a \\"brick\\", to separate him from the rest of the world. Inside his wall, he imagines himself to be a fascist dictator, until at last his conscience rebels and puts him on an imaginary \\"trial\\" where the wall is finally broken down. It's easy to see many an angsty, alienated teenager finding comfort in these songs (particularly \\"Another Brick in The Wall Part II\\"), but for everyone else, the \\"storyline\\" comes across as needlessly self-pitying and overdone. The \\"story\\" fails to generate any real interest. If a band insists on telling a story through an album, I hold them to the same standard as I would if they had told it through any other medium. We aren't given much reason to care about the main character Pink or feel sorry for him; I doubt many people will be able to relate to rich-but-alienated rock stars. The story tries to sound as though it is portentous and full of deep meaning, but it lacks depth and emotional impact. <br /> <br />This is symptomatic of the fact that Roger Waters, at this point in time, had almost complete control of the band. With the exception of a few tracks, this is essentially a Waters solo album. As a result, the music suffers greatly. With the exception of killer tracks like \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\", the songs on \\"The Wall\\" are bland and ordinary compared to previous Pink Floyd release, totally lacking in anything that might be considered \\"progressive\\". Opener \\"In the Flesh?\\" for example, is a kind of arena-rock that sounds much like something Queen would do. There's none of the eerie, ethereal sound effects of DSOTM or WYWH that made the band something unique. \\"The Wall\\" sounds like a very ordinary rock album. It's not a bad rock album, but it's not Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />Part of the problem is that the storyline takes precedence over the music. Many tracks are simply there to advance the plot, and cannot stand by themselves. These filler tracks, while necessary I suppose to tell the story Waters wanted to tell, only serve to frustrate the listener by breaking up the musical flow and making the whole ordeal much longer than it should. The musical highlights of \\"The Wall\\" could have easily have been condensed onto a single disc. The rest is pure bloat, delving into needlessly theatrical bombast as Waters parades around his suffering for all to see. <br /> <br />As I have said, \\"The Wall\\" is not an album that has aged well for me. Roger Waters' endless self-pitying, and the album's dearth of elements that made Pink Floyd so great just drag the album down into mediocrity. The follow-up \\"The Final Cut\\" was even more Rogers-centered than this, and it's easily one of Pink Floyd's worst. Draw your own conclusions.

0380789035|5.0|Though immigrants brought their hopes, dreams, fears, and, yes, Gods to America, changing times have caused the once-venerated to slowly fade into obscurity. Lack of currency of the pantheon of old in this, the information age, has left the Gods in a desperate struggle to retain their relevancy. The new kids on the block, the Gods of the highway and the Internet (think that's impossibly weird? I recently read an article where Google declared a new hire their \\"Internet evangelist\\"), are drunk on their newfound popularity, want to put a squeeze on the old-school Gods and monopolize all the worship for themselves. A la Stephen King's \\"The Stand,\\" the book slowly builds to an apocalyptic showdown between both factions. Our protagonist, Shadow (guess what deity he embodies?) comes to learn that he may have a more important role than he originally thought.<br /><br />Although, on the surface, the novel treads on areas explored in many of Gaiman's previous works (dream and myth, the inverse and counter-intuitive relationship between worshipper and worshipped), the book is a serious study of the nature of faith and belief in modern America.<br /><br />There are so many `in-jokes' and hidden references here that the book demands a second or third reading to be fully appreciated. Gaiman expertly has us sympathize with even the most seemingly diabolical of characters; his cunning use of the narrator-function frequently tricks and misdirects. Much as Shadow's ever-present coin tricks, Gaiman's own sleight of hand with the story forces the reader to constantly re-evaluate their grasp of the story. And, like a true master, Gaiman isn't revealing his secrets.

B00005ATQ9|5.0|Whenever I want to immerse myself in opulence and almost excessive beauty of image I rewatch this supreme accomplishment in movie-making by the late Stanley Kubrick.  It is not for all  tastes and some may find the pace to be too measured, to stately, or just plain plodding.  If one thinks this that viewer is missing the point of Mr. Kubricks magnum opus. <br /> <br />It won four Academy Awards and very rightly so.  The costumes and wigs are exemplary and accurate, almost to a fault.  One can only imagine the cost of replicating them in a similar movie today.  The outdoor settings are breathing and the indoor scenes takes ones breath away with their magnificence and authenticity. <br /> <br />This may be a movie for very particular tastes and will not appeal to all.  By the way, Ryan ONeal and Marissa Berenson (related to the late art scholar Bernard Berenson) are ideally cast and the actor who plays the chaplain Mr. Runt is in many of Ken Russells movies and is a campy, uptight, and sanctimonious English cleric wonderfully played by that gifted actor. <br /> <br />Immerse yourself of an evening in this cinematic excess and revel in the musical adaptations of some of my favourite composer which exactly mirror the action on the screen. <br /> <br />Timothy Wingate  OTTAWA  CANADA
B000BKJ78U|5.0|I'm not sure what to expect of this DVD Re-release, but I'm sure Lucas is gonna blow our minds with it (for the people that like the changes). I have a feeling that Lucas has made even better sound than before and added to the trilogy of what he wants. A note to George: George, I'm sure you will make this re-release more awesome than the last one (not to say the last one was bad).  <br />I'm very interested in seeing what has changed and what looks just a bit better. One thing to know about Mr. Lucas, he doesn't re-release without some kind of changes taken place. Just look at what he's done so far. Everytime he re-releases he changes stuff. I think it's cool. One thing to remember folks, he doesn't do this stuff to please people. He does this to perfect his vision of what he wants out of his movies. Just face reality folks, you're never gonna see the Star Wars Trilogy the way it first came out in theaters. To George Lucas, after he gets done fixing everything up that he wants to, adds anything he wants to and makes these films 3D, these versions are gonna be the only originals to him. This is what he wants, not us. This is what he wants us to see, not what we want to see. <br />Just remember, the reason why George has created all of his own companies and only has gone with 20th Century Fox is because they were the only ones that would let him tell the story the way he wanted, when eveybody else wanted him to change it to what the audience wanted to see instead of what he wanted to do. This is why he is the way that he is. I say either like what he's done, or don't be into Star Wars at all. This is his story, not ours.
1883010039|5.0|This is a terrific book for someone who wants to learn to weave. It starts off with a very brief introduction to looms and ancillary tools needed by the weaver.  It then provides a very detailed discussion, complete with many pictures, of how to warp the loom.  The book then leads the reader through a home-study course starting off with a simple weave sample, a good explanation of reading drafts, and an interesting as well as comprehensible explanation of various twills.  My favorite chapter was that on reading drafts----I had looked at a couple of weaving magazines previously and was completely puzzled by them. The author's explanations were so delightfully clear that after reading the chapter once I was able to understand all the patterns I had looked at in the magazines.<br /><br />Throughout, the author explains the details of how to perform each step, what problems might arise, how to prevent them from doing so, and how to fix problems that do arise. Deborah Chandler has a real gift for imparting complex information, and this book amply reflects that gift.<br /><br />Since I am a complete beginner and have never touched a loom before, I would have liked a much lengthier discussion (with diagrams) covering how the various types of looms work as well as their advantages/disadvantages.  That said, even if you don't know how a loom works (which I didn't before reading this book carefully), you can puzzle it all out from the book by seeing what the different steps in warping and weaving are and relating them to the physical structures involved.  It took me a while to puzzle this all out & this is where it would have been nice to have more information on \\"loom theory\\" in general.<br /><br />I was interested in buying a loom and getting started in weaving, but  I wasn't sure I could learn how since there doesn't seem to be anywhere near where I live to take lessons. Since I didn't want to buy a loom I couldn't use, I bought this book first to see if I could learn howto weave from a book without an instructor.  Although I will not know for sure until I give it a try, the book explains things so well and in sufficient detail to make me confident I can do it.  So, reading the book made me decide to take the plunge and order a loom.<br /><br />Wish me luck (and buy this book)!

B000ASATWQ|4.0|The youngest son of the one and only Bob Marley, Damian (Jr. Gong) Marley takes his nickname from his dad's \\"Tuff Gong\\" moniker, and has been strutting his talented genes since he was 13 years old.  This is his third album, after Mr. Marley (1996) and the Grammy award winning \\"Halfway Tree\\" (2001).<br /><br />The first single \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\" stormed the charts on release, with its blaring air horn and Ine Kamoze sample, causing much controversy in his homeland of Jamaica with its hard hitting, critical lyrics about poverty and politics:<br /><br />\\"Come on let's face it, a ghetto education's basic<br /><br />A most a the youths them waste it<br /><br />And when they waste it, that's when they take the guns and replace it<br /><br />Then them don't stand a chance at all\\"<br /><br />The album is an expose of the side of Jamaica the tourists don't see, and music wise is a fusion of reggae, dancehall, R&B and even Hip Hop, starring his brother Stephen, with a guest list that includes Bobby Brown, Nas, Bounty Killer, Buju Banton and others.  He even includes a part of a Marcus Garvey speech in the opening track.<br /><br />Songs to watch are \\"Move\\", which samples his dad's \\"Exodus\\"; \\"Khaki Suit\\", a true dancehall treasure with Bounty Killer; \\"Pimpa's Paradise\\", a sad tale of drugs and prostitution; \\"All Night\\", and \\"In 2 Deep\\", but there are others worth a listen.  An unusual and exciting album for fans of Reggae and Caribbean music.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 7, 2005
B000063JDE|4.0|In my opinion this is Dennis Hopper's best performance ever.  Great film.  Some senstive viewers might get offended by Isabella Rossellini's nude scene or the voyeurism/rape/torture/murder undertones.
0812550706|5.0|This book is a really great book. I read it in 2 days and could not put it down. The only reason it took two days was because i feel asleep around 3:00 AM :-( This is a totally exciting and action packed book. Orson Scott Card is a genious!
B000A3DFZE|1.0|As a lifelong Eric Clapton fan I'm dissappointed in thie effort or should I say lack of effort.  Eric must have owed the record company an album so he gave them this.   <br /> <br />ERic is at his best playing blues because that's were his heart is.  Eric follow your heart.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Lucas put those into the dust long ago...and it's sad, but true. <br /> <br />Otherwise, great transfers, great sounds, MOSTLY what you were looking for... <br /> <br />And the bonus disc is definitely worth the time - the main documentary is definitely worth several viewings in itself. <br /> <br />But the originals are what most people were looking for. <br />Next to those, these reworked movies are garbage by comparison.
0192802372|5.0|There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book at all. It is a very good read, in a very standard binding. You get a good introduction to it and some nice notes which are helpful.    This is set in contemporary times to Austen, and was the heroine which Austen least liked. Emma Woodhouse is young, rich and single. She lives a life of wealth and privilege in a small village just outside of London. In her world, and in her village she is queen. However there are flaws in her character which will be tested.    Austen liked to write about small things, about daily life, and the petty things which people in small communities become obsessed with. And so into Emma's life come the scatter-brained Harriet Smith the daughter of \\"someone\\" who cobbles together what learning she might at a local ladies academy. Emma adopts her and tries to help her make her way in the world by finding her a good match.    Emma's fine world is disrupted when first Mr Elton moves to the village, and then marries a rather smart but upstart woman who wishes to manage everyone's life.     Austen's skill in reflecting Emma and her machinations for good, against Mrs Elton and her machinations for her own good are gloriously done.     Emma is a brilliant novel and its themes are universal and timeless, it is all about the things in life which never change -  love, pride, marriage, status and money.    Don't watch dreadful movie adaptations of this book (like the one Gwyneth Paltrow did) the book is much sharper, wittier and subtler. It is greatly enjoyable reading. The introduction may (or may not) help you to greater understanding of her ability to write with a light, sharp pen. Hopefully the story will stand out for its brilliance.
0143034901|2.0|This is a nice little melodrammatic novel, that has absolutely nothing to do with Borges, Eco, Marquez and other luminaries it is being compared to. While reading it, memories of a Brazilian soap opera I used to watch when still a kid kept bothering me. Maybe this would be a nice start for Zafon's next novel: somebody haunted by a forgotten soap opera. I bought this book partly because the jacket mentioned Eco (not Stephen King), and partly because I love Barcelona. Well, it turned out that King is Eco, when compared to Zafon, because the novel completely lacks the metaphysical dimension. It has all the necessary romance ingredients: trouble in the family, angry parents, suffering teenagers, secret pregnancies, incest, love letters, sick lovers, monomaniac fathers -- you name it. It also is the most kitsch novel I have come upon lately. Not recommended.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this movie. I watch a lot of anime, but I have to say this is the most well animated movie I've seen. You completely forget you're watching a cartoon. The characters just come to life. All of their subtle movements make them seem like real people. Especially Hana the transvestite. She was animated with so much attention to detail. It's so incredible! And then there's the story. Three homeless people find an abandoned baby and go out searching for the mother. These characters show so much heart and you really find yourself caring for them. And each of their situations for why they're homeless are all so real. So then they find the mother and then there's a huge twist in the story which I wont give away. I'll just say the ending is a miracle.<br /><br />Fantastic movie!
B00001U03Q|3.0|As reviewers here state - this is not your guitar on fire Clapton collection.  What it is: a post '80s collection of Clapton's assorted work.  \\"The Best\\" or even \\"Chronicles\\" is somewhat misleading although there are certainly some strong tracks here.<br /><br />I got this for \\"Forever Man\\" and \\"Change the World\\" - two great Clapton tracks.  \\"Before You Accuse Me\\" and \\"It's In the Way that You Use It\\" are cool too.  Other tracks blend in well but some songs like \\"(I)Get Lost\\" and \\"Blue Eyes Blue\\" are pretty uncharacteristic of Clapton and will surprise long time followers.  I seriously doubt their merit in being included in any best-of collection...certainly not songs that any Clapton fan will remember in his legacy.<br /><br />That said, this is not a collection for vintage Clapton fans.  It's more of an above average sampler - not a representative retrospective.  Other recent collections and albums have him exploring his roots. This is more of a glossy summation.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|Let the critics be damned its a Hippy Dream come true man!   This is the Holy Grail of all Rock n Roll Reunions folks. God,is there anyone that Clapton hasn't jammed with in Rock n Roll over the years?  Let Me Know Will You! ( this guy is Unbelievable )  Now he talked Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker into a Cream Mega Reunion after they said they never talk to each other again 37 years ago. I guess they ran out of cold hard cash again or Nabster cut royality checks in half $( Bad Luck ) bad sign!  The only thing that can beat this is a UFO landing and have Jimi Hendrix come out and Jam with these guy's again. Really!  There is a God its CREAM, This power trio thankfully  returns with a Rock n Roll Retirement Cash In that kicks everybody's ass one third their age hands down. Same old songs that some how sounds new and better now ( FRESH CREAM ).   There back in their old stomping grounds the Royal Abert Hall and the Soda & Popcorn sales are jumping and the hallways shaking again like back in the day!   Jack even plays his bass sitting in a chair and has trouble breathing sometimes ( to many cigarettes ) but that's rock n roll folks. He really looks cool though for a old guy with a $9,000.00 custom made violin bass in hand. He seems to be happy to be back with the boy's (He smiles a lot)  Clapton's Old Blackie Strat makes a triumpant return on stage, and its still smoking and cooling off after this 2005 concert  is long over. Its now back in its guitar case heading home and can't wait for more action later. Can I smell a Mega Tour coming  - Hello-  and how much is the ax worth now $300,000.00 I guess!    Ginger's right he is better than Keith Moon and that Led Zepplin Drummer- you know what's his name? and he likes his new DW drum kit and talking about selling tee shirts and stuff! do I smell advertizing - but its fun and he sings too, his family made him do it, or he couldn't play with the boy's he said.  There is alot of bald heads in the audience, but everybody's oldernow and I mean everybody! ( Its not 1968 anymore kids)  But the band looks good for having survived the 60's and living to tell about it you know  You get the usual hot chick shots in the crowd acting goofy who were not even born when Cream broke up and was that Jimi Page and Brian May in the crowd that I saw?   ( the Royality of Rock ) at the Hall while Cream was showing them all how its done! They still play with fire in there hearts  after 40 years   All I can say is there is a heaven its with Cream at the Royal Albert Hall in 2005   This is a must have DVD in any concert collection     Im So Glad  so very very Glad    the very best of, Goodbuy
B000002J27|5.0|After Peter Gabriel left Genesis, drummer Phil Collins became the lead singer. Collins's songwrting doesn't dominate the record and this is not poppy as their records that would follow. Also Steve Hackett is still playing guitar. The music is really good and Collins's vocals and drums are superb throughout. Favorites include Dance On A Volcano, Entangled, Squonk, Robbery, Assault And Battery, Ripples, A Trick Of The Tail. Highly Recommended.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Very good album, I was anxious about it and I bought it the very first day of the european release. Very melodic as always, nice rythm, cool fussions, pretty good lyrics, really catchy.<br /><br />nice album
B00000IGGA|5.0|Tom Waits's follow-up to Bone Machine is amazingly superior. Not that Bone Machine was bad, only a few songs stood out to me. Every song on this album stands out to me. Hold On is the saddest songs I ever heard and I almost cry to it. Also the other ballads are good. Waits also mixes blues and Bone Machine's sound to make it one of his best album's. Also big plus for the funny opening track Big in Japan, which features Primus (Waits has collabarated with them on two of their records), where Waits attacks himself and his fame. Can't get enough of this album, should be put next to most of his classic early albums. Favorites include Big In Japan, Hold On, Get Behind The Mule, House Where Nobody Lives, Cold Water, Pony, Eyeball Kid, Picture In A Frame, Chocolate Jesus, Filipino Box Spring Hog, Take It With Me, and Come On Up To The House. Highly Highly Recommended.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Tight!!, very good album, great riffs and rythm by Morello.<br /><br />Cornell with the same talent you can expect from him, very good second album, lots of easy listening melodies, and some nice crunch with overdiven guitars. My favorite song in the album is \\"My #1 zero\\" nice and dark, with anger at the end.
B00003CXAW|5.0|Here it is folks, the opening debut of one of the most iconic monsters in film history. He will go down in history with my boy Godzilla as the greats of the monster screen. Without Kong most of the great prehistoric and giant monster movies would never been made. There is nothing better than an island full of giant prehistoric creatures and a super powerful giant ape, with a bunch of humans up for pickings. Classic scenes, T-Rex fight, empire state building scene and so much more. Take it from a true fan of films like this, this is what started all pick yourself up a copy for hours of entertainment.
B00005T7I1|3.0|It's funny. It's romatic. It's exciting. What more could you want from a film? Well I'll tell you, this movie should of had profanity, blood, and especiall full nudity for an action to make it more adult. Why I say those things cause for this suppose to be a kids movie it had a lot of machine guns people getting shot at and kill on the scean not one time was their any blood flesh on their body, gambling, drinking, smoking, and a little risque humor from Madonna coming on to Dick Tracy played by (Warren Beatty) and the way she was dress is a slight revealing. Al Pacino played an awesome part on being Big Boy he stole the show.
1400032717|4.0|I read this book as part of an assignment for our book club. I would not have chosen this on my own, but am very happy that I read it. I was fortunate to have had further translation of this book by a member of our book club that provided additional insight and pointed that this author did a terrific job of capturing the inner life of autism. While the story has its ups and downs following the life of the boy, I found that I learned quite a bit about not only autism, but a perspective on autism as well. This book provided great discussion and an entertaining insightful read.
B000A6T1KE|1.0|Sorry folks, but this movie not the Star Trek of just a few years ago. It was so boring, a yawner! I waited the whole film for something to happen and when if finally did, I could care less. This is not one of the 50 minute TV shows that used to get a little boring with all the talk, talk, talk, which would mercifully end at the top of the hour. This is a movie, they can't make talk fests out of them and expect them to be good. <br /> <br />The Captan seemed out of character too, what was the deal with him being so happy in the beginning? And Data, boring, he ceased to be interesting when half the movie was about him and him! Then you had Picard and Picard why didn't the writers think to bring in Will and Will? <br /> <br />All in all a very lousy movie. I thought the last one was bad but this one was really bad. <br /> <br />How sad, that the advertised last voyage ended up as bad as Star Trek the Motion picture!

B00000JSJC|5.0|\\"Strange Days\\" literally has something for everyone. Science fiction, violence, peace, romance, comedy, tragedy, action, you name it it's all in this film an done with class and intellegence. I agree that this one is destined to become a cult classic. however, be prepaired for one of the edgiest, most violent and emotionally eshausting films you've ever seen (the first three minutes of the film make it very clear what you can expect from the rest). There are at least five climactic scenes toward the end, which must break some kind of record.

B000093BDX|3.0|What could the Beach Boys do? Well, they could sing! Anything else? Uh... um... hm... oreo cookies taste good? Seriously, I can't think of any reason to listen to this group unless one was a fan of vocal music. Like I said, they could harmonize. Sure. But there are far better harmonizers out there (The Beatles, who had the Beach Boys beat on EVERY count, Simon & Garfunkle, CSN, anyone from Motown) who ALSO usually brought far more interesting lyrics, melodies and instrumental performances (Especially The Funk Brothers, Motown's underrated house band) to the table.<br /><br />Their catalogue of hits was also a mixed bag. While the tremendously forward-thinking Good Vibrations was one of the greatest singles of its time, while Fun, Fun, Fun is exactly that, while In My Room is a well-arranged masterpiece of introspection that's surprisingly innocent considering its title, Don't Worry Baby is an immaculately made love song, and three of the five real worthwhile tracks from not-as-good-as-history-deems-it Pet Sounds (God Only Knows, Wouldn't It Be Nice, Sloop John B - Caroline, No and I Just Wasn't Made for These Times would've been welcome), some of this is superbly trite and obnoxious. You can pretty much skip over anything with \\"Surf\\" in its title - Surfin' U.S.A., Surfer Girl, Surfin' Safari - or the two pathetic car songs Little Deuce Coup (eeeeew...) and Shut Down - I'm neither a surfer nor a car enthusiast, so I can't relate to either of these song's themes. But there's more wretched bile, don't worry about that - Help Me, Rhonda is a silly artifact of the psychedelic era at best. Similarly, Barbara Ann, Dance Dance Dance and California Girls (along with the aforementioned surf and car songs) are artifacts of the early '60's, where rock was entering a VERY brief stagnant phase (1961-1964 - the only real interesting new acts were The Beatles and Dylan, as even The Who and The Stones, who would later be great, were still working a few bugs out). And their version of Rock and Roll Music is a disgrace to Chuck Berry fans (me included) everywhere. The only surf song I like is Kokomo - I know it's hated by fans, but it's better than, say, Be True to Your School or When I Grow Up (to Be a Man) and catcchy. Veeeeeeeeeeery catchy...ck and Roll Music is a disgrace to Chuck Berry fans (me included) everywhere.

B000AM4PBS|5.0|I luv it luv it luv it!!!!! Friends is by far my favorite series!!!!!! I really miss them, they make me laugh and i watch all ten episodes over and over again. I can never get bored of \\"Friends\\". The characters all together make it so special and so amazingly funny that we cannot seperate them. Friends wont be the same without Monica or Chandler or Rachel or Joey or Phebie or Ross!!! Plus it's a nice box set at a special price. As a Friends fan I would definitly own this box set :)
B00004Z459|1.0|While they're better than Slipknot, Limp Bizkit and Korn, they're not really all that good. Their songs are pretty dull (Zero creativity was put into the making of these records) and are overplayed. Just more stupidity from rap-metal band #9,120,462,214.5531.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|This CD was a relative disappointment considering the previous work from Death Cab for Cutie.
B000002OZY|4.0|In terms of historical significance, I give Tommy five stars. But I don't write reviews based on significance I write them based on the quality of the contained music.<br />In this case, it's mostly good...Overture, 1921, Sparks, Amazing Journey, Cousin Kevin, Acid Queen, Underture, Pinball Wizard, the mirror sequence (Go to the Mirror Boy, Tommy Can You Hear Me and Smash the Mirror) and We're Not Gonna Take It are all solid pieces of music. My problem with Tommy is the overload of pieces that seem to have no purpose other than to move the plot forward. (It's a Boy, Do You Think It's Alright<br />Fiddle About, There's a Doctor, Miracle Cure, Tommy's Holiday Camp) and Christmas is a pretty lousy tune.<br />But my big problem with this is how unbelievable it is. I mean, what are the chances of someone being born blind, deaf and dumb, cured by pinball, converted into a religous icon, then betrayed by your own followers, all put together in a sketchy plotline? Yeah, that does seem fairly slim. And the only people who can relate to the story are the deaf, dumb and blind people, who don't even know this album exists.<br />Although there is a lot of good music, and I'd recommend it to anybody who likes concept albums, Who's Next is still the Who's best record by several miles.<br />As an addition, I grow tired of babysitting some of the more musically ignorant reviewers. Clarence Thomas claimed that The Who were \\"heavily influenced by Oasis and Hanson\\". Guess what? The Who were formed at least a quarter-century before either Oasis or Hanson, moron! And to the \\"Kid Reviewer\\" who babbled on forever about this being Tom Jones' worst CD, he isn't even on this album! The band is called The Who, the album is called Tommy. Do you people THINK before you write your reviews?
B00005AQF7|5.0|In 1992, Dr. Dre created the G-Funk and the first G-Funk classic \\"The Chronic\\". And also let the whole world know who Snoop Dogg is. And in 1993, Snoop Dogg's first album \\"Doggystyle\\" came out. This album is another G-Funk classic. Every type of mood on it - party, gangsta, and soft. It was recorded as the first top-charted-debut album. All songs produced by Dr. Dre! <br /> <br />1. Bathtub (N/A) <br /> <br />2. G Funk Intro (5/5) - Very exciting. The Lady Of Rage raps crazily and Snoop just talks about the introduction of G-Funk Era. <br /> <br />3. Gin & Juice (5/5) - Classic. Snoop goes so well with the laid-back G-Funkin' Dr. Dre-produced beat! One of the best tracks on this album. And very addictive. It's well-known for the famous line - \\"They ain't livin' 'til 6 in tha morning~\\". <br /> <br />4. Tha Shiznit (5/5) - This is crazy. Needless to say Dre's beat is so gangsta and Snoop flows damn well. Lyrics are interesting. <br /> <br />5. Lodi Dodi (5/5) - It's almost the remix version of Doug E. Fresh & Slick Rick's original one. Snoop made a good story and the way of him imitating Slick Rick is kinda funny. <br /> <br />6. Murder Was The Case (5/5) - Classic. Snoop made a very good story again on this song. Daz featured on it as an evil-voice-having ghost. Everybody has to listen to this classic G-Funk track. <br /> <br />7. Serial Killa (5/5) - Tha Dogg Pound and RBX featured on it. Contains a sample from The Ohio Players' \\"Funky Worm\\". Everybody raps well to the great beat. <br /> <br />8. Who Am I (What's My Name)? (5/5) - Classic. Snoop's rapping is very catchy and gangsta. If you play this song in the club, all the people will take off their clothes and go mad. <br /> <br />9. For All My N****z & B****es (5/5) - It's Tha Dogg Pound's track. The Lady Of Rage featured on it. Daz & Kurupt drop some bombs on it and Snoop does too a little bit. <br /> <br />10. Aint No Fun (If The Homies Cant Have None) (5/5) - Kurupt, Nate Dogg and Warren G featured on it. Themood is kinda bright. G-Funk Gangsta-Lovin' track. <br /> <br />11. Doggy Dogg World (5/5) - Tha Dogg Pound and The Dramatics on it! Snoop, Daz & Kurupt are great but you have to listen carefully when The Dramatics sing. It's a perfect idea to invite them as guest appearances. <br /> <br />12. Gz And Hustlas (5/5) - It contains one of Snoop's most powerful rappings. The beat is crazy again and lyrics are impressive. <br /> <br />13. Pump Pump (4/5) - Lil' Malik is better than Snoop on it. He was young then. But he drops some unbelievable gangsta lyrics on it. <br /> <br />I'm Korean who's only 15 and recommending this G-Funk classic to everyone. This album will make your ears hot.
B000002OX7|5.0|Seeing that a couple of the bonus tracks are dumb, I'm basing this review on the nine pieces included on the original LP (Baba O'Riley, Bargain, Love Ain't For Keeping, My Wife, The Song Is Over, Gettin' in Tune, Going Mobile, Behind Blue Eyes and Won't Get Fooled Again).<br />Baba O'Riley is a masterful work, part of the abandoned Lifehouse project. Building from a synth riff into an explosion of hard rock, O'Riley would stand as the second-best track on the album. Bargain friggin' rocks, one of my favorite Who tunes with great synthesizer and Keith going nuts on the drums. It takes a bit of growing into, but once you've grown into it, it's great. My Wife is really funny in spite of John Entwhistle's flat voice, and Song is Over is a great, maturely-written piece of work. There's a lot going on in this song, with pseudo-symphonic synthesizer, Pete taking an all-too-rare vocal (not to mention a guitar solo you wish would never end, though it sadly does after about a half-minute). An underlooked masterpiece right there, in my mind it's the album's second-best behind Baba o'Riley.<br />Side two would have to stand as one of the best sides of rock and roll. Gettin' in Tune, Going Mobile, Behind Blue Eyes and Won't Get Fooled Again...somebody must've told them this was a winning combination. First, Gettin' in Tune, another song that builds from quiet to hard. Next, Going Mobile, which is another funny song about a guy in a trailer park. Third, Behind Blue Eyes, another amazing song from the perspective of the villian of Lifehouse. It's truly mind-blowing.<br />But that's nothin' compared to the closer, Won't Get Fooled Again, which stands as my favorite Who song. Similar to Baba O'Riley, it builds from a simple synth riff to a loud, rebellious rocker about a man's opinions of a revolution (\\"I'll tip my hat to the new constitution/take a bow to the new revolution/pick up my guitar and play/just like yesterday/then I'll get on my knees and pray/we won't get fooled again!\\") 7:44 into the song, Roger Dartley lets out an ear-piercing scream and howls, \\"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss!\\", one of the best lines in the history of rock.<br />How can you not own this classic? Seriously, how? No self-respecting rock fan can do without it.<br />My last words are to 85 Delorean, who is obviously very young (so am I, for anyone about to slam me with ageism). Why? Who's Next was released a good 26 years before anything Limp Bizkit ever made, so if anything Limp Bizkit ripped the Who's version of Behind Blue Eyes (BTW, Limp Bizkit is crap) and this album peaked at #4 in its day.

B000AMMSQC|5.0|I bought this because of Svetlana Zakharova and the rarely seen Bourmeister choreography. Zakharova dances beautifully. To the reviewer who commended on the fouettes, I have never seen the Bourmeister version performed with 32 fouettes, just 24 or 28 (not sure). But in any case the fouettes are only a trick and not what makes a good Odette/Odile. Zakharova is a great Odette and a very good Odile. <br /> <br />The La Scalla ballet are average as usual. The sets and costumes are good. The editing of the video is very annoying with frequent cuts and changes of camera angle that ruin the choreography. After watching this and various other dance DVDs almost ruined by bad editing, I propose to leave the editing to the choreographers or the ballet masters. At least they know what the important parts are!!! <br />
000675368X|5.0|This superb adaptation by Amanda Benjamin of the C. S. Lewis children's classic is available as stand alone book (hardback and paperback) and book and cassette recording read by Nickolas Grace.  Birmingham's true-to-life illustrations complement the narrative magnificently and, dare I say it, will stand the test of time equally as well as have the beloved original illustrations by Pauline Baynes.  Amanda Benjamin's adaptation of the original story is faithful to the narrative of C. S. Lewis' story.  It neither avoids nor sugar-coats the treachery of Edmund, nor the grim event of Aslan's sacrifice. Though not an abrigement, the narrative maintains the joy and thrills and mysterious wonder of the cherished Lewis story.<br /><br />I've 'road tested' this lovely book with my own young niece and nephew (aged 8 and 10) and have had as much enjoyment seeing their excitement and happiness as I got when I first read the story at 11.<br /><br />A first class Christmas or birthday present for any child who enjoys reading, listening to a good story or appreciates beautiful artwork.
B00006RINF|4.0|Originally, I bought \\"In a Reviere\\" by Lacuna Coil and was very dissappointed. I liked only one or two songs on the CD. Later, after listening to smaples of this CD, I decided to try them one more time, and how glad I am that I did! <br /> <br />1. Swamped-(4/5): A good introduction and Christina's singing in the very beginning makes the song sound even more haunting. <br /> <br />2. Heaven's a Lie-(4.5/5): Originally, this song really drew me into the CD, and Andrea's vocals are exceedingly better than those on \\"In a Reviere\\". <br /> <br />3. Daylight Dancer-(4/5): A pretty fast paced song, with a very heavy melody. I always liked the refrain's lyrics and the overal sound of the song. <br /> <br />4. Humane-(3.5/5): I was never really attracted to this song. Unlike most of the others, the lyrics and music never really stood out among the other songs on this CD. <br /> <br />5. Self Deception-(4.5/5): I loved the lyrics of this song, especially Christina's line, \\"Lair, you tempt me\\". That line just send chills down my spine everytime I hear it. <br /> <br />6. Aeon-(4/5): Like many others I thought my CD was broken when I first heard this track, but once you listen to the song a few times, you realize how the blank rests between the music gives it a special feel, unique from the other songs. This also happens to be the shortest song on the album. <br /> <br />7. Tight Rope-(5/5): This song builds directly off of \\"Aeon\\". It seems Aeon is like an introduction to this excellent song. The lyrics seem to fit the title well as does the music. <br /> <br />8. The Ghost Woman and the Hunter-(5/5): My absolute favorite song on the album, Christina's vocals are enchanting and really give you a feel as to what the song's about. I loved it! <br /> <br />9. Unspoken-(4.5/5): Another great song following my favorite, I really liked this one. Only, the ending didn't seem as good as it could have been. <br /> <br />10. Entwined-(4/5): A very good song, with another chatchy melody.Andrea's chanting in the background of the refrain adds a lot of character to the song. <br /> <br />11. The Prophet Said-(3/5): The only song I really didn't like on this album. The lyrics didn't catch me and the music just didn't seem to flow well. <br /> <br />12. Angel's Punishment-(5/5): I give this song a 5 because of how it distinguises itself from the other songs. This has to be one of the darest songs on the album and another favorite of mine. <br /> <br />13. Comalies-(4/5): This is part Italian, part English, but it bleans really well together. A great way to end the album. <br /> <br />Once again, I'm glad I gave this band another chance. I definately recommend this CD to those who  are looking for powerful and beautiful music.

B00003CXSM|5.0|In The Wedding Planner, Jennifer Lopez plays a perfectionist wedding planner who has been unsuccessful finding love herself.  She becomes hopeful after being rescued by a hot stranger on the street, then finds out that he is the groom-to-be in a major account.  Will she break the wedding planner's cardinal rule of not falling in love with the groom? <br /> <br />At the same time, viewers see her relationship with her traditional Italian father and his kind, Scrabble-playing friends.     <br /> <br />It's a light hearted movie with a good dose of saccharine.  However, the well-written story, sympathetic characters, and interesting plot make it a good movie for a light evening.
0740748475|5.0|Pre-ordered it months ago, and it arrived a few days ago. Heavy, beautifully bound, gorgeous saturated colours, that smell of ink and promise when new sections are opened.    I loved the strip when it first ran, and have many (but not all) of the books. My seven-year-old son and I had been reading them piecemeal for over a year now.    Now, with this complete set, he and I have started at the very first comic, and will read them all, in order, together over the coming months. A little like a jailor reading the \\"Anarchist Handbook\\" to the inmates, perhaps, but it seems in keeping with the spirit of the strip.      And I disagee with those who think the set only belongs on a shelf. Yes, they are heavy, and may become slightly worn by use. But there is too much joy and delight in these pages to let them sit unread.

B000062YAZ|4.0|Forget all about that poseur album \\"Master of Puppets\\".  If you want the ultimate metal album, look no further than Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\".  Before I discovered \\"Reign\\" back in the mid 90s, I considered Metallica the ultimate metal band.  How wrong I was!  This record is ten times heavier than anything Metallica ever put out.  Its so heavy that it would make even the heaviest Metallica song look like the soundtrack to \\"Saturday Night Fever\\"!  The band members aren't exceptionally skilled musicians, but skill isn't what matters in thrash metal; thrash metal is all about the ATTITUDE!  That \\"in your face\\" attitude is taken to the extreme on every song.  Tom Araya has the most \\"in your face\\" voice ever, he would make a boot camp drill seargent look like a deaf mute!  All the songs have the most brutal hooks ever committed to vinyl, once you've heard \\"Angel of Death\\" once, you'll never forget it as long as you live, because it is so heavy.  In closing, I'd just like to say that this is the heaviest record in existence.  It makes Metallica look like the Village People!  If records were physically as heavy as they sounded, \\"Reign in Blood\\" would be a block of solid lead, and \\"Master of Puppets\\" would be a sheet of aluminum foil.  Metallica $ucks serious @ss!  Slayer are the true kings of metal!
B00079FUI6|4.0|\\"Desperate Housewives\\" Season 1 is a must for your TV on DVD collection. It's packed with extra features, the episodes are in a widescreen format, and the quality of the set is great. There are just minor flaws that hold it back from being a \\"great\\" DVD set.<br /><br />One of my complaints is that the extra features is spread out on the six discs. Why? Yes, some of it makes sense, such as having the extended episodes on the discs that the original episode appeared on. Yet, some of the short documentaries and specials, to me, could have been easily moved and shifted to one disc and one more episode could have been added to each disc in order to make room for a simple special features disc.<br /><br />The disc menu is a bit challenging. I had to click on various arrows on my remote to get around to the title and section that I wanted. The font used for most of the disc is \\"cute\\" and flowery, going along with the suburban housewife theme, but it can get right down hard to read against the background color and when it's everywhere on the screen. Having a long intro whenever you put a disc in was a bit annoying as well. It was fun to watch on the first disc, okay the second, but after a while, it got repetitive.<br /><br />I liked the so called \\"extended\\" episodes and how Cherry would introduce them and let you know how the additional scenes made the episode different or added something more to the season 1 plots, but really. One scene added and it's suddenly an \\"extended\\" episode? Why not include the extended episode in with the regular set of episodes? I don't think anyone would have objected to watching an extended episode rather than the one that appeared on the network. The deleted scenes could have also been worked into the original episodes, for this is all the extended episodes are. Quick, 30 second scenes that are good, but don't exactly make the episode that different or worthy of being called out as \\"extended.\\"<br /><br />That being said, this DVD set has a lot to offer a new audience as well as a regular viewer. I'd recommend everyone listen to the audio commentary. Things that you may have missed or never picked up on will change how you view the show. Unlike some DVD releases where the commenary isn't all that informative, Cherry will tell you what he liked, what he didn't like, why this happened, what should have happened, flubs, everything. It's fun to listen to and great that he didn't hold back that much information.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the \\"Oprah is the new Housewife.\\" This isn't a regular Oprah show appearance/interview. This is actually a 20 or so minute mini episode where Oprah moves into Wisteria Lane as a former runner of a corporation in Chicago with her husband. Her character goes around and interacts with the housewives, stumbling upon some of season 1's great moments. The fashion commentary is another fun introduction to each housewife. I wasn't too thrilled with \\"Housewives around the world\\" and wasn't too impressed by each actress' commentary on their few favorite scenes. Another great featurette is the behind the scenes feature where you learn a little something about season 2 more so than the past season (this is also an introduction to Alfre Woodard's character).<br /><br />There's a lot packed into this release that makes it worth the price tag. The quality of the show, both in writing and filming, comes through. If you go through all the features or at least half of them, you'll learn a lot about the show and the thought that goes into each character. With this, you'll also see why \\"Desperate Housewives\\" is perhaps this decade's \\"Knots Landing,\\" \\"Dallas,\\" or \\"Dynasty.\\" This is one of the few shows that can make you laugh and then cry in the next scene.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love Firefly more than any other show I have ever seen, it would have been the best show for many years if the people at Fox had half a brain. This is a very well written show that has great acting. If you ever wanted to see something different from the regular TV shows out there this is your best bet. I would go into more detail but there are to many great things about the show and there is not enough time or space to put it all. Trust me it is well worth the price you will be very happy with your purchase.  Pick it up then watch the movie they are both amazing.
0790729369|4.0|The original theatrical release was in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  This is a 1.33:1, pan and scan, version that is, essentially, edited from the original release. <br />I have no objection to the narrow-screen version being released, but I really don't understand why the studio would think that any film collector would want to see the chopped version.  It even takes more time for them to prepare the reduced-screen version! <br />C'mon, give us this Meryl Streep film in its correct aspect ratio.  All the rest of her films are.

The unrated version, to me, has practically no differences to the Screen version. There are no extended scenes or scenes that were missing at the movies, at least non that I recognized. Save yourselves the money and buy the regular version. <br />It is still a very \\"Sweet\\" movie.
B0000029AL|5.0|Aerosmith, January 1973, the debut album in all its unpolished glory. Sophistication was soon to come but what this band did not lack at this stage was balls and the songwriting chops of one young Steven Tallarico. Stage name of Tyler, you know, future rock god, reformed addict and king of sleaze. The songs are great on this terribly underated album, easily their most unsung. \\"Dream On\\" is of course an undisputed rock classic played a billion times so yes I am a little tired of it, but \\"Movin' Out\\"? \\"One Way Street\\"? \\"Make It\\" and the immortal \\"Mama Kin\\"? No way!! This record is a joy from start to finish (and what a finish - \\"Walking the Dog\\", could be the definitive version of this song!)The boys in the band give credible performances but I have to agree that the guitar partnership of Perry/Whitford does not impress as they would one album later. The production of the album leaves much to be desired and if the strories are true, blame it on the record company for cheaping out on this future supergroup. Who could blame them? Well all their money was going into Bruce Springsteen. Not a bad choice I guess. But Aerosmith would overcome many other similar slights and self destructive behaviors to emerge as the great American Rock n'Roll band that they are, sappy ballads asside. There is nothing sappy about 'Aerosmith', but more greatness was to follow.

B00005UK1F|3.0|I don't know why some people compare this album to anything Pink Floyd has done, because quite honestly this album doesn't compare.  It is an admirable effort and overall pretty decent, but not even in the same ballpark in terms of greatness as The Wall, or Dark Side of the Moon.    I decided to put the 60 minute opus on while I write this review.  There are some great riffs at the start, and indeed, throughout most of the first 30 minutes, but that's about where it ends.  Kjetil Nordhus' voice kind of reminds me Jonas Renkse, the singer from Katatonia.  It's very pleasant, and has a sad, lamenting quality that doesn't sound overdone.    It's pretty obvious that the 60 minute track is actually several different songs tied together, and in that respect it's not written very well.  Good progressive music is beginning at one point and arriving at an entirely different point and not being able to explain exactly how you got there because it sounds so natural.  An example would be Agalloch's brilliant song In The Shadow of Our Pale Companion.  This track isn't like that.  It's not arranged very well, but it's not bad either.  It's just not something I get lost in.      There are some great moments in this album, though. Great riffs, but most of them happen before minute 33.  Indeed, it's when you're cruising along to a kickass riff that the song drops off a frickin' cliff and goes into a quiet passage. The vocals change, and the woman kind of reminds me of Lisa Gerrard from Dead Can Dance, although less impressive.  This halfway point is usually where I start the CD over, because as I said before everything up to that point is really, really good.  The song just loses a ton of momentum at the halfway point, and even though I've heard the whole thing on more than a couple occasions, I can't be arsed to review it proper.  So I'm just going to say it was less impressive than the first half, although there's some good stuff happening around minute 44-55.    The quiet passagejust doesn't work for me at all, which is unfortunate because it cuts the song in half.  It would've been better to end quiety with it, because then the arrangement would've at least made some sense.    If you're a fan of progressive music, or if you are interested in this band/CD soley on the strength of the bands it is associated with (like me), then you'll probably dig it.  It's certainly not epic SOUNDING, nor is it life-changing, so as long as your expectations are in check you'll be okay.
B00005A46T|5.0|This is the cd that some of the fans of Slipknot don't appreciate. This cd is well done, and well put together. I really like the song \\"Left Behind\\", it is my favorite from the cd. But that is not the only good song on this cd. I believe that Slipknot tried to bring out their darker side with this cd because a lot of the songs have a general dark undertone in them, which I really like. I still think that their Self Titled cd was their best one, but this cd definitely has it's place as a very good Slipknot album.

B000B0WODA|5.0|This album does not disappoint.  I try not to compare it to the first; they have their differences, and are excellent for slightly different reasons, but both are absolutely amazing.  These guys are superb, and one of my favorite bands of all time.  Anybody with the opportunity to see them live definitely should. <br /> <br />I adore all the tracks on here, which is rare for me.  Although I'm already a little tired of their single Do You Want To.  If that says anything about how many times I've already listened to the CD, heard them on the radio, watched the music video, etc. etc.  These guys are original and I love all of them.  Kapranos tends to steal a lot of the attention, but what frontman doesn't? <br /> <br />I think if I had to pick, Walk Away might be my favorite track since it's a bit different from what you'd expect from them.  Outsides is equally fantastic, and The Fallen has such a great sound to it to, and highly amusing and original lyrics. <br /> <br />Don't miss out on this amazing album.  It's something you can dance to, listen to extremely loudly on the way to work and overall just rock out to in a very pasty, awkward white girl kinda way. <br /> <br />And guys, even though the majority of Franz fans are obsessive teenage girls, don't be ashamed!  Franz is for everybody :)
B000AXSN5G|3.0|Having read decent reviews of this CD, and admiring NY in general, I bought this disc recently, and have to say that I was overall not impressed.  A couple of the songs were quite good, but overall I'd recommend listening to it before buying it.  Some folks love everything that Mr. Young has put out but, being a old guy, I tend to like the more lyrical albums like \\"Harvest\\" and Harvest Moon, along with old classics like \\"Neil Young with Crazy Horse\\".  I just didn't find that the quality of the songs and soul of the performance was up to those standards.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Along with the Allman Bros at Fillmore East, \\"Everybody Knows this is Nowhere\\" were the two LP's that I played over and over when I was 12 years old. I \\"borrowed\\" them from my big brother's LP collection when he was out doing the drugs & that VietNam revolution thing while I had to stay home. I later received my brothers whole collection when he passed away in a car accident when he was 23 and I was 14. Man I used to crank these songs up to 9 and a half on an old Kenwood stereo that my stepdad always played Willie and Johnny Cash on. \\"I proceeded to buy every Neil Young solo album and this is a great compilation if you want a Neil Young primer without hearing all the regular songs he wrote, I was suprised \\"Tonight's the Night\\" wasn't on here but every other great song Neil ever did is here in a clean sounding CD. \\" Like a Hurricane\\" makes me think of my 1st wife because it describes my relationship with her perfectly. In the Katrina and Rita aftermath it could have been written in Sept.of 2005. I would recommend this set to everyone like me that has all their Neil songs on LP and just want to hear him at his very best on every song. \\"Southern Man\\",\\"After the Gold Rush\\", and \\"Ohio\\"(I read it was done in 2 takes) still hit me in the chest like they did the first time I heard them in the early seventies. I even learned to play \\"Needle and the Damage Done\\" on guitar and I'm a drummer. That's the song he wrote about Danny Whiten's heroin addiction and subsequent deathe which scared Neil straight. Just to hear that song evokes emotions that'll trounce your emotional buttons every time you hear it. Especially if you've lived it. \\"Rockin in the Free World\\" is near the end and a fitting send off of a great Neil Young set. Even if you're just a casual Neil Young listener this is the CD to have.

This is usually not a great recommendation but I was feeling easily influenced at the time.<br /><br />I set the book aside for a time because I was preoccupied with other readings and just barely skimmed it and just as I was about to embark on a trip to Kong Kong I really started getting involved in the book.  Suffice it to say that I read most of the book on my long flights to and from Hong Kong.<br /><br />The plotting was intricate and totally and absolutely engrossing.

B0000024SD|5.0|Am afraid I don't know where to begin. So we'll start with relevance. The lyrics are pure poetry and therefore are timeless indeed. I think the term 'protest songs' does little justice as a portrayal of the songs on this album. After all the society we live in is corrupt and am not sure that to call attention to it, to point out the obvious is a protest. I would argue that an artist who can contrast the lives we lead with the inherent contradictions in them is a true artist and in this sense Mr.Dylan is art. I'm not sure how Mr.Dylan came up with these lyrics and am not sure he could know either (as he confessed on 60 Minutes) but in a world filled with inane lyrics and dressed up tunes that come from the surface, these words have a meditative quality about them. The music is spare, despite the use of the electric guitar on some tracks, and this is exactly what gives the songs the immediacy and intimacy that you'd be hardpressed to find in the musical universe. <br /> <br />To come back to relevance, this little piece of It's All Right Ma, should seal my case: <br /> <br />Advertising signs that con you <br />Into thinking you're the one <br />That can do what's never been done <br />That can win what's never been won <br />Meantime life outside goes on <br />All around you
0790740443|5.0|The typical scifi story of a trained and battle worn warrior chosen at birth to be a deadly and obedient soldier of Nietzschean proportions that finds his sensitive side among the inhabitants of a planet used as a garbage heap for space faring travelers. Warrior  spends childhood killing and conquering, warrior spends adulthood killing and conquering, warrior as veteran is disposed of in place of faster and stronger warriors, warrior finds love, community, sensitivity, and sheds tears, warrior mercilessly kills and conquers yet again. Great movie, great science fiction, definitely worth checking out.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|What a daunting task director Martin Scorsese had in approaching this subject.  Throughout Dylan's 45 year public career he has defied easy definition.  Imagine if Scorsese decided to tackle the total of Dylan's career and not just up to 1966.  By using archival materials and interviews with Dylan's contemporaries and associates Scorsese tries to give us an idea as to who Dylan is but that even proves elusive.  The interview subjects even seem befuddled by Bob.  Even interviews with Dylan himself prove to be evasive and cryptic. Scorsese, a noted music buff, painstakingly catalogs potential influences on Dylan from the folk, blues, rock, and country-western scene.  That approach even hits a brick wall because alot of the artists in these genres consider Dylan to be traitorous.  Anybody going into this film looking for the definitive portayal of Dylan will be sadly disappointed.  Anybody who has followed his career to any degree know that's an unattainable task.  I've seen Dylan four times in my life since 1981 and at no one concert were my expectations met, the least satisfying being the 1986 tour with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers as his backing band.  Would I go back?  In a heartbeat.  Dylan may not meet my preconceived expectations but at least he's an artist who does things on his terms.  Scorsese is an artist in another medium who recognizes that and is shrewd enough not to box Dylan in but allow us to make our own judgement.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I would have to agree with the newspaper critic who said that \\"Firefly was too good to survive Network Television\\". It is a complex story, with complex characters, and a rich background, much of which is never fully explained. This combination would make any network exec see \\"cancellation\\" stamped all over the script. The show defies the \\"cookie cutter\\", stamped out of a mold sci-fi that the networks tell us we want. <br /> <br />The cast is filled with excellent actors, who quickly become real people with unique flaws, strengths, and mysteries of their own. The cast fits together so well that the loss of a single character, any character, would mean the end of the story. <br /> <br />In the real world there is no sound in space. There is no sound in space in Firefly either. I consider this a strength, as so few people can resist the urge to follow the Hollywood conceit that sound in space scenes makes them more dramatic. I felt that the drama was heightened by the added realism. <br /> <br />My personal favorite episode is \\"War Stories\\", an episode filled with peril, humor, and courage. Each character also shows a diffent side to their personalities, as some of their usual roles get reversed. Except of course for Jayne. Jayne is almost a constant, as his personality is so narrow. He is not one-dimensional however, just very consistant. <br /> <br />Wash, and Zoe really shine in this episode. Zoe walks a very fine line between her loyaty to Wash (her husband), and Mal (her captain), and makes it look easy. Wash, a self-described, Semi-muscular man, takes on a tough guy aspect that would be out of character if not for the subtle touches of humor that tinge every scene he is in. He delivers a tough guy speech, with all the machismo of a big action star, while cocking the smallest gun I have ever seen. <br /> <br />Mal is put through the wringer in a big way, and shows off his strength as a leader. We also see that he is a big fan of the \\"eye for an eye\\" concept.  <br/> <br />The other characters shine as well but there are five more, and I'm sure that I would run out of space if tried to cover them all. Suffice to say, this series is definately good sci-fi. It would even appeal to people who are not sci-fi fans, or Josh Wheden fans. Everyone who is tired of \\"same old, same old\\" tv should definately see Firefly. <br /> <br />Thank you for your time, <br /> <br />Sundiver
B000BB14YY|5.0|In the twilight of Akira Kurosawa's career he lost none of his ability to captivate audiences.  Whereas his early works took their cue from the American western milieu Kurosawa tackles Shakespearian themes here but reimagines it in a medieval Eastern setting.  The film tackles such themes as vanity, ambition, greed among other deadly sins.  It is also a sprawling epic that does not overwhelm the characters and their foibles.  The film is beautifully shot with a number of memorable setpieces.  It is tragedy on a grand scale but that should not dissuade you from seeing this essential film in this master filmmaker's storied canon.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|I am a dedicated AC/DC, and let me tell you, this by far AC/DC's best DVD concert.  The song list is awesome, because you get some songs you dont usually hear, like High Voltage being sung by Brian Johnson, and a sweet little solo being followed by Jailbreak.  The DVD is amazing quality, the song quality is awesome, especially on surround sound on a big screen or plasma screen tv, or you everday tv, it feels like you were in Donington rockin' right next to Angus.  I also love the interviews with the band members, and the spotlight songs on Angus, Cliff, Brian, Malcolm and Chris.  Do yourself the favor, if you haven't already, and by this AC/DC Concert DVD, this DVD is in my personal favorite collection. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Rock on, and Ride on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-Guitar Man
B00005JNTX|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a long time. AND IT KICKS ASS!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!
0553212621|1.0|I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality.<br /><br />It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.<br /><br />Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the \\"mental life\\" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of \\"woman\\" or \\"man\\"; and so on.<br /><br />Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.<br /><br />Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's \\"wrong\\" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing \\"that kind\\" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward \\"druglike\\" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.<br /><br />Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a \\"user\\", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a \\"user\\".)<br /><br />It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex.<br /><br />This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a \\"real\\" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples.<br /><br />A woman who lays there \\"unfeeling\\" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.<br /><br />On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urgeto be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he \\"spoilt\\" her.<br /><br />As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.<br /><br />These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and \\"perform\\". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part.<br /><br />Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men \\"want to hear\\". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being \\"sexist\\". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not \\"come to the crisis\\" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man.<br /><br />It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as \\"intimacy\\" and \\"connection\\", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child.<br /><br />So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman \\"should\\" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.<br /><br />There's a lot of talk of \\"tenderness\\" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow \\"lacking tenderness\\" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find.<br /><br />I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book.

B00079018K|4.0|The pleasure of hearing Kasabian's L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forver) for the first time is immediate and undeniable. The rest of their self-titled debut is excellent as well. Tracks like Club Foot, Processed Beats and Running Battle are as danceable as they are listenable (even if the lyrics don't make sense).    Echoes of Verve, Stone Roses, Blur and Ride can be heard. But none of those groups had a single album with as many good songs.    Aside from the Copy Protection annoyance, there is no reason not to get this classic disc.    [DW]
B00005JODA|5.0|John Le Carre has found his ideal cinematic interpreters in screenwriter Jeffrey Caine and director Fernando Meirelles. Caine has made a thrilling, urgent screenplay out of Le Carre's novel \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" and Meirelles--building on the success of his debut film \\"City of God\\"--creates a breathlessly compelling portrait of a world in chaos, thanks to the greed and cruelty of corporate-government hotshots who see the world's poor only as so many guinea pigs. Meirelles, once again demonstrating his flamboyant mastery of film technique, brilliantly contrasts vibrantly colored but chaotic scenes of African poverty with gray, chilly, oh-so-discreet visions of the halls of power in London and Berlin. The story unfolds in jigsaw fashion, as Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a decent, emotionally reticent English diplomat, investigates the mysterious death of his passionate activist wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz). We react with the same sickened horror as Quayle as he uncovers evidence of pharmaceutical companies committing wholesale slaughter on impoverished Africans, aided and abetted by governmnent colleagues he'd thought of as friends. Fiennes and Weisz (whose story is told in flashbacks) give Oscar-worthy performances, and there are also superb supporting performances by Bill Nighy, Pete Postlethwaite, Danny Huston and Hubert Kounde. \\"The Constant Gardener\\" gives us all the thrills we expect of a movie of its type, but its echoes of real-world geopolitics feel unsettlingly real.
B0009353IW|4.0|It's all here in Ry's music. This place that used to exist, when Los Angeles was still a cruel little town and not a megalopolis. 'Chavez Ravine' is an emotional time-capsule for this native son, and completely unexpected in its beauty and poetry.  <br /> <br />This is a place worth knowing, and I haven't experienced anything that has brought back my childhood in L.A. like this music. What's inside these songs?  The richness of the stories, and that mixto of latin, blues and folk that is the real L.A. sound. And then there's that essential American thing: baseball <br /> <br />\\"Mister, you're a baseball man <br />As anyone can plainly see. <br />Greatest game in this great land, <br />Take a little tip from me. <br />I'm working nights, parking cars <br />Underneath the moon and stars. <br />Same ones that we all knew <br />Back in nineteen fifty-two. <br />And if you want to know  <br />Where a local boy like me is coming from: <br />Third base, Dodger Stadium.\\" <br />--Ry Cooder <br /> <br />I'm from L.A.  Born at St. Vincent's in '54, a few blocks down Sunset from Chavez Ravine.  I laid in bed nights in the early 60's, listening to the radio in the dark as Vin called another win by Kofax.  Somehow I got a job working in the press box at Dodger Stadium while in high school in the early 70's. Had family in Elysian Heights since the early 80's -- that's the neighborhood over the ridge from Chavez Ravine -- and I've hiked up and down those brown hills. <br /> <br />It's all there in the music of 'Chavez Ravine'. Ry Cooder has proven himself time and again to be a true artist, illuminating both the human heart and condition.  This CD is something special, even if you're not from the neighborhood, ese. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006RCSR|5.0|This is such an excellent movie made out of a story that could have been true, if I did not know that Henry II married Catherine de Medici in real life, I would think this had really happened. I particularly like the beginning, when the brothers Grimm visit the Queen of France, who then tells them the story of her greatgreat-grandmother, and isn't Jeanne Moreau phantastic in her role as queen?! <br />What shocked me was that many of the people sending reviews not only named her Gabrielle instead of Danielle, showing they paid little attention do detail, but one even said this was a medieval story happening in Old England! The story, however, is a Renaissance story (when Leonardo da Vinci lived, and lived in Amboise after being invited by the Kind) and the castle you can see in the movie is the castle in Amboise, where King Francis and later King Henri lived in often, if not in Blois, they always talk of Amboise even several times, and the river is the Loire, and a wonderful area it is, suited well for the movie. I love all Cinderella stories because most are just as well for grown-ups, and have much wisdom, this one is even better than the famous Czech movie I think. I can't praise it enough, and I will keep it for rainy days to brighten them.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is not your typical sci-fi series. Firstly, there are no aliens. It envisions a future where there may in fact be nonhuman life, but we haven't found it yet. Secondly, the world is considerably seamier than the airbrushed idyllic utopias so often seen in science fiction shows. All of the main characters are outcasts of some sort or other - they live on the edge and they're proud of the independence it gives them. Thirdly, it comes from the mind of Joss Whedon, the man behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. As you might expect, that means moral dilemmas, witty snarky dialogue, and a show that's never afraid to get emotionally heavy (as long as, y'know, it's okay to be witty and snarky about it).<br /><br />The titular Firefly is a ship, Serenity, owned by survivor of the war of independence - the losing side - Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion). Along with his former subordinate and current first mate Zoe (Gina Torres), he skulks through space trying to avoid the everpresent Alliance. Along the way, he's picked up quite a few fellow misfits: Wash (Alan Tudyk), Zoe's husband and the pilot of Serenity; Jayne (Adam Baldwin), a not-too-bright mercenary with an eye for the main chance; Kaylee (Jewel Staite), the ship's perky mechanic; Book (Ron Glass), a preacher who seems to know an awful lot about guns and the Alliance; and Inara (Morena Baccarin), high-class prostitute and the only vestige of respectability Serenity has.<br /><br />The story begins when two more runaways find their way onboard Serenity: Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his sister River (Summer Glau). They're both on the run from the Alliance, who performed nefarious experiments on River that left her insane, but with certain mysterious skills that soon become apparent. With their arrival - and the discovery that there's very little the Alliance won't do to get River back - the story is thrown into motion.<br /><br />The show is top-notch in just about every aspect - character, dialogue, acting, music, special effects - and quite likely should have done well. However, it was broadcast by Fox, which is infamous for boneheaded programming decisions. In Firefly's case, they started with the second episode and ended with the first episode; showed almost every episode in between out of order; constantly pre-empted it and rescheduled it; and were all too ready to can it. Firefly was dead, with a run of 13 glorious episodes...or was it?<br /><br />Sales of this very DVD boxed set showed that there was indeed an audience for Firefly. And as of this writing, Universal Studios has released a feature film continuation called Serenity, written and directed by Whedon, and it has reached #2 at the box office. This may lead to a sequel, or sequels - I certainly hope so - or it may not. But either way, we've had hours of quality writing and acting thanks to Joss Whedon, and I thank him for that.<br /><br />I highly recommend this DVD boxed set to anyone, period.music, special effects - and quite likely should have done well.

B000089RVX|2.0|I have listened to this cd several times and while it does have its alright moments, most of the cd is given to highly synthesized pop-rock which I abhor. This band has proven to be one of the most mediocre followers of the gothic/ligh-getheseme sound. The splash that it has made in popular music rather proves my point.  <br />It's rather good for those who like Linkin Park and other bands of the sort though. I, unfortunately, was talked into the purchase of this cd. It did not appeal to my tastes but I don't doubt that it could very well appeal to others.
630542828X|5.0|Great, entertaining movie. Those who expect it to be a documentary - or - to follow the book - I guess have no realistic understanding of movie industry. But, this movie does definitely stimulate your thinking. And may make you want to seek further truth about how types of lawsuits are handled. After seeing the movie you might be stimulated to read the book. Look at the cast. Are these second rate actors!? Hardly!
0060872675|2.0|I love Pratchett's work.  I own all of the books he has written or co-written, but have generally avoided the tie-ins that are largely the work of others.  I should have avoided this one too.<br /><br />The text, what there is of it, is almost entirely lifted from \\"Thud!\\" and is a \\"funny once\\" for those familiar with Discworld.  And if you've read \\"Thud!\\" you've read this. But it's the illustrations which ruin this work for me.  Pratchett has tended to avoid detailed physical descriptions of his characters, leaving it to the reader's imagination.  I therefore found it jolting that the depiction of Sam Vimes, in particular, was so completely unlike my own mental image of him. Paul Kidby's illustrations in \\"The Last Hero\\" seemed to fit much better.<br /><br />If you're buying this book thinking it would be good to read to a young child, think again.  It is a book about a children's book, not the book itself.  The illustrations are lavish, and it would appear that there's lots of detail to savor, but the depiction of Sam Vimes as looking like Buzz Lightyear really was a turnoff to me.<br /><br />If you have to own \\"everything Pratchett\\", then go ahead and buy this too.  It's certainly not bad.  But I found it rather unfulfilling.  If you haven't already, buy Pratchett's \\"Once More (With Footnotes)\\" from Amazon.  Now THAT is a worthwhile read!
B000002KMY|3.0|This album came out in november of 1981 as the follow up to the greatest Black Sabbath album ever made, *Heaven and Hell*. I was expecting this to be H&H's twin brother but it ended up sounding like it's 12 year-old nephew. *Mob Rules* is simply not as strong as it's predacesor was. there are some strong   differentiating thoughts about where this album stands in the Black Sabbath discography. It is heavier and darker sounding then H&H, yes, but it is just not as inspiring or original. It sounded to me like they were starting to retrace some of the bands doom/sludge 70s metal ala *Master of Reality* or *Vol 4* in songs like \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\" and \\"Falling of the Edge of the World\\". Don't forget that this album has 4, count em' 4 filler songs as opposed to H&H's 1 filler (Walk Away), these are \\"E5150\\",\\"Country Girl\\", \\"Slipping Away\\" and \\"Over and Over\\". I never find myself playing this CD very often at all, it just sounds like an uninspired follow up to the greatest LP ever made, but i would admit that it is unfair to expect this to be on the same feild as *Heaven and Hell*, as nothing in recorded music is as good as *Heaven and Hell*. However, there are some good songs here, \\"Turn Up the Night\\" is a fun little rocker, \\"SotSC\\" is a doomy 7 minute epic and \\"VooDoo\\" just sounds so evil. <br /> <br />&lt;Turn Up The Night> 7/10 <br />*This is basically a poor mans \\"Neon Knights\\", but it's still a fun song* <br /> <br />&lt;Voodoo> 9/10 <br />*Proves why Iommi is one (if not THE) of the greatest guitar players ever, the riffs on this song just rock!* <br /> <br />&lt;Sign of the Southen Cross> 8/10 <br />*They tried to recreate a \\"Heaven and Hell\\" style epic with this one, it's not nearly as good as that song but it is still great*  <br /> <br />&lt;E5150> 2/10 <br />* Utterly useless, the title is supposed to stand for \\"Evil\\" in roman numerals. Not even a song, just a souless jumble of electronica* <br /> <br />&lt;Mob Rules> 9/10 <br />*Great song, maybe thebest on the whole album, though i hear that the \\"Heavy Metal\\" version of this is supposed to be even better. Very inspired and energetic singing from Dio* <br /> <br />&lt;Country Girl> 4/10 <br />*Nothing more then filler, sounds more akin to ELF then Black Sabbath. Dio is singing what i think to be a love song of some kind, but i don't see where the band was going with this at all* <br /> <br />&lt;Slipping Away> 6/10 <br />* A little bit better then \\"Country Girl\\", still sounds blatantly filler though* <br /> <br />&lt;Falling of the Edge of the World> 8/10 <br />* a very good and underrated song! It opens with doom-metal style guitar riff and then speeds up with frantic singing from Dio* <br /> <br />&lt;Over and Over> 6/10 <br />* Sabbath sounds lazy on this thing, you will wish this song was over as soon as you start listeing to it. They wanted to remake \\"Lonely is the Word\\" i think, but this song falls flat on it's face. The only redeeming quality is Iommi's chaotic soloing at the end* <br /> <br />That's what i think was the problem, they tried to recreate a album that could not be recreated. Some of these songs sound like B-sides to tell the truth, but Mob Rules is still worth 3 stars, it is a decent album.

B00004YKUY|4.0|I'm one of the few Journey fans from New Zealand, and I was REALLY excited to finally hear the new members Steve Augeri and Deen Castronovo.  I'd heard so much about Mr. Augeri before I got to hear \\"Arrival\\", and I've been a fan of Mr. Castronovo for some years (I'm a Drummer too!).  I was not disappointed.  Augeri IS similar to former Lead Singer Steve Perry, but he has his own thing too, and he doesn't hog the limelight like Perry ALWAYS did!  I love how Schon and Cain REALLY get to shine as songwriters now, and that Journey's sound has matured somewhat.  I LOVE \\"Higher Place\\" - I think it's a masterpiece.  If you weren't aware, that's Deen Castronovo singing the high 5th harmony in the middle 8 of that tune!  He's an AMAZING singer as well, as fans are just finding out in force!  \\"Arrival\\" fits in with the Journey heritage, but somehow brings them up to date, with a powerful, clean, fresh sound.  If you're thinking of buying the album, take the plunge...you won't be disappointed!
B00026WU7I|5.0|when i was 20 and stupid the most amazing girl in the world gave me this album for my birthday.  only 30 years later do I realize that this is may be the greatest album ever made.  there is no weakness - not ONE bad song.  These songs are nothing short of amazing...music and lyrics - bob dylan exceeding anything humanly possible.  why discuss good songs and bad on an album where every song is PERFECTION.  its actually stupid to write words to this album.  if you were born without a heart you may not like it.  thats it.  i am done now.
0060527978|3.0|This book reminds me the technique used by sitcoms to pull flashbacks from a whole season of episodes, stick an opening and closing on each end and call it a new show. For that reason, I did not feel it was quite as enjoyable to read as The Alchemist. Stylistically, Alchemist is like an Old Testament narrative where Warrior is like reading Proverbs.  There were, however, some wonderful \\"nuggets\\" of pure gold that I find myself reading over and over - even commiting to memory. It is a worthwhile volume to have and would recommend it to any reader who enjoys Coelho's work.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I felt compelled to write this review, simply because, as some have mentioned, I was rather awed by this performance...and also a bit put-off by some of the other, less accurate reviews. <br /> <br />As a long-time Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker fan, I had seen them together once before (back in 1989, with Jack's then-backing band) and was aware of what they could do together, even after some 20-odd years.  The difference was, though Jack & Ginger's performance was solid, it definitely didn't sound like Cream.  They played White Room, Toad, et als., but without Clapton, it defintely sounded like an 'oldies revival'...a great sound, with distinct original elements, but still 'nothing like the real thing'. <br /> <br />And THAT'S what is so amazing about *this* concert.  These men are alll in their 60s.  None of them play 'psychedelic music' anymore, nor do they play in the style that made them famous.  Ginger's last three solo releases have been a combination of Jazz trio and modern jazz, Bruce's albums have run the gamut from pop/rock, to Latin-flavored and more, and Clapton, well, he's definitely embraced 'old-man blues' more than anything (as opposed to the fiery psychedelic blues of the past)... <br /> <br />But when the three got together to play again, it was indeed, THE CREAM.  No, they don't sound like they did in 1968, not exactly. It's a bit slower, a bit more precise, and a bit more 'older statesman'...but it sounds EVERY BIT like the CREAM, and it's without a doubt performed by 3 gents who (once again) love playing together.  You could hear this from a-far, you could play this to a fan old or new, and they'd say, \\"that's the Cream, isn't it?\\"  Well yes indeed, it is! <br /> <br />As Ginger states in the interviews on this DVD, \\"We're three people who were blessed with the gift of time.\\"  And that's true on many levels.  Their musicianship is as tight as ever; Jack soars, Eric wails (yes, he does), and Ginger's solid, in-the-pocket feeling has lost none of it's vitality.  But aside from the musicality, they're able to step back into a time when their music changed the face of everything to come --- and they do it with utter grace, just like the old days (albeit with the knowledge of 3 men who've been there, done that, and have nothing to prove.) <br /> <br />This is a brilliantly filmed concert documentary of three living legends.  The Cream lives on: in body, in spirit, and most certainly, in music.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I didn't think too much of this movie at the time it was released. Until giving it a chance when it was released on DVD. I watched and surprisingly, I liked it. Disney's Freaky Friday retains it's charms and fits well with the mold of today's drama-filled teen (in this case, Lindsay Lohan, who gives a hilarious role). Jamie Lee Curtis as Tess Coleman delivers a one-of-a-kind performance in this one. One of her best actually. And Chad Michael Murray as Lohan's love interest delivers well. (although the whole cover of Baby One More Time sent me reeling lol) <br /> <br />The soundtrack for the movie is very catchy,too. Simple Plan's cover of \\"So Happy Together\\" kicks off the movie with a bang. This is a good filler for your DVD collection that shouldn't be missed. And if you liked Mean Girls, you'll like this too.

B0009S4IHY|4.0|This movie isn't expected to be taken seriously, but to watch and feast on it's visual charms, and quirky Asian humor. Stephen Chow does a great job pulling you in. The fights are original and exaggerated, which is perfect from the typical fighting found in most action films. The Landlady has to be one of the funny but annoying characters ever. <br /> <br />I gotta say, my expectations for this movie were great, but in some ways I felt let down after watching it. I was expecting more comedy, which started to wane toward the end (pardon if this sounds like a spoiler please). The film might take repeated viewings to grab your interest and get the humor. But it's good for what it is. Gotta love the score for this, too. A worthy buy for sure.
B00001IVOR|5.0|Best Wu-tang clan album in my opinion, I believe this album is better than 36 chamber on so many levels, thats probably because 36 chambers is not from my generation. Disc 1 has some classics, Disc 2 is full of classics.
B000A6T1KE|2.0|Star Trek: Nemesis has the most action of any other film in the series. Now, I loved this film when I first saw it in theaters, before I was a very big fan of Star Trek, but now, after three years, I viewed it again after purchasing the Collector's Edition. Now that I have seen all of the other movies, and plenty of episodes of TOS, TNG, and DS9, I have to judge this installment as inferior. <br />The action in Nemesis is enough to placate non-fans, but the film lacks much substance. The underlying message is not pronounced well enough, dropped in favor of unnecessary action sequences, which also caused the film's creators to cut many scenes, with Rick Berman insisting basically that it was for the best. <br />There are some inconsistencies with previously-established canon and there are some things that are just \\"out there\\". In the finale of Deep Space Nine, we learn Worf is going to become the Klingon ambassador to the Federation, but here he is, becoming a member of the crew. Janeway we find has been promoted thrice in about two years. No mention is made of Data's original brother Lore. The Argo seems created specifically for a chase scene. The emergency transporter device...right. <br />Check out Nemesis if you have the time, but if you are a Star Trek fan, you will be missing very little.
B000002I6V|4.0|A nostalgic trip back to the 70's when I first bought this album on vinyl, which I still have.  Received the album faster than the promised date.
B000002I2I|5.0|The previous album to this is much critisized. But one thing it deserves credit for, is that it spent the Doors, as far as their adventurous needs were concerned, allowing them peace to settle back to their own earth. This album is their earth. They are at their most base here. And at their most tidy. There doesn't seem to be too much effort expended here. This album seems simply to lay right where it fell. It isn't as unique as any of their other albums, I don't believe. But it doesn't need to be. Their individuality is of course present, but upon a more straight forward platform. This album can crawl scarily close to pub rock, but the x-factor always gives it an exceptional charm that would rid a pub of its mundane night's existence, and draw the patrons into feeling how energized the everyday drinks night can feel.<br />The first song, Roadhouse Blues, is ultimate pub fair. Nevertheless, the Doors intensity and the Morrison charisma elevates it beyond being just another tune. Waiting For the Sun is one of my favourites. Somehow, I don't feel it really belongs here. It's too mysterious and a little cerebral. But musically, it does roll with the punches, so doesn't 'sound' out of place. My least favourite song is You Make Me Real. I must admit to feeling this is as commonplace as the Doors have gotten in their career. I don't feel any unique edge, really. Don't get me wrong, Morrison is still a strong presenter on it. But it is one of the few songs that sounds like it could have been done by any number of artists. I suppose I'm setting them high standards in making this statement, but there you have it. Peace Frog is well known by Doors fans as the hit single that never was. Not in so many words, but it is a song that gets more radio play than some of their regular Greatest Hits invitees. I've come across many non-fans who like this song.<br /><br />Blue Sunday is an excellently delivered ballad. It's soft and sweet, and has just enough Doorsian dark brooding to satisfy the fold. I'm a fan. And at this track, Manzarek begins to shine. Nothing complex, by the standards we know him for, anyway, but nevertheless on the mark and interesting enough to draw attention every here and there.<br />The next two songs, Ship of Fools and Land Ho, sound just a touch too similar to one another, I think. But that doesn't bother me too much, especially considering that with many other bands, all songs sound alike. These two are certainly different enough to give me a hit from each of them. I'm not a drug user, so I was slow to catch on, but I remember spinning around as a child deliberately to make myself dizzy. And yes... LAND HO! The couch did indeed feel like it was up in the air and I was falling from the ceiling when rolling off of it. Well, that's my take on the story's catch cry :S I like both these songs. They remind me of wayward pirates.<br />The Spy is a cute little gem. It really is. There's not much layer to it at all. It is typical whiteman(?) blues at its best and most sullen. Easy to enjoy... if you're partial to sulking and brooding.<br />Now, this next song seems to get a bad rap, most especially from the band itself. I'm afraid I'll have to commit mutiny here, my four captains. I really like this song. I much prefer this album version to the one on the box set which the Doors themselves seem to prefer. Admittedly there are short-comings. The chord strikes are probably a bit too abrupt to be perfect, but the rest is smashingly fine. Indian Summer is a perfect pursuit of musical laziness in an exotic environ. The Doors do succeed in matching the music to the image of the initial Americans' way of life. Such a gentle touch by the Doors here has made such lazy work a peaceful piece of eventless exotic drama. Nicely made.<br />The final track, Maggie M'Gill displays Morrison at his utmost negro-bluesman posessed best. His voice is scratchy and deep, and his expression is full of hardcore, ravaged, poverty-stricken soul. I'm notone to make 'value' comparisons between white and black blues singers. I know that stunt to be meaningless. Fortunately society has grown out of it anyhow. Observations, however, are fine with me. And when it comes to summoning an experience beyond your own, true character is required, and Morrison has captured the feel of the black bluesman strickingly well. Basically put, it's like a brilliant Robert Deniro performance in a film. Morrison had an image in his head of all the lives who's music has influenced him so, and he nailed the experience in voice form.<br />In all, a tight, tight, tight performance by the Doors on this album. The drums are as good as usual, and the percussion additions understatedly excellent. The guitaring is nicely harsh and ragged. The organ and piano work is equally understatedly excellent- nice restraint by someone who is allowed to, by talent's decree, go as nuts as he wants. And the singing is superly raw and as expressive as a neon \\"BAR\\" sign. Most of all, they work it into one tight sound and feel, together. Well handled, Doors.arisons between white and black blues singers. I know that stunt to be meaningless. Fortunately society has grown out of it anyhow. Observations, however, are fine with me.

B000A6T1JU|2.0|I find it very hard to believe that this is the version of the film Walter Hill intended.  It sounds more to me like he had this idea of the comic strip shots in his head a couple of times when he was making it, and then discarded it, knowing it wouldn't work.  But when the idea of a Director's Cut DVD came up 25 years later, he probably decided to say, \\"Yes, this was the version I was thinking after all.\\" <br /> <br />When the Warriors first was released in 1979, it was electrifying.  It was a dark gangster film, taking place all night, with a glitzy look.  Underneath this gang movie was a simple, fun comic strip.  What made it so entertaining for me was watching the gangster story on the surface and seeing the comic strip aspect underneath.  Like Star Wars (which was a space adventure on the surface but a western like adventure underneath), the Warriors entertained us with it's combined genres.  Seeing a movie about gangs, with the electric like score, colorful costumes, and well staged action sequences brought out the excitement in us. <br /> <br />This film doesn't need these unnecessary comic strip drawings that have been inserted in the Director's Cut.  These changes make it too obvious it's a comic film.  The gangs are no longer menacing.  The story no longer has suspense.  Maybe I'm being bious because I'm so used to the original version but I just don't see where Walter Hill thinks these additions help. <br /> <br />The other features are entertaining.  I liked the documentary of the making of the films to an extent.  I would have preferred more interviews with some of the other actors though.  When they talked about what a great performance Roger Hill gave as Cyrus, I was waiting to see him interviewed.  Why not some clips to show where these guys are now, like on the Warriors movie website? <br /> <br />Overall, I would say this DVD is not up to par with other Special Editions.
1400032717|3.0|I picked up this book because I am a Special Ed. Teacher and have worked with children with Autism/ Aspberger's among others.  I found the book really had a nice little story, but seemed to drive me a little crazy with all of it's side ramblings.  Now, I do realize this was the point of the book to get you into the way a person's mind with Autism works, but it was rather annoying after a while.  I was actually glad to be done with it so I could move onto something else.  I'm really surprised at how many great reviews this book actually did get.  At least it's short enough to try out and see if you like it...
0060528737|5.0|Abhorsen hammers home an absolutely solid trilogy including the critically acclaimed \\"Sabriel,\\" and \\"Lirael.\\" Abhorsen-in-waiting Lirael must completely the task she set out to do in \\"Lirael.\\" Along with companions Sameth, Mogget, and the Disreputable Dog, Lirael undergoes many ordeals to save the Old Kingdom from a terrible end. Meanwhile, stars of the first book Sabriel and Touchstone deal with a threat growing in the South. Their troubles quickly become overwhelming. <br /> <br />Abhorsen is a fantastic conclusion to a curdling trilogy. I also recommend Shade's Children by the same author.

I think you will find Lirael to be a treat for those who enjoyed Sabriel, and after reading, do read the final book Abhorsen, which is a truly harrowing conclusion to one of the best series' of modern fantasy.

Here you get a glimpse of the real Britney....a young woman balancing out the surreal life of being a superstar, being (naturally) a human being, and falling in love all over again. Britney is very funny.. and it was sweet how Kevin and her fell for each other. This isn't a glamourous, glossy compilation of \\"Britney\\" and her life...this was more of a homemade, rough-draft video...Britney fans can truly appreciate it. I certainly did...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Much more than a western in space.  The 9 characters on this show build relationships that are rarely seen in other sifi shows.  After the 14th episode, you'll looking for more.  Bonus features and comentary helps give you more details on the series, plot points, and fun of developing this series. You'll want to go see Serenity after this series.  I found this series better than Enterprise and most of voyager.  It's right up there with Farscape from my point of view.
B000002OCP|4.0|This CD has recently had a cult following on hip FM stations here in Australia. It is a CD that would go nicely up against Cream, Hendrix or bands such as this.<br /><br />With Muddy's great vocals it's not a bad disc.<br /><br />The only complaint is lack of bonus tracks at 37 min it's too short.

B00006V9A0|2.0|I'm sure the first thing that's going through your mind is, \\"where is 'Aneurysm?'\\"  My thoughts exactly.  This collection makes it easy to complain about what songs were included and what songs were left out.  Why do they give us \\"Been a Son\\" and not Negative Creep?  Why do we have to buy an import for \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\\"  I could go on and on about what was included ant what wasn't, but the point of the matter is that there are only fourteen songs.  I know we've entered the twenty-first century, and our attention spans are almost non-existent, but please give us something for our money. <br /> <br />The track listing makes things awkward as well.  Nirvana's three studio albums have very distinct characteristics, and it would have been difficult for anyone to come up with a best of that had a good flow to it, but sometimes it feels like they didn't even try to make it sound cohesive.  Putting \\"You Know You're Right\\" as the first song feels counter intuitive to say the least. <br /> <br />I know the purpose of the album is to reel in the uninitiated, but it would have been nice for them to add another new song or two for the die-hards.  Nirvana has such a small catalogue, much of it essential, that any Nirvana fan will likely have these songs.  The only exception is \\"You Know You're Right\\" and a new sound mix of \\"Pennyroyal Tea.\\" <br /> <br />If you're already a fan, my suggestion is to make your own Nirvana: Best Of and give it to someone who is thinking about making a purchase.  If you are interested in the band, but have yet to make a purchase, just go out and get Nevermind, In Utero, and Live In New York.  They're all essential for serious music fans.  The other Nirvana albums are good, but mostly just for the die-hards.   <br /> <br />If you really feel like buying the album be my guest.  You can think of it as padding Fracis Bean's college fund. <br />

B00000G3I2|3.0|This movie came out at the right time.  A lot of people in the early '80s were selling the idea that the revolution of the sixties was over, was lost, and that all the sixties \\"radicals\\" had put on coats and ties and gone into white collar jobs.  This movie dramatized that idea, and the public ate it up.   <br /> <br />In fact, the revolution, after some uncertainty in the '70s, had successfully established itself in certain departments of colleges and universities and was just beginning to roll, and strenuous efforts were being made to cover up this fact.  The present movie fit into that campaign (though whether Kasdan knew it or not we may never know.)  The revolution has since spilled out of the universities into broadcasting, publishing and film.  (If you want the full story, read The Rape of Alma Mater.)  There were certainly individuals, much publicized, who fit the \\"big chill\\" image, but they were a minority.   <br /> <br />As to the movie, it really is boring and self-indulgent.  Buy it at your own risk.  I give it three stars because of the quality and performances of the cast.   <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Final Fantasy VII Advent Children its just amazing, even if the story is not the strongest and well structured, the movie looks as great and better as the latest FF series. Im not the biggest fan of the series but i have to say that this is an extremely perfect work. I would love to see a FFVIII movie, wich i cosidere the best game of the whole serie. This is a ten stars rate for the Square and Enix team, the most creative people in the world, im sure of that. So, what are u waiting for?, this is a must seeing movie, should be premiered on cinemas (thats a shame). Bye then!

It becomes obvious that the authors of this book befriended each family and truly got to know them.  That sincerity is what takes this book from simple premise to a work of art.   <br /> <br />The profiles are fast and fun, giving you a colorful and oftentimes humorous sense of each family's daily life surrounding their sustenance.  Recipes are included as a great way to understand and perhaps actually taste an exotic dish. <br /> <br />The statistics are varied and interesting...\\"kangaroos killed under commercial harvest for meat and skins: 3,474,483\\"...but not obtrusive, you get the idea by looking at the pictures alone.   <br /> <br />The spectrum of families covered is striking, from a Sudanese refugee-camp family eating U.N. World Food Programme provided rations to a native Greenland family that eats as much commercially processed food as they do hunted seal meat.  <br /> <br />A perfect book to have in your kitchen...who isn't intrigued by what others are eating? <br />
B00005QG9J|5.0|Alot of people dislike this cd. But I can understand why (in a sense.) S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself were very good, very rock, very funk, just a good blend. This quite simply, is different. It's a mellower side of Incubus, and honestly a very good side. They got it right with this one...although i'll be the first to hate poppy things, and hits left and right, this is an exception. Here we go... <br />1.Nice To Know You 8.5/10...Used to be my favorite incubus song before i really got into them. Overplayed with simply boring verses at times...but the chorus and riff are extremely good. <br />2.Circles 8.5/10...Very cool song. This is a Make Yourself-esque song, very well done..basically an average incubus song though. <br />3.Wish You Were Here 8/10...An incubus classic i have to admit..with amazing lyrics, but this song never grabbed my attention too much. Still good. <br />4.Just A Phase 9/10...Very cool...a very long beginning with brandon humming so to speak, with an acoustic guitar..and this is the ultimate build-up song, when in the end turns into a hard rocker. <br />5.11am 10/10...One of my favorite incubus songs. It's just very emotional and i absolutely love the lyrics and the humming in the background. <br />6.Blood On The Ground 9/10...Alot of people don't like this song and i don't know why. I love it. The lyrics are cool while the song rocks, it changes tempos a good amount of times also..very good. <br />7.Mexico 8.5/10...All acoustic. Good song...get's tiresome, but includes some nice violins. <br />8.Warning 8.5/10...Another hit..but this includes amazing vocals, definitely a classic. <br />9.Echo 7.5/10...Eh..I like the jazzy part but...it's not my favorite, good song though. <br />10.Have You Ever 9/10...Another song alot of people don't like. Again i don't know why. The verses do get annoying fast, but the chorus makes up for it, making this a good short rocker. <br />11.Are You In? 8/10...Another jazz piece..but this one's a tad better than Echo, don't get me wrong they're both good..but not my favorite. <br />12.Under My Umbrella 10/10...Up there with my top 3 favorite incubus songs (Vitamin, Clean) from start to finish this song is amazing...just listen. <br />13.Aqueous Transmission 8.5/10...Incubus' most experimental song to date. SOOO relaxed and really a nice touch, and can't really ask for a better way to end a great cd. <br /> <br />So basically this is just as good as any of Incubus' other stuff. I do recommend.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like most people, when I read the premise of this show, I found it laughable and a pretty throw away show. Just earlier this year, I was introduced to \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\" which I fell in love with, and now consider one of if not my all time favorite show. When I learned the writer of Firefly and Buffy were the same person, I watched the series and fell in love with it. When I learned of the movie, I decided to buy the box set and watch it from beginning to end once more. <br /> <br />This show is not just another throw away sci-fi show. The dialogue and story telling of Joss Whedon is something truly phenomenal. The man knows exactly what he's doing and is a master of character development and story telling.  <br /> <br />I believe this show can be enjoyed by literally everyone. It has characters people can easily identify with and characters you'll fall in love with and really care about. The story telling is magnificent, and even the visuals are quite good. It's no wonder the fan base of this show is so astounding.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm always at a bit of a loss as to how to describe my favorite TV series to others for the first time.  I usually settle for something along the lines of \\"It's a sci-fi space Western action comedy drama that was cancelled halfway through it's first season on TV.\\"  When I see the look of confused shock on their faces it's time to elaborate a bit more.<br /><br />Seriously, Firefly has everything one could ask for in entertainment.  The writing is original and witty.  The humor is wickedly funny, especially as delivered by the incredibly talented and likable cast.  There are moments for every person and every mood.  This is the only show I have ever watched that can both make me laugh out loud and move me to tears, without being cheesy or overdramatic for a second. Everyone I have shown Firefly to has loved it...young or old, male or female.<br /><br />The show is set 500 years in the future, but this is not the sterile future so often portrayed....it has a very human and realistic feel that makes you think this is really what it might be like down the line.  Technological advances and political changes have taken place, but human society is very much the same.  It takes place partly in outer space and on multiple planets, but there are no aliens.<br /><br />The music on the show is unusual and grounds it as an almost down-to-earth story rather than your typical sci-fi fare. I always fast-forward the title credits and theme song on TV shows, but with Firefly I listen to the song and watch the beautifully done credits every time.<br /><br />There are 9 main characters in the show, and by the time you are halfway through the series they will become your second family.  The cast has such incredible chemistry and the writing is so good that it's impossible not to care about them deeply.<br /><br />Look at it this way; for a TV show that was cancelled in the middle of it's first season to not only be amazon's #3 best seller but to have gotten a major motion picture released based on it, it must be something pretty incredible.  It is.ture released based on it, it must be something pretty incredible.  It is.
B00008OLIC|4.0|After going on cruse control for most of the decade, Motley Crue pulled it together for what many would consider to be their masterpiece \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" (1989).<br /><br />Newly clean and focused, for their fifth album, the band tapped Bob Rock (Metallica) to produce their new CD.<br /><br />To many, \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is regarded as the bands finest hour--their crown jewel. And While `Dr. Feelgood\\" certainly has many strengths; it suffers a few drawbacks as well.<br /><br />Musically, \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is probably the band's best work since \\"Shout at the Devil.\\" The band--Vince Neil (vocals), Tommy Lee (drums), Nikki Sixx (Bass) and Mick Mars (Guitar), gave a one hundred percent effort. Unlike the past few records, the band didn't just coast. Their performance and Nikki Sixx's songwriting was top notch.<br /><br />Nikki Sixx penned a great collection of songs, so when the CD is good, it's very good. There is far less filler on \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" then their had been on the Crue's last two albums, \\"Theatre of Pain\\" (1985) and \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" (1987).<br /><br />Some of the band's best work is on \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" like the arena-rock anthems \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" \\"Kickstart My Heart,\\" \\"Same ol' Situation,\\" and \\"Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away).\\"  The album's power ballads \\"Without You\\" and \\"Time for Change\\" are far more effective and memorable than many of the ballads from the Crue's peers during that era. Even the \\"filler\\" songs, (\\"Slice of Your Pie,\\" \\"Rattlesnake Shake, \\"Sticky Sweet,\\" \\"She Goes Down\\") between the big singles are effective and keep up the album's momentum. All in all, it's a thoroughly rocking and memorable album.<br /><br />The album does leave a little to be desired. Even if it is Motley Crue, some of the lyrics, especially \\"She Goes Down\\" are pretty dated and cheesy.  And although \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" contains the band's catchiest collection of songs, the album isn't nearly as edgy or dangerous as the classics \\"Too Fast For Love\\" (1981) and \\"Shout at the Devil\\" (1983). Be that as it may, \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is still one of the best albums from the late `80s pop-metal genre and is sure to please most fans.<br /><br />The bonus material is cool to hear, as it shows the songs in progress. The unreleased track, the mid-tempo \\"Get it for Free\\" sounds like it would have been well suited for the \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" album. It's quite cool and should be of interest to most fans.till one of the best albums from the late `80s pop-metal genre and is sure to please most fans.

B000002UAX|5.0|I lost all my Beatle albums long ago in a move.  I'd hear songs on the radio but never sought to replace my collection.  Finally, after many years, I wanted to buy one CD so I could listen to it in the car.  I looked through the list on Amazon and chose the White Album because I remembered that one was special.  It brought back so many memories.  Our generation was so young, innocent to the point of being silly, and rebellious.  The world is so different now and it's good to remember.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Limp Bizkit's third album; \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" marks both an apex and a turning point in the band's career. While the album did give the band huge commercial success, it also caused a serious backlash. With the release of \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" (2000) it was the beginning of the end.<br /><br />It may be hard to believe now, but when Limp Bizkit first broke through in the late `90s with \\"Three Dollar Bill Y' All\\" (1997) and \\"Significant Other,\\" (1999) they were a pretty cool band. In the late `90s, in the wake of post-grunge, before AOR was saturated with Nu-Metal, Limp Bizkit had something to offer. They had good groves, catchy riffs, infectious sing/rap-along lyrics, and plenty of attitude. Those first two albums may not exactly be timeless classics, but they were cool back in the day.<br /><br />Upon its release in the fall of 2000, \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" shot right to the top of the charts. In late 2000 it was Bizkit Mania. Right before the decline, they were at the zenith of their popularity.<br /><br />For their third release, Limp Bizkit opted for a more MTV/radio friendly sound. As a result, these are the band's catchiest, most assessable songs. Guitarist Wes Borland, the band's most creative member, is reasonable for making the album work. With his creativity and direction, the album is well paced and has a lot to offer-a good mix of metal, pop, and hip-hop. Musically, \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" has more to offer its listener than its predecessors. So at the very least, musically, it's a fun and entertaining album.<br /><br />But alas, we have Fred Durst to contend with. If Limp Bizkit had broken up after \\"Significant Other,\\" Fred Durst would be nowhere near as reviled as he is. Although never a great rapper/singer/frontman, Mr. Durst did a satisfactory job on the first two Limp Bizkit albums. More than anything, his enthusiasm and charisma was his saving grace. On the first two Bizkit albums, although Durst's lyrics were sophomoric, they were something you could relate to.<br /><br />Unfortunately, with \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" the band becomes a parody of themselves with Fred's inane lyrics. From his parody of Nine Inch Nails in \\"Hot Dog\\" (where he uses the \\"F\\" word 500 times), throughout most of the CD, his lyrics are totally idiotic and sophomoric. Unlike the first two Bizkit albums, Fred is no longer the misunderstood underdog. Throughout this CD, Fred Durst comes across as an ignorant, mean-spirited baboon. He reminds me of that 200-pound jock that would punch you in the stomach in the locker room and take your lunch money. Although the worst was yet to come with \\"Results May Vary\\" (2003).<br /><br />The album's highlights and two of the band's best songs are the cool and spacey \\"The One\\" and the forlorn \\"Hold On.\\" On these tracks Durst is far less obnoxious and actually comes across as sincere. He doesn't act like a thug. Scott Weiland's (Stone Temple Pilots, Velvet Revolver) duet with Durst works well on \\"Hold On.\\"<br /><br />Although \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" was a huge hit, it marked the beginning of the end. The album was too huge for the bands own good. They became way overexposed.  Everywhere you'd look you'd see Fred Durst posing all tough and saying stupid things. Later on, his very public infatuation with Brittany Spears didn't help the bands cause. Starting with \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water,\\" the band started to loose all their street-cred.  In the rock community they because an embarrassment. The name \\"Limp Bizkit\\" because synonymous with \\"sucks.\\"<br /><br />Things just got worse and worse for the Bizkit. While a good follow-up album could have redeemed the band, they instead released the awful \\"Results May Vary\\" which sealed the band's fate and torpedoed their career.<br /><br />While the band did make a good EPwith their most recent effort \\"The Unquestionable Truth: Part I,\\" (2005) they have never really recovered from the backlash set upon them by the release of \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are a fan of the first two Limp Bizkit albums, you'll find some value in \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water.\\" Musically, it has a lot to offer. If you can get past Fred Durst's stupidity, you can hopefully still enjoy these songs.art I,\\" (2005) they have never really recovered from the backlash set upon them by the release of \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water.\\"    In conclusion, if you are a fan of the first two Limp Bizkit albums, you'll find some value in \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water.\\" Musically, it has a lot to offer.

B000007MVL|4.0|We all know how high Kate Bush ranks in terms of iconic stature over here in England. Is there anyone above her in terms of respect? Hardly. Her music has become almost a genre unto itself over the years. After her smash hit debut album \\"The Kick Inside,\\" Kate released \\"Lioneart.\\" The album was actually released in the same year as her debut, which was obviously just a record company ploy to capitalise on Kate's new-found success. As a result, this album didn't do as well as her debut, and sold a mere 300,000 copies in the UK. It peaked at No.6 and didn't really spawn any massive hit singles. When stood next to Kate's masterpieces such as \\"Hounds Of Love\\" and \\"The Dreaming,\\" this album doesn't really stand a chance. There are great moments on all of Bush's albums, but this album just so happens to feature the least amount. Or at least that's my opinion.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Symphony In Blue.\\" This is a very classy mid-tempo song and has trademark vocals from Kate, very high and operatic. It's also quite a sexual song and has some rather racy lyrics for 1978! \\"In Search Of Peter Pan\\" is actually one of my least favourites on the album. No matter how many times I listen to it never seems to fully connect with me like most of Kate's music does. The end of the chorus is very beautiful though, and the piano is rather shrill and very harmonious. \\"Wow\\" is one of the best songs I think Kate has ever done. This song runs for four minutes and has one of the most fantastic intros I've ever heard. It's incredibly atmospheric and almost eerie. Kate's vocals are so beautiful and remind me of a starry night. The chorus is amazing as she bursts out singing, \\"Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow! Unbelievable!\\" It ends just as beautifully as it started too.<br /><br />\\"Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake\\" is a fantastic song that has quite a subdued, quiet opening. However, things pick up in the section before the chorus, until Kate is screaming her head off in that chorus! I love it when the guitars kick in as she sings, \\"Come on! You've got to use your flow!\\" \\"Oh England My Lionheart\\" is a very sad song about the war, and is interesting in how this is the only song to feature hand-written lyrics in the inlay, while the rest are simply printed. The chorus is quite impressive as Kate's voice rises. \\"Fullhouse\\" is a rather weak offering, because I feel that the vocals are bit too eccentric on this song. \\"In The Warm Room\\" is a very sensual and erotic song. This worked very fell on Kate's debut album on songs such as \\"L'Amour Looks Something Like You\\" and \\"Feel It.\\" This isn't as good, but it's still a great song. The lyrics become more sensuous as the song progresses, right down to, \\"You'll fall into her like a pillow, her thighs are soft as marshmellows, say hello, to the soft musk of her hollows.\\" Kate's vocals rise and fall to the sweet tenderness of such a beautiful song.<br /><br />\\"Kashka From Baghdad\\" is one of Kate's most famous songs, in which she sings about a gay couple, shunned by their friends and family because of their homosexuality. However, they don't seem to care, as their landlady observes every night as she can hear them laughing and getting along just like any ordinary couple. You can feel the longing for them as a couple in Kate's voice, which was quite risky back in 1978. \\"Coffee Homeground\\" is a song about murder, yet it's supposed to be set in the 19th Century. To achieve this, the song sounds very spacious and cold, like an eerie cellar haunted by ghosts. It's a very British song, and is perfect for expressing Kate's dynamic voice. The album closes with \\"Hammer Horror,\\" another song about murder. In this song, Kate takes on the role of an understudy who plots to kill off the main star in a play so that she can have the part. It's a rather unusual song, very diverse for its time, and ultimately very rewarding.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 8/10<br /><br />This is probably my least favourite Kate Bush album, but that's only because after this she went on to release some real masterpieces. Infact, the three albums that came after this are all stunning and 10 times better than this album. Lionheart is probably more famous for the album artwork than the actual songs, which is quite a shame, but some people saw this as a poor rehash of her more successful debut album. The best song on here for me is Wow and probably always will be. However, this is still an essential addition to any Kate Bush fan's collection.but that's only because after this she went on to release some real masterpieces.

B000006MS3|5.0|When I bought four Kate Bush albums a month ago, the one I was most intrigued by was \\"The Dreaming.\\" I had read how this was a work of uncalculated genius that sadly went unnoticed when released in 1982. How very true. It took a few listens for this album to really grow on me, but it has done in a way I never would have thought possible. This album has 10 songs of solid art. It even threatened to overtake \\"Hounds Of Love\\" as my favourite Kate Bush album, and that is something I thought would never happen! This is Kate's most experimental and complex album, yet it still has catchy melodies and memorable lyrics all the way through. Not once does the album lag. It is a solid album that most artists could only dream of producing.<br /><br />And that's just the thing: producing. Kate Bush near-as-damn-it created this whole album on her own with no help. There are so many hidden meanings and different ways that this album can be interpreted, it's really quite breathtaking. There's nothing here that you can really dance to, and no real ballad-heavy patches. The album sits somewhere inbetween with disjointed piano sections, disjointed vocals and gloomy lyrics. The album manages to achieve a perfect balance on all aspects of what makes a superb concept album. Kate Bush is a true innovator and experimentalist, which in my eyes, is the most talented kind of musician around.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Sat In Your Lap.\\" No, this isn't a seedy song about a strip club that many manufactured singers would release to sell their album. Kate wasn't interested in having big hits from this album. This song opens in a flurry of drum beats and jilted piano riffs. It's a song about the search for knowledge and how to expand your mind, but from the perspective from someone who thinks it is just sat in their lap and that they don't have to do any searching for it. It's a frankly brilliant opener in which our protagonist finally goes on a big search at the end of the song - across the desert, across the weather, across the elements, across the water. \\"There Goes A Tenner\\" is about a botched robbery. The song has a bouncy quality to it and has cinematic breaks in it in which synths slow things down during the chorus as Kate whispers, \\"We're waiting.\\" She puts on a superb British accent and the song contains many superb lines such as, \\"I hope you remember to treat the gelignite tenderly!\\" Kate's having dreams about things not going right, so tells her partners in crime to leave in plenty of time tonight.<br /><br />\\"Pull Out The Pin\\" suddenly sees Kate thrown into the Vietnamese outback during the war of the Seventies. This song has a fantastic beat that sounds like a solid block of wood being tapped for melodic qualities. The song is sonically superb and lyrically profound for its time. She manages to capture the sheer desperation of someone fighting for their life in the war, \\"You learn to ride the Earth, when you're living on your belly.\\" \\"Suspended In Gaffa\\" is one of the more instantly accessible songs upon first listening to this album. This song has a very waltz-like, marching band quality to it. The lyrics are incredibly complex and incoherent in places, and I don't anyone will truly be able to decipher them. That is, unless Kate releases a dictionary that includes every meaning of the subject matter in her songs! \\"Leave It Open\\" is one of my favourite songs on the album. It's not very long, but it makes a damn big impact. It has a drum beat that is very catchy and vocals that are all over the place, very distorted. I'm not really sure what this song is about, but the lyrics are amazing, \\"I kept it in a cage, watched it weeping, but I made it stay.\\" The song just explodes after the second minute as more drums come pounding in and rip the whole place up! The loud screeches are phenomenal, as are the ghost-like voices being rewinded right at the end.<br /><br />The title-track, \\"The Dreaming,\\" follows. I wasn't too keen on this song to begin with but now it's gone on to become one of my favourites. Kate is suddenly out in the Australian desert singing about how white man has exploited native Aboriginal tribes over the years. It's a very powerful song, and the lyrics are brilliant. Nobody can forget the opening line of, \\"Bang! Goes another kanga on the bonnet of the van!\\" Rolf Harris also plays digeridu on this song, and the drum beat that gently constructs the entire song is just superb. You could just imagine Kate emerging from the Australian bush in a grass skirt with a tribe dancing like nutters to this song. Very visual. \\"Night Of The Swallow\\" has been interpreted many ways by reviewers, with everything from helping a convict escape the country in the dead of the night to a mysterious espionage adventure. The chorus is incredible as Celtic Uillean pipes come in to add an Irish feel. The lyrics are amazing and the noises of swallows in the verses are incredibly atmospheric of some foreign country on the coast. This is one of the longest songs on the album, though, and I feel that it does drag on a bit towards the end.<br /><br />\\"All The Love\\" is an incredible work of art and one of my favourites on the album. This song is about death and how people need love to feel important. It opens with Kate crying, \\"The first time I died, was in the arms of good friends of mine. They kissed me with tears, they hadn't been near me for years.\\" This song is very dry and dusty, almost like the imagery from \\"Egypt\\" from Kate's album previous to this. The best part of the song is the refrain where the choirboy sings, \\"We needed you to love us too, we wait for you more.\\" This is an incredibly beautiful section that requires closed eyes and an open mind to fully interpret it. The chorus follows this in stunning fashion as Kate sings as though she were her friends, \\"All the love, all the love, all the love we could have given.\\" She sings of leaving a message on her answer machine because she can't speak to them. Her message is the choirboy's call, and her friends reply with a barrage of haunting and eerie goodbyes.<br /><br />\\"Houdini\\" is an amazing song but took quite a while to really grow on me. In this song Kate takes on the role of Rosabel, the escape artist Houdini's wife. She is trying to contact him through a seance. Can he escape even this seance? We doubt it, as Kate sings, \\"Not even eternity can hold Houdini,\\" suggesting contact was more. The song is almost like a candle-lit ballad which is very soft on the ears. The verses are subdued and the section after the chorus is a lush, orchestral arrangement with some very smooth strings. The chorus is absolutely stunning as Kate screams, \\"With your spit, still on my lips, you hit the water!\\" The nearest visual aid we can get from this song is by looking at the cover of the album. Houdini's face is covered, but we can see a large padlock around him. Kate, obviously playing Rosabel, is moving in for a kiss, but has the key for the lock on her tongue. Her eyes are looking far in the distance, when she should be focused on his eyes.<br /><br />The album closes with the stunning \\"Get Out Of My House.\\" This song opens with a strange noises that sounds like slipping back into a dream, before frantic drums kick in. This is a very scary song about violence and rape in a relationship, in which Kate screams \\"Get out of my house!\\" She's obviously using her house as a metaphor for something else, saying that her house is full of mistakes, madness, and mess. I'm always humoured by Kate's French accent in the section where she whispers, \\"I am the concierge, chez-moi honey. Won't letcha in for love nor money!\\" She sings of now being well protected, barred and bolted, and that no one is getting in her house, and that if they try, something ugly will happen. We can assume that something, indeed, did happen as Kate turns into a mule and starts braying! The strange donkey noises are incredibly haunting, viscous and savage. A superb ending to oneof the best albums ever made.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />There are 10 solid songs on this album, as I have previous stated. I honestly have trouble finding the best one. Every single song ranges from great to absolutely amazing. Kate Bush is an underrated genius and America should have cottoned on. Since that never happened, she will go down as one of the biggest talents Britain has ever produced. Her career has spanned almost three decades, and with the release of her new album \\"Aerial\\" in November, a whole new generation will be introduced to Bush, and her unique style. Hounds Of Love is still her best album in my own humble opinion, but The Dreaming comes a very close second, snapping and biting at Hounds' heels with all it frenetic, insane and unashamed glory.iends reply with a barrage of haunting and eerie goodbyes.     \\"Houdini\\" is an amazing song but took quite a while to really grow on me.

B00004XQP4|5.0|Some people don't like this album because it sounds so different from the usual Green Day, but I love it! I think that this album only proves that Green Day isn't afraid to try new things, and they don't care if anyone likes it or not. Green Day has definitely matured here, but I can tell that some of their old humor is still here, only it's more subtle.  <br />Many find the title track \\"Warning\\" to be weird, or they just don't like it, but I think it's kind of nice to see what Green Day can do when they put down the electric guitar and pick the acoustic. That's kind of what this album is all about. Blood, sex, and booze has a great beat to it, and castaway is very catchy. I found Misery to be surprisingly cool, seeing as it's more of a polka song than anything, but again this only shows how Green Day can put out any kind of music they want and rock at it. Deadbeat Holiday is very catchy, and I can never go with just listening to it once. But the real highlight of this album, I think, is Minority. It shows the band's attitude towards authority, and is the #1 catchiest song in the history of the world. You just HAVE to sing along with it. All of these songs are extremely catchy, and I think that anybody who likes good music should pick this up.
B00000DQSS|5.0|The third album that Kate Bush recorded, \\"Never For Ever\\" was released in September 1980 and contains many of her greatest moments. After her stunning debut \\"The Kick Inside\\" and its follow-up, \\"Lionheart,\\" which didn't perform as well, Kate returned with this album. It went straight to No.1 in the UK and became the first album by a female artist ever to top the charts. This is quite an achievement, and one of many in Kate's phenomenal career as one of the most unique and original talents ever discovered. The album contains 11 songs and still holds up very well more than 25 years after its original release.<br /><br />The album is very diverse, yet it has this smooth, cohesive quality to it that makes it stunningly beautiful and very advanced for the time it was released. Most artists making albums at this period in time were only interested in big sales through writing radio hits. Not Kate. She was way ahead of her time, making music on her own terms and in her own time. This is something Kate has maintained throughout her entire career, and something she should be very proud of. She is a national treasure and by far the best British female artist of all time. Her music was ground breaking for its time and this is representative mostly on \\"The Dreaming\\" and \\"Hounds Of Love,\\" and also, but to a lesser extent, Never For Ever.<br /><br />The album opens with the classic hit single \\"Babooshka.\\" This song is just crazy and very out of control. In this song, Kate sings about disguising herself as an anonymous female who writes letters to her husband to test his fidelity. In the letters, she arranges to meet him dressed in a disguise. The lyrics are dramatic and funny, quite theatrical and very original. The chorus explodes with eccentric vocals in the only way Kate knows how. \\"Delius (Song Of Summer)\\" emerges from the glass-shattering outro of the last song, with a very exotic sitar playing gently. The percussion on this song is very harmonious and Kate's wails are so beautiful it hurts. The song doesn't even stretch to three minutes, but it's very memorable as one of the most peaceful songs Kate has ever recorded. \\"Blow Away (For Bill)\\" has a gorgeous string section that builds as the chorus approaches. The song is about rock and pop stars who tragically died before their time was up. Kate's vocals are high and gorgeous as usual, with the breakdown in the middle being a particular highlight. There's also an Othello reference too. See if you can work out where it is. \\"All We Ever Look For\\" features an array of unusual instruments such as a koto and timpani. This song has an Irish feel to it every time I listen to it. It's a whistle-like riff that builds as the song progresses. The song is about parents and children and the relationships we tend to have.<br /><br />\\"Egypt\\" is a song often panned by fans, but I actually really like it. It's incredibly atmospheric, and remember that this is a quarter of a century old. The technology wasn't very advanced back in 1980, so for this song to sound spot-on like the sandy dunes of Egypt is pure genius. The choir-like vocals that build and build in the final two minutes are dry like a desert, the instrumental section is bright like the sun beating down, Kate's piercing scream at 2:19 that echoes, does so *like* a sandstorm over the pyramids. I could go on with all these references, but I won't. You have to listen to it for yourself. Very beautiful. \\"The Wedding List\\" tells the story of a psychotic, disturbed woman who is planning to kill off the attendees at a wedding. She's compiled a list, and lyrics such as \\"I'm gonna fill your head with lead\\" are purely chilling! This is contrasted with the hilariously manic \\"Violin.\\" This is the most over the top song on an otherwise chilled-out album. Kate's vocals on this song rise and fall in an attempt to imitate a violin. I have to say she does a very good job! The lyrics are absolutely hilarious: \\"Get the Bow going! Let it scream to me! Violin, violin, violin!\\" It's almost as though Kate has no control over her voice, especially towards the end where she's screeching, \\"Jiggling along with the fiddle-dee-diddle-dee-dee!\\"<br /><br />\\"The Infant Kiss\\" is another amazing song and has perhaps the most beautiful first verse of any song on the whole album. My heart just flutters when Kate sings, \\"I say goodnight - night, I tuck him in tight.\\" It's just the way she sings it that gets me every time. Pure genius. The rest of the lyrics are quite strange and abstract, yet still an enjoyable listen. \\"Night Scented Stock\\" is a 51-second-long interlude song that just features some breathy vocals. \\"Army Dreamers\\" is a short but very impressionable song about a man who died so young in the army. This is Kate's anti-army/war song and it works very well. The chorus is very memorable and lives on. The album closes with the chilling \\"Breathing.\\" Kate sings this song from the point of view of a baby inside its mother's womb. A nuclear explosion has destroyed the outside world, and the baby's mother is breathing in the deadly toxins, which in turn are damaging the unborn baby. There's a very strong message in this song, sung through an unborn child which Kate's child-like vocals suit very well.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />This album is almost like the ultimate album, because it has so much to offer. The artwork is absolutely stunning, with an image of Kate on the cover stood on a rock as her dress billows out, revealing a sea of animals and mythological creatures. The sound of this album is very clean and pristine which is surprising after 25 years. Not many albums from the Eighties stand up well today, but Kate Bush is a clear exception. The fact that this isn't even her best album is a testament to just how talented a lady she is. Her new album \\"Aerial\\" is released on November 8th after a 12 year wait, and I for one will be buying it straight away. In the mean time we can take a listen back over Kate's lengthy career and see just why she's become such an icon of almost mythical stature in the United Kingdom.olin, violin, violin!\\" It's almost as though Kate has no control over her voice, especially towards the end where she's screeching, \\"Jiggling along with the fiddle-dee-diddle-dee-dee!\\"  <br /> <br />\\"The Infant Kiss\\" is another amazing song and has perhaps the most beautiful first verse of any song on the whole album.

B00005V3Z4|2.0|I rented this film recently because of all the \\"cult hype\\" I had heard regarding this feature. I was disappointed to say the least.  The actors really carry this film, doing their best with what little plot there is to it.  Some might say that I just didn't get the film, but I think the weaknesses, especially the expected ending, support my argument. Several scenes were just over the top in a way that didn't appear realistic. It just seemed like a film that promised a lot, but couldn't deliver.  Did this film make me think?  Sure, it made me think that this film really didn't have a whole lot going for it.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|We love the OC.  I am forty years old and never miss an episode!  Bought this set as a birthday present for my friend's daughter... But secretly I wish it were for me.  We loved the \\"out-takes.\\"  It's a lot of fun watching actors make mistakes.  It shows they are human.  We have bought every sound track and both prior dvd season sets!  We watch during the summer so we don't miss a week of the O.C!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Pulling this, or even beyond that, fiddling with the 2 hour pilot as Joss had planned it was the biggest mistake Fox ever made, they could have had a hit the likes of Lost on thier hands, but theyd rather keep supplying the standard drivel. <br />but i digress, this is the same smart,dramatic,funny, poignant material youve come to expect from Joss, worth every penny, and for those of you who have not had the pleasure yet, here is a review of the movie SERENITY from the first person i convinced to see the movie...Note: he has NEVER seen one episode of the series, I envy him going back and falling in love with the characters from the beggining now!...the review: \\"saw Serenity today... I believe \\"f#@%$ing awesome\\" is the closest I can get to describing it with words without going into hand gestures and starship flight noises\\"  so this is not just a movie for fans of firefly, but anyone, but Firefly fans will leave satisfied, yet wanting more. SEE IT! \\"I'm a leaf on the wind, see how i soar\\"
B0009S3HI0|5.0|IF YOUR A FAN OF THE DEFTONES U GOTTA LOVE THIS TREAT! GOTTA SY THE ONLY TRICK IS NOT HAVIN SAY IT AINT SO LIVE ON THE CD!!<br /><br />LOVE HAVING 2 DURAN DURAN SONGS ON THE DISC- NIGHT BOAT AND THE CHAUFFEUR!!
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This is actually the first album I've listened to from DCFC, but it has already got me hooked. I had heard of them but never had gotten around to listening to them until Plans came out. The album itself is exquisitely done, light tones, snare drums, and harmonics galore. It really is quite amazing. (Sorry for not nowing band members names but...)The singer has such a ghostly voice that rings through the songs like a siren ( the greek mythological kind....not the oh my god I'm in the back of a police car.) The best thing about this band is I can see them stretching across broad spaces, if you like rock, its in here, if you like acoustics, they are in here. Overall its a breath of frsh air and a five out of five for me.
B00005M91K|3.0|Like most reviewers here, I liked the film for its beauty,and obviously the effort that has gone into each frame. But if we still believe in the content VS style debate, the message that the movie conveys is something that I dont agree with. The glorification of tribal over city life with cityfolk compared to mechanical assembly line productions and hapless chickens, whereas tribalfolk are full of energy and celebration. Havnt we overgrown this simplistic binary yet? The linear progression of serene forest-cold factory-lifeless cemetries-bombs etc etc. could have been rethought.
B000646MNE|5.0|It is totally worth it to buy the Sex in the City Series <br />all in one package. <br /> <br />The series itself is amazing and worthy of viewing more than once.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show was a joy. Apparently it was too intelligent for FOX. Sorry it wasn't a clone of \\"Beverly hills, 90210\\" like \\"the O.C.\\" <br />One can only hope that with all the fan support the show still gets, the executives are kicking themselves. And if they are and their legs are starting to get tired, I know quite a few million browncoats that'd be happy to help them out.
1580086810|5.0|As a huge fan of Peter Menzel's works, I preordered this book and was incredibly excited for its arrival. Not only was the photography and descriptions of the families brilliant, but Menzel included excerpts from leading nutritionists, scientists, environmentalists, and my own personal heroes among them Michael Pollen. I especially enjoyed the articles entitled Diabesity and Slow Foods. Another brilliant aspect is the pertinent facts about the countries that the familes come from, which include not only geographics, population density, and life expectancies but also number of McDonald's, the % of obese and overweight, and the consumption of alcohol and cigarettes.<br /><br />Menzel and D'Alusio were also keen to write personal experiences in the countries they visited- the shock of seeing Ramen noodles in Papua New Guinea, or eating dugo (my aunt's personal favorite) congealed swine blood in Manilla. Their facts, and photography, along with their personal experiences opened my awareness to many different cultures as did the first 4 books that they have collaborated on before this.<br /><br />Well done once again
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Death Cab for Cutie (DCFC) is the only relevant American band on the map today and Plans is a testament to that. Much like their British and European counterparts, DCFC delivers melodic, catchy tunes with beautiful and interesting lyrics. They truly embody indie rock the way R.E.M did back in the 80's. DCFC's forte, however, lies in its unmatched ability to make heartache palpable.<br /><br />Plans is a classic DCFC record full of mid-temp songs about relationships. Unlike the popular Transatlanticism, Plans tells more happier stories about relationships :-)<br /><br />The albums starts with Marching Bands of Manhattan--a great, uplifting song with the addictive chorus:<br /><br />  Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole<br /><br />  just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound<br /><br />  But while you debate half empty or half full<br /><br />  It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown<br /><br />Absolutely love it!<br /><br />Then comes my favorite track on the album, Soul Meets Body. It's catchy, well-written and beautifully sung. The Postal Service fans, this one is for you! How can't you love Ben Gibbard singing:<br /><br />  I do believe it's true that there are roads left in both of our shoes<br /><br />  But if the silence takes you then I hope it takes me too<br /><br />  So brown eyes I hold you near cause you're the only song I want to hear<br /><br />  a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere<br /><br />It's raw emotions they sing and that's why I love this band!<br /><br />I love all the songs on this album with Marching Bands and Soul Meets Body being my favorites. The ballad I Will Follow You Into the Dark is a beautiful love song that sounds like it just popped out of Transatlanticism. Other noteworthy tracks are Crooked Teeth, What Sarah Said and Stable Song (love this one too!)<br /><br />Plans is a must have for all indie rock lovers out there. It's an album you'll be singing along to and instantly getting addicted to as well.<br /><br />Get it!ly getting addicted to as well. <br /> <br />Get it!
B0002CHQWG|5.0|This is probably along with \\"Blood...Tracks\\" my favourite Dylan album.  I know everyone gushes over \\"Blonde...\\" and \\"Highway 61...\\" which are classics, but still, this album seems to have a nice flow and to put across what Bob had to say succinctly and yet effectively.  The classic \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" is here and yet every track is a work of art to be listened to and savoured over and over again.  This particular version from Japan has been very well remastered and the mini-lp packaging is very nice to look at as well.  Overall, a very good sound quality recording and great packaging.  Highly recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is incredible!  If you can imagine what a Star Wars movie centered on Han Solo would be like, crossed with Mad Max, the Matrix, and maybe some Clint Eastwood, you might get the picture.
B000B5XOXY|3.0|When I heard Tim Burton and Michael Keaton are not returning, I said this film is in trouble. When I heard Joel Schumacher was gonna direct this, I said maybe it's gonna be excellent since he did a great job with The Lost Boys and Falling Down. Then, when I heard that Val Kilmer is gonna play Batman, Jim Carrey is playing The Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones was play Two-Face, I said this definitley could be good. <br /> <br />When I finally saw it, it wasn't all that, just entertaining. This film is less dark, too comedic and has a lot of dumb scenes. Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor, but his performance as Two-Face was a joke. This isn't Two-Face, since when does he clown around and acts like he has only one personality? I prefer the Two-Face in the animated series back in 1992. Jim Carrey was good as The Riddler, but he doesn't make me say he's better than Frank Gorshin.  <br /> <br />Val Kilmer as Batman was ok, but not good. Chris O' Donnell as Robin was ok too. Nicole Kidman plays Bruce's new girlfriend Chase Miridian, good actress she is, but this character was plain. <br /> <br />Gotham City looks like Fire Island, too much light and colors. Joel Schumacher was a wrong pick to direct this film, and Akiva Goldsman was a wrong pick to write it. The film does have some good scenes and it isn't boring. It's entertaining...but nothing more.
B00008EY7H|1.0|The show is excellent but the image on this DVD is terrible. With the technology that we have right now on DVDs, this looks like from decades ago. It is not recorder clear and the movement of the cameras do not let enjoy de great performances. Spend your money in La Nouba or Varekai DVD.
B00000JQFM|5.0|This album changed my perspective on music, it opened new doors to my guitar playing and made me a more creative song writer, every track on this album is worth listening to if you are heavily into instrumental rock, this is Satch's breakthrough album, tracks like \\"Surfing with the Alien\\", \\"Ice 9\\", \\"Satch Boogie\\", and \\"Crushing Day\\" give you an uplifting attitude and inspire you to start playing guitar. I recommend this album greatly, because it says so much and its just nice to listen to, its an album that you can play over and over again.
B00006LLLN|5.0|This Alison Krauss & Union Station CD is really very good. The song selection was pleasing and gave attention to each performer of the group.  <br />I'm glad I purchased it and would highly recommend it. It enhances my blue-grass collection.
1401206905|4.0|This was amazing.  It flawlessly told the origin of the Batman.  The retro style artwork lent perfectly to the book. The only problem is that they \\"introduce\\" joker at the end of the book, and completly leave out the red hood.
B00000ILDF|4.0|I DO AGREE WITH THE PERSON WHO SAID THAT THE SERIES WASN'T DONE IN CORRECT ORDER; AS A WOMAN, I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LITTLE GIRL. IT WAS GREAT THAT RIPLEY WAS WILLING TO GIVE UP HER LIFE TO ELIMINATE THE QUEEN INSIDE HER. SHOWED ALOT OF COURAGE. ANYHOW, I LIKED THE MOVIE VERY MUCH!!!!!!!
B000A0GP0Y|1.0|Just to start off I like Adam Sandler fan of his for years ever since SNL.With that said this is by far the worst Adam Sandler Movie ever.It's a horrible remake,lame jokes very boring.And what makes it even worst they kill Chris Rock off thats just a downer their.
B00007AJGH|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was a little girl, and now I have a new appreciation for it's revolutionary effects in the animation realm of film-making. Finding it on DVD for such a good price and with SO many extra featurs was pretty sweet. It belongs in most collections.
B0000028VT|4.0|Some would argue that this CD is Mariah's best.  Others would argue this CD is awful.  This CD was good, but not as good as Daydream.  It could have been.  It started off as an amazing CD with number 1s \\"Dreamlover\\" and Hero, and the underrated \\"Anytime You Need a Friend.\\"  But there were some not so good things about this CD that makes it overall good and not great.  \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" was a desperate attempt at \\"I Will Always Love You\\" by Whitney Houston.  It sounds like a filler track as does \\"Never Forget You\\" and \\"I've Been Thinking About You.\\"  These three mediorcre songs plus the three amazing songs that started the CD, average to make a good CD. I suggest you buy the CD for two reasons.  One, the first three songs are so good.  Two, it's probably cheaper to buy the CD, than the first three singles.
630542845X|2.0|Seeing this movie for the first time was awe-inspiring. I thought I had to own it, but in actuality, the acting, writing, and screenplay isn't as great as I remember it being. This edition is super lame,too; lacks features and doesn't even have any previews. At least it's cheap...
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This is truly television at its finest. I'd never seen the show before watching the first season on dvd, and I must say that I've been missing out. This show is one of three shows that has ever touched my heart - along with Joan of Arcadia and American Dreams. It has substance to it, lessons that are taught, and a wonderful cast that makes this show one of the most convincingly true to life and heartfelt shows ever to grace tv screens. I really hope that the second season comes to dvd soon because it's been a year since the first season's release.
B000001GXI|4.0|This set has great things working in it's favor, but it also has many irritating negative aspects.  I've noticed that most reviews debate back and forth the merits of the cast, and I'd like to weigh in on this.  As with much else on this recording, there are plusses and minuses.  Comparing to Klemperer's classic recording, Wunderlich is truly in a class by himself as Tamino, outdoing Gedda's rather colorless (if vocally beautiful) reading in almost every aspect.  Fischer-Dieskau is really remarkable as Papageno, a role he dearly loved, playing him more as an innocent child of nature versus Berry's tragic clown.  Which interpretation you prefer is of course a matter of taste, but personally I think Fi-Di's vision is closer to Mozart's.  Also, Hotter is unforgetable as the Speaker, with the exchange in Act One playing as the classic archetype of impetuous youth facing off against the serene wisdom of old age more clearly than I have heard anywhere else.  On the other hand, Lear is so far outclassed by the blessed Gundula Janowitz it's almost painful.  Janowitz plays Pamina as frail and beautiful as a flower, almost crushed by the machinations around her, whereas Lear seems uncertain of herself in the role; also she lacks the sheer beauty of voice that Janowitz posses to such a remarkable degree that I find myself wondering why Tamino falls in love with her.  In addition, Peters is so painfully stretched in her role as the Queen of the Night that's it's obvious it's not an interpretive choice, but the simple inability of her to play the role which is navigated by Popp with ease.  As far as the conducting, Bohm is his sensible self here, pacing the opera very theatrically.  There's nothing that can really be said against his conducting, but not that much that can be said for it either.  On the other hand, Klemperer makes the controversial choice of seeing this as essentially abstract music, which works quite well for him as he clearly loved every single note of the work.  I don't see either interpretive choice as the ideal.  Those who have seen my more recent reviews won't be surprised when I say that I consider Furtwangler's vision for this work to be ideal.  He sees the work as universal drama, not merely as theatre as Bohm seems to see it.  Furtwangler carefully contemplated the meaning of every scene, every phrase, even every note within the context of the whole opera, and this insight and loving attention to detail shows.  To conclude, if you want a deeply moving account in good sound with a cast that ranges from good to excellent, I highly recommend the Klemperer, whereas if you are looking for a cathartic, visionary experience and can tolerate mediocre sound and somewhat uneven singing, Furtwangler's recording is probably the best.  If for some reason you want a theatrical experience without much drama, and are willing to tolerate singing that occupies the full range from extraordinary to atrocious, you'll probably be happy with this set.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Being a big fan of the movie, and an even bigger fan of the soundtrack.  This was a must have for my music collection.
B000AL730O|5.0|...and this album is one of Paul's absolute best! Starting out with the first track.. Fine Line. Deffinetly being one of the strongest tracks on the album, the song brings home a certain rhythm and feeling of warmth and comfort. \\"Come home brother, all is forgiven! We all cried when you were driven away, come home brother, everything is better, everything is better when you come home to stay..\\" This line certainly affects many that are fighting overseas now, and it brings a smile, and tears to my eyes every time I hear it. Paul really does care about the world and shows it in this song. Jenny Wren the new Blackbird... a true classic. Like so many girls.. Jenny Wren could sing.. yes! a deffinite classic.. the way the tune flows, the way the notes go one after the other on the guitar, it turns into a magical mystery tune.. sounds even better live! Peradventure English Tea is one of the best songs on the album.. describes a magical day in the British countryside.. it really takes you away. Other highlights of the album are Follow Me and Anyways.. two awesome songs. The entire album is a soft, soothing piece of art... a deffinite must-buy. <br /> <br />THERE IS A FINE LINE BETWEEN CHAOS AND CREATION ITS ABOUT TIME YOU UNDERSTOOD WHICH ROAD TO TAKE, ITS A FINE LINE YOUR DECISION MAKES IT DIFFERENT GET IT WRONG YOULL BE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.. COME HOME BROTHER ALL IS FORGIVEN WE ALL CRIED WHEN YOU WERE DRIVEN AWAY COME HOME BROTHER EVERYTHING IS BETTER EVERYTHING IS BETTER WHEN YOU COME HOME TO STAY... ITS A FINE LINE
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I must start this review by saying I am a \\"Phan\\". This is geek code for fans of the Phantom of the Opera. I 1st saw Phantom when I was in the 7th grade in Los Angeles. I later received the soundtrack on tape, and spent many many nights falling asleep to The Music of the Night. It is beautiful story set to gorgeous music.<br /><br />Let's get a few more things out of the way. I never believed that the Phantom role exists only in Michael Crawford. Gerard Butler does a smash up job as the masked man. What he lacks in vocal range he more than makes up in acting ability. He ain't to hard to look at either. Is there really any woman who could say no the Phantom after the Point of no Return sequence? Emmy Rossum was perfect as Christine. She especially embodied the innocence that Christine is made of.<br /><br />Let's talk changes:<br /><br />1. The chandelier falls at the end of Don Juan instead of at the end of All I ask of You. Verdict: A necessary change since the movie does not have an intermission. In the play it would not work. The film... Yes.<br /><br />2. The swordfight: the best change between the film and play. In the play the Phantom shoots a \\"fireball\\"? from his staff at Raoul and Christine. The film changed this up with a rousing swordfight, that also greatly adds to Raoul's character development. I always felt we was way to wussified in the play and wondered why Christine even would want him in the 1st place. Verdict... Awesome<br /><br />3. The Phantom's origins: The play makes no mention of how the Phantom came to be in the Opera. We know that Madame Giry knows more than she should. The film goes into great detail of how The phantom was in a circus freak show and was rescued by Giry. It is not a necessary scene to the story, but does not detract from the flow, and does add more sympathy to the Phantom. Verdict... unnecessary, but not an issue.<br /><br />4. Raol and the water trap: In the play Raol makes his way to the Phantom's lair through the underground labyrinth with water. In the film he falls through a trap door into the water as a cage descends upon him. The only negative to this scene is it breaks the tension of the Phantom and Christine. Once again it no t needed but adds a bit more dramatic tension to Raol's character, even though everyone should know he'll get out somehow. It would have been impossible in the play. Verdict... same as above.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, fun filled, moving movie. The music has never sounded better, the staging is phenomenal, and the performances are dramatic and over the top, like any good musical should be. This is hands down the best movie musical since The Sound of Music. Cower Chicago and Moulin Rouge, the Phantom owns you all!<br /><br />*****/ A+through the underground labyrinth with water.

B0002Z0EYK|4.0|This movie is probably the most inaccurate film on the face of this planet.  The acting is pretty good, the story of the Trojan War is perhaps the greatest war that ever happened.  But I just didn't get the sense that it was a ten year war.  Agamemnon is not supposed to die at Troy, Paris dies, Achilles dies outside Troy, Ajax dies after Achilles, the Gods are huge in the story, the Greeks go after Helen b/c of a pact and not revenge.  But all of these are the exact opposite of what happens in the movie.  The battle scenes are amazing I think but it just wasn't all true.  I watch this movie over and over not because of how accurate it is but because of the time and era that it reminds me of.  If you want a historical film this is not for you.  But if you want a good action flick that reminds you of a time long past than this is for you.
B00070DK5K|5.0|This was always one of my favourite concert albums. The orginal cd version wasn't bad but always seemed lacking a little something, as if it were an afterthought. It has been repackaged, cleaned up, and has a couple of extra tracks. The album is a lot more complete now and has even more spark than the original vinyl version. David's voice is crystal clear and true. Space oddity will sound a little weird. In concert Bowie sat on the equivelant of a cherry picker and sang into a telephone. Without this bit of information the track sounds very strange. All the performers on the cd are on fire, especially Earl Slick during Width of a circle & Jean Jeanie <br />I have enjoyed Bowie's work since the early 70's, one of my favourite albums is Hunky Dory. He has changed some of the songs a bit for these performances but in a way that illustrates his talent. This is not one of those live albums where the artist \\"mails it in\\". Listen to the version of Changes and you will be captivated. Especially when he tells the Rock and Roll establishment \\"Look out you Rock'n'rollers!!!\\". If you are looking for classic Bowie during an exciting phase of his life then you can not do better than this. Spend the money on this CD rather than another Best of collection.
B00000DRXW|3.0|I hadn't listened to this album in many years, having worn out the original a ways back, but I felt compelled to comment after picking up the remixed CD. For me it's a split decision on this one. While it is whimsical and fun at times, and of course a technical tour de force, it leaves me somewhat unsatisfied. While de Lucia and Di Meola at their best are emotionally stirring, this trio seems to not have found that groove the night this was recorded. de Lucia and Di Meola work well together as a duo because they combine Al's blistering speed with Paco's more thoughtful, musical playing. Back and forth they go, Al revving it up and Paco reeling him back in. Truly magical, as in the studio versions of Mediterranean Sundance and Fantasia Suite. On this CD, as the liner notes say, this trio challenged each other to play with technical virtuosity, but the soul was lost. Good to have this album if you are an enthusiast; otherwise there's better acoustic guitar to be had.
B00006LFGD|3.0|This album is good, solid Streisand, mellow with no surprises.  Fans (which I am) will like it, but it won't convert anyone.  There are old, familiar tracks and a few I had not heard before, such as  those with Kim Carnes and Josh Groban.  My favorite track is \\"Cryin' Time\\" with Ray Charles -- just plain fun!
B00005J6T0|4.0|Some might find it funny for some reason but for the most part I listen to stuff like Alice Cooper and Ozzy Osbourne, I dont know why they would think it's such a big deal but some people just do. Maybey Madonna doesn't fit the image of a heavy metal fan but oh well I gues I have an open mind, if it's good music it's good music right ? Anyway Im a huge Madonna fan and I think this is by far her best album. <br /> <br />My favorate songs are definatly Open Your Heart, Live To Tell, Papa Dont Preach,  La Isla Bonita and White Heat, I dont mind the others's but I dont think they are as good as the ones I listed. <br /> <br /> This remastered version is unbelievable, the diference in quility is amazing and even if you already own the original do yourself a favour and pick this one up, you wont be disapointed.

B00005AQGH|5.0|to be a rap fan and not like this cd is oxymoronic, and if u didnt understand that last statement go home and listen to your j-kwon cd. it has been debated as the best cd to just \\"good\\" as in a 7-10 star rating span, to call this cd bad is a complete misunderstand of pac and rap in general. this album was 1 thing almost no rap albums today are, CREATIVE sure, why put out new things when the same garbage recycled still sells. enough of that lets go song by song. <br /> <br />1. intro 4.5/5 can we get any harder!? yet he does <br />2. hail mary 5/5 lyrically astonishing <br />3. toss it up 3.5/5 club song <br />4. to live and die in LA 4.5/5 great hook <br />5. blasphemy 5/5 can u write better than this? no u cant. <br />6. life of an outlaw 5/5 good chorus great beat <br />7. just like daddy 4.5/5 catchy chorus <br />8. krazy 3.5/5 worst song on the cd, not bad except in comparison <br />9. white manz world 4.5/5 the real conscinous MC shines <br />10 me and my girlfriend 5/5 beat is insane (produced by the man himself) and the lyrics have never been topped imo, jay-z was only laughed at for his re-make <br />11. hold ya head 4.5/5 great song period. <br />12. against all odds 4/5 nearly non-existant beat but nevertheless a great battle record.
0142000655|5.0|I first read EAST OF EDEN when I was in High School, and I thought it was one of the greatest books I had ever read.  I've just finished it (for the 3rd time) all these years later, and it still remains one of my favorite books. <br /> <br />Steinbeck's talk of the Hamiltons and the Trasks is lyrical and magical.  This is simply one of those books that everyone should read at least once in their lives.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Do you remember the state of The Blues in the early 80's? Of course you don't because it was nowhere. When SRV burst on the nationwide scene in 1983 Buddy Guy's career was over and guess what ... so was Eric Clapton's! How many albums since Stevie Ray has Clapton released that are blues albums? Pretty much all of them. Do guys like Johnny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepherd have careers if Texas Fllod isn't released? Probably not. Stevie Ray Vaughan is referred to as \\"the man who saved the blues.\\" Who says so? Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Guitar World Magazine. <br /> <br />Texas Flood is the album that made all of us sit up and reconsider the music that spawned the SRV's spiritual antecedent Jimi Hendrix Stones, The Beatles, Zeppelin, ZZ Top, The Black Crowes etc. and made all serious guitar players everywhwere say \\"wow, that hurts my fingers just listening.\\" <br /> <br />Stevie Ray did things on this album that has not been successfully and consistently imitated by anyone.
B000001IQH|4.0|this cd was one of the first punk cd's i bought. And im glad i got this albu. just on the first track alone i fell in love with it.. the bass solo on maxwell murder is amazing. its remarkable even to the most skilled bassists. matt freeman by far is the best bassist in punk. the rest of the cd is also very good. with melodic chorus' and catcy tunes but with nice punk riffs and hard raspy vocals on other parts. there are a few tracks i am not a fan of like #2 and the track daly city train.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is one of the best albums to come out in my lifetime.  I have heard Tool called \\"thinker's metal\\" and this is their grand masterpiece.  I actually had this album at one time but lost it and couldn't go on without getting a replacement.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|seeing the purests and elitests bashing this edition is pretty comical. time to grow up and see the directors cut for what it is. it's Walter Hill's vision of the legacy  this movie leaves for him. And overall its alot of fun. its ridiculous because  the purests who are bashing it are probably diehards who own the original dvd release along with the old vhs like i do. In that case, , put in the original version and presto, you have the pure unadulterated theatrical movie.  <br />  What this directors cut  offers is  a very decent series of featurettes that give you an in depth look at the inner workings of the film. Its also  a chance to see some of the films stars , people like Michael Beck, James Remar, David Harris and David Patrick Kelly among others as they look today and hear their account of the film and what it was like being a young person  at the time in New York. also, my personal fave  additions  are the movie stills included in the  featurette that show close-ups of the individual furies and turnbull's among others.  One of the most interesting dvd special features  ive seen yet as most are borefests, with the exception of the \\"Duel\\" SE dvd.  <br />  Let's face facts. The Warriors is a comic book brought to life. so why not  play around with the concept to give the  original fans something new to look at. It makes it look a bit campy, but hey, nothing wrong with that. The fact its based on the  Novel means nothing, because if you hve ever read the book, you probably wouldnt recognize the story as being the Warriors.  Walter hill took  the books basic premise and took it over the Top.  In fact, the books author Sol Yurick hated the Movie when it was originally released back in 79. <br />The one thing i would have liked to see included was full deleted scenes such as  the Boardwalk pre-meeting, the additional bathroom brawl footage or even the  police car speeding to the scene at Coney island at the films end . i have all this footage on vhs from variousTV late shows but it would be cool  to see as part of this package.  <br /> So all you bashers, take your own advice, hold on to the original as anyone into this movie should do. but enjoy the featurettes and lighten up .  Don't worry, when the remake MTV version of this film comes out in 06, this Directors cut is going to start to look a whole lot better
B000AADYRQ|3.0|I've listened to this album a few times now and have a few songs I love, like the opening track, but overall, think that it isn't as strong as their last one-- TRANSLATLANTISM.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I must admit, I originally bought this CD in order to hear Billy Boyd sing \\"The Steward of Gondor\\" as much as liked...but the music is so beautiful that I listen to the whole CD now.  Howard Shore is a musical genius.<br /><br />But, my favorite is still track five.  :-)
B0002S947K|5.0|The first time I put this cd in my stereo I listened to it for 3 hours straight and since then it has only gotten better. The music is amazing because it can match any mood. Also, I recently saw Ray LaMontagne in concert and it was even better than I imagined. His voice is so soothing, his songs are so touching, and he was so polite. I am thankful for this cd because it reminded me what real music is and what it can do.
0446677450|3.0|Reading this book has done some good. It made me want to learn more about investing and business. It doesnt contain any business or investment tips. Its easy to read, good for people who dont know anything about business and need to boost their self confidence.
B000AJJNOK|4.0|I shall start my review by saying do not read anyone else's review unless you can tell they are a hip hop fan. A review by anyone else is biased as well as stereotypical of rappers and the hip hop culture. Anyway, I listen to hip hop all the time, freestyles, actual albums, mixtapes, whatever, in any case, Mr. Curtis Jackson displays raw talent on all of the tracks on this album (what I refer to is his vocal delivery), HOWEVER, one thing he let his fans down on, true hardcore hip hop fans, is the subject matter and lyrics. I KNOW from 50's last album (Get Rich or Die Tryin') he has skill lyrically, but for some reason I guess he felt he didn't need to try as hard on this album being that he is THE biggest hip hop star now(alive that is). For all of you planning to buy this album, if you wanna buy it for the beats and not the lyricism, go ahead. The beat production is off the chain fo' real. BUT, all the lyrics are very much recycled and repetitive, basically, they all relate to cappin' or killin' or threatenin' somebody. It get's tired after a while. There are a few tracks that aren't this way (Outta Control Remix, Get in My Car, God Gave Me Style), but other than that it's all \\"I'ma kill you if you stand in my way\\" type of rappin'. 50 is a great rapper (listen to his freestyles) but somehow on this album he wasn't great, just plain good. 50 has the delivery, the skill, the charisma, and the ability, so it confused me to listen to the material on this album being that it lacked the heart and the effort of Get Rich or Die Tryin'. Good...but not great.
0060555661|4.0|I suppose it's dependent on the personal philosophy and nature of investors, but out of the highly recommend books on Amazon such as Common Stocks.., One up on Wall Street, Essays of Buffet, or A Random Walk..., the Intelligent Investor is probably my least favorite book.<br /><br />I found the writing to be a bit obtuse.  I think the reason many people found Graham's writing so clear is that in comparison to many business texts, it doesn't use fluffy business speak that's just too common.  However, the writing is on the same level as reading an obscure manual on repairing televisions.  It assumes a certain type of audience.<br /><br />Undeniably, Graham's original examples are harder to relate to, because the mentioned companies don't have as much ring to them as say Zweig's examples.  It's argued that the examples are timeless, so being outdated shouldn't matter.  However, it's harder to see the timelessness if the reader can't relate to the companies.  Zweig's commentary is very useful, because it takes an interpretive approach to modern examples helping to illustrate Graham's principles.<br /><br />Despite my criticisms, I still have high respect for this book.  Mr. Market, Margin of Safety, Intrinsic Value, Portfolio Allocation, and much more are lessons every reader should acquire from the book.  Afterwards, the knowledge from such a text should help the reader develop a stronger investment strategy/philosophy.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Errol Flynn in his signature role as Robin Hood, the dashing English nobleman who forsakes his wealth and title to battle the evil Prince John who plans to usurp the throne from it's rightful heir. While King Richard the Lionhearted is away fighting in the Holy Land (the Crusades) Robin of Locksly rebels against the excessive taxes leveled by Prince John to pay for an army of mercenaries to defeat King Richard upon his return. Robin retreats to Sherwood Forest to live the life of a thief with those loyal to the true king. He robs from the rich and gives to the poor as he slowly builds his own army to save King Richard and his kingdom.<br /><br />One of the truly great classics from the Golden Age of Hollywood featuring a cast to die for: Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains, Melville Cooper, Alan Hale and a list too numerous to mention.<br /><br />Action, adventure, romance and a large dose of comedy, 'The Adventures Of Robin Hood' will continue to delight even after multiple viewings. A masterpiece in cinematic entertainment, no DVD library can be considered complete without it!
B00092QUQC|5.0|Lipservice is a rocking return to form for Gotthard. Human Zoo lacked the spark of earlier efforts but this album is a parade of Roman Candles! From the kick a$$ intro of \\"All We Are\\" you know absolutely this is gonna be one helluva fun ride. The dirty groove of \\"Dream On\\" shows a renewed sense of rock & roll attitude. A good chorus and an excellent rythm guitar progression gets your whole body into the song. Now the first single is without a doubt the best original the bands ever released. \\"Lift U' Up\\" is as catchy as Glitters Rock & Roll and Billy Squier's Stroke easily, and a better song than both of those classics. Now don't get me wrong this album is not perfect but its the best pure rock album in fifteen years. The bands signature ballads are stadium ready for thousands of lighters. Another track that deserves a big nod is \\"I'm Alive\\" it just makes you wanna grow your hair and strut down the street with it blowing in the wind. \\"Nothing Left At All\\" is such a stellar song, it's a crying shame that it will never be a massive hit which it more than deserves to be. The soulful vocal and the sweet guitar fills are something special for sure. The song is a number one hit if Rod Stewart would have released it on his covers cd a few years back. Gotthard are a band that blow their peers away. Bands like Bon Jovi, Poison & Warrant to a lesser degree all got famous and bands this good are left in the cold. It just doesn't make sense.....
014028009X|4.0|I loved this book because of Bridget Jones' imperfections. I laughed when I saw that she does things I do, too, in my own real life diary, like list each day's calories, for instance. I had to laugh at her getting up in the middle of the night to weigh herself, cause I've done that, too, more than once. This was a funny, witty, good-natured trip into the life and secret soul of a likable professional woman of the late 1990's.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|The idea of a copy protected CD is the worst thing that a band can do. It's telling their fans that they don't like music, that they just like the money and benefit from it. <br /> <br />Personally, I'm not going to buy any more foo fighters cd's or DVD's.
B00005JNJV|5.0|This is the best batman movie. The other ones were pretty corny besides the first two.  I saw this the day it came out and I was amazed on how good it was.
0452282152|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I liked its simplicity and its careful details. The storyline is somewhat thin but somehow it manages to propel the reader along. I enjoyed seeking out and looking at the paintings that are referenced in the story, the author certainly managed to shed new light on them. <br />  I would recommend this book to anyone who seeks a quick, absorbing read.
B000AL730O|2.0|Maybe it's just me.  Reading all the positive reviews makes me wonder why I wasn't really enthusiastic about this album.  Various publications have reviewed it as well and in reading between the lines, the impression is that most felt it to be a pretty average effort.  It seems that as Paul gets older he feels that it would be inappropriate to continue to do what he does best.  A few years ago, the terrific \\"Flaming Pie\\" album came out and it impressed me as a natural progression of Paul's incredible talent.  Three years ago with the release of \\"Driving Rain\\", I thought this must be an aborition, a rare mistake in a long history of wonderful music with only 3 or 4 songs that were anywhere near memorable.  Quite frankly, there are only one or two songs on this album that I even listen to.  Maybe \\"Fine Line\\" and \\"English Garden\\". <br /> <br />Pleae, Paul, the Beatles were the best group in musical history and Wings were not bad.  Bring back the sound that made us all recapture that wonderful 60s feeling.  Meantime, I'll listen to \\"Fine Line\\" a couple of more times hoping that maybe it will grow on me.
B0000024VP|5.0|This is a fine album, filled with highly crafted pop music. This album, along with Epics' Donovan's Greatest Hits are great 'starter discs' for this artist.   [...]
B000957O82|5.0|It's a romantic comedy with class. You may even increase your chances with the lady you want if you watch closely.
B000003C4K|5.0|There are very few albums out there that can match the intensity of this album. Exodus are legends in the THRASH genre and this is where it all started. If you are new to EXODUS or just discovered them due to \\"Tempo of The Damned (2004)\\" or \\"Shovel Headed Kill Machine (2005)\\" then this is the next album you need to pick up. If you are just looking on where to introduce yourself to EXODUS, then you need to start here! Bonded By Blood was recorded in 1984 and took nearly a year to release due to red tape. I believe if this had been released in 1984 as intended, EXODUS would have gained much more respect from the metal community. Now to the music.  <br /> <br />Bonded By Blood starts off with the title track. The riffs are crazy and heavy and very memorable. Paul Baloff (original vocalist) sounds more pissed off and violent than anything that came before this album with the exception of Slayer's \\"Show No Mercy.\\" The riffs are full and chunky which will want to make you snap your neck banging! While I won't spoil the album for you by describing every track, I will say that the following are the stand out tracks: \\"And Then There Were None\\" which is a mid-paced song with vocals that are all over the place. This song is probably the most memorable and catchiest on the album. Then there is \\"Lesson in Violence\\" which is a song that is full of piss and vinegar and is still an Exodus \\"classic\\" to this day. This was also the original album title prior to using \\"Bonded By Blood.\\" Any finally you have \\"Strike of the Beast\\" which EXODUS usually closes their set with to this day. A great song with heavy kick drums and fast riffs.  <br /> <br />This album is so underrated by the overall metal community that it is criminal. This album clearly holds its own up against the debuts of SLAYER, METALLICA, ANTHRAX & MEGADETH but for whatever reason failed to garner the same success as these bands. I have over 2000 CDs and this one still makes it into my player at least one a week. A great album by a great band! Definitely one that I highly recommend!!

B000002IGP|3.0|Ratt came crashing onto the scene in 1984 with their first full-length album Out of the Cellar. Round and Round was the big MTV hit from Out of the Cellar. Other highlights include Wanted Man. Check out Tawny Kitean on the album cover. Out of the Cellar is a pretty good pop/metal album, but all of the hits from Out of the Cellar can be found on Ratt and Roll 8191 making Out of the Cellar only of interest to hardcore Ratt fans.
0312323859|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was part two of the first one Something Borrowed. I literally could not put the book down for the first two days and forced myself to so that I could go to work. I finished it and can't wait for another book from this author to come out.
B000003TAR|2.0|In Utero is Nirvana's follow up to their highly success debut Nevermind. Quality wise In Utero is about the same as Nevermind, a fair album from a fair band. Highlights include: Heart Shaped Box, and Rape Me. If you enjoyed Nevermind I'm sure you'll enjoy In Utero.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This band is really great. they have such a unique sound. The first time I heard them on a track from White Blood Cells, I thought, \\"This is weird.\\" But they never caught my attention until my friend gave me a mix of songs with two from this CD. I immediately bought it with hope in my mind that I hadn't already heard the only good songs. The songs are almost all 5 stars. The CD gets 5 stars though, because it was really well done. The one thing I still have trouble believing is that it's a 2 person band. Both of the Whites have very good musical talent. I believe that they recieved an award for Fell in Love with a Girl from the album White Blood Cells. If the award was for that CD, they should be getting another award for this CD.
B00004YZT5|1.0|The blacksheep of the catalog, on Native Tongue Poison tries to get along without C.C. Deville. The absence of C.C. is not what makes this album bad, with Native Tongue Poison tried a new direction. This is not the Poison that I love. Gone are the party anthem's like Nothin' But a Good Time, what's left is Poison taking a shot at being serious. Native Tongue flat out sucks! The did have a minor hit with the song Stand, which can be found on Poison's Greatest Hits. Go buy Look What the Cat Dragged In, Open Up and Say Ahh, and Flesh and Blood instead of this piece of garbage.
B000001EIA|5.0|This DVD has a CD to it that not every KISS fan, but every rock fan should listen to at least once. I really never expected the acoustic KISS to be good but it really is. It is much more calm, and much more mature sounding. They didn't play any of the hard core songs like Strutter, but the songs they did play went great with the acoustic sound. Another thing I was surprised about was that Ace showed up! I was worried that he would have skipped out on this because of past relations with the band. The concert went great. The fans were cheering by the time it got to Rock N Roll All Nite, which also was a good acoustic version. So if you are interested, or already listening to KISS, you should definitely get this DVD or CD.
B000001FS3|3.0|U2's The Joshua Tree was a huge smash in 1987 when it was released. I'll gladly admit that I am not a huge fan of U2, but the Joshua Tree is a pretty decent cd. The best songs, in my opinion are Where the Streets Have No Name, With or Without You, and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For. The cd as a whole is pleasant and listenable, but the above metioned three songs are the only one that really leave an impression with me after the cd is done.
B000AYEIZY|2.0|There is one word that sums up my viewpoint of the audio <br />of this performance and that is... disappointing. I haven't <br />seen the DVD yet but after listening to the CD I don't  <br />really have a desire to watch them put in a lackuster <br />performance. I sensed there wasn't a unified band up <br />there, just three guys each doing his own thing. At one <br />point in \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" Clapton starts to go <br />into a burning lead but Bruce starts singing again and <br />Eric has to jump back into the rhythm. Bruce sounds <br />half dead up there and there is none of Ginger Baker's <br />fire. If they're going to have a reunion concert as Cream then <br />they should play like Cream... with fire, with all stops <br />pulled out that literally moves you. Clapton doing Clapton <br />doesn't do justice to the Wheels of Fire live Fillmore masterpiece \\"Crossroads\\". That performance was sheer genius <br />and to this day remains one of my favorite live guitar <br />pieces. I've never heard Clapton even come close to doing <br />Crossroads like that since. I've heard some pretty <br />laid back,uninteresting versions of it from him. This is <br />one of them. Also I was disappointed by the choice of <br />songs to include... where's three of their best --- from <br />Disraeli Gears?... Swlabr, Tales of Brave Ulysses and <br />Strange Brew... some of Eric's greatest guitar playing. <br />Their music, especially live, inspired me in the 60's <br />and got me to love fiery psychedelic blues. I guess <br />you can't ever go home again but I wish they'd come <br />a lot closer on this disappointing recording.
B000003TA4|2.0|Nirvana's Nevermind really kicked things off for the early 90's Seatle Grunge movement. A new sound for a new decade, Nirvana and other grunge groups put an end to the popularity of the 80s pop/metal movement. While, Nirvana is an alright band, but I don't consider Kurt Cobain the musical genious that many people claim he his. Kurt wrote some really good songs, but Nevermind isn't really a masterpiece by any means. Smells Like Teen Spirit, and Come as You Are are very good songs, and Nevermind is an enjoyable listen every once in awhile, many of the songs don't leave a lasting impression. If you're a teenager you'll probably want Nevermind, but since they have a greatest hits album I'd recommend that as a starting point to new fans.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|This memo is right off the official Live 8 DVD website and explains what will be on the US/Canadian version.  The memo refers to it as the Canadian DVD but Canada and US are both region 1 for DVD so it's the same DVD set.

B000001EKX|3.0|Hotter Than Hell was released the same year that Kiss released their debut album. Hotter Than Hell is slightly weaker than Kiss, but considering that Kiss's second album followed their debut by months, Hotter Than Hell is a pretty good effort. Highlights include Watchin' You, and Hotter Than Hell. At this point Kiss were showmen, and had yet to find a way to capture that talent onto record.
B0000025H6|4.0|No doubt that this album is nothing short of brilliant, but be warned it's not an easy one to sit through, as it takes the listener on an emotional roller coster ride. <br /> <br />OK, so a lot of other people have explained that this is a concept album, and it is true, the album is loosely held together by the notion of the one man's journey behind his own emotional wall.  However, do not be put off by this, as their are many songs here that can, and do, stand on their own - Such as \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\":Another Brick in the Wall part 2\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\" \\"Young Lust\\" and \\"Hey You\\".   <br /> <br />There are a lot of tracks on the album that are there to seque together the real meaty songs and as such they can be considered \\"filler\\" but when listening to the overall album you can see where they fit. <br /> <br />The album is a dark ride and could be considered depressing if the melodies and vocal harmonies weren't so beautiful.  \\"Goodbye Ble Sky\\" has a depressing Lyric but is held up by the Beach Boy like harmonies and Dave Gilmours airy accoustic guitar work.  \\"Comfortably Numb\\" has the beautiful contrast of the dark verses (sung by Waters) rising up to the ethereal/dreamy chorus sung by Gilmour, before his guitar takes you to another place in the outro. <br /> <br />You've gotta be in the mood to listen to some of this album's more theatrical points (like The Trial, which is a mind bender and something you would be more likely to find in an Oliver Twist like musical). <br /> <br />Still, there is much great music on this CD and it's well worth a listen, if you haven't already.
B000000OQF|4.0|What's with all the people saying that Guns n Roses ripped off of Creed and many other bands that are out today. Umm...hello people...*or should I says idiots* These guys came before them! Without GNR and many other of the bands you diss  your music of crap wouldn't even be around. Seriously people, do you actually bother to know when bands came out. Or do you like to loook like the biggest idiots on the internet? <br />Now then. I was never really into Metal but GNR chanegd that. Just because time changes means that   what people liek does. Oh and to that guy that says MTV plays good music. Yeah...what good music?  About every single song is the same thing or  it's something new , but it really sucks. Music today is too linear. That is why people still like bands from back then. Even today. Get the messege people? Or do I need to explain further? LEARN TO NOT FOLLOW THE MEDIA! Everyone single time the media shows off a band suddenly everyone likes them. Even if they hated them. And every time the media showed  off a band. The music was still crap. But people still choose to folow suit. I know people have thier own opinions, but really. Why listen to something that has the same sound on every song? Get this people. It is as classic and good as anything can get....not really, but it's still better then pretty much anything out today. It showcases many  old favs that are STILL played on the radio. And some other great songs that aren't. It's called staying power kiddies. Learn to live with  your hatred and  embrace the \\"hairy\\" metal. Did you notice that every single band today is only around for a few years after the media showcases them? Give it some time and pretty soon all the \\"cool\\" bands now will be gone. That never happened back then, which is why these bands are still favored today. And they always will be. Once again...learn to embrace the metal...your favorite bands won't be around for long
B00001NFCY|4.0|I would recommend ignoring the 1-star ratings. I think that this CD is certainly worth listening to. As a musician myself, I think there is a lot to be said for Creed's musical talent; in many ways its too bad they are no longer together. <br /> <br />Some critics accuse them of being derivative and formulaic. I can't say the extent to which they have borrowed from Perl Jam, as I have not listened to much Perl Jam, but I would disagree to an extent with the accusations of being formulaic. <br /> <br />I understand some people were disappointed that the CD was not more overtly Christian. I think that it is definitly there though, much in the same way that it is \\"there\\" in many other bands such as U2.
0743243153|5.0|When this book entered the general marketplace 25 years ago, it served as an excellent reality check against the \\"Just be positive and it will all work out fine\\" and \\"Fake it until you make it\\" flawed positive thinking model which had swept through Western society.  Scott Peck's message that \\"life is difficult\\" reached people who were ready to face the truth and tackle life head on.  Through many interactions with patients, he shows us that we can overcome our past failures and limiting perceptions, to increase our self esteem and the quality of our lives.  I recommend this classic book together with another superb book, Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self.  Optimal Thinking is the road along which we all make the most of the everpresent moment, any situation, business and life.  Read both books!
B000AYEIZY|4.0|I'm sure the title of this review will lose many others who treasure Wheels of Fire, the Live Cream volumes, as well as the Goodbye album and they are pretty high on my list too but I have to say this is my favorite live cream offering yet. There is more focus, cohesion, and lyricism to the performances. Everyone has aged well in their craft, and songs like Spoonful or Sweet Wine in shorter versions make for a more varied and entertaining record. If it weren't for the record company leaving off Sitting On Top of the World with ample room on the second disc, I would give it five stars. That having been said, I do agree with a couple of other reviewers though, in that you need to see the DVD first to get the full appreciation of this record.
1573223026|5.0|This may be my favorite Nick Hornby novel yet.  It makes me wonder if Hornby has experienced depression himself, because the character's narratives of their emotional bottoming-out feel so authentic.  But please don't steer clear of this book because the characters are depressed- this is not a depressing book!  It is unique and unpredictable, and very funny at times.  There is also a sense of warmth to the book as the characters make connections to each other and start taking steps to widen the scope of their lives. In that way, the book reminds me of _About a Boy_, though I believe it is a better book for exploring the lives of a more diverse group of characters.  Definitely a 5-star read.
B00005JO0J|5.0|This film is classic Joss Whedon and will leave you breathless at the end as if you were in on the action. Whedon doesn't disappoint fans with high expectations, but also gives enough background so that newcomers aren't totally lost. I think, however, there's much more depth for viewers of the series or who have seen the reruns on SciFi channel. There just isn't enough time to cover the relationships in a two hour movie. But the series is just that good--if you haven't seen it before the movie, I'll guarantee you will afterwards.    One departure Whedon takes from other sci-fi shows is the ship and scenes are much more realistic and believable. Serenity is a cargo ship and looks like one. It's functional and not all shiny and clean like on Star Trek. The colonized towns look more like the old west, except for the hovercraft and six shooters that fire lasers. There's definitely a western feel to things with a little Asian thrown in. Frequently, the crew is given to swear in a Mandarin-sounding language which is a sweet way to keep the ratings and yet be believable. Some of the cities and even the Serenity sport Asian decor and writing.     I find it interesting the Whedon is allegedly agnostic because he slips in a lot of religious themes. There's first and foremost Shepard Book, the preacher with the mysterious past, played wonderfully by Ron Glass in the series and who has way too short a role in the film. (Oldsters will remember that Glass played a detective in the comedy Barney Miller.) Inara, a companion, is a Buddhist. And Mr. Universe, a pirate broadcaster, has a Jewish wedding with his robot companion. (I, Robot anyone?) Even The Operative (played chillingly by Chiwetel Ejiofor) has his own twisted creed.    Another theme of the movie (without giving anything away) is the harm done when the government mettles. In the series, two genius siblings become passengers. Simon, a doctor, smuggles his sister, River, who has been used as a guinea pig by the universal government known as the Alliance. She is a psychic and they have tried to tap into her brain. This has left her unstable and possibly dangerous even to her friends. Simon gave up his budding career to save her and now the Alliance wants her back so they put The Operative on Serenity's trail.     Serenity is a roller coaster in a movie theater--it catapults you along. You'll laugh (a lot!), you'll cry and yes, you'll cheer. This is also a thinking person's sci-fi movie and it will give you a lot to ponder later. One hopes Whedon can work the same magic he was able to with Buffy and resurrect this movie back into a series. SciFi channel, are you listening?
B00005R1N3|5.0|This is a very classy horror of the psychological kind, predating Halloween by 4 years and similar in many ways. The film is unrelenting, harrowing, and will leave you genuinely frightened with the horror of the unseen. The ending is truly an original concept in terms of the horror genre. It would be very difficult to better a film of this kind within these parameters.

B000AV2G3I|5.0|Well, today is John Lennon's birthday: a perfect day to write a review of Working Class Hero. First, I have to say, I just won this cd this very morning on our working class hero's birthday, from a Beatles' radio program (Breakfast with the Beatles on KSYM in San Antonio)!<br /><br />That being said, with not a little gloating, I have all of John's albums, including several compilations. The tracks on WCH do a great job of covering his solo career. Every song is a Lennon gem. Of course, there are many great songs not here, but that can't be avoided. The only perfect compilation would be a boxed set with every single album! Otherwise, this collection is a great intro for the newbie as well as being a nice addition to any old fan's Lennon library.<br /><br />Yes, the songs are not in chronological order, but as it is, it's a great mix cd. John's musical life is well documented here with this super-sized collection. It's a must-have and a great gift for parents, grandparents, children, friends, and everybody else!<br /><br />Happy Birthday John<br /><br />...and thank you for the music
B00005JNTX|3.0|told in a most complex and violent way...but with each scenario there runs a common thread which is not found in the headlines of the news of today...Males Protecting and Defending Females.  I personally would not allow children to view this or those that could not get through a \\"Kill Bill.\\"  The way the story line weaves through \\"Sin City\\", makes it worth watching for adults....and look for that theme I said above...it is there... and in the end, you will smile knowing that some men do care!
0786890754|5.0|This book really makes you realize how to cherish every moment you have with someone. Especially your husband. After reading this book, I wanted to give my husband a big hug. This book really made me think about how important it is to never take our lives for granted.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Queen may not be the best rock and roll band ever; but they clearly stand at the top of the mountain.  \\"Queen - The Platinum Collection: Greatest Hits I, II & III\\" is simply outstanding.  What a collection, for old guyes like myself it brings back memories of truly GREAT rock and roll!
B00008BXJG|5.0|Highway to Hell (1979). AC/DC's fourth album.<br /><br />AC/DC's final effort with singer Bon Scott, and their 4th album release outside of Australia, Highway to Hell is AC/DC's finest album, period. Part of what makes it so good is new producer John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, who improved Bon Scott's vocal sound, making it raw and raspy. He really took a leap above Vanda and Young's already great production with this album- he really made the \\"gang\\" choruses sung by Malcolm and Cliff more prominent.<br /><br />The songs are killer, too, including the radio friendly, catchy-riffed (aren't they all) Highway to Hell, and others such as Shot Down In Flames and Girls Got Rhythm. If You Want Blood (You've Got It) is also a great tune with a nice chorus. Not really a weak track on here. All killer, no filler. AC/DC sounds their wildest on this album and Bon sounds like a madman! His lyrics on here still haven't lost any of their bite.<br /><br />Soon after this album, in early 1980, Bon died. For me, it is probably the saddest of all rock star deaths. Even though AC/DC was great with Brian Johnson, they were even better with Bon. Bon has said that the next one would have been their best.<br /><br />As for this new digipak reissue and remaster, it's top notch. I have the LP version and this sounds just as great, if not better. The sound is crisp, with boomy bass and smashing drum sounds. It also comes with a 16 page booklet with liner notes and rare photos of the band. It's too bad the booklet dosn't come with lyrics for all the songs, but you can easily find them on the internet. for the digipak, it wears easily, but looks nice and is very attractive. This album is a excellent first choice for those new to AC/DC, and a must own veteran fans of the band (who most likely already have it in some form or another).<br /><br />In short, this ends up as one of the hardest rocking albums ever. Screaming, ripping, tearing, and burning, AC/DC blistered the competition of the late 70s rock scene and made lifelong fans of listeners everywhere. An all time classic.0s rock scene and made lifelong fans of listeners everywhere. An all time classic.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This DVD is absolutely top quality. The band is close to perfect in their execution, the set list is great, sound and picture fantastic. Totally recommend this DVD!
B000683VI4|5.0|This DVD came in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  Thank you so much!....  ** This movie is WONDERFUl, but should come with a warning label... if you are emotional, be careful with this one!  A great love story that you'll never forget.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|Although, this wasn't what I had anticipated from them, I knew the album was going to be different from their first two after hearing some clips of the new songs they were performing live over the summer. If you're a hardcore fan of the sound from their first two releases, you might not be prepared for the straight-ahead approach they take on \\"Howl\\". However, these guys have essentially stripped down their sound to show that they can write great songs with or without droning and feedback. If they continue on this track, their 4th album will be astonishing. These guys are untouchable right now in this genre. What a pleasant surprise!!!
B00000JCOV|5.0|what i love about slipknot, and especialy on this album, is that you can really feel what they are trying to express in their songs even if you cant personnely relate to it. this is probably my second favorite cd they put out (i hated vol.3). <br />its very near pefection, but like almost every other cd it does have some flaws. <br /> <br />(sic)10/10= this song captures the true essence of being pissed off, one of my favs <br /> <br />eyeless 6/10= not that best, but it does have an awesome chorus, kinda drags in the middle <br /> <br />wait and bleed 10/10= maybe my favorite, really great lyrics, they do a great job of going from extremely melodic to extremely brutal <br /> <br />surfacing 10/10= best chorus in the world, and the guitar in the beginning is really cool <br /> <br />spit it out 9/10= super fast song about (yet again) being pissed off <br /> <br />tattered and torn 7/10= not my favorite, but good <br /> <br />me inside 5/10= an ok song <br /> <br />liberate 8/10= really great, kinda like left behind <br /> <br />prosthetics 9/10= really awesome song with creepy lyrics <br /> <br />no life 4/10= not great <br /> <br />diluted 7/10= pretty good, again great lyrics <br /> <br />only one 5/10= i dont really like it besides the intro <br /> <br />scissors 10/10= amazing song, this, wait and bleed, and surfacing, are the best on this album <br />
B000063COX|5.0|Iron Maiden (1980) Iron Maiden's debut.<br /><br />I'd like to say that THIS was the Iron Maiden CD that I started with. Not Number of the Beast, folks. It took a little while to get used to the Maiden sound, but it was an absolute grower and now I can't get enough of it.<br /><br />After a much-requested (by the fans) Soundhouse Tapes release, Maiden knew they had their work cut out for them to make their debut LP. So they did, recording it in 1979 and making it ready for release by early 1980. It was an awsome fusion of melodic rock, punk, and heavy metal, and it certainly showed what was to come for Maiden- if their debut was this good, what could come next? This lineup was one of Maiden's earliest album-wise, it had the rough and ready Paul Di'Anno vocals and original guitarist Dennis Stratton and drummer Clive Burr. This would be Stratton's last LP with Maiden.<br /><br />Tracks:<br />Prowler- An awsome opener! Wouldn't think of anything else opening off this terrific CD. It's fast, tough, and has good guitar licks courtesy of Dave Murray and Maiden's old guitarist Dennis Stratton. Features some ripping solos in the middle. Funny but questionable lyrics, has a good song title though. Maiden hooks you with this song, and sets the tempo for the rest of the record. Greatness. 5/5<br /><br />Sanctuary- Originally released shortly after this album as a single, Sanctuary is sometimes cut down by fans, but I, for one, love it. It just chugs along with some good backbone by drummer Clive Burr and bassist (our man!) Steve Harris. I like the lyrics alot. Don't know why this song is so cut down by some people. The only bonus track on this reissue CD. 5/5<br /><br />Remember Tommorow- Whoa. This is a knockout- you just have to hear it! Sometimes melodic, sometimes hard, but it rocks like no other. Memorable track. 5/5<br /><br />Running Free- Concert fave (done with much audience participation when Dickinson joined). A little overrated, but that's just my opinion. First song played totally live on Top of the Pops (early 1980) since the Who played there in 1972. 3/5<br /><br />Phantom of the Opera- Best song off the album, and with good reason. Unbelieveable composition by Harris, it goes through alot of tempo changes and also features some firing and melodic guitar solos by Murray, plus the mean intro riff. Essential listening- you just have to hear the live version on Live After Death- awsome! 5/5<br /><br />Transylvania- Memorable instrumental track- it's great and I think the album wouldn't feel complete without a burning instrumental. This track was originally going to have vocals, but it was never carried through. Follows up Phantom of the Opera very well. 5/5<br /><br />Strange World- MOST UNDERRATED TRACK OF THE ALBUM! Simply love this song- just because it's not heavy dosn't mean it isn't great- full of beautiful solos by Murray, great singing by Paul Di'Anno and solid bass by Harris. One of my favorites off the album. 5/5<br /><br />Charlotte the Harlot- The sole Dave Murray composition off the album- he composed the lyrics and the music. Starts off heavy and fast with funny lyrics, then has a tempo change, and what- back to the original opening riff! Can't help but like this song. 5/5<br /><br />Iron Maiden- Maiden's signature track, and they do it at almost every concert- with good reason. The catchy riff was written by very early guitarist Dave Sullivan (around 1976- the first lineup). Great song. 5/5<br /><br />As for the new 2002 remaster/reissue, well, I haven't heard the old one but as far as sound quality (it was remastered by Simon Heyworth at Chop 'em Out in 1998, and he, with Robert Fripp, also remastered the entire King Crimson catalogue in SACD and they sound unbelieveable. He does an excellent job) and packaging, it is great. It comes with some slightly informative notes (major dates in for the band in 1980) and full lyrics, plus some great photos. Also contains original album and singles artwork and comes witha slipcase. No complaints. It is well done and the Enhanced CD portion comes with two live videos (from late 1980 - Live at the Rainbow, with Adrian Smith, the replacement guitarist for Dennis Stratton) plus complete tour dates and some more rare photos and info.<br /><br />I would say this Maiden CD is simply essential and will be in my head (and CD player) for a long time. It is certainly one of metal's all-time best debuts.(from late 1980 - Live at the Rainbow, with Adrian Smith, the replacement guitarist for Dennis Stratton) plus complete tour dates and some more rare photos and info.     I would say this Maiden CD is simply essential and will be in my head (and CD player) for a long time. It is certainly one of metal's all-time best debuts.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|What a great direction of Jane Austen's Persuasion!  The actor's and actresses chosen brilliantly. If you truly love this era of life, and love Jane Austen, you won't have regretted buying this version.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched it, and I've only owned it for 3 weeks.
0385513755|4.0|It is a good thriller - I am awaiting the film as well.
0307165485|5.0|I had this book when I was little - almost 25-30 years ago. It's the most charming children's book I have ever come across. An array of bedtime stories, people at work, alphabets, numbers and things like how colours are formed make it delightful. I still have my copy of it. My ma used to read it to me - still fills me and also overwhelms me. Its a treasure after all these years to her and to me. I gave it to two of my nieces - they love it and so do their folks. Its not an average storybook it precious seals moments between parent and child.
B000002MIF|5.0|What difference does it make? Without Johnny Marr, a lot. One can argue the same for bassist Andy Rourke. The rhythm section so very tight--singer Morissey's usual self-involved insipidness becomes confessional, frustrated and inspired. You might think he's revealing the secrets of the universe through a rock, post-wave lense. He's no more convincing than when he sings \\"I crack the whip and you skip,\\" against a menacing Marr guitar line. Or try the layered guitar tremolo lead to this declaration, \\"I am the son and the heir, of nothing in particular.\\" Hell, even in context, lines like, \\"there's more to life than books, but not much more,\\" become worthy aphorisms. In the end the music is so good you end up rooting for Morissey. Please let him get what he wants. Ok, but only within the pocket of Marr & Rourke.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|DCFC is a fine indie band and it's refreshing to just see well built songs sang with sincerity back in vogue... other acts such as Aqualung (Strang and Beautiful) Bill Ricchini (Tonight I Burn Brightly), and Arcade Fire (Funeral) shedding the 90s irony and making a statement of melodic truth (plus great songs) is a treat.
B00064AM6C|5.0|Perfection.  Absolute perfection.  But before you go away, let me say ... when I wrote this review, there were 48 existing reviews, and I noticed something interesting.  Looking through the archive, I found two of the most shocking sentences on any Amazon item review page, especially one with 50 reviews: <br /> <br />1. \\"There are no two-star reviews.\\" <br />2. \\"There are no one-star reviews.\\" <br /> <br />This speaks volumes.  In the rock world, the White Stripes are often one of the most controversial bands--not because they incite social controversy (although it's arguable), but because they're what one of the three-star reviewers here referred to as a band that makes good music by using weak musicians.  Now, don't get me wrong, I personally think Jack White is a brilliant musician, but I understand the point, especially since the reviewer is a teacher of guitar.  The White Stripes are raw, exciting--carnal, almost.  I challenge ANY fan of music in ANY genre to give this DVD a good, fair watch or listen, and not be drawn in.  It's exciting, fast, and draws you as close to the souls of these two musicians as you can get without going to an actual live concert.  And please, eventually do that, too.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|This movie was really good.  The oompa songs were a little disapponiting, but overall it was one of my favorite movies.  Johnny Depp also pulls off a very unique role that, despite what people say, is not at all similar to Micheal Jackson.  I also thought that the children had some great acting, and that the makeup was very good.  Probably the best parts of the movie are the very vivid colors and great art direction.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Before I begin the review, I'd like to say one thing: Whoever keeps posting the \\"GREENDAYSUCKS\\" reviews has no taste in music. All they're doing is copying the same thing and posting it on the reviews of Green Day's CD's, even though they've probably never heard any of their music before.  And, for what it's worth...    \\"1. They are the worst case of sellouts\\"  Sellouts? SELLOUTS! One of the best things about Green Day is, despite how popular they've become (It's not their fault that people like their music) they've kept there integrity. They stay true to their punk roots while experimenting with new types of music. And, as I remember, people were calling them sellouts 12 years ago when they came out with Dookie- please, make up your mind, people! Green Day has more fans than haters, and the haters, don't even appreciate their music. Is it such a crime to experiment with new types of music? The guys in Green Day have been playing for over 20 years now, they have to expand and branch out to different genres in order to keep people interested and add some variety to their sound. Besides, does the fact that they're on MTV once in a while make their music any better/worse?     \\"2. They have barely any musical talent\\"  I'm sorry, but I completely disagree with this statement- Green Day is one of the most talented bands ever; just as good as the Ramones, The Clash, and all of those legendary bands. Billie Joe Armstrong has an amazing voice (especially compared to some of those other bands' lead singers out there today, i.e.: Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, etc.) He's also a songwriting genius and amazing at guitar. Mike Dirnt is one of the most talented bassists in the world- if you listen closey to some of their songs, you can hear how intricate and catchy the basslines are. And I can't forget Tre Cool- the most amazing drummer I've ever heard, even better than Travis Barker from Blink-182.     \\"3. Their songs all sound alike\\"  Uh, I beg to differ! Sure, a lot of the songson Insomniac or 1039/Smoothed Out Slappy hours seem a little similar...but none of them sound exactly alike! One of the great things about Green Day is they play a wide variety of music, from the catchy, classic-punk \\"Welcome to Paradise\\", to the compelling songs on American Idiot, to the hardrock, catchy \\"Hitchin' A Ride\\" and \\"Nice Guys Finish Last\\", to soft acoustic songs (\\"Good Riddance\\", \\"Warning\\"), unique, eclectic songs like \\"Brain Stew\\" and \\"Geek Stink Breath\\", and a few experimental songs like \\"King For A Day\\", the snarling \\"Take Back\\", and more...the list goes on and on.    \\"4. They tried to become new-generation rock \\"  Green Day aren't \\"trying\\" to be anything- they've never really followed the trend. The only reason that some of their new songs have sounded a little similar to those of new bands is because they inspire people! I've read many, many magazine articles about new bands, and groups like Simple Plan, Fall Out Boy, and Blink-182 have said that Green Day's music has influenced them. While rap/hip hop was extremely popular and emo was the new thing, Green Day completely went against the grain and produced a rock opera!     \\"5. Anyone associated with them is a poser   6. They are posers and have made more kids into posers   7. After claiming hardrock they make terrible poser songs\\"  If I had a dollar for every time somebody has called a great rock group like Green Day, or even a legendary band like The Sex Pistols \\"posers\\", I'd have more money than Britney Spears, Mary-Kate and Ashley, Oprah, and Bill Gates combined. First of all, they don't claim \\"hard-rock\\"; they don't really fit into any sort of genre because they play a wide variety of music! They're not overconfident at all; they just like what they do. Who cares if a band is full of \\"posers\\" or not? If you like their music, you like it. You don't have to put a label on it.    \\"8. Not one song they made has ever been good\\"  I'm not even going to bother with that one...    \\"9. Thanks to them, all i can hear on radios is Holiday, the worst song of all time   10. I have to listen to people hum their retarded poser punk music in class\\"  This just goes to show that whoever \\"GREENDAYSUCKS\\" is doesn't know any of their music besides the stuff they hear on the radio! (Although Holiday is a good song). Hey, it's not their fault that they're so good that a lot of people like them.    \\"Now coems the best part....the poser wanna be rocker clicks no and tries to stay tough.......try listening to Zeppelin, if you arent too busy with the new-wave crappy excuse for music\\"  Ughh...this is the part that bugs me the most. After completely trashing Green Day like that, this person has the audacity to say that Led Zeppelin is \\"real\\" music and Green Day isn't? Just because Led Zeppelin have been around for a while doesn't mean they're that great. Personally, I think they're nothing more than screeching hippies in tight pants that completely forget about the melody of the song and go overboard on the guitar solo. And please, try to spell \\"comes\\" right next time you right a review.    Well, now that I'm done complaining, here's the actual review.    I had heard from many people that this was Green Day's worst album, so I held off on it for a while. I had all of their other albums, including 1039 and Kerplunk, so one day I decided I was in need of I decided I was in need of another Green Day CD and I bought this one. I expected that it would be   so-so, but I put it in my CD player when I got home and I absolutely loved it! It's a brilliant album. Sure, some of the tracks are a little poppy, but it's just as punk as their other albums, and really presents a turning point for the band.    1. Warning: An interesting way for Green Day to start an album. I wouldn't say it's a slow song, but it's pretty much all acoustic. I love the lyrics, though- it satires paranoid people and sayings such as \\"Don't take candy from strangers\\" or \\"keep out of reach of children.\\"   8.5/10     2. Blood, Sex, and Booze: This is one of my favorite songs on Warning. It's all electric guitar, and I love the way Billie Joe's voice sounds on it. There are a few key changes in it, which adds to the greatness of the song. Billie even uses some nice voice tricks in the end. Green Day really takes some risks with this song and its content. 10+/10    3. Church on Sunday: Personally, I'm not a big fan of this song...it's a bit poppy for my taste. Other people might like it though. In fact, it's even started to grow on me. It's basically about Billie Joe making   compromises for his wife, Adrienne (\\"if I promise to go to church on Sunday/Will you go with me on Friday night\\"...) 8/10    4. Fashion Victim: I LOVE THIS SONG! Fashion Victim showcases how great Green Day is at writing songs! It almost pokes fun at people who get caught up in fashion trends. (\\"Living well and dressed to kill/but she looks like hell to me\\"...). I love the way Billie says \\"So when you're dancing through your wardrobe/do the anorex-a-go-go\\". The backup vocals   on Mike's part are also very good. 10/10    5. Castaway: I have to admit, I didn't like this song at first, but it's one of my favorites now. I wouldn't call it pop, but it's upbeat and fun to listen to. It has that \\"Green Day feel\\" to it, but there's something else about it, too... I love the   bass solo near the end. 9/10    6. Misery: I hated this song at first, mostly because it was different, but now I absolutely love it. It sort of sounds like a combination of Aladdin and the beginnings of American Idiot. Misery is basically about a bunch of people who have catastrophic things happen to them, then elope/die, etc. Tre, Mike, and Billie Joe must have had fun writing this one. 10+/10    7. Deadbeat Holiday: I'm not really sure exactly what this song's about, but I still like it. The lyrics are interesting- the song starts off with \\"Wake up, the house is on fire/and the cat is caught in the dryer\\" (a reference to Billie Joe's cat Zero, who died in the washing machine when he was a kid. Ouch.) 9/10    8. Hold On: Kind of an upbeat song that starts off with harmonica and hen transitions into catchy vocals. In a way I guess it's an anti-suicide song...in my opinion, it's a a lot better than Good Charlotte's \\"Hold On\\". 8/10    9. Jackass: A song about a person who thinks they're funny and always feel the need to be the center of attention. I love the lyrics...you can almost picture someone like that, very well written. And I love when Billie yells \\"alright!\\" and the song breaks into a saxophone solo.   8.5/10    10. Waiting: Good song, but by no means my favorite. It doesn't have that Green Day edge to it, and it's a bit poppy, but it goes to show that the band can play a wide variety of music. 7.8/10    11. Minority: From the minute I heard this on International Superhits, my first Green Day CD, I absolutely loved it. The vocals, the bass, the guitar, the percussion...it all fits together perfectly. The song is explosive and upbeat, and it's even got a little harmonica here and there. It talks about being an individual and not letting little things   get to you.  Definitely one of Green Day's best songs. 10+/10    12. Macy's Day Parade: A slower way to end an album, Macy's Day Parade is 100% acoustic guitar, with a little bass here and there, and hardly any percussion. Although many people may assume that it's a horrible song just by reading the description, it showcases how mature they can   be. Billie's voice sounds flawless, and although the bass line is simple, it really makes an impact on the song. 9/10    Overall, Warning is a great album that you definitely won't want to   miss. 10/10

0393035158|4.0|I bought End of Faith soon after it was released because 9/11 made me start thinking about religion and how it effects everyone, believer or not. <br />I agree with Sam Harris completely but as a layman without college education it was a hard read because of all the \\"50 dollar\\" words he used. I tired of looking up those words in the dictionary and just focused on the parts I could understand. <br />Mr. Harris is much smarter than me. He wrote the book as an intellectual writing for intellectuals. Most of the \\"masses\\" are the problem with religion, not being willing to study their own religions and others seriously and find the obvious faults and lies. <br />Hr. Harris did a fine job of telling the truth. Yet the people that need to know the stupidity of blind faith will never read End of Faith except for religious icons to tell their flock not to read the book. <br />But, having said that, Mr. Harris's book is the best written to combat faith whether people like myself can understand all of it. The end of religious intolerance needed a push, and Mr. Harris helped get it going with End of Faith.
B00000IMTF|5.0|This CD is just plain awesome. I listen to it all the time and am just amazed at the qaulity of musicianship it possesses. Rainbow is probably the best supergroup ever formed and this is their best album period. Even though *Rising* only clocks in a little more then a half-hour (it has only 6 songs), it is the supreme qaulity of these songs that make up for the short running time. I have to say that i enjoy every track on this except for maybe \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\", which is a filler song, but still not bad. My 3 favorites are \\"Tarot Woman\\", \\"Stargazer\\" and \\"Light in the Black\\". the last two tracks form sort of a mini epic story. \\"Stargazer\\" is about a wizard and \\"Light in the Black\\" is about his demise and his slaves excaping. Every member on this line-up is essentialy a virtouso at their instrament, yet there is no ego at all here and every one does there part to make this album amazing.   Ritchie Blackmore is the undisputed god of rock guitar, he completely shows his old Deep Purple mates that he can indeed form a band every bit as good and thenesome as his former one. RJD got his start with Rainbow and this is one of his best preformances in ANY band he has ever played with. Bain and Powell lock and gell together for a exellent rythm section and then there is Tony Carey, this guy is phenomenal on the keys! Here is my song rating for this god-like album:      < 10/10 > Tarot Woman      < 8/10 > Run w/ the Wolf      < 9/10 > Starstruck      < 7/10 > DO You Close Your Eyes      < 10/10 > Stargazer      < 10/10 > Light in the Black    Highest possible recommendation for anyone interested in classic rock. Oh yeah, and it was produced by Martin Birch, so you know it's gonna sound good too.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I had never been particularly interested or even heard a great deal of bluegrass music before listening to the soundtrack to \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" so I felt pretty indifferent to it at the beginning. Upon repeated listenings, however, the album became like an old friend, always there to pick you up and oftentimes stun you with its honesty. This is a diverse, wonderful disc, full of tracks both familiar and obscure that are incredibly likeable in their lack of pretense and purity of production. \\"Down to the River to Pray\\" is as moving a spiritual as anything I've ever heard, while \\"Didn't leave Nobody but the Baby\\" is a perfect little lullaby for adults, both made even more spectacular by Alison Krauss' achingly perfect voice. The reason this album came out of left field to become such a smash hit is because it's just a simple album full of quality songs that you remember. It really is great stuff, and a vital addition to any music collection.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|With great new record this year from Sufjan, Animal Collective and Bill Ricchini it is shaping up to be a banner year for Brooklyn based songwriters adn arranger-- what's in the water?!. At seventy-four minutes, Illinois is an exercise in patience; considering how long it takes to dog paddle through all the gooey orchestration, chugging through Stevens' meticulous arrangements and parsing out the melodies, Illinois is a bit of a commitment. Its 21 tracks consist of a handful of transitional snippets (many arresting in their own right), and plenty of good stuff (\\"The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulder\\", in particular) is buried way in the back, rewarding those who persevere, and in both theory and execution, Illinois is huge, a staggering collection of impeccably arranged American tribute songs. <br /> <br />

With over 275 Million albums sold Madonna has dominated charts around the world since her first album titled \\"Madonna\\" hit the streets back in the early 80's. Madonna has defined music in a way no artist since Elvis has. The \\"Music\\" CD is another work of art that no music lover should be without. People have loved her and loved to hate her from the beginning, with good cause she inspires and commands attention. She is after all Madonna. There is nothing like the REAL thing.

B000002JOH|1.0|I live in Antarctica, so good music is pretty hard to come by down in the ice laden frozen tundra of my home land. I had a very simple and normal life, until i heard metal for the first time and changed my life. Natuarly i was very exicted when i first started to listen to heavy metal music. If it wasn't for heavy metal, i would have no interst in music at all. I thought anyband that was capable of playing music in this gendre had to be extemely talented and capable with their instraments, and have years of practice and skill to make it..... <br /> <br />....then i heard Pantera..... <br /> <br />Wow, i mean, WOW, these guy were absolutley horrible! I could not belive what i was hearing! There music is \\"far beyond\\" absolute junk of the most horrendus kind! I gave my \\"Vulgar Display Of Power\\" CD to the polar bears that live in my back yard, they enjoyed crunching and munching it with their sharp teeth! These guys just have no talent at all, plain and simple. I can't understand how you blokes in America find these guys so popular, i mean they are just a bunch of dummies making noise, not metal! Good metal is suppoosed to have melody and form as well as a punch and an agressive qaulity, but Pantera fails at all of these! I don't condon violence at all, but no wonder this \\"Dime\\" guy was shot! he can't play guitar if his life depended on it, literaly, i'v heard better guitar players down here in my homeland of antarctica. And talk about horrible singing, this Phil Anselmo guy was abtrosious! This guy needs to get a job at the local gas station or start flipping burgers at Burger King, because he possesses no vocal talent at all! The polar bears down here have more singing ability with there primal roars and groans! Vinnie paul pounds the drum kit like a neandethal, boy is he talented or what?  At least Pantera showed me that not every one in metal has talent or playing ability, in fact, it sometimes is all about attitude and image, and Pantera has alot of that (but no musical talent). These guys act like they are so ToUgH and HaRdCoRe that it makes me laugh! Don't waste you money on thewe guys, its all a scam! These guys are just like Slipknot or Linkin Park, they are all about the gimmicks and silly stage presence rather then actaul music.
B000002KZA|4.0|This record it's really important for the band be cause they make a really start about their style ans their direction in the music. <br />with \\"speak and spell\\" and \\"a broken frame\\" you have no clear about the really essence of the band, you only have know that they are an electronic band, but you haven't know about the true feel and the true substance of the bands music. <br />A big help was the introducing of Alan Wilder
B00005JOHU|4.0|Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) sells international weaponry like he's selling used cars. If you don't like the deals from the former Soviet Union's stockpile of arsenal, you may be interested in a huge lot of discontinued assault rifles. How about unused guns and ammo from the U.S.-led aid to the Bosnian War? If you stick a gun in his face, he'll bring the price way down.<br /><br />\\"Lord Of War\\" is a cynical, yet not heartless and probably accurate portrayal of an American 'secondary market' international weapons dealer. Yuri globe-trots the world scooping up fantastic deals on abandoned and obsolete weaponry and peddles it off to third world countries where demand for blooldshed is high. His biggest competitor, he likes to joke, is The President of The United States.<br /><br />So you get a heavy dose of good-humored anti-war subtleties, with a highly entertaining movie thrown in for good measure. The first person narrative, sometimes spoken directly into the camera, offers an endless stream of topical one-liners. Some work, and some don't - \\"Buying your first gun is like making love for the first time. You don't know what you're doing, but you know you're having fun.\\" - or something to that effect. You eventually come away with a crash course in international arms dealing, that all the Time magazine issues in the world couldn't offer, sure to make you a more politically conscious observer. Exposure to the horrific results of weaponry in such an entertaining fashion is harsh, humane and like an unexpected needle from a doctor.<br /><br />Like a confident puppateer above the chaotic gunsmoke of war, Nicolas Cage reveals a believable and likable global arms dealer, who could be the same guy you saw selling a hot car radio in an ally. His scenes selling guns are nerve-bending as he makes bold physical and vocal gestures never riling dangerous warlords, while the slightest nervous tick could set off a slaughter. Bridget Moynahan's 'trophy wife' is anything but, an honest and touching portrayal of a rather superficial person coming to terms with her husband's means to wealth. I loved what she said about her failed careers and her stand against Yuri's profession, - \\"I have been a failed artist and a failed actress. I will not be a failed human being.\\" Eamonn Walker as Liberian dictator Andre Baptiste delivers a suave and vicious characterization as a man who will 'test drive' a new assault rifle by killing someone in the room with it.<br /><br />I went into this film mistakenly thinking it was the upcoming film, \\"Jarhead\\". I saw previews for both and confused the titles. A little troubled by my mistake, it was as if someone pointed a gun to my forehead and said, \\"watch this film instead.\\" I'm sold. Good deal!of a rather superficial person coming to terms with her husband's means to wealth.

6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the Shell is set in a future not that far from today, and some think that it is an accurate portrayal of the world that will come about in that time-frame.  It focuses on the idea of what will happen when technology becomes so powerful that humanity will fuse with it almost entirely.  The Internet is the technology used in Ghost in the Shell to show this in the best way.  When the Internet achieves such power, people start getting cybernetic brain implants to link their minds to it - thinking that it will make their life easier.  However, people always fail to realize that the more complex something becomes, the higher the chances that disorders will start to arise.  The Puppet Master - the so-called villain - is depicted as a type of disorder that arises from the vast sea of information created by the Internet.  Being aware of it's own existence, the Puppet Master can be called conscious or even alive, a valid point that it tries to make in this film.  And since it is the child born from the Internet, its goanna have access to everything linked to the Internet - meaning that it could hack into the minds of anyone who is connected.  A certain hack occurs that leaves a person with fake implanted memories.  But is it better to live a depressing reality or a happy and meaningful illusion? <br />Ghost in the Shell's two major protagonists are Kusanagi and Batou - both from an organization called Section 9, which deals with public security.  A film that is quite heavy in philosophy and somewhat mediocre in action, mixed with artificial intelligence and that dark, gloomy feeling - creating the perfect recipe and making it not only my favorite anime, but also my favorite motion picture. <br />
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is a great 2pac CD for someone new to pac.  The album has such classics as:  Ambitionz Az a Ridah, All About U, How Do U Want It, 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted, Life Goes On, Only God Can Judge Me, I Ain't Mad At Cha, Picture Me Rollin, and other great songs.    Note:  The California Love remix is terrible in my opinion!  My recommendation, replace it with the original that comes with Pac's Greatest Hits.    Song by Song:    Disc (Book) 1:  1) Ambitionz Az a Ridah, 10/10 - Classic  2) All About U, 10/10 - Classic  3) Skandalouz, 9/10   4) Got My Mind Made Up, 9/10  5) How Do U Want It, 10/10 - Classic  6) 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted, 10/10 - Classic  7) No More Pain, 9/10  8) Heartz Of Men, 9.5/10  9) Life Goes On, 10/10 - Classic:  One of my fav 2pac songs.  10) Only God Can Judge Me, 10/10 - Classic  11) Trading War Stories, 9/10  12) California Love (remix), 5/10 - Terrible!  Check the note.  13) I Ain't Mad At Cha, 10/10 - Classic!  14) Whatz Ya Phone # 4/10 - Great Disc ended with a filler, blah!    Disc (Book) 2:  1) Can't C Me, 9.5/10   2) Shorty Wanna Be a Thug, 10/10 - One of my favs from this album  3) Holla At Me 10/10, - Another fav of mine  4) Wonder Why They Call U Bitch, 10/10 - Yet another great one  5) When We Ride 8.5/10 - Ok, \\"featuring\\" the Outlawz  6) Thug Passion 9/10  7) Picture Me Rollin' 9.5/10 - Good Song  8) Check Out Time, 8.5/10 - Again \\"featuring\\" the Outlawz  9) Rather Be Ya Nigga, 10/10 - Great Song  10) All Eyez on Me, 9/10 - Outlawz again, ughh  11) Run Tha Streetz, 9.5/10 - The Lady on this song does a great job in my opinion.  12) Ain't Hard 2 Find, 9/10  13) Heaven Ain't Hard 2 Find, 9.5/10 - Another good one.    As you can tell I am not a fan of the Outlawz, but they at least did not ruin this album like Rated R ruined Thug Life Vol. 1    My Recommendation:  Pick this up immediately, it is a classic album and a great addition to any rap collection!
B000006TRV|1.0|Let me tell you something about this Cd, it is perfect if you suffer from insominia. I can't tell you how many times i'v literally fell asleep from listeing to this thing, trying to \\"get into it\\". How is it that this album so praised? Pink Floyd has struck me as nothing more then marketable drug addict rock desinged for the stoner crowd. Sadly, they are still as popular today as they were back then, and it now seems trendy to listen to Pink Floyd as well. <br /> <br />The Wall is the most boring P.O.S. i have ever listened to in my life. It is a retread of the album \\"Wish You Were Here\\", only more pretentious, more bloated and more mastrobatory. Wait, ...mastrobatory... that word in general perfectly sums up PF's music, but The Wall takes it to even greater and more pretentious heights. \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" gets almost more airplay then any other song i can think of, why? this song has no redeeming qaulity to it at all. The song is an attack on conformity, boy, that sure is original! I also had the unfortunate experience of also seeing The Wall movie, and i caan tell it is nearly as bad and mastrobatory as the album is. A rockstar doing drugs and going insane, wow, thats never been attempted before! This thing is even beating out the overrated DSOTM in a overindulgent mastrobation fest. What the hell was Roger Waters injecting into himself when he wrote this album? I'v owned this thing for years and have always meant to throw it away in the trash where it belongs but never got around to it, it has some how always been hanging around for some reason as a testament to remind me how horrible music can get at times. Avoid the P.O.S. like the plauge, and never let anyone tell you this thing is even remotly good or tell you to buy it. <br /> <br />In summary, this thing should of been a huge flop, but for some reason the drug addicts ate it up and now it is a \\"classic\\". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMJG|5.0|At first, I couldn't recognize Jim Carrey because he looked like a very ordinary guy. He played very nice and should play such kind of guys continuously in the future, I thought. The story was a little complicated to me because my mother tongue isn't English and I had to watch relying on subtitle.Though, I like this film very much. Everyone has a lot of faults and beauty and we have to accept those who are your precious people. I moved the last scene.

They are emotional and believable. I'm sure you will enjoy this film.

B000BI5LGE|5.0|If they made a live-action \\"Dilbert\\" movie, it might resemble \\"Office Space\\" -- a hysterically funny office film by Mike Judge (of \\"Beavis & Butthead\\" fame). Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job.<br /><br />Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss. His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell the pretty waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her. In an effort to relax, he accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under.<br /><br />The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy. He conspires with Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with no one the wiser. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly deranged employee who complains that \\"you took my stapler.\\" This time, Milton is a minor character, although a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech.<br /><br />Judge creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (\\"Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhh...\\"). This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field. And of course, the dialogue is quietly insane (\\"Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day...\\") as the plot grows ever tenser.<br /><br />The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his rage at his rotten job. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment that he has the same name as THAT singer. Jennifer Aniston does a pretty good job as a love interest for Peter -- a waittress who hates her job as much as he hates his.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles.

0446677450|1.0|Reading this book made me feel physically sick.    Why? Because I know that business, commerce, share and property trading are complex, constantly-evolving and often technical subjects.    This book is a simplistic story, seemingly an auto-biography, that it took me an afternoon to read.    I hated the style of the book. If I want to read about wealth creation, then please give me weath-creation, not a story about the good old days in Hawaii.    It made me shudder to think of all the poor folk out there who would like to know how to make money, who might think this could show them how.    As I said, if you are a child and know nothing about the meaning of assets or liabilities, this could illustrate to you the basic concept.    However, alot of people seem to find the interpretation of even those simple concepts flawed.    If you have even any passing familiarity with economic/business concepts, I can't see this helping you at all.    I would see a subscription to a business/money/finance magazine as being of much greater value to an adult as these generally will tell you of techniques to actually try making money rather than just vague principles.    Yes, we would all like to put our money into appreciating assets and live off the passive income, but I don't see that happening in a hurry for anyone but an exceptionally lucky few.    Having said all of that, this book and the whole rich dad/poor dad series is cleverly marketed, but that doesn't make it a good book, it just adds to my sense of nausea about it.    Because the book is so non-specific and basic, it is successfully marketed around the world.    An example being that I bought it in a thrift shop here in Australia, read it in an afternoon and then sold it for a few dollars more.    I guess that's about the sum value of this book.    I'd suggest anyone interested in this book should do some research and read some of the less-than-glowing reviews - they are alot closer to the mark than the hundreds of five-star reviews on Amazon. Could almost make you suspicious.
0030853222|1.0|\\"BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE\\" was assigned as my 9th grade Honors U.S. History II summer reading assignment.  My class was told that it would help to lead us into this chapter in our history class.  The first day of school, the teacher asked us how the book was coming along and found out firsthand just how open a class we are.  We all hated it.  It was terrible!  Every chapter tells a different tribe's story, but it was all the same.  This book was so repetitive.  There is a fight, there is a treaty, the whites break the treaty, there is another fight, and the Indians endure a terrible massacre.  I was saddened to read about the poor Indians, but it got a little old after the first 5 times or so.  Many of the people in my class are having so much trouble getting through the book, that they are either skimming through the book and risking the bad grade, or are buying the summary of each chapter off of a website.  The review on the front of the book reads, \\"...Impossible to put down.\\"  I found this true because after around 20 pages of reading this book, I would fall asleep with the book in my hand.  If you are planning to read this book, please understand how repetitive it is and rethink your decision.
B000286RNY|4.0|At first I couldn't believe that my son was recommending this movie to me. It really moved slowly at first during the first half.  That is with the exception of the woman making Chinese buns using Kung Fu.  I selected the Chinese version.  That's the best way I feel to see a movie in its original language with subtitles.  I didn't watch any more that day and came to it fresh the next day.  I found it highly entertaining and would recommend this movie.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|If Scenes from a memory was the flagship then this is the homeland!  If you are A) A DT fan or B) one wanting to know what DT is all about then this is the DVD/CD to get!  Beautifully designed and orchestrated this very professionally done DVD offers the best that DT has to offer.  This is a band that got to me years and years after it's conception.  Growing up in the Progressive rock scene I have heard of Dream Theater but never listened to them. After 11 years passed they are brought back to me again by a big fan of theirs.  At the offset they sounded 'OK' and they grew ever more enjoyable to listen to. This same friend invited me to a DT concert and I saw magic of a type I haven't seen since *cough* a Grateful Dead concert. &lt;grin>  This is a band with a true talent and knack.  The DVD gives a good insight to the band on the Bonus disk and an excellent show on the feature disk.  They are obviously trained in the musical arts so this disk should also be attractive to any musical student.  A diverse influential background coupled with passionate musical performances brings to you three hours that you'll want to play again and again just for pleasures sake!
B000957O82|4.0|Watching this movie made me think that I had seen it somewhere, even though I hadn't. When I got to thinking I realized that this movie is almost exactly like _How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days_. Taking this into consideration I continued watching and was glad that I had.     This is a great romantic comedy that should be watched and considered in its own light. Smith does a great job and the storyline is believable. The movie brings out emotions, which is a sign of a good movie. The premise, itself, is a good premise, being more uplifting, and leads to a feel good sense at the end of the movie. It is also refreshing to see a movie where it is the woman that messed things up, rather than the man, even though it was the man that had to go to her in the end. This just isn't done too much which gives a nice take to a well played out theme.     Despite, or because of, the familiar ring to _How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days_, I give this a four star. A fun loving, feel good romantic comedy that I would definitely recommend.
0790731452|4.0|Though it's certainly not among Tim Burton's greatest works, Mars Attacks! is, in many ways, the perfect follow-up to his masterpiece Ed Wood, because it's a direct homage to every trashy sci-fi B-movie from the 40's, 50's and 60's, and Mr. Wood's own works are high on that list. It's a common error that Mars Attacks! was intended as a spoof on Independence Day, which was a huge hit that very same year, and was in fact produced and filmed at the same time; of course, Mars Attacks! spoofs the very same films that Independence Day paid homage to, even if, as many have already noted, it's actually officially based on trading cards from the late 60's, which inspired the way the Martians look. In Mars Attacks! Mr. Burton shows the kind of pop-culture sensitivity we're more accustomed to seeing in Quentin Tarantino's work, with relatively very little of his own vision and motives in it; he does a master job of copying the style of the horrible films he loved so much as a child, and so even though it's his least personal film - to that point, that is - there's also quite a bit of him in it, though not in the way that we're used to from Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and even Batman. <br /> <br />Tim Burton lets himself loose on Mars Attacks! like no other movie since Pee Wee's Big Adventure. It's strictly visual comedy, and just like Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, the success of the film is first and foremost due to his direction, and very little thanks to the script, which is minimal and quite simplistic. Burton gathered an all-star cast which includes Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Jack Black, Lisa Marie, Rod Steiger, Annette Bening, Michael J. Fox, Denny DeVito, Pierce Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jim Brown, Martin Short, Pam Grier, Natalie Portman and Tom Jones in a fantastic performance as himself, and with the help of that cast he created what may just be his most outright hilarious comedy, which is also a clever and subtle parody. It's not essential viewingbut it's one hell of a wild ride and probably Tim Burton's most easily accessible work.
0385338686|2.0|I enjoyed the Shopaholic series tremendously. I will never forget bursting out in laughter in the middle of my doctor's waiting room when Becky Bloomwood tried to speak in Norwegian (or whatever language she'd pretended to know on her application!) <br />I was very excited about this new book of Kinsella's and I must say I was rather disappointed. While the book has its moments, everything about it sounds so highly improbable that I was not put into a state of willing suspension of disbelief (like I was with Shopaholic) - so the book started to really drag for me barely a quarter into the story. As I said, there are a few salvageable moments and some good lessons to be learned about enjoying life and stopping to smell the roses, but I am hoping Becky Bloomwood will make a comeback.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood, the irrepressible director of bad movies such as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. He never shoots a scene twice, and never gives up no matter how bad the reviews. Wood surrounds himself with a crew of misfits and other Hollywood rejects, all of whom are absolutely hilarious. Wood himself fits right in due to his habit of dressing up in woman's clothing. The movie is shot in B & W, in order to capture the feel of the time. The highlight is undoubtedly Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi; Landau must have channeled the spirit of Lugosi for this stunning performance, full of depth and tragic-comic pathos. The relationship between Lugosi and Wood is quite touching. The greatest strength of this movie is all the wonderful quirky characters who help Wood make his movies. Amusing and even hilarious---not in a laugh-out-loud-rolling-on-the-floor way, but with a richer and deeper humor that stays with you.
0060872675|5.0|I loved this book and would read it to my younger children with no problems at all.  The story line really appeals to children with a sense of humour (my five year old will love it!)  The theme of where's my Daddy is familiar to them from a few books so the alterations and the 'citifying' of it just makes it more fun than the bland versions they have had until now. <br />The illustrations are superb!  So what if the characters don't fit the mould you imagined them to be, does every film character look as you imagined from the book?  The child is brilliant and so true to life and Sam is wonderful (as are all the others) and done just right so that they appeal to children - for whom book was officialy written anyway. <br />Well done author and illustrator for a lovely book.
B00005N5S5|4.0|A cyborg from the future (Arnold Schwartzeneggar) and a human soldier (Michael Biehn) travel back in time to battle over the life of a woman (Linda Hamilton) whose son will one day lead the human rebellion.  This classic SF action picture put both Schwartzeneggar and writer/director James Cameron on the map, and rightfully so.  The script is efficient and lean, moving effortlessly from thrill to thrill with not a wasted scene in between action set pieces.  This film was clearly made on a budget, but the effects hold up well, even today./
B000A3DFZE|5.0|In Classic Clapton fashion, Mr Guitar God has done it again.  This album delivers more of the proved formula delivered in recent albums like Reptile and Pilgrim. In there is a mix of Pop sounds, with some blues for us \\"Blues hungry\\"  I must say I am entirely satisfied with this latest delivery.  Now, I can only expect the next, which I hope will be another Blues CD. <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I tried to watch this TV show when it first came out. The network killed it quick. The Boneheads at FOX would not know what a great show was even if it hit them in the face. Firefly was and still is a Great Show. I love the DVD set and I am half way through the seasons. I hope a smart network will consider taking on such a show as Firefly.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|I can't believe this doesn't have better reviews. I gave this five stars because every song on this release is just killer. Cannibal have gotten more technical then I ever imagined, and I've been a fan since the first album. I haven't seen these guys live since WAY back on the Tomb of The Mutilated tour; I'd love to see this entire album performed live. It's that good. Alex Webster's bass playing has become insane, and Corpsegrinder's vocals are not only more brutal than ever but better in the sense that you can actually hear each word without turning to the lyrics, and he still manages to belt out that classic Death Metal growl. If you are at all serious about your Death Metal collection, then make sure this is in it. One of the best releases of 2004. 5 Stars!
B000002UCN|5.0|This is a great cd if you don't want to take your entire Harrison collection with in the car.
B00000064G|5.0|This is a quiet, haunting, intimate, sparse, spooky, lulling, uneasy album by one of the greatest (previously) undiscovered talents of the 1970s.  The sound is so simple and spare you might not even hear it if it's on and you're not paying attention, but if you give it your full attention, you'll find yourself being overpowered, and falling in love.<br /><br />All of Nick Drake's albums are good, but this one, on which he strips away everything unneeded--strips away all the sappy smooth jazz saxophone or unnecessary strings--and leaves only a defeated yet hopeful voice, a masterfully fingerpicked lo-fi guitar, and a piano note here and there, is his most cohesive, coherent, perfect album.  If this were the only thing he had ever recorded, his name would live in music history forever.  If this were the only album you ever bought, your money would not have been wasted.<br /><br />Every one of these songs evoke emotion.  You will feel dark nights, empty parking lots, feet crunching through gravel, lost loves, and times you can never go back to.<br /><br />You will feel like you know Nick Drake personally, and that feeling won't be wrong.
0385507755|1.0|I read this book in two days hoping against hope it would get better or have some sort of climax.  I was not at all impressed with Frey's writing style or his muitilation of grammar and punctuation.  It was repetitive, self absorbing and predictable. I do not think he is a literary genius.  I had no idea this was one of \\"Oprah's Must Reads\\" until I got up to the counter to pay for it and noticed the sticker on the front cover.  Seeing that alone almost made me put it back.  I was so bored with the relentless \\"cravings\\" and desires to destroy himself. Addiction is a choice and the reason people choose not to quit is because it's hard, it's VERY hard to break an addiction.  However it's still a personal choice.  This book made Best Seller because so many people believe in the psycho babble crap that's out there today; thanks to the \\"Dr. Phil's, Oprah's and Network News\\". It's always everyone else's fault; or George Bush's fault and not their own.  The severe lack of personal accountability in this country and all the people who buy into it is what's destoying this country.  The, \\"It's all about ME attitude\\" is the worst addiction we face today.  If you're interested in reading an exceptionally well written, honest, heart felt substance abuse book, I highly recommend, \\"Dry\\" by Augusten Burroughs.  Now there's a writer.
B0000024R8|5.0|I absolutely hate the 1960s folk revival.  I hate the flood of no-talent young singers and musicians that coursed into Greenwich Village in the early-1960s with a wide sweep of crummy albums in their wakes.  Joan Baez.  The Clancy Brothers.  Peter, Paul, and Mary.  And all of the others who slightly altered classic folk songs so they could give themselves arrangers' credits.<br /><br />That said, this could have been an awful album.  It consists mostly of old time folk songs, and it was covered right when all these other legions of no-talents were recording their similarly conceived albums.<br /><br />But, as it happened, this is not only NOT awful, it's exceptional.  It's astounding.  That's because it was recorded by a young Bob Dylan, his voice so rough and raw and ragged, and his heart rising into every word, his guitar perfect though basic, and his harmonica frantic and soul-filled.  The folk songs he covers here have never been covered so skillfully: I believe them when he sings them.  He sings them as if he wrote them.  And the originals--the originals!--especially \\"Song to Woody\\" are heartfelt tributes and musical masterpieces that brim with the potential that would later explode through subsequent albums.<br /><br />Bob Dylan is a classic, and this, his first album, screams out exactly who he is, and who he wanted to become.  It's a great introduction to him, it's Bob's voice at its rawest, and it remains a favorite of mine despite knowing almost all the other albums he's recorded since.<br /><br />If you've haven't heard it yet, it's time to hear it now.  Right now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Absolutely delightful, and is worth watching. And if you like it, go see Serenity, out in theatres.
B000002N1E|5.0|[...]<br />Prince is my favourite musician of all time. I love music, go to gigs all the time and all my spare cash gets spent on either CD's or DVD's. And even though I love other albums and artists, it's always Prince I go back to the most.<br /><br />The Gold Experience is arguably not Prince's best album (the cliche is, of course, to say Sign O' The Times), but its The Curmudgeon's personal favourite, because not only does it still hook you in with its irresistable opening song P. Control (an outrageous spin on girl power.. put it this way, the \\"P\\" is another name for a cat.  Mm-hmm.) to the heartbreakingly gorgeous finale of Gold, but because it brings back so many memories of when I first listened to it on its original day of release. I knew from the opening few beats that I had just bought something very special indeed.<br /><br />This is Prince's first album under the Artist Formerly Known As name (which, by the way, I LOVED everything about.. the idea, the way he brought it into his music, everything. In fact - rare Curmudgeonly scoop - I have the Prince symbol tattooed on my arm). As a result, its full of \\"Prince is dead\\" type messages, but lets talk about the music some more.<br /><br />Prince's only UK number one (Jesus, how sad is THAT?!) The Most Beautiful Girl In The World, gets another airing and different mix, (already available in a single and 8 different versions on The Beautiful Experience EP), as well as axed single Dolphin, a gorgeous pop song with some superb lyrics and guitar - a real shame this was never heard on the radio.<br /><br />18 tracks in all, there isn't much in the way of filler, even if Billy Jack Bitch turns into a bit of a tedious noise near the end. The likes of Shy, Eye Hate U and Now will have you playing this album for YEARS.<br /><br />You need it in your life.<br /><br />(...)
4893581198|5.0|I'm studying japanese since a year and kanji is for sure the hardest part, but this book gives, luckily, a real help: it is structured in a clear way(about 10 kanji per lesson,exercises, and notes about their use in everiday's life),and there are also pictures to help you memorizing and understanding kanji. <br />I bought it on amazon.com from the seller Jumpingbee, who was very kind to me, and it also arrived in a very short time: <br />Sugoi ne!!! (it means great!!!)
B00005JNY4|3.0|\\"Into the Blue\\" met my expectations, but only because I walked into the theater with realistic ones. One can tell by the trailer that this isn't really a great movie. But it is adequate. And can you really give a bad review to a movie that has Jessica Alba either in a bikini or tight shorts and a tight tanktop for 80% of the time? I certainly could not. <br /> <br />And that's where the eye candy comes in, which is this movie's best asset. Eye candy in terms of the sex appeal of the leading characters, but also the excellent shots of the island, especially the underwater scenes. The underwater action sequences and footage is nothing short of impressive. One warning though: the shark attack scenes are quite graphic and explicit, on the same level of goriness as the shark attack scene in \\"The Beach.\\" Those who are overly squeamish are advised to look the other way during these scenes. But don't let that stop you from seeing the movie...there are only a couple of them. <br /> <br />I would recommend \\"Into the Blue\\" to: <br />-any Jessica Alba fan <br />-any moviegoer who doesn't mind putting their brain on neutral and enjoying the ride <br />-fans of underwater action flicks <br /> <br />Not a must-see, but entertaining for what it is.
B0001AP158|4.0|If you want to see Bon Jovi in a relaxed, more intimate venue connecting with the audience like never before while performing a new rendition of some of their biggest hits, this is the DVD to watch! Jon's delivery in a crooner ( la Sinatra) style of some of his hugest hits like 'You Give Love a Bad Name', 'Livin' On A Prayer', 'Bad Medicine', and 'Keep the Faith' is nothing short of fantastic. He performs 'Last Man Standing', which until the release of Bon Jovi's new CD - Have  A Nice Day - he had never performed live, with heart and soul. And his performance of an old, pop cover song - Sylvia's Mother - is the icing on an already very sweet cake!
B000B0WODA|4.0|On the second album, Franz ditches the crystaline Television-meets-Gang of Four guitar style of the first album and goes into rawer, more experimental territory, focusing on creating new sounds as opposed to just writing catchy atonal riffs.  One of the tracks that jump out at me right away is \\"Evil and a Heathen\\", which displays a totally fresh angle of the band.  This track is creepy, punky, danceable, glammy, and a swirling pit of throbbing rock and roll all at the same time.  There is also a prominent Brian Eno Warm Jets-era influence throughout the album (makes me hope that Eno will produce their third album!).  Despite the exciting new sonic advances the band make during the album, it is also soiled with forgettable and insipid singles such as \\"Do You Want To\\" and \\"YCHISMB\\" that clearly try to emulate the form of their highly successful first single \\"Take Me Out\\".  Franz Ferdinand is the one band of the modern age that I heartily respect, because of their ability to sound catchy and accessible yet cerebral and complex, as opposed to The Killers, the blander, vanilla version of FF.  Their new direction is an exciting one, and I eagerly await more from this band. <br />(As a sidenote, I do enjoy \\"Do You Want To\\" more live because the band ditches the corny intro for a tease of Captain Beefheart's \\"Hot Head\\")
B0009XT8YW|5.0|Product arrived promptly.  In excellent condition.  Would use this vendor again.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|After reading several reviews of this play right here on Amazon and seeing that almost all of them have rated this as a 5-star collection, I had to hear if for myself. I was skepitcal at first, but then I thought this many people can't be wrong. I was speechless after hearing the first few songs. It takes a lot to impress me when it come to Broadway, and this has far suppassed what I first expected. My favorite songs are the same as almost everyone else's. I don't want to sound redundent, but as with anything that is phenominal it is worth repeating, over and over again. My personal favorites are \\"What Is This Feeling,\\" \\"Defying Gravity,\\" \\"Popular,\\" and one that isn't mentioned, \\"Dancing Through Life.\\" But the two most exceptional tracks on here are \\"For Good\\" because it shows how two very different people overcome the barrier of difference and put aside the blame and end up as best friends, and last but best is \\"As Long As Your Mine.\\" Ok, call me cheesy, but this song reminds me of how I still feel for my husband. Nothing matters too much as long as we continue loving and being there for each other. That's what this song is all about, loving each other above anything else, in spite of your differences. I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of this play in my city. It will be breathtaking as the CD certainly has been!! <br />
0880796863|5.0|If you are learning Tarot for the first time, the Rider-Waite deck provides the most direct and unadorned visual basics for learning to interpret the cards.  The accompanying text is not terribly helpful for the novice as it speaks to a turn-of-the century group of people who were already well versed in the symbolism of the tarot images.  However, it does act as an interesting reference to the era inwhich these cards were released.  The books by Eden Grey and Rachel Pollack are much better sources for the beginner. <br /> <br />If you're looking for images to please the eye, this deck is probably not for you, but if you're looking for a good foundation in learning the meanings of the cards this is an excellent deck, made of good stock and coated to withstand a lot of use and abuse.
0446691437|4.0|\\"The War of Art\\" by Steven Pressfield is a great book about overcoming your fears of doing what you were put on this planet to do.  Mr. Pressfield introduces the concept of \\"Resistance\\" to be that voice in our head that always holds us back from doing the things that would take us to the next level in our life.<br /><br />Part 2 goes through how to overcome \\"resistance\\" and take that next step.  A lot of the advice in this section is good but has been stated before.  I also would have liked some practical applications like what to do to help overcome fear.<br /><br />Part 3 talks about living a life that has put fear in check.  This section was my least favorite of the 3 but it still had some good advice such as how to determine if what you are doing is your real calling.<br /><br />Overall, this is an easy read with a lot of good advice.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to overcome their fears and do what they know has to be done.  4 out 5 stars.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|Every song is good in its own way. You can listen to it all the way through. Definately different than thier last album but worth purchasing.
B0006399FS|4.0|Guys, Lets face it...it is not possible for a band (not even U2)to make a Joshua Tree or an Achtun Baby out of every album they release. But from there to say that \\"U2 has lost it\\"...there is a huge HUGE gap. <br /> <br />I think that we are forgetting the fact that U2 doesn't need to sell records anymore...so I am assuming that if they are still together, it is mainly because they still enjoy making music and not because they are looking for the \\"easy way out of selling records\\". <br /> <br />With that being said, I think that this is certainly not the best album from U2, but still it is a pretty solid album, very fun to listen and very enjoyable...specially considering that these 4 guys still can have fun and rock at the same time in their 40s. <br /> <br />I would have given this one 3.5 stars...but since there's no such an option...I am leaning towards 4 stars... 3 is average, and U2 could be anything but an average band.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|This is an extraordinary finale from a legendary singer and performer, full of daring and soul.  Cash takes songs of others, some seemingly uncharacteristic, and makes them his own.  The arrangements are spare but not stark; he can still rock you when he wants to.  Nor is it all dead serious; he is still funny when he so chooses.  To the extent the set is tinged by death, it is not so in the sense of a man who feels he missed something.  It is only so in its directness, being past any subterfuge concerning who he was and what he was about.  The masks he put on here are a way of saying what he wants to say with more freedom.<br /><br />The extreme reactions to this record you see by some on amazon.com are an interesting barometer (even when negative) to the set's power.  While musically Cash will always be remembered as something of \\"a man in black,\\" even to articulate that role is to return to the genre of the classic western:  good guys and bad.  But the bad guys were just the great actors who helped tell the story of the heroes, of course.  The genre of such clear moral demarcation now survives only in space fantasies like Star Wars and Star Trek, this generation's \\"westerns.\\"  The western itself, to the extent it survives, is usually populated by anti-heroes and other shades of gray.  Here in Cash's closer, he clearly places himself back in the classic frame -- all the songs are rather unambigous -- \\"no funny business.\\"  Thus while Johnny finally covered Simon and Garfunkle, he could never have covered Kurt Cobain (which is not, however, to say he might not have tried, had he lived longer).  Doubtless his final refusal (some would call it inability) to embrace the sliding moral scale of the anti-hero, much less outright nihlism, is a shock to some.  So probably is the raw, unadorned passion (still with an edge of menace) of an aged man -- something also often not depicted in a media culture which is increasingly concerned only with the very young.  The reviewers, then, who laugh or scoff have indeed been touched by this legendary gunslinger's last shot -- perhaps better to say zapped -- as he went charging into the sunset.<br /><br />Everybody will have different views of which are the best cuts, which less successful.  Since Cash was experimenting to the end, it is fair to say that not all of them work.  You would give it 5 stars if honesty and integrity were the only criterion, however.<br /><br />It does seem reasonable to speculate however that the title song, Danny Boy, Desperado, and Tear Stained Letter would make very serious contenders for a 2 record retrospective or greatest hits collection from this long career.  Seeing such brilliance at an artist's end is always a beautiful thing to see.  The cover of Desperado, which is almost just the cadence of a spoken word recital while still music, is beyond belief.  It is also an entire summation and signature by Cash on his whole story.ho laugh or scoff have indeed been touched by this legendary gunslinger's last shot -- perhaps better to say zapped -- as he went charging into the sunset.

Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun... <br />You can't help but shrink back into your seat, heart thudding with the suspense, hands gripping the armrests tightly as you await the next victim's fate with bated breath.  <br />Well, that's the effect this movie has on me EVERY TIME I WATCH it with a home cinema system on widescreen. Jam-packed with gruesome and shocking deaths and famous scenes and quotes, Jaws is the ultimate adventure/horror film. Spielberg scared the nation out of skinny dipping in the sea with this amazing and powerful movie, and it is not in the slightest bit dated.  <br />The awe as you behold the full size of the shark for the first time, as various chracters are approached from the depths, as Brody, Hooper and Quint go head-to-head with the beast; it's all great. Nothing is the same once you've watched this once, or twice, or however many times.  <br />A true masterpiece in film making- a \\"slasher\\" with a difference.  <br /> <br />GO WATCH IT! NOW! <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|My son got his father and I hooked on this show after the DVD was given to his girlfriend.  Halfway through watching her copies, we decided we had to have our own.  And yes, I am an original Star Trek fan-saw the first episode the first time it was shown!  Also saw the original Star Wars the first week it was shown, so you can see how ancient we are! <br /> <br />The stories are both heartrending and funny-sometimes at the same time.  Even though it may seem strange to have Western elements like leather vests and revolvers mixed in with space ships and psychics, in the context of the frontier where they live (aka \\"edge of the Black\\"), it is very believable and appealing.  These are the real people the Enterprise only met on occasion and the people Han, Luke and Anakin would have been if they had not encountered the Force.  Also, like the Enterprise and the Millenium Falcon, the ship, Serenity, is also a character in the show.  She is truly a Firefly, generating all the excitement a child experiences trying to catch one on a midsummer's night. <br /> <br />Cancelling this show, after messing around with it like Fox did, deprived all of us of a wonderful experience.  Joss Whedon obviously had so much more to say.  And already said more than most TV shows say on years of episodes.
B00000265X|4.0|wow. talk about the ultimate guilty pleasure...but i just don't care! i still get excited whenever the opening keyboard strains of the title track float out of the stereo. there's just something about a hard rock pop song done right! and Europe certainly had the formula down. it didn't hurt matters when you have a terrificly charismatic frontman like Joey Tempest and the amazing guitar work of John Norum. the cheese factor reaches an all time high in the middle of the album where the listener is hit with the dreadful back-to-back punch of \\"Ninja\\" and \\"Cherokee.\\" ouch. but you can't help but sing along with a mixture of humour and self-disgust (because you know all the words...hahah). but the next track \\"Time has Come\\" has a killer melody and actually gets stuck in my head more times than i care to admit. this album is probably Europe's most focused (and most succesful) record to date. it contains a bit more of a punch than their previous releases and is easier to listen to than their bloated follow up of \\"Out Of This World.\\"

B000002LRX|5.0|an absolute monumental release that is so good that it's impact can hardly be described in words. the best elements of pop, death metal, funk, and longue music are combined into one big fantastic beast of an album. this random \\"everything goes\\" formula could have proved fatal for most bands, but Faith No More were never like most bands. this is a true masterpiece delivered with grace, humor, intelligence, and, oh yea..style.
B0007GAERG|3.0|I enjoy Mariah Carey's voice.  She can hit high notes like nobody else.  I would have enjoyed this CD much, much more if I could have heard more of Mariah, and less of the backup singers and music and everything else.  Only on Track 9, Circles, do I really hear Mariah's voice. <br /> <br />Whomever designed the cover photo needs an award.  That is the nicest and sexiest cover of the year.  Mariah is a beautiful woman, and that really showes her off.
B000001FSP|4.0|what a great album. the music sounds like Blondie or The Police on downers and the intensity and unrest erupts to a boiling point on the furious album closer \\"Why D'ya Do It?\\" the touching \\"Ballad Of Lucy Jordan\\" is a fine a fine showcase for Faithfull's whiskey ravaged voice; giving the proceedings a kind of Billie Holiday-esque charm. a respectable contribution to the world of rock and still influential to many bands almost 25 years later!
0684857219|4.0|This is the first book to read cover to cover when looking to start a weight training program.  It amazes me to no end that people will look to commit to a program that will take at least 5 hours a week, and not spend a couple of hours planning the proper course of action to take. <br />A word to all is to take several points into consideration, and realize that there are different methods and philosophies in this as well as all things.  For instance, I believe that the program in this book is overtraining a bit.  This in no way decreases the value of the exercise instructtion, motivation, and history lessons that this book gives.
B0009UVBQI|5.0|I read a few reviews of Kung Fu Hustle before deciding to buy it. They were universal in their praise but probably failed to capture the full charm of the film. The opening is a bit disconcerting in its brutality. I thought, 'oops!', but advise viewers to hang on in there - it only lasts about 5 minutes but it is enough to ensure we know the depths of depravity and evil of the bad guys. The film then moves into its true tale - one of appearances being deceptive and that fame of the sort sought by the hero is illusion. The film uses obvious symbolism. The hero is a loser who wants to join the bad boys' Axe Gang, but he has such innate goodness that all his endeavours to become foul enough to belong fail. He does, however, have one talent they need and this talent allows him to join the gang.  <br />The slum where much of the action takes place has a kind of lunatic charm, ruled by the most awful landlady and her comic husband, it and they are another case of the deceptive nature of appearances. Our hero eventually comes into his own becoming a hero we can all enjoy - truly magnificent!  <br />There are references to other films, which do not detract from the delight we take in this happily ever after story, in fact I take a particular pleasure in noting influences, 'Matrix' and even old 'Monkey Magic' touches.  <br />Virtue is rewarded and the bad guys suitably punished and all is well with the world. One leaves the film with a lighter step and laughter in your heart - not a bad mood to enjoy!

Who made you pay $40 for each season when Amazon ALWAYS sold it for less?  If you're that miserable about your covers, sell all your seasons to someone else on Amazon and buy the Collector's Giftset for yourself (it'll cost a whole lot less than a pair of Manolo Blahnick's!!)

0975991477|5.0|The Biology of Belief is the journey of a scientist into the realm of the spiritual.   It takes us beyond the typical dogma of the medical profession into the domain of new thought and holistic healing.   Dr. Lipton gives many scientific examples proving that energy does indeed influence the body, much more so than our DNA and our inherited gene-pool does.   <br /> <br />I liked this book so much because of the scientific content (though I have to admit to having difficulty in digesting some of his information).    This is definitely not an \\"airy-fairy\\" book on the Law of Attraction, but a scientific resource into the \\"whys\\" and \\"hows\\" of the science of positive thinking.      <br /> <br />Dr. Lipton's writing is enjoyable and easy to understand, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone on the journey of personal healing and enlightenment. <br />
B00025ETIW|1.0|I'd never bought an album that wasn't from a band that originated in the 70s or 80s, so I gave this one a shot. WOW, I just wasted 15 bucks! This album, which features a gay singer, should've never been released! From beginning to end, I felt depressed, and who wants that? I'd rather listen to My World from Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion II.
B00005221L|5.0|When I was younger a friend told me about a monster that came from outer space and hunted humans, taking their skulls as trophies and moving with the greatest agility and speed. The monster he was talking about (of course) was the inimitable and lethal \\"Predator.\\" And that's when I decided to rent the 1987 release of \\"Predator\\" on VHS for the first time - and all I can say is that I was dumbfounded - and am still mightily impressed today...<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, a hardened special-ops commander who has experienced much violence and conflict during  his life. This time Dutch is called by the CIA to rescue hostages held by viscious guerrillas in Central America. His team are inserted deep behind enemy lines to accomplish their mission. However, once the mission is completed, Dutch discovers that the whole hostage story was a cover-up and is outraged by this turn  of events. However, it is not Dutch's hurt ego or anger that becomes his biggest problem. It seems that there is some kind of creature hunting him and his men, and one by one his team of experts are picked off by something that is clearly not of this Earth. Dutch will have to use all of his past experiences, military training and wit to survive this seemingly hopeless situation...will he be victorious, or will this hunter claim his skull as his ultimate prize? The storyline is enthralling and certainly creates interest. There's no fooling around and John McTiernan presents a believable and direct story that ensures plenty of action and drama. 10/10 for the storyline!<br /><br />Another interesting thing about \\"Predator\\" is the relationships and conflicts that exist between Dutch and his team members. For example, Mac and Dylan don't get along at all while Billy and Dutch seem to understand and appreciate each other. This makes the audience believe that this team really is experienced and that they are familiar with each other. It also presents their individual traits and personalities with great effect. This also adds to the realism, drama and impact of the film as a whole and so Predator gets another 10/10 for its clever structure and sub-plots.<br /><br />Now the Predator himself is amazing: he's tall, silent, tough as s*** and armed to the teeth with some incredible otherworldly technology. He's more than a worthy opponent for Dutch and his crew, and every aspect of the Predator is interesting, terrifying and awe-inspiring. We also see through the eyes of the Predator, we \\"become him\\" during certain periods. We see how he sees, in a thermal vision which makes spotting prey all the easier. We also get a glance at his weapons, such as his wristblades and shoulder cannon. His active camoflauge from his shift suit does not make him invisible, but it does cause light to bend around him, making him nearly undetectable. The medikit he uses contains various medical devices, but it seems he prefers to suture and burn his wounds shut in order to continue in his hunt. The attention to detail on the Predator character is simply phenomenal, and we actually learn alot about this violent yet intelligent invader through this film. McTiernan has developed and presented believable and interesting, multi-dimensional, complex characters; and the Predator is certainly unsurpassed as a character in the genre of Sci-Fi. It's just total genius, what can I say?<br /><br />The fight scenes are fueled with action and energy, and the showdown between Dutch and the Predator is epic to say the very least. The film is not overly complex in its approach, but this is perfect since \\"Predator\\" is a no-holes-barred, to-the-point and brilliant film that totally rips other Sci-Fi Action movies to luminous green shreds.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Predator\\" gets a pure platinum 97% in my opinion. It's just great and a movie you will watch over and over again. It's a fascinating, action-packed, enthralling, exciting and wonderful Sci-Fi flick. This movie is unquestionably a must for all fans of the Sci-Fi genre. This movie has it all and even the special-effects are impressive, even today. So what are you doing reading this? Go rent or buy \\"Predator,\\" right now, otherwise I may have to take your skull as MY trophy...for all fans of the Sci-Fi genre.

B000002H97|1.0|Following a lackluster \\"...And Justice for All\\", they follow up with this drivel. i admit, i bought it. i loved it.<br /><br />But, Kill 'Em All and Master of Puppets remained in rotation in my CD player. This album, over time, proved NOT to be timeless like the older albums. Metallica had proven how long they prayed at the altar of the record industry. They sold out. They abandoned us who considered ourselves fans.
B000002B35|3.0|No doubt, Pink Floyd can pull off one hell of a rock concert, and I've only seen them on video!  Their songs are great and the laser lights show is unmatched by any other band.  Listening to their live album 'Pulse', I couldn't help but wonder if this is still the real Pink Floyd.  It makes no sense to release a live album where the songs sound exactly the same as they do on the studio album.  Listen to The Who or the Greatful Dead; their live songs are much more original and interesting then their studio songs.  They offer something new and refreshing.  No reason to buy a live album if it sounds exactly like the studio stuff, unless one likes to hear the croud cheer in the background.<br />I guess \\"Pink Floyd\\" was trying to make a few extra bucks from the songs and ideas of Roger Waters.  It seems like \\"Pink Floyd\\" accomplished at that goal.

6305308659|4.0|I thought the basic concept of this movie was brilliant--the dull, monochrome town's gradual and unwilling conversion to full color serving as a metaphor for the often painful vicissitudes and realities that change can bring. But for the town's residents, those changes also offer a fuller and more adult appreciation of life--such as the discovery of sex.<br /><br />The people of Pleasantville, previously trapped in their dull, boring, limited, Leave it to Beaver lives, are at first bewildered, and then aghast, at the insidious plague of color that is creeping into their predictable little monchrome universe. A few residents aren't afraid, and are more curious, such as Toby's mother and the soda shop owner, but most regard the new changes with a growing sense of dread, as they watch their previously cozy little world start to fall apart.<br /><br />In the end, of course, their efforts are unable to stem the inexorable tide of color change and Pleasantville is finally reborn in the light of a new day in bilious, full color. The townspeople's wonder and amazement at their glorious new polychrome universe is palpable, and the movie ends on a happy note.<br /><br />After the movie, I had an odd recollection. The rebirth in full color recalled childhood memories of Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color show from the early 60s, the first all-color syndicated TV series, if I remember right, which came out when I was about 12. I found myself wondering what Disney would have thought of this movie, because he was the first person to bring the full potential of color TV to the American public, and the show is about a monochrome TV world that experiences the same change. I found myself imagining the great cartoonist and animator sitting there musing, \\"This is just a movie about a fictional town, but in a sense, I actually did it in the real world.\\" :-)<br /><br />As someone here said earlier, Pleasantville is one of the greatest underrated flicks ever. The way the people and the objects in the film were gradually colorized is a delight to watch, and overall, the film's idea is one of the most creative ones to emerge from Hollywood in recent years.ally colorized is a delight to watch, and overall, the film's idea is one of the most creative ones to emerge from Hollywood in recent years.
B000003TA4|1.0|i have to wholeheartedly agree with those who question the 5-star ratings for this CD. This cd went in and out of the charts like the bullet that permeated Kurt Cobain's brain. Forgotten, collecting dust of the shelves of countless 20-somethings who bought it (or begged mom to buy it for them).<br /><br />The only lasting legacy that Curt Cobain has left on me is his annoying, disease-ridden ex-wife. God, how i WISH she'd join him!<br /><br />This is mindless, rythymless crap. A one hit wonder and i still wonder why.

B0009QTS1M|5.0|Gladiator.  The story, the cinematography, the acting; all amazing.  But we knew this before the new DVD came out.  Why would a studio re-release a film that has already done so well in DVD sales.  Is this some cop-out to make more money?  Is this an attempt to 'fool' us into thinking its an entirely new movie?  Maybe...but you know what, I sure enjoyed it! <br /> <br />With a small disclaimer by Ridley Scott before the film, letting the viewer know that \\"this is not a director's cut\\", the movie still plays through weaving an even more elaborate and engaging story. <br /> <br />I could go on at length about how this film is and continues to be my favorite, or about how it inspired me to start my own filmmaking career...but I don't want to drag this review out. <br /> <br />THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING!  The extended edition only emphasizes this point.  I had a blast exploring the new bonus features (including an original abandoned opening titles sequence) and rediscovering the movie that changed my life. <br /> <br />Buy this DVD, be inspired, and get lost in the world of Gladiator!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm shocked that a series of this quality, with original story lines and a fantastic cast, got canceled after only one season.  Than again, as I'm not a Fox fan, I never knew it existed, else I would have watched it.  HOwever, having now learned how the network  mishandled (aired the episodes in the wrong order)the series, none of this should be a shock.  If you are a person who loves being independent and dreams of personal freedom to live your life, this series is for you and you will fall in love with these people.  Well worth the price!
B000000Y2F|5.0|During the summer of 1957, Thelonius Monk and John Coltrane played together at the Five Spot Cafe in New York City.  Up until a couple weeks ago, (when the Carnegie Hall concert was released), this was the only recording in existence with these two jazz gods.  Backing up Trane and Monk are Wilbur Ware (bass) and Shadow Wilson (drums).  Some reviewers complain about the sound quality, but I barely even notice it.  Those who complain about the sound quality are not listening to the music enough, because this is a truly epic release. <br /> <br />This album is a bit misleading as only three tracks were recorded at the Five Spot, 'Ruby My Dear,' 'Trinkle Tinkle,' and 'Nutty.'  On 'Ruby My Dear,' we hear the softer side of this quartet, with Trane's haunting tenor matching up quite well with Monk's melodic style of playing.  The two elements are absorbed and become one.  It sounds as if they've been playing together for years.  On 'Trinkle, Tinkle,' there is more of a constant switch-off between these two masters.  The highlight is Coltrane's first solo, which really swings and is full of what critics label his 'sheets of sound.'   <br /> <br />There are three additional tracks that were not recorded at the Five Spot: 'Functional,' which is an unaccompanied piano solo and 'Off Minor' and 'Epistrophy' which also feature Coleman Hawkins on tenor, Gigi Gryce on alto, Ray Copeland on trumpet, and the legendary Art Blakely filling in on drums.  My favorite of these three is the monk classic, 'Epistrophy' which really swings and is full of what I consider to be the best sax playing on the record.  The trumpet/sax harmonies are brilliant and Trane is in another universe. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an essential recording for your jazz collection, and I'd include it with KIND OF BLUE and GIANT STEPS as fantastic records to begin with for the entire genre.  After you pick this up and give it a whirl, make sure you pick up Coltrane and Monk at Carnegie Hall on Blue Note Records.

If you played Kiss Alive and then this one right after, your only response would be to laugh out loud. This doesn't even sound like a good cover band of Kiss. What Happened?????

B0002MB7QW|5.0|It start off with a scientist drilling in Alaska. Then we go to a press conference in England. The plot unfolds as storms start hitting the entire surface of Earth. We watch it as it turns colder and colder until it suddenly goes into a new ice age. <br /> <br />I love seeing New York city under water it was great special effects when the sea turn into a giant wave it got taller then the Statue of Liberty people start running which was so go about this movie cause it was like Hurrican Katrina distroyed New Orleans. <br /> <br />What didn't make since to me was a cop in this movie who saw a couple in a Taxi the couple were beating on the window for help but that cop kept on saying \\"I can't understand what your saying\\" cause they speak French it's obvious that they wanted to get out cause of the storm.
B00005JLEU|5.0|There's a guy in the beginning of the DVD who says, \\"You are so lucky to be seeing this movie.\\"  I laughed out loud when I heard him say that.  But you know what?  He's right.<br /><br />Young Chihiro wanders into an alternate world where her parents are turned into pigs and she must save them.  Does this sound ridiculous?  Yes, and in fact, the person I watched it with read the synopsis and said, Do I really want to see this?  He was very hesitant.  (And the cheesy guy at the beginning telling us how lucky we were added to the pressure...)  But it was fantastic.  The story is beautiful and moving, the animation incredible.<br /><br />I've since watched some other Miyazaki movies and not been quite so in love with them.  As far as I can tell, this is his masterpiece.<br /><br />I wouldn't show it to a young child though.  Even though it's animated, the story is quite complicated and the monsters can be pretty scary.  It's rated PG and with good reason.
0380018179|5.0|This book tells how to live life.  Hard work is a virtue but love is the thing that should come first.  The author was about 40 years old when she writing this novel but appears that she was so knowledgeable for so many fields such as farming, wars, other cultures, medicine and of course politics.  The paperback version that I purchased was a little too thick as it was almost 700 page long.  And the letters were a bit too small.
0452281881|5.0|This book is a scream.  It reminds me of that show \\"The Office\\" only a little more insane and dysfunctional.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|I never thought the original batman could have any compitition and I was right. This movie not only was as good as the original batman, it was better.

B00005JNTX|1.0|Despite the all-star cast, Quentin Tarintino's guest directing, and attempt to make the movie \\"artistic\\" and stylish, it was unbelievably horrible. <br /> <br />This is a movie with a plot (if that's what you want to call it) that was based AROUND the violence.  Basically, it's just that--a movie about violence.  Everyone's a killer and they all enjoy being killers.  Not five minutes go by (literally) without chopped off limbs flying, eyeballs popping, blood squirting, heads rolling...you get the picture. <br /> <br />I've never been one to shy away from a film that shows violence and gore, but when that's all there is to the movie it gets boring real fast.  The only good thing I can say about it is I liked the crime novel style of dialogue.  But really that's about it. <br />
B000006ZL4|5.0|Symphony X's masterpiece, Divine Wings of Tragedy, surpasses every other prog metal group I've heard. I don't even like the whole CD. In fact, a few songs I can't even stand to listen to. But several are absolutely incredible. The Accolade and the title song alone are entirely worth the cost of the CD. Those certainly aren't the only good songs on the CD though. In addition to the others, Of Sins and Shadows and Sea of Lies are both VERY well made. A few of the songs' lyrics seem a little forced to me. Almost like the lyricist is trying too hard. Aside from that, I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys music with a solid foundation of complex, well-written compositions.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|Did you ever get that feeling when watching documentaries or reality tv that people are playing for the camera and acting overdramatic?  I was actually expecting that from this documentary but I didn't sense that at all from the guys in Metallica.  It seemed very genuine and even brutally honest at times. <br /> <br />I never really liked Metallica except for 2 or 3 songs, and even then I didn't like them enough to buy a CD.  I'm one of those criminals who downloaded them from Napster.  So sue me.  But it was interesting to see the clash of egos between Ulrich and Hetfield, and how they were determined to work through their differences.  They even hired a band therapist to help.  It seemed to me that all the talk sessions actually made the situation worse.  It wasn't until they were asked to do a promotion for a radio contest which required them to read from a goofy script, that they finally came together as a band.  While cracking jokes and making each other laugh over the absurdity of the script, it seemed like they became Metallica...the rebels against the establishment which they obviously thrive on.  After that they seemed to get along much better. <br /> <br />There is one funny segment in which the band decides they don't need therapy anymore and agree to fire the therapist.  The problem is the therapist won't leave! <br /> <br />I was also pleasantly surprised that they addressed the whole Napster fiasco.  I didn't think they'd touch that one, but (especially Lars) spoke his true feelings about it and how it affected him.  They also addressed some issues about Jason Newsted (spelling?) and after attending a successful opening night with his new band, they openly confessed that they were envious of his success.  I think that took a lot of courage.  However, I was disappointed that they didn't discuss the abuse they put on the poor guy while he was with the band.  I would have liked to have known Jason's and Metallica's thoughts on that. <br /> <br />Also, Dave Mustaine makes a cringe-inducing appearance in a therapy session where he whines and blames the band for his problems.  It's like get over it, dude!  That was almost too painful to watch! <br /> <br />It's also worth noting, while watching this, the underlying problems that come with being under contract and a product of a corporation, even if it isn't so readily apparent in the film.  Having to muster and force creativity in order to produce an album that sells must be extremely stressful. <br /> <br />This is definitely worth watching (even if you're not a Metallica fan).  It was very satisfying to get a glimpse into all the good and bad that goes with being in a band and making an album.

B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I went and saw these people in concert last friday and let me tell you, they were the absolute best. Having never heard Franz Feridinand in my life I was a bit skeptical (especially when the two opening acts were terrible!) but this up and coming band is going to make it HUGE someday. <br /> <br />Take Me Out is very original no matter what anyone compares it to. It does things I haven't heard anywhere else in rock'n roll, such as slowing down when it should be speeding up. This is great single by itself. <br /> <br />The best song on this cd is probaly Michael which gives an entire new meaning to the word 'sexy'. It has great lyrics, a memorable tune, and a beautiful voice to top it all off. I would buy the whole cd just for this song. <br /> <br />Although I like their new cd a little bit more, you can't buy the new one without this one. This cd was their first hit and i should mention that the songs are just too good to only listen to the new one. Go buy it right now!!!
0316172324|5.0|I finally got around to reading a book that's been talked about a lot in blogging circles...  Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell.  I found it fascinating, and it certainly explains a lot of things that I've often wondered about...<br /><br />The main question here is what happens in those first couple of seconds when you observe something?  Without often knowing why, you make some snap judgements that can often be extremely accurate.  But when asked to explain why you felt that way, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint the correct reasons.  This process of decision-making is called \\"thin-slicing\\", and it's the stripping away of various inputs that don't end up affecting the outcome of your decision.  If faced with 100 items of information about a decision, it's often just a small handful of items that consistently predict success or failure.  The subconscious can often find those points and sift out the pattern without us being able to know why.  Experts in a field, due to their exposure to the subject, can thin-slice even more quickly.  They stand a better chance of being able to explain the \\"why\\" behind it, but even then it's somewhat iffy.  Once you're aware of the thin-slicing phenomenon, you can start to accept it as a valid way to aid in the decision-making process.<br /><br />It wasn't covered in the book, but an application of this is something I've always found irritating in sports broadcasts.  You have color commentators taking a play and dissecting the smallest movements in the players, explaining how each one made conscious decisions to shift the hips here or move the arm there.  In reality, there's little conscious decisions made at all.  The players are really thin-slicing the situation based on their past experiences, and making split-second reactions.  The more experience and practice, the better the thin-slicing.  All the extraneous action and information is stripped away, and the things that matter are handled instantaneously.  If this type of thinking was more well-known, color commentators could be out of a job...  :)<br /><br />Definitely worth reading and pondering.  You may not agree with Gladwell, but it will force you to think about things...ntaneously.  If this type of thinking was more well-known, color commentators could be out of a job...  :) <br /> <br />Definitely worth reading and pondering.

The film stars Jimmy Fallon as a bad cop and a terrible driver( as if he would be allowed in the police if your a bad driver as he), Fallon then teams up with Latifah to catch bank Robers. The film is funny from start to finish but is really stupid. You have to turn of your brain to like this movie. It has many stupid moments but it's a movie. Overall the movie is really funny and you wont be disapointed.
B000A88EV4|5.0|Mike Leigh generates the ideas for his films through intense reflections on an original idea that interests him.  Through his cerebral process and in corporation with the cast, he fleshes out the characters and the story around the conceptual idea, which brings both filmmaker and cast together into an enlightening experience.  Before shooting the film, both Leigh and the cast can identify themselves with the characters to the very essence of their being, which offers a deeper and more meaningful character.  Thus, Leigh centers most of his film on himself, as the idea originates within him. This is also the case with Naked.<br /><br />The title that Leigh applied to his 1993 cerebral mesh of cinematic cynicism does tangibly imply the notion of self-exposure.  Even though it might, and does, suggest a physical display of the human anatomy, the title, more accurately, provides an allusion towards the complete revelation of the character, Johnny (David Thewlis), in the film.  Naked offers an absolute exposure of Johnny's thoughts, values, and other accumulated information both assimilated and adapted throughout a lifetime.  Nothing is too sacred, or secret, in Leigh's film, which viciously displays Johnny's contempt for society as a whole.  The contemptuous mood of the film filters through Johnny's personal confessions with strangers and outsiders, which seemingly rests within the highly intelligent, but mutilated mind of Johnny.  In a sense, this confessional approach of telling the tale of Johnny, functions almost like a personal purging of Leigh's own implacable characteristics.<br /><br />A dark and secluded alley strikes the audience's retina in the initial scene.  The sporadic light in the alley exposes some of the bare red brick and a little of the dirty cement underneath.  The camera shakily and swiftly advances through the narrow alleyway accompanied by the intensifying sound of carnal lust.  A rapid succession of frames moves the audience closer to a man and a woman that, at first, seem to express their shameless desires for one another, when suddenly the man turns violent and grabs the woman's throat and wrist.  He continues his repeated hip thrusting motion while the woman begins to whimper and begs him to stop.  Abruptly, the man ceases his defilement of the woman, which gives the woman an opportunity to escape.  This man is Johnny.<br /><br />From the brief, yet disturbing opening, the audience quickly discovers the dark side of Johnny, as he truly becomes the antihero. Most viewers will deem Johnny after his actions, as a spineless beast without moral fiber that deserves the worst possible punishment.  This is a notion that Johnny seems to be highly aware of, as he consequently steals a car and escapes the possible repercussions of social shame and the possibility of severe punishment.  However, what trigged Johnny to commit this vile act nourishes the curiosity, as he does have a strong sense of what is right and wrong.<br /><br />The lengthy cinematic rationalization of Johnny begins when he seeks refuge in London, where an old girlfriend becomes his last opportunity for temporary sanctuary.  Antagonistically, Johnny thrusts his hostile and negatively skewed perspective of life on all that enter his existence such as the ex-girlfriend, Louis (Lesley Sharp), her roommate (Katrin Cartlidge), Brian the Nightwatchman (Peter Wight), a Scot with a severe tick problem (Ewen Bremner), and the sadistically misogynic Jeremy (Greg Cruttwell).  Everything from childhood trauma with his mother's sinful occupation to religious debates eventually leads into existentialism in regards to predetermined existence exposed by Nostradamus to the big bang theory.  Eloquent criticism oozes out of Johnny's spiteful mouth with intentional scornfulness that forms cerebral depositions in regards to the misery humanity faces.  All of these lengthy viewpoints should be revered and cherished, as Johnny emerges with a conviction similar to Achilles' faith in his own invulnerability.  It gets to the point where Johnny's ridicule of the society becomes intriguingly entertaining while his supreme ego crushes all verbal opposition with articulate and depressing gibberish.<br /><br />Within the strong conviction of his own intelligence an immediate weakness surfaces in Johnny, as he always sees the glass as half full.  One of his strongest and self-supporting comments, \\"...you might already have had the happiest moment in your whole life and all you got to look forward to is sickness and purgatory.\\"  In essence, Johnny's depressing cognitive skills seem to prevent himself from climbing out of the deepest of intellectual pits, as he always pushes himself down with his own negative perspectives while always assimilating newly acquired information to his already pessimistic life philosophy.  Johnny is that kind of person that brings darkness and sickness into the existence, which so many attempt to escape with self-help books and expensive shrinks.  However, Leigh seems to be painfully aware of this notion, as he exuberantly dives into this project to pull out something extremely dark within himself by exorcizing his own cerebral demons by fully exposing himself.<br /><br />Naked opens with a despicable scene, an event that most could never see themselves accomplishing.  Through this scene, Leigh captures self-hatred through Johnny's existence in darkness, shadows, and an environment from which people strive to escape.  Nonetheless, Johnny seeks out these depressive times and places both physically and cerebrally, which the script and mise-en-scene so powerfully displays.  David Thewlis' performance is straight-out spectacular, as he embodies physically, intellectually, and spiritually the archetype for gloominess.  It is a performance that went under the Oscars radar most likely due to its negative content, but nonetheless, Thewlis mesmerizes, antagonizes, and amuses any viewer in any continent.  Lastly, Naked provides a cinematic canvas upon which Leigh freely reveals the darker parts of personal self-reflection, which offers humanity a chance through understanding and deeper contemplation beyond the mere glumness of existence.to Achilles' faith in his own invulnerability.

B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay is not trying to break musical barriers. Instead, they seek to do great things within existing musical standards.  Hmmm...sounds like another english foursome I've been a fan of... <br /> <br />No joke, though.  Like the Beatles before Sgt. Pepper, Coldplay isn't trying to re-invent the wheel.  Instead, they're trying to perfect the wheel. <br /> <br />Listen closely...the beauty is in the details.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|If this film had been made in the early-70s, it would have been considered a masterpiece. Reminded me of The Rain People or something by Cassavetes while watching it. Unfortunately, modern American audiences just aren't equipped for a film like this. They don't have the patience, the emotional depth to absorb this kind of realism. Too bad. This is a beautiful film, simple and heartbreaking.

B000AA305M|1.0|I was going to buy this CD the other day in Best Buy but I thought I would listen to a few tracks and check out the reviews on Amazon first and I sure am glad I did. I have had a couple of close calls with buying CD's with copy protection which is to say that once I find out the artist has allowd their company to do this to their CD's I do not buy them. I have over 1000 CD's and do not mind supporting artists, but I refuse to pay for a product and then be told when, where, and how I can use it. This is essentually what companies like Sony is doing and since I can't change their policies I choose to boycott this practice. I also have an IPod and take it with me all over and if a CD won't allow me to put it on my computer hard drive and on my IPod then it is of no use to me. Now I can add this artist to my list of do not buys.

B0002OERI0|2.0|I doubt it. If you want a good Green Day album pick up Dookie, please. I almost want to cry when I hear \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", it just is terrible compared to old Green Day. Please, pick up Dookie, you will be pleased.
078681859X|3.0|This book was hard to get into because I didn't really connect with any of the characters.  Neither the boy or the djinni were especially likeable, which made me on the fence about who to cheer for throughout the book.  It seems the theme is not about good vs. evil, but lesser evil vs. greater evil.  Maybe I went into it hoping it would compare to Harry Potter, my mistake.  More than likely I will not read books 2 or 3 of this trilogy.  Sorry Bartimeus. :(
B000AL730O|5.0|CHAOS AND CREATION is the best Paul McCartney solo album ever made. It's the real deal, from start to finish. \\"English Tea\\" is as good as anything he's written, including with the Beatles. \\"Fine Line\\" sounds like a Billy Joel smash. \\"Follow Me,\\" \\"Friends to Go,\\" \\"Jenny Wren,\\" and \\"Too Much Rain\\" are of high quality. From beginning to end, CHAOS holds your attention tight. It's better than MEET THE BEATLES and maybe even WITH THE BEATLES. Paul's come through big time here, especially after the mediocrity of DRIVING RAIN. It might be the best solo Beatles album ever made.
B000AE8FZS|5.0|I finally got my copy after pre-ordering & re-ordering on 9-18-05.    It was well worth the wait. For me it's like having a new Gentle Giant album, because I wasn't famiiliar with it when it originally came out.  For some stupid reason, it was overlooked in the album pile & then sold or traded, although I had all the other albums since Three Friends.  I like cuts 4-7 the best, then 1 & 3 and then the reggae cut the least.  Some of it reminds me of the good parts of the Missing Piece.  Overall it's a very good overlooked album.  Now all I need is the first four albums & Civilian which is not asking alot.  Luckily, I found an out of print German import copy of Octopus, which sounds very good.  Thanks again for the remasters.
B000002JR8|5.0|One reviewer in a rock magazine a few years back reported that seeing Pantera live was so intense it was almost frightening, such was the power and energy.  If a band was ever successful at transferring that ferocity to tape in the studio, nobody came closer than Pantera on their third CD \\"Far Beyond Driven.\\"<br /><br />  This CD is the sound of war.  It's the sound of absolute chaos, brutality and earthquakes.  Defining this slab as metal only scratches the surface.<br /><br />  Guitar hero (RIP) Dimebag Darrell puts on layers upon layers of the densest, loudest guitars ever captured.  Your eardrums scream out against the assault.  Phil Anselmo adds his mostly indecipherable gutteral roar over the storm as each track seemingly gets angrier and angrier.  Only when \\"Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\\" begins does anything resembling melody give us a reprieve, only to have that briefest break drowned out with \\"25 Years\\", \\"Shedding Skin\\" and the most psychotic whammy dive ever at the end of \\"Throes of Rejection.\\"  Then, just to show they can play and sing, a faithful cover of Black Sabbath's \\"Planet Caravan\\" closes the set.<br /><br />  This is not an easy CD to listen to.  It wasn't meant to be.  \\"Vulgar Display Of Power\\" has more hooks, as does \\"The Great Southern Trendkill\\".  However, when your nerves have had the last bit of patience stomped out of them and you want to play something loud that clearly tells people to get the hell away, this is it.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|Listening to live cuts from this CD right now on local radio station's Sunday morning Blues show.  Going to advance order so I will get it ASAP.  Teaming up with others just makes him shine even brighter. <br />
B00005V0X5|5.0|This band is truely amazing. This album is truely amazing. K.I.M.B.A.B.I.G IS the king of thrash metal. This is raw brutal stuff, having less than half decent recording production, and the intelectual jazz musicians Gar Samuelson and  Chris Poland, this classic record is truely unique. Mustaines has complicated blindingly fast doubled pick riffs and actually interesting lyrical style, this is a must have for any fan of metallica, slayer, exodus, anthrax, or any other metal band! Way better than mattalica, more interesting than slayer (though not as brutal). If you are searching for megadeth on amazon (making you slightly interested in this band), then BUY THIS ALBUM.
B00005QXXO|5.0|'I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings' is a must for the Radiohead fan. Intensly opening with \\"The National Anthem\\", you can hear a new feeling of intensity for the song, both instrumentally and vocaly, moving the song along at paces and strengths not heard in the studio version. \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" beautifully incorporates the piano and Thom Yorke's voice creating an atmospheric and emotionally driven work that, in my opinon, is the best i've ever heard for this song. \\"Everything in it's Right Place\\" takes off unlike the studio version allowing you to hear just how amazing they are with their live performances, and the ride lasts for almost 8 minutes! One of the catchier songs is \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" due to the truer rock sound the song presents, while \\"True Love Waits\\" is a great acoustic performance showing the softer side of the band. All in all, I have to say I love Radiohead's albums, but hearing them live brings a newer and greater appreciation. Guaranteed this will greatly please the Radiohead fan or any music enthusiast for that matter. Buy this and enjoy!!!
B0000029GA|5.0|\\"Illmatic\\":probably,one of the best rap cds.For the lirycs,because Nasir Jones write of streets,of world,of times,of past and future...For the beats,because thwe album is produced by great people like DJ Premier,Pete Rock,Large Professor and others;for the featurings...becuase the cd contains only one collabo,but really intersting:Nas' homie AZ raps in \\"Life's A Bit**\\",beautiful track where the rapper shows his fast flow and his rhymes collection.Ahhh...if I must review \\"Illmatic\\",I must tell about tracks.Do you like jazz-rap?Well,Preemo produce two important tracks,\\"Memory Lane\\"(with an autumnal atmophere)and \\"NY State Of Mind\\";if you love Old School,you can't miss \\"The World Is Yours\\" that contains an interpolation from \\"It's Yourz\\" of T-La Rock (the song is poduced by Pete Rock)...Nas' first album is probably one of the five better hip-hop cds.And there are just ten tracks.With these ten tracks,Nas have showed that is not important the tracklist lenght...not quantity,QUALITY.-and he showed his skillz-.  <br /> <br /> <br />EXCUSE ME BUT I HAVE MISS MY PASS SO I'M REWRITING EVERY REVIEW ;)
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael is such a treat to listen to. I love the lush big band songs he covers and his new little gem called \\"Home\\" which I thoroughly enjoy.

0399152717|1.0|One of the rules of fantasy writing is to encourage the reader to suspend disbelief and enter the world of the story. <br /> <br />Mr. Cussler did this quite well in past novels, especially Raise the Titanic and Sahara.  In Polar Shift, he never even opens a door--or porthole, in this case--for a reader to do so. <br /> <br />The fact that Kurt Austin is no Dirk Pitt is part of the problem.  After all, why create characters who are vague images of much-better realized ones...distorted shapes in a flawed mirror of the writer's imagination?  Do we need Kurt and Joe when the originals work much better...And about whom we care, when they become involved in their adventures? <br /> <br />A deeper problems lies with the threat posed by the \\"mad\\" villain.  While polar shifts will be a real threat to the world security in perhaps 100,000 years, they are no threats today.  We have much more serious nightmares, including nuclear anihilation warfare or eco-disasters through global warming. <br /> <br />Without a believable and credible threat, Polar Shift never allows for the suspension of disbelief for the reader.  It just wanders on and on, with mundane scenes and dialogue, an unnecessary sub-plot involving an extraordinary scientific discovery, and no real physical or pyschological threats for our heroes. <br /> <br />Mr. Cussler should dump his writer and go back to what he does best:  Create more deeds of derring-do for Dirk and Al. <br /> <br />

0740748475|5.0|Many people here are probably familiar with Calvin and Hobbes, with the often manic Calvin and his comrade in adventure/escapades, Hobbes. Many have probably already bought various compilations of the comic strips and looked through them again and again. So why buy THIS collection?<br /><br />  Mainly because it goes WAY beyond anything else that is already out there - and not just because it contains EVERY single one of the comic strips in one collection, nicely slipcased. Buy it  because it comes closest to reflecting what Bill Watterson, creator of these comics, wanted, exceptional color quality, pretty much up to his very perfectionistic standards. Buy it because for the first time you'll see the comic in as close to perfect form as you'll find...and yes, buy it because you'll finally have all of the strips in one set.<br /><br />  How much of a perfectionist was Watterson when it came to having control over his beloved characters? Well, imagine turning down a call from Steven Spielberg because you just aren't interested in collaborating with anyone, genius or not, on a work based on your comic strip. Imagine giving up lucrative contracts for lunch boxes, animated films, stuffed Calvin and Hobbes figures.<br /><br />  Whether you think that turning down all those potentially lucrative opportunities was admirable or crazy, there is no denying that he poured his heart, soul and psyche into his work, not distracted by meetings about the design of a lunch box or the  decal that woould appear on clothing.<br /><br />  Nope, he just did his work, day in and day out, until he decided, at an early age (around 37) that he'd done enough and simply....stopped. That was a sad day for me,as I'd grown to love Calvin and Hobbes and their unique world, one in which you never really knew the names of Calvin's parents (anyone know?), one in which his teacher could morph into a monster, one that exemplified the psyche of one little boy so well and which hasn't been equaled since.
B000AA7AW6|4.0|Marching Bands of Manhatten - 5/5 - I love this song, the way the song builds up is fantastic. <br />Soul Meets Body - 3/5 - It's the first single off the album,  the radio edit isnt as good as the full length LP version. <br />Summer Skin - 4/5 - Upbeat song with great lyrics. <br />Different Names for the Same Thing - 4/5 - A soft song <br />I Will Follow You Into the Dark - 5/5 - This is probably Gibbards greatest work here, \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\" is a true song about romance.  If you don't like Death Cab I would still recommend buying this CD for this song. <br />Your Heart Is a Empty Room - 3/5 - Yeah.... <br />Someday You Will Be Loved - 4/5 - \\"Youll be loved like you never have known\\" <br />Crooked Teeth - 5/5 - Another upbeat song that builds up, Gibbard also did a good job with lyrics on this song. <br />What Sarah Said - 4/5 - Piano. <br />Brothers On a Hotel Bed - 5/5 Reminds me of the Postal Service with Synth in it. <br />Stable Song - 3/5 - Same as Stability just sped up. <br />Jealousy Rides With Me - 4/5 - A folk song, Prety good. <br /> <br />I'm not sure if this album is worth forty dollars for Jealousy Rides with Me.  But if your a big fan your going to want the song.
B000024JPW|4.0|Karajan made a specialty of this great and difficult work, which he recorded no less than five times. I don't believe in duplicating reviews here at Amazon, but I am posting this one under each performance--they range from a live radio broadcast in 1959 from the Salzburg Festival to a digital recording from 1985 in Berlin. In general the sound improves as time goes on, and except for the last recording, the soloists are uniformaly world class.<br /><br />Since Karajan's readings rank among the best ever made, I'd like to give a brief rundown of each:<br /><br />1959 Salzburg (EMI): In many ways this is the dream recording. The orchestra is the Vienna Phil, the chorus the Singverein of Vienna, Karajan's favorite--they appear in all his recordings.  The solo quartet captures Leontyne Price in her prime--her glorious voice is incomparable in this  part. Christa Ludwig, Nicolai Gedda, and Nicola Zaccaria join Price in a passionate, involved performance that brings more excitement and commitment than any other. The only real downside is the tubby mono sound--you are aware of listening to a gigantic work through your home radio. If you can adjust your ears and listen through the sound, as it were, this was obviously a very great event.<br /><br />1960 Philharmonia (Testament): This EMI commercial recording came out originally in  mono, ltter in muffled stereo. It's been cleaned up by Testament for reissue, but the chorus is sitll fairly murky and distant. Otherwise, this is a very satisfying performance, the second best of the five in my opinion. The solo quartet is marked by actually singing and not shouting, and they blend beautifully, which only makes sense because Schwarzkopf, Ludwig, and Gedda had sung togehter for years on EMI. They would go on to sing a superlative Verdi Requiem under Giulini.  The bass again is Nicola Zaccaria, another old hand at EMI but not of the same caliber of the other three singers. Karajan's conducting lacks the fiery intensity of the live Salzburg performance from the year before, but everything is relative. This is still a strong, committed reading in every way.<br /><br />1966 Berlin (DG): From here to the end all the recordings are with the Berlin Phil. This recording came out nose to nose with the famed Klemperer set from London (EMI), and on the whole Klemperer is superior, thanks to somewhat clearer sound and an unsurpassed chorus trained by Wilhelm Pitz. Karajan's quartet is once again stellar: Gundula Janowitz, Christa Ludwig, Fritz Wunderlich, and Walter Berry. Wunderlich was the greatest lyric tenor in Germany and sounds wonderful here. I don't generally care for Janowitz'a piping, hooty soprano, which sounds more like a woodwind instrument than a fully expressive voice, but I concede that I am in the minoriyt. The sonics are a bit glaring, and they get ocngested in the massed passages with chorus and orchestra. DG may have improved the sound in the 1996 reissue on a bargain two-fer; I hven't heard it, although there's no doubt this recording is at times uncomfortably shrill.<br /><br />1975 Berlin (EMI): Karajan keeps proceeding with at least one new Missa Solemnis per decade. This particular recording features another stellar quartet, with Janowitz held over from the DG set and sounding excactly the same. She is joined by Peter Schreier, Agnes Baltsa, and Jose Van Dam. All except Schreier were Karajan favorites in the Seventies. They sing very well, even though one hears a noticeable drop in command and luster from the earlier quartets. The recorded sound, unfortunately, is just as congested in tuttis as on the DG set. In general this performance shows no advances on earlier readings and in my opinion is the most negligible of the five.<br /><br />1985 Berlin (DG):  For the first time one notices a leap forward in sound quality, thanks to digital multi-miking. From the outset there's more orchestral detail, cleaner separation of voices, and good highlighting of the vocal quartet. The engineers weren't stuck with a single microphone placement, which could never capture chorus, orchestra, and soloists satisfactorily. Unfortunately, when the big tuttis arrive in the Gloria, the chorus and orchestra become just as congested as before. This is due to Karajan's insistence on using a very large chorus; their massed sound muddies when the music gets very loud.  Over the years he didn't drastically change his approach to the Missa Solemnis, and since this 1985 recording has the best sound, one wishes it could be recommended as the best overall document. It's badly let down, however, by the quartet, consisting of two unknown women--Lella Cuberli and Trudeliese Schmidt--who aren't exactly great discoveries, along with the light-voiced tenor Vinson Cole and a dry, aging Jose Van Dam.<br /><br />With enough time and space, one could detail hundrds of small musical differences between these performances. In 1985, for example, the Gloria shoots out at rocket speed compared with the other four performances. But this way madness lies.  For me it's enough to know that all but the 1985 are great interpretations, the sound is about even between 1966 and 1975, with 1960 in serviceable stereo. And the best overall? The live 1959 Salzburg must be counted one of those events that no one will ever forget who was fortunate enough to be present.ineers weren't stuck with a single microphone placement, which could never capture chorus, orchestra, and soloists satisfactorily.

B00009V7P8|5.0|I Loved this CD!  It is haunting and beautifully melancholy.  It became an addiction!
B0001ZMBV0|4.0|The reviewer who says that these are among the most celebrated of classical recordings is exaggerating. Giulini's Chicago recordings for EMI were mostly commercial failures and quickly vanished from sight after a brief life on LP. After a spectacular early stretch with Don Giovanni, the Marriage of Figaro, and the Verdi Requiem, Giulini should have shot to the top tier of recording artists.<br /><br />But as one hears on this excellent but not great collection, Giulini's Mahler is not as exciting as Bernstein's, his Berlioz  not as gripping as Colin Davis's, his Brahms not as full of integrity as Klemperer's or Karajan's. He stood well below those great condcutors for much of his career, and yet Giulini was undoubtedly special.  He just continued throughout his career to be spotty. His Bruckner Seventh on a live BBC recording is spectacular, even better than his inward, mystical recordings of the Burckner Eighth and Ninth for DG. I greatly admire his DG Schumann Rhenish Sym., his Erocia and Beethoven Fifth, and a live War Requiem and Schubert Ninth, both on BBC--while also acknowledging that he made many other recordings that didn't  touch greatness.<br /><br />I think Giulini had greatness in him, but there was some inner chemistry that had to fire, and even he didn't know when that would happen. In this regard he was like Klaus Tennstedt, who was even more erratic.<br /><br />Giulini should have given us a great Mahelr Ninth and Das Lied von der Erde, but he didn't. HIs Missa Solemnis and Beethoven Ninth should have been towering spiritual achievements, but they are actually almost routine by great conductor standards. Sadly, he had no sublime autumn to his career; the late recordings on Sony and DG are distressingly slack and ponderous, often parodying his famous spirituality on the podium.<br /><br />I think eveyrthing in this bargain set is of a high standard, not Giulini at his very peak but close.
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|i'm french and it was the only way to see the second season of the O.C which was great! I prefered the season one but this one is good too!! ican't wait to see the third season! <br />Bonus are good too so i like these dvds so much!!
B00005JO0J|4.0|Firefly, the series, is one of my all time favorite Sci-Fi / Future/Tech Fantasy TV shows.  I love the Wild West and Oriental cultural overtones ... I love the rough and tumble nature of the crew and their missions and lifestyle.  And I particularly loved the time and attention that was given to exploring and expressing the very different personalities of the crew members as their individual and collective stories were being unfolded. I just loved that series.  I watch the DVDs over and over.<br /><br />So, I was really very interested in what they were going to do with the Serenity movie.  Here's my take, now that I've seen it:<br /><br />A)  Were they true to the characters, themes and styles of the TV show?  YES, absolutely, though with a few twists.<br /><br />B)  Did they explore and expand on the themes and plot lines laid down in the series without doing so in a way that requires having seen the TV series to enjoy the movie?  YES.  Absolutely.<br /><br />C)  Was the mixture of action, suspense and quality gritty story telling up to the standard of the TV show.  Yes, absolutely.<br /><br />D)  Was the movie just like the series?  No.<br /><br />A series can take the time, week to week, to slowly and carefully unfold layers of it's characters and story lines that a movie simply can't.  The series brief 11 episodes had something like 450 minutes with which to carefully, slowly, gradually unfold these characters and story lines ... the movie had 119.  So I didn't expect the movie to have THE SAME feel as the show.  What I was hoping for was a look and feel that was consistent with the show while recognizing that a theatrical movie release has to have somewhat different goals from a TV series.  I think they did a great job of that.  And I really enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />I've seen some folks say that the movie lacked some of the personal intimacy of the TV show, and I think that's true.  Given the fact that it was a 2 hour movie and they had 9 characters to deal with in a balanced way, maintaining the same degree of intimacy while still presenting a movie that was compelling to the action/adventure crowd would have been amazingly difficult, if it's possible at all.  As someone who really loved that very personal feel the series had, I didn't think they gave up more of that in the movie than was absolutely necessary.  And if the gangbuster movie results win them a chance to give new birth to the TV show ... well, then they will have succeeded in achieving what I think was their and their fans dream of dreams.<br /><br />Were there any things I'd have done differently?  Yeah, but so what.  This show had a lot of very emotionally attached fans.  They can't do everything the way every fan would have preferred.  Did they do a great job that I felt totally able to enjoy?  Yes, you bet.  And the friend who went with me to the movie had only seen 2 of the 11 series episodes and he also enjoyed it ... and he's a pretty demanding Sci-Fi fan.l with in a balanced way, maintaining the same degree of intimacy while still presenting a movie that was compelling to the action/adventure crowd would have been amazingly difficult, if it's possible at all.

0156027321|5.0|It says fiction.  It is supposedly not a true story.  Yet, it is written so believably that you get sucked into it, even though the concept seems outlandish.  \\"The author had to have experienced this,\\" you say to yourself.  \\"Yes, okay, no one would have been in such a situation and certainly no one would last long, but...\\"  You just cannot write fiction like this without having really been there, right?  I'm still not convinced this is fiction, but it's got to be!  Right?  Oh, and you'll love the end.  I won't give it away, but I will say that this author can really write!  I'm impressed!
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Those expecting exact replications of thirty-plus-year-old performances with sixties-period instruments and amplification will be disappointed. If, however, you can appreciate three of the most talented and artistically significant musicians in recent history performing that same material with astonishing levels of cohesion, lyricism, and polish, you will be as thoroughly delighted as I am with the triumphant return of Cream and the uniquely satisfying, musical magic that these recordings provide. The DVDs are artfully crafted with qualities of photography and design that are consistent with the music and contain additional tracks that are, irritatingly, omitted from the CDs. The interviews included on the DVDs are very insightful and, when compared to those from their farewell concert, demonstrate just how much these individuals have matured, as artists, men, and now, friends. Many thanks and congratulations to Eric Patrick Clapton for instigating the return of pure music, and to Peter Edward Baker and John Simon Asher Bruce for rejoining him in this wonderful, long-hoped-for adventure.  Can we hope to see a return to the studio? If so, my decades-old dream will be fully realized.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain has so many songs I love that I'm waiting for a Greatest Hits II album!  This one doesn't disappoint in picking some of her best.  I love pop and country both, so I don't have the same problem with this album as some reviewers here.  Shania is a talented woman!
1573223026|5.0|This is about four different people who meet on New Years Eve at a locally famous rooftop suicide spot. How they get to know and support each other after their collective failure to jump off. How they try to get used and deal with the idea of each of them living on. It's all told in the first person with each of them taking turns to move the story on. There isn't that much of a story, the entertainment comes from Hornby using his characters as vehicles for bringing his views on things to you the reader. These views can be funny or insightful or both and because of the nature of the novel being suicide and depression and lack of hope- I found the book so intense that sometimes I HAD to put it down almost to allow myself to ingest the emotions before continuing the next day. Hornby has a terrific voice, knowledgeable and funny and he struggled now and then to keep HIS voice out of all the characters. There's no wasted pages, no filler material at all though the book does lose it's impetus a little as you get through it- I'm not sure if this was me getting used to the subject matter or if Hornby loses his way a bit. Luckily though, it was just good enough in the end to merit the five stars. Original, well written and an easy but intense read.
B000A3EJB8|4.0|This is a well acted, quirky period piece with an unusual story line. Here, an English gentleman (Stephen Dillane) is looking for a weekend of fairly anonymous sex in hopes of fathering a child, as his invalid wife is not up to the task. An impoverished Swiss miss (Sophie Marceau) is desperate for money due to her family's circumstances. She passes muster during the initial interview with the English gentleman and is hired for the job of potential surrogate mother. Their nights of anonymous sex turn out to be a surprise for both of them, yet they part with the understanding that they will never again meet. Their union having proved fruitful, she ultimately gives birth to a child, their daughter, who is taken from her immediately after birth and given to the father, as contracted. For seven long years they are separated. They are then all brought together, causing upheaval and tumultuous changes in all their lives.<br /><br />This is a well acted drama with fine performances by the entire cast. The only wrong note is struck by the child who plays the seven year old daughter. She is simply odious and obnoxious, making the viewer itch to slap her. There is nothing that the child does that makes the viewer feel the child's desire for a mother. The other performers, however, more than make up for this one dimensional child actress. Moreover, the cinematography is quite beautiful, with stunning shots of a fairytale lake house. All in all, this is a film that those who love period pieces will enjoy.
B000AL730O|1.0|I was and am a huge Beatle fan. I've bought all of Sir Paul's albums, but this latest offering is nothing but forgetable tunes and uninspired lyrics.  His demise as the worlds greatest song writer is sad, but obvious.  This ain't no \\"Band On The Run\\"...notice how many used ones are already for sale.
B000BD730G|5.0|This is a terrific, old fashioned, madcap, screwball comedy. Deftly directed by Howard Hawkes, the pace is frenetic from the get-go and never lets up. Starring Cary Grant, as a straight-laced paleontologist, and Katherine Hepburn, as an impulsive and beautiful heiress, this film is simply about as good as comedy gets.<br /><br />The plot itself is simple. David Huxley (Cary Grant), a noted paleontologist, is trying to get a philanthropical grant of money for his museum from a wealthy donor. In his quest for this charitable gift, he runs into Susan (Katherine Hepburn), who, unbeknownst to him, is the niece and prospective heiress to his potential philanthropist's fortune. Once David meets up with this madcap heiress, his life will never be the same.<br /><br />The film is noted for its highly improbable situations, its rat-a-tat-tat, stacatto delivery of lines, its frenetic pacing, and impeccable comedic timing. Toss in a missing dinosaur bone, a little dog with a fondness for such, a domesticated leopard (if there is such a thing), a not so tame leopard, a great cast and script, and voila, one ends up with a great film!<br /><br />Cary Grant is marvelous as David Huxley, the straight-laced, befuddled man of science who is drawn into improbable situations by Susan. Katherine Hepburn is sensational as Susan, the airhead heiress whose hair-brained ideas just lead to trouble. Of course, Susan falls for David, and the games begin. In addition to Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, the film has notable performances by Charles Ruggles, as big game hunter Major Applegate, Barry Fitzgerald as the hapless hired hand, Mr. Gogarty, and Walter Catlett, as Slocum, the criminally stupid town constable.<br /><br />It is with good reason that this film made The Entertainment Weekly list of the 100 best comedies ever made. It is an assessment with which I heartily concur. This is a superlative, vintage film that is well worth having in one's personal collection. Bravo!
B000002HMH|4.0|Definitely not Metallica's finest hour, but I found this album to have a nice alternative sound. Who F***in' cares if they had short hair, pimp suits, and goth makeup back in '96? Not me. I like alternative rock too, you know, and I found this one to be particularly underrated.     Ain't My B**** - 4 stars  2x4 - 3 stars  The House That Jack Built - 4.5 stars  Until It Sleeps - 4 stars  King Nothing - 5 stars  Hero Of The Day - 5 stars  Bleeding Me - 4 stars  Cure - 3 stars  Poor Twisted Me - 2 stars  Wasting My Hate - 4 stars  Mama Said - 3.5 stars  Thorn Within - 4 stars  Ronnie - 4 stars  The Outlaw Torn - 5 stars    I don't know if I'd recommend this to the casual fans that LOVE metal and nothing else, but if you like Metallica and alternative rock, then give this one a shot.

B000002HRE|2.0|I still remember that, after the release of this album, I had the sneaking suspiscion that Metallica had run out of steam (thank God Garage Inc. and S&M delayed those thoughts). I liked \\"Fuel\\", \\"The Unforgiven II\\", and \\"Fixxxer\\", but the rest are throwaways in my eyes. I mean, what the hell was up with the retarted moaning at the end of \\"The Memory Remains\\"? It would've been a halfway-decent song without it; the S&M version definitely kills the one here. <br /> <br />I can't really recommend this to anyone besides the diehard fans.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Anyone who likes the Joss Whedon Television shows: Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel, will enjoy this sci-fi western drama. But it attracts more than just fans of Joss with shoot-em-up/blow-em-up action, rapier wit, lust & love, awesome fight choreography and a truly compelling plot. The characters are relatable while still being admirable and one instantly finds themselves attached to them and interested in their affairs. If you watch the first episode and are not compelled to immediately watch the second I would be very surprised. Worth every one of the five stars.

068987474X|2.0|The premise of this book is that women should always monitor a man's actions to determine whether he is into her or not. Most likely, he is not. Why is it the woman's responsibility to figure out what his sweet nothings coupled with his absent-minded behavior translate into?  I've got a great idea - maybe men should be the ones to read a NY Times Best Seller on how not to say things they don't mean. I'll get you started on a few chapters:<br /><br />1. You were born with a pair of balls, use them!<br />2. If you're not attracted to her, don't ask for her number<br />3. If you like a girl, let her know.<br />4. If you don't like a girl, let her know.<br />5. If you want to marry her, let her know.<br />6. If you don't want to marry her, move out immediately to avoid common law penalties<br />7.

If you abuse drugs, you are an even bigger loser<br /><br />If you need to buy a book to make yourself feel sexy and wanted, you're better off putting that $14.05 towards a new haircut than this cheesy little book.
0385507755|1.0|Mr. Frey writes a typical and trite addiction/recovery book.  Unfortunately his immature view of his own strength and Chinese philosophy may lead some troubled person to try what has worked (so far) for Mr. Frey instead of the methodologies that actually help with addiction recovery. Mr. Frey will probably write some excellent books when he acquires more wisdom and maturity.  This book may appeal to Oprah's audience but it does not strike me as an important work.

B000063DI8|5.0|I have been a Maiden fan for a long time(since i listened to Powerslave and got hooked.) Everyone who has reviewed this album are not true iron maiden fans. All the puny two and three stars that you guys gave this cd are screwed up. I had this albunm burned for me a couple of weeks ago and I was hooked as soon as I put on the headphones. From Tailgunner to Mother Russia (a should have been greatest hit) all 10 songs are sweet. Killer solos, catchy verses and chorus', and pounding drums, this cd kicks huge butt. Here is a review on this cd from number 1 to number 10:<br /><br />Tailgunner: This song is really sweet! The killer intro goes for a 1:20 or so and the rest is maiden all the way. Its got interesting lyrics, driving riffs, and pounding drums. While not the best song on the cd, tailgunner is a great opener to NPFTD. 9 out of 10 stars.<br /><br />Holy Smoke: This greatest hit is definetly deserved! the verses, chorus', and everything about this song is insane! The driving riffs are catchy, the lyrics are Bruce at his best, and the solos are Maiden All The Way! A 10/10!<br /><br />No Prayer for The Dying: When the screwed up reviews were naming th \\"ok\\" songs on NPFTD they forgot to mention this one! This title track is my favorite song on the whole cd! Its slow, its meaningful, its got sweet solos, its got great lyrics, the drums aren't \\"Phil Rudd\\" funky primers, and i cant beleive its not a greatest hit! 11/10<br /><br />Public Enema Number One: Its a good song, but not a great one! I think this song is pretty good, but lets just say its not the first song i go to when I pop in the cd. I listened to it once: Ok, moving on. Then I listened to it again: When is this song over again? I think you get the picture! 6.5-7/10.<br /><br />Fates Warning: This is a pretty cool maiden song, but its hard to hear the vocals on a lot of the parts. It was definetly a releif from Public Enema, but its not like th title track. Its got strange but cool lyrics and great guitar riffs. 8.5/10<br /><br />Assassin: I love this song! Its my top three on the album and I think it should have been a hit. I love the solos and the lyrics are sneaky Bruces style completely. You better Watch Out, cause this song will grab you by the ears and pull you in! 10/10<br /><br />Run Silent Run Deep: Another great song that has an incredible intro! Even after I listened to the song, I replayed just to hear the intro again. The lyrics are meanfulful, though this is not a slow song, and the guitars are awesome! The drums are good and its one of my top five on the cd! 9/10<br /><br />Hooks in You: This song starts off good, but theres something about the chorus that just doesnt \\"hook me in.\\" I like it, but then i dont. It could have been a lot better if Bruce would have come a little stronger with the vocals. Still it has a sweet solo and good guitar riffs. 7.5/10.<br /><br />Bring Your Daughter...To The Slaughter: This song is a greatest hit but i dont think its better than NPFTD or Mother Russia which were not hits! Dont get me wrong, the riffs, drumming, and Bruces vocals are sweet and Iron maiden at their finest, but like i said, a little over-rated. Still a classic, and a perfect song for a horror movie. 9/10<br /><br />Mother Russia: I love the intro, the drums, the insane solos, the short but strong lyrics, and the humming. This song ends No prayer for the dying very strong. You will love it and will want to learn the words quickly. 10/10 all the way!<br /><br />Hoped you like my review.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|In keeping with the great cinematic movements of the past several decades, Team America World Police has quietly entered the realm of genius. The moving and innovative plot helps propell this film in to it's well deserved place in history.  Scenes like two puppets deficating on one another and that fat pompus piece of feces Micheal Moore blowing himself up reminicent of a spineless suicide bomber take their place along side the most memorable movie moments such as Scarlett saying the immortal words \\"Tommorrow is another day.\\"  And Humphrey Bogart walking off into the dark mist with Claude Rheins and uttering the famous \\"This looks like the start of a beautiful friendship.\\"  It is hard to think of a person left unchanged emotionally by Team America's subtle message and grace.  This fine piece of ciniema will live in mind souls of American's and possibly in the consciences of the world community at large for a long, long time if not forever.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This film is...different. I mean well, its Tim Burton different. But Johnny Depp does a great job at this Willy Wonka. People say Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka was better, and some say Johnny Depp's is. But the truth is they are both equal. The original movie was great and so was the new one, they are just different movies and they have different charecters to tell the truth. Johnny Depp does a creepier but funnier kind of version, and Gene Wilder played him as more of a man with no background. But that is one great thing about the movie. It actually shows Willy Wonka's background, so you see him as more human, and thats a good thing. This movie is gonna go down as a classic film just like the original.
B00000J6AG|4.0|I have to admit, I did not want to like Moby at first.  Some girl begged me to pop it into my cd player one day when this album was still kinda fresh.  I heard Moby was dorky, but I actually liked some songs from here like Porcelain, Machete, GuitarFluteString, and the last one.  I thought a couple songs from Everything is Wrong were decent too.  Now I heard a live rave album that I downloaded by Moby from Audio Galaxy from a few years back... NOW THAT WAS GOOD.  Moby should stick to that type of stuff because otherwise his stuff all sounds the same.
B00080ZG10|4.0|This portrayal of Howard Hughes as a rich, paranoid fruitcake obsessed with his belief that he was correct (perfect?) in everything he did was very difficult to watch.  His accent was grating, and the people around him, particularly the women and the politicians, were almost as bad. <br /> <br />But I remember Howard Hughes.  I can't really comment on his speech because he never (or rarely) spoke in public.  I can say that from the newspaper reports of him, particularly in the years before his death, he was indeed weird.  His paranoia got the better of him, and whatever admiration anyone may have had for him before (and I never did) was surely wiped out by his strange behavior as he got older, even stranger than in this film. <br /> <br />So, in reviewing this film, I find that it is a good beginning of the story of a very strange man, as I remember his public persona, but it was so hard to sit through that I don't know whether that means it was a good film or not.  I imagine the producer of the film put his point across, but as for it being an enjoyable film, no it was not.  It was a portrayal of paranoia gone mad!
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Sometimes it mystifies me why a group of people will all go out and get ID's so that they can write exactly one negative review of a film.  Constantine seems to have managed to outrage both the Hellblazer comic book crowd and the and the 'this is blasphemous' club.  After all, Constantine is intended as light entertainment, not scripture or imitation.  So let's just take a look at the film in and of itself for a moment. After all, if a film arouses this much antipathy there must be something to it.<br /><br />In John Constantine's (Keanu Reeves) world evil and good are locked in the age old struggle, but there are rules that the two sides play by.  The big rule is that true demons and angels cannot cross over to this plane, although there are plenty of what Constantine refers to as 'half-breeds' to make up the difference.  Constantine is something of an enforcer.  If demons get to out of line, his job is to whomp on them and send them back to hell.  How did he get the job?  It seems that when psychics commit suicide they run the risk of being both damned and restored to a job with no opportunities for advancement.  To make matters worse, John is dying for the second time - from lung cancer.<br /><br />Something is wronger than usual - trash scavengers have uncovered the spear of Longinus, there is unrest among the minions, and a woman commits suicide who never should have.  The woman's sister, Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) is a detective determined to understand how the tragedy could happen.  Before long Dodson and Constantine are working together and they find themselves faced with not just a few souls out of place, but a rebellion in hell that threatens to drop all humanity into the end of days.<br /><br />Reeves creates a Constantine who is more taciturn than the Hellblazer character, but whose grit and brusqueness still make him an interesting figure.  Weisz has more script and she fulfills her part as a foil for Constanine beautifully, This is a film which is decidedly un-sexy, regardless of the attractiveness of the leads.  The bit characters - half-angel Gabriel (played by Tilda Swinton who captures the angel's ambiguous sexuality perfectly), half-demon Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale), Midnote (Djimon Hounsou), and Beeman (Max Baker) - all have a crisp, comic book reality.  And Peter Stormare does an outstanding job as Satan twisted in a whole new fashion.<br /><br />Director Francis Lawrence does a notable job of capturing the feel of comic book illustration and framing within the parameters of film.  The film is carefully balanced between comic book sarcasm, humor, and the horrible seriousness of the underlying theme.  Putting everyone's 'issues' aside (and everyone seems to have one issue or another about Constantine) this is lightweight but well constructed piece of filmic fiction.ess of the attractiveness of the leads.

B00005JO0J|5.0|I'd seen the Firefly television series that this is based on, I'd seen the Serenity movie trailer, I'd read the Serenity official movie magazine and I'd also read the screenplay which is found in the Serenity Visual Companion, so suffice it to say I was prepped and ready to watch.<br /><br />Despite Serenity being released 3 years after Firefly, it is set a mere few months after the television series. In this movie we continue the adventures of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his on-board crew. Returning are all the leads from the series including first officer Zoe, her husband the pilot Wash, always looking for a fight Jayne, engineer Kaylie who has a crush on the Doctor- Simon, and Simon's psychic sister River who carries a terrible secret which the Alliance will do anything to keep secret. Also returning are companion Inara and preacher Book who have both left the ship Serenity during the few months between the tv show and the film.<br /><br />So here I was, finally watching this movie that due to its original release date being delayed, I'd felt like I'd waited ages to see, and for the most part it delivered. There was plenty of action, humor, fun and excitement. It was also easy for newcomers to not only follow, but enjoy- something which the Star Trek movies had problems accomplishing. Creator/Writer/Director Joss Whedon though has succeeded on this issue very well.<br /><br />So why did I feel that little bit disappointed?<br /><br />Well, you see the thing is, I've been a fan of Joss Whedon's work for a long time. He has done amazing work on tv shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel. Also, it was in 1992 that he'd written the movie version of Buffy The Vampire Slayer and the director had taken the film in a direction Joss Whedon did not want it to go- now with Serenity he had an opportunity to direct a movie the way he intended and I believe Serenity to be a representation of what Joss Whedon wanted the film to be. Unfortunately, the big screen limits how far you can take the characters because since the movie is on the big screen, the main plot has to take priority over everything else. Thus themes and emotions can get lost. For example, one of the main themes in Serenity is that you should believe no matter what- well I am used to Joss addressing a theme and then taking it further- he didn't take it very far here, and in fact he addressed the same issue in-depth in the Season 5 Premiere of Angel- Conviction. As for emotions- I remember great emotional moments in Buffy and Angel where Buffy killed Angel, Buffy died for the second time and Fred died. All big emotional points that I knew were going to happen long before I actually saw them on screen, yet when I did finally see them, they did affect me. With Serenity I knew the two characters that were going to die because I'd read the screenplay, yet I was barely affected at all because the main plot was the priority at the time in the film. And even when we did finally catch-up to the loss in the funeral scene at the end, I still felt empty. In contrast, whenever I see Spock die in Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan I can still feel the hurt, despite knowing he'll be back in the third Star Trek movie. I get this sense that no matter how many times I watch Serenity, I won't feel the emotion of losing the two characters that died. The family atmosphere established in the series doesn't appear to be as strong either. And the person to blame for that I'm afraid to say is the man himself- Joss Whedon. Granted, I'm sure he made various concessions for the big screen but it's a shame certain opportunities were missed. I actually wanted River to make me cry but she didn't- makes me cry that she didn't make me cry.<br /><br />So in summary, this is a fun movie that should convert newcomers to the Joss Whedon universe and entertain those already loyal to his work, but it doesn't show the true greatness of Joss that I'd hoped for. I only give it 5 stars in this review, because I've already given 4 stars to a lot less. Still, despite any nitpicky flaws, a sequel would be welcome. We may get one we may not. And if we don't, Serenity serves as a somehow appropriate ending to the Firefly and Serenity saga.l, despite any nitpicky flaws, a sequel would be welcome. We may get one we may not.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a great show, a show that could have been greater.  With only 14 episodes, many of which were never aired, this character-driven, action packed, sci-fi TV series really was never given a chance.  With such wonderful episodes as War Stories and Out Of Gas it should have been around for five or six seasons.  This DVD set gives you all of it, with added audio commentary on some of the episode, deleted scenes, a gag reel, behind-the-scene features and even a Easter Egg of Adam Baldwin singing the Hero Of Canton.  With the movie out maybe they will think about re-starting the show?<br /><br />New or used this is a MUST for any sci-fi library.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This has to be the best 1/2 season that was cancelled due to poor network management EVER!  <br />You wont be dissapointed - Sci-Fi fans and not-so Sci-Fi fans alike will love these episodes!
0684833395|5.0|hit home was a verry good if not bizzare book that seemed to be a little too honest allthough blantantly fiction
B00005221M|4.0|The Last of the Mohicans was a great movie and the acting was superb.  We watched it in 8th grade history class over several days.  <br />The war scenes were very exciting.  <br />This movie helped me understand the history of the Native Americans better. <br />  <br />
B000A88F22|5.0|This is NOT a reality show, but that's why it's so enjoyable!!  This shows Britney meeting and falling in love with Kevin Federline on the European leg of her \\"Onyx Hotel Tour\\" last year.  This all leads up to their much talked about wedding on September 18, 2004.  What you see on this DVD is very rough and unplanned.  It is NOTHING like a reality show.  In the extra scenes, you see even wilder things like Britney getting accupuncture, Kevin getting a shot in his butt, and Britney teaching us a dance routine she made up with her friends when she was younger.  The bonus CD features only 3 songs, but they are still very good.  Track 1 is the theme song \\"Chaotic\\", track 2 is \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\", and track 3 in the new and improved version of \\"Mona Lisa\\"!!!  Buy this now and you won't regret it!!
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I have seen every episode and I think that season 5 and up are the best.  Logan is so cute.  Logans father is so mean tho.  This season is full of suprises!  I LOVE IT!!!!!
B000BBYMA2|5.0|What a movie! This is got to be up there in my fav movies of all time. I would give it a title like horror or action but it really does not fit into a catagory of film. <br />A class is randomly selected to participate in the battle royale a law passed to clean up scociety by basically killing an intire 9th grade class. how you ask. by giving them wepons on a deserted island sending them off with exploding dog collars and giving them 3 days to have one student hailed as the winner. If those three days are up all the collars will explode. Imagine what it would be like to have to kill your best friend or girl friend to save your own life. Could you even do it? thats what battle royale makes you ask yourself. Is the human instinct of survival that strong to make you kill the people you love. this is just one hell of a movie with a unrelenting story and a question of human survival.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|Before I dive into the review, I want to try and dispell some myths appearing on this review page. A lot of people say that \\"Scary Monsters\\" is Bowie's last great innovative work of music, and his last essential album. I insist that if you're a fan just getting into Bowie, take all of his albums very seriously because the man is a genius. Regardless of innovation or anything, Bowie makes brilliant music. <br /> <br />The problem may be that \\"Scary Monsters\\" is hard to live up to. If you're in the proper mood for it, \\"Scary Monsters\\" will absolutely blow you away. It's dark, edgy, and sometimes bizzare, but it's always brilliant. The album is basically the culmination of Bowie's experimental \\"Berlin\\" period. This is validated by the fact that all three \\"Berlin\\" albums' art appears on the \\"Scary Monsters\\" album art. What really stands out on this album is the emotion in the vocals, lyrics, the cohesiveness of it as a whole work, and the variety of sounds that keep it from ever getting boring. <br /> <br />I will warn you though, the album is a grower. You may have to have it for a while before it strikes you, but give it a chance. On prior listens you'll be anticipating the various climaxes if you take the time to find them. <br /> <br />Not necessarily recommended as an album for a Bowie newcomer, but easily one of the most rewarding album you could ever get into.
B000002HMH|1.0|THIS IS PURE S##T. THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON THIS CD IS \\"UNTIL IT SLEEPS\\" THE ONLY GOOD SONG. THE REST IS PURE CRAP. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR BETTER METALLICA. PASS LOAD AND RELOAD. ITS NOT WORTH ONE F**KING CENT.
B000AV2G3I|5.0|Why another compilation?  Well, given that John Lennon's catalogue is still in print and continuing to sell, this set gives those potential buyers another option.  And in my opinion it's a good one.  Two CDs with 38 mostly essential tracks (and missing a few such as \\"Crippled Inside,\\" but of course there's no single perfect track lineup that will please everybody).      This is definitely the best Lennon anthology out there, at the very least because it has twice as much material than any of the existing single-disc CDs, and has up-to-date remastering.  I never could get into the idea that Lennon's solo career could be adequately captured on one disc.  Two discs are more reasonable.  Anyone who doesn't have the time or money to pick up all of the individual albums should seriously consider this set.      WORKING CLASS HERO has the key post-Beatles singles (\\"Cold Turkey,\\" \\"Instant Karma,\\" etc.), five tracks from John's most highly-acclaimed album (1970's PLASTIC ONO BAND), another five from the popular disc IMAGINE (1971), and so on.  Maybe a couple more from POB could have bumped a couple of this collection's less-essential moments, but all-in-all the tracks are well-chosen.      The music isn't in chronological order, which is an important factor for fans who recognize many of the tracks have a connection to the period in which they were recorded (e.g., the \\"primal scream\\" period of POB, the 1980 \\"comeback,\\" etc.).  But that alone shouldn't discourage any potential buyers from picking up this almost-definitive collection.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Guillermo del Toro(of \\"The Cronos Device\\" and \\"Hellboy\\") steps in to direct this sequel to \\"Blade\\", enhancing an already iconic hero with his own unique and wonderfully extravagant touches. This time around, Blade(again portrayed with power by Wesley Snipes)starts out once more out to destroy the vampires who created the lonely world in which he is doomed to live. But there is a twist to this tale: Blade is forced to double up with this deadly race in order to pursue a far greater threat to mankind, something that the vampire race is deathly afraid of. Without giving away the entire plot, I will say there are plenty of social messages in this story. If the first movie was erotic and sensual, this is insane with beauty, madness, and action. The special effects are skillfully and brilliantly done, the music and sets mind-boggling, the story packed with enough mayhem to last a lifetime. Producer Peter Frankfurt, a great artist in his own right, lends a couple of touches to a movie that will last forever in the world of vampire legends in cinema.
0780624890|5.0|\\"Blade\\" is a movie based on the \\"blaxploitation\\" comic book of the 70s. But tarted-up much more nicely in the film! It's a story of good vs evil, of a half-breed vampire who can't come to grips with who he is, fighting both his own blood hunger and the vampires who are threatening to eliminate mankind from the face of the earth. It's modern, slick, innovative, and beautiful to look at. The direction shows genius and more than makes up for it's occassional blunders with style and grace, mixed with generous helpings of blood and sensuality. An erotic and exciting movie, full of music and color. Total eye-candy for the eye and ear, and a story for the heart. As for Wesley Snipes, who portrays Blade, well, need I say more? <br />
B0001MDPV8|5.0|I know i'm a white guy from New Mexico, and I know my street cred is next to nothing, but Illmatic by Nas has to be the greatest hip hop album ever recorded.  It features the best lyrical performance since Rakim on Paid in Full, it has some of the best beats ever made by the likes of DJ Premier and Large Professor.  And it's also trim; ten songs, no skits, none of crap you hear on almost every hip hop release today.   <br /> <br />Nas's performance on this album is visionary.  Most rappers go from point A to point B in a rap, hit a chorus and that's it.   A definite disciple of Rakim, his lyrics move in a fluid way.  I have probably listened to this album 100 times, and I always pick up some subtle nuance in his delivery that I haven't heard before.  His lyrical content stradles the line between the burgeoning hardcore rap of the time like the Wu-Tang Clan and Biggie and groups from the late 80's artistic peak like A Tribe Called Quest.  Q-Tip even produces One Love, arguably the best song on the album.  Nas does use his fair share of profanity, but it doesn't seem to be for simple over indulgence like 50 Cent or any number of modern MC's.   <br /> <br />Illmatic is an album filled with ten classics and no filler.  This is hip hop 101 kids.  If your a hip hop fan and don't own this album, then anything you say on the subject is suspect.  After this Nas has put out some decent material but nothing essential.  Though the album is great, the bonus disc on the tenth aniversary edition is kind of unnecessary.  Nothing really strong here, so buy the regular version instead.
B00005YUNY|5.0|In this case, we love when they play!  This is an accomplishment that will be appreciated in the highest way by real YES fans.  Not just the bands performance, which is professional and powerful (Steve Howe shows his refined spirit and superb ability, despite the criticisms from some on here), but Tom Brislin the highly capable (and high strung) keyboardist along with Wilhelm Keitel and his orchestra take the songs to a very fine space.  There is quite a mutual lovefest going on between the grateful fans and the musicians.  Energy is pouring forth in both directions, as it should be when the atmosphere is this charged.  Many of the long reviews below go in to appropriate detail and give the song by song highlights, and there are many!  I have to say, it gets annoying when some people focus on form (or image) over substance and criticize Howe's demeanor (this is the same guy here we all know and love - he's all about the music, not show) or gripe that they think his guitar tone sounds wimpy (as if ANY of the detractors could touch the sounds he creates - his tone is spot-on for the occasion...his judgment seems good to me).  Jon is Jon...his voice, song-writing ability and spiritual presence inpire many of us, he sounds as good as ever.  If every singer had to have a super-cool, strutting stage presence to look like the perfect rock star, and screeched the obligatory Metallica death growl, how boring would that be?  I don't have any idea how someone can be a YES fan and still be hung-up by Jon's voice or spirituality...this is fundamental to the YES magic, get over it!  Saying that Squire seems to be imbibing???  What a load of crap - he obviously is there, that night, to lend his uncompromising musical ability and perfectionism to this event and pulls it off with a soaring performance, as usual!  Other YES events with Squire missing ARE missing something fundamental - HIM!  How many musicians perform under the  influence of something?  Why would his supposed use of anything even bring a comment?  I wouldn't be surprised if someone decided they didn't like it because Chris Squire's pants are too tight or shoes too big!  I might as well give kudos to Alan White's great and meditative performance as well.  He is very in tune with the orchestra throughout.  I know!  Many of you go on and on how Dream Theater's drummer is way more impressive, or this or that new band shows YES a thing or two...like YES fans care???  They are not YES!  This band does it's own unique and powerful thing, if others don't feel it or get it, go listen to Guns 'n' Roses.  Let's give credit where it is due as they say and THANK YES FOR GOING TO THIS HUGE EFFORT to please the fans and take their wonderful songs higher with this very interesting arrangement.  I have no doubt that lovers of this sort of prog-rock will be very content with this great dvd.  Maybe the rest of the catalogue can be brought into the fold for a few other Symphonic YES cds (this music is very adaptable to further orchestration).  The sound and production are very nice, and the camera highlights individuals at the right moments for the most part - I can't get enough!  If you love this band, JUST GET IT, it is an excellent and inspiring event (and YES I'm thrilled that Gates of Delerium and Ritual made it on here, more of Topographic would have been even better).  Lift a glass to the band, THEY ROCK!!  P.S. I got the limited edition with the extra 75 minute cd included...NICE EXTRA!anything even bring a comment?

B0009IW88A|5.0|Brooding, sinister and violent soundtrack, with lots of quotations from Wagner and other romantic composers, produced in an electronic environment.<br /><br />Zimmer's music for The Thin Red Line stands out as one of the most gripping scores ever to feature in a movie; the music for \\"Batman Begins\\" equals that in intensity, imaginative power and sheer scariness.<br /><br />Part of the reason this recording works so well separated from the movie is that it comes over as a coherent collection of musical essays (on the theme of monstrous bats, full of flapping, leathery wings, the pounding of strained hearts and the headlong rush of predator and prey).<br /><br />Great fun to listen to if you need to write a dark novel (as I do) and highly recommended to almost everybody.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|Great documentary, but I wish there could have been more.  Dylan has had a long career.   And obviously this documentary could have been 5 times longer.   <br /> <br />Stopping at 1966 is only teasing and is insufficient for a true Dylan fan.   <br /> <br />Would you stop a Beatles documentary at Revolver? <br /> <br />
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This album is great, better than \\"( )\\" and \\"Von\\", but not as good as \\"Agaetis Byrjun.\\" [...] They say this is Sigur Ros' first album in Icelandic, thats total BS. Do some research Amazon.com, this is Sigur Ros' third album in Icelandic. They released one album, that right just one album, in \\"Hopelandic.\\" It just pisses me off that you guys can't do a little bit of research.

6305212112|5.0|This is just a great movie.  I love fiction about the south and this film adaptation of Fannie Flagg's novel Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe is the best of the best. <br /> <br />It is a great story, visually pleasing.  The acting by everyone is top notch.  The director and producer of this film are to be commended for finding a location to capture the mood of Flagg's novel.  Kathy Bates as the endearing, taken for granted, house wife is wonderful.  Mary Stuart Masterson as the hero of this story, Idgie Threadgoode, is captivating.  Add to this the nursing home resident, story teller, Ninny Threadgoode, played by Jessica Tandy, and you have a treat for the eyes and ears.  And we can't forget Mary-Louise Parker as Idgie's friend Ruth Jamison.   <br /> <br />Fried Green Tomatoes should be in you DVD collection.
0316172324|4.0|This book is full of highly entertaining and thought-provoking psychology studies, true life stories, etc.    But the oraganization as a book has major flaws.  Here are three:        1. TMIS - Too Much Information Syndrome.      2. Hard-to-follow Organization, from cover to cover.      3. Evidence doesn't support main arguments.    ****************************************  1. TMIS - Too Much Information Syndrome.    ****************************************  One hugely ironic example: When the author tried to demonstrate that when doctors at Cook County Hospital Emergency Department treat chest-pain patients, many seemingly important medical details (e.g. drinking habits) can be ignored (for more accurate diagnosis! yes, no kidding!) and therefore help more patients, he writes:         \\"[The department head] was raised in New York City, the product of a classical Jesuit      education: Regis for High School, where he had four years      of Latin and Greek, and Fordham University for college,       where he read everything from the ancients to Wittgenstein       and Heidegger and thought about an academic career in       philosophy...\\"     How are these details related to the main message?  And they are not even remotely important at all.    *******************************************************  Second, Hard-to-follow organization, from cover to cover.  *******************************************************  Just two examples among many:     The introduction chapter tells the reader about the three tasks of the book.  That's nice, but if you want to find them, good luck.  They are buried in the middle of 2nd section:\\"The Internal Computer\\" (and first two tasks are in the middle of paragraphs).      The closing chapter tells us the two lessons of Blink (sort of).    The first lesson (\\"We are often careless about our snap judgement\\") isn't obvious until the reader encounters the mentioning of the second lesson and it is at the third sentence of second paragraph of page 252:     The second lesson, which begins as a second sentence in last paragraph on page 252, is about we can make our snap judgement better.     *******************************************************  Third, Evidence doesn't directly support main arguments.  *******************************************************  A pair of contrasting examples of this flaw are in Chapter 4: Creating Structure for Spontaneity.  From the title I'd assume the author will show us creating a structure can spawn (good) spontaneity (and maybe how to create a structure, etc.)    The author presents two long, long cases.    First case is about a Pantagon war game in 2002.  This includes an inspiring account of the more \\"spontaneous\\" team won the war game.  But not much is said about how structure was built or how structure helped or what the structure was.      Second case is about Emergency Department of the Chicago Cook County Hospital.  This example has a stunning tale of how doctors used a structured approach to improve their treatment of patients.  But nothing is said about \\"spontaneity\\".     ******************    5 stars for nuggets of fascinating information in this book.  2 stars for many flaws for it.  Round up to 4 -:)
B0001UL7RY|1.0|THIS album sucks i should ve read the reviews before i bought this album
B000002GVO|5.0|Hotel California. The ultimate classic from the Eagles. Is there truly someone out there who does not know that guitar solo? <br /> <br />Many artists put their best songs deep into the album so listeners had to go through other works to get to it. The Eagles started out with a classic and just kept going. The guitar, meaning and harmonies in Hotel California were just awesome. I used to listen to this every few days while I was a youngster. \\"New Kid in Town\\" drops down to the love-won, love-lost sadness that most of us have gone through.  <br /> <br />Then we get hit with another classic - \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" that again just about everybody can relate to. Whether it's booze, drugs, or just a life out of control, we've all had that feeling that we were going to crash and had lost an ability to stop. <br /> <br />Even the later songs are really enjoyable. I've always liked the rhythms of \\"Victim of Love\\" and the quieter sounds of \\"Pretty Maids All In a Row\\". This isn't just a single cookie-cutter song repeated over and over again. Each song on the album really has its own flavor. <br /> <br />One of my favorite albums. <br />
B0002858YS|5.0|IF you need something mellow to listen to, say when you are studying, driving, or just hanging around, it is great. You just pop it in and it keeps your mind off of outside distractions.
B000002KGT|5.0|Fleetwood Mac was a band that got a great deal of attention in the 70s and 80s. Rumors had at least song from each band member! <br /> <br />Right from the start, you get the sense that this album is about love lost, love regained, and the pain in between. \\"Secondhand News\\" is a boppy song that had a guy pleading for his girl to take him back, even if it's only for an occasional roll in the hay. Dreams has Stevie singing about the ups and downs of love - \\"when the rain washes you clean, you'll know.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Never Going Back Again\\" has guitar work that I really enjoy, and again its happy, upbeat tune seems to try to add a happy face to what is in essence a very sad song - \\"Been down one time, been down two times - never going back again.\\" The next song, \\"Don't Stop\\" is more upbeat, and tries to say that tomorrow will be better. <br /> <br />\\"You Can Go Your Own Way\\" is a sad song of breaking up, but again looks at the bright side. It's just the way it is, and life has to go on.  <br /> <br />But if I had to choose a real favorite here, it is \\"Songbird\\". When I was growing up, this was very meaningful - it really seemed to say that no matter what the troubles, you could look for that silver lining.  <br /> <br />I could go on and on. Each song has its own poignant message. Yes, you can call them easy-California-pop ... but these songs weren't invented by some sort of a recording studio. This band was really going through the traumas involved. \\"If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me,\\" they sing in \\"Oh, Daddy\\" - and they mean it.  <br /> <br />For millions of fans, we understand completely what they're saying.
B0000942LT|5.0|This CD, is the only CD is was lacking by Staind. I recently bought it, and after listening to all the tracks several times, I came out confused. Always, Staind has many strong songs on their albums, but on this one, I can't pick a definitive number of best tracks. Every song on this CD is good, most more than good. I recommend this CD, along with all of Staind's others, with full marks.
B000001DQI|5.0|Elton John and his fantastic piano playing were already legend when he came out with the double album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. <br /> <br />You can tell right from the beginning that this is not your typical rock album. The music is more symphonic than rock, and is great to play on a high quality stereo, the sound filling the nooks and crannies of the room. It moves smoothly into \\"Love Lies Bleeding\\" to get you on your feet dancing, ready for the rest of the music. <br /> <br />Amazingly, the ride keeps going. \\"Candle in the Wind\\" is a song the entire world knows now - first as a tribute to Marilyn Monroe, then redone as a tribute to Princess Diana. In both cases it is quite fitting and poignant. <br /> <br />I've always loved Bennie and the Jets, with its jazzy rhythm and rainstorm-like applause in the background. It's a great song for sitting on the back porch, sipping some wine.  <br /> <br />And then, the ultimate. \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" was a theme song of mine for a while - anybody stuck in a bad relationship can instantly relate to this song. You just want to get out, back to your own place. Elton hasn't created cookie cutter songs here - each one strikes its own chord. <br /> <br />The list goes on and on, with songs that are both well known and more obscure. Each one has the potential to hit that chord in you, if you take the time to listen. Highly recommended, and one of my treasured albums from this era.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This CD is one of Christina's best vocally. She brings new life into some Christmas tracks in which one may refer to as boring or dull. This Year, This Christmas and Xtina's song are the best songs on this album, but honestly, there is no dull tracks. Christina is by favourite artist of all-time by far and think that she is very very underrated in some aspects. If you enjoyed this release, or Christina's music in general, I would recommend all of her albums (especially STRIPPED which is my favourite album of all time), or if you are looking for something different, maybe something by Whitney Houston or to a lesser extent Mariah Carey<br /><br />96%
B000002KHY|5.0|James Taylor certainly deserves his Greatest Hits album. The smooth voice and guitar work stand out on every song. What makes the album even more fantastic is the collection of talented musicians who join him for these songs. <br /> <br />\\"Fire and Rain\\" has got to be my favorite. It's not your classic top-hit song. It's quiet, it's sad, it sort of hopeless. It really sounds like James is at the end of his rope, having lost his last chance. \\"I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend - but I always thought that I'd see you again.\\"  <br /> <br />Some of the other songs are more upbeat - the \\"Shower the People\\" and \\"How Sweet it Is\\" are both much more encouraging about life. You've got \\"Carolina in my Mind\\" - anybody who has wandered the rolling hills and gorgeous coastlines of this area can truly relate. <br /> <br />I'm a fan of Carole King, and I really like this version of \\"You've Got a Friend\\". James' voice is so quiet and soothing, you really get a sense that he'll be there for you. <br /> <br />Perfect for an evening by the fire, sipping that glass of wine.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is beautiful, plain and simple. I disagree with the many who say you have to listen to it several times to enjoy it. For me, it was a pleasure the first time through.  <br /> <br />But like anything that is truly beautiful, you do appreciate the many levels and textures of the tracks in this album more and more with each listen. It's complex and it's different and more than anything it is powerful - and not everyone likes that. Radiohead is a unique voice in a world saturated with bland, empty pop trash, and this album surely ranks among the greats of all time.
B000001EC1|4.0|I admit it. I grew up listening to Bon Jovi. The power ballad, the sing-along-at-the-top-of-your-lungs, they were hard to resist at times! <br /> <br />I really love \\"Livin' On a Prayer\\". You get a sense that this couple is really struggling - but that they're going to make it because they keep trying. Given the number of disasters that hit our world, it's an encouraging thought. <br /> <br />I've always enjoyed \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" - that guitar riff is just so haunting, and the sense that the band is adrift and carried along is a lot like \\"Faithfully\\" by Journey. They give you a glimpse into the down-side of being a big band. <br /> <br />\\"Blaze of Glory\\" is another great one for me, another one to sing along at the top of my lungs. Maybe I watched westerns a little too much growing up, but the power behind the song really gets to me. \\"I don't know where I'm going - only God knows where I've been\\". I feel like that sometimes. <br /> <br />Really, there's something to be said for pretty much any song here. \\"Runaway\\" calls to mind the times it really did seem like a valid solution, taking off into the night. \\"Lay your hands on me\\" has an attraction of a different type. <br /> <br />Yes, these are hot-rock-blasts for playing loud as you drive your car down the freeway at top speed. If that's the music you enjoy, you'll be thrilled with this!
B000002MP2|4.0|Do you have the time... to listen to me whine...  Sorry, I just can't get that Basketcase song out of my head. Buy this album if you don't already have it it's just fantastic. Who cares if it's 11 years out of date? True fans would listen to it whether it was out of date or not. If you like it for a while and then decide you don't like it just 'cos it's gone out of fashion, you are not a true fan. You are a teenybopper just jumping on the bandwagon to be with the 'in' crowd. That doesn't mean you can't listen to fashionable music, just don't act like a teenybopper. Anyway, there are some bands these days who can't even sing in tune and it makes you wonder how on Earth they got into the  charts. Greenday is NOT one of them. They have true talent, and, not to brag, but I should know 'cos I know good singing/music talent when I see it. And as for all you people who think this album sucks, what the heck is wrong with you? Don't listen to people who say it sucks 'cos it doesn't. It may not be the latest anymore but it's definitely one of the greatest. As all the Greenday albums are.  You go, Greenday!
B000065V9Y|5.0|Peter Gabriel - US - is one of my favorite CDs. The soul-wrenching lyrics and singing bring new meaning to the term Soul Baring. <br /> <br />Peter Gabriel wrote this group of songs after divorcing his long-time wife, and also breaking up with a subsequent girlfriend. At the same time that he was going through these traumas, he was working on the soundtrack for The Last Temptation of Christ. Talk about a powerful wellspring. <br /> <br />My favorite two tracks on this CD are easily Blood of Eden and Washing of the Water. I could replay those two tracks over and over again, just getting lost in their depths. You can hear Gabriel really resonating with the songs, letting you hear the hurt and pain in his life. <br /> <br />In Come Talk to Me, the rock jazziness to the song almost makes you forget just how angst-filled his plea is - he's trying to make it lighthearted, but he desperately wants his lover to come work this out with him. Even the guitar has a ragged edge to it as it accompanies him. <br /> <br />Steam is more of a sexual purr, and to me it shows at least that he was trying to get a handle on his negative emotions and regain a footing in life. The visual imagery is fantastic. <br /> <br />For pure fun, I really love Kiss that Frog. But again, this isn't pop-culture with Someone saying \\"I wanna kiss!!\\" It Gabriel bringing in more of his water metaphors, and trying to say that love doesn't have to be about a pretty face - that someone should take a chance with him, warts and all, to find happiness. <br /> <br />I suppose if someone was looking for 'hip fun polished rock music' they might be confused at what this CD is all about. It's not a industry-cranked sales machine. It is really Gabriel, pouring out his heart. I for one find that it touches me incredibly, and that I can really relate to every song on the CD. <br />
0393307050|5.0|This is the first of the series of books about the adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey of His Majesty's Royal Navy, and his friend Stephen Maturin, a Natural Philosopher (biologist) and ship's surgeon. The story opens in Port Mahon, a British possession in the Mediterranean Sea, at the dawn of the 19th century, when England stands virtually alone in the war against the forces of Napoleon. As the series begins, Lieutenant Jack Aubrey is given his promotion to Master & Commander, and placed in command of a sloop called the Sophie. In his festive mood and urge to celebrate, he encounters in the town a man with whom he had an unpleasant encounter the previous evening, a transient and apparently destitute physician named Stephen Maturin. He invites the near-stranger to celebrate with him. Thus is born an unlikely friendship of two widely disparate individuals that will last their whole lives.    Throughout the story, we learn quite a bit about the characters of Jack and Stephen. Jack is depicted as something of a buffoon on land, but a natural warrior at sea; an amalgamation of the greatest British naval heroes of the time. At times, there almost seem to be two Jack Aubreys: Jack on land, and Jack at sea. On land, Jack is somewhat blustery and full of his own station in life, someone who considers himself far more of an intellectual than he truly is. At sea, he is perfectly in his element, a brilliant tactician and gifted commander. Stephen embodies the spirit of scientific advancement of the time period. Half Irish, half Catalonian, an expatriate of both nations, one isn't sure if he's running from some darker past as he agrees to join Jack in sailing around the Mediterranean to places unknown. His reasons for being in Mahon are somewhat vague, but he claims to have nothing holding him to the area, and so agrees to join Jack in his new command.    But the truly brilliant work here is how O'Brian makes these characters come richly alive on the page. Apart from Jack and Stephen, a host of other characters are introduced to the reader, and we become immersed in the life of the Sophie at sea, learning most of the sailors by name. The characterization of each is unique, and several of them return over the course of the series. In this first volume, Jack forges bonds and finds himself in conflict with various members of those under his command and above him. Most notably he finds himself clashing with James Dillon, his firey Irish first lieutenant who has, unbeknownst to Jack, a history of subversive conflict against England itself.    The vocabulary in the book can be a bit difficult to follow if one is not familiar with Age of Sail terminology. I knew next to nothing about it; couldn't tell you the difference between a lateen and a halyard when I picked up the book, let alone the perils of a leeward shore. But some of these terms and concepts are introduced to the reader through Maturin, who is also totally ignorant of naval matters. As characters on the ship explain various aspects of naval life, the reader becomes familiar with it as well, and it becomes easier to follow as the book goes on. Much of the vocabulary can be figured out from context, or failing that, with the help of a good dictionary. We learn that the rank of Master & Commander is not a true captain, but called captain only by custom and courtesy. Jack's true ambition is to be promoted to Post Captain, the next rank up from where he is, and from there he has only to live long enough and he will become an admiral as those above him die off.    Jack and Stephen share the spotlight as the hero of the story, each for different reasons. Both are drawn in colorful detail, though much of Stephen remains a mystery still by the end of this book. Both are more fully fleshed out in the rest of the series, and become two of the most memorable and detailed characters in modern fiction.    O'Brian's fiction fits seamlessly into the real history of the time, with a few admitted changes made in the chronology of events, as well as the actual ships present in any particular engagement. A small 14-gun sloop-of-war, the fictional Sophie under Captain Aubrey becomes the terror of the Mediterranean, and garners her captain the nickname of \\"Lucky Jack Aubrey.\\" The prose is totally immersive, bringing the reader into the age through language taken directly from the Regency period. The action is brilliantly detailed, making one feel as if they are standing on the deck of the ship in the heat of battle, seeing everything that goes on in a ship-to-ship engagement.    The action is plentiful in this volume of the series, and at times it may seem too episodic. Some of the fights in the book aren't truly instrumental to the story, but there are relatively few of them described in that level of detail. O'Brian got most of his material directly from the records of the official naval archives, and created characters, events, and personal observations from letters and journals surviving from the times. A great deal of research went into these stories, and O'Brian brings them to life for the reader in vivid detail as if giving us a time machine to take us back in person.    A truly enjoyable book in its own right, Master & Commander begins a series that transports the reader back in time, to an age of \\"wooden ships and iron men.\\" Once begun, the series is hard to put down, but at 20 books (plus the unfinished 21st), it represents quite a commitment in one's reading schedule. But with the skill with which O'Brian creates his characters and stories, the books pass all too quickly, always leaving us hungry for more.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King is simply an amazing songwriter and singer that pours her emotion and being in each song. You can hear her hurt, her pain, and her hope. <br /> <br />This isn't a helpless, \\"please come and rescue me\\" princess. She's going to stand on her own two feet and try to get through life as best as she can. On \\"it's too late\\" she says right out, \\"one of us has changed, or maybe we've just stopped trying\\".  <br /> <br />I really connect with \\"So Far Away\\", the angst of being apart from those you love. Sometimes it's distance that separates you - but sometimes it's time. <br /> <br />\\"You've Got a Friend\\" of course is another true classic. We've all been there, sad and depressed. We've all wanted someone to just come and hold us, and tell us it's going to be better soon. She has that voice of someone you can trust, someone you can turn to. <br /> <br />While Natural Woman is a nice power song that speaks to every woman out there, I still have to vote for Tapestry as being my favorite on this set. The words paint a vivid painting of what is going on in the story, it really is like a musical tapestry that envelopes you. <br /> <br />Highly recommended! <br />
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This IS the album of the year- hands down.  Epic, sweeping, quiet, haunting, beautiful.  Once in a while, an album comes along and galvanizes you and shakes you to the core- in a wonderful way- Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\", Wilco's \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\", Arcade Fire's \\"Funeral\\" come to mind... and now Sufjan Stevens' \\"Illinois\\"!  There's no point in trying to verbalize this magnificent gift of an album.  Just listen.  Thank you, Sufjan!
B000AL730O|3.0|Chaos and Creation is not Abby Road.  It is not Band on the Run.  It's not bad though, which is always a relief.  \\"Vanity Fair\\", \\"At the Mercy\\" and \\"Too Much Rain\\" are all good, somber songs.  How often do you get to say that about a McCartney tune?  And if you liked \\"Warm and Beautiful\\" on Speed of Sound, you'll love \\"This Never Happened Before\\" and \\"Follow Me.\\" <br /> <br />McCartney still needs someone to tell him when his lyrics are trite.  Second verses kill him on \\"English Tea\\" and \\"Jenny Wren.\\" <br /> <br />The album is mostly ballads.  \\"Fine Line\\" is a moderate rocker.  I wont be singing it in five years, but it's catchy, it tries to say something important, and it should sound good live. <br /> <br />Chaos and Creation holds its own with mid-seventies Wings, or with Flowers in the Dirt.  If you're a hard core McCartney fan, you'll find plenty of stuff to like.  If you think McCartney hasn't done anything since '69, this won't change your mind.
B00005OAIE|5.0|James Taylor, Paul Simon, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jimi Hendrix, B.B. King.  He's got a good way of playing guitar like B.B. King, he can be a rock 'n' roller like Jimi Hendrix and Steve Ray Vaughn and he's got the ability to rhyme like Paul Simon and most importantly the sensitivity of James Taylor. <br /> <br />John Mayer is without a doubt a breath of fresh air.
0156027321|3.0|Overall, Life of Pi is a wonderful book. It opens the reader up to new horizons and forces him to dwell upon things that the average person would never normally experience. Pi's messages on religion and his insight about survival really engage the reader and give another outlook on life. It caused me to appreciate the life that I have. I agree with Pi's comment on the fact that everyone's mission is just to love God. In other words, what particular religion you belong to is not what is important. In my opinion, this was one of the main messages of the book, and I think that it is significant for everyone in all religions to realize this concept. However, I found Pi's constant struggle for survival to be quite repetitive after awhile, and at some times I became sick to my stomach. I also think that the two solutions offered in the ending, which the entire second part of the book led up to, caused the reader to lose trust in Pi's honesty. I don't think it matched up to the rest of the book, which is so good. That is what caused me to have mixed feelings about the book. But in general, I would recommend the book to anyone, because it is truly a remarkable adventure for Pi and a dramatic learning experience for the reader.

B000B8IA2G|5.0|I have been watching science fiction since 1961. I have seen many different types of the genre. This show is amazing. It has characters you can really get into, story lines which are truly excellent and Atlantis (the city) is a special feast in itself). I nearly didn't watch this because I had seen so many damn shows about Atlantis but I was captured by the huge storyline this show presents. If you have not seen this first season yet this is an excellent chance to see it and want to see the second season which has been even better then the first. <br />Don't look to see Stargate SG-1 because even thought the two shows are related. Stargate: Atlantis is a series in and of its own. Think big in this series and watch for some really awesome scenes. Even my Mom who is not a sci-fi person loves this series.
B00062RCBW|4.0|I purchased the whole 7 seasons and so far I love it however there is a problem with one of the DVD's. On the 4th season, the 1st DVD, the episode of \\"The Family\\", the program continually freezes through out the whole episode. There is no one to contact to find out if this happened on all the DVDs that were made. The set was brand new and still sealed so it had to have left the factory that way. In the future someone needs to have a contact address or number for situations like this so any problems can be resolved.
B000AU9UYM|3.0|I'm a huge fan of the Burton-led BATMAN movies.  I find Burton's eye for the outlandish and Keaton's quirky take on the character to be one of my top five interpretations of this aged classic.  I'm not trying to dredge up more Burton vs. Nolan debates (there are plenty of those out there), I'm simply stating that the reasons I loved Burton's movies are the very reasons I find Nolan's BEGINS to be flat and, dare I say, boring. <br /> <br />In Burton's films, much is left open to interpretation.  The story and characters are primarily developed using visuals.  This is why, if you were ever curious, there is some debate in the geek community over whether or not Selina Kyle inherited \\"cat powers\\" from the cats who saved her after her boss tried to whack her. <br /> <br />Nolan's film, on the other hand, pretty much spells everything out for the audience.  That's a nice way of putting it.  I personally felt assaulted after seeing this movie.  \\"Fear, fear, fear, it's all about fear, what's your greatest fear, I want to strike fear\\", blah blah blah.  In my opinion, there's no real sense subtlety or, for that matter, urgency.  I knew that Batman would save the day in the end and that's boring.  Contrast that with Burton's Batman, who had a lot more at stake than innocent lives in RETURNS- his potential happiness with Selina, his need to shut the Penguin and Shreck down for keeps (beyond just sending them to prison, he needed to know that order can prevail against chaos), etc.  Everything Batman believed in and his very soul were at stake which, as a viewer, is an easy thing to latch on to. <br /> <br />I found the Gotham City production design in BEGINS to be absolutely bland.  It looks like someone just rigged up some cameras in downtown Chicago and taped some dude running around in a Batman costume... which is essentially what happened.  Gotham City, as it's presented in BEGINS and in keeping with the \\"realistic\\" tone of the film, doesn't feel like an otherworldly place where people like Batman and the Scarecrow are common place... which is, in my opinion, one of it's biggest failures.  It is absolutely jarring to see an utterly realistic party scene with Bruce Wayne one minute and then see Batman (an instantly ridiculous site in the real world) beating up criminals the next. <br /> <br />Burton's Gotham City (in RETURNS, at least) was an expressionistic, claustrophobic nightmare where freaks like Batman, Catwoman, the Penguin and such are completely at home.  The gothic atmosphere perfectly serves both the characters and the plot. <br /> <br />In BEGINS, we get some good fight scenes, a \\"realistic\\" tone, an admittedly impressive car chase, some fanboy-friendly interactions between Batman and Gordon and a generally epic feeling... and also some really terrible dialog, a script that spares no expense in making sure the lowest common denominator \\"gets\\" the theme of fear, Alfred the butler reduced to window dressing, etc. <br /> <br />I didn't *love* BEGINS, but if you prefer films where the story and character development lay in the dialog instead of the visuals, this is the Batman for you.  Knock yourself out! <br /> <br />If, like me, you prefer Burton's gothic nightmares, there's not much here for you.
B0000041ZT|5.0|If Shostakovich had decided to write in the Russian folk idiom, this CD would probably be the best glimpse into that genre.<br /><br />Intending to raise the level of Soviet jazz, we now have two jazz suites scored for orchestra, but featuring instruments used in a way we don't normally hear in Shostakovich.  Using xylophone, twangy guitar, accordion, harmonica, and saxophones, we are treated to various \\"dance forms\\" such as waltzes, polkas, foxtrots, and marches.  Shostakovich goes from the militant, to the humorous, to the sensual, each with an engaging and \\"catchy\\" Russian melody and unusual orchestration.  He also orchestrates the famous \\"Tea for Two\\" into a short fantasia, which is rather whimsical.<br /><br />The 1st piano concerto is a kind of odd fit on this CD in my opinion.  More in the vein of what we are used to hearing from mainstream Shostakovich, he is rather melodic and often quotes from other works.  The bare bones orchestration of piano, trumpet, and strings gives this work a very transparent feel.  The first movement has an ominous opening theme.  The slow second movement is very exciting in its own right with its sense of drama, rarely dwelling in lugubriousness, carrying the sense of dread from the first movement.  The third movement is a sort of  recitative to the last movement.  The last movement has an unusual string mode mixture, the piano goes into a dance feel and the trumpet has some fanfare licks.  Both piano and trumpet work  together very well as separate soloists in this movement.  He ends in a fury with piano and string poundings, the piano has some raucous quotes, and the trumpet ends with fanfares.<br /><br />Overall, the performances are stellar.  The jazz suites have natural Russian flair, the slow with great sumptuousness, the fast never taking itself too seriously and never careening out of control.  The piano concerto doesn't fit the program in my opinion, but a very fine performance indeed.  This CD is a must for any collection and an easy introduction to the lighter side of Shostakovich.ction to the lighter side of Shostakovich.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|Firefly has all the things that a great show needs; I am in fact very surprised it was canceled after only its first season. It has a GREAT theme song, good acting for the most part, and good stories usually. It has some VERY charming characters, and is really sort of like a space western which makes it really quite original I think. The original Star Trek was supposedly a Space Western, a \\"Waggon Train To The Stars\\" it was called, but it didnt have the Western FEEL that Firefly ALWAYS has at the same time as its a realistic human setting along with the expected Sci-Fi space ship/space stuff. It has really quite good Special FX, and is very nicely filmed. One thing I REALLY enjoy about it is how they fit in such nice unique \\"western feeling\\" music at different times during the show.  <br /> <br />Its about those characters who are near the bottom of society due to circumstance out of their control; and whom often times have to do things which are sometimes illegal to survive. And yet it shows these characters still are human and that even though they sometimes break the law and steal, that they still have ethics and strong beliefs and even the ability to like all humans, do the right thing often times when it isnt easy. I was really really enjoying this show for the first couple of episodes.  <br /> <br />However, the bad thing about it which was the turn off for me, is how they portray sex in the show. First off, in the show, prostitution as a good and normal thing. One of the main characters is a prostitute whom they call \\"Companions\\". Prostitution is even glorified at times as they try to make it sensual and sexy and sweet. You do often hear the Captain disagree with the \\"Companions\\" chosen career, but it just isnt enough considering the extent to which they carry the sexual stuff. This was something I could sort of tolerate until they brought in a lesbian scene. Now, this show aired on TV, so its only PG-13 Im guessing. . .however, its TOTALY unnessary regardless of your beliefs to have a lesbian scene in a Sci-Fi show. Even though you dont see anything but them petting and kissing. However, when they make it out to be just a normal thing for a bi sexual prostitute to be bringing her gay lovers onto this ship as part of the story, that gets to be too much. And then, in the last episode which I watched before I said this is enough and quit watching it, they had a totaly unnessary and really quite filthy sex scene. This was not one bit a romantic sex scene. It was just raunchy even though nothing was seen. . .and, it was with a character whom they try to portray as innocent and sweet until that point; which in my mind totaly discredited the character. (For the record, I REALLY enjoyed this episode a LOT until this happened) I was so very disapointed in these aspects of the show. Everything else about it is great, and the show had REAL potential. If they had not had they sexual attitude they portray in the show, I would have given it 5 stars. AND, Im SURE the movie will be VERY well done, charming and all the good things we look for in a sci-fi action adventure movie. They made the show what it is, and a part of the show is a VERY VERY laid back and wrong view of sex in my opinion. AND, sex in a Sci-Fi REALLY ISNT nessessary. There really is no way that the sexual attitude from the show cant carry into the movie as the same people who did the show are doing the movie, and its with the same cast, and it follows the series. So, no matter how much I enjoyed the show aside from the sexual stuff, I will not be watching anymore of the episodes OR the movie.

0743537009|5.0|Stephen King's The Shining first appeared in 1977 and has enjoyed ongoing celebration as an outstanding horror story, receiving film benefits equally powerful: so it's interesting to note this classic appears on audio for the first time under the practiced voice of Campbell Scott, a film director who knows what makes good acting on stage and on recordings. The Shining is every bit as gripping and thrilling on audio as on screen: in audio every nuance of horror comes to life.
B00005JMJG|4.0|It's a definite twist on the romantic comedy.  A very artistic flick that entertains in many different ways.  Emotionally heart-breaking and appealing. <br /> <br />The only thing that contraindicts this film for general audiences is put into words by my brother, who explaining why he wouldn't watch it with my Mom, said, \\"I don't wanna have to explain it to you.\\" <br /> <br />This isn't a movie that you can watch while you're doing the dishes or reading a book.  It's not a film you can tune away from to talk baseball with the person next to you.  This movie demands the full attention of the viewer and any viewer who doesn't give it that will undoubtedly be confused and, thus, disappointed.
B000002X2B|5.0|Take a band of hippies from San Francisco's Golden Gate Park and plant the idea that they can leave all the straight laced crap behind - all they have to do is Hijack a Starship, travel 30,000 light years from earth, live, love, get high, and party - it'll all be okay.The whole plan, executed and put to music by famed musicians of the time and cause - Grace Slick and Paul Kanter, David Freiberg. They are also joined by Jerry Garcia, Graham Nash and David Crosby. Bass provided by Jack Cassady, Peter Kaukonen (Jorma's little brother) If you take it for the idealistic dreams of the drugged out counter-culture - it's a wild ride with some beautiful passages and songs. I first heard this back in 1970. I loved it as a 13 year old kid then, have bought it time and again and listen to it as often as I want to recapture those free spirited days. This soars to the heights of the social revolution for the young at the time their cause was fading. A last gasp effort to capture a starship, escape and leave all the hateful ways behind. A plan for pschyedelic utopia. The original LP opened to a black and silver lunar landscape with Paul Kantner's head rising tall from the ground -Paul's long hair had been replaced with silver cannabis leaves. It looked cool and that speaks for itself.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This is a fun movie.  It evokes much laughter, and it serves as an excellent satire of the zombie-flick horror subgenre.  I only had one problem with it. <br /> <br />It's gross. <br /> <br />I understand that this is part of what makes it a great satire for movies like Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later; but it had several scenes that made me shudder and snap my eyes shut.  I thought it my duty to warn others who, like me, get a bit squeamish watching blood, guts, and dismemberment.
B00012L786|4.0|I've reviewed many Noir films from the 40's and 50's, \\"Maltese Falcon\\" to the B film \\"Detour,\\" and loved them all, and don't get me wrong, POSS held me all the way through; the problem with this film is it's ugly misogamy, which unfortunately lives on to some extent in the film industry.   <br /> <br />Sure, Noir films demand hardboiled punks and bimbo's of loose morals, but how many times is poor Jean Peter's, an okay doll, get punched in the face or shot in the belly.  Come on, that's over-female-kill.  That last scene after all the mayhem is just laughable. <br /> <br />Okay, I know, the story in \\"Detour\\" didn't make any sense either.  These films are vehicles for an American mythology.  The men are tough, able to take a punch and give it back too.  Yeah, that's an urban John Wayne for you.  The women are essentially ladies of the evening in a cocktail dress with a heart of gold, not marriage material, so you can er, kiss `em or beat `em up if ya want depending on the hour.  Can't lay a hand on mother material I guess. <br /> <br />Richard Widmark is ludicrously cocky in his role of the pickpocket with brains.  If his old man hadn't beat him to a pulp every day after reform school, things would have been different; he's smart enough to go to Harvard, but as it is, he enjoys cracking wise in the cop house. Ya got ta love a lug like that. <br />
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Like other reviewers have said, this Batman movie was the best ever! I am going to buy it on DVD as soon as it comes out. The main thing that I loved about the movie was the villain. One reviewer mentioned that the other Batman movies were corny, and I agree. The villains were always corny and a little over-eccentric. However, the villain in Batman Begins was truly scary, and made the movie all the more suspenseful. You'll love it!
B00005JMEW|1.0|the first time i watched this i walked out of the theater partway through the animated portion.  The beginning scene is cringeworthy and so unreasonably and unnecessarily graphic - (why?  why must tarantino do this?  do we need to SEE such graphic imagery?  Ever heard of subtlety? implication?) but i figured i'd keep on watching cuz maybe the story would come through or SOMETHIN.  it didn't.  i went back later and gave it another shot, but i wasn't the least bit impressed.   <br />This film is pretty sick.  the animated portion is just so.. that anime stuff is truly nasty.  If you don't know, there's a large animated portion of the film that proceeds to show - horrifyingly - how one of the assassins comes to be the assassisin she is.  I seriously wonder at what sort of a mind enjoys this stuff.  But aside from the violence, the films story (and its manner of telling) sucked on its own merit.  The bride (thurman) gets revenge on the people that shot her, one at a time.  for some reason tarantino jumps back and forth in time.  it serves absolutely no purpose.  You remember the end of Pulp Fiction the moment you realized Jules and Vincent were in the same restaurant as Pumpkin and Honey Bunny?  Right before \\"Garcon!! Coffee!!\\"?  Nothing like that genious collision of storyline here.  And the action scenes are utterly lame - save for the very first one where the Bride fights Vivica Fox's character in the house.  THAT was very well executed fight scene.  Aside from that scene, the stuff here looks like a bad high school play.  you should watch the basically flawless wire-fu on display on a film like Crouching Tiger and compare it to what you see here - Thurman looks exactly like there is a wire pulling her back and forth over a Hollywood soundstage.  She very obviously does not know karate.  At times she seems bodily surprised that hers was being pulled in a diection she was not prepared to go.  It's ridiculous.  Not the least bit exhilarating as you hope to see in a kung fu flick.  (remember that awe you felt as a kid when you watched Bruce Lee karate his way through a picture?  You were justifiably awestruck because Lee was an artist.  Thurman is what we call a 'novice') <br />Furthermore this flick is edited terribly.  We get loooonnnng drawn out scenes where nothing much happens.  The worst such scene is the one where the bride goes to the karate masters attic to get the sword.  We see her approach the attic...  locate the sword.. approach the sword.. admire the sword... pick up the sword.. and so on.  As if T. is trying to add depth to his narrative simply by making individual scenes longer.  That doesn't work.  You just end up with a boring film.  You gotta give us something to CHEW on T!
B000A59PMO|5.0|I avoided the show at first. Aside from the final 2 seasons of Buffy, I never watched anything on the UPN. When a friend loaned me her homemade \\"Best of\\" Veronica Mars DVD to watch, I was hooked. I was able to catch the last 6 episodes of the season on original airing and caught up over the summer with reruns. I'm looking forward to the DVD because unlike other shows, I can watch almost any season 1 episode over and over again and not get bored. The one liners are GREAT. The emotions are BIG. And the characters are REAL. Veronica Mars is proof that there is such a thing as great television.
0895260131|5.0|Of the two books in the \\"Politically Incorrect Guide to\\" series of which I am aware, this one has garnered 128 reviews, the other 5 as of this date (the other, \\"The Policically Incorrect Guide to American History\\" I highly recommend.<br /><br />I would say that in 2005 (the publishing imprimatur) Mr. Spencer has taken on a controversial subject that cannot be ignored.  Often treatises on Islam are criticised for taking the Koran (or Qur'an, or however you believe is the politically correct spelling--rememeber the cultural revolution in China which led to changes in the writing of all manner of Chinese political names?)...well, what one person can call the \\"religion of peace\\" is supported by another's literal guide to terrorism and emulation of Muhammad's acts based on the principle that \\"when you meet the infidel (non-fundamentalist Muslim) on the road, slit his--or her--throat).  Conversion at the blade of a knife is not conversion.  Or is it?<br /><br />This book should be read by all Americans--I think it can be understood at the 10th grade reading level at least, and should be in the curriculum of any basic political science, philosophy, theology, or world affairs syllabus.  There are similar books (such as \\"Preachers of Hate\\") but this is eminently readable--somewhere between \\"Islam for Dummies\\" and whatever cartoon book is currently being handed out to American troops in Iraq...<br /><br />Even if you disagree with a book that exposes fundamentalist/radical Islam, including Shira law which allows for the oppression of women and wife-beating at the mere suspicion of straying from the \\"true path\\", this is an important text.  I urge Westerners concerned with the oncoming Islamo-fascist invasion (a term coined by Dr. Michael Savage and now in wide circulation) to read this work and take its admonitions seriously.<br /><br />If you want to understand the origins of 9/11, they go back to time of the Crusades, when Europe fought back Islam conquest which had reached France--not simply the unheeded warnings of the \\"Able Danger\\" spions in the Department of Defense who were aware of the specifics of Muhammand Atta's plans well prior to the end of the Clinton administration.

B000002LFU|4.0|REM is pretty much the exemplar and paradigm of American Underground rock.  They've pretty much gone the distance and stayed the course as far as rock bands are concerned, having been around for over eighteen years and are still releasing albums.  In this case Green is one of their earlier albums, but that hardly means it isn't worth listening to.  While many bands tend to experiment with disparet sounds and styles, as if they suffer from some sort of dissociative syndrome and can't connect with whom they really are, all of the songs on this album bear the distinctive stamp of REM's sound and style.  While the non - rock historian and the non - REM fan may find little of interest here, most fans will find this an enjoyable and entertaining performance.
0780020685|5.0|You don't often see a film that makes you want to stand up in your living room and start applauding.  SEVEN SAMURAI is, bar none, one of the greatest films I have ever seen.  From the film's captivating opening, to its in-depth character studies, from its magnificent battle sequences, to its emotional ending, this film is perfect from start to finish.  \\"Perfect\\" is not a word that I like to throw around that often, but SEVEN SAMURAI deserves it: what flaws there are in this picture are so massively outweighed by the film's achievements that they render them innocuous.<br /><br />What can one say about a film that has been commented on so thoroughly?  I will only bring up one theme in the film that peaked my interest.  While others have commented on the film's portrayal of duty versus love, I would like to mention the film's endorsement of some form of humanism, weak as it may be (particularly in a film that is supposed to be a period piece of 16th century Japan).  While I traditionally think of \\"samurai\\" films depicting traditional values, such as honor and just revenge, this film takes a detour from such themes.  We see the leader of the samurai turn his back on the villagers when they exact their just revenge on a captured bandit.  \\"He's a prisoner-of-war, he has begged for mercy, we can't kill him,\\" shouts the leader.  But his words, surprisingly modern, fall upon deaf ears.  We also see a classic \\"class\\" struggle in the film, when one of the samurai falls for the daughter of a peasant farmer.  While it may be just a subtle voice in the film, Kurosawa manages to weave it in amidst the traditional values, suggesting a departure from traditional ways and thinking.<br /><br />Two other things warrant mentioning.  First of all, the character development in this film is remarkable.  Don't get hung up on the subtitles: we all know how much is really communicated with body language anyway.  You won't have trouble following these characters, even with their complexity.  Kurosawa has not delivered us a story of a virtuous village, protected by virtuous samurai, who are brutally assaulted by vicious bandits.  There are few cardboard characters in SEVEN SAMURAI.  Instead, we have a village full of self-interested, greedy, and cowardly persons.  Some are kind, some are not.  Our samurai are not spotless either.  They, too, are searching for peace and their home.<br /><br />The second thing worth mentioning is Kurosawa's skill behind the lens: he really knows how to get his shot.  From his marvelous deep-focus shots, to his great sense of pacing (the battle sequence is one of the best \\"cut\\" shots I've ever seen).  Everything in the film is paced correctly leading up to the climax of the film.  The B&W is beautiful and this DVD transfer does it justice.<br /><br />If you haven't seen SEVEN SAMURAI, then you are truly missing something.  After watching this movie, you get the sense of how everything after this film had to respond to it in some way.  You'll never look at Westerns the same way again.  This is great storytelling, great characters, and great filmmaking all rolled into one.  Buy it today.  It is worth every penny.exity.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Along with most of the reviews you will find for this album, I gave this CD 5 stars because it hooks you no matter what genre you are most accustomed to.  I myself am a emo-kid type if you will, but I am enthralled with this CD.  It's been released for a couple of years now and I still play it with the frequency I did the day I bought it. Here's why you will love it...it blends the bands' influences together perfectly (punk, metal, glam-rock)..and it's not cheeze metal..it's true and emotional and crafty..not thrown together to be a radio hit.  Some of these songs are 10-minute \\"epics\\" like you used to get in the 70s-80s...only with a more \\"kick-assness\\" to it.  These guys can go from raw stand up and grrrrrrrrrr (Unholy Confessions) to powerful \\"ah! wow..!\\" lyrical beauty (I won't See You Tonight Pt.1).  I don't think any fan of serious musicianship can get bored with this CD.
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|If you think The Philadelphia Story is just a wonderfully sophisticated, perfectly written, perfectly performed comedy about an aloof and spoiled society girl (Hepburn), her likeable but alcoholic ex-husband (Grant), her newly acquainted admirer (Stewart), her philandering father and overly proper mother, her man-of-the-people fiance, and a host of other wonderful characters - you're mistaken. There's a message here, and it's just as wonderful as the writing, directing and acting.<br /><br />Tracy Lord (Hepburn) believes that Truth is everything, and she has sacrificed her marriage to C. K. Dexter Haven (Grant) to prove it. Various characters in the film compare her to a cold and unfeeling statue or a lofty goddess in a hilltop shrine. Her father, on the other hand, believes that Grace is everything, and proves it by having a notorious affair with a New York dancer. This difference causes the primary conflict in the film, and its need to be resolved is what gives the film its delightful situations.<br /><br />Enter C. K. Dexter Haven on the eve of his ex-wife's marriage, with writer Macauley Connor (Stewart) and photographer Elizabeth Imbrie (Hussey) in tow. They've been sent there  - blackmailed, really - by Spy Magazine editor Sidney Kidd (Daniell) to cover the event, and thereby keep him from printing a story on Tracy's father. Over the course of the weekend, Dexter adds the wise-cracks and insights that help Tracy figure out who she is and what she wants, and Macauley adds the catalyst to help her figure out who she isn't and what she doesn't want.<br /><br />Everyone sparkles in this film and every line is the epitome of wit and innuendo. Besides the three stars, standouts are Roland Young as Uncle Willie and Virginia Weidler as Tracy's younger sister, Dinah. In the end, Tracy finds the balance between Grace and Truth, her father is accepted back into the family (though he doesn't seem especially remorseful), Tracy accepts her ex-husband C. K. back, and Macauley and Miss Imbrie end up with whom they should - each other. All the way around, it's a fun, happy, witty film with a good message about balancing the seeming opposites of Grace and Truth.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithup with whom they should - each other.

B0009QBLA8|5.0|The earlier reviewer is right: Along with anything else one might say about Eraserhead, it is a loving homage to German Expressionism. One film in that style is \\"Der Testament Des Dr. Mabuse\\" by Fritz Lang (1933). The movie opens in a dark, cramped and cluttered basement, and a terrible, loud throbbing noise that shakes every object. It was never clear to me what caused the pulsing racket -- but I felt almost certain that it was the heartbeat of the terrified little man hiding behind a crate, waiting for his enemies. I was reminded immediately of Eraserhead.  <br /> <br />Periodically through Dr. Mabuse, characters are ushered into a barren room that has been stripped of all furnishings and plumbing; a curtain hangs along the back wall, and a dim light reveals the shadowy outline of a man. The characters refer to him only as \\"the man behind the curtain\\". That ominous shadow and name felt perfectly David Lynch!  <br /> <br />If you enjoyed Eraserhead, keep your eyes open for \\"Der Testament Des Dr. Mabuse\\" I wholeheartedly recommend it -- and don't be disappointed by the fairly rational resolution at the end -- it is still full of eerie atmosphere and creepiness that will delight any Lynch fan.
B000035P7X|5.0|Don't Look Back presents a portrait of an artist going through his adolescence about 10 years too late.  For those who have seen No Direction Home and want a more in-depth look at the tumultous Dylan personality of 1965-66 this is the place to look. <br /> <br />Pennebaker follows Dylan from stage to green room to hotel picking up on an increasingly isolated man seeking to continue his transformation from folk hero to pop star while being confronted with a public ready only for Donovan and a small fan base wanting only the issues-oriented troubadour they'd become comfortable with. <br /> <br />Dylan is depicted here being both tired and on edge at the same time.  Comedy comes in the form of Dylan's continued lambasting of Donovan (a running joke throughout the movie) and his confrontation or brushing-off of virtually every journalist assigned to cover him. <br /> <br />Performances are generally not shown in their entirety in the documentary itself.  But what performances are shown are remarkable for the fact that so many of the lyrics seem to be addressed to the fans who were not willing or were unable to follow Dylan into his blues/rock/pop phase: \\"Something's happening but you don't know what it is...\\", \\"I know that you know something's tearing up your mind...\\", Any lyric from Like a Rolling Stone. <br /> <br />Simply put, this documentary gives a great deal of insight on a man who wants to be accepted yet remain an outsider at the same time.  A man who wanted to be the center of the scene and pushing the boundaries of the scene at the same time.  It's truly an American story and the scenes of Dylan and the Hawks playing on a foreign stage in front of the American flag while playing blues and being booed is almost exhilirating.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan to begin with, but this movie just didn't do it for me.  Granted the viewer has to come into this movie with some prior knowledge of religion, but that aside this movie failed to entertain me.  Gavin Rosedale does a pretty good job in what I believe is his first major acting job.  Rachel Weis is solid as well.  My gripe about this movie is the story, not the actors.  You might find this entertaining, but I found it to be a waste of my time and money.
B000AXRTM4|4.0|I enjoyed William Boyd's previous novels - The Ice Cream War was particularly fun, and New Confessions was a great read. Any Human Heart is also an excellent book.  What will stay with me for a long time is the upbeat ending. It didn't have to be this way, given Logan's ups and downs and seemingly modest achievements. But the fact that it is gives us a happy-ending type feeling which I think is a real treat from Boyd and a real show of appreciation for life. <br /> <br />What dissapoints a bit is how similir the book is to New Confessions. That book has similar \\"ups and downs and modest achievements\\" over a similar scan of 20th century events and locations told by a similar main character.  Having read New Confessions (though quite some time ago) made Any Human Heart feel predictable.  Had a never read the former I may have well thought the latter a near-classic
B00005R1N3|4.0|I watched this for the first time late last night after reading all the glowing reviews. I wasn't disappointed but I was terrified! Afterwards I had to go to the bathroom at around 4am and this meant I had to pass the attic...  <br /> <br />The scares are genuine, and come psychologically, instead of in your face. It's more unnerving than it is frightening and the film is paced somewhat slowly. If you prefer horror films with alot of action, you best look somewhere else. Bob Clark is in love with his actors as he photographs them in bright exuberant colors, while his killer is photographed in jaundiced, grainy colors. In this regard it reminds me very much of Dario Argento's horror masterpiece \\"Suspiria\\". It's a beautiful looking film. The atmosphere is also second to none and the first person view from the killer only compliments this.  <br /> <br />There are moments where you have to suspend belief, I won't mention them as they are probable spoilers, but one I can is the cops didn't even think to check the attic out near the end. Or the rest of the house for that matter. They would inevitably have come back, but despite being certain they had the killer, they left a traumatised young woman on her own!  <br /> <br />The director himself later admitted he would have preferred to have dropped the open ending, and I would normally tend to agree. I usually hate open ended films and would much rather know the who, what and why. However, in this film it works. You will be left thinking about it for days and I imagine it will remain in your mind alot longer than if we knew everything.      <br /> <br />On a side note, I'm 22 now but I wish I was born in the 50s so I could have asked Olivia Hussey (Jessica Bradford) out! She looks stunning in this movie. <br /> <br />4.5 stars. <br /> <br />

You want TSOL's album Revenge, Fifteen's album Survivor, The Vice Dolls album Die Trying, or anything Social Distortion or Mike Ness.  Trust me.  This noise isn't worth the plastic discs it's encoded onto.

B0002S94OS|4.0|There's two great things about Lamb of God: there music isn't ridiculously complicated and whirls off in 20 different directions, and they're musicians are commited to what they do. Now that being said, they aren't perfect. This is the first band that I can say uses TOO MUCH DOUBLE BASS. 90% of the time I wouldn't say that to any band, but damn give your drummer a rest! <br /> <br />Anyway, if you like bands such as Slayer, Shadows Fall, Slipknot, etc., go ahead and buy this. It's goooood.
1580086810|5.0|The Hungry Planet, What the World Eats, by Peter Menzel and Faith D'Aluisio, is an excellent book.  I saw the photo exhibit at Copia in Napa in early 2005 and was taken by the wonderful photographs of families from around the world behind a table or blanket on the ground with their week's supply of food.  There was also an analysis of the food content and cost.  As one who studies the role of food in health and disease, I could see how what was on the table or blanket was related to the health of the family or, more generally, the entire country.  There was, for example, the portly Australian family with the mother who had suffered a stroke near age 50 years, sitting behind a table piled high with over 50 pounds of meat plus 4 gallons of dairy products, 4 gallons of sugar-laden drinks, etc., but very few \\"healthy\\" foods.  It was very easy to see why she was over weight and developed a stroke.  The Chinese village family, on the other hand, had only 20 pounds of meat but 47 pounds of fruit and over 50 pounds of vegetables, and they were much thinner.  The foreword by Marion Nestle, one of America's leading nutritionists, discussed the ills of overeating easily possible in today's world.  The photos, which go way beyond those seen at Copia, showing more about every day life in the cities and villages, and the text, explaining the role of food and agriculture, are excellent.  For the scientifically minded, there are data on health and food in the back of the book.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the role of food in health and disease and life.
1400032717|2.0|The book provided what appeared to me (someone with no special knowledge or experience with autism) to be a realistic portrait of the condition.  I did find the writing to be self-conscious in a distracting way:  we, as the readers, are so clearly meant to be taken on a journey led by the author.  In that way, I was annoyed by the book, because it seemed to be using the naive perspective of the lead character as almost a trick--hiding the ball from the reader.  Because of the perspective, the book is limited and cannot really speak to universal truths.  It is more like a parlor trick.  There is value in sharing the perspective of autism with the general population, and I don't mean to belittle that, but it's almost like this book wants to define autism for the reader and give pat insights into the experience of autism that can be used by the reader to feel like they have contained and comprehended what is certainly a complex and, in many ways, unfathomable condition.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|I saw Coldplay live this August at the Verizon Wireless Ampetheatre in Irvine, California. An avid concert-goer, I was eager to see how the definitive band for my generation would stand up to the hype live. Of course now with the bands' most recent CD, X&Y, there were new songs and changes to the concerts' line-up, but the pure musical genius I witnessed live was almost identical to that of the DVD.<br /><br />Some anal retentive types may find flaw in this interpretation of live performance. There are numerous camera angles, focus changes, and photography elements used to capture the raw energy and essence of Coldplays' live show. I for one thoroughly enjoy the non-linear approach taken by the director. Coldplay is such a creative and talented band, always paving the way and becoming innovators for the industry, why not mirror that in the approach to their DVD?  With such a plethora of color and sound, it's truely artistic and beautiful.<br /><br />The chosen playlist includes without a doubt some of the best tracks from their prior CDs, some of my personal favorites being 'In my place', 'clocks', 'shiver' and 'yellow'.<br /><br />The best concert dvd in my collection.<br /><br />Maybe before you rip apart the editing and direction you should listen to the music and take a hint from the band, and \\"open up your eyes.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes one straight shot, isn't all that interesting.

It kept my attention from beginning to end.
B000B0WODA|5.0|Anyone who tends to believe that Franz Ferdinand has entered a sophomore slump with their second record, is sorely mistaken. This record demonstrates the musical versitility of the band while still retaining aspects of their previous sound. Yes, this CD is filled with punk flavored dance rock, as was their first album; however, the songs on YCHHISMB are much different, much more musically advanced, yet they still have the Franz edge.  The fast powerful songs such as The Fallen, Evil and a Heathen, and This Boy refuse to let the listener sit down. I have found myself suddenly dancing for seemingly no reason.  The slower tracks such as Eleanor Put Your Boots On and What You Meant showcase the dynamics that were somewhat lacking on their first release.  Franz is clearly just getting started, and this album is just a slight example of what this amazing band is capable of.
B00000I8UE|4.0|It's difficult to peg this record into any particular genre.  \\"Jazz\\" might be the first category that comes to mind, but on this album, Cassandra Wilson taps into a lot of different musical styles.  Obviously, the main influence is Miles Davis.  Davis had himself covered Cyndi Lauper's \\"time after time\\" back in the 80s.  I'm not sure that was Davis's finest moment, but Wilson gives the song a sultry flavor here with her smoke filled voice.  The musicianship and recording clarity are spectacular, and the CD really shines on a great stereo.  Wilson is also heavily informed by candomble/santeria, which emerges throughout the disc.  Davis had also tapped into that magical Afro Brazilian rhythm, most famously on \\"Bitches Brew\\".  As someone else said in a review here, this record requires pretty close attention, but doing so will, with one or two exceptions, definitely reward the listener.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|I bought this set to see what I was going to get next week as I have tickets for Cream at Madison Square Garden.  Crossroads is disappointing but these guys are old -- they can't do that song as they did almost 40 years ago. <br />I'm glad there's a decent sound/video record of Cream now -- the \\"Farewell Concert\\" video sucked (I think it's being released on DVD soon but that's a waste of money).  I'll take this any day.
0380778556|5.0|This was my first du Maurier book and i read it because my mother recommended it. Initially, i found the book a little hard to get into. There were times when i wanted to grab the heroine and tell her to stop hiding- or to stop thinking of completely random things. However, as the book moved on i found that i was sat up, on the edge of my seat and that i simply couldn't put it down till the end. The last half of this book must simply be read in a night. Will Maxim get away with it? Everytime we think he has- another obstacle is hurled at us and we grip the book in frightened anticiaption. If you liked the Bronte sisters then this book is certainly for you- it's dark and has that same brilliant atmosphere of Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. It's long, but well worth the ending.
B000063UR2|3.0|Or maybe Tom Cruise just chalks this one up to a foot in the door.  Somehow I doubt it, since he had already blown through the Hollywood door with the seminal \\"Risky Business\\" three years before. <br /> <br />Legend is beautifully shot.  If there had been no dialogue, this film would have earned all its stars from me.  The filtering, soft lighting, and incredible visual composition of the goodness and magic of the forest creatures, supernatural and otherwise and it's amazing contrast with the glossy grotesqueness of the realm of darkness, the imposing \\"Great Tree,\\" and Tim Curry's unforgettable black bull horns and red lucifer-on-steroids body... these images are unforgettable and seem to tap into a universal consciousness on their own visual power. <br /> <br /> <br />However, watching this film, one could be persuaded (a trick of Satan himself?) that the only intelligent being in the cosmos is the Lord of Darkness, although even his intelligence is suspect after he tells the audience and all who will listen, in a magnificent, powerful, and booming voice, exactly what will render him powerless. <br /> <br />Dialogue is trite.  While it can be appreciated that this film is endearing (love conquers all but innocence is fleeting), movies are nothing if not a complete art form.  Acting, visuals effects, music, all of the arts combine, and it is frustrating that so many are willing to forgive so much for such a one-sided work. <br /> <br />The visuals are stunning, but the story, dialogue, and music just  plain suck. <br /> <br />The story is recycled - yes, it's a legend, the archetypes abound and are supposed to, every story is recycled, blah, blah, blah - but it's such a gaping hole that only the Lord of Darkness has any complexity to him. <br /> <br />The dialogue vacillates between fantastical nobility and banal modern colloquialisms and sometimes it's like the characters aren't even listening to each other or talking about the same thing. <br /> <br />The music isbetter this time around, though I must admit I felt a twinge when I didn't hear Jon Anderson's voice soaring over the final montage.  Better without, though.  Tangerine Dream is cool and new agey, but not appropriate for an archetypal legend, however atmospheric and fantastical their name may be. <br /> <br />Frankly, the only things that keep this film's head above the sludge in the miasmic swamp of cult B-filmdom (which is not to say I wouldn't see it, I LOVE a good corny cult-classic) are Ridley Scott's name and damn good production design and DOP.  It is a pretty film with an impressive and commanding performance by a significantly make-upped Tim Curry.  The archetypes of this film strike a deep chord of Jungian universal consciousness while somehow avoiding any semblance of humanity from all but the Devil.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|This was the movie that introduced me to Westerns, and I couldn't have started with a better one. Clint Eastwood is perfect as the \\"man with no name,\\" a.k.a. \\"Blondie.\\" The barren and sometimes colorful landscapes are filmed in a beautiful and unusual way, and they really give this movie depth. And the close-ups of gun holsters, faces, etc. have since become trademarks of the Western genre. <br /> <br />Clint is a \\"good\\" guy who pretty much makes his living by capturing \\"the ugly\\" Eli Wallach, turning him in for rewards, and saving him from the noose. Soon, though, both learn of a buried treasure, but each only knows part of its location. So, they are forced to continue working together, while Lee van Cleef, the \\"bad\\" one, also trails them. <br /> <br />The funny thing to me was, Clint Eastwood's character was the good guy, yet he seemed to kill far more people than the other two. But it is a near-perfect picture, really. There are dozens of memorable scenes, like the dynamite, the final showdown, and Clint's trek without water. This is my favorite Western of all time, and I have seen quite a few. It is rather long, but I didn't notice that; I was caught up in the story and action the whole time. The camera work and gritty dialogue remain my favorite aspects of TGTBTU. I recommend this to anyone - yes, anyone. That's all for me.
B000002N2N|5.0|This was once a two-LP set, but of course the Ramones being the hyperspeed lunatics they were, the full 28-song set fits on a single CD with room to spare.  This is the best live Ramones album - indeed, it's probably the best Ramones album, period.  It's also the best live album ever by a punk band, in my opinion.  With the exception of the somewhat tender \\"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow\\" the boys hit the ground sprinting, roaring into \\"Rockaway Beach\\" like tasmanian devils on methamphetamine ... and do not let up for the next hour or so.<br /><br />The sound is excellent, and the live format really brings out the best in these guys - as high-energy as their studio work was, it was in front of a bunch of screaming fans that the Ramones were truly in their element.  The band is razor-sharp, with hardly a moment to breathe (or for Dee-Dee to holler \\"One-Two-Three-Four!!!) between the songs - songs that generally clock in just under two minutes apiece.<br /><br />The only thing that always bugged me about this album was the fact that it doesn't have \\"Locket Love\\" (which might not have been written yet) and \\"Swallow My Pride\\" (which was a single in a few European countries, and really should have been included in their set).  However, that's not enough to keep this monumental recording from earning 5 stars.<br /><br />For ten bucks, how can you resist?
B00008OLYN|5.0|So.. Wasn't sure about buying this album 'cause people say it sucks? That it is not METAL? Well, that's correct. There's no single scream by Mikael or even a heavy guitar.

Let's just cut the crap and ask THE question about you liking this CD or not.  <br /> <br /> <br />Like heavy stuff, uh? That's all? All you care about is headbangin' and wearing black t-shirts? If yes, then don't even listen do this CD. BUT. If you like Opeth brutality AND some dark, beautiful, atmospheric, clean and cool music, like Anathema, for instance, then, yes, buy this CD. <br /> <br /> <br />I assure you. You won't be disappointed.

His combination of humor, science, and short, unrelated stories makes this book timeless (and perfect to keep in the bathroom)! Since writing my first review, I have suggested and gifted this book to people in every stage of life. My favorite is to give it to preteens/teens who are too smart for their own good and would benefit from some slightly rebellious, but very very 'smart' literature. The passion it can ignite is palpable.
0307276902|4.0|In the words of author James Frey: \\"I am an Alcoholic and I am a drug Addict and I am a Criminal. That is what I am and who I am and that is how I should be remembered. No happy lies, no invented memories, no fake sentimentality, no tears.\\"<br /><br />The above quotation from \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" perfectly describes both the author and the content of this book, which is the story of one man's journey down the road to recovery. Presented without sentimentality, limited punctuation and straightforward arrogance, it paints a vivid picture of bottom-of-the-barrel addiction. Reading it made me woozy. I felt both intoxicated and sick to my stomach. I felt his pain, agony, fear, hunger, Fury, irreverence, self-loathing and, most poignantly, his strength.<br /><br />If you know nothing about addiction, this will help you understand where and how it begins. As the author recounts his Family sessions at the clinic, you can BE the parent hearing terrible things your child admits to you--things you may have suspected, but never knew were happening. Some of us know alcoholics and addicts and know that the likely outcomes of this behavior are either prison or death. For the fortunate, there's rehab and for the few (the 17% who, according to the clinic counselors portrayed in this book, stay sober for a year after they leave) recovery. Bucking the system--refusing to accept God or a Higher Power, deriding the Twelve Steps, refusing advice on (nearly) everything with a youthful and odious irreverence, James Frey adds an entirely personal and educational dimension to the topic. He tries to make the reader understand that alcoholism/addiction is an equal-opportunity disease (although he may argue that it's not a disease) and recovery is completely up to the individual. In spite of his despicable nature, we root for him. We can't help but wish him and every character in this story well.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|The goal of this version of Dare Devil was to give the fans a look at the grittier side of the picture, giving the film a somewhat darker direction. In so doing, the director included footage that make the characters a bit more grandiose and exagerated, much like the bad guys in The Crow. But that wasn't all. Some secens were changed to make our hero more of the guy who just can't seem to get a break. This version has a different flavor and pacing to it than the original theatrical one, but those differences don't diminish the viewing experience. Personally I prefered the theatrical version over the director's cut, but when taken together the two movies complement each other quite well, leaving you with the feeling that \\"now\\" you have seen the whole story.
0792846443|5.0|I have always felt the underappreciated film, \\"Misery\\", from King's novel of the same name, was akin to some of the best of his films (and so many of the films made from his novels are drek!). I do think that the film would have profited from a better actor in the lead role of Paul Sheldon (Nicholson is said to have turned it down....DeNiro would have been a great choice, but my personal favorite was Kevin Kline, who also turned it down), but the casting of James Caan just gave us more ability to focus on Kathy Bates, a journeyman actress who had been in at least a dozen films before Misery launched her career. And Caan turns in a worthy performance.<br /><br />King puts a modern day twist on the same kind of captivity and obsession that Fowles dealt with in his book, \\"The Collector\\".  The title of this movie and also King's book is ironic.  Misery, of course, is the name of the popular character in the Paul Sheldon (James Caan) series of books; he's a successful novelist with a romantic heroine he's grown tired of (Misery Chastain) and is killing off in his newest book, as yet unpublished (sort of like Patricia Cornwell with Kay Scarpetta...and while PC hasn't killed KS yet, one hopes she will, and soon) And misery (without the capital M) is exactly what he gets for having encountered Annie Wilkes, a psychopath immortalized by Bates. Injured and alone, Sheldon is made a virtual prisoner by his \\"number one fan\\".<br /><br />The audience is uneasy....if Hitchcock had directed, the uneasiness would have grown into fear a lot sooner, but Reiner, a good director that's a little out of his genre here, invokes realism instead of symbolism to point to all the signs of an impending Annie breakdown. Even those who had not read the novel will be hit over the head by the clues Annie leaves to what will happen when she finishes his new book. It's the one element of the film that prevents it, in my opinion, from being truly great. There's a background story going on about the sheriff, his wife and Sheldon's publicist trying to find him. It's well kept in the background and necessary to inject realism into what is happening to Paul.<br /><br />How Annie and Paul revenge themselves on each other is something you will recoil from, as you watch the film.<br /><br />Bates is stunning in her role, won every award in filmmaking for it, and has gone on to be our most memorable character actress. Reiner and Caan (especially Caan, who resuscitated his post-Godfather career with this) also contributed heavily to the very real life tragedy of the stalking/obsessive phenomena that famous people sometimes have to live with. There are also a lot of bloopers in the film, most of which I think Reiner left in as sort of a signpost to see who would pick up on them. My favorite Reiner-ism is the video of \\"Harry Met Sally\\"...a Reiner film that is clearly visible on one of Annie's trips to the local store.<br /><br />And the film is chock full of memorable quotes, that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.  I leave you with one, from Bates as Annie, at the height of her madness:<br /><br />\\"Oh, This whole house is going to be full of romance, OOOH, I am going to put on my Liberace records.\\"<br /><br />Add it to your collection, it's a memorable thriller.e sheriff, his wife and Sheldon's publicist trying to find him.

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I'll just get this out of the way with a wink and a smile: Final Fantasy VII is overrated. I'm sure when it came out, people saw it as an innovation in storytelling and the use of 3D in RPGs. But if you've been playing games since then and have just now picked it up, only to arrive at the conclusion that FFVII is STILL the best game ever made....you're just jumping on the bandwagon. I've beaten the game, and that's my opinion.<br /><br />Anywho, super cool movie. The plot is not that difficult to follow, but if you've ever seen The Spirits Within, you'll most likely know what it feels like to zone out during a scene. e.g. the drab colors and constant repetitive motion of battles is sometimes just a real eyesore. Don't get me wrong, I got the bubblies when I saw the first motorcycle fight sequence, but the third and the fourth and the fifth(where they end up at the Shinra Building) were just killer on my attention span. On the other hand, some fight scenes gave me the bubblies just like the first. Of course, those were the ones that had actual meaning, as in when the whole cast reunites to gang on a particular baddie.<br /><br />Speaking of meaning: the plot. The plot was pretty good. I think I really enjoyed sitting through this movie more than sitting through that game. So at this point, I have nothing against either. (SPOILER) The parts where the children are being abducted and drinking the Jenova stuff, then they stand in a circle around the statue in Midgar....what was the point of that? Nothing happened to them at all, and they certainly weren't some sort of threat to the cast. There was no conflict! No conflict in that, I tell you! (END SPOILER) It was basically as dry as Spirits Within, but I suspect it was really the characters who drew me in more than the plot.<br /><br />Ah, the characters. Cloud is antisocial as ever, still feeling embittered by Aeris' death, and even moreso when rumors of Sephiroth's second coming are abound. (See there? THAT makes more sense now.) Aeris, surprisingly enough, is a major character in the movie, since she manifests herself as a physical healing aspect(that I won't spoil). Finally, a few surprise defections and a cast full of our faves from the game later, everything is looking pretty peachy.<br /><br />Finally, the animation. Hooooooly crap, everyone flies! There are some really cool scenes, and I mean some REALLY cool scenes in which this whole ignorance of gravity really makes the action on screen more exciting. On the other hand, in the action sequences that just don't matter, it's still used, which makes it just a little too casual for future scenes. Am I confusing you with this? I guess you'll just have to see.<br /><br />Finally, the end of the movie and the credits were pretty satisfying. Keep watching after the white-on-black credits because there's an easter egg or two you'll enjoy. I plan to buy the North American release, even though I've just seen it in Jap with English subtitles, because I want to hear the voices and see some DVD extras. Also, it's good to support S-E for their work on this project and not just steal it for kicks.s more sense now.)

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed some of the episodes and I really liked the series.  It was great to be able to see the whole series plus some of the episodes that never aired.  I was very excited to hear that the selling of the dvds caused a film to be made.  I watched them just before I saw the movie and they gave great background material to enjoy the movie more.  I am watching them again. It is something a little different.  I like westerns and science fiction and this gives me both.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Finally, someone got it right. Batman is not a kids character as Schumacher reduced him to. Instead he is a menacing, tormented soul, who in contradiction to a previous review, resides in the real world. Batman IS the only real world hero. No super powers, no roots on another planet. This is a rich guy, that experienced some horrible things as a child, discovered he had the means to prevent this type of thing from happening in the future, and did something about it. The way the weapons were created by hand, and the functions of the cape explained made it all the more possible, if not probable, that this could happen. The small touches such as the summoning of the bats using the frequency emitter was a fantastic touch. Simply because you realize that to the public, this cannot be a mortal man, but you as the viewer, having been exposed to his secrets, realize he is all to human. This is by far, the best Batman movie to date. My only hope is the sun does not rise of this title and begin to lighten it. Keep it dark and threatening. A Batman movie should be rated 'R'. People should get hurt and killed. The comic book never held any punches, neither should these films. This is the 1st movie I have ever attended where the entire audience stood and applauded at end. Bravo gentlemen, bravo.
B00016ZQZW|4.0|This is Queen's official last studio album but it's really all about Freddie Mercury.  Very introspective and reflective of all aspects of life from womb to the tomb and the hereafter.  Given the background behind this what with Freddie already knowing that he was at death's door, this very un-Queen like album is really quite good.  All the songs except perhaps \\"I Was Born To Love You\\" are of the slow, moody, sentimental variety.  This Japanese mini-lp sleeve version is very good though as it has been recently remastered and the overall design of the package is very good.  This is a must for any Queen fan but for the uninitiated, this may give you a wrong idea about what Queen's life's work was all about.  This whole album is about Freddie writing for himself and who can blame him?
0060751967|5.0|I am currently in the middle of this book but so far I love it.  I love the humor and the characters.  There is nothing I love better than a book that can make me laugh out loud and this one does.  This is the first book by this author that I have read and I will read more.
0385486804|2.0|While the story of McCandless is semi-interesting, there doesn't appear to be enough material for a book.  The author attempts to flesh out the story through long quotations, his personal stories, stories of others, and information about McCandless from people who could not have known him well.  Curiously, Krakauer refers often to the photos McCandless took of his surroundings and himself, but only offered one in the book.   <br /> <br />For my two cents, I think Chris McCandless has some mental problems.  He was charismatic and charming with strangers, but had no friends or family that he kept in contact with that he had known for more than two years.  He knew that he would quite possibly die in Alaska, and he did. Was he an explorer, a free spirit, a silly young man, an incompetent egotist?  In the end I didn't really care that much.  It's a sad story and I hope at least that it will serve as a warning for the foolhardy.  Otherwise it would have been better to leave the story alone, let the family get over their grief, and not subject readers to such round-about writing.
0446677450|4.0|I enjoyed this book mainly because growning up my dad was exactly like the poor dad in this book (PhD, obsessed with a secure job) and gave me the same \\"bad\\" advice that Kiyosaki's poor dad gave him.  So, if you're a novice when it comes to finance like I am, this book will likely turn some ideas you have about money on their head.  The main one is that becoming educated and finding a secure job is simply not enough if you want to become wealthy.  I'm sure this is obvious to many people, but it was news to me.   <br /> <br />The book is extremely non-specific, so you will only really be able to get concepts, not real world know-how. It becomes clear fairly early on that this is not a how-to book.  Kiyosaki gives barely any specific examples of how he made his millions, and the ones he does give are anecdotes, meant to illustrate a concept more than show a finacial tactic.  As I read through it, I found myself often thinking \\"I'm going to have to look into this...\\", as the author only points you toward ideas you may not have heard, leaving it to you to investigate.   <br /> <br />I like the author after reading the book, but it should also be noted that he is a terrible writer.  He actually admits this about midway through the book in one of his acedotes.  The book is written at around the 5th grade level, so it won't take you more than a couple of hours to finish.   <br /> <br />If you're curious about money making, this book is a good place to start.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Some people may choose to pan this album because of the raw sounding Cash, but the fact is that's what makes it so great. The entire CD is Cash throwing open the doors to his soul. Maybe it's too much for some people to bare witness to, but for every other member of the human race it's a moving testimonial to the life of great artist and a complex man. There are many great albums out there, but very few true masterpieces. This is definately one of them, if not THE one.
0140177396|5.0|John Steinbeck tells this timeless story, entitled Of Mice and Men, of two fiends who are going from one farming job to another. One of the main characters, Lennie, is mentally retarded and is taken car of by George, the other main character. The two can't keep a job, because of Lennie's illness. He doesn't know how strong he is, and he's very strong, so when he gets mad he inflicts pain upon others, without meaning to. In the climax of the book, Lennie does something that is unchangeable, unwonted, and unforgivable. Steinbeck leaves you off with a jaw-dropping, tear jerking ending. <br />The descriptive writing, the shocking ending, and the wonderful characters have you on the edge of your seat until the end.
B00000IQW3|4.0|This movie is an early CGI classic.  Sure not quite as groundbreaking as Tron but still a great movie.  Plot's a bit cheesy but it's still a fun movie.  And if you're a CGI fan it's a must have.
1573301183|5.0|What you see when you play this DVD is the last show performed by the mighty Alice in Chains, to a select audience way back in the mid-90s following the release of the eponymous album, the one with the three-legged dog on the cover, fondly referred to as Tripod. <br /> <br />I bought the unplugged CD the day it was released in the latter half of 1996 and was already a fan by the time Tripod came out in 1995. It was not the best time to be an AiC fan, though - rumours were rife about the state of the band, Layne Staley's very public drug addiction was center-stage and things were not really looking up. Shortly after this CD came out, another tour was cancelled and the band went on a long hiatus. Staley died in April 2002; I bought this DVD in October of that same year. <br /> <br />I never got to see Alice live; I never will. I cannot help but feel sad and angry and even cheated to a point when I watch the concert - hindsight being 20-20, I guess you can probably see there and then that it is all over. As a fan, it isn't an easy concert to watch. In fact, even the first time I watched it, it wasn't easy. <br /> <br />All that aside, the music is phenomenal. I'm not sure that it all fits the format very well - there are 4 tracks from Tripod on the album, and at least one of them, Sludge Factory, doesn't really work unplugged, in my opinion. I'll admit I was surprised when I heard Alice had done an Unplugged, because a lot of their material is very heavy and layered-up on the albums and the single acoustic guitar wouldn't do any favours unplugged, I thought. <br /> <br />Other heavy tracks make the transition perfectly, though, and are given a fresh look and sound for the show. In particular, Down in a Hole shines out in this format, its usual dirginess (is that a word?) brightened considerably and the trademark vocal harmony of Layne and guitar god Jerry Cantrell soars cleanly over the top. Other favourites include Rooster and Angry Chair (also heavy; working surprisingly well unplugged) from Dirt, as well as the two quieter selections from Sap - Brother and Got me Wrong - which both sound truly inspirational. I challenge anyone to find a better intro to any song on any Unplugged album than the one for Got me Wrong. <br /> <br />For openers, there is crowd-favourite Nutshell, a haunting rendition of this beautiful track, and closing out the set is a new track which never saw daylight, I don't think, called The Killer is Me. There are a couple of others as well making a total of 13 tracks. <br /> <br />Layne is very quiet and withdrawn until he sings, but the bulk of the interaction with the audience comes from Cantrell, who is in fine form cracking jokes and chatting and laughing. I get the impression, though, that Alice as a band is a little wary of the Unplugged format. Their Live album, strung together from shows in the early 90s, captures the essence of Alice a little better, I think. <br /> <br />Still, it was a great show, a magnificent swansong from a band who continued to be relevant throughout its career.
B00005OCMR|5.0|What can you say...this movie is part of the CGI bible.  Truly groundbreaking in CGI.  It's funny, the plot's good and it really showed the way of the future in CG based effects.

0312330537|5.0|This is the story of a 'Gangster Gandhi'. Nonjudgemental, compassionate, yet making no attempt to hide the dysfunctional thought process of the protagonist, it tells about an escaped convict on the run. Lin arrives on a fake passport to Mumbai and falls in love with the place. When he runs out of money he moves to the slum, adjusting to the harsh life with a positive spirit that reminds you of Francie in A Tree grows in Brooklyn. Ten years of his life flood the 900 plus pages with a cast of characters that include village dacoits, pimps, passport forgers, palestinian fighters,Iranian army deserters, brothel madams with a KBG past. There is Prabhakar whose smile will stay with you after your book is done, Didier, the aging gay man who could have inspired Eliot to write The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, the loveless Karla with a neglected childhood, the Palestinian who burns with hate, and countless other underworld characters who indulge in philosophy as an intellectual defense for their dark deeds. <br /> <br />This book falls short of a classic, partly because at times it spends too much time glorifying the underworld. Lin's life in crime really begins in Bombay, after his supposed spiritual rebirth working in a slum as a medic, something thats not well understood. For a fleeting moment you may wonder- has Lin has really reformed, or is this book a con job of a different kind, with a pen ? But things fall into place in the end. Unlike Captain Corelli's Mandolin, this is not a feel good book with sweet pure characters either (Prabhakar being the exception). At times you hate the protagonist himself for his actions, his gradual entry into crime. Yet its all out there, in the face. This is a story of survivors in a tough city, and Lin baba is the ultimate survivor of all.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Green Day was one of the first of the terrible pop punk bands to use the vocal sound of a mix of having a fake english accent while trying to speak perfectly and  plugging their nose at the same time. <br /> <br />If thats your thing you will like it because that style is used here again, but to me it's just the same typical crap.
B000002J03|5.0|In the end of 1969, rock'n roll fan saw the turning point of the music history, Led Zeppelin II is on the top of the chart in both of UK and US dragging out Beatles' Abbey Road. <br /> <br />Nowadays most of the fan pick the first album rather than the second. The second album includes some impressive unforgettable numbers but still less impressive in total than other their great albums. <br />However it is still worth to spare time to listen several times. <br /> <br />My favorite numbers in the second are: <br />The Lemon Song, the first part has impressive base line, <br />Heartbreaker, Simple and impressive Page's guitar gig, <br />Ramble on, it shows somehow later Led Zeppelin's character, combination of folk song and heavy rock, <br />and, Moby Dick, just say Bonham Great! <br /> <br />The album also includes the second theme song of Zeppelin, the first is of course Stairway's, Whole Lotta Love, but this number never touches my feeling. <br /> <br />This album is recorded during their US tour so there is some American sound influence, such as \\"Bring It On Home\\" is typical. And that is why the album less impress me.  <br />Led Zeppelin is from U.K. and definitely they are the European band. I think that charms me and various people too. <br />

I am not going to lie, before I stumbled across this album in stores, I did not even know who this Eric Clapton guy was, but he must be an up and coming star!  Who else could create such great remakes of songs from the 70's.  I have heard these songs before, but Clapton does a great job of adding a little new flavor to all of the songs.

B000AA305M|1.0|David Gray, being one of my very favorite artists ever, finally comes along with some new and wonderful material and it is, sadly, in this abusive (to the honest consumer) copy-protected format.  I have paid so much money over the years for the huge number of CDs I own (legally) and I bet, in that respect, that I represent a majority of music fans: we're honest and we're willing to pay for our music.  Owning it should include the right to use it freely on our PCs, Macs, iPods, and anything else for the rest of our lives.  Oh yeah, and without infecting our computers with stealthy sabotage software.    When I understand how little money the artists actually earn from album sales, I realize that this fight over copyright is entirely about the pocket-lining of parasitic A&R people and all the no-talent scum that control the industry (like the very people who blew off David Gray earlier in his career because one of his albums didn't meet \\"sales expectations\\").      I hope this most recent move is the beginning of the end for the music industry as we've known it.  I'm cutting them off just like I did with Microsoft when they started treating me like a pirate even though I own everything of theirs that I've ever used.  (Three cheers for Newton's third law bringing us the Open Source movement!)    Someday I hope that all artists operate their own web sites and we can somehow buy direct from them.  Let's cut the dirt out of the loop.  We've seen enough on how the record companies feel about us and about the artists.  For my money, they add NOTHING OF VALUE to the equation.    Music: 5 stars  CD: 1 Star  Record company execs: Lower than dirt.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is one of the greatest scifi TV shows of the modern TV era. I wish Fox would watch some of the shows they air before they pull them, seriously how could you not love this show. It's got \\"cowboys\\", bad guys, space ships, intense action scenes, beautiful women (and men?). The dialogue is well written and guarantees a couple of good rolling belly laughs per show. This is the height of good television, I am so glad the DVD set and movie were both produced. I can only hope a channel like SciFi will pick this up and run with it, similar to the Stargate SG-1 and SG:Atlantis series. This was one of those shows that us tivo-free people ran to the bathroom and back during commercials for. Thank You Joss Whedon.
B00000253N|5.0|When I was a kid, I only knew Bob Dylan from his top 40 stuff.  \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\",  \\"Everybody Must Get Stoned\\", \\"Serve Somebody\\", \\"Lay, Lady Lay\\", and I could never figure out what the big deal was.  (You think I could at least have appreciated the wide variety).  Flash forward to middle age.  I rediscover my own love for the guitar, and enter the local open mic circuit.  Time after time, when I ask a fellow bard \\"Whose wonderful, magical song is that?\\" the answer is, \\"Oh!  That's Dylan.\\"  (Actually, the most frequent answer is, \\"Oh!  That's Leadbelly,\\" but that's another review.)<br /><br />I can't remember what inspired me to make Blood on the Tracks on of my first Dylan choices; maybe because \\"Shelter from the Storm\\" was a song I knew I did like from his \\"popular\\" catalogue.  But these lilting melodies, in many cases quite simple (\\"You're Going to Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\"), but always beautifully crafted, and the witty lyricism keep this CD perennially on my changer.<br /><br />\\"Blood on the Tracks\\" was written during a very difficult time, as his marriage was disintegrating (his divorce did not occur till 1977, while BOT was released in late 1974)..  Much of the CD focuses on relationship and their endings.  \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" starts from the beginning.  \\"Simple Twist of  Fate\\" tells of the emptiness felt after a one-night-stand.<br /><br />\\"You're a Big Girl Now\\" might be the first song to refer to an ended relationship..  The protagonist is saying goodbye to someone, reassuring himself more than her as she boards a plane that she can take care of herself on her own.  He's accepted the separation, although there's one plaintive cry in the middle:  \\"I can change, I swear\\",  which resolves: \\" I can make it through, You can make it too.\\"<br /><br />Sure, there is anger. (\\"Idiot Wind\\").  Sure, there is pain.  But the human spirit triumphs in these songs, as well.<br /><br />My personal favorite is \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go.\\" Once again, the protagonist has accepted his love's decision to leave, and perhaps he also has pulled away some.  But he still is able to sing her praises, and to know part of what they had will go with him: \\"But I'll see you in the sky above, In the tall grass, in the ones I love\\"<br /><br />I've heard that Mozart was writing his tender, uplifting aria \\"Ruhe sanft, mein holdes Leben\\" (K 336b), after he had just been unceremoniously dumped by the love of his life, Aloysia Weber.  Who knows if history will be as kind to Robert Zimmerman as to Wolfgang Mozart, but at least they have these things in common:  people have gone around whistling their tunes in the streets during their lifetimes, and they were able to write hopefulness even during a time of pain.<br /><br />(And trivia fans:  the song over which Hootie and the Blowfish were sued after using its lyrics is on this cd.<br /><br />Ain't Bobby so cool?)Once again, the protagonist has accepted his love's decision to leave, and perhaps he also has pulled away some.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This is the only Nightwish album I own at this stage, but based on this one and seeing them live in Melbourne earlier this year I'll definitely be getting more from their back catalogue.<br /><br />Nightwish combine Rammstein-ish guitar, powerfull drumming,  keyboards/piano, orchestral arrangements, growlish & harsh vocals from bass player Marco Hietala, but the angelic sweetness of Tarja Turunens' voice is definitely the crucial ingredient that makes this band and album stand out.<br /><br />Once is a brilliant album.  It combines aggression with subtelty, power with melody, and top notch playing and production.  It is now wonder that this album has acheived such high sales figures in Europe, it has an appeal to it for listeners of all kinds of music.  The heavy pounding metal is blended masterfully with the operatic voice and orchestral arrangements, and the songs themselves are great.  My favorites include \\"dark chest of wonders\\", \\"wish I had an angel\\", \\"Nemo\\", \\"planet hell\\", \\"the siren\\" the epic \\"ghost love score\\" and the beautiful \\"kuolema tekee taiteilijan\\" (sung entirely in Finish!).  The two bonus tracks \\"white night fantasy\\" and \\"live to tell the tale\\" are also very good songs which could easily have been included as regular album tracks.<br /><br />If I have to be critical of this album at all I would say that in the middle there are two tracks that are a bit weaker than the rest, those being \\"dead gardens\\" and \\"romanticide\\", however they are well placed on the album and some excellent songs follow them to finish the album, so they do not detract from the album as a listen as a whole.  However, this is a minor criticism as the album is simply brilliant and I thuroughly recommend it.<br /><br />I was wondering how Nightwish would sound live and feared that they might be a bit of a let down in the flesh, but this was not the case.  They were fantastic!  The whole place was rocking and everyone was wanting more.  Tarja seemed a bit emotional at the end when the crowd just went off with applause for their show.  I hope they tour Australia with their next album, I'll definitely be there.end when the crowd just went off with applause for their show.

0451529308|4.0|I have a very special place in my heart for this book, & not only because I really learned to LOVE reading as I enjoyed this book for the first time, but also because of its characters & heart-warming story. It truly is a coming of age tale of the March sisters & their unbreakable bond through all of the tough times that life places before us.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, this book was very relateable with situations that many of us as readers have encountered. For me, it was very nice to see such a close-knit family who loves each other so much, as opposed to the broken family homes turning up in novels so often today. (And don't get me wrong, I know how important it is to portray the 'broken' homes too-I come from one myself.)Another reason why I loved this book was because of the warm & endearing bond that the March sisters shared. I never had a sister & having the chance to peek into such a relationship between  these sisters was very much so enjoyable for me. <br /> <br />This novel is well-written & has obviously withstood the test of time for it is just as well-loved now as it was five, ten, or twenty years ago! <br /> <br /> <br />

0441003257|5.0|This is the only book by Gaiman that I have read, but it has left me wanting to read more.  It is certainly the funniest book I have ever read.  Good Omens gives a unique perspective on the conflict between Heaven and Hell, the interactions between the underlings of each, and the place of humanity in between.  The movie Dogma is comparable, though I feel Good Omens is funnier and a little less irritating in presentation.  Not that I didn't like Dogma.  If you like one you will probably like the other.    Good Omens follows the not-so-evil Anti-Christ as he is misplaced at birth and raised normally in rural England.  He and his friends somewhat parallel the Four Riders of the Apocolypse, who have been living on earth and causing trouble for humans since the beginning of time.  My favorite characters however, are an incompetent angel and demon who are friends with each other.  They like humans, have problems with the beaurocracies of Heaven and Hell, and would prefer that the apocolypse never happen so that they won't have to go home.    The characters are all interesting and humorous, demon, angel, human, or otherwise.  The stroyline is good, and avoids falling into the 'same old thing' of apocolypse stories.

B00006RINF|5.0|I heard of this band from a co worker and decided to pick it up. I have word to say, AMAZING. Im not normally one for female singers in a hard rock band( not that i think they shouldnt be), but Christina's voice absolutely blew me away. Swamped is a excellent song and a good choice to start off a terrific album. I recommend this to all my friends when they mention Evanescence, I tell them that it is Italy's versionm and damn good one at that. There are a few songs that i didnt care for, but artists are not perfect and making perfect albums is not what its about... I listen to this album every chance i get.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|I haven't seen the DVD but I do remember watching this on TV. <br />I remember that it scared me very much. I was 30 when I saw it and for days after I involuntarily looked up at the sky for no apparent reason other than fear that I would see streaks across the sky that I couldn't identify. I do believe that it's too late now for complete nuclear disarmament because there are too many \\"crazies\\" in this world and to disarm would be an invitation we can not afford. However, I do hope we never have to use ours because they don't really want to use thiers. I hope. I'm a fan of horror movies in which people are stalked by monsters, zombie, aliens, etc. These movies may provide a chill and a thrill but they are nothing compared to the chill I get when I think of what we can do to each other. Zombies? That's nothing compared to crazies with nuclear weapons.
0385493800|5.0|There are very few novels which are fun to read, educational and thought provoking all at the same time.   I have no idea how many books I have read in my lifetime, but having been an avid reader for over 35 years now the number is well into the hundreds if not topping 1,000.  Only a few dozen of the novels I've read in those years have left a lasting impression, and The Testament is one of those.   <br /> <br />While the plot line is a sort of legal mystery, the message is one of the power of redemption and the corrosive influence money and can wield. <br /> <br />Take the time to read and ponder, it is well worth your effort.

B000AARKOO|4.0|When did Balian learn how to defend a city?  <br /> <br />This is the question I walked out of the theater with. I can come up with \\"justification\\" explanations but did anyone see something I missed?  <br /> <br />I have waited for many, many years for a modern epic film about the Crusades.  <br />Here it is and I still am trying to figure out why it doesn't satisfy. I had the same problem with \\"Troy\\" but that was easy to figure out.  <br />What I loved the most were the visual images. When I was a boy in the fifties and got my first library card I spent many hours in the art section looking at collections of classic paintings of historical events, mostly battles. There were moments in the film that took my breath away. Anyone else remember those paintings of massed armies with forests of spears at the ready?  <br />The lines of armored knights marching to battle.  <br />The sight of the army marching behind the cross.  <br />The two armies locked in heaving, claustrophobic deadlock in the breach of the city wall.  <br />Superb.  <br /> <br />The other thing I walked out of the theater with was a desire to see the story of Godfrey and his knights and what they went through to get to the point where they entered the story. Why do I think this would have made a better movie? Could it really be because of the difference in film presence between Neeson and Bloom? Imagine an idealistic young Godfrey going to defend the land of Christ and turning into the disillusioned, but honourable warrior. Did the script not adequately supply Bloom with the material? or would we not have believed him if it did?  <br /> <br />I will watch it again to see the paintings brought to life but not because the movie makes me feel great emotion, like the best movies do.  <br />
B000002GK1|4.0|A lot of times Nirvana and Pearl Jam get the credit for putting Seattle on the map, (Heart, Hendrix and Queensryche were before any of them) but I believe that this 1989 release was the pinnacle of anything that came out from this genre in the last 16 years. I also don't beleive that anything that Creed, Three Doors Down or Nickleback will ever come close to. Starting off the record are 2 of the best hard rock songs ever written. Rusty Cage and Outshinned are just 6 star songs if there ever was any. The album goes downhill from there, although there is not a bad track on here.<br /><br />right now we can all use a new Soundgarden CD.
B000001FTD|5.0|As the above, editorial review notes, Metallica and Slayer invented thrash, but Anthrax are just as innovative, because they brought it to the east coast and added some punk touches/flavor to it. Plus, Joey Belladonna and Co. practically invented (or popularized) shout-along refrains. (Most every track on here has a shout along.) \\"Among the Living\\" is an \\"adrenaline pumping\\" album with exciting and contagious songs, which are full to the brim with circular, buzzsaw riffs, fast, thumping drums, beeping bass notes, catchy shout along choruses, energetic beats, and winding guitar solos. Plus, Joey chooses to actually sing (in addition to shout) in several places. Thus, songs like \\"I Am The Law\\" and \\"Indians\\" have a melodic edge, and show that Joey can really hold a note well. Other highlights include the album opening title track, \\"Caught In A Mosh,\\" the slower \\"A Skeleton In The Closet,\\" \\"One World\\" (which has a whiplash tempo change near the beginning), and, of course, my personal favorite \\"Efilnikcufecin (N.F.L.).\\" The bottom line is this is doubtlessly the best, catchiest, and most contagious album Anthrax ever released. It's absolutely essential for 1980's thrash fans, and you should also start here if you're new to this band.

0786715103|5.0|I will never forget this book; it is a difficult and at times terrible book to read. Dallaire tells the story of his experiences in Rwanda as the lead man in the U.N. Peacekeeping mission. As the horrible events in Rwanda unfolded, he pleaded with the UN and its powerful members to help with troops, equipment, everything and got very little and was unable to prevent the massacre of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 100 days. He describes the chaos of the situation in gripping and harrowing detail. Though I had read Gourevitch and Powers works on the subject, I was shocked by the raw power and emotion of this first-hand account. Dallaire is unsparing in his criticism of the UN and the US, claiming that if they had acted more quickly thousands of lives could have been spared, an allegation that gains support from Clinton's similar admission of regret in his recent autobiography. Anyone who is interested in human rights or the preventable holocaust in Rwanda would be highly advised to read this book--but be prepared to be disturbed and shaken. <br /> <br />
B00006AFUR|5.0|Jared Leto doesn't fall into the normal category of an actor who decides on a whim one day that he will try his hand at singing. 30 Seconds To Mars is a unique, inspiring blend of 80's synthesizers, progessive elements, and cosmic alternative rock. This band is fronted by Jared and his bro but rather than sending the usual message of, \\"look at me I can act and sing\\", this album sends the listener on a celestial journey provoking deep thoughts and questions regarding life. Each song is powerful in its own way. EDGE OF THE EARTH, ECHELON, AND WELCOME TO THE UNIVERSE being amongst my favorites. If you are looking for something different not only out of rock but also out of actors turned singers....check out 30 Seconds To Mars.

0812548094|3.0|This book borrows just a little to heavily from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time debacle for my taste (even down to the smoothing of skirts, if you can believe that).  <br /> <br />On top of that, it's becoming a tad predictable, depending on how much of the genre you've read. The idea that it goes on for seven more books is a little frightening to me if this is the tone that's being set for the series this early. <br /> <br />Again, depending on how much of the genre you've read, this is an enjoyable read if you're not expecting any ground-breaking ideas or direction, or a break in formula, and just looking for a fun book.
B00000JCB2|4.0|When Limp Bizkit released \\"Significant Other\\" in 1999, they were not only very popular, but almost everyone thought they were a promising young band who showed real, credible songwriting skills. Now, I'm not a Limp Bizkit fanatic, but the truth about this album is, if you listen to it with an open mind, you should realize it is actually pretty good. Gratuitous profanities (which littered later Limp Bizkit releases) aren't present, here, and some songs (like \\"Re-Arranged,\\" \\"No Sex,\\" and \\"A Lesson Learned\\") have introspective lyrics which are actually pretty mature! Plus, in addition to being very catchy and somewhat exciting, \\"Significant Other\\" has a variety of songs, so it covers all of the bases. \\"Just Like This\\" is a nearly danceable intro track, while songs like \\"Nookie,\\" \\"Breakstuff,\\" and \\"I'm Broke\\" are quite mean and heavy. \\"N 2 Gether Now\\" is a full fledged rap song (with a guest spot from members of Wu Tang Clan), \\"Don't Go Off Wandering\\" is somewhat creepy, \\"Show Me What You Got\\" is a kiss-off which seems made to get the mosh pits swirling, and \\"A Lesson Learned\\" is a very slow, depressing, partly a capella ballad. This might not be saying much, but \\"Significant Other\\" is Limp Bizkit's finest hour. The bottom line is this is a good album, it is arguably rap-rock at its finest, and it actually proves that Limp Bizkit know how to write a few good songs. So, buy this album...just don't tell any of your friends.

B000002GHH|5.0|Bring the Family is one of the most easily likable records of the 80s, and probably the most instantly accessible of Hiatt's career.  He still featurs a couple of songs off here in his live shows.  The band (Hiatt, Nick Lowe on bass, Ry Cooder on guitar, and Jim Keltner on drums) would reconvene in 1992 for another overlooked gem, Little Village.  Here Cooder's gentle sweeping guitar is the perfect compliment for Hiatt's \\"Lipstick Sunset\\" and \\"Tip of My Tongue,\\" two of the most exquisite songs you're likely to hear.  Of course the big hit is \\"Thing Called Love,\\" although not until Bonnie Raitt put it out the following year.<br /><br />A quintessentially American record, probably the best from one of our true masters.  At the place where rock, folk, country, and blues converge to form real, authentic American music.  I'm calling it a classic.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|this review is probably well behind most other positive reviews but time has not deminished it's quality, bordering on hard rock, there are flicks of folk rock and ecoustical melodies that give it a softer edge from the \\"completely\\" hard music, not quite a \\"10\\" but close

B000067DNC|4.0|Yeah every now and then there is a weak episode, but I have never disliked an episode.  The cast is strong.  Despite there being several lead cast members, the writing is able to provide enough coverage for each based upon the story.  Other shows with a lead group as large as SG1 seem unable to do that.  I will eventually complete the series.  If that is not a strong indicator of how much I like the show, then I don't know what is.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just bought the DVD set and I am about 10 episodes in. I find it tragic that, besides the movie, this will be the entirety of Firefly that fans will get to enjoy. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the movie doesn't appear to be doing that well, harpooning the possibility of Joss Whedon's vision of a movie trilogy. I pray that the Serenity DVD does so well that Universal goes ahead with the remainder of the trilogy.
B00079FUI6|4.0|When I was a kid, every TV program started and ended in the alloted time-- 30 or 60 minutes and everything was all wrapped up-- so you could watch any episode of any show and not feel the need to be \\"caught up.\\"  With serials, if you miss the boat up front you might decide not to watch the show at all-- or, you might hop on and feel like you've been left out of the secret club.<br /><br />More and more, people are waiting for the DVD to enjoy a season of programming.  So here we have the opportunity to consider Desperate Housewives, season one, as a whole work.  There are some common misconceptions about the show.  First, that it is a drama, or \\"nighttime soap.\\"  In fact, although the plots flow and tease from one episode into the next, the show is a comedy disguised as a drama.  (Note that Huffman, Cross, and Hatcher were nominated for the Best Actress in a comedy emmy category.)  And it is wickedly funny, more so because you get the feeling that not everyone watching is in on the joke.<br /><br />Second, the early publicity painted this show as a sex romp-- four (or five) \\"desparate\\" housewives, living and loving on one cozy suburban street.  But no; in reality this is a murder mystery, one that reels you in from the very first hour. The sexual content was overhyped because one of the very first scenes of the first show depicts the Eve Longoria character having an affair with her teenage gardener.  But what made this show sizzle were the two predominant mysteries: why did Mary Alice kill herself, and what became of Deirdre, the woman Mike was searching for?  (And who was \\"Dana\\"?)  These mysteries gave the show its addictive quality.  And the arc of the story over the season-- and the way the two plots eventually intertwine-- is a brilliant piece of writing, and an example of serial TV at its best.  Good serial TV works as a whole, singular piece of art; the body of episodes is better than any individual one.  Such is the case here; you have one meticulously thought out and crafted set of story and they unfold and bounce off each other and intersect with sheer perfection as the season races to its conclusion.<br /><br />Mary Alice is the fifth housewife, and she narrates the episodes as an all-seeing presence; she kills herself at the very beginning of the first show, and spends the rest of the season wryly observing the foibles of her former friends and neighbors with a weary, knowing detachment. The show also works as a commentary on American suburbia, with everything too perfect and pastel, and the lawns too finely manicured; think Edward Scissorhands, with dark comedy replacing goth.<br /><br />All SIX housewives (the big four, plus Mary Alice, plus Edie Britt, the local hot slut played by Nicole Sheridan) are distinctly drawn, and sexy and beautiful.  Longoria was the breakout star, probably because her character was sleeping with the gardener, but for my money he real hottie is clumsy Susan, played by the incandescent Teri Hatcher.<br /><br />This show is way better than you probably expect if you haven't watched much of it.  At first you will feel like it is a guilty pleasure.  But as you begin to appreciate the quality of the writing, and the dark undercurrent (it is after all narrated by an all-American mom who has shot hersellf), you will lose the guilt and be left with pleasure.  This is American pop culure at its best and most knowingly campy, and if you want to participate in American pop culture you owe it to yourself to take the plunge.thought out and crafted set of story and they unfold and bounce off each other and intersect with sheer perfection as the season races to its conclusion. <br /> <br />Mary Alice is the fifth housewife, and she narrates the episodes as an all-seeing presence; she kills herself at the very beginning of the first show, and spends the rest of the season wryly observing the foibles of her former friends and neighbors with a weary, knowing detachment. The show also works as a commentary on American suburbia, with everything too perfect and pastel, and the lawns too finely manicured; think Edward Scissorhands, with dark comedy replacing goth. <br /> <br />All SIX housewives (the big four, plus Mary Alice, plus Edie Britt, the local hot slut played by Nicole Sheridan) are distinctly drawn, and sexy and beautiful.  Longoria was the breakout star, probably because her character was sleeping with the gardener, but for my money he real hottie is clumsy Susan, played by the incandescent Teri Hatcher. <br /> <br />This show is way better than you probably expect if you haven't watched much of it.  At first you will feel like it is a guilty pleasure.

B000A88F22|1.0|Alright, who's coming up with fake SNs and giving this 5-stars. Probably those Jive fools. :\
B00005JNBQ|3.0|There's something about high school that provides endless fodder for great movies.  \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High,\\" \\"Sixteen Candles,\\" and \\"The Breakfast Club\\" captured the '80s angst of my high school years.  \\"Election\\" and \\"Rushmore\\" may be about the generation after mine, but both movies had so much truth and wisdom that they spoke to a geezer like me as well as their target audience.  I know I'll watch all of these movies in 20 years and they will still ring true to me then.    \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" tries to be in the same mold as these essential films.  It tries to skewer the dark underbelly of high school, with its baseless favoritism, its soulless disregard for the unpopular, and its mind-numbing tedium.  To a certain extent, \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" succeeds - there are a few laugh-out-loud moments about the truth of high school life.    But \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" falls a bit through its titular hero.  Napoleon may be the biggest geek ever to have his own film.  To a certain extent, Napoleon is universal.  Like every high school student, his inner talents are bound by insecurity and immaturity.  So Napoleon responds with lies (the fictitious girlfriend from Oklahoma, the mastery of martial arts) and insults to protect himself.  Who didn't do something like that when they were 15?      And while Napoleon has an undeniable sweetness to him, the movie keeps the audience at arm's length.  This is a movie populated by morons, dweebs, and dorks.  They speak in sudden bursts of banality.  While the cast generally has the pent-up insecurity down, the movie screams for someone like Max Fischer from \\"Rushmore\\" to speak with poetry and spirit about who he is and where he wants to go.    Instead, \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" offers no hope for its characters (some of whom it seems to love).  The high school students are varying degrees of cloistered non-entities, and the adults generally seem to be the same.  When Napoleon's older brother gets married to a towering African American, LaFonda, she is played strictly for laughs and he remains the same befuddled twit, only now in gangsta garb.  Sure, it's funny, and LaFonda's devotion to him is as sweet as it is inexplicable.  But it doesn't seem to go anywhere other than to the surreal.  No character offers Napoleon any hope that his future in the wilds of Idaho offers anything other than endless years of frustration and yearning -- playing tetherball, even with your soulmate, gets old after a while.    Indeed, when the DJ plays Alphaville's cheesy \\"classic\\" \\"Forever Young\\" at a dance, the lyric \\"I want to be forever young\\" doesn't seem like an anthem to these kids.  It feels more like a prison sentence.    Yet I'm glad that I've seen \\"Napoleon Dynamite.\\"  Not only did I get some genuine laughs out of the movie, I now understand the point of all those retro \\"Vote for Pedro\\" T-shirts I've been seeing.    A funny movie that's worth a rental, but not a slot in the video library.
B000002UD1|4.0|While this album is not quite a classic, it is still a solid album by John Lennon.  \\"Mind Games\\" is, of course, a classic song that everyone remembers.  But there are several other good songs, like \\"Out the Blue\\", \\"Only People\\" and \\"Meat City\\".  And, of course, the \\"Nutopian International Anthem\\" just may be the best song Lennon ever wrote.  John Lennon fans will probably enjoy this album.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris is right on target with this book. Religion, as we know it, it outdated. It's an unpopular belief, but religion is fairy tale. Mr. Harris explains his position and is most concerned that others should be able to verbalize their beliefs, even if they are not politically correct. This book hit a nerve with me and gave some of my beliefs credibitity. This is a must read for anyone interested in exploring their own belief systems.

B000BCKFWK|5.0|Frank Miller Sin City finally gets made into a faithful comic book adaptation into a film.Frank Miller after having bad experience with Hollywood he had given up the idea of making Sin City into a film.But the only person that could convince him and get his trust was the talented Robert Rodriguez.All he had to was a little audition tape like a short film for Frank Miller and that's all he needed.He was impressed and so are we with one of best comic book films there is.    Robert Rodriguez does beautiful job of transferring it into a film.Giving a Frank Miller a chance to co-direct a film resulting Rodriguez leaving the Directors Guild Of America.Because the guild has some weird rules on co directors they didnt allow this.So thats whay he left the Guild.Only in circumstances that the two directors are brothers could they co directa film.Sin City compromising from three stories.\\"The Hard Good-Bye\\",\\"The Big Fat Kill\\",\\"That Yellow Bastard\\" and also a short story \\"The Customer Is Always Right\\" that we see in the beginning.\\"The Hard Good-Bye\\" tells the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke) and his search for the killer of Goldie (Jamie King) threw his search he goes deeper threw the corruption of Basin City and finding the one responsible.In this story we have a unforgettable performance by Mickey Rouke as Marv.He is really the definition of a antihero.Also a surprising performance by Elijah Wood as Kevin.I mean from a good old Hobbit to a crazy killer he gives very good performance.Also playing is Carla Gugino as Lucile Marv's parole officer.We all remember her from Rodriguez Spy Kids.Then we have \\"The Big Fat Kill\\"  that revolves around Dwight (Clive Owen) and Jackie Boy and the balance of Old Town,the Police and the Mob and the deal between them.Rosario Dawson plays Gail the leader of Old Town.In this one we have Clive Owen having a American accent and doing very well and being cool in this story.Also we get a special guest director in one of the scenes the one and only Quentin Tarantino he did it as repaying the favor of Rodriguez scoring Kill Bill Volume 2.In the third and last story \\"That Yellow Bastard.We have Hartigan (Bruce Willis) trying to protect little old Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) from the crazy son of Senator Rourke Junior (Nick Stahl).He has to protect Nancy keep his code of honesty and not come to corruption.    This film has one of the best ensemble casts I have seen.From all the actors I have mentioned there are still so many to mention as well.From Michael Madesen,Alexis Bidel,Devon Aeoki,Rosario Dawson,Powers Boothe,Rughter Hauer,Josh Harnett and lots of others.They play there characters perfectly were casted very well.    The film is identical in so many ways to the comic.From shot to shot analyses to dialogue to characters.Rodriguez is really putting Miller's vision to the screen and not really his.The effects are amazing for being all on green screen and seeming so real.The only real set built was the bar in the film.The look is very film noir.And really the thing that brings this film together a lot is the music.By Rodriguez,John Debney and Graham Revell.The music suits the film in so many ways.It adds to the suspense the noir feeling of the film woth some nice jazz stuff in the theme in the start.The score is one of the best ive heard.Also Rodriguez directs,edits,scores and photographs the film.He is really a talented guy.Doing all of that at the same time cooperating with another directors and scoring the music as well.This film I have to mention kind of violent.To tell you truth it has to be.If it wasn't violent in that way we wouldn't believe we were in the world of Sin City.What also great about this film is the use of voiceover.I think that my favorite part of film hearing what characters are thinking about and what they feel and how to face their troubles.You don't find very good voiceover often that immerses you into the film.    This DVD is jam packed with extras.The set will include both the 124 minutetheatrical release, along with the 147 minute extended cut. Both will be presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, along with English DTS 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround tracks. Extras will include a commentary with director Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, a second commentary with Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino and a third commentary containing Austin Premiere crowd reaction! Also included will be a 15 minute film school with the director, a Movie in High-Speed Green Screen feature, 17 uninterrupted minutes of Tarantino's segment, footage of a Sin City cast/crew party, and a 10 minute cooking school with Robert Rodriquez. Completing the package will be four featurettes on the cars, special effects make-up, costumes and props, a featurette on how they convinced Miller to assist with the film, another featurette on casting, a featurette on Tarantino the guest director, trailers, bloopers, and an interactive game. Topping it all off will be a complete Sin City graphic novel (The Hard Goodbye).    I think this one of the best films of the year.And all fans will be waiting for the arrival of the next film.A interview that Robert Rodriguez  gave he said that the next one will be \\"A Dame To Kill For\\".That features Marv,Dwight,Gail and everybody else in the world of Sin City.
B000002UAO|5.0|This was the Beatles second album of 1965, and it's another 5 star classic.  It features one great song after another.  Just look at the songlist.  \\"Drive My Car\\", \\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"Nowhere Man\\", \\"Think For Yourself\\", \\"Michelle\\", \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", \\"In My Life\\".  Classics all.  Highly recommended.
630242335X|4.0|Not a great movie, \\"Undiscovered Country\\" is still great enough among Trek flicks to be unmissable.  A tight script, great acting and razor-sharp direction not only make \\"Undiscovered Country\\" an unstoppable ride, but also iron out how entertaining Trek could be in the right hands. <br /> <br />THE PLOT: UC hints at the fall of the Soviet empire - replacing the Klingons (perennial baddies in Trek) with the luckless Russians of our age.  When the story starts, the Klingons have suffered a Chernobyl-style industrial accident that bankrupts them.  Forced to sue for peace, the Klingons find mixed reactions from the humans, some of whom would feel safer negotiating with the Klingons after they collapsed.  Inviting disaster (or maybe obeying the Vulcan dictum that \\"Only Nixon could go to China\\") Earth sends Captain Kirk to escort Gorkcon (David Warner), the Klingons' visionary Chancellor to peace talks.  Kirk, having nursed his own grudge against the Klingons for killing his son (as everybody knows, this happened in Trek-III) feels dragooned into the mission (he was recommended by Spock).  Determined to go anyway, Kirk is blindsided when the Klingons are attacked - apparently by the Enterprise - and Gorckon murdered.  With Kirk arrested and tried by the Klingons, Spock tries to uncover the conspiracy responsible for Gorckon's murder, save the Captain and prevent another assassination which may doom hopes for peace forever. <br /> <br />No matter how many times I try to summarize UC, it never gets much thicker than the above - but UC excels anyway.  The old-show characters have never worked better off each other.  The script bravely transcends Trekkie sentimentality: at one point, it looks like the end of the Spock/Kirk friendship, as Kirk nearly lets his hatred of the Klingons get in the way of Spock's better sense; we even get the specter of a rather malicious Kirk - \\"let them die\\" he says of the desperate Klingons.  Direction here eschews the bland smoothness of \\"The Next Generation\\" - scene transitions and music add to the character.  And technobabble?  None here.  Beside the usual characters, the script tosses in some meaty newcomers - the late Brock Peters in an underwritten but juicy role as a bellicose Federation officer, a younger Kim Cattral as a sweetly sexy Vulcan and Christopher Plummer as a barely regenerate Klingon cold warrior, who spouts Shakespeare in Klingonese as he confronts his enemies.  This is more than the swan-song of the original cast - it puts the torch to the Next Generation.

B0002XDODU|5.0|As an avid fan of Rammstein, and a fan that can actually speak the language, I had to purchase this next disc.  Right from the first song, I was slapped with a great tune with very catchy rhythm - Reise Reise, in my opinion the best song on the CD.  This CD has music from them that is not in the general association as the rest of their CDs.  Reise, Reise has a much slower and mellow pace to it, but the rhythm and melodies are perfect.  And the major good point on this disc that I must add, is Amerika.  It isn't very often that you get to hear Rammstein speak in English.  All in all, a great CD with superb music.  Definately a must buy for all Rammstein fanatics, like I, and even for those of you who aren't so sure whether you'll like the new Rammstein style.  Just get the album.  You will not be disappointed.
0670033375|5.0|Dr. Diamond's book,is an excellent review of that overwhelming but poorly understood dynamic of chaos and complexity within a social structure. <br /> <br />Excellent written, his research demonstrates that we need to evaluate all social systems within our grasp as the decisions made by us today will have some consequence within our lives tomorrow.   <br /> <br />I will warn some that this is a read that takes some thought, even as some books do not. This is not a book that will interest many - in particular if you think that the world is just spinning on its merry, without individual impact from its abiding cultures and peoples.  <br /> <br />If anything ,this book will cause its readers to think, a much needed skill in tiday's world.
B0006399FS|4.0|I am, like many who have reviewed this cd, a long time U2 fan and I must say this album is strong, its really only hurt by Bono's voice (a little to rough). Fans since the Joshua Tree have complained that U2 needed to go back to thier guitar drum etc sound. They complained that U2 were to experimental and needed to go back to thier roots.<br /><br />Well U2 has decided with thier past 2 albums to give fans what they wanted and what do fans say. Oh what happen to the experimental U2, I loved \\"POP\\" though of course that wasn't the tune they sung when that album came out. I say all of this because in the end if you like a more traditional U2 then this album is as strong as thier older material. It won't be recognized until years later when fans are crying about how they loved this album and hate the new stuff. In the end this album holds its own and should be a definite inclusion in your u2 catalog.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|I've been listening to this CD all day and like it a lot. Buddy Guy plays with inventiveness, rawness, spit and fire that will hit your senses and emotions.  Just put on the scorching track \\"Cut You Loose\\" and you will hear why he's still the Stratocaster master. The whole album has some of the coolest guitar I've heard in a long time. It's bluesy, kick ass, funky and soulful.   Guy's voice is as good or better than ever.  Listen to the wrath and jealousy of his vocals on \\"I Put A Spell On You.\\" Or the polish of his falsetto on \\"Now You're Gone.\\" Or the sex oozing on \\"I Put A Spell On You.\\" Or his soul on \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" and \\"Do Your Thing.\\"   It hardly matters what type of songs Guy plays, since he is dazzling on most tracks.  And he gives new meaning to cover songs, just as he did when he covered John Hiatt's \\"Feels Like Rain\\" years ago.  The album has great guest artists too, including Carlos Santana, Keith Richards, Tracy Chapman, Anthony Hamilton, Keb Mo' and John Mayer.   \\"Bring Em In\\" may not be as exciting as one of Guy's fantastic live shows or as rock oriented as Stone Crazy, but it certainly won't disappoint you and the production is sharp. The album is good for making passionate love or just for easy listening. But if you need a punch in your gut, I Put A Spell on Your or Cut You Loose will do the job. <br /> <br />Of all the blues guitarists who influenced the 1960s rock legends, Buddy Guy came closest to creating the guitar template that helped shape younger players, from Eric Clapton to Jimi Hendrix. Yet the musician so deserving of all these rave reviews is very likely unknown to many of you because, by the time people appreciated what Guy was playing, his biggest fans Hendrix, Clapton and company had copied his ideas and riffs. Sadly, many people still don't own a Buddy Guy album or understand what they've been missing.
B0009UC7HA|5.0|I found this Dvd to be excellent. Received in good time and in excellent condition. I had seen the movie and knew that I was going to really enjoy having this Dvd.Great acting and I loved the music. Highly recommend to everyone who loves Clive Cussler.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|I'm a '65 vintage and was born to the sounds of 'Let It Bleed' & 'High Tide, Green Grass' by the Rolling Stones.  'Howl' has the essence of the Blues, Gospel and the between-the-wars Angst that struck during the Depression.  <br /> <br />They're telling a story, only just a bit slower than they normally do, so you feel more of the vibe.   <br /> <br />This album is going to smolder for years and never go away...
B000AA305M|1.0|I bought this CD not being aware of Copy Protection CDs.  I wish I had known about it, because I probably would never have bought this CD.   <br /> <br />In order to listen to this CD on a computer it installs SunnComm's MediaMax DRM copy protection, which I equate to parasitic spy ware or virus ware that severely limits this albums usefulness.  SunnComm's only suggested way, to rip and encode the songs for use in a MP3 player, is using the inadequate software provided on CD.   In doing so you end up down sampling the audio quality twice (once to wma then again to mp3), resulting in poor sounding music files.   <br /> <br />I have a collection of hundreds of LEGAL CDs, which I encode into a personal (read not shared) music library to enjoy as I please.    I use to pride myself on being an honest musical customer by purchasing each CD, but this copy protection is a slap in the face.  I will be sure not to purchase another copy protection CD ever again.   <br />
B0002EXH4K|4.0|1992 must surely have been an pivotal year for Megadeth. Fueled by a solid lineup which would prove to be their longest lasting thus far, they were also fresh off the success of their masterpeice, RUST IN PEACE. A true classic of metal, RUST IN PEACE was the album which finally put Megadeth in a position to potentially challenge Metallica for the heavy metal crown.     Thus it was that, in 1992, they released COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION. With its stripped down sounds, the album seemed to be a response to Metallica's massivly successful 'Black Album,' a year earlier. From the first moments of \\"Skin O' My Teeth,\\" COUNTDOWN reminds us that few can write a guitar riff like Dave Mustaine. \\"Skiin O' My Teeth\\" is a great song that starts the album off well, and is immediatly followed us by another stellar bit of Mustaine riffage \\"Symphony of Distruction.\\" The album continues to display a number a great songs, including \\"Foreclosure of a Dream\\" which features a nicely contrasting mellow verse and speedy chorus (plus a none too flattering cameo from then-president George H. W. Bush).     Despite the fact that there are some undeniably excellent songs on this album, it's difficult to avoid noticing that there are some songs on this album which can only be called filler. Sure, \\"Psychotron\\" and \\"Captive Honor\\" are enjoyable enough to listen to, but they certainly leave no lasting memories once done. The album is also plagued by a bit too much reliance on traditional verse-chorus patterns, making it too predictable in places, which is slightly dissappointing after the twisting progressive epics of RUST IN PEACE.     Overall, it isn't 100% successful, but that doesn't prevent it from being one of the great rock records of the 90s, well deserving of its number two spot on the charts (that it was robbed of number one by \\"Achey Breaky Heart,\\" of all things, is truly one of the crimes of the century). COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION is a great album, well woprthwhile for any fan of rock or metal.
B00007AJF8|5.0|Stop laughing and step back a minute---\\"Being John Malkovich\\" isn't funny, it's a horror movie. Alright---it's funny, *and* it's a horror movie.<br /><br />Somewhere, somehow, sometime, someplace (possibly Providence, Rhode Island) Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft got together. Genes were spliced. The warped and twisted biological result was Spike Jonze, one of modern cinema's most insidious, surreptious, diabolically gifted and wickedly talented filmmakers and the most Terrible of the Enfants Terribles stalking the American academy of Arts and Letters today.<br /><br />Having helmed the infamous Beastie Boys \\"Sabotage\\" video, Jonze and partner-in-crime Charlie Kaufman were ready to cobble together a Trojan Horse and aim it at the dark heart of Fortress Hollywood.<br /><br />They succeeded massively with the darkly subversive \\"Being John Malkovich\\", the story of a disaffected puppeteer (played by John Cusack) who discovers a secret aperture into the mind of actor John Malkovich.<br /><br />Some wrong-headedly think this is a surreal comedy. Poor, naive, childish innocents, I say! I'm here to contend that for all its comedic trappings, \\"Being John Malkovich\\" is a horror movie that H.P. Lovecraft himself would appreciate.<br /><br />Yes, I know, the title itself is risible, the notion of a portal into John Malkovich's consciousness makes one giddy, and you can't possibly have a proper cosmos-ripping horror movie with Cameron Diaz, John Cusack, John Malkovich, and Charlie Sheen. I know all the standard objections.<br /><br />But first: if you haven't seen \\"Being John Malkovich\\", stop reading this silly review and go buy the thing. You'll be utterly delighted and glad you listened to my advice.<br /><br />Alright, for those of you who have seen this wicked little gem of sheer cinematic subversion---listen up: \\"Being John Malkovich\\" is a horror movie, not a comedy, a long-toothed snarling wolf dolled up in comedic sheep's clothing. Think not? Fine: let's leave the idea of John Malkovich having his body snatched out of it. If the idea of a blameless, innocent, blithe little girl being invaded by a small platoon of slobbering geriatrics isn't horror, then nothing is horrible.<br /><br />Still skeptical? That's fine, but be warned: everything in in Jonze and Kaufman's little tour de force here is expertly stage-managed and distilled to a single purpose, and that is fooling the innocent, naive viewer to the movie's singularly malign purpose: body-snatching is front and center here. If you think this is a comedy, dear friend, then you're being duped with fine food and good wine, just the tools the wicked immortal Dr. Lester (a fine turn by the great Orson Bean, with nods to Lovecraft's \\"Terrible Old Man\\") used, as the evil Captain Merten had used before him.<br /><br />Think about it this way: what happened to Malkovich once Craig and Maxine's little entrepreneurial scheme took on a life of its own? Still feel like a good horse laugh? I'm thinking a stiff Scotch is more in order.<br /><br />The direction and cinematography here are spot on, and every scene tells. The acting is also superb, from Cusack's dangerously desperate puppeteer, to veteran actors Bean and the late Byrne Piven (Captain Merten, who pities dwarves), to Catherine Keener, who plays the wicked, devious, Machiavellian shrew Maxine. I despised her every second she was on screen---good job, Miss Keener!<br /><br />The real plaudits go to Cameron Diaz. I had never really considered Diaz an actress of substance, but her wildly schizophrenic romp as the crazed animal-lover Lotte showed the woman has some finely honed acting chops. Charlie Sheen sinks his fangs into his tiny but tasty role, and Malkovich purrs through the movie like a kitten.<br /><br />Surreal, quirky, brilliantly paced, constantly resourceful, occasionally creepy, with a haunting, pining score by Carter Burwell and Bjork that calls to mind Philip Glass's composition for \\"Mishimia\\", \\"Being John Malkovich\\"is a clever, wicked, blackly funny work of genius, but it is very much a horror film. Having returned from a jaunt through his own tortured subconscious, Malkovich roars \\"I have seen things no man should have to see.\\" Truer words couldn't have frothed from the lips of one of Lovecraft's tentacle-tormented heroes.<br /><br />Still not convinced? Look at \\"Malkovich's\\" ample horror trappings: a skewed, twisted crawlspace of an office, forcing its denizens to walk in a crouch and situated between the floors of the building; a Terrible Old Man, confounded by an illusory speech impediment, who has chronicled the life of his unwitting host in a back-room; Dwarf Love;---and of course, bodysnatching.<br /><br />To say nothing of this prospect: imagine the sensation of a horde of hungry, greedy, ancient eyes crawling across your body, a mulifaceted invasion force perched just behind the two innocuous irises of your dinner-mate.<br /><br />Does that give you the giggles? It gives me the crawls.<br /><br />Still laughing?<br /><br />JSG\\"Mishimia\\", \\"Being John Malkovich\\" is a clever, wicked, blackly funny work of genius, but it is very much a horror film.

B000067CPX|4.0|This is Red Hot Chili Peppers first album from the new millenium and its still as strong as ever.Not directly as heavy as some of there earlier albums,but thats not a bad thing.<br /><br />\\"Don't Foregt Me\\", is a fine example of what 20 years of maturity can do.Songs like \\"Bye The Way\\", may seem familiar to RHCP fans  and even remind you of \\"Under The Bridge\\" with a modern pop touch.<br /><br />\\"Can't Stop\\"  is one of those songs that will put you in a good mood.The vibes from it sounds happy and upgoing and at the same time it's just a good song.The music video is fairly funny too.<br /><br />Many lesser herd songs are just as great like<br /><br />\\"Throw Away Your Television\\" it has RHCP's bassy trademark.The lyrics matured too.<br /><br />In this modern world music is lacking ecspecially this new \\"EMO\\" era.RHCP though still stands true.If you are looking for the next \\"Californacation\\" RHCP's 7th studio album well in my opinion it's not here.If you are looking for something entirley new but with the echoes of there old stuff then buy this.<br /><br />It's not the best album nore is it the worst it's an album you pick up and enjoy almost every song and agree it was well worth your money.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|ELF is the sort of movie that can keep you coming back, even a would-be doubter like me.  No, I don't doubt the existence of Santa Claus and, no, I don't doubt the existence of Peter Pan (Johnny Depp convinced me of that one).  I doubted a story about a gigantic Christmas elf and starring Will Farrell.  Farrell, admittedly a new comic genius, just seemed way too \\"out there\\" to pull this one off so I didn't watch it until my two sons dared me to.<br /><br />In a word: charming!  Farrell is wonderful as Buddy, a misplaced orphan who goes there (to the North Pole) and back again (to New York City) on a wonderful Christmas odyssey that is right up there with THE SANTA CLAUSE.  Ed Asner is absolutely spectacular as Santa.  His explanation of Christmas Cheer and its impact on certain Christmas traditions is about as good a thing as clapping in order to revive fallen fairies ala Peter Pan.<br /><br />It was also good to see James Caan in his warmest role since BRIAN'S SONG, playing Buddy's human father. On Santa's \\"Bad List\\" but with considerable hope. I was beginning to think he had just become the consummate bad guy.  Maybe some of that Christmas cheer found its way into old Jimmy's heart?  Could very well be.<br /><br />Elf also sports an exceptional supporting cast including Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father, Papa Elf, Mary Steenburgen as Caan's movie wife, Emily and Daniel Tay as Buddy's human brother, Michael.  Zooey Deschanel is perfect as Buddy's love interest, Jovie.  Pick this one up for Christmas 2005 and for many Christmases to come!<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Robert Johnson left us only 29 pieces of music but in those 29 pieces of music we are able to celebrate a real genius.  The Robert Johnson box set of 1990 was a revelation to anyone who loves the blues.<br /><br />I have seen reviews of the Johnson boxed set to the effect that many people had bought the set but few really listened to it.  I am not sure where that information comes from but that would be a shame.  If one does listen to it one hears a real artist with every note and every phrase.<br /><br />Eric Clapton agrees and has taken many of those works and offered his interpretation of each.  That his interpretations are different, no doubt, but they are faithful to the composer and he clearly loves the work.<br /><br />Clapton has addressed several of these pieces before, Malted Milk and others but this collection is not MTV unplugged recycled.  Robert Johnson spent his short existence playing, singing, and celebrating and his versatility is on display here.<br /><br />Some have critizized Clapton for not being \\"faithful\\" to the blues or changing tempos etc.  In my opinion, those critiques miss the mark.  Are these greats songs---undoubtedly.  Does Clapton play them with respect---you bet.  Should you purchase this CD---don't wait.<br /><br />Great art asks for many and varied interpretations--why else sing it later?  Johnson and Clapton together are in the spirit of that dictum.
B00005JKC3|5.0|I'll just ask you this: isn't it better to have a trippy, funky, eccentric flick like Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" than no Hulk movie at all?<br /><br />Look, let's boil Ang Lee's rippingly fun new movie 'Hulk' down to its core components: it's about brilliant nanotechnological research scientist Bruce Banner who one day, while working in his lab, gets 'belted' by Gamma rays. What should have been a fatal exposure combines with certain---erm, genetic irregularities---to create some major anger management problems for Dr. Banner.<br /><br />You see, every time he gets angry---really angry---he turns into a big green man. A big green man with expandable purple stretch pants that assist with his modesty during his transformations from Eric Bana into a completely CGI-generated bright green monster.<br /><br />A big green man that hurls tanks and helicopters about like they were toys. A big green man whose erstwhile captor, General Ross (played competently but shallowly by Sam Elliot), decides to let escape from an underground Area 51-esque base, the better to 'fight him outside.'<br /><br />Umm, OK. The truth is that Ang Lee brings his stellar cinematic sensibilities (from movies like \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and \\"Sense and Sensibility\\") to Marvel's storied Incredible Hulk: like the little nanites that flow through Bruce's body and the gamma rays, the marriage of Lee to the comic book material results in a whole that is greater---and greener---than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />'Hulk' is solidly entertaining, visually gorgeous, and---especially for a summer blockbuster---an unusually experimental film that manages to entertain and startle simultaneously.<br /><br />Those who go to \\"Hulk\\" looking for stellar special effects will leave highly satisfied. SEE:<br /><br />*green gamma-ray mushroom clouds!<br /><br />*nasty insane killer giant poodles!<br /><br />*Banner's mad scientist father David, who undergoes some startling transformations of his own (seriously: Nolte doesn't just *chew* scenery in this movie, he absorbs it!)!<br /><br />*the incredible battle sequences between the Hulk and his tormentors---be they the hideous hulk-Dogs or our brave boys in the US Army---the latter pitted against the real \\"Army of One\\"!<br /><br />The special effects centerpiece award of \\"Hulk\\" goes, of course, to the eponymous hero: the Hulk himself is completely computer generated. Does it work?<br /><br />Actually, the Hulk is one of the superhero pandemic's most sympathetic characters, and displays far more humanity than his alter ego, played with considerable reticence by Eric Bana. The last superhero we saw who was this withdrawn was Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />The acting here is all top-notch, and there aren't any uneven performances: Bana doesn't exactly reprise his \\"Chopper\\" performance---he's way too restrained---but then again, he's a nice counterpoint to his lab-destroying Green Inner Child. Jennifer Connelly re-affirms her position as Hollywood's most gorgeous underrated actress. Nick Nolte plays his leering, rasping role to the hilt, and ultimately steals the show.<br /><br />There are times where the movie gets a little too awkward and goofy for its own good: I'd still love to know where the Hulk gets his one-size-fits-all purple stretch pants. There's Josh Lucas's death scene, in which they freeze frame the horrified Lucas in front of an explosion---highly goofy, but very comic booky, and it works; I laughed, anyway.<br /><br />The Hulk's surrender scene in downtown San Francisco also makes little sense; after all, if the Big Green Guy is so fond of leaping, why doesn't he just leap out of the way of all those army men and hop over to Oakland?<br /><br />And speaking of that, what was General Ross thinking when he figures that it's a good idea to let the leap-loving Hulk escape the underground base, reasoning that it will be easier to fight the Big Guy on the surface? Time for a court-martial, Soldier.<br /><br />But even though the buildup and exposition of \\"Hulk\\" makes the movie run a tad long, the film ultimately comes together, a testament to the solidity of its actors, the seamlessness of its CGI, and the talents of both Ang Lee and Director of Photography Fred Elmes, who worked with Lee on \\"Ice Storm\\" and has been a long-time DP for David Lynch (his credits include \\"Eraserhead\\", \\"Wild at Heart\\", and \\"Blue Velvet\\")---so it's no wonder that such lurid, dark emotions can be shot on such a visually brilliant palette.<br /><br />Yes, \\"Hulk\\" is a Evil Dad vs. Good Son movie---and like so many other films that used the same device to telling effect (think Star Wars, or even, in a lopsided way, Spider-Man), \\"Hulk\\" succeeds at a very primal level.<br /><br />\\"Hulk\\", after all, is about secrets repressed under a banal, nondescript surface, about the rage that lurks within all of us. Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" says that if it isn't easy being Green, at least it looks good. Just don't make him angry---you wouldn't like him when he's angry.<br /><br />JSGfor a court-martial, Soldier.  <br /> <br />But even though the buildup and exposition of \\"Hulk\\" makes the movie run a tad long, the film ultimately comes together, a testament to the solidity of its actors, the seamlessness of its CGI, and the talents of both Ang Lee and Director of Photography Fred Elmes, who worked with Lee on \\"Ice Storm\\" and has been a long-time DP for David Lynch (his credits include \\"Eraserhead\\", \\"Wild at Heart\\", and \\"Blue Velvet\\")---so it's no wonder that such lurid, dark emotions can be shot on such a visually brilliant palette.  <br /> <br />Yes, \\"Hulk\\" is a Evil Dad vs. Good Son movie---and like so many other films that used the same device to telling effect (think Star Wars, or even, in a lopsided way, Spider-Man), \\"Hulk\\" succeeds at a very primal level.  <br /> <br />\\"Hulk\\", after all, is about secrets repressed under a banal, nondescript surface, about the rage that lurks within all of us.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|Inevitably the kind of praise this album has garnered can generate a backlash.  When any art or artist becomes popular it becomes \\"bourgeois\\" - at least from certain elitist critical circles.  This album has, thus far, avoided that trap probably because it's not exactly mainstream music.  On the other hand these songs have a direct appeal to anyone who likes modern rock from popular bands like R.E.M. or Talking Heads; but the vocal delivery is more reminiscent of Jeff Buckley or Suede with some of the style of Polyphonic Spree.  (I'd love to hear the recent live material with Bowie at Central Park- no doubt available as a bootleg somewhere as I write this.)  The darkness of the title \\"funeral\\" is not really reflected in the life affirming nature of the lyrics or the music.
0375405380|5.0|<br />I am a prolific reader and this is one of the best books I've ever read. Great writer....and a seemingly inside scoop on the drug trade/war on drugs and crime.  <br />I can't wait to read whatever he writes next!
B00005KHJR|5.0|Have you ever noticed the really funny thing about Religion? No matter where you go, no people, race, or tribe has ever selected somebody other than themselves as God's chosen people.<br /><br />Every religion says \\"God chose *us* to rule the world!\\"; none says \\"God chose those guys in the next county to rule the World!\\".<br /><br />The most atrocious acts of depravity in the history of mankind have been carried out by one godly set of folks against another: burnings, torture, genocide, suicide bombings, missionaries---all justified in the name of the Divine.<br /><br />The Enemy, the Heretic, The Infidel: these people are all Evil because they do not recognize the One True God. They worship a fantasy, a False God, or even worse: the Devil himself.<br /><br />You've probably had lots of discussions with a very religious person; I grew up among them, and I learned in my youth that having a rational argument over the existence of God with the extremely ecclesiastic is useless.<br /><br />It goes something like this: God exists, He wouldn't have permitted the Bible (the means by which He is made manifest) to exist for millennia if it were false, Jesus is both Son of God and God at the same time, we accept these things-all of which contradict our five senses, the only means we have as humans to perceive the world-on Faith.<br /><br />But what of Muslims, or Buddhists, or Mormons, or Animists, you might ask? What if you had been born in one of those religions-wouldn't you have been just as sure of your virtue and Rightness, just as convinced of the power of Allah or Buddha or Moroni or Dark Mother Kali, just as bound to take everything on faith, and just as determined to see Christians as the slaves of the Devil? No, says your subject---I would have seen the light and converted.<br /><br />And take any of the adherents to any of the world's religions, and you'll get the same response. And you also begin to see why religion has persisted for so long: it is emotional body armor, the glue that has bound men together into rough and ready societies for millennia, the single most powerful Meme and primary organizing principle after Food, Shelter, and Sex. Religion is ultimately irrational---by that I mean incapable of being challenged by Reason---because it is founded on Dogma. And when one Dogma meets another, the results range from the Comic to the Grotesque.<br /><br />With that in mind, \\"The Wicker Man\\" is a triple threat.<br /><br />1) Viewed one way, \\"The Wicker Man\\" is about British Police Sergeant Neil Howie and his awful, terrible, miserable, nasty, not-so-good day, and serves as a fine object lesson in the importance of always calling for backup.<br /><br />2) Viewed another way, \\"The Wicker Man\\" is a fable about the very real dangers of epistemological imperialism, in which the by-the-numbers Colonist becomes the by-the-numbers Colonized.<br /><br />3) Viewed yet another way---\\"The Wicker Man\\" is a little bit of both, and a moody, delicious, haunting little creepshow in its own right---and depicts what happens when one set of True Believers slams headlong into another.<br /><br />British Police Sergeant Neil Howie (played with stoic reserve by the great Edward Woodward, who puts the stiff in the British Stiff Upper Lip) travels to the remote Island of Summerisle, off the English coast, after receiving a letter from an islander alerting him to the disappearance of a village girl, the young Rowan Morrison (played fleetingly by Geraldine Cowper).<br /><br />Arriving at the isolated island by seaplane, he proceeds with a standard inquiry into the girl's disappearance, but the rustic islanders are anything but helpful. Sergeant Howie digs in for a long investigation and sets up shop at the local inn, increasingly aware of Summerisle's strangeness, a baroque mix of the whimsical and malevolent.<br /><br />His investigation is hampered by the island's passive-aggressive residents, who offer two flavors of obstruction: baffled surliness and outright derision. And as director Robin Hardy ratchets up the tension and strangeness, Howie encounters pagan rites, toad-licking, a naked and writhing Brit Ekland, and gratuitous folk-singing. No, Toto, we're not in Southeast England anymore.<br /><br />Even the courtly Lord Summerisle (played by the immortal Christopher Lee, who appears to be having the time of his career) seems to be in on a joke that no one bothers to tell Sergeant Howie. Certainly he is concerned, he tells Howie; certainly he will help in any way he can---but only moments before, riding up to the brooding battlements of Summerisle's estate, Howie saw a circle of women, naked and lost in ecstatic abandon, dancing and chanting about a fire.<br /><br />Director Hardy has cobbled together a spellbinder of a film, technically crude (at one point it seemed I was watching outtakes from Woodstock), superficially innocent, but all blood-stained altars and shiny bladed edges beneath the bucolic and charming surface. Edward Woodward was the ideal choice to play Sergeant Howie, a stern, stoic, disapproving Anglican who---much like Summerisle itself---is a man tortured by the undercurrents of desperate wanting beneath his shiny, steely surface. Christopher Lee is equally perfect as Woodward's genteel foil, and to be honest---you've never seen Christopher Lee until you've seen him in \\"The Wicker Man\\".<br /><br />Truly creepy, lushly mysterious, supremely confident, \\"The Wicker Man\\" is an account of precisely what happens when two Dogmatic Tribe---both Chosen People, one side represented by an Island, the other by an outgunned Police constable---meet face to face. Eighties glam-New Wave group Frankie Goes to Hollywood once sang \\"When Two Tribes go to war, One is all that you can Score\\"---but I don't think that's the case in \\"The Wicker Man\\". See for yourself---but doesn't it seem both sides end up getting precisely what they want?<br /><br />JSGwo flavors of obstruction: baffled surliness and outright derision.

Much of Menzies observations are anectdotal and circumstantial in nature, but he raises many questions that cannot be answered.   <br /> <br />After visiting his website and seeing more recent evidence, supported by more and more vetted sources, in conjuction with the DNA theories, one must ask if the world history written in the most part by European Men, did not recognize China's influence?   <br /> <br />If there is a criticism, it would be Menzies constant need to remind us he was a retired submarine skipper in Her Majesty's Fleet.   <br /> <br />Brian
0767831837|5.0|So many reviews bash this film for being a sob-fest, but life is not all peaches and cream, and the reality of divorce, bitter ex-spouses, new relationships, children going through adolescence, and family illness, is very real to a majority of people.  When watching this film, I will agree that many, if not most, of the plot is totally predictable.  You might see things coming from early on.  But this doesn't steal from the fact that Julia and Susan are wonderful actresses, with a wealth of facial expressions and sublties that make them all the more captivating to watch.  Ed Harris doesn't do much more than stand around here, unfortunately.  He has one moving scene, where the emotion seems real, but the tears are fake, yet we still root for him as the dad and ex-husband caught in the middle.  You can really see him act in The Truman Show and The Hours, where he steps up to the plate to deliver extraordinary performances.  Then of course, Step Mom was directed by Chris Columbus and when I see his name on a film I know I'm going to enjoy it...Harry Potter, Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Nine Months, and the list goes on.  I wouldn't choose this 5 tissue film over, let's say, Terms of Endearment, or Beaches, but for me it wins in the category of Real Life Situations played with true talent by well known popular actors.
B0001YFPL4|5.0|Although many Americans do not know Anastacia, she is a humongous success in Europe.  The irony is that she is a Chicago-native. She has talent and an incredible voice that simply cannot be duplicated. She is raw and shows her emotions. She is not all singer though. She writes her own songs and they have meaning. She has been throug Breast Cancer and lives with Crohn's and shows that a person with these ailments can truly survive. This album is a complete turn-around from 'not that kind' and 'Freak of Nature.' She defines her new style as 'sprock' a mixture of soul, pop, and rock. Every song has meaning and therefore everyone can find a song to relate to. My personal favorite is 'Sick and Tired' with a Buddhist chant and a very catchy chorus, the song is sure to stay stuck in your head. 'Welcome to my Truth' is about a personal journey and has a great drum sequence. the best advice i can give is to buy this cd with the bonus dvd. i bought the cd back in november and i ordered this version about a month ago and i am well satisfied. the dvd is great and offers a glimpse into Anastacia's personal life. A true must have for any fan!
B0002234LS|1.0|Poor Mort Rainey! The famous novelist (played effortlessly by Johnny Depp, who earns this wreck its single star) is holed up in his Maine retreat, reeling from his wife's adultery, on the cusp of a brutal divorce, and battling one Grendel of a writer's block.<br /><br />And don't you know, when it rains, it pours: right in the middle of his nap, a furious stranger in a broad-brimmed hat comes rap-rap-rapping at his Chamber Door, accusing the befuddled novelist of \\"stealing his story\\". Would I sit through this shipwreck of a snorefest again? Quoth John Shooter: \\"Nevermore\\".<br /><br />I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to this flick; it had all of the promising ingredients for a spooky little potboiler. It's based on the Stephen King's novella \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\", which is an intimate and nasty tale of obsession and madness and one of the juiciest in King's \\"Four Past Midnight\\". It has Johnny Depp, who can charm the camera with a quirky frown, and John Turturro, equally adept at eccentric roles.<br /><br />Director David Koepp made his directorial debut with the stylish \\"Stir of Echoes\\", while Director of Photography Fred Murphy obviously knows how to wield a camera: he turned out the masterfully moody camera-work in \\"Mothman Prophecies\\". \\"Secret Window\\" even has Philip Glass doing the stress-inducing soundtrack.<br /><br />And certainly the movie starts on the right note: we see Johnny Depp hunched in the driver's seat of a car, toboggan pulled down over his maniac locks, scowling face a-twitch, a snowstorm howling outside the car window.<br /><br />All good stuff, made even more tantalizing when we shift forward six months after the intro's wicked little revelation: now we're holed up in a spooky cabin on equally spooky lake, with a devoted dog, tormented writer, disintegrating marriage, and crazy on the doorstep.<br /><br />What's not to love? Nearly everything.<br /><br />If the synopsis I've given you sounds intriguing, then pick up a copy of Stephen King's \\"Four Past Midnight\\" and read the very creepy story. Unless you're a hardcore Depp fanatic, a masochist, or an insomniac, you'll get no pleasure from this one-way ticket to Dullsville.<br /><br />Koepp gives us no suspense, no tension, no momentum, no scares, certainly no horror. \\"Secret Window\\" is strictly by the numbers, and twenty minutes into the thing it felt like all hands aboard the project---with the exception of the inventive Depp---had lost interest.<br /><br />The direction is dull, the pace plodding, the camerawork listless and strictly point-and-shoot, and worse still, the film's aimlessness seems to infect the actors.<br /><br />The usually interesting Timothy Hutton's (adulterer Teddy) mystifying inclusion merely serves as a reminder of just how good---relatively speaking---the similarly themed \\"The Dark Half\\" really was.<br /><br />The charismatic Charles Dutton (Ken Karsch) is wasted in a role (big, bearish, overconfident P.I.)that was stale back in \\"Thinner\\" and \\"Cape Fear\\": he goes through the motions and cashes a check.

John Turturro (Shooter)lets the hat do the acting.<br /><br />It's not that \\"Secret Window\\" is a howlingly horrible movie---if Koepp had taken some chances, played with the movie, let Depp's natural charisma percolate through the rest of this mummified corpse of a movie, the thing might have had some quirky cult appeal. No hope for the patient, alas: the film is delivered on the slab smelling of formaldehyde and stinking of rot.<br /><br />That said, at the very least, \\"Secret Window\\" really made me empathize with poor crazy old John Shooter.

034537410X|5.0|Simply reading the book has been one of the best ways I have found to remember my dreams and to induce lucid dreaming.<br /><br />A reviewer noted that for some people reading the book is enough to create lucid dreams, and she is right.<br /><br />The book contains several accounts of people having a variety of experiences with dreams and dreaming, and these accounts alone make for a great reading experience.  Add to that scientific knowledge concerning the dreaming brain and mind, a variety of dreaming techniques that work, and an interesting model of how dreams come about, and you have a fascinating and useful book.<br /><br />The idea of schemas, proposed in the book, is interesting and informative.  Schemas are basically ways that information fits together in your mind based on your expectations and beliefs.  Your schemas will define what you dream about and how it is you dream about it.  The model of schemas tells us why our dreams tell us so much about ourselves in terms of what we really think and feel.  The model of schemas can also help you explain to yourself why you have certain dreams.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants to live more fully in that portion of their lives they spend asleep and dreaming.  The book helps to open up an entire realm of adventure.
B000B0WODA|3.0|When I first listened to Franz Ferdinand's first album I was in love. I was so excited for this release. Indeed, it lived up to the Franz Ferdinand sound. It's groovy, great and fun to listen to, makes you want to stand up and jump, etc. The problem I have with it is that it sounds similar, actually, the same, as their previous release. It's hard to change your sound but it's a big deal when your music sounds too similar. If you liked their first album there is no doubt that you will like this one. But, just be warned that if you're looking for something new, you won't find it.

In fact, if this had been produced as a demo by a wannabe, it would have never seen the light of day.   <br /> <br />Here's an idea--compile all of Paul's best post-Beatle work and see if it adds up to one or two good discs.  Here's another idea---compile John's, Paul's, and George's best (Ringo DQ'd).  Now there's a best seller.
B000056JYC|4.0|<br />I'll admit, I was no Frampton fan when this came out. The songs were inescapable, always on the radio, Frampton seemed to be just another \\"pretty boy\\" who seemed to have chops but was overshadowed by image, and it was too much the \\"thing to buy.\\"  <br />Well, I don't know if I've changed all my opinions about his work but I have to admit the guy owns this crowd. Even a trifle like \\"Penny for Your Thoughts\\" is met with an enthusiasm that can only be earned by the power of performance; Frampton is a sensation live, making the crowd a part of the show in a way that only a truly gifted performer can. This ability carries over into the recording where he seems to be energized by the crowd; taking their enthusiasm and using it to push his way through the rather mediocre material that he presents. The songs are not masterpieces; as other reviewers have noted, his studio recordings were never works of art, but playing live at least on this recording, elevates these songs to a higher level. Frampton has never really done anything to approach the impact of this recording but FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE is definitely one worth having, not just as piece of nostalgia but as a representation of how a concert should be captured for posterity. <br />

So those wonderful, hardworking chinese apparently went looking for other civilizations and traveled everywhere, but didn't fetch up anywhere with a written history.  They touched down briefly yet changed everything wherever they landed, all without leaving even a smidgen of actual evidence.  They were nearly miraculous in their sailing abilities and sheer resources afloat, yet they wrecked on many a shore, leaving only carved stones that might be nothing and bits of wood that might be a log.  And the only real 'evidence' for any of this are old maps, all of which are ambiguous while others are long-known forgeries.  That and Mr. Menzies assurance that he was there once in a sub, and has seen many a sea chart.   <br /> <br />I'm all about speculative history, but this book is simply too preposterous to be all that entertaining.  I have personal knowledge of only a small part of the ground Menzies covers (I'm a north american archaeologist), and virtually all of the details he mentions that I know something about are inaccurate.  I suspect sloppiness in other areas as well (visa vie the other comments left here), and I can only conclude that Menzies doesn't let facts get in the way of a good sea yarn.  This book may spur interest in an overlooked chapter of euro-centric history so it gets one star, but rarely has so much be made of so little.

B000007T2Z|5.0|Every so often an album comes around that completely shatters my mind's fragile framework and takes me over. _F#A#oo_ is an album that demands the listener's attention from the opening narrative; there is this sort of haunting drone underneath a gritty, rough voice that is speaking in an almost warm whisper. \\"It went like this,\\" and out of nowhere a transcendent violin duet takes over and the mood shifts. It changes from a story with the feeling of bleakness being told by an old man with his eyes closed and a cigar burning next to him to one of hope. Hope. \\"[...]The skyline was beautiful on fire, all twisted metal stretching upwards, everything washed in a thin, orange haze,\\" as he takes a puff of his cracked, brown cigar and exhales the sweet vapors.<br /><br />What is so stunning about this album? It's that every note is played with an immense amount of conviction and it makes for a perfectly complete body of work. The narration is woven so beautifully in with the music. It just flows, and the music accompanying works superlatively. Every passage, every string flurry or ambient drone or bass drum hit or electric guitar strum feels like it's going to explode out of the plastic confines of the disc. The buildups are captivating; it makes the listener not want to turn the page. It leaves me, at times, breathless, like I have forgotten I am a part of this world and am an object in something sublimely larger than life. It's a huge body of work that requires numerous listens to wholly understand.<br /><br />Curl up with the lights out and your favorite blanket and light a few candles and let the music consume you with the blackness. Truly wonderful and essential art.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I really liked the movie.  My husband did not care for it, but it enteratined me and enjoyed the twists and the changing stories.  I thought it was different from your everyday hollywood movie and would recommend to anyone.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I loved this movie as well as all the others. You should buy this. I can watch this over and over and never tire of it.
B000002H33|1.0|I have always maintained that THIS album was nothing more then a overpretentious, self-indulgent mastrobation fest. This group gets WAY too much credit for such mediocore cr@p such as this album and 'Ride The Lightning'. First off all for this P.O.S., you have songs on this pi$$ turkey that are over 8-minutes long, full of pointess solos and souless meandering in a banal attemp from these idiots to sound \\"complex and intelligent\\". These guys are known alcholics, how intelligent can this be? I can never understand how Mastrobation of Puppets is considered one of the best albums in metal, mainly when you hade much superior albums out in 86, such as Slayer's R.I.B., Kreator's \\"Pleasure to Kil\\" and Dark Angle's \\"Darkness Decends\\", all which make this sound like \\"NOW 18\\". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Skip right over this pile of self indugent cr@p. Kirk Hammett, way way way way way overrated, almost as overrated as \\"Dimebag\\" Darrle was, Mustaine was much better and heavier then he ever was. Hetfeild, one of the worst singers i have ever heard, 2nd to only Phil Anselmo in the \\"Worst Vocalist Known To Man\\" catagory. My next door neighbor joe could have his voice. Lar$ ul\\"RICH\\", this guy was so bad that even James Hetfeild himself has admitted this fact. The man can't drum to save his life, i'v seen better drummers in my highschool, Antarctica High, who could run circles around this dane. Then there is Cliff, who you can't even hear at all. I'm starting to think that this Cliff burton guy was some urban legend or myth started in order to make Metallica popular, was supposed to be this \\"AwEsOmE\\" bass player, yet you can't hear him at all, is this a joke of some kind? Or maybe he was just so bad that they unplugged his amp so he wouldn't be heard at all, i don't know. Cliff Burton might as well be a made up legend like the boogie-man, because no one has actually seen him (or in Cliff's case, HEARD him, hahahahahaha), we just have stories about him, and how LeGeNdArY he is. It is a very overrated Cd if you ask me, here are the ratings i gave it: <br /> <br /> \\"Battery\\" 2/10 * Wow, they wrote a song about batteries, how intelligent, i bet the energizer bunny wouln't be to happy though.* <br /> <br /> \\"Mastrobation of Puppets\\" 1/10 * It is too long and boring, and very stupid lyrics* <br /> <br /> \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" -5/10 * So bad that it  would be a waste of breath to even talk about it.* <br /> <br /> \\"Sanitaium\\" -3/10 * These guys need to be put away in a sanitarium if you ask me.* <br /> <br /> \\"Disposable Heros\\" -10/10 * Oh man, the songs just keep getting worse. This is some kind of Full-Metal Jacket  ripp-off.* <br /> <br /> \\"Leppar Messiah\\" -18/10 * Cr@ppy song with some anti religous sounding lyrics to make them look like b@d$$es.* <br /> <br /> \\"Orion\\" -1,000,000,000,000/10 * A god awful souless mastrobatory instramental.* <br /> <br /> \\"Damage\\" -1,000/10 * It is the last song of the album, which makes it the best here.* <br /> <br />     <br /> <br />Cliff, Geddy Lee walks right all over you.
B000088E6D|5.0|This young man has a great talent.  He brings back the styles of Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darrin, and Mel Torme with his own twist. I hope he will continue to mix old songs with new and bring to the younger public the great style of the past masters.
B00009RDGA|5.0|A wonderfully entertaining movie set in the 1930's in Kansas. Ryan O'Neal plays a two-bit con-man who gets roped into transporting a 9-year-old girl (played by his real-life daughter Tatum) to relatives in St. Joseph, Missouri, after her mother dies. Tatum is wise beyond her years and the two team up in scams on the road. They have their adventures and grow to love and need each other. It's a fun picture, with the '30's setting perfectly captured in music and great b&w photography. Tatum won an Oscar. Definitely worth a watch.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Unbelievable album. Is it folk? Is it bluegrass? Is it a rock musical? It is all of these and much more, and I've never been moved like this by an album before. The album deserves to be played in it's entirety, so kick back, put on a pair of headphones, and lose yourself in the \\"Sufjan Stevens Experience\\"!
B000002JNJ|1.0|From a pu$$ified Bon Jovi style glam rock band in the 80s to a half @$$ed Exhorder tribute band in the 90s, Pantera has never had an once of originality in the entire careers. They have to be the biggest gimmick in metal, if metal they be at all. One has to laugh at their HaRdCoRe b@d @$$ posturing on stage and attempt to be ToUgH in order to gain respect. Even though Pantera fans claim that these idiots are the real deal, Pantera is actaully quiet formula. Here is a step by step break down of Panteribles music:    1, Take a simple, clishe, panteribly executed 3 chord riff w/ distortion added for that \\"heavy feel\\" and play it over and over and over and over untill the song is done. It doesn't matter if you have no knowlege of chord proggresion or time changes, as Pantera fans have no knowlege of these concepts either.    2, Your vocalist should sound like one of those silver back gorillas you read about in National Geographic. It doesn't matter if he can't carry a tune of hit notes, just as long as he sounds really scary and b@d@$$. It is also important that he struts around the stage like a complete jack@$$ ToUgH GuY style to make him appear more HaRdCoRe to the fans and help push across to fans that he is not to be scr*wed with.     3, All of your song titles must have some violent, unpleasent or otherwise disturbing title such as \\"F**king Hostile\\" \\"5 Minutes Alone\\" \\"Cemetary Gates\\" or \\"Sandblasted Skin\\". How about a title like \\"Teenage-girl killer\\" or \\"Baby Destroyer\\"? yeah, those sound really scary, go with those.    4, An important step, your band must look as b@d@$$ as possible to the fans. Your image must consist of scary looking tatoos all over the body, dyed hair, chains, gotees and even more tatoos. This is important because it will show how ToUgH and HaRdCoRe you are to your fan base. Also, give each of your band members some \\"cool\\" sounding nick name like \\"Dimebag\\" or \\"Rex Rockker\\", don't be afraid to go overboard with this, Pantera certainlty didn't.5, Make sure that your guitarist gets more coverage in music magazines then Oprah and Martha Stewart get in People magazine combind. This constant coverage from the metal magazines will push across to people that this guy might actaully be good, (despite the fact he can't play at all and is no good), that way, when he dies, countless people, magazines and media \\"tribute\\" shows (Fuse) will be proclaiming this medicore guitar player \\"Legendary\\". Don't worry, guitarists today are judged by how many pedals and stomp boxes they own, and how expensive and \\"cool\\" looking their axe is, actuall skill or musical knowleged is not nessary (as exemplifed by Dimes popularity).     6, Form a even more panterible band consisting of two original members of your old band and two unknowns. This will by comparison make your old band look even better because the new band is that much worse. This will create a demand from your fan base for the \\"old\\" band to get back together, be carfull though, it might get some of you highschool drop-out IQ of 31 fans upset and cause one of them to empty a clip of 9 mm rounds at you during a preformance. \\"Dime! you BrOkEd UpEd Pantera! Arrrgggg!\\"    These steps are what essentialy make up the gimmick known as Pantera. The fact that this band has such a HaRdCorE fan base and such popularity only confirms my belive that a majority of this world must be braindead idiots incapable of thinking for themselves, conforming to whatever is popular at the moment. The death of \\"Dimebag\\" Darrle was actually a blessing in disguise, as it means no more panterible music from this panterible band. My question is this, if this guy was so great and \\"Legendary\\", why was he shot and killed by one of his own fans? The killer must of had some reason. Maybe finding out that this band/musician was a complete joke and gimmick, actually spending his hard earned cash on CDs and tickets to see this loser play, then realizing he had been competely been ripped off all of these years was enough to push him over the edge.
B000957O82|5.0|This is the first time I've ever seen Will Smith in the lead on a romantic comedy.  This was a long time in coming as he has managed to take the charcter of Alex Hitcheson and made it his own.<br /><br />This movie will offer a lot of laugh out loud moments and the relationship between Hitch and Sara is very well done.  The make-up of the cast was indeed crucial to this story and it was fun to see \\"the geek\\" (played by Kevin James) really get the girl and how Hitch (Will Smith) had to work for it.<br /><br />This really is a feel good movie and one that will entertain while at the same time not insult the viewer.

B0001EFTVA|5.0|So this is real-life anime. Wow. I'm stunned. Where Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress failed, Tokyo Godfathers greatly achieves. I loved this film. It's real-life anime with characters most of us have been at one time. We've all struggled--some to the point of being homeless. We've all had defeating family issues. And we've all wanted nothing more than to get away; this movie captures both that fantasy and that reality in one anime package.<br /><br />And the story itself is touching. How can you not feel for these homeless people as they struggle to get a child back to its rightful mother? These three very unique individuals struggle to no end, facing bodily harm, organized crime, AIDS, and a possessive father, just to get this tiny little child to a safe place, a home, where it can be loved. And all of their efforts comes across as genuine. Excellent.
B0009ZHJ82|4.0|This was really pretty interesting. Kept you guessing at what was going to happen next. Miss Berry was like always very good in the acting department. The special effects keep getting better all the time.
B00005JLSE|4.0|\\"This trial... the whole world... it's all... show business.\\"<br /><br />So says Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), a hot-shot Chicago attorney who makes his living by saving young girls who happen to have killed someone from getting the rope around their beautiful necks. And allow me to add \\"this whole movie\\" to that sentence I just quoted. In a non-derogatory manner, by the way, because \\"Chicago\\" is show business from beginning to end and that's its very soul.<br /><br />In this case, if you are a woman and want to make the front page of the newspapers, the best way seems to be killing your husband, getting caught by the cops and getting Flynn to take over your case in court. That and $5,000. The rest is, as they say, history. And rightly so because you'll go down as quickly as you went up, as soon as the girl next door does the same thing you did. Because it's Chicago, and \\"you can't beat fresh blood on the walls\\", as Flynn tells Roxie (Ren&eacute;e Zellwegger), the new kid on the block as she finds out her fifteen minutes of fame have ran out.<br /><br />My advice is that you don't go see \\"Chicago\\" looking for a whodunnit kind of thriller involving cabarets and stage dancers. Instead, if \\"Moulin Rouge\\" bringing the musical genre back to the spotlight pleased you, this one is also definitely for your liking. I'm no expert in this kind of movie (it's not even my cup of tea) and so I have a hard time figuring out whether what we have here is story interrupted by songs or songs interrupted by story.<br /><br />That duality brings an interesting quality to the film, though. Whereas the songs are full of color and splendor in good Broadway tradition, the rest is shown in bleak tones, suiting 1930's Chicago. The story however is never to be taken seriously, but always lightly. It makes sense but it is also goofy in a way.<br /><br />The acting is all great and it's no wonder because a) they're all accomplished actors and b) most have stage formation and experience. Zeta-Jones is especially hot and on the spot as Velma Kelly, as her past as a professional dancer in London really shows. I just don't know if this performance is Oscar worthy but then again that's a tricky business. Scorsese must be thinking the same thing after his \\"Gangs of New York\\" was put out to dry...nes is especially hot and on the spot as Velma Kelly, as her past as a professional dancer in London really shows.

B00005JO0J|5.0|Now I feel sorry for George Lucas.  <br /> <br />I admired him for a while, after he made the first Star Wars trilogy. They weren't brilliant but they were FUN and you walked away feeling like the people involved had the intention of doing a good job and cared enough about the audience to do their best. Then the Phantom Menace and the rest of the prequel trilogy came out and it became abundantly clear that Lucas has traded in his passion for cool computer effects and a big bank account. They may as well have been written by someone whose recreational drug of choice is Prozac.  <br /> <br />Then there's Star Trek.  <br /> <br />I used to love Star Trek too because even when an individual show was mediocre, there was some idealism and the desire to tell a though- provoking story. Then they turned a talented ensemble into bit players in the Picard and Data show. Then they misread their blind luck in casting a gorgeous voluptuous woman (Jeri Ryan) who also happens to have a brain and can ACT. And they hired a voluptuous model with no discernible personality (or acting skills) to play a Vulcan in the lame show Enterprise. So now the Star Trek franchise is on life support as well?  <br /> <br />What's left that's worth seeing? ANY damn thing that Joss Whedon does.  <br /> <br />Buffy the Vampire Slayer was brilliant. The casting was brilliant, a solid ensemble who seemed to have fun with what they were doing. The writing was outstanding. The story arcs were TIGHT and left you dying to see what would happen next. People of all kinds loved the stories without putzing around worrying that they were gaga over a damn liberal (or conservative) show. These comments apply to Angel as well.  <br /> <br />But Firefly (and now Serenity) is a completely different animal. Firefly is what you would get if Joss Whedon took ALL the right lessons from Buffy and Angel, took all the lessons learned from those projects and used them to jump his work up a level or two in quality. If he miraculously found another very talented but under appreciated ensemble cast and created compelling stories that had his fans clamoring for more. And that's clearly what happened.  <br /> <br />However, Firefly was cancelled WAY to early, due to network idiocy that's clearly more interested in milking lots of money without creating good stories. \\"Why spend money when we can get the public to waste their time watching reality TV?\\"  <br /> <br />Fortunately, Joss Whedon has had a shot at bringing back Firefly this past week as the feature film Serenity.  <br /> <br />I have to admit, I was worried that the story would be too aimed at pleasing Firefly fans, to the point that newbies seeing it wouldn't get a good story out of it. It wasn't. Several friends seeing it with no prior exposure to Firefly have asked how they missed such an amazing show.  <br /> <br />I was prepared to sit down to a \\"pretty good\\" movie and settling for that.  <br />It wasn't. It was so freaking amazing, so damn good that I left the theater almost in shock, that my first words posted after seeing it kept talking about it being made to such a high standard that my nose would probably be bleeding for hours. Whedon outdid himself. The cast was tremendously enjoyable, the dialogue sharp and witty, the story compelling. I was on the edge of my seat for most of it. I was gut punched and blindsided and dazzled and had the time of my life.  <br /> <br />This movie was so freaking good that I saw it twice in two days and can't wait to see it with another friend, later this week. I haven't been that bowled over and thrilled by a movie since the first Star Wars movie.  <br />And that's why I feel sorry for George Lucas. He'll never do that again.  <br /> <br />He may have many times more money than Joss Whedon but Lucas will never craft a story a fraction as good as the original Star Wars (which now seems mundane and idiotic compared to Firefly/Serenity) again for as long as he lives. He may make more movies but his good work is all over 20 years old.  <br /> <br />Whedon's career is still very young, he's accomplished and he's shown that he wants to keep creating better work, not to create a franchise he can milk just to fill a bank account.  <br /> <br />Thank you, Joss Whedon.
B000AU9UYW|4.0|I have seen all the Batman movies and they just keep getting better and better. Wish that the producers could have thought ahead and had them in order. Don't you think it would have been nice to see \\"Batman Begins\\" in the first place rather than last? Holy smokes don't they know from start to finish? Acting was good and story line likewise. Only one question. Where do we go from here?
B00005ATQF|3.0|\\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is a movie that seems to be clearly divided in two different pieces. The first runs for the initial forty minutes and it promises a lot. The second runs for the remainder of the feature and it doesn't really deliver what it promised before.<br /><br />For one thing, the film looks great all the way through. The scenery is awesome, be it the Vietnamese landscapes or the geography of the training camp at Parris Island. Douglas Milsome does an excellent cinematography work in \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" which was only his second job in that capacity. The soundtrack is minimalistic but it works quite well, never outstaying its presence.<br /><br />Vincent D'Onofrio and Lee Ermey are absolutely spot on during the first part of the movie. Ermey plays the gunnery sergeant who spends about 95% of his waking hours shouting his guts to the marines under his supervision. D'Onofrio, as Private Pyle, was unlucky enough to be in that platoon in the first place, as he gets picked on by the sergeat and becomes the laughing stock of the platoon. Except no one laughs. Instead they hate him, because everyone pays for whatever he does wrong. Pyle's mind starts to downspiral and from there what happens is anybody's guess.<br /><br />The second part of the movie has nothing to do whatsoever with the first, except for a couple of linked threads. It all becomes fragmented like short pieces carelessly put together and we find ourselves entrenched in a war zone with a group of marines but not really caring much about them. Not like we cared about Pyle anyway.<br /><br />\\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is excellent for those first 40 minutes which contain one of the best scenes ever shot. The rest is a good, albeit regular Vietnam movie, which doesn't really bring anything new with it and certainly doesn't do it better than other films like \\"Apocalypse Now\\" or \\"The Deer Hunter\\" before it. It just doesn't seem to be in the \\"must-see\\" category as far as Kubrick's catalogue is concerned.
B0006L16N8|4.0|This is a well done CD.  Coldplay has such unique sound and the lyrics are great.  The band continues to grow and produce great music with meaning.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|By the time my husband had heard good reviews on \\"Firefly\\" and decided to watch it, it was cancelled.  I'm not a Fox fan, and rarely watch them, so it was easy to miss.  We heard the buzz about \\"Serenity\\" and went to see it when it opened.  I was blown away.  I am so tired of predictable sci-fi and we have been disappointed by most of the recent films.  Not with this one. After seeing \\"Serenity\\", I immediately bought the \\"Firefly\\" DVD set and have not stopped talking about them since.  I love this crew.  I love this universe.  My most frequent comment when watching the episodes was, \\"I can't believe this was on network television\\".  I can only hope this gets picked up again as a series, or that more movies follow.  Having seen  \\"Serenity\\" before \\"Firefly\\", some of the events of \\"Serenity\\" didn't have the impact on me that they would now.  I love ALL of the characters, but I especially love how different they all are and how this helps them complement each other. I was an original Trekker, but I'm a Browncoat now!

B000003TA4|5.0|One thing I could never understand over the years is how so many people dispise this album. Nevermind is one of the greatest albums of the 90's, if not the greatest. Yeah, it's overrated, as many people call Nirvana as a whole, but that doesn't mean the album isn't genius. Just about every track on this CD is a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />The album starts off with \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", which started the alternative revolution. Everything underground came up and was called as grunge. The song is a powerhouse, but every Nirvana fan will tell you it's not their best. Nirvana has better songs on Bleach (\\"Love Buzz\\"), Incesticide (\\"Sliver\\"), and In Utero (\\"Serve the Servants\\") Kurt Cobain got so fed up with the song, as it was so overrated when people came to their concerts that's all they wanted to hear, that he eventually stopped playing it live. (IMO he also wrote \\"Rape Me\\" because of it) Not to mention the \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" performance on The Muddy Banks of Wishkah is much better.  <br /> <br />\\"In Bloom\\" the song written about the guys who sing their songs but 'don't know what it means.' The song is another Nirvana classic and the music video is amazing (not the sub pop one) <br /> <br />\\"Come As You Are\\" has one of Nirvana's classic riffs, even if Kurt Cobain did steal it from Killing Joke. (Although Nirvana's last drummer Dave Grohl did make it up to them by playing on one of their albums)  <br /> <br />\\"Breed\\" is one of my favorites off Nevermind. The song is lightning fast with great vocals.  <br /> <br />\\"Lithium\\" is one of the first Nirvana songs most people hear. The song has a guitar riff that is simply genius and I still get creeped out when I hear the chorus (even if he is only saying 'Yeah') <br /> <br />\\"Polly\\" is a song that grows on you. The song details the story of a 14-year-old girl that was kidnapped and raped. When you first hear it you'll wonder why they put it on the album as it is much slower then the previous songs. Similiar to Stairway to Heaven, once you listen to it a few times you'll realize how great it is. And if you don't, then just listen to the faster \\"(New Wave) Polly\\" on Incesticide.  <br /> <br />\\"Territorial Pissings\\" is a song that even the Nevermind haters can like. The song is very similiar to Breed with Cobain screaming about finding a \\"better way.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Drain You\\" is a really underrated Nirvana song. I consider the second best song on the album and it's simply amazing.  <br /> <br />\\"Lounge Act\\" is another underrated song which I believe is a perfect song. Although just about everyone won't agree with me, it is the greatest song on the album, if not the greatest by Nirvana. (Although \\"Sappy\\", \\"Where Did you Sleep Last Night?\\" and \\"Do Re Mi\\" come very close) The lyrics are amazing, with Kurt singing about being constrained in a relationship. Apparently Kurt's singing to a guy that was cheating on his girlfriend but interestingly the original lyrics say \\"I'll go out of my way to prove I still smell him on you\\" instead of \\"her on you\\" which completely changes the meaning of the song.  <br /> <br />\\"Stay Away\\" is another song comparible to Breed. It's very fast with Dave doing \\"Bonzo\\" triplets on the drums. However the original song, named \\"Pay to Play\\", which is in the box set has a better sound.  <br /> <br />\\"On a Plain\\" is an excellent song with some of Nirvana's best lyrics (I'll start this off without any words/I got so high I scratched till I bled/ I love myself better than you/ I know it's wrong so what should I do?) Although personally I prefer the MTV Unplugged version, this is great as well. <br /> <br />\\"Something in the Way\\" along with \\"Polly\\" is a song that grows on you. It's a really soothing song that demonstrates Kurt Cobain's genius as a songwriter. He didn't have to scream to have a classic song.  <br /> <br />This is probably one of the only albums I own that I'd give every song a perfect score. Nirvana, Nevermind, and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" changed music history. Without Nirvana and the grunge revolution there wouldn't be a lot of the bands that exist today. So please, before bashing the album as Nirvana's \\"Selling Out\\" album, listen to it without bias and your personal dislike of everything mainstreamed. (I hate Courtney Love more than I hate Good Charlotte but I still think \\"Live Through This\\" is an amazing album.) <br /> <br />
B0006SSOHC|2.0|A great many people, it would appear, hold the film \\"Saw\\" in high regard. It was at the behest of numerous co-workers and friends that I finally ran out with my spouse and snagged a rental of this rather curious title. While I can certainly credit the film for taking a fresh route so completely unorthodox and visually arresting, I still must conclude that I found the whole thing rather lacking. <br /> <br />The concept of two people struggling to solve the puzzle of why they were abducted and squared away together with the threat of death looming over their heads could, and should, have been handled with far greater care and intelligence. Having already seen David Fincher's far superior \\"Seven,\\" I could not bring myself to connect with anything this film had to offer. It was nothing more than a carbon-copy of so many other better films and didn't really seem to have any valid point. I think that is what hurts this film the most, aside from the fact that Danny Glover and Cary Elwes were totally miscast. The writing, in some areas, is so bad that you wonder how the script was ever approved. Key points in the film offer golden opportunities for Glover's character to end Jigsaw's murderous campaign. But he winds up dropping the ball in a manner no real authority figure ever would. The ending is a particular disappointment, because it foolishly leaves the door wide open for a highly unnecessary sequel when it honestly didn't have to. <br /> <br />\\"Saw\\" does have a good concept, like I said. But the overall execution of the material left me cold and frustrated. To this moment, I still do not understand why it receives such over-rated hype. To each their own, I suppose.
B0000029GA|5.0|Often cited as one of the best hip-hop albums of the '90s Let Alone All Time , Illmatic is the undisputed classic upon which Nas' reputation rests. It helped spearhead the artistic renaissance of New York hip-hop in the post-Chronic era, leading a return to street Movement. Yet even if Illmatic marks the beginning of a shift away from Native Tongues-inspired alternative rap, it's strongly rooted in that sensibility. For one, Nas employs some of the most sophisticated jazz-rap producers around: Q-Tip, Pete Rock, DJ Premier, and Large Professor, who underpin their intricate loops with appropriately tough beats. But more importantly, Nas takes his place as one of hip-hop's greatest street poets -- his rhymes are highly literate, his raps superbly fluid regardless of the size of his vocabulary. He's able to evoke the bleak reality of ghetto life without losing hope or forgetting the good times, which become all the more precious when any day could be your last. As a narrator, he doesn't get too caught up in the darker side of life But Thas What U gotta Like Best he's simply describing what he sees in the world In The Tough Streets around him, and trying to live it up while he can. He's thoughtful but ambitious, announcing on \\"N.Y. State of Mind\\" that \\"I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death,\\" which too me and alotta hip hop fans is the most famous line in hip hop culture today. and also -  that he's \\"out for dead presidents to represent me\\" on \\"The World Is Yours.\\" Elsewhere, he flexes his storytelling muscles on the classic cuts \\"Life's a Bitch\\" and \\"One Love,\\" the latter a detailed report to a close friend in prison about how allegiances within their group have shifted. Hip-hop fans accustomed to 73-minute opuses sometimes complain about Illmatic's brevity, but even if it leaves you wanting more, it's also one of the few '90s rap albums with absolutely no wasted space. See there is only 10 tracks but the illest 10 tracks ever recorded and like i said theresNO WASTED SPACE  Illmatic is a great lyricall Album, in top form, meeting great production, and it remains a perennial favorite among serious Rap Fans And Too This Day Now 2005 Is Still Too many the greatest hip hop album of not only the 90's but of all-time That says it all right there. and me born and raised and still livin in queens knows that evryword nas spits about the harsh reality of the queens blocks are all 100% true and what makes it all so much better.    My Top 5   1. NY State OF Mind  2. Tho World Is Yours  3. Aint Hard To Tell  4. One Time 4 Your Mind  5. Lifes A Bitch
B000AL730O|5.0|This album is fantastic from beginning to end. It sounds just like a classic Beatles' album and infact it is better than some of them. I don't see why some reviewers think that this album sounds so different. It sounds like \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Abbey  Road.\\" If you don't like those albums then you won't like this one. If you like those then this is exactly what you're looking for. It is way better then \\"Band On The Run\\" which sounds very  seventies and dated. This is Paul's best solo album!    I wonder how many of these one star reviewers could write even one song  half as good as any of the ones on this album.
B00005MEW1|3.0|Nosferatu is one of the first two horror movies I ever bought.  I still have that videotape, with a soundtrack by Clubfoot Orchestra. <br /> <br />It's a great movie with some images that are still pretty haunting, if not quite scary, today.  The best DVDs in terms of image quality and extras for NTSC Region 1 are probably the ones by Kino and by Image. <br /> <br />As silent movie aficionados say, silent movies weren't really \\"silent,\\" having pretty much always been accompanied by an organist or small orchestra.  To this day there are still revivals of Nosferatu with live accompaniment, particularly around Halloween. <br /> <br />It can be interesting to listen to different musicians' ideas of what appropriate accompaniment might be.  Apart from the various videotape and DVD releases of Nosferatu, which usually feature some sort of original score (though occasionally with \\"canned\\" classical music haphazardly applied), a number of artists have recorded soundtracks for Nosferatu which they have released separately.  You would have to synchronize the audiocassette or CD with your videotape or film of the movie.  I remember seeing some reviewed and/or advertised in the music magazine Alternative Press. <br /> <br />The first version of it I had watched that had a gothic music soundtrack was the DVD Nosferatu: The First Vampire with music by Type O-Negative.  It's not bad.  I just watched this one, Nosferatu: A Gothic Industrial Mix (Nosferatu: A Tale of Gothic Horror as the opening titles have it) with \\"music by Rozz Williams of Christian Death and Electric Hellfire Club.\\"  Again, not bad.  I'm not very familiar with gothic music.  Stylistically, it can vary pretty widely, sounding similar to rock, or techno, or heavy metal, etc.  The music for the \\"Gothic Industrial Mix\\" is more what I would describe as ambient.  Most of it is pretty relaxing music one could fall asleep to, if so inclined.  Though primarily instrumental, occasionally there are voices as either vocalsor vocal samples. <br /> <br />Cleopatra Home Video did add opening and end titles to the movie.  The intertitles (aka title cards) are not theirs, but are from whatever print of the film they used.  Curiously, their opening titles give the actors' names beside the character names from the original German version (Count Orlok, Hutter, Knock, etc.).  However, the DVD rear box cover and the intertitles use the names of the characters from Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, of which this was an unauthorized adaptation.  Those intertitles originate evidently with an American re-release of Nosferatu, but how long ago they were created, I'm not sure - but Cleopatra is not at fault for them. <br /> <br />The print of the film used is not bad, probably on par with other inexpensive public domain releases of the movie.  It features the usual faults, such as the top of Nosferatu's head being cropped off when he stands bolt upright in his coffin. <br /> <br />The DVD has no extras except for a chapter selection.  As with a number of DVDs whose menus feature only two options (\\"play movie\\" and \\"scene selection\\"), the selected option is a different color than the deselected one.  However, unless you know which color is the color used for highlighting, it's impossible to know which is selected!  In such cases, it's better to have an icon appear next to the selected option.
B0002IVN9W|2.0|I was recommended this album by Amazon, and read all the great reviews, so figured I'd give it a shot.  So I get it yesterday, throw it in...and man, it's bad.  Not awful, but just bad.  The rifts are decent - reminds me a bit of Neutral Milk Hotel - but the lead singer is just awful.  Just thinking about his voice gives me a migraine.  In the end, I'm going to go against the grain and say move on.
B0002I831S|5.0|The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1400 minutes per box, you are looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is beautiful. Make sure to retain the cardboard holder that it sits into as this helps stability on the shelf (although the box can still stand alone the bottom is a little narrow). The shell cracks open down the centre to reveal a box. Sliding out of the box is a small booklet insert with discs in a well designed plastic holder that flip from disc to disc. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 8 discs in total. However the last disc, disc 8, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 30 episodes. The rest of disc 8 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. Several of the shows come with a commentary. All the episodes have been remastered to the point that scratches and artefacts are hardly visible. The special effects have been touched up slightly (no strings), however they still retain an overall early look and feel, especially the initial episodes that have budget restrictions. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.<br /><br />Star Trek, The Original Series (TOS), Season One, is a fine example of the growing stages of any television series. Viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed shows the vision shaping. Spock is the only character to be retained from the pilot episode `The Cage'. Kirk appears after this one. Chekov does not appear until Season Two. Yeoman Smith appears in quite a number of Season One episodes before retiring from the show. The little known Nurse Chapel also appears here as well as the other series. The Enterprise itself is a mere hunk of plastic that does not improve much until Season Two and is funny to see. There are very little space shots in Season One because of the limitations of visual effects. The main viewer of The Bridge looks like a projector screen and is avoided much of the time. When something does appear there it looks completely phoney... and funny. Spock's makeup design goes through a few changes. However, even though we can laugh at much of Season One now, the series does gel and soon we have some fascinating sci-fi theory and execution, even though what we are watching is the equivalent of a stage play. Nobody can critic the quality of the television acting and not since Flash Gordon had the world seen anything like it before. The stories (mostly by DC Fontana) are slightly narrow in their field of vision, however these where to mature in later seasons. Season One of TOS is mostly about alien illusions, shape shifters, psi-power, viruses, alternative universes, intergalactic slavery, military trials, deities, time travel and close hand to hand combat with aliens. There is also the unforgettable award winning `The City on the Edge of Forever' starring Joan Collins. `Operation: Annihilate!' has the flying face huggers type creatures that the movie `Alien' ripped off. Kahn appears in this series. We have both Klingons and Romulans also. The classic `Devil in the Dark' sees Kirk and Spock fight an underground cave monster. Kirk goes hand to hand with a giant reptile in the episode `Arena'. Surprisingly enough very few episodes actually contain all the characters at one time, including Sulu and Scotty.  This does not happen until Season Two and then occurs often in Season Three. In TOS Season One characters are sort of alternated from episode to episode. The bottom line for TOS: Season One is that it is a classic. Although it is not necessarily the best of the Seasons, it works well as a very good foundational study for Trekkies who will absolutely adore seeing the variations in design and theme. All in all this is the funny season for 21st century viewers. You are supposed to laugh at this one more than thinking about its topics. And what a laugh it is! Just watch Kirk roll about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume. How can you not want that!however these where to mature in later seasons.

Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.<br /><br />Star Trek, The Original Series (TOS), Season Two, starts to get a budget based on the ratings of TOS Season One. The Enterprise has undergone a new design and looks more than just a hunk of plastic hanging from a string... although not by much. The Bridge looks bigger with more components and consoles. Chekov, who was not in Season One, makes his first appearance here. Season Two has more space shots and attempts are made to film the Enterprise making manoeuvres. Costumes are brushed up a bit, but Kirk's new green sweater might attract some debate. The intro credits have an irritating *ding* sound every few seconds. Both the Green sweater and the *ding* are done away with in Season Three. Apart from a few questionable episodes the series does takeoff in the right direction. There is an instalment with the character Dr. Zefram Cochrane who appears in the movie First Contact. There are themes of rapid aging, furry pets, alien abduction, telepathy, Nazis, advanced computers and time travel. Scotty appears more often than usual. We are introduced into our first space station that looks like pre-deep space nine. The alien costumes are given a sprucing up. In one episode there is a gathering of about twelve various life forms. The big plus side is in the quality of the dialogue between the characters. Spock and Bones go at one another more often. There is tension on deck as well as post-mayhem humour and analysis. At the end of each episode Kirk usually makes a statement to round up the day's affairs. They even crack a joke or two. It is worth it for the episodes \\"Trouble with Tribbles\\" and \\"Patterns of Force\\", along with being an important instalment for any collector's series. The main thing you will like about Season Two is the improved interaction between the characters. The camera also pans and dollies more, with lots of handheld making the visuals less static than in Season One. The credits and end credits also undergo a revamp, including titles that appear as the episode starts and ends and not just along with the music. There is lots of experimentation and improvement here that has since stood the test of time. The budget boost was certainly worth it.often.

B00074C4DA|5.0|This band, The Mars Volta has to be the most amazing band I have heard in a long time. Certaintly the best band to come along in my life-time. The amazing genra bending sounds this band creates blow my mind. It's Santana meets Yes meets Aerosmith with a splash of James Brown in the live show. When I first discovered this band it was as a System Of A Down concert and The Mars Volta was opening and when they came on they blew me away, with the amazing vocals and soaring guitar and the Latin flavor I thought this band was the greatest thing since sliced bread. They most deffinatley put on a better show then System Of A Down did that night.<br /><br />Frances The Mute apart from having a cool album cover is one of the best albums to come out in a long time. On paper Prog-ish-rock and Latin music and hard rock all at once dont sound to apealing, or maybe they do, but when The Mars Volta mixes them together on this album it is nothing short of pure stroke of genius. The album opens with a ten minute jam which is absolutley amazing. This song reminds me a lot of mid 1970's Rush, except sung in Spanish. The albums only radio friendly song, 'The Widow,' track two is amazing. The lyrics are compelling and the vocals are nothing short of amazing. But the real magic on this album is the next song, 'LVia LViaquez.' This song is just, just perfect. No flaws on this track. The opening guitar solo is killer, I think John Frushanti and Flea of The Red Hot Chili Peppers plays on this song except Flea plays trumpet, which is really cool. The vocal delivery on this song is jsut amazing. The song is about ten minutes long but I'm telling you its nothing to get bored with, the changing tempos and varied instraments keep this song interesting, and not to mention the absolutley out of this world vocals. I just wish I new what he was saying when he sings in Spanish, but I think that mystery adds to why this band is so damn cool. The rest of the album is amazing as well, The problem is that I cant really tell you how each song is because of the way they are titled and numbered it's kind of confusing. But trust me the rest of the album is just as good as the beggining.<br /><br />For anyone who is looking for a band that is different and not just like every other band out right now then The Mars Volta is a great alternative and is really a band that will always keep you guessing. If you heard 'The Widow' on the radio I am warning you that on this album that's the only song that sounds like that, the rest of the album is totaly different.

B000002J1M|5.0|always provacative, endlessly challenging and ultimately beautiful, Foxtrot stands as one of the crown jewels in the back catalogue of Genesis. the production captures the essence of these songs down to the shimmering whispers and strangely heroic melodies. \\"Supper's Ready\\" is not just one of this band's finest songs, but a monumental piece of music that is a prog rock classic!
B00000AFGM|5.0|I get more into Manson everytime I listen to his stuff, It's really awesome and dark stuff. Mechanical Animals hooks me the hole way through with heavy in your face songs to mellow dark songs. A great album touring the limits of industrial and goth music. This album is tied for my favorite of Manson along with Holy Wood. Great mix of songs throughout, never looses my attention. The same can't be said about AntiChrist Superstar though, even though that too is an awesome album. Mechanical Animals just moves me from start to finish. Every song is really good. This is the album that got me to like his music even more then I did, because its some of the most intense industrial music you'll ever hear. He reminds me of a cross between NIN and Alice Cooper. Industrial, Goth, Glam, Metal, Freak show, Controversial, Scary, Sad, Intense, Marylin Manson. This is truly a great album by Manson. Any nonfan of Manson who stays away from his music because of his controversy should give him a chance, because you might actually like his music a lot if you actually listen to it. If the lyrics scare you, then just rock out and be moved to the actual brilliant music behind it.

0312305060|4.0|Some people found this book painful or boring but I thought it was a very well-crafted story that was beautifully told and evoked a number of universal human emotions we can all identify with, especially fear and uncertainty as we get older. There were some beautiful scenes and imagery in the book, and while once in a while it bordered on the pretentious, it didn't feel at all contrived, it felt genuine.  I found it very readable and very interesting and wasn't bored for a second.  And I haven't even read Woolf.  Of course it made me want to, because it was amazing to read a story about women's lives linked through literature, which I think is a great theme.  I didn't find it dark or depressing either, although I know a lot of people did.  <br /> <br /> I felt it was thoughtful, respectful of its characters too.  It was a quiet book that didn't bludgeon you with its messages but let them emerge with subtlety-everything happens within a day's time, which is quite an achievement because it gives you a real sense of a more substantial passage of time spent with these three women, whose inner lives are fascinating.  It isn't about action, it's about the internal world of the heart. <br /> <br />Definitely recommended, I think most anyone would enjoy it.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Sigur Rs is great, and this album was the first I heard of them.  I'll be short and sweet.  If I listen to these songs while I'm sad, they're sad songs.  If I listen to them while I'm happy, they're happy and hopeful.  Good band.  Good CD.  Buy it.  Listen to it.

Be sure to bring a box of tissues along when you watch this movie.  The ending will make you cry every single time!!  I highly recommend this movie to those who are looking for a wholesome story for the entire family to watch.

On paper that might sound like a Weird Al Yankovic album, but in actuality it's an album crammed with timeless themes of love, and beauty, and regret, and death, and the value of appreciating life, and being strong.  The robot thing is fun, but in the end it's almost incidental.<br /><br />It's the songs, the songs.  The songs!  Oceans of strings, choirs of aliens, sampled crowd sounds sort of used as an instrument, audio from robot battles, Stephen Drozd's whacked-out experimental drums, and whole tunes sampled from other artists (whether The Flaming Lips will admit it or not) and completely reinvented.<br /><br />Every time you listen to this album it gets better.  It's a masterpiece that no amount of scrutiny will ever completely analyze.  It's beautiful.  Songs like \\"Do You Realize?\\" are soft and gorgeous enough to sing as lullabies to your baby, while songs like \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots\\" could be called experimental punk.<br /><br />If you don't already own this album, you need to sort out your priorities in life.  Somewhere, you're spending fourteen dollars that could be better spent here.  Make the changes needed; buy this album; rock out accordingly.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Best MTV movie of all time. Funny and smart, very Wes Anderson style. Long live to Napoleon Dynamite! <br />PS. Vote for Pedro.
B00004VVNB|4.0|I'D NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE, BUT REMEMBERED HEARING ABOUT IT WHEN IT CAME OUT WHEN I WAS A KID, SO I KNEW I WAS TAKING A CHANCE BY BUYING IT ON DVD. I WAS ESPECIALLY PREPARED TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY THE FACT IT HAD NEVER BEEN CLOSE TO ATTAINING STARDOM AS MOONRAKER, STAR WARS OR EVEN THE BLACK HOLE HAD, WHICH SEEMED TO SAY IT WAS BOUND TO BE LOUSY. WELL, WHADDAYAKNOW, IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD; THE PLOT WAS INTERESTING, THE SOMETIMES OBVIOUS SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE FAR FROM RIDICULOUS GIVEN THE MOVIE'S AGE, AND I FOUND MYSELF CONSTANTLY SURPRISED AT MY OWN GROWING INTEREST IN THE MOVIE. SOME SO-CALLED FUTURISTIC MOVIES ARE SO STUPID YOU HATE THE PRODUCERS FOR HAVING TAKEN YOU FOR A BOZO BY MARKETING SUCH CRAP, AND MANAGING TO CON YOU OUT OF THE THEATER TICKET YOU SPENT PRECIOUS MONEY ON (INDEPENDANCE DAY, F'R INSTANCE); IN THIS CASE, I THOUGHT IT WAS SAD I'D NEVER COME AROUND TO VIEWING THIS MOVIE BEFORE. OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU'RE UNDER 20, YOU'LL PROBABLY NOT CATCH ON UNLESS YOU'RE INTO WEIRD OR DESUET MOVIES, NOT HI-TECH SPACERS. PEOPLE OVER THAT AGE, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO WERE YOUNG IN THE '70s WILL FIND IT A NOSTALGIA BOOSTER. I PLACE IT AMONG THE IMPORTANT MOVIES OF THE '70s; THOSE I'LL WANT TO MAKE SURE MY KIDS SEE...
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Love this movie.  It is witty & fun.  I never tire of it.
0440234743|5.0|I couldn't help but love reading this exciting page turner, written by John Grisham. I was addicted to the story and its amazing twists and turns. I usually don't read as much as i should, but this book really kept me anxious as to what the next page had printed on it. From the suicide of millionaire, Troy Phelan, through Nate O'Riley's jungle adventure, i never missed a page in this astonishing novel. An excellent read!
B00009XITP|4.0|Just a very nice and sweet fairy tale set in modern day England. One your children will love and the whole family will enjoy. A movie that can be watched many times without getting bored.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is hands down one of the best sci-fi shows of all time.  I despise FOX for taking this off the air.  there are so many wretched shows on tv, but this one gets taken off?  ridiculous!  You will not regret buying this dvd series, it is simply an amazing show!
B0000041A9|5.0|I've enjoyed this recording for years.  In the Sonatas, Rostropovich's cello is strong and the difficulty of having the cello and the piano together is remedied wholly by Richter's capable, modulated keyboarding.  I especially love the second movement (Rondo) of Sonata No. 2 in G minor.  (I suspect that the recording engineers also played their part.)  The Sonatas sound as though they were recorded in a large, empty hall.  Perfect.<br /><br />Yet nothing can be taken from Gendron's cello performances in the Variations.  Amazing depths in Variations on \\"Bei Mannern, welche Liebe fuhlen\\"! (He's also performed quite a bit of Bach out there.) Jean Francaix is the pianist in these performances and I especially enjoyed his parts in 12 Variations on \\"Ein Madchen oder Weibchen\\" based on Mozart.  The Variations have more of a \\"chamber\\" feel as recorded.<br /><br />In short, turn off all distractions, grab your favorite soothing beverage, lower the lights, and let this recording ease what ails you.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series is one of the best portrayals of WW2 ever put on film. They stayed true to the original story and the veterans personal stories, and the series was very good as authenticity goes as well. It really draws you in and attaches you to the men of Easy company, so that by the final episode, it is really sad to hear what happened to some of them after the war.
0930289528|3.0|This is another brilliant Alan Moore story and I'm glad I read it before seeing the upcoming film. My only issue with the product is the newsprint-like paper it's printed on. For the price, I thought I was getting a better quality paper that won't yellow inside of a couple of years.
B0006Z2LH4|5.0|I have seen all three cube movies.<br /><br />And all three of them are awesome for the same reason.<br /><br />People get killed by a machine in a grisly fashion. And in several different ways.<br /><br />And they fall back to their basest of malevolent instincts while doing so.<br /><br />So exquisite and alluring.<br /><br />Of course the series would have been better if the machine killed its creators instead of innocents.<br /><br />Or possibly even government officials or leaders of nations.<br /><br />Or even extremely wealthy people.<br /><br />It would have been fascinating to see how a formerly 'powerful' individual would attempt to escape death only to be eliminated like everyone else.<br /><br />Wishful thinking.<br /><br />Nonetheless all three movies I can watch over and over again.<br /><br />Might build my own 'Cube'.

B000929AJQ|5.0|Listening to Trent Reznor is an auditory journey through the personal and disturbing troubles of a lifetime. Pretty Hate Machine filled our ears with the sonic noise of youthful angst and hormonal aggression. With The Downward Spiral, we were treated to some of the stark realities of adulthood. Now With Teeth brings home the grey landscape of the midlife crisis and the waking up to the knowledge of sacrificed dreams. <br /> <br />If you have ever felt like another cog in the corporate machine, or simply awakened after several years to find that the youthful visions you have planned for your life have melted into the mundane, then Trent has something to say to you. <br /> <br />Wrap the tracks in any variation of style you want be it 80's techno, industial or pop-gothic and you will still find the lyrics are what will always give Trent Reznor a place in my play list. <br /> <br />As for those that comment on Reznor's constant lyrical themes of depression and angst sounding unconvincing given his finacial success, I believe he understands the truth that money and fame does not guarantee happiness and fullfillment.
B000AA305M|1.0|I heard some of this CD on a morning NPR program and notated the name David Gray so that I could then go to Amazon to listen more carefully and decide whether I wanted to buy it. I only notate things I am truly interested in buying. But since I can't even re-listen to a few seconds of any of the tracks. And can't make copies so that I can listen at work, I am sadly not going to proceed. I'm sure that the copy protection situation will mean less revenue for David Gray rather than more and am sorry that I can't find out more about this artist whose name I was unfamiliar with and now will continue to be unfamiliar with.
B0007TKG8U|5.0|This was a great blast of rock sugar from a bunch of teenage dreamers. They armed themselves with guitars, a DIY work ethic, and began bashing out three chord ditties about girls, cars, guys they were jealous of, girls and more girls. (And Mars Bars.) Whatever they may have lacked in experience, they more than made up for in exuberance. Feargel Sharkey had a voice that just boiled over with hormonal confusion and cockiness, and was so unique that no-one's matched him since. The rest of the band just tore into their instruments with all the speed that their systems' race through adolescent upheaval could keep up with. And while many slogged them off as non-political kids in punk's nihilist rage, The Undertones probably had a greater impact than most of the angry messengers of the era. Why, you may ask?<br /><br />Because The Undertones inherently understood that \\"Teenage Kicks\\" and its never distant parallel of teenage pain never fade from the scope of human existence, but momentary anger of and rage at the times usually does. Well, then again, maybe they didn't at the time. But this music still means more today than most of, say, Stiff Little Fingers or Gang of Four's library. And let's face it, there was only one Clash. Seeing as most of The Undertones were under 18 at the time of their first album, \\"The Undertones\\" subject matter of \\"She's a Run Around\\" probably weighed in heavier on their lives than \\"Julie's In The Drug Squad.\\"<br /><br />It's that kind of joyous carousing that keeps \\"The Undertones\\" from ever once sounding like less than a rock and roll epiphany. My only real quibble is the cover art (I miss the colorful high angle shot; the drab picture used here siphons off the fun feeling of the album I originally owned). Along with the first three Ramones albums, The Undertones' first two albums are a cheering jolt of electricity from a period when you could still pick up a guitar and feel like you could say whatever was on your mind. Even if the priority topic was \\"Let's Talk About Girls.\\"ty topic was \\"Let's Talk About Girls.\\" <br />
0316172324|5.0|I have to say that I believe Malcolm Gladwell has really done something here.  I think BLINK is a great follow up (and better read) to The Tipping Point, and I didn't think he could outdo himself as I loved that book as well.<br /><br />BLINK gives so many great examples into unconscious decision making.  I think it is extremely insightful as to why certain things happen the way they do.  His fantastic examples of Doctor Patient lawsuit as it relates to the level of rapport has massive practicality to helping Medical Schools prepare doctors to be people-centered first rather than the somewhat obtuse and cold approach many doctors take today.  When rapport is built, patients feel more comfortable to share \\"real\\" symptoms, real fears and doctors can anticipate their required course of care better when they are relating to the patient as a person, not a patient and his/her illness.<br /><br />The book is packed full of useful content that will have you thinking which I believe all books should make you do.  I would recommend this book without a doubt!

B000A0GP0Y|3.0|If you don't know the original with Burt Reynolds, while not a horrible movie, this movie still has a big problem:  Adam Sandler is simply too small with too non-athletic a physique to be believable as an MVP quarterback from the NFL.  When the original came out in 1974, a six foot quarterback was still believable and the six foot eight giants of today were still rare.  Nowadays, someone who is five foot ten is simply too small except as a running back or a wide receiver.<br /><br />That aside, the movie does take a few twists from the original.  Some are good and some make the movie quite ridiculous.  I like the fact that the football to the groin is thrown at a crooked ref rather than a player.  One change I thought was particularly weak was making the idea of the guards playing the prisoners something new.  In the original it was something that happened every year, but the prisoners were simply beat up and the \\"superstar\\" was there to give them an edge.  Here, the quarterback is supposed build a team from nothing to a semi-pro quality team in a month.  I don't think so.  Another thing, Eddie Albert as the warden in the original is a lot more sinister than the mean but feckless James Cromwell is in this version.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is about as raucous for our time as the original was for its.  However, the murder of caretaker is less gruesome and shocking in this remake than it was in the original.  If you want to watch Adam Sandler in a fairly mindless movie, this is OK.  However, if you want the better telling of this story, go rent the original 1974 movie with Burt Reynolds.
0060872675|4.0|No, despite being a product of Terry Pratchett's imagination, I didn't 'love' this one, but it worked well on several levels.<br /><br />As a kid's book:  Taking this one up against a tough audience, a remarkably intelligent and precocious 4-yr old girl, it did very well.  She was able to follow the idea of a dad reading a book to his child as the theme of the book, and clearly understood that Dad (in the book) was taking liberties with the text.  And that Mom caught Dad taking liberties with the book went over very well (the girl involved laughed so hard she nearly threw up).  The illustrations were a big hit with the young lady, and she was particularly taken with the pet dragons.<br /><br />As an addendum to \\"Thud!\\", by the same author.  It works, but not quite as well.  There is a new artist illustrating \\"Where's My Cow?\\", and this artist's style doesn't (I feel) work as well for DiscWorld characters.  \\"Where's My Cow\\" is fairly central to \\"Thud\\", so to see the book it self was somewhat rewarding, but a strict rendition of \\"Where's my Cow\\" would have been fairly lame.  So liberties were taken to make it more appealing to a general audience and for parents to read to children.<br /><br />As a father reading this book to my kid: It works well.  Any parent can see how well DiscWorld holds up the mirror to life in how Sam Vimes plays with his son as he reads this book.  Any parent has suffered through the sixtieth reading of a book written on a two year old level, and many of us have succumb to the desire to make those dreadful children's books a little more interesting.  Many of us have also been intensely browbeaten by our wives for this.  (Informal research indicates that the desire to take liberties with kids' books is a dad thing, hence the gender specific language).  To see this as the theme of a kids' book is a hoot.  Also, the way this book is written, it invites using different voices for different aspects of the book, a great source of entertainment for the munchkins.<br /><br />In all, I would only read it once for myself, maybe twice for the illustrations, but don't mind reading it numerous times for the young'un (and the young'un is just fine with this).for the munchkins. <br /> <br />In all, I would only read it once for myself, maybe twice for the illustrations, but don't mind reading it numerous times for the young'un (and the young'un is just fine with this).
B0009S3HI0|4.0|\\"Well it's about damn time\\"<br /><br />That was the the first thought that popped into my head when I found out the Deftones would be releasing a CD/DVD set of unreleased material and music videos. There are so many great, hard to find Deftones classics out there, it's high time some of them were presented in proper form to the public! \\"B-Sides & Rarities\\" comes at a good time, as we are still waiting for the fifth Deftones album (which keeps getting pushed back into oblivion). Along with Team Sleep's debut earlier this year, this set provides a nice placeholder for the new album. Something to keep us occupied until new music presents itself.<br /><br />Right off the bat, any Deftones fan who has spent time on the 'net downloading bootlegs and b-sides (or even buying those pricey imports) will tell you how much excellent material is missing. For starters, none of the group's original demos (of which, there are many) are included. One of the best demos, \\"Like Linus\\" would have fit in perfectly. Likewise, Charlie Clouser's rare remix of \\"My Own Summer (Shove It)\\" would have been great as well. But complaints aside, let's talk about what is actually on here. The CD is comprised of 14 tracks, mostly cover songs or acoustic versions of Deftones' classics. There are quite a few choice covers that show the obvious influences (i.e. The Cure, Helmet, Duran Duran) and a few totally bizarre, left-field choices as well. The one song that sticks out like a sore-thumb would be their cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Simple Man.\\" Musically, they nail the song, and make it their own. But unfortunately, Chino's vocal performance is rather uninspired, as he shows little to no emotion while singing a very sentimental song (reportedly, Chino didn't dig the song until after they recorded it). \\"No Oridnary Love\\" stands as one of the best covers they have done to date (a Sade cover) and also appeared on the \\"Change (In The House Of Flies)\\" single. This marks the first of four, count 'em, four collaborations on this disc with Jonah Matranga (of Far/Gratitude fame). The acoustic versions are all superb. I've had the acoustics of \\"Change\\" and \\"Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away)\\" for quite some time, but the inclusion of \\"Digital Bath\\" (one of my favorite songs) was especially appreciated, and well performed. I was a little disappointed in \\"Black Moon\\" and \\"Teenager (Idiot Pilot Version).\\" The former features B-Real of Cypress Hill, which could be a good thing, as they are one of the best hip-hop acts still around. But the song, unfortunately, carries absolutely no stamp of the Deftones. It's basically a Cypress Hill song, produced by Chino. The latter is Chino collaborating with a group by the name of Idiot Pilot for a reworking of \\"Teenager.\\" This version sounds flat when compared to the \\"White Pony\\" version, and makes you wonder why they even bothered.<br /><br />The DVD contains every music video the Deftones have done to date (even though that rare \\"Around The Fur\\" video still eludes us). All the classics like \\"My Own Summer (Shove It)\\" and \\"Change (In The House Of Flies)\\" are here, along with some lesser-known videos. For example, I didn't know \\"Bloody Cape\\" even had a video! And quite an entertaining one, at that. The videos for \\"Engine No. 9\\" and \\"Root\\" are, as expected, low budget montages of live footage. In between videos, various interview and live-clips pop-up, but unfortunately, don't amount to much. The highlights being Chino's reworking of Eminem's \\"Kill You\\" performed live, and Shavo from System Of A Down sharing an amusing anecdote about confusing the Deftones for Korn (all about the dreadlocks).<br /><br />Obviously, much more could have been done with this compilation, which is why it only gets 4-stars. They have such an enormous library of unreleased music, it seems criminal that the CD portion is only 14 tracks long. Also, the fact that the DVD is mainly just music videos is kinda boring as well. What about some (complete) live performances orbehind the scenes footage? Making of albums? I guess you just gotta take what you got. As it is, \\"B-Sides & Rarities\\" is a welcome addition to the collection of any Deftones fan. The packaging is great, with in-depth liner notes talking about each song and their origins. I only recommend this disc to those who have immersed themselves completely in the Deftones' four albums. Otherwise, the material on here may be hard to swallow.mances or behind the scenes footage?

Buy this CD for the brilliant music alone... <br /> <br />This is simply rock music at the highest level - a great band probably playing at its peak. Every song is a masterpiece, pure and simple.  <br /> <br />And then remember Queen and Freddie Mercury. They knew this CD would probably be their last as Queen. And they, as a group, gave it their all. Music, lyrics, performance -its all here.  <br /> <br />Listen to the CD again. And then you can cry for what we have lost.
B0000026NC|3.0|No doubt, Pink Floyd can pull off one hell of a rock concert, and I've only seen them on video! Their songs are great and the laser lights show is unmatched by any other band. Listening to their live album 'Delicate Sound of Thunder', I couldn't help but wonder if this is still the real Pink Floyd. It makes no sense to release a live album where the songs sound exactly the same as they do on the studio album. Listen to The Who or the Greatful Dead; their live songs are much more original and interesting then their studio songs. They offer something new and refreshing. No reason to buy a live album if it sounds exactly like the studio stuff, unless one likes to hear the croud cheer in the background.<br />I guess \\"Pink Floyd\\" was trying to make a few extra bucks from the songs and ideas of Roger Waters.  It seems like \\"Pink Floyd\\" accomplished at that goal.
B0009MAO46|5.0|Pixar in many ways are developing into one of my favorite animation studios. Disney, especially in recent years is basically just churning the movies out because they know it'll guarantee a profit. What happened to Bambi? Cinderella? Lion King? Even Fantasia. But Pixar came in and changed things for the better so hopefully Disney gets their act together because if Pixar so far has been 5 for 5(even though I only marginally like Monsters Inc). <br /> <br />It's the classic case of the leader being upstaged by the new kid. While human Andy is out of the room, his toys decide to play and chatter amongst themselves. Woody, a cowboy doll, is its probably unofficial leader. Until Andy's birthday party where Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure which impresses everyone, excluding Woody of course. <br /> <br />Overwhelmed by jealousy, he knocks Buzz out the window which of course gets Woody in trouble. Buzz follows Woody as Andy's going out for pizza. And of course Woody can't show up back home unless Buzz is with him. This all ends up culminating in both of them being caught in neighbour Sid's house, basically a toy destroyer. <br /> <br />One scene in the film in a way sums up the film for me: deciding to pay back Sid, the toys go all attack mode and reveal they're real with Woody providing comical creepiness. It's the charm of the entire scene that still makes me laugh, especially the \\"we toys can see everryyythiinnng\\". <br /> <br />The film is also littered with little inside jokes. Don Rickles had a catchphrase of \\"what are you looking at, you hockey puck?\\" So it makes sense his character says it to a hockey puck. The late Jim Varney playing Slinky says a catchphrase that Jim used to say as his most famous alter-ego Ernest P. Worrell. Toy Story also has such great characters with one of my favorites being these toy aliens you get in one of those manual-controlled vending machines where you gotta catch your prize. With their big nasal voice and their cult-like attitude towards the machine's claw, they're still funny. <br /> <br />Hopefully this is the last double dip by Pixar. I mean A Bug's Life had an original DVD release with no features, then an overpriced Collector's Edition than a traditionally priced 2 disc. Even Toy Story was on DVD I believe twice before this. But c'est la vie and even still this is still a good movie.
1410102033|4.0|Okay I had no interest in reading this book at first. I read Mein Kampf and The Communist Manifesto for a world governments course that I am currently enrolled in for college. I really don't agree with many of the opinions voiced in either book, but I take them at face value. Weather you agree with Hitler or not he was able to control the masses. My purpose for reading the book was to understand the man. The \\"method to the madness\\" if you will. Reading this book helped me to understand where he was comming from with some of his ideals. I don't agree with him, but atleast now I understand it. There's really no since in bashing something you know nothing about. I'm  not saying that you should follow the \\"teachings\\" in this book. I'm only saying that you need to know what you are talking about if you are gonna bash something.
0425156842|4.0|By all means, the book is not perfect. It was not meant to be a textbook of philosophy, yet as the readers get deeper into the book, they reflect on themselves and see that somehow their their lives do have philosophical meanings and such. <br /> <br />It is a hard read; I would admit that. But it doesn't take a lot away from the book. Gaarder has successfully written a story where we can enjoy, whether as a fiction book or a philosophical text.

B000286RKW|5.0|Love it. Simple as. People, though, focus too much on ol' Bobby De Niro in this. To me, the magic comes from main man Ray Liotta. Plays a super role as a boy who from a young age is seduced by the criminal lifestyle, the flash cars, money, and gorgeous women. He soon makes a name for himself but gets sucked deeper and deeper into the world of organised crime. Henry (Liotta) aided by his friends, Jimmy (De Niro), Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Paulie (Paul Sorvino) gets in over his head and has to decide what means more to him. Saving his own skin, or loyalty to the people who took care of him. A superb movie and a must have. Buy it. Enjoy!
0688170528|5.0|The Pact is by far one of the best books I have read in a long time. The characters were real and fully engrossing. The story was so packed with heart-wrenching nuances! Jodi Picoult's real talent is being able to fully flush out all the subtle emotional perspectives to a situation. I could really feel each character's dilemma and personal struggle with the situation. I am still tossing around the ending in my head. Do I agree with the verdict? I'm still not sure. That is the true beauty of Jodi Picoult's books. There is not one clear black or white answer. She helps us all to live in the grey zone.
B0006399FS|5.0|Ever Since I first heard them when I was little hooligan I've always loved U2. With good hits like \\"I still haven't found what I'm looking for\\", Beautiful Day, Ect.

If bono keeps doing what they do best Singing and recording new hits I'll keep going back to them.
B0000214F0|4.0|This movie, which I won't summarize for, is a masterpiece.  It has received some bad reviews here in amazon, but I have to say it's because these people are so used to the modern american movies that they cannot find themselves accepting this art anymore.  The movie is typical of the Italian movies made in Pier Paolo Pasolinis time, which I have to say that I am a fan of.  Some people even criticized on the screenplay and actors.  Well, this is what you should expect if you watch movies in this certain style.  The screenplay is magnificent.  It surmounts the fantasy of our modern screenplays and the actors are simply grasping.
B00005JO0J|5.0|A few disclaimers - I didn't discover Firefly until a few months before the film came out.  I didn't watch Buffy or Angel when they were on television.  I'm not a Star Trek or a sci-fi person, but I LOVED this film.  Above all it is a compelling story that has a cast that genuinely gels, it's evident that these people care about each other.<br /><br />I felt the same excitement in this film that I felt as a small girl seeing \\"Star Wars\\" for the first time -- something that I didn't think that I would ever experience again.  Much more that I expected from a summer movie - it turned me into a browncoat.  I'm eagerly awaiting more films!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never even heard of this show until about 3 months ago on TWiT.  Some co-workers had also seen this show and highly recommended it.  When I learned about the movie Serenity coming out, I decided that I needed check it out so that I would know what was going on when the movie hit the theaters.   <br /> <br />Therefore, I rented the four disc set of the Firefly show from Netflix.  All I can say is, WOW, what a great show.  After I had watched all the episodes, I told my sister and my Dad about it.  My sister and I watched a couple episodes together and she loved it. She then proceeded to watch the rest of the series over the next three days.  It is so good, it's addictive. <br /> <br />I went with my sister on opening night of Serenity and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I now find myself appreciating both Firefly and Serenity to the point that I decided to purchased two DVD sets of the Firefly series, one for myself, and one for my sister for her upcoming birthday (hope she doesn't read this).  I also plan to own Serenity on DVD.   <br /> <br />Like a lot of other impressed reviewers, I plan to loan this DVD collection to my Dad and other family members and friends.  This show is just too good to keep it to myself.
0684833395|4.0|I went into this book with mixed feelings.  On the one hand, this book is widely considered a masterpiece, and friends who know my reading tastes were shocked that I hadn't read and fallen in love with this book.  On the other hand, the (newer) copy of the book I read starts out with a pretty lame preface by the author: he writes about what great reviews the book got, and how well-received the book was.  It's hard not to come away from such a self-congratulatory preface without a bad taste in your mouth. <br /> <br />So did the book live up to the hype?  No, not really.  Heller is exceedingly clever at times, and he displays a masterful command of the language.  The characters are all top-notch - well illustrated and interesting to read about.   <br /> <br />However, the flaws were also very apparent.  Catch-22 weighs in at 452 pages; while the characters remain interesting, the zany predicaments they land themselves in become repetitious.  For example, a chapter after Yossarian learns about 'Catch-22', he has a conversation with a prostitute, who tells him that she won't marry him because he's insane, and he's insane because he wants to marry her.  I felt like I was reading a recycled joke - nowhere near the laugh-out-loud hilarity I was expecting.   <br /> <br />The story is not told in a linear fashion - characters will talk about an event in chapter 2 that isn't described until chapter 10 - and this gives the story a meandering, episodic sitcom sort of feeling.  Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't.  So far as themes go, the book does a decent job of mixing absurd inanity with serious war-time events, but I personally feel that Vonnegut mixes tragedy and comedy far more skillfully than Heller. <br /> <br />Also, I thought Catch-22 would be the story of Yossarian trying to act crazy in order to bypass Catch-22, but this isn't the case.  Catch-22 is really a collection of loosely-related zany incidents that Yossarian's squadron go through - the story of \\"Catch-22\\" is really just one in a series of clever conversations.  <br /> <br />Despite all my reservations, Catch-22 is still a better book than most books you'll read, and most definitely worth reading if you haven't already.  I just felt that all of the unqualified praise that this book is getting needed some counterpoint.
0679441018|1.0|Memnock The Devil shows that Ann Rice is not \\"losing it\\"--she's LOST it in this 5th of the Vampire Chronicles.  Lestat has decayed into a helpless, hopeless and hysterical character unable to cope with himself, with what's happened to himself--falling in love with the mortal daughter of way too rich drug-lord type promising he'll \\"take care of her\\" when he comes back as a ghost.   <br />Next, Memnoch takes Lestat for a \\"tour of Hell\\" from which he barely escapes, making it back to his posh New York digs only to collapse on the floor to tell of his disbelief in the Hell concept--even after having seen it(!), his defiance in NOT helping Memnoch fight God, and is 100% undone by his experiences with The Devil. <br />Finally--after not having \\"fed\\" for too long--his blood lust takes over in his hotel suite--and this is where Rice becomes vulgar, disgusting, and repugnant IN THE EXTREME by the way Lestat satisfies himself on the daughter with the others of his close Vampire clan looking on.  This particular scene is pornographic voyeurism of the most twisted and sick/Sick/SICK sort but Rice goes ahead and describes it IN DETAIL--and it is here in the book that she sold herself to \\"prurient interest\\" became an author-to-avoid for me. <br />Read it if you must, but you're wasting your money to buy a copy at ANY price.
B000002B2X|4.0|I bought this CD about 1 year ago and I have to say that it's actually really fantastic. The first four songs are acoustic pieces, but there are also moments of powerful electric guitar and angst that Alice In Chains are famous for. The fifth and final song is more of a joke-song and not one I enjoy particularly. However it is pretty funny and decidedly strange, so it's good to see that the band are capable of having some fun too. Lets take a closer look at Alice In Chains' \\"SAP.\\"<br /><br />\\"Brother,\\" is just an extraordinary track. The acoustic guitar is quite light and the lyrics are almost whispered. The words themselves also contain some very powerful imagery and enhance the song's emotion and sadness. I always think of my brothers when I listen to this song and the fact that I hardly ever see one of them. It's a personal thing but the song seems to be talking about the special relationship that brothers share. This song gets 10/10 in my opinion, it's simply flawless.<br /><br />\\"Got Me Wrong,\\" is slightly heavier than \\"Brother\\" and seems to talk about what happens when two or more people disagree with each other. The acoustic parts are melancholic and sombre while the electric parts are full of energy and angst. It's another fabulous song with some stunning melodies and lyrical content. Another solid 10/10, no doubt about it.<br /><br />\\"Right Turn,\\" is a song performed with Chris Cornell (Soundgarden) and Mark Arm (Mudhoney). It's got a very gentle and soft acoustic guitar riff with a tamborine that enters in later on. The lyrical work is phenomenal and all vocalists sound brilliant on this track. There are no drums at all in this song and the tamborine serves to keep the rhythm. It's a really good song but not my absolute favourite. 9/10 for \\"Right Turn.\\"<br /><br />\\"Am I Inside?\\" begins with an acoustic guitar being plucked and even some very subtle piano in the background. There are numerous cymbal washes that add to the ethereal feeling of the song. You never actually hear anything other than the gentle ringing of cymbals in the background, so the idea behind this song is very similar to \\"Right Turn.\\" The lyrics are haunting and seem almost distant in certain instances. It's a beautiful song and around about the 2:40 mark a female vocalist enters the song (it sounds female anyway). It's the longest and most gentle song on the album and is very effective. It gets 9/10 in my book.<br /><br />\\"Love Song,\\" is the mess-around song that begins with a sort of Honky-Tonk piano and some weird wailing and almost goofy drums. There are a series of farting noises and grunts in this song and it sounds really creepy actually. Cantrell \\"sings\\" on this song and I'm not exactly sure what the hell he's saying. Except for \\"my gums are bleeding.\\" It's pretty aimless and probably Alice In Chains most ridiculous and um...disturbing song. It's not really a song I listen to because of its weirdness and directionless approach. It ends off with Cantrell saying \\"kiss the midget\\" (cough cough). I'd give it 5/10 because it actually is kinda funny and scares the hell out of me.<br /><br />So there you have it. 4 out of 5 songs are pure 24-carat gold. And the last song is good for a laugh or just getting spinal shivers. Overall I'd give this E.P 85%. It loses points because it's a little short, and the last song is just a joke-song. Other than that, it's a great CD and essential for any Alice In Chains fan's collection. It's a really entertaining little E.P and one that is worth the money. So go ahead, buy it today!g.

B0007KTBIU|5.0|I totally disagree with the original poster the movie was excellent in every aspect. The musicals were the best part of the movie. Pictures were great this movie is definitely worth your time. This is great for the kids. I give this a 9 3/4.
0767834739|4.0|I remember going to watch the first installment of this series with my old friend in the cinema. And I have to say it was really great and alot of fun, even if some things were a little questionable. A little while ago I watched \\"Resident Evil - Apocalypse\\" on DVD. And I found it to be very good, but it just wasn't as good as the original. Allow me to elaborate a little...<br /><br />\\"R.E - Apocalypse\\" picks up from the ending of \\"R.E.\\" Basically, we find that Raccoon City is under siege by a terrible plague that brings the dead to life (surprise!). We are soon introduced to some new characters, one being Jill Valentine (played by Sienna Guillory). Now when I saw Jill for the first time she looked exactly like the Jill from the games - except here she has black rather than brown hair! It's a minor thing of course, but obviously sufficient attention wasn't given to the appearance of characters. Anyway, Jill's ruthless and good with a gun, and that's all that matters. Later on we also meet Carlos Olivera (played by Oded Fehr. Carlos was from the third Resident Evil Game). He's a leader and a great fighter, but this Carlos is much older than the Carlos from the game. Nemesis is pretty well done but his face just looks slightly different from what I remember. And the Nemesis in the movie has some pretty massive guns, which is true to the games as far as I'm concerned. Anyway, all the human characters trapped in the city must escape Raccoon City before dawn or they'll all be turned into Nuclear Pulp. The storyline is similar to the games but it's not particularly original. Overall characters get 7/10 and the storyline gets 6/10.<br /><br />The monsters in \\"R.E - Apocalypse\\" are well done, but the zombies are not as gruesome as they were in the previous movie. Those creatures with the massive tongues are pretty well done and the mutant Dobermans are great. I've already talked about Nemesis, so I'll continue...all creatures and monsters have unique characteristics and are pretty ugly for the most part, so I'll give monsters and creatures 8/10. The zombies are not always completely convincing, but the zombie kids were awesome! No doubt about that...<br /><br />The structure of the film is a little disjointed at times and not really condusive to an action film, but it's forgivable as the action scenes more than compensate for this. The explosions are big, the conflict violent and complex, and the drama convincing.  In this respect I'll give \\"R.E - Apocalypse\\" 8/10 for action and drama, but 6/10 for the structure. It's just what I felt, so don't take it as an attack on you if you enjoyed the stucture. Conversely one could say that the disjointed structure merely heightens the drama, so perhaps structure deserves 7/10. But it's your choice and opinion that inevitably matters.<br /><br />I think the setting of a chaotic city is fascinating and the environments are nicely done. Well, perhaps I should say the environments look like they've been ravaged and destroyed. There were plenty of zombies, lots of broken glass and abandoned vehicles, blood spatters and finally empty streets. The environments are very convincing and deserve 9/10. Perhaps the directors could've used filters in some places to enhance the film and its tension, but perhaps it would've made it more of an Art Movie, which it definitely is not! So that comment is just an aside from me...<br /><br />One thing I found to be funny was Stefan Hayes' (or Yuri Loginova's) extremely dodgy Russian accent! At times he got the accent nailed, but there were instances where he sounded like an American or an angry European! Look, it didn't bother me much and he doesn't speak that much in the movie. All I can say is that I've met Russian people, and if you think THAT's Russian, well...it's not I'm afraid. It's not hard to miss his poor accent, it's extremely noticeable.<br /><br />Overall \\"Resident Evil - Apocalypse\\" gets 75% according to my percentage system. It's fun and entertaining but is extremely far fetched in some cases (an example of this is when Alice arrives in the nick of time to save Valentine (et al) by smashing through a stained-glass window on a motorcycle, then landing and back-flipping off. The bike then ramps and she fires to shots that hit the gas tank, causing the bike to combust and killing some of the long tongued creatures. I'm sorry, she may be super, but that's a steaming pile of goat s***) and is flawed in many places. Don't get me wrong, I'll watch it again, but it's no classic and certainly not totally well done. And if you think that's wrong, ask a stuntman to backflip off a bike, ramp it and blow it up without killing himself. I rest my case. So it's a cool film, but nothing I would call special. Buy if you like, it's a 50-50 for me...ertaining but is extremely far fetched in some cases (an example of this is when Alice arrives in the nick of time to save Valentine (et al) by smashing through a stained-glass window on a motorcycle, then landing and back-flipping off.

0142000655|5.0|This is the first Steinbeck novel I have ever read, and I have to say that I'm hooked. The prose is unbelievable, the detail stunning and the characters have a gritty realness to them that I've never experienced before. You loath them one minute and love them the next. Only Shaara's The Killer Angels has ever taken me on this kind of ride before. Great book!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Well, I liked this movie. <br />Many have written that it's about Confederates, and to hell with them and their war-suffering - they were cruel and evil, etc. I never understand this viewpoint.  Confederates and others have been wrong and still had deeply moving, interesting lives. In fact their fallability and loss at being decieved and dedicated to the wrong side of historic events, makes them more sympathetic to me. <br /> <br />If you want to root for the goodguys there are a thousand films out there. The suffering of a losing army in any war is vastly greater than that of the victors, and those broken soldiers have often have worthy stories. It is in heartbreak and defeat that one's deepest character is fully revealed.  After all, they didn't necessarily choose their side of the war. Their town was on in a certain area and the leaders of the region declared war. They had no options at all. <br /> <br />I thought the plot was thin on dialogue and was sometimes a bit flat, but Jude Law and Nicole are like walking poetry. Seeing the light in their eyes - words were unnecessary. The plot pulled them together in a sort of relentless call-to-romance which I thought was beautiful and haunting, where all outside events fell away around the hope of seeing their missing suitor. They were instant soulmates, a modern Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br />Very few movies can convey deep emotion, either romantic love or real treagedy to the audience - it's an innaccessible emotional place which few directors can reach. Minghella has attempted it here and it worked on me.  Both thumbs way up.   <br /> <br />One curious note:  In the book, Renee Zellweger's character was African American. Renee did a wonderful job, but wouldn't that have worked better here?   <br /> <br />If you liked this, see 'Ride with the Devil' Ang Lee's excellent film on the Civil War starring Tobey Mcguire.
B000B5QWKG|3.0|I just recently in the past 6 months or so got really into franz, and after playing their first unbelievably amazing album into oblivion, I could hardly wait to get my hands on this one. After hearing the very fluffy and danceable \\"Do You Want To\\", I knew that \\"You could have it so much better\\" was going to be just as good if not better. That's why I was kind of disappointed after listening to it.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, it's not that the album is bad. The lyrics are actually very strong, the instruments sound great, and the songs are good listens. The thing is, if you're expecting the same catchy, danceable music of the debut (like I was), you're going to be disappointed. \\"The Fallen\\" and \\"Do You Want to\\" are my favorites, but everything else was just not the stuff I was hoping for. \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\" sounds nothing like Franz- if you heard it 40 years ago, you would think it was the Beatles. Most of the songs like \\"You're the Reason I'm Leaving\\" and \\"Evil and a Heathen\\" just sound the same.  <br /> <br />The Dualdisc DVD features are great though. I love the interview, the \\"Do You Want To\\" video is hilarious, and the studio stuff is cool. Worth the extra couple of bucks.  <br /> <br />Overall, if you love Franz as much as I do, I wouldn't miss this album. I was a little disappointed in the songs, but I guess its just a new sound that I have to get used to. On a more exciting note, I'm seeing them live on October 17th and I can't wait!!
0743454537|5.0|This is the saddest book I've ever read. However, I think everyone should read it. It really explores family relationships (not just sisters)during difficult times. It's easy to empathize with the characters in the storyline because you are given all of their perspectives.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|If you are one who is very deep into music then this by far hands down will be one of the most amzing albums you will ever listen to. If you are a very spiritual person thats into Christian music then.....this by far hands down will be one of the most amazing albums you will ever listen to. <br /> <br />   Neal Morse who is best know for his work in Spocks Beard departed when he found his faith then wrote this masterpiece and surounded himself with some of the wrolds most amazing musicians including Mike Portnoy best known as founder & drummer of Prog band Dream Theater. What you get is a 2+ hr ride into Neals life and how he came to find his faith. <br /> <br />   One thing to make clear. You DO NOT have to believe in God to listen to this album. This is one of those CD's you throw on close your eyes, and let the music take you to another place. It is truely amazing and I think everyone should listen to this record to see what music is all about. Give it a listen. A+
B00005NGZX|4.0|When I first heard Converge 3-4 years ago, I was so turned off.  It was just loud sensless screaming, and not just screaming..SHREAKING!  Lol.  My cousin felt the same, but he actually got to like Converge which surprised me, but I still went against it.  Then I got into my curious/open mind mood and decided to buy a Converge album, which was You Fail Me.  I really wanted Jane Doe, which I read was supposed to be their best ablum but it wasn't there so I settled for YFM, after hearing you fail me, I wasn't satisfied, not that I hated it, I just had to hear their best album - Jane Doe.  First hearing Jane Doe, it had that annoying shreaking screaming that I remember, which You fail me didn't have as much.  But, after hearing JD again, I started to like it.  I guess that shreaking just blended for me.  I can see why this is their \\"best\\" album.  Converge isn't for everyone as was the case for me.  And, i'm not always in the mood to hear Jane Doe, but when i'm in the mood, it works. I really don't think of Converge as a true heavy metal band, I guess they are like a metal influenced band with punk, hardcore,and noisecore influences.  Lol, I'm not to serious about those genres that I mentioned, as in a other review I wrote, these are fan-made creations but I said them to help you understand what Converge sound like.  pick it up if you like hard music, but be prepared for the shreaking, lol.
0743454537|5.0|A great book that raises so many issues, ethically and emotionally. A true page-turner, I didn't want to put it down! I was close to tears a number of times throughout the book, and while many did not like the ending, I thought it was incredibly well written and encouraged even more discussion and thought. Do keep your tissues handy though, it's engrossing, but sad.
B000004286|5.0|Braveheart like other scores has a theme that stuck with me because of it's beauty and drama.  Not only is there drama in here, but war as well. Bagpipes and other scottish music is in here combined with orchestra. One of Horner's top scores.  Must for a soundtrack collector.
B0002S943O|5.0|I'm a Depeche Mode fan that's why I'm colleting every depeche mode dvd on sales. I need this dvd to fill my collection I'm satisfied in every aspect. Thanks to you I could get these dvds which I can't find in nearby stores.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|Not really having known anything about Robert McNamara, other than who he was and that he was the Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War, I went into this documentary on the recommendation of a friend and actually felt that I would not be able to endure the whole movie.  Well, to my surprise, McNamara is actually very interesting to listen to and his story both impressed and engrossed my full attention. <br /> <br />This documentary is segmented into 11 life lessons McNamara gives the viewer.  Unless your a politician or CEO of a large company, I didn't find these lessons to be something a \\"common\\" civilian would actually use.  However, it appears that these were more the 11 life lessons that McNamra had learned in his various impressive positions in life.   <br /> <br />I found his stories on working at Ford Motors to be the most enjoyable part of the film.  I think the reason I felt this, was because it was a much more light-hearted piece of the film.  When he does begin to speak about his time as the Secretary of Defense, he obviously talks about the Vietnam War and how taxing it was on the AMerican people, himself and Lyndon Johnson.  It's fascinating to hear McNamra tell about how different his and Johnson's views on the war were.  Johnson wanting at all cost for America to win the war and do whatever necessary, where McNamra was really against sending in more troops.  And, there are actual taped phone conversations between him and Johnson.  For me though, the subject matter in this portion was just not something I could imagine sitting through again.  I do enjoy history of wars, but the Vietnam War is not particularly a subject I liek to get into. <br /> <br />Going back to his days at Ford Motors, McNamra tells the viewer about how he came with the conclusion that people need to be packaged properly in cars, in order to lessen the number of deaths due to accident.  He also goes into great detail on the number of statistical data he compiled and tests heran in order to boast the sales of Ford Motors, by increasing their car's quality.  Very interesting stuff and again, McNamra is really a delight to listen to.  He is very engaging. <br /> <br />All in all, I found this to be a very well done documentary and one certainly worth watching!
B000002KCI|5.0|A fair amount of Neil Young's albums were largely overlooked, some of them (especially in the 80s) deservedly so.  But \\"Zuma\\" is probably the most brilliant hidden gem in his catalogue.  Although this is one of his Crazy Horse collaborations, the album is fairly representative of the styles of the first six years of his solo career.  \\"Don't Cry...\\" could be an outtake from \\"Everybody Knows...\\", as could \\"Pardon My Heart\\" be from \\"Gold Rush\\", \\"Stupid Girl\\" from \\"On The Beach\\", and \\"Barstool Blues\\" from \\"Tonight's The Night\\".  There's even a gorgeous song (\\"Through My Sails\\") with Crosby Stills & Nash that's easily among the best material that CSNY recorded.    All that would mean little were it not that \\"Zuma\\" is a consistently engaging and entertaining listen.  All of the songs are great and Neil also provides glimpses into his future direction (so influential to grunge) with the feedback drenched \\"Danger Bird\\" and the searing \\"Drive Back\\".    The aforementioned songs alone would make this a five star album.  Add to that \\"Cortez The Killer\\" which is not just one of my favorite Neil Young songs, but one of my favorite songs period.  (And I have 1200 CDs so that's saying something).  \\"Cortez\\" is a song of such aching beauty, it's impossible to imagine anyone else pulling this off.  Listen to the near four minute solo that opens the song to understand why Neil is so revered among rock musicians.  There are scores of guitarists more technically brilliant than him, but none (and I mean none) can squeeze the same emotional impact out of every note.  By the time Neil sings the first words \\"He came dancing across the water\\", the listener is totally emotionally connected.  This is simply one of the most brilliant moments in rock and roll history.    Neil Young is one of those artists so important that he is not well served by compilations.  If you're serious about rock, you need to own at least five of his original albums.  Make sure this is one of them.
B00005JO0J|5.0|Long time fan of Joss!  I loved the Firefly series, and currently have the entire Buffy/Angel/Firefly dvd collections!  So you could imagine the long-awaited anticipation for the movie!<br /><br />I won't go into details that have already been done to death, but if I could give this movie seven stars I would!<br /><br />I plan to watch the upcoming Serenity dvd many, many times!<br /><br />Oh yeah, and it blows the Star Wars prequals and Star Trek movies out of the water!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|This is going to be great!I`ve never been able to find the first Lady and The Tramp on DVD lately for my new baby brother,but now,when this comes out,I can finally get it for him!This Special Edition looks like it will be absolutly wonderful!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|i've been in television for 15 years. i've worked on plenty of programs that have been cancelled for lots of reasons, and sometimes shows are taken off the air for reasons that have nothing to do with how good that show is.  Firefly is one of those programs. <br /> <br />only 9 episodes of the 11 contained on the DVD set ever aired, and they still won an emmy for best special effects for a television series... <br /> <br />the concept of the colonization of space paralelling the colonization and westward expansion of the post american civil war era makes for great stories that i can't seem to get enough of, and after watching the Serenity movie last weekend, i am hoping to see more from this cast and crew. <br /> <br />hands down one of the best television shows i've seen in long long time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is rare to find a quality show where you truly care for all the characters, even the villians.  Firefly is a treasure that I have shared with several friends and each friend has gotten hooked and has shared it with their friends.  It has something for everyone.  It always leaves you wanting more.
B00000IQV7|1.0|No truth to any of it.  Sickeningly manipulative.  Pure trite Hollywood garbage.  I never write negative reviews but shame on these people.  The only laugh I got was at the film's expense during the horrendous now notorious butterfly scene.  A complete insult to the intelligence of the American filmgoer (or any other nation for that matter).
B000005JA8|1.0|There are many many many overrated albums out there in the music market (and many underrated ones for that matter) and this is defnitely the most overrated music album out there (if you can even call it a music album)! I dont care what all the magazines say and i dont care what all the reviewers think ; how can you actually sit down and listen to this album and actually enjoy it? Its a total waste of time!
0783240236|5.0|This movie is just as entertaining now as when it when I first saw it! Hitchcock at his best. A classic worth adding to your collection. Good actors, great action and cinematography, leaves you wondering...
B000001FK3|5.0|I have to admit that i stumbled on this cd accidentally , i knew who jj cale was , i knew his songs , but i never actually listened to his versions of his own songs like they call me the breeze and after midnight, i only bought it because i have a hidden urge to buy all the albums which were originally released between 1969 and 1973 . I just cant put to words how this album moved my soul (now i own all j j cale albums!) from the concentrated guitar work to the smoky singing of j j to the sheer genius songwriting which has influenced many including eric clapton himself! I urge every true music lover to buy this album , this cannot be compared to anything else.
0895260131|5.0|Contrary to what a couple of the members of the Left have said here, I don't see this book as being written from the vantage point of hate and anger.  I have read this book and it only confirmed a lot of the things I've come to know over the past four or five years about the Nation of Islam.  Islam is NOT the peaceful, tolerant, loving religion that they claim to be.  The goal of Islam is to convert the entire world to Islam and to do it at the point of a sword.<br /><br />Those that have said that this book is filled with lies and deceit are the kind of people that will tell you that, but be hard pressed to name one concrete example of a lie in the book, showing that they most likely have never even cracked the cover of the book, let alone read it.  These are the same people that will condemn Christianity as being hate filled and worthy of censorship, but at the same time will look you right in the eye and tell you that the average Muslim is a loving, caring and benevolent person, only wanting to live in peace with the rest of the world.  Robert Spencer has shown us in this book that that is an outright fallacy and a very dangerous one at that.<br /><br />It's time for the American people, and non-Muslims around the world for that matter, to wake up and see Islam for what it really is.  A religion based on subjugation, violence, wife-beating and terror.  Mohammed was no more a prophet than Osama Bin Laden.  He was a common thief, murderer, rapist and terrorist.  And we need to wake up to that fact before we have that sword placed at the back of our own necks.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Madonna and cohort Mirwais Ahmadzai hit the spot with American Life.  The incessant groove and commitment to a singular vision makes this a great follow up to her Ray of Light album...<br /><br />I saw this in the bargain bin though - so it probably didn't do as well as it should've - but kudos to Madonna for pulling off a great, brave album...American Life is more brilliant than critics will allow it to be.  This stands up to anything that any other female artist of a less commercial ilk might have produced - read \\"indie.\\"  It's lyrical and poetic in parts and both folksy and ballsy.  There are nice quiet moments in here.<br /><br />And she's moved on again!
1577314808|5.0|For people who are having difficulty with their lives, or who are searching for spiritual progression, this book is a simple and profound journey. I have been reading books of a spiritual nature and practising meditation techniques for over a decade and this book is a synthesis of most of the information I have found that is presented in a straightforward and immediately usable format. Tolle uses quotes from the great masters of all traditions to illustrate many of the points he is making. I recommend it heartily to everyone and feel that the methods described would also be extremely helpful to impart to children and the aged who find themselves frightened of what lies ahead. If used by everyone, this book could transform humanity.
B00004X01U|3.0|I wasn't as hooked by this as her previous album RAY OF LIGHT and the one after: AMERICAN LIFE....Music is a lot flatter and doesn't quite succeed in creating the vibe for me...<br /><br />My version has American Pie on it!  Not sure why this one here doesn't...
B00005221M|4.0|The Last of the Mohicans <br /> <br /> You might like a movie for it's characters, plot, or setting.  I liked \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\", directed by Michael Mann for its characters.  The characters are people who are struggling for life in battle.  They have issues, romance, and enemies.  This what the movie is all about. <br /> First, they have lots of issues.  Duncan does not like the Indian men.  The father ends up mad at his daughters.  One last issue is when they are under a waterfall and their enemies capture them.  Nevertheless, it was always green on the other side. <br /> Second, we get to the romance.  There wasn't as much romance as I thought there would be.  The only romance I saw was when that dude kiss the dark haired lady.  The romance part kinda sucked big time.  In conclusion, they could have been better. <br /> Finally, the enemies.  Their were lots of enemies in this movie.  The red coats were against the Mohicans.  The bad Indians where against the Mohicans.  To conclude, everyone was against the Mohicans. <br /> In summary, the movie was great.  There were problems, kissing, and the antagonist.  Over all it was a good movie and I would recommend it to everyone.
B00005Q66T|4.0|What I like about GHV2 is that Madonna enters the 2nd phase of her career and flies off into another groove.  The tracks are more mature, contemplative, adult and progressive.  This seems to be the Madonna I enjoy listening to.  Her volume 1 older hits are great for a retro party, but the songs here are a lot more endearing.  Perhaps only Take A Bow (and definitely Erotica - which I skip!) have dated a bit for me.  But other than that - Madonna has locked onto a musically sophisticated direction that hasn't stopped since.<br /><br />What else about this album?  There's a nice essay of sorts and great photos.  The most photographed woman in the world next to Princess Di looks great from page to page - highlighting the remarkable chameleon like changes she's undergone - while remaining the person she is.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Saw Cream at the Murry the K Show in 66. and six times before they broke up. Let me just say that this band was not just about music. It was part of an energy field that occurred at a certain point on time that may never be duplicated. Cream, Jimi,Dylan, Mick, the Dead, Jim and Janis..it was much more than music....To tap into that long lost energy field by recreating the music forty years later - a Stones Concert, this amazing Cream reunion, McCartney on stage, Dylan-its really a spiritual trip...Do you think thirty years from now, there will be REM reunion concerts?...Green Day in 2035?  Think on it and just retap into the energy that is no more..btw, Clapton IS God...
630460288X|3.0|Early 1990's vision of Los Angeles in the future 2032-AD. Good funny futuristic atmosphere that doesn't seem all too serious of a thriller these days but when this movie came out, it was a big hit. If the future is really how this movie depict it to be, then i don't want to be part of it. Come on now, the future seem so cheesy in 2032 that i look forward to being frozen in time until the next millenium. Sandra Bulluck is a happy go lucky goodie too shoe cop as a sidekick that irritates Sly Stallone to such a degree that he be screaming '..cut me mick cut me' and 'Adrianne!!!!' in no time at all. One thing i do find hard to believe is taco bell winning the fast food war to be the only food franchise existing in the future....blahhh!!!!! One more thing....Sly, stop it with the one liner comebacks because it's getting old no matter what century were in.   <br /> <br />Check this out for Sly fan's...it is one of his best nevertheless and i enjoy watching it when it came out on the big screens. I find it funny viewing the movie now but still...
B000002MTR|5.0|By far my favorite RHCP album and quite possibly my favorite album by any artist of all time. <br /> <br />On this CD, the band emerges with a totally creative and unique sound - one that is perfectly balanced between the old-school RHCP funk and the new style of RHCP sophistication. <br /> <br />The sound, overall, is amazing. It is obvious that the band has matured; however, with Dave Navarro's contributing funky guitar riffs, the classic funky sound from previous albums definitely isn't ignored. <br /> <br />RHCP shines with happy, playful songs such as Aeroplane (arguably the best song on the CD); goofy and bass-dominated songs like Pea; further-pensive and sophisticated songs like My Friends; and even confident, bittersweet, and a bit brash songs like Warped and One Big Mob. <br /> <br />The album is the perfect blend and I have enjoyed it since the day I bought it. Absolutely worth buying.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I would say this belongs to the genre of alternative electronic pop...the first time you hear the album a couple of tracks stand out (their hits, \\"Last Days Inc\\", \\"Dare\\" etc); but the more you listen to this album from scratch, the more you get impressed with it. <br /> <br />I've never had so much fun listening to quirky music. This album may not be for all, but if you're interested in listening to different music and not your regular \\"Waiting for Tonight\\", grab this. <br /> <br />Two thumbs up, way up!
B000093BDX|4.0|I am now 57 years old, and at one time I was into \\"surfing\\" at the shores of New Jersey in my middle to late teens. My first love, and me were very much into the \\"Beachboys\\" music at this time. So, when I listen to their sounds now, I flash-back on my youthful years, and Summer-time. I usually listen to these old songs while I am working out in my gym at home. They bring back all \\"good\\" memories of the good old days for me, while I was growing into manhood. Then I joined the U.S. Marine Corps.and went off to war.
B000069KIZ|5.0|Karl Bohm's recording of Brahms Four Symphonies with the Vienna Philharmonic (recorded 1975-76) is one of the great bargains of the DG catalog.  These are recorded in beautiful analog stereo sound in the Musikvereinsalle, one of the world's great concert halls, and Bohm was in great shape when these were put on tape. <br />The Vienna Philharmonic could of course play these works in their sleep, having recorded and performed them numerous times under other great conductors since Brahms (1833-1897) was living.  Karl Bohm (1894-1981) had ample experience conducting Brahms, having recorded Symphonies 1 and 2 with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1940, and again with Symphonies 1 and 2 with the Berlin Philharmonic for DG, about 1960.  There is a famous Bohm/Dresden State Orchestra recording of Brahms Symphony 4 from the late 1930s, reissued in the US on Dutton (but may be deleted now), and a Vox LP (mono) of Brahms 3 by Bohm/Vienna from about 1952. <br /> <br />Bohm's tempos here are slower than some, especially the Allegros, but his sense of forward motion and phrasing do not make them seem overly long or tedious, as is the case with Bernstein's 1983 recordings, with the same orchestra (DG). <br />Symphony 1 is big and bold, and Bohm is not afraid to slow down for big moments, although he does not jerk tempos around for effect, as do some conductors.  Symphony 2 seems more autumnal than some recordings, but is perfect in flow and pacing.  Symphonies 3 and 4 sound beautiful, and are again on the moderate to slow side.  These are all beautiful recordings, and I have the highest admiration for them.   <br /> <br />DG waited a long time to release Karl Bohm's Brahms Symphonies, as they already had cycles by Karajan/Berlin (1978 and 1987-88, 2 different cycles), Bernstein/Vienna (1983) and Abbado/Berlin (early 1990s) in their catalog.  But they have done a great job with this presentation, and the dismates: Haydn Variations, Tragic Overture, and Alto Rhapsody with Christa Ludwig,are all first rate and very beautiful.   <br /> <br />One apt description for this release would be \\"think of Bruno Walter with a better orchestra.\\"  Since Bohm was Walter's assistant at the Munich opera in the early 1920s - the beginning of his career - this is an appropriate description.
B00005JO0J|4.0|I've never seen a single episode of FIREFLY, so I can speak about this movie as a novice.   <br /> <br />There were MANY things to like about it.  Probably best was the dialogue.  While this is one of those movies where everyone gets to say the kind of lines REAL people would never come up with off the top of their heads...it doesn't mean those witty lines aren't a blast.  You want your gritty, scruffy characters to be smart-asses.  You want them to talk tough (but deep-down they're just a bunch of softies).  And the crew of SERENITY lives up to that expectation...it's a constant battle of dry one-liners and cutting insults.  While this sort of thing is often used to substitute for real character development, I found that the ease the actors had with each other went a long way towards getting rid of any hint of clich.  They were all simply likeable right off the bat. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the simple plot.  There wasn't too much here that was groundbreaking...political hijinks, battle between established order and a bunch of rebels, a rag-tag gang of misfits just trying to maneuver through it.  In many ways, SERENITY could have been the MILLENIUM FALCON, just with a larger crew.  But that being said, the movie provided enough fun, and was paced quite rapidly...so again, the clichs were minimized. <br /> <br />The movie features the actors from the TV show, and they aren't exactly household names.  However, they all provide solid work here, and should continue to get work.  Nathan Fillion as the captain has by far the most important role, and he is likeable and believable.  Not TOO good looking...he looks like he's been on the losing end of more than one battle.   <br /> <br />The movie does betray its low-budget roots occasionally.  The special effects are serviceable but nothing special.  The locations are far less richly realized than a \\"blockbuster\\" like STAR WARS, where every frame is eye-candy.  But the movie has never marketed itself as the biggest, glossiest, newest kid on the block.  It doesn't shoot for being an all-time classic.  But if fulfills its modest aims with more success than bigger movies frequently fill theirs. <br /> <br />The movie also offers a couple of pretty big surprises in terms of how it treats its main characters.  I don't want to spoil anything, but I think it was pretty brave to take some of the permanent steps it does.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed myself very much, and my VERY skeptical wife liked it too.  I would certainly be in favor of a sequel.  So I can recommend this movie to sci-fi / action fans without hesitation.  Not being familiar with FIREFLY should not dampen your enjoyment.  And I also find the film quite suitable for audiences about age 11 and up. <br />
B000063COX|5.0|This album was overshadowed by the next progressively by Killers, Number of the Beast, Peice of Mind, and Powerslave, and while I can say all of them except Killers (which I do not own, and haven't really heard yet) deserve their own hype, they don't deserve it at the expense of this album. Of course part of the reason why this album is relatively buried is also because only 2 of the 5 members of the classic Maiden lineup were in place yet. This features Paul Di'Anno singing, Clive Burr on drums, and Denis Stratton (who?) on guitars. But all in all the album doesn't suffer at all from that. Praise Nicko McBrain and of Bruce Dickinson if you like(certainly they deserve it), but Di'Anno and Burr were apparently a talented pair as well. Stratton I have nothing in particular bad to say about, but with 7 other Maiden albums in my collection its also clear in hindsight that Murray and Harris could have carried this album without him. Anyway, with the possible exception of track #7, \\"Strange World\\" every song on this cd is catchy to the point of addictiveness (ok maybe \\"catchy\\" doesn't quite describe \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" since it isn't exactly upbeat or bubble-gummy but it is beautiful and certainly demands repeat listening). Paul Di'Anno is definately another high point of this album in my opion. While he doesn't have the awesome range Bruce Dickinson would bring starting with \\"Number of the Beast\\" 2 years later, the material for this album isn't nearly as epic and fantastical as the songs Dickinson shows his one of a kind touch on anyway. And make no mistake, Di'Anno is a very good vocalist in his own right. He proves himself capable of some range and some pretty vocals on Remember Tomorrow, and shows he has more balls than pretty much any heavy metal vocalist yet recorded in 1980 on \\"Runnin Free\\" and \\"Iron Maiden\\". I'd be really interested to know what happened to him after Dickinson replaced him. And in general Di'Anno and the general lack of that classic epic, fantastical nature give this album a really broad appeal. If you are a fan of really old school heavy metal, that is if you spin up a lot of heavy metal that was recorded in the 70's before there were real subcategories of heavy metal this disc is definately a must. Similarly, if you have just a passing interest in heavy metal so far this is a must because it is relatively easy to listen to, but still kicks some serious ass even by 2005 standards. Buy this as soon as you can get a decent deal on it. Its a worthwhile addition to almost anyone's collection. I'm sure glad I bought it.
B000819PKC|4.0|I have dug Jamiroquai since Travelling Without Moving. Since then I have been a very big fan. Although I think Return of the Space Cowboy is the best Jamiroquai ever, you can't forget Emergency on Planet Earth, Synkronized, and Funk Odyssey.<br /><br />Dynamite took me back, some of the tunes I had to backtrack and really listen to what I was hearing. Seven Days in Sunny June has to be the best track on this CD, although I am hearing reminisence of Emergency all over this disc, almost seems like a regression back to the group's early roots.<br /><br />My co-workers (I work in a lab) never heard of Jamiroquai but I have made them admirers quickly when they have heard Dynamite, amongst the other Jamiroquai discs I have had the privilege to play.<br /><br />Maybe we should stop scrutinizing, even though we all have opinions...since I inadvertently did get the unexposed to dig this cd, maybe we're missing something.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This cd has got to be the oddest listen I've had in a while.  I almost gave up halfway through my first listen.  Stick with it, though, and you will be richly rewarded.  I consider this cd to be like fine wine -- it gets much better with time!  The songs here turn out to be so addictive, so different, that they play around in my head all day.  Please go buy it.  Your life will be changed.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I had the distinct pleasure of seeing this movie with an audience loaded with people who have never watched the Fox TV show Firefly (when it was on Fox or now that is on Sci-Fi Channel -plug,plug,plug..) and do not know how great a producer/writer Joss Whedon has shown himself to be (and a great comic writer, check out \\"Frey\\" at your local comic book store). <br /> <br />After the movie ended and the applause faded, Whedon won over another group of people to his camp. They saw what I saw: A nearly perfect movie from beginning to end - great screenplay, great acting; the correct mixture of drama, action and humor. To top it off, Serenity has a decent budget, the movie..looks..great! <br /> <br />One of the best films out this year.
0812550706|5.0|I'm too lazy to write a review for each book in this excellent series.  If you like this first book (I don't see how you won't), you'll want to get the whole series anyway.

B000AXSN5G|2.0|Bummer.  <br /> <br />Am I the first one to point out that \\"No Wonder\\" mercilessly steals the melody from \\"World on a String?\\" <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm doing what I did with Broken Arrow, Are You Passionate, Landing on Water, and Mirror Ball - teaching myself to like this album. Beacuse it's Neil, you know. And he's the king. And part of being a fan of Neil's is getting burned. But this is some third degree stuff here. Tepid, lifeless, by the numbers. Neil has never sounded so 'phoned in.' Auto-pilot. Take your pick from any of the rock crit cliches - this is grim.  <br /> <br />That said, aside from the production, some songs are quite nice the seventh time through. <br /> <br />I guess it's working.
1591391105|4.0|Well written, prompting the reader to evaluate pre-conceived notions of how to do their job, and how those notions may no longer be relevant or usefull following a promotion.  The first third of the book was extremely usefull, the rest was more standard business book fare.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed \\"Firefly\\" when it was a T.V. show.  I was already a Joss Whedon fan, having really enjoyed the Buffy/Angel saga (especially the first few years).  Sometimes it's hard for me to catch TV shows in the evening though, since I teach at two colleges and usually am gone several nights a week.  However, when one of my students (also a Buffy fan) offered to let me preview her Firefly collection, I jumped at the chance.  I was really going in cold, not knowing much about the series. <br /> <br />I started watching wioth the pilot episode.  I recognized some faces from Buffy/Angel - and there were some new ones.  I kept watching - about 10 or 15 minutes into it, I was going to leave and watch something else, when I was suddenly caught, riveted.  For the rest of the week, I fell headlong into the story, watched it through, then sat down and watched it again, roping as many of my family members in to watch with me as I could. <br /> <br />Joss creates this world filled with funny, lovable, fallable, wonderful characters.  They lapse from English into Chinese and back again at the drop of a hat.  They have created a family aboard a space-going ship, firefly class, named \\"Serenity.\\"  That wonderful mix of relationships is what Joss excels at - you care so much about them so quickly - you want to see what happens next. <br /> <br />I remember what happened with Star Trek - I can only hope that the series will live on - the movie \\"Serenity\\" was a wonderful stand-alone story that ties up a lot of loose ends from the series. <br /> <br />Get it - you won't be disappointed.

0307276902|3.0|he defintely had one thing right... its easier to make up your own punctuation and grammar as you go. much easier to write by just typing. i actually heard about this book originally in time magazine in april 2002 in a treatment facility waiting room. shortly afterwards i picked up the book and started reading it in while i was in rehab in kerville texas. it was a good book and an easy read. defintely entertaining and mind openning. as some other people already said it gets pretty slow and boring towards the middle. i did like others find myself skimming. while i was reading it i did think the guy had an inflated ego. the ending sucked for me and made me kinda angry cause it discounted the 12 step program that has kept me sober since april 2002. i don't know if it is a coincidence or what, but when i was done reading i let someone else read it in the 'hab, and shortly afterwards she bolted out with my book. I have love though for someone who is living clean even if its not the way i do it. after reading the book i hoped that he wouldn't use the fame and money to get throwed off on.
068987474X|5.0|When I started this book, I was expecting something other than what it was- what I was expecting? I don't know. But the book is excellent not just for females but for guys as well. It goes through those thoughts that most ladies have about a man and it shows what you should expect. I like that throughout the book, Greg is sure to let ladies know that they deserve someone who wants them and wants to treat them right! This is a great book for yourself or to give to a girlfriend!
B000005DQR|5.0|i first heard this album on the late night back when i was in middle school. it was on mtv's liquid telivision late one night. the video for midnight in a perfect world came on. it blew my mind and has been in constant rotation in my mind ever since. beautiful music. sounds groundbreaking and unbeleivable everytime i hear it. it is just beautiful music that can be played in any mood. i can relate hearing it to the first time i heard miles davis \\"kinds of blue\\"
0064400557|5.0|It's a beautiful story that lets you be a child but walks you to the next level.  I think shouldn't be missed in childhood and should be revisited in adulthood.  There's love, loayalty and the joy of childhood fantasy (i.e. loquacious and literate animals) but so much else exists in this \\"children's novel.\\"  Recognizing the value of a life no matter how small, agreeably dealing with personalities and temperaments other than your own, new vocabulary written right into the story, growing up and putting away childish things, savoring the fact that life goes on and can be richer than you imagined...  I could go on but suffice it to say this book is a charachter builder you and your children will love. <br /> <br />Fern is tenacious, Charlotte is wise, Wilbur is noble, Templeton is selfish, the geese are hilarious, the sheep can be snobbish and you love them all because they are real. <br /> <br />Enjoy.
0307276902|4.0|What disturbs me about this book is the possibility that some will interpret it as an option for addicts of all kinds to go it by themselves. To make up their minds they can lick this \\"disease\\" by just making the decision never to use again. Just in the outcomes of Frey's friends from rehab....the long term prognosis for maintaining sobriety is wickedly small. And all the repeated advice from counselors implied that he would never make it without AA and the Twelve Steps. It is important to know that AA and the Twelve Steps really are helping to keep a lot of folks clean and sober. I think it is also important to note that there are a lot of \\"dry drunks\\" out there who have made this decision to never use again but they still suffer from \\"stinkin thinkin.\\" Can it be so horrible a thing to humbly admit that you don't have all the answers. That you might need, once in a while, to defer (surrender) to something greater than yourself....a collective source of wisdom, be it Tao or whatever? Is is so impossible to enter into the kind of humility to be able to advance to those steps where we go back and attempt to make a real amends to whoever we can for the brutal things we have done in the past? I have to wonder if Mr. Frey is going to wake up one day and realize that he has more \\"recovering\\" to do besides just getting sober enough to write a bestselling book.  <br />Addendum....Having just reread the Tao Te Ching I am better able to understand why Frey rejects \\"God\\" in the traditional western sense. In the Tao we read that \\"the unnamable is the eternally real\\".....and that \\"the name that can be named is not the eternal name.\\" Much of what Frey apparently rejects about God and the Higher Power thing must be this business of \\"naming it.\\" I can understand that.  <br />
1400032717|5.0|My husband and I picked out this book to listen to on a long car trip.

This book strikes the perfect balance between serious and hilarious and it gave me new insight into autism.  I would definitely recommend it!
0156027321|3.0|I have some very mixed feelings about the Life of Pi by Yann Martel. This book provided some great points for discussion about religion and survival but enough is enough. I felt that it was overly graphic and at times plain nauseatingly repetitive. I loved the character of Pi and the way that the author used vivid description and bold actions to really make him breathe, but I was very disappointed that his later life character was not more fully developed. The ending of this book is very disappointing. I wanted to know about the effect of the journey on Pi's life as an adult and the effects on his children. Making the audience question the validity of the entire story was not a good move. It distracts from the essential ideas of the book of faith and survival. I would recommend this book to others but with a bad taste in my mouth. It is a good solid read with a disappointing ending so be prepared.
B0007XT87G|3.0|Porcupine Tree in 2005 bear almost no relation to the exciting band they used to be in the 90's, but after all, the whole music scene is entirely different. PT still offer albums of high quality, that are worth bying, but i still believe this \\"metal phase\\" is not their best.  <br />'Deadwing' is another step towards a sophisticated prog/metalish sound [call me Opeth...], but overall the album is inferior to 'In Absentia', it's actually a step back. <br />In recent years the band has followed the same way all bands with a keyboard player have followed in the past (notably Pink Floyd), that is, they replaced keyboards with more guitars. DeadWing is the definite example. <br />The first half of the cd is weak, the title track is Led Zeppelin circa 1976, the contribution of Adrian Belew doesn't fit so much, Lazarus is great (it's the mellotron!), and \\"Arriving...\\" is the typical lengthy-song-with-many-changes they specialize in. \\"Melotron\\" is a slow and quiet piece, but it has an original lyrical twist at the end, \\"Open car\\" is a desperate heavy pop song (but very short!). I think \\"Start of...\\" is by far the best track in here,epic and melancolic. <br />Summing up, the new thing in this album is a lyrical approach on some songs, and a sense of depression (perhaps because the album is a ST to a theatre play). The bad thing is that it's their most one-man-band album since \\"The sky moves sideways\\". <br />

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I just bought this album a few weeks ago (I'm about to buy their new one as well) and as the title suggests it  <br />is extraordinary. I only just bought this album because I was unsure about it when Take Me Out was  <br />released over here, but since Franz Ferdinand made Don't You Wanna Go (I know it's off their new album),  <br />I told myself I had to have this album, and the next. I am so glad I did too, because the music is again  <br />fabulous. It's catchy, and you find yourself wanting to sing along to all the songs even if you are only  <br />hearing them for the first time, and don't know the words. Sometimes it gets a little repetitive now and then,  <br />but most of the time that's what makes the song catchy in the first place. The band was also kind enough to  <br />put the lyrics in the CD's booklet. One of the many interesting things about Franz Ferdinand is that in about  <br />every song they start off with one tune, and rhythm, but then about 30 seconds into the song they suddenly  <br />change it to something completely different. Another point of interest about Franz Ferdinand is that you  <br />can't try to look at it, the first time you hear it, with a critic's eye because you will hate the CD. The critic's  <br />eye will come with listening to the songs a few times first; just sit back and enjoy the music the first time  <br />you hear the CD though. Now that I've said all that I would like to talk about each of the songs individually.  <br /> <br />1. Jacqueline: This song is a perfect example of the tune suddenly changing into something different. From  <br />the first 30 seconds of it (and from the title for that matter) you think it's going to be a slow song about a girl  <br />named Jacqueline. Afterwards though the bass gets into the song, and starts the \\"real\\",\\"first\\" lines of the  <br />song. The beat that goes on past the first verse is very catchy, and if you listen to the 30 second clip you will  <br />see a little of what I'm talking about. 30 seconds however is not enough to really get the feel of the song, I  <br />would say you need a good minute to really grab ahold of what the song is about. The song itself is about a  <br />group of bachelors or friends who like to take as much time to enjoy life as possible. This is all obvious  <br />once you hear the chorus \\"...It's always better on holiday, so much better on holiday. That's why we only  <br />work when we need the money...\\" The guitar work is top notch, and I think it was very smart how they  <br />disguised the \\"real\\" song. Overall I would give this song five stars, because it's smart, catchy, and not at all  <br />repetitive.  <br /> <br />2. Tell Her Tonight: This song is I think one of the smartest on the album. When you first hear it you may  <br />not even be able to understand the words, but just take one peek into the song booklet, and you'll see what  <br />it's about. The song as far as I can see is about a couple who want to have sex with each other for the first  <br />time. All the words are about the subtle hints they drop each other. Only the title makes this a little  <br />mysterious. Questions arise in your mind such as \\"What does he mean by 'Gonna have to tell her tonight?'\\"  <br />and when you first read, or hear the lyrics \\"Could he be a stalker?\\" The guitar work is about average for  <br />Franz Ferdinand, so there's not much more to say in that area. Keep in mind though that average for them is  <br />still very good. As a song I didn't much care for it, but the lyrics are what make it so good. Overall I would  <br />give this song four stars, the first three were because the song was not repetitive, and because it was a good  <br />song. The last star was because it was very smart, but since I didn't like it as much as the others on this  <br />album it didn't get a full five stars.  <br /> <br />3. Take Me Out: This of course is the song that most people have probably heard already, from this album.  <br/>It has been played on television, and the radio for a couple of reasons. The first reason is of course for the  <br />song, and musical purposes. The next reason was for commercial purposes. People have probably seen the  <br />PSP commercial where it seems that you are trapped inside the system, whilst different people play games  <br />on you. It is another example of how Franz Ferdinand change the tune in the middle of the song. If you  <br />know what I'm talking about please skip to the next description. For those of you who don't know, the song  <br />starts off with a fast rhythm, but slows down to the pace the band will use for the rest of the song. I like the  <br />way that the change the pace, and it is one of my favorites of this album. The guitar work is a little  <br />repetitive, but that is why it's catchy. Sometimes it can get annoying if you are singing along, when the  <br />chorus comes along because they take so much time before they finally get around to saying, \\"Take me  <br />out.\\" Overall I would give this song four stars. It would have received five stars, but the thing with the  <br />chorus, and it is a little repetitive. Just some tiny little things, but I will cut them some slack, and only take  <br />off one star because it's their first album.  <br /> <br />4. The Dark Of The Matinee: This is my favorite song from this CD. It's about a guy, in either High School  <br />or College who doesn't much care for schoolwork, and would much rather see a movie. He does however  <br />meet a girl who he falls in love with, and invites her to come to the Matinee with him. Whether she does go  <br />to the Matinee with him is unknown, but in the last verse he tells of how his life was hard when he met her,  <br />but it's easy now. The guitar work is pretty good, and this is one of the few songs that doesn't skip from one  <br />tune to the next. It gets a little repetitive now and then but for the most part it stays on a solid beat. One of  <br />the main reasons I think for the guitars being a little repetitive is that it sounds as though it's taken from an  <br />old traditional Scottish dance, and so maybe it was originally a bit repetitive to accommodate for the  <br />dancers. The fact that it doesn't skip from tune to tune doesn't diminish the appeal of the song though, in fact  <br />it enhances it somewhat, and makes it seem unique. It of course isn't unique in that respect, because of a  <br />number of other songs such as Tell Her Tonight, and Darts Of Pleasure, but I will get to that later. Overall I  <br />would give this song five stars; it's catchy, not too repetitive and it has that nice traditional sound to it.  <br /> <br />5. Auf Acshe: This song wasn't one that appealed to me very much. It is a good song, but I just don't like the  <br />type of Techno-ish dance music that this is. The song seems to be about a man admiring a woman, but for  <br />some reason he is stopped from being with her. Nothing in the song however gives any clue as to why he is  <br />stopped, but that kind of is the point of the song. It's mysterious, and somewhat dark-sounding, but overall  <br />pretty good. The guitar work could use some improvement, but this song didn't focus on guitars so much.  <br />As I said earlier it has that dark and mysterious quality, which is achieved by using a strings setting on a  <br />synthesizer. The way I see it though this is a very good song for the album because like Tell Her Tonight it  <br />adds a bit of variety by taking out the guitars a little, and replacing them with a synthesizer. Overall I would  <br />give this song five stars, because it's good, and it again adds some variety.  <br /> <br />6. I'm Cheating On You: This song like many others on this album is very smart. It is basically one big  <br />contradiction of itself, and with lines like \\"...Good-bye girl, because I love you...\\" that fact is very apparent.  <br />So many lines like that make the song seema little confusing after a little while, but that's mainly the point.  <br />It's about telling the person you love, that you are really in love with someone else. The guitar work is not  <br />repetitive at all, which makes it seem better than it is, although it's good to start with. Something about this  <br />song though just doesn't seem as good as most of the rest of the album, but it is smart none the less. Overall  <br />I would give this song four stars. Again it's there first album so there's bound to be room for improvement.  <br />This song still is as smart as the rest of the CD, which is a good thing. But hey there's always a few songs  <br />that you don't like on an album anyway, so it doesn't really matter if I don't think this song is as good. My  <br />opinion is final though, so on to the next song.  <br /> <br />7. This Fire: This song is very clever, because of the chorus. It's about a guy who is about to go out for a  <br />night on the town, but he says that he has a fire inside of him (metaphorically speaking of course). The  <br />chorus later goes on to say that the fire is out of control, and it's going to burn the city. Now I think that  <br />anybody with half, no a quarter of a brain can figure that one out. The chorus can be a little repetitive, but as  <br />I've said before it's there first album so I won't give the band too much grief for that. The guitar work is  <br />good, but of course that's good for them, because again they're good to start with. The chorus seemed to be  <br />a little faster than the verses, and it was interesting how they were able to put the two parts together in a  <br />logical way, whilst not subtracting from the music. It was just a little short for my tastes, and I think it may  <br />have benefited from at least one more verse. Overall I would give this song five stars. Although it's a little  <br />repetitive it's catchy, and I suppose it's meant to be a dance song, so being repetitive is not without  <br />justification. The clever metaphor of the chorus was really what won this five stars though, even if the  <br />metaphor is a commonly used one Franz Ferdinand took it a little bit further than it has been taken before.  <br /> <br />8. Darts Of Pleasure: This song is another one of my favorites. The music focuses almost solely on the  <br />guitars, which, unlike other bands is a little unusual for Franz Ferdinand. The words to the verses have an  <br />interesting touch to them. They seem to be about a woman who is just pure evil, but a closer look at the  <br />lyrics reveals that it is not talking about the woman, but the person, or thing, responsible for bringing the  <br />woman into the world to begin with. Since the music is almost completely tied in with the guitars the guitar  <br />work is good. It really portrays a feeling of great anger towards this thing who sends or sells this evil  <br />woman. Although it is a good song it does have it's bad points. For one I didn't like the length of it, it was  <br />again just too short for me. This song was another one that could have benefited from a few extra verses.  <br />Overall I would give this song five stars. The clever disguising of the real subject is something I'm fond of,  <br />and this song gave it to me. It wasn't repetitive at all, so that's very good.  <br /> <br />9. Michael: This song is yet again very clever. It is about two men dancing together in a dance club, the  <br />only thing is that there are no women with them. What is the only conclusion you can reach then? Well the  <br />answer is that they're both gay. All the words talk about how the one man cannot stand to live without the  <br />other. Of course it does this in a way that is mainly seen as taboo, which makes it clever. The music is good  <br />switching from the fast-paced chorus to the slower verses, and this is another one of the songs that is not  <br />repetitive in the least. Although it only has two verses itwas strangely just the right length for me. Overall I  <br />would give this song five stars, mainly because of the content. Normally in a song like this you would be  <br />talking about a girl being the only thing a man can't be without. Making it a guy was all to clever, and I  <br />applaud the mind(s) who thought that one up.  <br /> <br />10. Come On Home: This song is another one of my favorites. It is again basically one big contradiction.  <br />All the verses consist of a man begging his girlfriend to come home, but he also says for the girl to stay  <br />away because he likes being lonely. It has a very meloncholy sound to it, and does a good job of making it  <br />sound as if the guy really wants his girlfriend back with him. As some other people have mentioned the  <br />guitars are a little weak in this song, but that is sort of the point. The reall instrument is the organ, which has  <br />the moving part all throughout the song. I also liked how the band was able to join together the two  <br />instruments so well. This song also wasn't repetitive at all so that was a definite plus. Overall I would give  <br />this five stars, because of Franz Ferdinand's ability to make the song sound as if the guy wants his girlfriend  <br />back. It's only when you look deep into the song that you see the real purpose, and content.  <br /> <br />11. 40': This song is another very good song. It is the only one on the album that I can't figure out the  <br />meaning of. All the lyrics are almost completely nonsensical. Talking about salt drying on this guys arms,  <br />and having the sun burn it off, first off that's gross, and second WHAT?!! The guitar work is good however,  <br />and more than makes up for the fact that the lyrics are an enigma wrapped in a mystery and topped off with  <br />a big question mark. The solo at the beginning of the song does sound a little like pick-axes chipping away  <br />at some stone in a quary, so maybe that's what it's about. Whichever way you look at it though it is still a  <br />good song and I give it five stars.  <br /> <br />Overall I would say that this is a great album. Although there are a few songs that are better than others that  <br />is true of any album and you shouldn't judge by that. As for being repetitive in places, I say that since it's  <br />their first album the band is allowed to make some mistakes [just don't do it again (just kidding!)]. In  <br />conclusion I think that anyone who likes good music should buy this album, even if you've already bought  <br />their second one.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|Something new from EC,again mellowing with age. <br />He always comes through.
B00006IU73|5.0|I first saw PT two years ago when they toured with Opeth.  I had only heard one tune from PT (Strip the Soul), and I figured they would be worth checking out.  After the show, we thought their performance was so excellent, that my wife and I bought this CD for $10.  I've spent $10 on a lot of things, but never has something been so worth it before. <br /> <br />  I am a big fan of those quiet, genious, mastermind artists that crank out music because they actually enjoy it and have something to say (i.e. Devin Townsend).  The frontman for PT is one of these people. <br /> <br />Anyhow, you could classify PT as \\"progressive hard rock\\", but that is really a shallow description.  There are elements of many other musical genres (as others have said) and they all blend together nicely.  The guitars are clean and groovy, and they aren't afraid to whip out some heavy, power-chorded riffs.  There are just enough crunchy, heavy and softer tunes on this album for anyone that enjoys real music.  The vocal melodies can be both creepy and moving at the same time. The music is pleasing to listen to, and it's plainly obvious that each member is a professional musician.  There's no cheapness to this album.  You can sense the perfection they were striving for.  The production quality is excellent; everything sounds great.  The songs and lyrics are both sad and inspiring.  Every time I listen to this album, I get a different feeling.  <br /> <br />Get the DTS/DVD version of this for an extra treat.  We ended up buying that version a year later just for the bonus tracks and DTS track. <br /> <br />As a result of this album, we have now purchased many other PT albums and been to two more shows.  Do yourself a favor and see PT live (they are currently touring America!) to understand this band fully.   <br /> <br />So, turn off that crappy, radio \\"mainstream\\" trash and enlighten your mind with PT.
1573223026|3.0|I have loved Hornby for years now, ever since \\"High Fidelity\\" reinvigorated my love for modern fiction. His newest work, \\"A Long Way Down\\", doesn't disappoint and is a good, quick read. While the subject matter of the book, suicide in the face of the banality of modern life, is reather heavy-- the tone is light and humourous. The book isnt quite as engaging or hilarious as Hornby's first two works (About a Boy and High Fidelity), but it is certainly worth your time. <br /> <br />The author tells the story through four different narrorators, all of whom went to the top of a building on New Years Eve, planning to off themselves. While having little in common, the four eventually become a support group for each other, and they all learn alot about themselves and life through the stories and actions of the others. <br /> <br />My main problem with the story is in that I didnt really care for two of the four characters. I don't mean that Hornby didnt make them all likeable, because he did, I just mean that a couple of them were rather boring and inconsistant. <br /> <br />The best character is without a doubt Martin, who will remind you of the lead in Hornby's first two books. He wants to die because he was a British celebrity who has been shamed and lost everything because of a sex scandal. The emotions that Martin feels are real and powerful, and you can tell that Hornby put alot of himself into this character. A lot of the books most powerful ideas center around Maureen, the single mother with the disabled child who occupies her entire life. It is impossible, altho not necessarily all that believable, to hear about her sad and lonely life and how she has been able to survive this long. <br /> <br />The other two characters, I didnt like as much. JJ, who is an American musician, is a complete bore. Maybe he is meant as the character who is guys like me are supposed to identify the most with, but nothing that he says or does is especially interesting. Generally, when Iwas reading the parts of the story told by him, I was just waiting to get to the next section. The fouresome is completed by Jess, who is a drama queen in the highest fashion, and is completely out of control. I thought that she was a little bit overdone at times, altho in the latter part of the book she begins to behave a little bit more like an actual human being. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book, and it did get me thinking and talking about some issues. There really isnt much action in the story, but action is not Hornby's specialty. It is the magic of his dialogue that keeps this book interesting, and this is where Hornby is a genuis.

B0000UJDLM|5.0|I have not seen this movie for a while, but from what I remember it could easily be in the top 100 best all time movies. I liked Ally in the breakfast club, and even more in this movie sense she plays someone more sane and normal. This movie is funny and it is something different from the usual, even though technology and technical movies are more common today then they were back when this movie came out. Perhaps at the core of us we all try to tame the technology the way Ally tries to get the robot in this movie under control.
0316168815|1.0|...significantly lacking in depth and emotion. The book starts out interesting enough, with Susie Salmon narrating the tale of her murder and watching over her family (and others left on earth) from heaven. But, it loses momentum quickly due to poor character development. I read all 300+ pages of this book - and fairly quickly at that, but I just could not empathize or rejoice with the members of Susie's family as they moved through their lives.     The plot concept had great potential, with lots of room to delve into the emotions of a family dealing with senseless tragedy in its immediacy and over the course of their lives. However, the author did not make me care about the characters filling most of the pages; she did not tap into the emotional and psychological potential that could have been achieved with this premise.     For me, it was a huge disappointment. I simply do not understand all the rave reviews and the bestseller status of this book. In fact, I disliked it so much in the face of such praise that I felt compelled to write this, my first review on Amazon.
B0009X7664|5.0|This movie shows how people act different when they are a part of a group, from the way they relate to others as individuals. This is a classic movie (or book) that is wonderful for a group discussion at school. It should be required reading or a required movie for everyone to see. Followed by extensive conversation so they could begin to understand what they saw. I do not know of any movie or book that handles the subject matter as well as this one does. It leads the way so that others can only follow.
B0007XT7V8|3.0|this album just isn't as good as theory's s/t debut. of the 12 songs on here, only 7 or 8 are worth a listen, and the rest are fillers. it's too bad they got rid of chad kroeger for production, cuz' howard benson just doesn't work well with their music. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying gasoline, but just know that its not going to be as good as s/t. pretty good, but after 5 or 6 listens, i was done with it. get s/t instead if you're a new fan.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The magical wondrous mind of Joss Wheadon is all over this series. Original, witty, clever and full of pathos, either it will make you want to see the movie (see it before it leaves the theatre) or the movie will have already brought you here. You won't be disappointed. If you thought you saw the series, television didn't do it justice by presenting the episodes out of order. They are here now as they were meant to be seen, with additional episodes never seen on tv.  Enjoy! I know you will. Maybe the powers that be will see they made a mistake and bring the series back.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|this is the best system of a down album ever. track after track i dont know how hypnotize is going to top it. this is way better than any wierd al song i have ever heard. the best songs are all of them like violent pornography..B.Y.O.B is also a very good song i even have it as one of my ring tones every body i talk to when system of a down is brought up every body ends up talking about how good this album is. its so good im listening to it while writing this review. when i bought this cd i took it to school it was in my cd player somebody broke into my locker and stole the cd player with this cd in it so i have had to buy this album twice. it was worth every penny spent on it too. if you are in to crazy songs about politics and chocking chicks then this album is for u or if you are a big SYSTEM OF A DOWN fan!!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|If that title makes you think you know what to expect from this movie, you should actually watch this movie before passing judgement. I didn't really know what to expect from the movie when I went to see it in theatres. I saw the preview and thought it looked interested, so when time came for it to be released, I found myself at the AMC 24 checking it out. And let me just say I am extremely glad I did. \\"Underworld\\" was more than a pleasant surprise, and in turn became one of my favorite movies of 2004. If you're into action, love stories, vampires, werewolves, or all of the above, then this movie was made for you to enjoy. <br /> <br />\\"Underworld\\" follows Celine (Kate Beckinsdale), a sexy vampire whose in the midst of a war with the Lycans. The goal of both the Lycans and the Vampires, is to exterminate the other side. No one really knows why the war was started, or how long it's been going on, all they really know is the other race is the enemy, and it's their job to get rid of them. However quickly into the movie, you'll discover that there is foul-play going on between Vampire and Lycan leaders, furthering the depth of the plot. Celine's romance with a human, recently turned Lycan does nothing to help the matter. Start to finish I found the movie very interesting, especially the fight scenes and special effects. There's plenty for action and horror fans a like to find in this movie, and that's why it's a recommended must see to any of those people. The Unrated extended cut is the essential version of the movie, as it further develops characters in the movie, and has an extended final fight sequence. The ending is kind of a cliff-hanger, so can we expect an Underworld 2? One can only hope. <br /> <br />All in All there's no reason to not buy the DVD if you liked the movie, especially the Unrated extended cut. If you liked it before, I think you will be more than satisfied with the purchase of this DVD. If you didn't catch it in theatres, then this is a great opportunity to get a great movie. I highly recommmend it to fans of action or horror. Definitely if you're a Resident Evil fan this is worthy of checking out. So don't let your blood run cold, and miss out on this one.
B00079FUI6|1.0|I can't believe this! How can people actually love this show? It doesn't make sense! Have any of the creators of these shows ever heard of the word IMAGINATION? Obviously not because none of them have any of it. This show sucks beyond my own words. I'd give it zero stars if I had to. It's not like this show happens in real life, does it? Gimme a break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've seen better shows than this, and they have something that this show doesn't have: IMAGINATION!
B00005KKAQ|5.0|I picked this album up several years ago while in Spain, and was blown away.  Simply a great collection of live performances by the Doors.  Being a big fan, but far too young to have seen them live, I have to settle for tidbits like this to get a taste for their live performances.  The variety of different venues is nice as well, and I believe it is certainly a pick of the best live performances.  I highly recommend this collection for any Doors fan, especially if you're not quite ready to put out big bucks for the more expensive Bright Midnight Label releases.
B00007G207|5.0|Watching this movie was a very unique experience. This movie is not just about the magic of cinema but the magic of childhood's memories. For Toto these memories were made of the local movie theater, his friendship with Alfredo, and the movies he was watching there. After I watched this movie my childhood's memories had come back to me, which made this movie very special and very precious to me. At the end when he goes back to his village and he sees the movie theater being a parking lot is something I have experienced also, in my city (Athens, Greece). This is a apt symbol of how the careless years of  childhood are gone along with people, places or situations enjoyed. And when  he watches on the screen Alfredo's gift to him (all the censored kisses from movies) is a touching ending depicting that even now someone can take confort and enjoyment from nice moments of the past. Moments that are so well hidden as were all this kissing scenes in Alfredo's box. Please watch this movie and bring back the pleasant memories of your childhood, even the one that are hidden very deep in you.
0312995423|2.0|The plot is simple and the research is shallow. Digital Fortress is easy to pick up and easy to put down. <br /> <br />The book begins like a romance novel. A central character of the book, David Becker, is described as \\"dark-rugged, youthful ... sharp green eyes and wit to match. His strong jaw and taut features reminded Susan (heroine cryptographer for the NSA) of carved marble.\\" Becker, a brilliant foreign language specialist and full professor, has no clue who or what the NSA might be - that is a mere nine pages into the book. <br /> <br />The end of the modern world is at hand. First, because the NSA won't be able to sneak a look at everyone's secrets due to a do-gooder's efforts (misguided of course) to share his unbreakable code. Second, because - well, I won't ruin the story. <br /> <br />Author Dan Brown of The Da Vinci Code, Deception Point and Angels & Demons, fails to provide any real insight into the workings of the NSA, its computers or cryptology. <br /> <br />Digital Fortress was entertaining, but simple. It could have been so much more.   <br /> <br />Two stars. <br />
0312330537|4.0|\\"Shantaram\\" is oversized in every sense - it's too long, the prose is too purple, it contains too many incidents, it reaches for but doesn't attain cosmic importance, and all its characters are giants.  And then, finally, it's undersized in that the ending falls flat, because the title character's redemption is telescoped from page one.  But, with all that, it's pretty much a good read because Gregory David Roberts knows, loves, and can write about Bombay specifically, and India in general, and takes us places in India's heart we'd never get to on our own.
0671042858|5.0|I read some of these reviews before the book and they really put the book down. But, I enjoyed the book, it is a good story with heart. Don't listen to anybody else, if you want to read a good story, that moves right along I recommend this book with high honors.
B000059QYB|4.0|This is what I heard regarding the choice to put \\"Dont You Forget About Me.\\" Supposedly the record execs had wanted Billy to do this song when The Breakfast Club came out but he was either unwilling or simply couldn't do the song at the time. I imagine that he regretted doing the song considering that it became so popular. I think this was his tribute to Simple Minds. I love Billy Idol, but in regards to this song, I think I prefer Simple Minds
0140177396|5.0|Of mice and men is a classic that will remain in our hearts forever. This is a tale about two friends, Lennie, who is big and strong but suffers from a mental deficiency, and George, the guy who always gets Lennie out of trouble. George wishes he didn't have to deal with Lennie's persistent knack of getting them fired from their work, but on the other side he and Lennie had always been together since Lennie's aunt died. This is a nice short read for people looking for good writing. Steinbeck puts great detail into character development and attitude. The characters in this book I find all have their own unique qualities, even the minor characters. George and Lennie are a perfect example of a ragtag duo seeking work. I hope this book will impress you as much as it did me.
B0009WFFS6|3.0|I have to deduct one star for the songs they didn't include, namely \\"Strange Brew\\", \\"Tales of Brave Ulysees\\", \\"I Feel Free\\", and \\"Swlabr\\".  I would have prefered those over outtakes of the same songs that were already included, and \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\".  Its okay on the original CD, as a novelty item, but it doesn't exactly JAM, does it?  And while \\"Stormy Monday\\" is one of the greatest blues songs of all time, and this version  features a great guitar solo, it's already been done to death by everyone from the Allman Brothers to Eva Cassidy.<br /><br />The most disapponting track, in my opinion, is \\"Crossroads\\".  Compare this \\"laid back version\\" to the manic, seat of your pants '67 version.  Pick up the tempo, guys.<br /><br />I also have to deduct one star for the dreadful cinematography.  The cameras consistently go in and out of focus.<br /><br />Other than that, its great.  I got my wish.
B00004RITP|4.0|I can't support the view that the Mahler Tenth feels complete.  What we have is one great movement that is fully completed, the opening Adagio, followed by an almost complete one (the third movement Purgatorio), and three  problematic movements in bare sketches.<br /><br />They are so problematic that Leonard Bernstein, Solti, Abbado, Kubelik, Karajan, and other prominent Malherians have declined to conduct any of the completions done by Deryck Cooke or his half dozen successors. Cooke did a wonderful job with what he had, but the mystery is why the Adagio is so obviously great while the remaining sektches aren't.<br /><br />The Purgatorio movement doesn't give us a totally convincing picture. The finale is quite skeletal; Cooke had to work from a two-stave piano score. Either Mahelr was going to write in a mode much sparer than any he had ever used before, or his inspiration was flatging, which is entirely possible from a severely ill, depressed composer.<br /><br />It's amazing than even these sketches can sound so good. Rattle gives a totally committed performance of the Tenth, probably the best on records.  The Berlin Phil. plays with its customary virtuosity, even though EMI hasn't come up with the best sound; it's fairly thin, distant, and wiry in the upper registers of the violins. I am glad to have thids CD, but I don't think the Tenth is complete or a masterpiece, one movement aside.
B0009WFFS6|3.0|Indeed, you can never go back.  The pressure to to be THE three best at their instuments in the late 60's is gone.  No more Jack Bruce manic bass lines to challenge Clapton to excel, no more innovative extended jams, no Marshall stacks, no Gibsons by Clapton...no fire, no excitement.  Even Clapton's mainstream signature song with the band, Crossroads, is once again reduced to the same plodding exercise he has made it since the band's demise.  Bruce and Clapton never got along too well \\"back then\\", which contributed to some musical tension of sorts as well.  You can hear and feel that tension, that pressure to step up on the original recordings.  That's all in the past.  The one positive for me on this DVD is Ginger Baker, as he shows he can not only hold his own with any drummer today, but can still outdo most.  I generously give this performance three stars, but a blaze of past glory is sorely missed.  Just put another log on the fireplace and settle back in your favorite chair.
B0007GAERG|4.0|I remember when I first heard \\"Vision of Love.\\"  I was in college...  It was 1990.  I was in love.  Mariah's soaring voice seemed to echo the expansive and passionate feelings that were in my own heart.  I bought the cassette and became a Mariah fan. <br /> <br />But most romances end, or at least fade. I was with Mariah's next couple of albums, and then things went terribly wrong after \\"Butterfly.\\"   <br /> <br />And so, I was thrilled when Mariah's \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" got good early buzz. It was almost like I was cheering for her -- someone my own age who had been tested by the trials and tribulations of life.  Number one album!  Number one single!  Go, Mimi!  Go, Mimi!  I was almost afraid to buy the CD lest I be disappointed. <br /> <br />I have not been disappointed.  The tracks are great...  I especially like \\"Mine Again,\\" \\"Say Something,\\" and \\"If you Only Knew.\\"  The singles that have made her a hitmaker again are pretty good, too.   <br /> <br />In a way, I wish Mariah would grow up a little more:  get out of the club, put a stopper on the Barcardi...  But, <br />perhaps \\"Emancipation\\" is about as mature as she is going to get for now.  At least the \\"Glitter\\" and \\"Charmbracelet\\" days are over!  Even her look is less candy-cane and more classic and mature. <br /> <br />So, Mimi, I am back on board with you...  Here's to \\"Emancipation!\\"
