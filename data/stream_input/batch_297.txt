1587990717|5.0|Clearly this book rubs many people the wrong way. Taleb does not have too much respect for many icons like Warren Buffet (balanced with his worship of Karl Popper or Robert Shiller). He can particularly scathe the reader who was successful (as witnessed by many anonymous lashing at him in here). But he can also soothe many people to whom fate did not deliver a good life (without it being a fault of theirs).<br />At another level, this book is not for engineers --or those whose identification of probability lies in the mere computation of the stupid thing. In that respect Taleb has nothing to do with Paulos or Bernet or these mathematicians. His interpretation of probability is SKEPTICISM first and last. he explicitly shows that the important probabilites for him are NOT COMPUTABLE; he focuses on the Black Swan (the rare event) and his devastating effect --Taleb has been known to be the opponent of financial engineering...<br />In addition engineers like nerdy expositions lined up as in a textbook. Many are irritated at his literary treatment of the topic. <br />Finally Taleb engages himself. If I had to say that he has ego, it is owing to the confidence one has to have to display his own failures. He shows the reader that he is a fool of randomness &quot;the fool of all fools&quot;. I can't believe someone can be called arrogant for explaining his dealing with cancer or his inability to control his emotions. <br />Small time engineers should read Paulos etc (only one chapter overlaps with the themes). Taleb is a thinker of probability. His competition is Keynes (Treatise on Probability), Isaac Levi (Gambling with Chance), and the literature on scepticism.
B00008O0WN|5.0|I rated this DVD for it best picture of the year because it was great I enjoyed it so much, I think that people should give it five stars for it proformence and a great cast and the end of one most important character but it was realy great for trekers out there who will love this film.
B000002WU9|5.0|This album has so many wu tang members puttin it down that it is a little hard to tell it is Raekwon's solo album. Ghostface actually raps as much as Raekwon on the cd. Hey, who the hell cares, the cd is amazing and that is all that matters. Not only are the raps classic wu tang hottness, but the beats are RZA's BEST. No other Wu album (I have 7 of them) surpasses this one as far as beats go. IT IS THAT GOOD. Besides the production, Raekwons rhymes are needle sharp as always. BEST TRACKS: Lyrical Intercourse, Guillotine, Rainy Days, Wu gambinos. Peace.
B00005JLSC|4.0|I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones and she does an amazing job in this film.  I was amazed at how good a voice she has not to mention her amazing dancing ability.  The same can be said for Gere and Zellweger.  John C. Reilly plays the biscuithead husband exceptionally well and Queen Latifah is really good as Big Mama, her solo scene in a gold lame dress brings new definition to the word: decollatage!
0385484518|3.0|Mitch Alboms deeply personal work is the story of a journalist who rediscovers an old college professor, Morrie, who is dying of ALS (Lou Gehrigs disease).  The book encompasses a series of successive Tuesday visits Mr. Albom made to Morrie in order to get to know him.  Over the course of these visits, Mr. Albom learns a few things about Life (family, career, love, etc.) from the older, gentler and wiser Morrie.<br /> <br />Mr. Albom appears to go through a life transformation as he starts to discover the truer meanings of life.  More specifically he sees a kind man degenerate before his eyes to the point where Morrie can no longer perform basic bathroom duties without assistance.  Through the observations and conversations, Mr. Albom starts to recognize that the pursuit of money, career, etc. is not as important as spending time with his loved ones.<br /> <br />Such an axiom is nothing new.  I would even argue that a lot of people already know this.  But how does one adopt that philosophy and practice it?  Clearly, Mr. Albom wants to share this life revelation with his readers but ultimately in the end, the book comes up short.  While Albom means well, the chapters are trite and lacking depth.  It is wonderful that Mr. Albom has benefited from his Tuesdays with Morrie but in order for people to realize whats important to them, they will need to find their own Morrie.
6304595247|5.0|Anyone who loves a twisted tale of romance and revenge will find this video to be an excellent example of just that. It boasts a wonderfully brooding soundtrack that moves the soul and a cast of actors highlited by Ralph Finnes and Juliet Binoche who give excellent portrayals of the Heathcliff and Cathy Ernshaw.<br /> Juliette Binoche captures the viewers heart as both Cathy Earnshaw and her daughter Catherine Linton. Ralph Finnes gives a convincing portrayl of Heathcliff. His portrayal is enough to excite the viewer into goosebumps as he appears absolutely malevolent. In this film Ralph Finnes is a true Heathcliff.<br /> Although the story is dark, the ending was done in such a way that the viewer feels at ease with the rollercoaster of love and revenge that swarm throughout the film. It is altogether an excellent video that is truely worth owning.

B0000013GT|5.0|OK, I have to say that all other outkast albums are sub-par in my opinion. But this album is different; for one thing, the beats are their best and their lyric's are the deepest on this cd. If you must listen to only a few of the tracks they would be ATLiens, Jazzy Belle, Elevators, Wheels of Steel.
B00005JLS0|2.0|Sometimes a bubblegum movie is old bubblegum, tired and chewy and not very sweet.  This movie has all the pieces but doesn't have any zing to it, any purpose.  They go back and forth a little bit but they never truly convinced me that they were in love or their love was in danger.  Alicia Witt, a superb actress didn't really have much to do in thsi film and Hugh Grant's bumbling charm boy routine is wearing thin.<BR>I'm not sure about Bullock, she's filling a niche I'm sure.  Doing films that appeal to her, that she gets paid a lot for, that help employ a lot of people.  But I'm not qute sure if she's developing further along as an actress, if she's willing to take a risk and do something edgey or different or challenging.  She just seems to be the best at the romantic comedy pairings movie of the season.  Hopefully she'll start getting better choices.

With that said I must tell everyone that this album has gotten more time in my stereo than any other. It defies description- I cannot express the poetic flows Nasty Nas throws on the mellow beats laid down on the cd. I do not have a favorite track because, well, all the tracks are crazy. Peace.
B00005JLXC|3.0|The movie was ok, the whole mythos of Daredevil being secondary to Spiderman, the Hulk, the XMen-----no one ever screams \\"We need back-up, bring in Daredevil!\\"  Ben Affleck does a pretty good job as the sightless superhero and Colin Farrell is good as Bullseye too.  Jennifer Garner is.....passable as Elektra.  But you can't fault that she has the physical chops to play the part.  Jon Favreau is funny as Foggy Nelson, Matt Murdocks best friend and lawyer partner and Michael Duncan Clarke makes a fun Kingpin.<BR>The movie is ok but its like everyone is doing their \\"superhero\\" movie.  The stunts are fun and Daredevil's radar vision is interesting but its not the best superhero movie I've seen.  Honestly I'm not sure which is.
0393317552|5.0|I once saw Jared Diamond referred to as the current Jedi Master of human history, and from this important and influential book it's easy to see why. In \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" Diamond lays out a grand unifying theory of human history that is as powerfully explanatory as evolutionary theory is for the diversity of species. In doing so, he provides a model for a much deeper understanding of all human history.<br />The title is a reference to the proximate (immediate) factors--of which guns, germs and steel are just a few--that have resulted in the triumph of certain societies over others. It's a catchy title, but it doesn't reflect the true thrust of the book, which is demonstrating how ultimate factors like the availability of domesticable plants and animals and the geographic ease of technology and foods diffusion led to more dense and complex societies and eventually to those factors that helped some societies engulf others through conquest or other means. In other words, it's ultimately all about the real estate.<br />To argue his thesis, Diamond draws on a wealth of history, genetics, linguistics, archeology, and other disciplines to create an unprecedented synthesis. Maybe you're familiar with much of the material presented here, but when put together so coherently in the service of his theory, it is incredibly illuminating. Most readers won't have even thought of the important questions about our world that the author answers so convincingly.<br />The book isn't perfect. Diamond likes to drive home his points through repetition, which aids in retention but can get tiring. The organization could have been a little better, and a considerable amount of material not directly related to his thesis could have been trimmed off.<br />But this book gets my highest rating because it successfully explains the broadest trends, patterns and processes of human history, and provides a foundation essential for understanding why things are as they are today. It deserves all the critical and popular acclaim it's received.

0446608955|4.0|Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan were from two different sides of the world.  Landon, needing a date for a dance asked Jamie, little did he know that he would fall in love with her.  And fall in love he did.  Jamie, though has a secret she must share with the man she loves back.<br />Nicholas Sparks was born on December 31, 1965 in Omaha, NE.  He writes mostly love stories, after failing a couple of times at writing horror novels.  After failing he had to do a couple of other jobs, but he didn't let his failure stop him from writing.  He eventually teamed up with Billy Mills for the novel Wokini: A Lakota Journey to Happiness and Understanding.  He didn't stop there though, the first book he wrote that got published was The Notebook, a best seller.  His success continued with many other best sellers.<br />Normally when a movie is taken from a book people say they like the book better than the movie.  With this book though it was different for me.  True, the book was more descriptive and it did tell the real meaning of the book and brought out the theme, but after having watched the movie already too many times to count I just couldn't like the book more than the movie.  Although I liked the book and I couldn't put it down I think I compared it too much to the movie and didn't like it as much.  The book was good though.  Jamie is the type of person who others would like to be around, always happy, willing to help, your all around good girl.  She does also have the qualities that from first looking at her and seeing what she wears and looking at the Bible she always carries around with her everyone sees her as &quot;strange.&quot;  Landon, is your typical high school guy.  His father feels the need for him to become student body president, so he gives it a try, almost reluctantly and he ends up winning.  Along with being a typical high school guy he goes to his classes, does his presidential duties, and thinks that Jamie is strange.  On the last page of the prologue the narrator, Landon, tells us &quot;First you will smile, and then you will cry&quot; and this is so true.narrator, Landon, tells us &quot;First you will smile, and then you will cry&quot; and this is so true.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Lets get right to the point, Gza is absolutely the best lyricist in the Clan. It is no suprise that he was in the clan from the beginning. Much like Cuban Linx by Raekwon is about RZA's hott beats, this is the Wu album which showcases the Wu's best lyrics (excluding the genius 36 chambers). Best tracks: Liquid Swords, Duel of the Iron Mic. Peace.
B000078DOI|5.0|I bought all 4 reissues and this is definetly the best. Track 17 is an amazing jam. It's worth the price just for that. the new 24 bit remastering makes everything sound so much crisper. the extended version of \\"Sexy Mexican Maid\\" is great. it's a great piece of funk without the reverb. I've owned all the originals, but felt compelled to pick these reissues up. This years their 20th anniversary, and their's no better way to celebrate than to rediscover these classics. But where is \\"show me your soul?
B00008AY3L|5.0|I know what I like. And I like this album, particularly the first 3 tracks, but only because I am having a hard time not listening to them to get to the rest.  I have read other reviews in which this album was criticized for being \\"inconsistent\\" or eclectic, but that is a closed mind speaking.  This album reminds me, and has been compared to both here and in magazine reviews, in that respect of Paul Simon's Graceland.  It's range is why it is such a good album.
B000001IQH|4.0|I give this CD 3.5 stars. I didn't know whether to put 3 or 4, but seeing as it was my beloved Rancid, I decided on 4. I love Rancid, and I love all of their albums, except this one, which I just LIKE. Don't get me wrong . . . I have played this album repeatedly since I got it, but there are a few songs I always skip (particularly the HORRIBLE Maxwell Murder, which doesn't even sound like Rancid), whereas with the other albums, there is not a single bad track. The album in general though, is good - quite fast paced, REAL punk, with some good ska thrown in too. As Wicked, The War's End, and Roots Radicals are probably the best tracks. I can also appreciate Ruby Soho, although it sounds a little bit more commercial (but not poppy) than the usual Rancid. So, you should buy Out Come The Wolves, but buy Rancid's other albums first.
B00000016P|5.0|The Doors broke new ground once again, this time releasing a collection of songs some may feel is uneven; but this one pays great dividends the more you listen to it; myself I only half-listened for years, but just recently, finally put forth the effort. Though initially not all the tunes seemed melodically accessible - after I invested a bit more time and sensibility, the dividends started to accrue in a dramatically meaningful fashion.<br />The way the engineer manages to allow all the instruments and the vocals to be heard and still maintain the Doors' signature murky sound is amazing. But it would be nothing if the musicians didn't allow every part/moment to dovetail together. Robby Krieger brilliantly re-invents the guitar (tonally, melodically, and harmonically) on every song, as well as on every instrumental break of \\"When the Music's Over\\", the long song/poem which closes out album. Ray Manzarek counters with mostly organ, but at times barroom piano or harpsichord. From him, also, you don't hear the same kinds of riffs or the same sound palette from song to song. And at times, each will be heard overdubbing a part with a different tonal setting, melody and rhythm, panned to the opposite side of the stereo field. So you'll have two organs, or else two guitars riffing off of each other, while Morrison's vocal pleads/saddens/exults/growls/hovers/screams somewhere in between.<br />On the cover is a blue-tinted photograph of all these animated circus performers (somewhat reminiscent of Picasso's more quiescent painting of the \\"Family of Saltimbaques\\" from his Rose Period - the record is indeed the quintessential dark metaphysical/emotional/visceral circus. 'Sergeant Pepper' and 'The United States of America' may have started the carnival ball rolling . . . 'Strange Days' and [Procol Harum's] 'Shine On Brightly' rolled the big sonic circus ball underground, undersea, into heaven and hell and all points between.<br />[The song ] \\"Strange Days\\" is the perfect beginning for what's to come [like a giant violet-and-gold-hued moth emerging from its chrysalis in the dead of night]. Ray Manzarek switches drawbars on his Hammond B-3 organ every four beats of the repeating ostinado introduction, creating a luscious viscerally appealing four-bar lead in. The three instrumentalists working in tandem generate an unbelievably inventive melodic/harmonic sound space. Morrison, when he reprises a verse does it differently each time,<br />with intensely emoted melodic inversions, submersions, etc. His voice is fed through an electronic delay box (emerging ~½ beat late) and through some sort of weird combo algorithm of distortion/reverb/tremelo, then panned slightly left of his real vocal sound, the whole which further augments the already disjointed, mysterious atmosphere. The bassist has the main melody during instrumental breaks - the organ plays chord changes over his expressive (almost meandering) ostinado pattern. Even the drums are melodically impressionistic, in addition to providing the usual function of sonic timekeeping.<br />Every song has something very different to say, both musically and lyrically. And the message, the poetry is, to my mind, moving and profound. Listen to the meaning of the words with your heart - your mind and possibly your life will never be the same. When Jim is singing about something that enrages him, the emotion is obvious; and when he sings about something that is sad or saddening to him, you hear the empathy in his voice.

B00007E8V4|4.0|System of a Down was one of the biggest suprises of late 2001 and 2002. Before they immensley popular \\"Toxicity\\" was released, their self-titled debut was mainly an underground album, and SOAD's music seemed...how should I say this...\\"strange\\" or \\"odd\\" as compared to other bands because of the bizarre and often humerous singing and complicated/silly lyrics often heard. I became a fan shortly after the single for \\"Toxicity\\" (the song) was released, for that and \\"Chop Suey!\\" were the only reasons I needed to purcahse this album. As I'm sure you know, this is an album full of B-Sides, and I won't say \\"Wow! I can't believe this is a B-Side\\" 20 times because you've more than likely seen it before if you've read previous/upcoming reviews. You know these are B-Sides, and we don't need to know how mind-boggled you are about it.<br />Anyway, this is SOAD's weakest effort, only a little worse than their debut, but by no means bad. There's a few boring efforts, but you'll read about that...<br />1. Chic 'N' Stu-3/5-The first track, that can be very hard to like after listening to it a few times. The lyrics are humerous, but after they get old, I haven't foun much reason to continue listening to this (though I still do).<BR>2. Inner Vision-5/5-Definetly the most radio track on eh album, and should definetly be a single (if this album will even have single). It starts off quickly, with a great introduction, and catchy verses.<BR>3. Bubbles-4/5-A good song that I found hard to like at first, but you can get used to (almost) anything. It's extremely short (like many songs off \\"Toxicity\\"), at 1:56, and it simply ends too soon.<BR>4. Boom!-0/5-The first real bad song, that basically consists of Serj talking during the verses and yelling \\"Boom!\\" during the chorus, as well as some other stuff.<BR>5. NuGuns-2/5-Nothing new, and that's why it's only a 2. <BR>6. A.D.D. (AKA \\"American Dream Disorder\\")-5/5-One of the best. Starts off with a strange guitar riff, followed by the usual \\"pounding\\" (as I call it) SOAD intro, then to a catchy verse, and into an awesome chorus. The most standout feature is the lyrics.<BR>7. Mr. Jack-5/5-The longest track on the album, at 4:09. It's great.<BR>8. I-E-A-I-A-I-O-5/5-I love it. Awesome chorus.<BR>9. 36-0/5-I don't like this at all. I don't even think they set out to make it a real song, just sort of an interlude.<BR>10. Pictures-0/5-Another bad song. <BR>11. Highway Song-5/5-It's hard to describe this song. Listen and see.<BR>12. F*ck The System-5/5-The best track by far. I love the noises Serj makes.<BR>13. Ego Brain-2/5-It's not too good. i always skip it.<BR>14. Theatawaves-5/5-AWESOME!<BR>15. Roulette-It's acoustic. SOAD doesn't sound that good acoustic.<BR>16. Streamline-2/5-A bad song to add the album. I didn't like it on the \\"Scorpion King\\" soundtrack either.<br />Get this CD last. It's still great, though.
0151006903|3.0|I have to admit, this is one was a bit of disappointment. I also have to admit that the disappointment probably has more to do with me than the author. As is his wont, Eco projects a lot of the ideas he presented in his various non-fictional work onto a fictional setting. Having read a lot of those works, a good deal of the novel was just regurgitating.<BR>The book is enjoyable, even if some reader might find it difficult to get into. It is humorous, erudite, and full of fun tidbits. Style-wise this is probalby most similar to Eco's &quot;Name of the Rose&quot; -- his best known novel. However, I would still recommend any of his other fictional books over this one. <BR>[More detail below]<BR>Abundant in rich historical detail, Eco returns to some of his favourite themes -- Babel, Historical Hoaxes, Heresies, as well as his native city. The translation was excellent, as usual by William Weaver, but the story itself is by necessity long. I could not really find too many faults with any particular periods of protagonist's life the book covers, but somehow the narration was listless and aimless. Indeed, that could adequately describe many a life, and may have been intended as such, but does not make for the most exciting reading. We start at the end, chronologically, jump to the beginning, and work our way forward to the sacking of Constantinople. Eco seems to enjoy the trappings of each mini-era, of each place and time too much to move along. The overarching theme of Pr. Johannan is presented early, but does not really get going until the 2nd half of the book. As a reader I just did not feel in a hurry either. For whatever reason I could not find myself believing in the relationship between Barbarossa and Baudolino, and so a lot of motivation Baudolino has did not really work for me. It might well go better for you.
B000000JO3|5.0|This is the best CD I have ever heard. Not only is it great music (and it is!) but it has the most powerful message you will ever recieve. Sometimes the message is not obvious, and this means that you don't have to live it to listen to Minor Threat, but it's always there if you're listening for it. None of the watered down, sugar-coated (ahem) \\"punk\\" of today* compares to this. The very fact that young people like me, aged 18, too young to remember this first time round, are still listening to it proves its greatness. This record will live forever.<br />*I am not saying that there is anything wrong with bands like Greenday and Good Charlotte. I actually LIKE Good Charlotte, but they're not PROPER punk are they? Let's be honest.

Horng<BR>                             Per.6<BR>   <BR>     This book is about a young boy who, suprisingly, got the most important and rare job, the Reciever of Memory. At the Ceremony of Twelve, every twleve year old boys and girls get the job of their life. They usually get the job that they wanted the most. Jonas was called on last and was announced the Reciver of Memory. The Receiver's job is to store all of the memory of a person including pain, love, hate, and etc. Jonas's townspeople doesn't have any feelings and their life are always predictable.<BR>     I like this book because it has adventures and the part about a person keeping all of the memory that no one else has. Tht's pretty cool, however, then you'll have to be a loner of some kind because you can't share any of your memory and you can't talk to your parents about it either. The other trouble of being a reciver of Memory is the bad memories that are like nightmares! I wouldn't want to be a Reciver because I want to share my feelings with my family and I can not hide them to myself.   <BR>     My favorite part of the book is when Jonas got his first happy memory. The Reciver all get a set of rules. Guess what, in one of the rules, the Reciver can lie to anybody if he has to, he can even lie to his parents! \\"He had never, within his memory, been tempted to lie.\\" That's what Jonas thought about lying to people. After a few more trainings, Jonas is starting to see colors. The first color that Jonas saw was red. Jonas loved every class going to the House of the Old and getting a new and happy memory, until now....<BR>     That's when the part that I dislike comes up. The memories are not all good, there are always some bad ones. The first bad memory that the Giver gave to Jonas was the pain of sunburn, then the pain of falling down, breaking your leg,and scraping your face against jagged egdes of ice. This is Jonas's feelings when he first got the pain of breaking a leg: \\"He sat, and looked at his own leg, where it lay stright on the bed, unbroken. The brutal slice of pain was gone. But the leg ached horribly, still, and his face felt raw.\\" If you think that's overwhelming, wait until Jonas first got the memory of war. The experience was frightning, people running for their lives, orphans crying over their family member's death, and soldiers dying  at war. Now that's overwhelming for me. Think about it, you even have to carry that memory around you for the rest of your life until you transfer your memory to a new Reciver of Memory.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Peter Parker is the class nerd.  One day, while on a field trip, he is bitten by a super spider and starts to gain super powers.  While he's having fun climbing walls and shooting webbing, his best friend's dad is undergoing a transformation of his own.  Norman Osborn has tried a highly risky experiment on himself, and it's made him crazy.  Transforming into the Green Goblin, he fights to bring down all those who oppose him.  When Spiderman gets in his way, the battle ensues.<br />What really drew me to this movie was the emotions and struggles it puts the characters through.  Peter is forever longing to be noticed by Mary Jane, and his sudden transformation doesn't turn her eye.  Yet he's also aware that keeping who he has become a secret is highly important to the safety of his friends and family.  That last scene was dynamite!  I also enjoyed the Jekyll/Hyde relationship that Norman had with the Green Goblin.  That was filmed and written well, making the villain slightly sympathetic himself.  The actors do a wonderful job of drawing me in and making me care for the characters.  Much like the real world, not everything gets resolved easily, and this movie certainly left me wanting to know more.<br />The DVD set is wonderful as well.  The film is preserved with clear picture and sound.  The commentaries are interesting and there are loads of behind the scenes things to go through.  I'm not that familiar with the Spider-Man comics, so I found the sections on the character especially fascinating.<br />This movie tempers its action with wonderful heart, making it a truly likeable film.  Movies don't get much better then this.
0887306667|3.0|The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing by Al Ries and Jack Trout is a concise listing of marketing tenets. It proves to be a valuable read that, in some cases, is a bit too simplistic.  Even the appearance of the book with crude illustrations and large print, which I assume is intentional, give it a children's-book appearance. Given its size and detail, a fast reader could cover this text in under two hours.<br />While the book is a worthy read for anyone interested in marketing, the simplistic concepts and dichotomous thinking lead to some erroneous conclusions.  In fact, since the book was written in 1993, some of the arguments on specific examples were proven to be incorrect.  Like most marketing books, it somewhat neglects the informed consumer who can make buying decisions based on quality and product features.  At the same time, it overlooks the effect of product superiority on market prominence.<br />One example in the \\"The Law of the Line Extension\\" argued against Microsoft's foray into business graphics, spreadsheet and word processing software because of the market leadership of Harvard Graphics, Lotus and WordPerfect, respectively.  It suggests that trying \\"to be all things to all people, you inevitably wind up in trouble.\\"  Of course, what these arguments fail to acknowledge is that the *product* integration and distribution can a profound effect on market penetration.<br />In some cases, it makes the mistake of many marketing books suggesting that poor marketing and not junk products are the cause for the failure of products such as the Cadillac Allante.  It would be nice if the authors, or any other authors for that matter, could develop a matrix of examples of bad/good marketing for bad/good products.  Perhaps a text such as \\"How to market junk products to unwitting consumers and make money in the process\\" would be useful.<br />Of course, any critic can poke holes in an author's work.  To its credit, the simplicity gives readers a check list to compare against their exiting marketing initiatives.  This text, while being useful, suffers from the same flaw as many marketing books in that it ignores the consumers ability to see through, disregard, and counteract marketing initiatives.  In summary, it is worth reading (for free at the bookstore).  However, I would suggest that it is a bit too basic to serve as a key reference.against their exiting marketing initiatives.

B00005QZ7U|3.0|My wife and watched this after a friend recommended it.  We were in shock - I can't say if that was good or bad.  Most people will love or hate the movie.  The more familiar you are with modern pop music, movies, and musicals in general, the more you will like it.  I didn't recognize half the songs and I'm sure I missed most of the allusions.  One thing I did get, though, is that Ewan McGregor is an amazing talent!
B00000064G|4.0|I have listened to \\"Pink Moon\\" again for the first time in a year. In fact, I let it cycle through three times, feeling compelled to try and grasp the fleeting music before it fades away to silence, for this, at times, the music of quiet. Perhaps it is the vocals, often a hoarse whisper that cannot compete even with the solo acoustic guitar, or perhaps the hollow wisdom of youth trying to lament honestly life's shortcomings. There are moments of unfathomable insight and heartbreak encapsulated here.<br />The title track is a delight, but the interplay of piano and guitar makes me yearn for more instead of less, so that after a few songs with just guitar and vocals my attention drifts. Each flows and melds into the next, never quite forging a separate identity, one extended thought shrouded in neither black nor white but a gray, hazy and vague. Still, the effect for me is much like trying to make a meal from a stash of communion wafers. Each song ushers in a promise of something more, something beyond the pall, but few fully satisfy. (I prefer his other work on \\"Five Leaves Left\\" and \\"Bryter Later.\\")<br />Desolation and isolation may permeate the songs, but Mr. Drake still displayed his mastery of the acoustic guitar with a touch and flair that both keep the whole recording from drowning in melancholy and testify to his considerable talents. Hence, \\"Pink Moon\\" seems as a fitting requiem for Nick Drake.
B00008RH3L|5.0|This is easily one of the Coen brothers finest films and it's long awaited debut on DVD will hopefully punctuate it's greatness. Although it never received it's due in it's day, many covet the film for it's absorbing script, mesmerizing acting and jaw dropping technical beauty. The story revolves around a hard nosed mobster who is sharp, cunning and loyal despite his flaws. It also showcases rich characters you simply never see from the tepid world of major studios. Even if you don't catch all that is happening behind the motivations for the plot and it's characters on the first viewing. The acting by Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harding, John Turturro, John Polito, J.E. Freeman and great Albert Finny will keep your attention glued. Also the technical presence of it's cinematography and sound will startle you now that DVD can properly showcase it. Add on top another gorgeous soundtrack by the underrated Carter Burwell, and it will just astound you that this film never swept the Academy Awards. IT IS THAT GREAT! The DVD won't be stacked with extras but, trust me, this movie is so good you won't need them. This film and a few others by Kubrick and Foreman are the only dramas, I watch over and over. I can't thank Fox enough for releasing this film on DVD!
B000002NFM|1.0|I dont see why there are so many good reveiws. I like electronic music, so I borrowed this from a friend and returned it the very next day. I really tried to give them a chance, but it's just not that good.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I love the Terminator. It is very original and very good. The most important thing in a action adventure movie is the story behind it. The Terminator was the first movie to tell the story on the run. While Reese and Sarah were running from the Terminator, Reese was telling the story about the machines. Arnold was outstanding in this movie. He played The Terminator  perfectly. The DVD of the terminator is great.
0446608955|5.0|Title: A Walk to Remember<BR>By: Nicholas Sparks<BR>Reviewed by: A. Shen<BR>Period: 1<br />A Walk to Remember, by Nicholas Sparks is a story about how a popular guy, Landon Carter falls in love with a quiet girl named Jamie Sullivan. This book takes place in 1958. Landon is an outgoing teen and could careless about his future. Jamie, on the other hand is a shy and responsible girl. Landon's first impression of Jamie was that she was a goody-goody with no life. As he got to know her, he realized that she had more than a soft side and cared about other things than work. Jamie was a serious Christian. Landon, after spending lots of time with Jamie, falls in love with her. Jamie also falls in love with Landon. Soon, Jamie informs Landon that she is sick and is going to die soon. <br />I liked this book a lot because the way it flowed. Everything was so detailed. The story has a moral; don't judge a book by its cover. He did not care about people like Jamie Sullivan. He thought that Jamie was just a shy and quiet girl that was socially unpopular. \\"Who I saw in school was one thing; who I saw after school was completely different, and Jamie had never been on my social calendar.\\" Turns out that she is more than that. <br />A Walk to Remember taught me to respect others and not to be mean to others just because of how they look or what rumors have been going on about that person; to treat others the way I want to be treated. A Walk to Remember can make the tears come out of your eyes. Although I didn't like that Jamie died in the end, it went along with the story. It flowed along and that's what makes A Walk to Remember so touching. You can never let go of this book. Jamie showed Landon that life has more meaning to it than he thought.  \\"Jamie, who was destined to show him the depths of the human heart- and the joy of pain of living\\".<br />My favorite part in A Walk to Remember was when Jamie showed Landon the true meaning of life and when Landon stuck up for Jaime when shewas made fun of by other people. I liked it when Jamie showed Landon what life really meant because before, Landon thought that everything in the world revolved around him and that only him and his friends mattered. Jamie changed that. I also liked the part where Landon stuck up for her because it showed that he actually learned something from Jaime and that he cared about. He didn't care what anybody else thought about him now. My least favorite part in this book was when Jaime pasts away. It didn't kill the story, but it just makes you feel so sad and she just seems like a real person, a person close to you, dead.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Without a doubt, the best of the Stones. Just ahead of Exile. This album is a MUST for any assembalance of a music collection. Gimme Shelter is also perhaps one of the greatest songs ever written. The rest of them will rip ya like no other band outside of the Stones can. Their best. Hands down!

B000002J1B|5.0|Named possibly after one of the best sections from The Tales of Topographic Oceans triumph or tragedy (depending on your viewpoint) RELAYER regained alot of lost ground held by a certain line-up of YES.<br />The reviewer who doesn't see the jazz-fusion elements of this album, I don't know whether to feel sorry for or try and recommend they listen to any of the jazz-fusion albums around at the time (Chick Corea's/Stanley Clarke's Return To Forever, John McLaughlin's/Billy Cobham's Birds of Fire just to name two). Jazz is all over RELAYER like a rug. Though Moraz brought in classical distinctions required by YES at this point, his leanings were far more in the jazz realm than Wakeman has ever ventured. Wakeman is a great classical keyboardist, and not to slight the man at all, because I do like him, he rarely ventures out of that style. Tony Kaye and Patrick Moraz share that distinction of being more R &amp; B, Jazz orientated players, which I think is a welcome addition to the YES way of doing things.<br />First off, this is probably one of my all-time favourite YES albums. It is so different than anything else they produced, it left YES fans wondering what was going on, and the new initiate probably asking why they got involved in the first place. It is cold, discordant, metallic, synthesised, rhythmic, beautiful, grandiose and sublime all in one. It ALMOST makes me wish Bruford had been the drummer on this one, because later on when Bruford played with Moraz on Squire's 1975 solo album, it seemed their playing matched eachother well, and their affinity for jazz continued through to their side projects together. White's drumming on this album by the way is spectacular, especially on Sound Chaser, and much more effective than what was attempted on Tales from Topographic Oceans 'Ritual'.<br />The three songs that comprise Relayer are the strongest YES have produced. And maybe Gates of Delirium is in every way the equivalent of 1972's 20 minute Close To The Edge opus. When YES ventured into the 20 minute realm , many times it worked, but Topographic showed its pitfalls, and when ideas run out, or get dragged on for too long a spell. With time things can be improved upon, but as the record stands as a testament of how the piece was originally presented, Topographic did not show as effectively what Gates of Delirium did. Wakeman's disinterest in Topographic does not help.<br />The Gates of Delirium has one of my favourite pieces of music by anyone in its many sections. It happens after the war section and the chaos has ensued. The combined slide guitar and keyboard melody just happens to be a moment I look forward to everytime I play this song. It then disappears into one of the most somber moments in music. This 3 or 4 minutes of music in a 20 minute piece ranks as one of the best things anyone has ever done with music to my ears. Without the preceding sections and finale, it wouldn't work as well. What this section is called I couldn't tell you, or where it exactly begins and ends, but the synthesiser and slide guitar duplicate the same melody, Moraz playing it first, and then Howe plays it with more intensity, till it just cascades away. Those few minutes to me define what YES is about. Thats when they are really really brilliant.<br />Parts of Delirium do tread that jazz-funk line, especially in Squire's playing, and the polyrhythms and off-time interplay with him and White. Delirium treads that line between Yes classical and Yes jazz, and that would have been a great direction to go --- (Squire continued this with Lucky Seven on his solo album the next year to great affect). But Wakeman's return in 1977 stopped YES from experimenting and brought it back to that classical inflected YES that won its original fans. Relayer for me represents YES moving forward.<br />Sound Chaser and To Be Over are equally as powerful as pieces of music. I simply cannot get enough or say enough about this album overall. It may bore some music listener's, but YES's Relayer is a very bright moment in this band's career, and definitely worth the listening.stener's, but YES's Relayer is a very bright moment in this band's career, and definitely worth the listening.
B00005MP58|5.0|My all time favorite book has become my all-time favorite DVD. This is a very faithful adaption to Jane Austin's novel. Yes, a few scenes were added, but they only add to the appeal of the story. This is not like the Laurence Olivier version, that totally changes the story. They are minor scenes that add a little color or additional info that can readily be imagined as having been true. <br />The acting is first rate, and the casting was excellent, so that each and every character comes alive.
B000002J23|4.0|Why is it with a band called YES, so many of their hardcore fans say NO?<br />Tell any YES purist that DRAMA is one of the best albums they issued, and you'll get slammed back with it doesn't have Anderson or Wakeman on it , so NO! I wholeheartedly disagree with the purist and stand by my support for this album, and recommend it to anyone who is unfamiliar with YES's music. ALL of Yes's music.<br />Of all the YES albums released, this one stands out for one main reason. I'm not saying its their best, but it has one outstanding quality that others lack. Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White play together as a unit. DRAMA boasts the most group unity YES has possessed in any line-up. The preceding albums, TORMATO and GOING FOR THE ONE lacked focus, and it's apparent that different ideas of what YES music was about prevailed. Anderson started bringing YES down a Renaissance, fairy land, whimsical path, that by 1978, was well out of step with the way music was going. It seemed Wakeman supported those steps. The extended pieces YES were known for lacked edge and group dynamic so in the forefront of their 'classic' albums Fragile and Close To The Edge. They sounded uninspired, and about to be sucked down by the times. Always in the background were Squire & White's rhythm support during these diverging courses, and Howe played extended solos. YES music became as formulaic as AOR radio in that one could expect a 15 minute + piece of music, with a 12 minute Howe solo within (exaggeration only used for example), Anderson's cosmic meanderings about something he only knows about, and Wakeman's steady use of the Birotron. One of the most annoying instruments ever invented.<br />When Anderson & Wakeman left, Howe, Squire & White decided to continue on, much to the discontent of fans and Anderson & Wakeman themselves. (Howe felt the same when YES continued on without him, even though he pursued his own commercial route with ASIA). Squire enlisted the services of ex-Buggles Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes because he felt they could contribute to YES. And they did. DRAMA shows a tighter group overall. As said before, on no other YES album (with Howe) will you find such a unified effort to present YES music. Howe, Squire & White drop the expected things that are expected of them as personalities, and play like a band together. Sacrificed are the solos, the dramatic arrangements, for the heavier, tighter band sound. DRAMA presents a lean, meaner YES sound, and a definite precursor to ASIA's success story of taking elements of progressive rock, honing it down and cutting out the flourishes, and making it accessible to the person who may not like progressive rock. Thats what music should be about, it should serve as an introduction to another type of music, not a barrier.<br />6 songs on the DRAMA album, and all are top class. They rate among my favourites of the YES repertoire, and was glad to hear parts of Tempus Fugit played during the Rabin-era years in concert. It seems the current YES is going out of its way to erase part of its history, and glorify what it feels best represents what YES is about. Which is nice and all, but you can't stay in 1972 and 1973 forever can you? It seems the purists have won this one, and YES has stopped progressing, found its target audience and is satisfied to stay there. And its a shame really, because their biggest leaps forward have been when they've replaced a key member of the band, ie Howe, Anderson or Wakeman. It seems one or all three of these individuals keeps YES music from being as experimentative as it could be. As far as in composition and arrangement, the 'classic' YES line-up (Howe/Bruford or White/Wakeman/Squire/Anderson) has alot to be proud of, and a majority of the classic works are beautiful, creative, orchestral, grandiose, majestic, a ton of other things. But it fizzles quickly over successive albums. They're only human, and to keep up that level of music is hard. I think Tales From Topographic Oceans wiped them out, but the follow up RELAYER (1974) without Wakeman, and with Patrick Moraz replacing him injected new life into the band and got them to experiment with jazz and funk. It changed YES's mode of expression, utilising more of the music that exists outside of their realm. Its refreshing and stops things from becoming stale and trapped in time or an era. Same thing with DRAMA. Same thing with Rabin-era YES. It keeps the music changing and incorporating new elements, new styles, new ways of doing things, which is what music is about. Keeping it alive.<br />Buy DRAMA if you're scared of prog rock, or Jon Anderson, or 20 minute songs. Its a good introduction and one of the best albums this band has put out. Hopefully it will introduce you to what this band has done previously and afterward.aphic Oceans wiped them out, but the follow up RELAYER (1974) without Wakeman, and with Patrick Moraz replacing him injected new life into the band and got them to experiment with jazz and funk.

0380789019|5.0|Such a dark fantasy, complete with killer angels, life-sucking velvets (don't ask), urban-legend \\"crocodiles in the sewers\\" monsters, and lycantropic assasins, wouldn't usually be my thing. In addition, Gaiman's often-graphic descriptions of the London Below and its grimy inhabitants are enough to turn one's stomach. Still, the book kept me absolutely hooked while I wolfed it down. <br />Basically, the premise of the story is that there is a London Above and London Below. And that ostensibly, there is Paris Above, Moscow Above, New York Above, and then, there are their \\"below\\" counterparts. And if you ever cross into the \\"below,\\" you can say bye-bye to your normal life. You become... well, not exactly invisible, but so utterly insignificant in your world, so absolutely forgettable, that your family will soon forget you've ever existed... and then, you'll have no options but to go back to the London Below. And you don't want to do that. It's ugly. It's dirty. It's wet. There are horrid creatures of all sorts, including two assassins that are strange man-beasts, one a fox, one a wolf, and that have burned Troy, tortured a medieval convent-ful of nuns to painful death and killed two \\"accredited gods.\\" And somewhere, there is the Beast, which reminded me of the horrid creature in Le Pacte de Loup, but was, basically, a slightly glorified urban legend. I mean, haven't you heard about them alligators in the sewers? The book actually states, at one point, the various monsters under different cities. The London Below, according to a woman-bravo (a bodyguard) named Hunter, has an overgrown (hey, it's been feeding on sewage since 17th century), mean, nasty... but you'll know when you get there. <br />This is the world into which a perfectly normal, rational, boring man by the name of Richard Mayhew is catapulted when he helps a girl bleeding on the sidewalk. The girl's name is Door (yes, like the one you open--don't ask). By the end of the book, the incongruity of that name will have long stopped bothering you... <br />The book is fascinating, not only for the story itself, which is old in some respects (after all, Gaiman is not the first to suggest the idea of a parallel world) and novel in other, but also, in the clever language, dark (sometimes midnight-dark) humor and excellent literary references. For instance, the big, black scoundrel of a guide that the main characters, Richard and Door, use for navigation around the London Below, is named Marquis de Carabas. Everything about him is oddly reminiscent of a cat, bringing to mind Mikhail Bulgakov's odd black talking cat Behemoth from the great Master & Margarita. Well! It took me a day or so to realize that Marquis de Carabas was actually the name the clever Puss-in-the-Boots from the old Pierrot fairy-tale picked for his poor master. There are subtle references to Milton (getting them will make you feel cool about yourself, and not getting them will not spoil your enjoyment of the book) and not-so-subtle ones to the Wizard of Oz (you'll definitely get those!).<br />The book will prove particularly interesting to anyone familiar with London and especially, the London uneground. Gaiman's wild imagination enlivens the names of the old Tube stations: there is an Earl in Earl's Court (an actual decrepit old man, who has his own court, complete with a court fool; his whole entourage is feeding on Cadbury bars and Coca-Cola out of the station vending machines), a Raven in Ravenscourt, the Knightsbridge is actually Night's Bridge--a Bridge covered with eternal, threatening, dangerous darkness. And Angel Islington is an angel named Islington. :) And the Floating Market is held at Harrod's. :) <br />I highly recommend this to anyone with the taste for an unusual adventure, dark humour, and spell-binding story.

IF you love the music i \\"STRONGLY\\" encourage you to see them live. Nothing...NOTHING...is better than seeing them live.  Sure its nice to listen to them on CD but man, they are truly a media driven band,  Showing Subliminal imagery on the wall while they perform....3 mins into \\"Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven\\" i almost started crying because its just that much more beautiful...

0385493622|5.0|I was in college, back in 1994, when a professor came into the classroom very excited. He had a PhD in mathematics, and told us that it probably would not mean much for us, but he had just heard that Fermat's Last Theorem had been solved, after more than three centuries, and told us about a theorem and the phrase: &quot;I have a proof which this margin is too narrow to contain&quot;, and the long search for that lost proof. <br />Almost ten years later, I found this book. It's great. It's written in the same style as &quot;The Code Book&quot;, and now I understand the excitement that professor showed.<br />Going from the Greeks to the proof of the Theorem, the book provides facts and anecdotes that really make the reader care for mathematicians and their fates, as explained in it. It also mentions other related themes, like the Great Library in Alexandria, and the understanding of physics from the nineteenth century to the present. I vividly imagined how the tension in the room must have felt when the proof was presented.<br />Mathematical contents are contained in appendixes, and they include a couple of interesting problems. However, I think junior high school mathematics are required in order to solve the problems, and no mathematical background is needed at all to enjoy the book.

B00004X0Q0|5.0|At The Drive-In had the rare quality to both rock out like bands like MC5, and Nirvana, but be just as effective as a band like Radiohead, or the Smashing Pumpkins. ATDI was very energetic and manic, particularly the vocal attack of Cedric, but had a knack for writing hooks and emotional riffs. The lyrics also are abstract, and they unveil their profound meaning with every listen, and you hear/experience something new every time you put it in. It deserved to be huge... REALLY huge, and they were just winning the mainstream over with their addictive and powerful single &quot;One Armed Scissor&quot; when they broke up (or went on their 'indefinite hiatus'). If ATDI never reforms for whatever reason, they ended on an incredible high with Relationship of Command.
B00004Y9PP|2.0|Pitch Black is highly overrated. Everyone says it's good but I think it's just boring. The action doesn't kick in for at least an hour and when it starts to get interesting it's suddenly the end of the film. I'm sorry but I cant stand this film.
0684803356|5.0|First off, I am not a literature expert and do not claim to know all the finer details present in this book.  What I do know is that as an engineer, I enjoy reading, especially classics, and this book has given me confidence in Hemingway as one of the best authors in American literature.<br />My first and only experience with Hemingway before was &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; in high school. Part of the problem may have been in high school, but I was honestly not impressed.  However, since that time I watched the movie &quot;In Love and War&quot;, I have found Hemingway more interesting, but still didn't have time to read him until I found &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;.  I think this book is just fantastic. The detail that goes into this narrative makes the book hard to put down and very full of meaning.<br />The conflict that the hero, Robert Jordan, goes through internally, externally, and mentally form the basis of what has to be one of the best character studies I've seen in a novel.  I also find the historical perspective quite fascinating as a person who enjoys history and culture.  The Spanish Civil War is something that is overlooked in our education, and I find that even the fictional account here gives insight into the larger issues faced, even if the story is focused on the inner conflict of the main character.<br />This book really shows the inferiority of modern novels and will definitely drive me to continue to read Hemingway.  The only question is what next.  I can't imagine anything being better than &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;.  My only complaint is in the style of the ending.  While it serves an interesting purpose, I don't feel it quite lives up to the quality of the rest of the book, but the concept is fantastic.

With even more brilliant special effects and an even deadlier Terminator than the last, you simply have to see this film. Fans of the original will totally adore this film. Even if you did not like the first, check this one out - it,s amazingly brilliant!!!

B00008AY3L|4.0|Hats Off to Ben Harper!<BR>I was not a fan before this album, because I felt he had not yet proven deserving of the accolades he has recieved thus far in his career (Read: Overated).  Like Springsteen and Dylan, it took 3 or 4 solid albums under his belt to come up with a true classic.  This is a unified album with a spiritual vibe throughout, and only strays ever so slightly from the timelessness of albums such as &quot;What's Goin On&quot; &amp; &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;.  Like Neil Young albums from his 70s heyday, this album feels like an old friend from the first listen, yet Harper's wide range of talents alllows for a greater variety of styles to please a modern music lover's eclectic tastes.  With so many good songs to please both the fellas and the ladies, I'd say you'd have to go back yo Lenny Kravitz's &quot;Mama Said&quot; to find an album of such universal appeal and which rewards repeated listening. The only reason this album did not get 5 stars is because I know Ben has better up his sleeve!  I'm still looking forward to Ben's first wholly original album, as the shadow of his musical influences (Marley, Marvin, Zeppelin, etc.)pervade this album and almost overshadow his unique talents. His heroes would be proud though.
0062502182|5.0|Paulo Coelho like an alchemist have found the right ingridents to tell a story that is a masterpiece.  An exotic journey of a boy which started as a dream but finished in a manner which was fulfilling for the shepherd boy and the readers as well.
0316666343|5.0|Wow. Thats what I thought when I was reading this book and when I finished it. What an original tale, what an amazing writer. To tackle something like rape and murder from the viewpoint of the 14-year-old victim and make it work. Not only work, but soar. <br />Weve all probably read stories about a family trying to pull things back together after the loss of one of its own. But weve never heard it from the deads perspective. And what a perspective! Susie Salmon, the deceased in question, hovers over her remaining parents and siblings and watches as they come to grips (or fail to) with her violent demise. A poignant, heart-wrenching situation is made more so by being told from Susies perspective. We feel her loneliness and alienation just as acutely as we feel that of her familys. This book seems to cover the specter of human emotions. It says so much about sudden loss, about going on with your life and about the importance of family. It is simultaneously spiritual and grounded in reality. <br />Having said all this, the only part that really didnt work for me was when Susies soul briefly comes back to earth by inhabiting the body of a friend for the purpose of making love with her junior high school boyfriend. This was a tad implausible and unnecessary. Overall, though, the book worked. And it wasnt as depressing as you might imagine. In fact, its almost hopeful.
0451527046|5.0|Jim Hawkins, a young boy, helps to run a family inn and falls into trouble left and right.  When Billy Bones, an old buccaneer that lived in the inn, dies and leaves his large chest for claim, Jim snatches the key from his neck and opens his chest.  He finds an oilskin package that contained a map to buried treasure and embarks on a journey to recover it.  He and some of his companions go to Bristol, set up a crew, and board the great Hispaniola and depart for the island.  One of the crewmembers they acquired while in Bristol was the famous pirate, Long John Silver.  While on the journey, Jim overhears a conversation between Long John and three other members in which the men prepared plans of mutiny and determined how they would carry them out.  They reach the island and the crew begins their corruption.  Jim and his companions fight many conflicts while on the island.  They are low on supplies, outnumbered, injured, and tired.  Jim set out to retrieve the Hispaniola and completes his objective successfully.  When he returns to the old stockade, he has a surprise waiting for him.
B00004U8H4|5.0|American Psycho may well be one of the most misunderstood films in recent history. First off, this film is a comedy, albeit a very dark one; second, the violence takes place offscreen, allowing the symbolism of the film to take center stage.<br />The film is not so much about the excess of the 1980s, as it is the emptiness of the sheer pursuit of all things superficial. The central character, Patrick Batemen (played by the brilliant Christian Bale), epitomizes emptiness, something he himself knows. He comments early on that while he may seem to be as human as everyone else, there is merely \\"an idea of a Patrick Bateman,\\" and in truth, he just \\"isn't there.\\"<br />The film follows Bateman's odyssey through what appears to be a violent killing spree, motivated, it seems, sheerly by the desire for sensation.  Whether the violence is actually happening, or merely a metaphor, the lingering question gives the film its depth. It's hard to imagine an actor more perfect for this role than Christian Bale, who finally got a chance to show off his chops in AP. It's equally hard to believe Bale is actually British, as his accent is so flawlessly perfect. (He's also quite easy on the eyes, which certainly doesn't hurt.)<br />American Psycho is one of those films you can watch over and over, and continually see new things. Every frame seems to have been carefully designed, and the visuals are stunning. Bateman's apartment, for example, is all white, startlingly sterile, and shows no sign of personality or individuality whatsover. The apartment, like many other images in the film, speaks volumes.<br />Ambiguity about gender, sexual preference, reality, meaning, and nearly everything is clearly deliberate. Does anything mean *anything*? Is life inherently meaningless? Can external beauty disguise internal ugliness? Does it? Should it?<br />American Psycho, in any format, is a ride and a half. It's entertaining, hilariously and frighteningly funny, and powerfully thought-provoking. Ibelieve American Psycho is one of the greatest films of the latter half of the 20th century, and will be considered so, if only in retrospect. See it expecting greatness, and, guaranteed, you'll find it.
6305181772|3.0|The idea of bringing the television series Mission Impossible to the big screen seemed at once to be one a long time in finally coming and one to be viewed with some trepidation by those fans loyal to the millieu of the series.<br />Mission Impossible does not disappoint with its action, but its plotline stands rather simply as a betrayal and vengeance formula, and worse, one rather implausible to the legions of fans of the television series.  Without giving away too much of the plot, a most trusted member of the Impossible Mission Force betrays his team and country for ... money.  Though the nature of the betrayer makes for a much greater indignity at his crime, it leaves fans of the series feeling as if the film simply lops off its head to begin anew, discarding the roots that made the movie itself possible.<br />Tom Cruise still delivers an excellent performance as a slick and capable member of the IMF, and fans of action films will certainly enjoy this picture.  However, if you feel more than an inkling of loyalty to the series, perhaps you should skip to the second film, which in the end has much more the feel of Mission Impossible than does this movie.
B00007BHOE|5.0|this dvd is great, it last almost 2 hours . great quality,great sound everything a slpknot fan would want.
B0000399WI|5.0|One of the best screen adaptations of Stephen King's work to date, The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most powerful stories told by the grand master of horror, yet not a single ghost or gorey monster appears.  Instead, the story is a character film about a wrongfully-imprisoned man and his struggles with a life destined to be served out in prison.<br />People obviously more wicked than he escape punishment, from the scheming warden to an overbearing top guard, while Tim Robbins' character must silently endure their evils as one who has already been convicted and sentenced as a wrongdoer; the juxtaposition of the imprisoned good men verses the evil ones looking after them makes for a story that draws in the audience and gives them easy identification with the main characters.<br />Somehow this wonderful film slipped by me in theaters; don't let it pass you by on DVD as well.
0671015206|3.0|I did not feel that reading this book was a waste of my time, because it was a fast read and had caught my attention several times. I do feel that by reading this book I am walking away with something I had not thought about before. The reason why I am giving this book only 3 stars is because I often felt that it was repetative. There were chapters in this book that appeared identical and I could not tell the difference between them. Overall I would recommend this book as a fast read to anyone who has a few extra hours on their hands.
B00003Q43A|2.0|Independence Day is indeed a great thrill ride, offering at-the-time incredible special effects as aliens invade the Earth bent, as usual, on conquest and destruction.  The movie offers a number of great battle scenes between the heroes and the seemingly-unstoppable aliens with a War of the Worlds-inspired twist toward the end, but beyond those thrills the movie simply falls flat.<br />None of the characters are either acted particularly well or particularly interesting in and of themselves, and many seem inserted simply as a plot device rather than forwarding the overall story.  The aliens receive no characterization whatsoever and do not shine as bad guys, for all they are there for is to attack and destroy with no real explanation of their motivations.<br />For the nit-pickers out there, the movie is chock full of groaners, from using a Mac laptop to \\"interface\\" with alien computer and upload a virus (hah hah, a computer virus rather than a cold virus to kill the aliens) to Area 51 silliness and beyond.<br />Perhaps the worst aspect of the film is that it inspired the summer blockbuster craze of bad effects-laden films from Godzilla to Armageddon to Wild Wild West by giving producers the idea that a film doesn't need a good story or acting so long as it has lots of effects and one-liners.<br />I cannot deny having enjoyed the film in theaters and do own a copy, but it is not something I put in when wanting to watch memorable film.  If you haven't seen it or are looking for a shallow, quick thrill, it's worth a watching, but I won't recommend it otherwise.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I have had this cd for some time now. And this is the first time that i actually get to speak on it. It is classic Sade. This is the very best of her silky, smooth music. Like one reviewer stated this is not car music. Her music is the kind to listen to when you are trying to chill out with your loved one or that special someone. So silky smooth. There is and never will be another artist like Sade. I love her music and hopefully she will continue to make good music. Without a doubt 5 stars......
B00005JKJA|5.0|All I can say is, if you liked Lost Highway, you will love this movie.  Very similar in style and presentation, Mulholland Dr. accomplished the same effect on me that Lost Highway, Fear and Loathing, and Brain Candy all did.  They set you up early on where you think you have your bearings and them rip them out from under you.  It is definitely not for everyone, but some will love it.  Unfortunately, Robert Loggia does not make an appearance in it.
B000002H38|5.0|For anybody who knows me from back in the days to the present knows that I LOVE ANITA BAKER. She set the standard for R&amp;B/Jazz music. This is her best work only because her songs on this lp relax you so much you can go to sleep on them. And then on top of that dance so smooth to it. I can remember when I was having a bad day I'd come home put this tape in and just relax. This lp has that effect on you. So for those who don't know about this cd need to buy or borrow it because this is R&amp;B music at its best.
B000069AUI|5.0|I haven't been in this world for a long time (i'm 17) and i like oldies like pink floyd and Santana but Coldplay is just another story.. since i heard the first chords of Yellow i became a &quot;coldplayholic&quot;. I listen to AROBTTH every night before i go to sleep cause it just soothes me and makes me forget about everything else. If you just broke up with your girlfriend listen to The Scientist or A Warning Sign and you'll feel better. Music doesn't get more emotional and touching than this.
B000006IUQ|5.0|I cannot recommend this movie enough.  It is one of the best screen plays I have ever seen (David Mamet), beautifully shot, superb score, brilliant direction, etc.  It is so laden with irony and truth, humor, terror, it is really inspiring to watch.  The performances are all also very truthful and gritty.  Hopkins and Baldwin do some of their best work in this.  For Baldwin probably his best, along with Hunt for Red October.  I have seen this movie perhaps 15 times since it came out, and it still resonates for me.  I know, I'm gushing, but see it and you'll know what I mean.
B00003ZKS1|5.0|This album is one of the best metal albums of all time cause it goes to show you what rock 'n' roll is really about and Michael Schenker is one of rock's most respected guitar players in history, having previously played with Scorpions (along with Michael's older brother Rudolf) and the British metal outfit UFO, after leaving UFO, he rejoined the Scorpions for the Lovedrive album and left afterwards and he even auditioned for Aerosmith to replace Joe Perry, for which Aerosmith broke up over a glass of spilt milk.<BR>Then he recorded his solo debut album and boy this album rocks, it's a must have by any classic metal, every track on this album are truly unforgettable, the album begins with the fast paced rocker with Armed and Ready, and the epic Cry For the Nations which has a beautiful intro before it turns into an explosion of bone crunching rock, Victim of Illusion is another rocker in the same vein of the previous track, Bijou Pleasurette is a beautiful soft instrumental and Feels Like a Good Thing is a mid-tempo rocker, Into the Arena is the album's other instrumental but this one is a fast paced rocker, Looking Out For Nowhere is another mid-tempo rocker, Tales of Mystery is perhaps the least known track on this album but it's another good song if a little short, Lost Horizons is a 7 minute plus epic which is another classic off of this album, if you love UFO, Deep Purple, Rainbow, Whitesnake and Scorpions, then you gotta own this album but get it while you can cause it's pretty hard to find and it is one of metal's most under appreciated albums of all time.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane is rightfully regarded as one of the great films in the history of the cinema, if not the greatest.  Orson Welles, the boy wonder of the New York stage, made the greatest screen debut ever in directing and starring in this amazing film.  Although some critics have tried to minimize Welless contribution to the film by pointing out that the movie as filmed by Welles was enormously faithful to the brilliant original screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz.  No doubt the original script played a major role in the success of the film, though it should also be pointed out that the film was graced by major talents at every point.  The score was by Bernard Hermann, considered by many to be the greatest composer for cinema (Pyscho, North by Northwest,  and Taxi Driver were just three of his other films), while cinematographer Gregg Toland even before Citizen Kane had already established himself as one of the masters of his discipline, and Robert Wise was a celebrated editor before embarking on a highly successful career as a director.  But despite all the talent, Welles managed to outshine them all, and make his mark on this film as few individuals ever have.  Although utterly inexperienced in cinema, Welles managed one visually brilliant moment after another.  Having a cinematographer of the quality of Toland helped enormously, in that he could help Welles translate his vision into film.  The scene where adults decide the future of a young Kane whose playing in the snow is framed by a window in the background is a brilliant but impossible shot, but it packs a visual wallop.  Or the scene in which Kane and other characters are filmed from below ground level, with the camera being place in a hole in the floor shows that even in his first film Welles was trying to go beyond his predecessors.<br />Welles was not the only cinematic neophyte working on the film.  Many of the key performers in the cast had not worked in film before, but had been members of Welless Mercury Theater.  The cast is impeccable, and because so many went on to long careers in cinema and TV it is hard to remember that at the time they were virtually all unknowns.<br />Yet, despite all its greatness, Citizen Kane is in the end an emotionally unengaging film.  The viewer never gets close to Charles Foster Kane, and while our hearts go out to the little boy who is separated from his Rosebud, they dont linger with him.  Not just Kane, but all of the characters feel remote from the viewer.  Kane strikes us, in the end, more as victimizer than victim, and one feels that whatever bad things have happened to him were more a result of his actions than anything that was done to him.  In the end, I find Citizen Kane easier to admire and respect than to love and cherish.  The greatest film of all time?  Possibly.  The most moving?  By no means.<br />My favorite moment in the film contains perhaps my favorite line in all cinema.  Mr. Bernstein, played by Everett Sloane, is reminded by a reporter that in the early days of Kanes career they made a lot of money, to which he replies, Yes, we made a lot of money.  But theres no trick to making a lot of money, if all you want to do it make a lot of money.ercury Theater.

6305633177|4.0|Yes this DVD was dedicated to the memory of Cliff Burton, but it's also a tribute to old-school Metallica.  Ah... the good old days.  When it was all about the music.  This DVD is excellent.  Some people complain about poor quality, both visual and audio, but if you consider how old the footage is (and bootlegs nontheless), you'll be amazed at the quality.  After reading other reviews I expected something pretty bad.  Man, was I amazed!<BR>Yes, maybe this is not the ideal DVD to turn someone who has never heard of Metallica, but the bottom line is that if you're a true fan, you will not be dissappointed with buying this.  Trust me, I'm not regretting buying this!
B00001ZT6Z|2.0|When bands exist for 30+ years and have 20+ albums to show for it, there are bound to be peaks and valleys.  This album is more like a crater.<BR>One has to take into account the musical climate in the late 80's.  Metal bands were deeply divided - on one side were the Poison/Bon Jovi cheese-metal bands, on the other were the Slayer/Metallica speed/thrash metal bands.  Sabbath certainly didn't fit into either of these categories.  It sounds like they were trying to appease pop-metal fans - which didn't work - and succeeded in further alienating their gloom n' doom fanbase.<BR>Also it must be considered that by this time, only one original member of Black Sabbath (Tony Iommi, guitar) remained.  Joining him are ex-Deep Purple drummer Cozy Powell, Whitesnake bassist Neil Murray, keyboardist Geoff Nicholls, and...<BR>Tony Martin.<BR>Give the guy a break.  He had pretty big shoes to fill, and didn't quite take to Sabbath as quickly as Dio (who gelled with the band immediately) did.  His operatic vocal style and \\"Boo! Scared ya!\\" lyrics at times border on parody.  For example, Black Moon gets off to a pretty good start, but the groans begin with the first line: \\"Oh the devil...\\"  It's a very ham-fisted lyrical approach, and his attempt to create demonic imagery doesn't work.<BR>The mix doesn't help their case much.  This is definitely Sabbath's most keyboard-heavy album.  In fact, the title track's verse is driven almost entirely by keyboards, and not the deep \\"Who Are You\\" type like on Volume 4.  The keyboards are airy for the most part, and while some cool noises are made (Gates of Hell, the beginning of When Death Calls, the bridge of Call of the Wild), it succeeds mainly in neutering the guitar.  Iommi's riffs are still there, but they're not quite as interesting as on previous albums.  His solos are good as always, and he even ventures into two-handed tapping during Devil and Daughter.  Cozy Powell's drum-playing is actually the highlight of the album, except for thefact that they're recorded poorly and have way too much reverb on them which takes away much of their punch.  Neil Murray doesn't do anything all that interesting on bass for this one.<BR>Headless Cross isn't without some highlights.  There's a neat little Eastern-sounding riff in Kill in the Spirit World, but then the keyboards come in and kill it.  The beginning of When Death Calls harkens back to the song Born Again in tone, before shifting up-tempo to mediocre-metalville.  Cloak and Dagger has a bit of pole-dancing sleaze before being ruined (like most of the songs) by an epic, overblown chorus.  The bad outweighs the good.<BR>Brian May appears on the song Nightwing, which has some pretty nice Spanish sounding classical guitar work.  Other than that, when an album's brevity (about 45 minutes long) is one of its highlights, that generally means you should steer clear.
B00006CXSS|5.0|\\"Saving Private Ryan\\" is based on the story of paratrooper Fritz Niland of Easy Company, 506th PIR, 101st Airborne. Private James Ryan is Fritz Niland. However, Spielberg/Hanks make no mention of Fritz Niland in \\"Band of Brothers\\", perhaps to prevent contradiction of their 1998 movie. According to Stephen Ambrose, Niland was fighting in the battle outside of Carentan, Normandy (Episode 3) when he was removed from the front line and sent home. The final bridge defense scene in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" is fiction. Fritz Niland was saved at Carentan.<br />Viewing \\"Band of Brothers\\" is a life-changing experience. These troopers truly are the \\"Greatest Generation\\". I am deeply impressed by Dick Winters and Bill Guarnere. They are heroes in every sense. There has been talk of upgrading Winter's \\"Distinguished Service Cross\\" to \\"Congressional Medal of Honor\\" for his actions at BreCourt Manor (Episode 2). Even if this upgrade never happens, Winters has succeeded in winning the highest respect of each and every viewer of \\"Band of Brothers\\". Bravo!!

Seeing them in Boston, I didn't know whether I should pull-off a punk-styled Lord of the Dance or join the mosh pit.  For those who like Dropkick Murphys but are looking for something a little less &quot;hard&quot;, the fiddle and the fun drinking tunes of Flogging Molly are for you.  You also wouldn't expect such fun, rowdy music to be coupled with such awesome lyrics, but they are.  Flogging Molly has it all.

The box set included the pilot episode, which I know is not included in the set that everyone seems to be talking about here on Amazon.

0375410341|5.0|This book will take you some time to read, but that time is necessary for you to understand the point of the novel.  Time and space have no relation to reality, human relationships go under the microscope, and you are utterly sucked in.  This novel changes the face of the novel as we know it and lets the artist and the author come together as one.  You will examine this book again and again, come to some startling conclusions, read it once again, and find yourself nearer to the truth, whatever it may be.<BR>When I was introduced to this novel, by word of mouth, I was given no more information other than reaction.

B000089RVX|5.0|I'm sure most of you here have heard Evanescence from their two tracks on the DareDevil OST, most likely &quot;Bring Me to Life.&quot; First time I heard that song, I thought it was Linkin Park with an amazing guest vocalist. Woops, guess not. And if you're looking for more Linkin Park- type songs, skedattle. They're not here.<br />BMTL is a pretty bad misrepresentation of Evanescence. Don't get me wrong, I like the song, but there's no more rap-rock to be found. Sure, plenty of nu-metal riffs, but what can you do. The cd kicks off with &quot;Going Under,&quot; a more Industrial song than most. The vocals, both background and lead, are pretty kick. Great song to lead out with, and I've heard it's the next single. You all know BMTL, no need to elaborate. &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; starts out with some acoustic guitar, then jumps right into the blasting guitars. I really dig this song, although there's nothing other than a great chorus and a choir during the bridge that's sticking in my mind to write down here. <br />&quot;My Immortal&quot; is the other track you might have heard from the DD OST. This version seems a tiny bit different, with even more strings, which sometimes sort of drown out Amy. But the song is still gorgeous, one of my favorites on the disk. &quot;Haunted&quot; has layered vocals in the first verse which give it a kind of creepy feel, then the drums start pounding. The last chorus with the choir is pretty cool. Not my favorite song, but still good.<br />Ah, &quot;Tourniquet.&quot; This song rips it up. Scorching guitar, and some of the best vocals (and effects) on the album. Man, Amy goes pretty nuts on this one, I love it. &quot;Imaginary&quot; has quite a bit of piano in it. It's one of the denser songs, if you know what I mean. There's just a wall of guitar, and the piano, and everything else. It took a couple of spins to grow on me, but now I really like it. <br />&quot;Taking Over Me&quot; sounds like your average hard rock song, except ofcourse for the fact that Amy Lee sings it, and everything she touches turns to gold. If this was a guy singing, it'd be a hit at rock radio, but I severly doubt it'll be released. &quot;Hello&quot; is another piano ballad for Amy, and I like this one a lot too. What I said for &quot;Taking Over Me&quot;? Yeah, same for &quot;My Last Breath,&quot; but I think I like this one a little bit better. It works better with Amy's voice, as well. More almost grunge-like, save the intro. &quot;Whisper&quot; is a great tune, with a freaky outro. <br />Overall, this is a great disk for any rock fan, or anyone who likes strong female vocals. Like both? You're in for quite a treat.
B00003CX5P|5.0|i believe some people expected star wars episode one to be as good or equal to episode four.  this is like expecting the follow up to nirvana's nevermind to be as good as nevermind or pearl jam to repeat ten on the sophomore outing.  it is almost impossible to duplicate that kind of quality art.  george lucas had twenty years before he did the &quot;post star wars&quot; movies which turned out to be prequels to the orignal 3 (episonde iv-vi)<BR>    i liked this movie.  liam neeson was great as the jedi, qui-gon jinn and has become one of my favorite star wars characters.  <BR>it was funny to see a young obi wan and i thought ewan mcgreggor was quite good as well.  I loved queen amidala and have always loved natalie portman.  she was amazing as with the rest of  the cast.  the actng was great, i loved the story, the effects and the whole kit and kaboodle.  <BR>     the story begins with the invasion of the planet naboo where we meet queen amadala.  along the course of the movie we pick up jar jar binks played by ahmed best.  he plays the comic relief role for the movie.  some people (myself included) find him annoying.  others liked him.  <BR>    in any event, the movie rolls on and we pick up anakin skywalker who is to become darth vader down the road.  i thought the special effects were amazing.  i love this movie.  i am a sci-fi fan and a star wars fan.  some did not like this movie and i can see why.  it does have flaws but do not forget what future lies ahead and this trilogy has to build the future.  the groundwork has to be laid for quite a number of subjects over the course of three movies.  it is alot.  <BR>     the dvd is packed with stuff and i mean PACKED.  behind the scenes on virtually every aspect of the making of this movie as well as all aspects of the movie itself.  there are approximately six hours of features to plow through so you better have time on your hands.  <BR>     this dvd is so packed that i think, as a consumer, you really do not lose.for fans of sci fi or fans of star wars, this is a winner.  just remember this is NOT like episodes iv-vi.  it is its own entity.
B000089RVX|5.0|First,I want to excuse myself for the fallowing,cause Im German and, for the moment, Im pretty drunk!<BR>After watching `Daredevil I searched the same day, who made the fantastic songs `My immortal and `Bring me to life. -<BR>I have to admit,that I first tried to download the songs via a peer-to-peer network. But when I just found fakes, I even ordered the CD from amazon.com (If youre from the US, you don`t know, how much just the shipping to Europe costs!) , cause I loved the songs from the first moment and the album wasnt published in Europe, yet.<BR>Its the perfect music for everybody, who hides a dark soul behind a well-behaved cover (or a well-behaved soul under dark cover)!<BR>I guess without this songs, `Daredevil  wouldnt be that great. (P.S. If you like wonderfull, but dark music, search for `Within Temptation, a Dutch Band)
B000005JA8|5.0|I have been listening to this album for a good part of 25 years, it sounds normal to me, I try to start my day with it. It's when I listen to mainstream radio, or when the T.V. is on, it's always more of the same. Give this one a try, let your mind crack like custard, and spend some interesting hours. Chances are, it will put a smile on your face.
B00005JK8K|1.0|In true John Woo style, it's all action, action, action!<BR>Sound mix and transfer are both very good.<br />Unfortunately the story and script are bottom-rung. <BR>It kind of ends up looking like a montage of cool explosion scenes, stuck together with scenes of Cage trying to pull off the 'deeply disturbed' yet 'caring' battle veteran.<br />I'd recommend it for you sound freaks, you'll no doubt get off on the audio picnic (mind you it is only 5.1).<BR>But for anyone looking for a deep, 'thinking persons' war flick, steer clear.<br />A, Platoon, Thin Red Line...even Saving Private Ryan it is certainly not.
0743244249|4.0|Don DeLillo has changed gears yet again for his latest novel.  After dazzling everyone with his opulent epic \\"Underworld\\" and slowing down to the speed of a crawl with its follow-up \\"The Body Artist\\" he once again moves his exploration of American culture to another avenue with \\"Cosmopolis.\\"<br />The story, set in New York before 9/11, is classic DeLillo (in the same vein as \\"White Noise\\") as he follows a twentysomething financial guru through his day with his ultimate goal being, getting a hair cut.  While his speculation and investments in the Yen spiral up and down he meets with his advisors, his proctologist, his estranged wife and a few lovers.  This story is a day in the life of a pseudo-dot.com anointed billionaire on the edge of losing everything to the eventual disintegration of the tech bubble.<br />The language is exciting, but simplistic and very dry.  The characters (other than the protagonist) are a little thin, but this is not a character study.  It is a moment in time of the greatest economic boom in our country's history, prior to the most tragic and uncertain moment in our history.<br />This novel could very well be the last definitive statement on pre-9/11 life in the United States, while at the same time encompasing the fear and uncertainty that inevitably laid ahead.
0553573403|5.0|Wow this book blew me away, never before have i read so many pages in such a short amount of time. I love the fact you can not identify who is good and who is evil most characters seem to be somewhere in between, or throw you for a loop. A game of thrones is one hell of a good ride!
B000000W5B|4.0|This album has always suffered in comparison to it's predecessors, &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; and &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, and in reality abruptly ended a remarkable string of rock masterpieces that commenced with &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; in 1968. This is not to say this album isn't rewarding in it's own unique way, and in fact is one of their stronger efforts. &quot;Dancing With Mr. D&quot; is no &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; or &quot;Rocks Off&quot; in terms of killer opening tracks, but is pretty funky nonetheless. &quot;Silver Train&quot; is one of the Stones' best 70's blues workouts and it's refreshing to hear the band stay true to it's roots. &quot;Angie&quot; and &quot;Doo Doo Doo...&quot; are here and the album is worthwhile owning for these tracks alone. &quot;Can You Hear The Music&quot; is a return to the mystic rhythms and psychedelic themes of the &quot;Satanic Majesties&quot; album. &quot;Star Star&quot; is a vulgar exercise in Chuck Berry riffing and ends the album on an uptempo note. For the novice Stones fan, this is the 70's album to buy after the aforementioned &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, &quot;Exile&quot; and &quot;Some Girls&quot;.
B00000DCHE|5.0|Billy Joel's live performances on this album are superb and remastered to the best sound quality.  Never have i heard an album so crisp and clear.  You feel like your in the arena of the live show.  Every track is so alive and soulful at its best.  Miami 2017 and Say Goodbye To Hollywood are definately the highlights and the most intense live recordings.  Los Angelenos and Streetlife Serenader are  awesome tracks that are amped up and made upbeat compared to the original recordings.  Every song was given life to in its own unique way and this is the way the songs were meant to sound.  I listen to this cd almost every night and i love getting high while listening to it.  Captain Jack is my inspiration.  You can imagine yourself cruising down Sunset Boulevard or Broadway while listening to this record.  To this day i find no live cd comparable to it that makes you feel more alive.
B00003CXSP|1.0|An unnecessarily graphic and grotesque follow up to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". It jettisons most of the psychological byplay between Lecter and Starling that made \\"Silence\\" so good, in favor of \\"how-can-we-top-this?\\" graphic violence. By the time it reaches the final \\"dinner party\\" scene (I'll spare the details), it's not so much gross as it is ridiculous. Julianne Moore is very good given the thankless task of filling Jodie Foster's shoes as Clarice Starling, but Sir Anthony Hopkins becomes a parody of himself as the titular Hannibal Lecter. It's not his fault, mind you. Thomas Harris and Ridley Scott just forgot that what made Hannibal the Cannibal so menacing was not seeing what he did so much as imagining what he could do.
0316666343|1.0|I was utterly unimpressed by this novel.  I can't believe I heard someone actually call this book a literary work of art?<BR>The appeal of this book is much like 'rubber-necking' a highway accident.  The idea of death-rape-family breakdown is not a new theme, nor did I find Sebold's approach to it fresh and exciting.  The ending is patchy, slapped together, and she could have done a much better job to bring the ending together to save the rest of the book.
B000067IZ3|5.0|After \\"The Limey\\", \\"Erin Brockovich\\", and now \\"Traffic\\", is there any question about Steven Soderbergh's place as one of cinema's top directors? Intelligent, complex, and stylish, \\"Traffic\\" weaves multiple storylines together about America's drug trade, where the good guys aren't always good, the bad guys aren't always bad, and every character does what he/she needs to do to survive. Benicio Del Toro, with his soulful eyes and world-weary demeanor, is a revelation as Javier Rodriguez, the Mexican cop teetering precariously between what is legal and what is right. Also strong are Don Cheadle as a bulldog-tenacious DEA agent, and Catherine Zeta-Jones as the drug kingpin's wife who'll do anything to protect her family and her lifestyle. My only minor quibble with \\"Traffic\\" concerns a subplot about \\"Drug Czar\\" Michael Douglas's drug addicted daughter that tap-dances dangerously close to \\"Lifetime\\" territory. Douglas redeems it at the end, though, with a final, heart-wrenching moral stand at a White House press conference. \\"Traffic\\", hands down, was the best film of 2000.
031286504X|5.0|Richard Matheson is without a doubt one of the greates horror writers of all time. I am Legend is the most brillant piece of vampire fiction that I have ever read- and trust me I have read almost all of it out there. I am a Master's student in Literature and I took a vampire literature course as an undergrad, where I read I am Legend for the first time. Matheson is brillant, and many of the stories that were in the book in addition to the title story were made into Twilight Zone Episodes, which I realized after watching 48 hours of Twilight Zone over New Years break- the stories seemed uncanny, so I check the writer of the episodes- and sure enough- Richard Matheson.  Not to mention, years ago as a teenager I watched the movie Trilogy of Terror which scared the pants off of me,  the scariest part was one which I found out in college was inspired by Prey, a short story in I Am Legend. Matheson is truly a great horror writer, who will scare your pants off.
B00003CXE7|2.0|A sluggish, lumbering, behemoth of a film that proves lavish sets and period costumes do not an epic make. Russell Crowe is alarmingly uninspiring as the wronged Roman general, Maximus. Only Joaquin Phoenix shines light on an otherwise drab film as the ... confused, dysfunctional Commodus.
B00005JLRT|5.0|It is about time the Romulans were the bad guys!  A good action film with a few boring parts like any movie (ussaly with Schinzon) but overall it is funny... the charactors have not been so real since the original generation movies.  I never thought they would really beat First Contact though I loved Generations for being an odd number movie.  I am waiting for the special dition DVD which should have alot of nifty deleated scenes :)
B00003CXAW|5.0|Happy 70th Birthday to King Kong which was first screened in March of 1933 in New York City. What can you say about this quintessential American film. Phenomenal! The King Kong team did a great job in making an audience care about the fate of a giant ape. Simply the best film ever! A must have on DVD.
B00006JDVV|3.0|I found it entertaining and could suggest renting it. I could not suggest buying it because for my money I perfer movies that I can better relate to and watch over and over. I have no desire to view this movie again. Once was enough. This is not a bad film however it was not a keeper for the long term.
0679843302|5.0|My two daughters have absolutely loved this book.  They loved making the animal sounds as the baby bird encountered each new animal!  Very educational and extremely engaging!
B00000IPAX|3.0|I was a Blink fan when they first came out, but they don't have the great style of the old-school blinkstreet i used to know. Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch were great, but now they are just another pop/punk poser band. the only songs I dig on this are adam's song, and a few other's but adam's song in particular. (which is pretty strange because it's nothing like their old stuff. it's not even their style. it is a great song though.) if you're into the new popular punk scene with the new popular blink 182, buy this disk. if you long for the old stuff, this is not for you. peace out.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I totally love this music! Trust me, you don't need to speak german to enjoy this album. The lead singer has an awesome voice, and the guitar Rocks! it's especially good if you have a good sound system and you crank it! i Recommend this album to any heavy metal fan!
B00000JG41|4.0|Mr Bungle has long been known for writing material where the musical genres change within any song.  This is the first time they've managed to make the genres actually coexist.  Listen to &quot;Ars Moriendi&quot;. Is it klezmer? Is it pop? Is it thrash metal?  It's actually all these things concurrently.  &quot;None of them Knew they Were Robots&quot; is another example of how genres can co-exist.  This is song-writing not evident on either their debut (which uses genre changes for left turns in each song) or even the brilliant &quot;Disco Volante (which I still prefer over this one).<br />The songs are more melodic, as others have pointed out; you can hum along to them. The big &quot;iron fist&quot; that usually shows up to jerk the mood around is nowhere to be seen.  That's because it is no longer needed.  &quot;Pink Cigarette&quot; is a creepy song, and other than the background shrieking towards the end, there was no need to add in distorted guitars, screaming vocals, and miscellaneous white noise.  As you hum along, an eerie feeling is slowly building.<br />The album is fairly short, which is a negative for these guys, who release albums only every so often as Mr Bungle.  Also there are a couple of tracks that just don't measure up (sorry Trevor, but &quot;Retrovertigo&quot; would have been filler even on the last Faith No More album, which wasn't particularly strong). <br />But as Mr Bungle takes off their masks, and reveals a more personable quality that actually lets the listener in on the joke, it's clear that music is still moving foward.  The future is here, the future is now, and Mr Bungle is already there.  It's really too bad the industry, who has resorted to computer software to determine their next one-hit wonder, might not be around to see what they come up with next.
B0000057C5|4.0|I really love the music, and because I understand German, it makes it that much better! Trust me though, even if you don't speak german, and you love heavy metal, you will think this band ROCKS! The lead singer has a very cool voice and the guitar is awesome! The album &quot;Mutter&quot; is the only album that I've heard so far, but I've listened to a few tacks from the other albums and they sound great! i definately recommend these guys to any metal fan!
B00007E8O5|5.0|One of the greatest sets I've ever heard.  I recieved for my birthday only ever hearing \\"Angel Eyes\\" and \\"Anger Rising\\", but when I heard the rest of the material, I was amazed.  Cantrell knows how to carry a listening audience out of their seats.  Their music is dark, mysterious, powerful.  Each song carries a special message.  \\"Angel Eyes\\" is one of the best love songs ever created.  This is definitely an underrated CD, for sure, but it definitely the best I've heard.
079284470X|5.0|I don't know if I'll lose my membership card in the \\"He-Man Tough Guy\\" club for reviewing \\"Mannequin\\" but, hey, I'm a risk-taker ... 8)<br />This is a fun movie.  Kim Cattrall is a lot of fun as the Egyptian princess-turned-mannequin that comes to life.  Andrew McCarthy is pretty good as the mannequin designer shocked to see his creation come to life.  Estelle Getty (Golden Girls) steals every scene she's in, as the struggling department store owner.<br />Some of the especially fun scenes are the mannequin taking a hang-glider for a flight *inside* the multistoried department store.  The mannequin and McCarthy's characters created fresh, animated mannequin displays which create a buzz among passersby.  And they do a few take-offs, from \\"Ike and Tina Turner\\" and \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", among others.  A young James Spader is almost unrecognizable as the mean store supervisor.  I think they had a lot of fun making this movie.<br />Of course, Starship's ubiquitious \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\\" is all over the credits.  But it's still a good song.  In one memorable scene, a bulldog suffers a nervous breakdown after seeing the mannequin come to life.  There's a bit of innuendo and mild language, so you'll have to decide if it's OK for your kids to watch.<br />Ladies, this is your kinda flick.  Men, don't admit you enjoy it, just tell people your girlfriend or wife \\"made\\" you watch the film.  Then, nobody need ever know! LOL!
B0000069NM|5.0|The main reason why i'm writing this review is in reaction to claims that sco is mainly sleeping over MMW's backing and conclusions that this is more of a MMW record with guest artist John Scofield.  What bugs me most in such affirmations, besides the fact that it feebly attempts to incapacitate one of the greatest musician of our time, is that it proves that alot of people forget of one of the fundamental goals of music and more specifically, jazz, which is to share ideas, and build over them in order to create music.  Considering that, I don't see anything bad in the fact that MMW are exceptionnal musician and that their ideas and playing strongly colors the music on \\" A go go\\", in fact, i believe that it's part of this album's beauty.  <br />As for john scofield's role on this cd, it appears obvious that he leads the band, even though it doesn't work at restraining the other musician's room, which would choke the lot's creativity.  To me, the first thing that stands out is the scoish nature of the compositions, as they are truly simplistic, sign of sco's minimalistic approach to music.  Some may not like it, but than they should like sco's playing either.  What i find most interesting about the songs is that their almost deceptive plainness does very well at hiding their harmonic depth and richness (  Sco, sco and more sco.).  Finally, the music suggests absurdity and humour, as a confimation of sco's taste and of his mastery at relating music to images.  <br />I would also like to underline the fact that the outstanding expressiveness and the awsome use of attack, time and dynamics that sco displays through his work makes him one of the players that has displayed new ways of using the guitar's possibilities.<br />One last comment, who would dare to say that an album like kind of blue isn't a Miles Davis work, even though the beauty of it comes from both his playing, his ideas and the work of the others ?  Well, maybe it is more of a coltrane album, or a bill evans album ?  who knows ????  <br />eee
B000066NW0|5.0|If you can show me someone that you think is better than Avril and you can convince me that it's true, i'll give you a hundred bucks! The tracks on 'Let Go' are the best on any CD. They are all [obviously] from her heart. Avril doesn't try to be someone she's not. I can completely relate to her songs, especially &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; and &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;. I would definately recommend this CD.
0671027344|5.0|I first read The Perks of Being a Wallflower when I was just starting my freshman year of high school. At the time I thought the book was fascinating, exciting and above all else, I could really relate to Charlie. We all feel like wallflowers sometimes in our life and Charlie made me realize that I wasn't alone. When I picked up the book for a second time, as a senior coming towards the end of her last year of high school I was left with a somewhat different.<br />Charlie is a wallflower. He begins his freshman year of high school very confused. He is friendless, a result of his only friend Michael, committing suicide only the year before. Most people think of him as weird because of his easy ability to cry and the fact that he's so quiet. When he meets two seniors named Sam and Patrick, everything changes. His time as a wallflower is ended and it's finally time for him to step out onto the dance floor. Sam, Patrick, and their other friends begin to integrate him into the real world by exposing him to sex, drugs, rock and role, and the Rocky Picture show. Charlie begins to learn about friendship, sexuality, while learning how to understand his complicated family. Charlie's freshman year is one of the most effective years of his life.<br />It's strange to read Charlie's story again. I find myself a little surprised at his naivety and vulnerability, something I didn't notice when I was fourteen. It just proves that Charlie acts very much like a freshman in high school, even though he is a bit strange. If you really look at the way the book is written it even sounds a lot like a freshman in high school would sound like. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a touching book about growing up in a difficult time. I suggest reading it if you are like Charlie, a freshman. Read it if you're just a teenager. Read it if you're an adult. No matter how old you are you'll get something out of this powerful short novel. I highly recommend it!
0679721037|4.0|Hersey brought to light the true horror that thrust humanity into the atomic age, Hiroshima.  Often, in the United States, we see the bombing of Hiroshima as a means to an end.  Some say the use of atomic weapons during World War II saved millions of American lives, and perhaps those sentiments are true. However atomic weapons have also brought Americans to the doorstep of hell all too often. It wasnt so long ago that Kennedy and Khrushchev stared down the barrel of nuclear annihilation, both holding the fate of humanity in the palms of their hands.<br />Oppenheimer was right. Following the first atomic test, he recited words from the Bhagavad-Gita, Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.  And in a way, he had become death.  He opened a Pandoras box that can never be resealed.<br />Since we are destined to live with the threat of nuclear weapons, it is all we can do to attempt to halt the proliferation and use of said weapons. Herseys book reveals the havoc that even the smallest atomic weapon can cause.  Today, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima is nothing more than a childs cherry bomb, compared to the multi-megaton warheads that point across national boarders.  And this revelation is what makes Herseys book so important.  It gives us a taste of what is to come if we cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war.
B000063CMK|5.0|Pain of Salvation are one of those bands that you'll probably either love or dislike rather strongly.  There are many elements in their music that some people find awkward, irritating, or just a little too melodramatic.  I can understand that, but I'd disagree.  I'm very much in love with this band.  This album was a bit weird when I first heard it, but repeated listenings allowed it to grow on me to the point where it's one of  my favorite albums.  <br />The first time you hear PoS, you will probably not know what to think.  But, I recommend that you don't give up there, and try a few repeated listenings.  This band is known for growing on you.  Anyway, let me get to an actual review now...<br />If there's one thing about PoS' music, it's that it's diverse.  Heavy metal, rock, ballads, jazz, (a little) rap-metal, and more.  If you think, \\"no way!\\", well, buy this album.  It's done well, in my opinion, and it's really impressive.  <br />This is a concept album, not told in chronological.  What an interesting idea.  It's executed very brilliantly I must say, and Daniel Gildenlow's lyrics are awesome.  Many themes, musical and lyrical, come up several times in the album.  This is a real concept album, jack.  The musicianship may not stand out at first, but listen closer, you will hear subtle polyrhthyms and time changes and excellent atmospheric keyboards.  The guitars play in odd time signatures as well, and Daniel Gildenlow and Johan Hallgren bust some pretty mean solos.  As a singer, Daniel Gildenlow's range is simply amazing.  He can sing metal, nice ballads, and he can let out those high pitched screams like Rob Halford!  (OK, maybe he's not quite as good, but close).  He sings with great emotion also.<br />Some highlights for me:  \\"A Trace of Blood\\" is probably my favorite song.  The subject matter is rather unpleasant, but executed oh-so well.  This is actually also a pretty good example of their style.  The verse is sung in DG's low metal growl.  The song thentransitions to an emotional chorus and later you get to hear his Halford scream.  \\"This Heart of Mine\\" is a pretty ballad, coming to a powerful finish with an excellent guitar solo by Gildenlow.  \\"Undertow\\" is a dark song, and the end is also very powerful.  \\"Rope Ends\\" shows many odd time signatures.  The jazzy buildup/solo section is quite cool.  \\"Dryad of the Woods\\" is a beautiful song, the acoustic guitars and piano mixing are heavenly.  \\"Second Love\\" is a good ballad, with another excellent solo from Gildenlow.  \\"Beyond the Pale\\" is the album's finale.  Recalling many musical and lyrical themes, and also many different styles of music.  This song is the most powerful one on the album, and an amazing finale to a great album.  <br />Well, again, you'll either love this, or you won't at all.  But, one thing's for sure, you can't judge them by hearing only one of their songs one time, because they're diverse and known to grow on you.  If you're interested in prog. or metal, check this out.  Really, I could recommend this to anyone, because who knows if you'll like them?  Bottom line: Look into this album.
0688170528|5.0|I recently read The Pact by Jodi Picoult. This story was about a relationship that kept growing since birth. Two people, Emily and Chris, loved each other so much that they would rather die than hurt each other. <br />Jodi Picoult was born in 1966. She got a BA from Princeton University, and then she went to Harvard University. She published The Pact in 1998. Many other novels were written by this author. Some of those books include: Songs of Humpback Whale, Harvesting the Heart, Picture Perfect, Mercy, Keeping Faith, Plain Truth, and Salem Falls. I am definately looking forward to reading more of her writing.<br />This book has become one of my favorite novels. It kept me interested from the first page to the last. There were even times when I became emotionally involved in some parts of the book. When a sad event happens, and all the sudden your eyes well up with water, then thats when you can tell that the book did what it was supposed to do. The type of love Chris and Emily had for wach other is very rare. They were basically one person stuck oin two different bodies. When Emily becomes pregnant,she fears that both sets of parents would never understand therefore she decides to commit suicide with Chris at her side. When he survives, he gets blames for the death of his love and gets put in jail. I rate this book as a 5 because i couldn't be any better.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|&quot;The Money Pit&quot; is an underrated, romantic, slapstick comedy telling the story of an unmarried couple that unwittingly decides to purchase a large house in dire need of repair.  The couple, Walter Fielding, Jr. (Tom Hanks) and Anna Crowley Beissart (Shelley Long), have a strong relationship until Anna's former husband, Max Beissart (Alexander Godunov), returns to claim the apartment where they have been living in NYC.  Being forced to move, Walter and Anna decide to purchase a house and find what they believe is a dream house being sold by a seemingly eccentric widow, Estelle (Maureen Stapleton), in Long Island.  Walter and Anna hurriedly purchase the house and move in.  However, after a series of mishaps, they soon discover that their dream house has a number of problems.  Having both invested a sizeable amount of their savings into the house, Walter and Anna have no choice except to hire contractors with dubious reputations to repair the problems.<br />Anyone who has dealt with home repair issues (as I have) will no doubt identify with the trials and tribulations endured by Walter and Anna.  Of course, many of the mishaps they experience in the film are exaggerated but very memorable, including the falling staircase, the crashing bathtub and the exploding kitchen.  Naturally, stress resulting from the amount of money invested, the various mishaps and the prolonged loss of privacy due to the presence of many construction workers severely tests Walter and Anna's relationship.  Max's presence as conductor of the symphony where Anna performs as a violinist doesn't help matters either.<br />Being an exceptional actor, Tom Hanks did an excellent job with his portrayal of Walter, ranking equally with his performances in &quot;Splash&quot; (1984), &quot;Big&quot; (1988) and &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; (1990).  Shelley Long's performance is also quite good.  Other memorable characters in the film include the Shirk Brothers (the dubious contractors): Art Shirk (Joe Mantegna) and Brad Shirk (Carmine Caridi); as well as construction foreman Jack Schnittman (Josh Mostel).  Sadly, when the film was released in 1986, it was snubbed by critics and earned poor box office receipts.  Admittedly, the film is not perfect, but I rate &quot;The Money Pit&quot; with a very strong 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good slapstick comedy or to anyone contemplating the purchase or renovation of a house.  The film also has a strong and simple lesson: buyer beware.
B000001F3C|5.0|Probably the best of their early work.  Here, they are still very much just an extremely solid rock and roll band.
0345451325|5.0|I'll amit at first I felt a little goofy about buying this book.  That sentiment vanished as soon as I finished the prologue.  This book is well written, fast paced, and wondergully detailed.  I have never struggled to put any book down, until this one came along,and I finished it in a day and a half.  The story of how the Master Chief came to be will definitely compell you.  I now play the game with much more understanding of where the story has been and where it is goind.  Overall a wonderfull read!
0380725398|3.0|This is a well written book with vivid descriptions of places and people.  Maybe I was expecting too much.  It was a little more dark and depressing than I would have liked for a vacation read, and it held nowhere near the suspense and intrigue as Rebecca (one of my favorites).  It never really made me care for the lead character (Mary) - I just kept feeling that everything she did was stupid and for no reason. It was also very predictable since you know who is going to turn out to be the bad guy as he is the only other character you've been introduced to.<br />Not duMaurier's best.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Metropolis was quite a stunning film for its time.  It had &quot;Star Wars&quot; quality special effects which were unheard-of back then--all amazingly done by hand and combined with tedious optical effects.  Considering the massive effort and talent required, it was far more ambitious and deserving of praise than Star Wars, which had the luxury of more modern technologies to fall back on.  If you view Metropolis in this context, and consider the time period, you can't help but be impressed.  In fact, as you watch it, imagine the amazed reaction it must have received in theaters back in the 1920's.  Audiences at that time had never seen anything like it.  For at least the next 50 years, this film held its own--quite a feat.<br />The Kino-produced DVD is in itself impressive.  It is the absolute best version of the film ever to be made available in any form to the public.  The video quality is astonishing considering the difficulty they must have had finding good prints to work with.  The audio, too, is superb.  You'll really enjoy the extra bonus material as well.<br />So get this DVD, pop up some popcorn, turn out the lights, and transport yourself back to the 1920's.  You're really going to love this one.

B000089RVX|5.0|This is a great CD. This is where Britney meets Linkin Park and add in a little orchestra and you get evanescence. All the songs are good, unlike most other CDs. This one you can actually listen all the way through without getting annoyed by any of the songs. Amy Lee definately has a voice that could make any song sound good. Unlike most rock bands, they added some piano and violin to the mix, which gives a new fresh sound. I recommed this to any one who likes hard rock or metal....
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird, by Harper Lee belongs in the pantheon of great American novels like Huck Fin. Indeed both stories are about children peering beneath the veneer of Southern life and coming face to face the ugly secrets of class distinction and racism. The discoveries of such secrets always lead children ultimately to the loss of their own innocence. However, unlike Huck Fin, Jem and Scout have Atticus Finch, their father, to guide them.  Atticus is aware he can't keep the world away from his children forever. Perhaps it is for this reason that Atticus, a lawyer, decides to represent a black man wrongly accused of rape. Atticus is that rarest of people, a man who is willing to lead by example. It is the example Atticus sets for his children during this trial which will stay with Jem and Scout for the rest of their lives. I read To Kill A Mockingbird first in middle school and again years later during college.  Upon my second read I was stunned by how much of the book I didn't understand during the first read. Everyone should be forced to read To Kill a Mockingbird twice. Full of profound and deeply moving truths regarding human nature, To Kill A Mockingbird is a complex and beautifully written novel.<br />Preston McClear...
B00005U8EM|5.0|Right up there with \\"Planes, Trains & Automobiles\\" and \\"There's Something About Mary\\" there's my favorite Billy Murray comedy.... \\"Goundhog Day\\". Murray (as TV Weatherman Phil Connors) is easily the movie's lone Hollywood star, as the rest of the cast are much lesser known in the field. Andie MacDowell was probably better known for her career in modeling in 1993, than as an actress... she does a simply wonderful job as \\"Rita\\" the TV Producer. Chris Elliot does a fine job in a less annoying role than he's used to as \\"Larry\\" the cameraman (he's come a long way since being \\"The Man Under The Stairs\\" on David Letterman). The other actor to really make an impression is the man with the recognizable face, but what's his name (Stephen Tobolowsky as life insurance salesman Ned \\"Bing!\\" Ryerson). Oh, and Scooter the groundhog. As for the story, Bill Murray is stuck in the same cold day (which happens to be Groundhog Day) in Punxsutawney, PA covering the now famous festivities. He keeps reliving the same day, over and over again. Everyday he sees the same things. Everyday he meets the same people... the man in the hallway early in the morning, Doris the waitress, the town mayor, etc. He decides to make the best of the situation and do whatever he wants... only because he knows he'll wake up the next day and it will be the same day all over again. As he grows tired of reliving the same day over and over, Connors shifts his focus to Rita. First, trying to impress her. Then, trying to really care for her. When he finally does break thru to her, the spell is broken and the next day appears. I rank some of Bill Murray's movies as classic... i.e. \\"Caddyshack\\", \\"Stripes\\", \\"Scrooged\\", \\"What About Bob\\", etc... but I put \\"Groundhog Day\\" at the top of the list. Easy choice for my #1 favorite Bill Murray movie. Also an easy pick for one of my top 4-5 comedies all-time. *****
B000002LFU|4.0|\\"Hello, I know you, I knew you, I think I can remember your name...name\\"<br />This album is a curiosity.  It is half-filled with pop confectionery and half-filled with some mysterious some politico-serious intensely layered fare.  This was the debut album with Warner Brothers and one of R.E.M.'s best-selling albums to date.  In it is portent of the next two albums to come...the uneven pop-throw-off of Out of Time and the acoustic brilliance of Automatic for the People.<br />Out of all of R.E.M's records I own it is probably the second to last of ones I relisten too...bringing up the rear would be \\"Out of Time.\\"  With that said though, the artistry of R.E.M. still make it better than most out there.<br />The nod to pop sensibilities don't stand up to time so well with songs like, \\"Pop Song 89\\", \\"Get Up\\", and \\"Stand\\" which seem to border on the slightly annoying more so than the timeless.  But songs like \\"World Leader Pretend\\", \\"Orange Crush\\" and \\"Turn You Inside-Out\\" are some of the band's best works.  \\"World Leader Pretend,\\" is densely layered with the interplay between Stipe and Mills voices blended beautifully together, \\"It's amazing what devices you can improvise, this is my mistake, let me make it good.\\"  Very apropos of the cold war world politics of the times.<br />\\"Wrong Child\\" is delightfully odd.  For some reason the voice of this song reminds me of a John Travolta Boy in a Bubble perspective...\\"I'm not supposed to be like this, but it's OK.\\"  I don't know if this has struck anyone else the same, but it's oddly alluring and lends the song intrigue.  \\"I Remember California,\\" is a bass line led mood piece...\\"lumberboys and girls with tans.\\"<br />Half of this album is brillance with depth the other half seems to be surface pop...but with that non-throwaway R.E.M. sound.  Turn to \\"Automatic for the People,\\" \\"Life's Rich Pageant,\\" or \\"New Adventures in Hi Fi.\\" if you're new to R.E.M. but if your a die-hard fan don't pass on Green.
B0000648WZ|5.0|Many people hate this movie because it is not accurately based on Robert A. Heinlein's famous book. Frankly, I'm glad it's not because I found his book incredibly boring. The movie was much more interesting.<BR>As for the Nazi references such as Carl's uniform: Do people really think that a director born in Europe and BOMBED by the Nazis would support them? The point he was trying to make was that democracy had failed, and they now lived in a \\"perfect\\" society governed strictly by the military. <BR>Definitely worth your buy.
0436231255|4.0|In Down and Out in Paris and London, George Orwell, otherwise known as Eric Blair, introduces his readers to a compelling tale that loosely retraces his own life during the time he spent in Paris and London in the thirties. In this semi-autobiographical chronicle, he records the hardships that he faced as a Parisian \\"plongeur\\" (a restaurant worker at the very bottom of the industry's hierarchy) and as a voluntary \\"tramp\\" in London. Clearly, Orwell's account is a very personal one; however, it resonates the destitution of so many others who were equally unfortunate to have been the victims of the post-war social reform failure and the subsequent Great Depression that descended upon the world in the late nineteen twenties and thirties.<BR>The author focuses on France and Britain in particular because these two countries, magnificent superpowers of the past, have abandoned their poor in order to pursue different agendas in terms of their political policy. During this era, France was much concerned with securing its borders with Germany. This was a reaction to the Great War, during which France suffered great losses in every aspect. Although Britain was not faced with similar issues as France, it struggled with its political instability that arose in the light of the economic hardship of the Great Depression. Orwell acknowledges the differences between the two countries but insists on the recurring similarities in the treatment of the lowest social class. In his account, Orwell presents several important issues that would most likely be overlooked or altogether unknown to those outside the lower social order that Orwell describes. He points out the invisibility of the lower classes, forgotten or made forgotten by those for whom hardship of this kind was unknown, the abhorrent conditions in which existence had to be made possible, and the practically inevitable maintenance of the same class order throughout their entire life. The presentation of these three main issues highlights Orwell's repudiation of respectable democratic society and outlines his disdain for this ideology that he believed to be a failure.
B00004VVN9|5.0|Not too many people have seen Showscan movies. For some reason, they were released in (I think) selected Chucky Cheese's pizza shops.<br />Some friends and I drove 2 hours across Missouri to see Showscan and it was the most realistic picture we had ever seen.<br />Showscan was a 65mm film presented at 60 frames per second (fps). Studies had shown this to be the frame repetition rate at which the brain would integrate the frames seamlessly and accept it as true motion. Most movies are 24 fps, although each frame is shown multiple times to reduce flicker.<br />But you can tell that it's not real. US TV, which operates at 60 fields per second approximates the Showscan presentation. The difference between this and normal films is obvious - most people can tell a video source from a film source. They may not know why the video seems to have more presence, but the frame rate is the answer.<br />Brainstorm was originally produced to use Showscan projectors for the times when people were experiencing \\"reality\\" with their headsets. This would have clearly stood out from the rest of the film, and would have seemed much more real.<br />Perhaps only Doug T. saw the project in the 24/60 fps version. I know I didn't. However, from my experience with Showscan, I can state without reservation that this would have been one hell of a film as originally conceived. The \\"reality\\" changes would have more than made up for any other problems with acting or scripting. The \\"WOW\\" factor would have overridden all other criticism.<br />As for the dialog and acting being a little clunky - well, have you ever seen early stereo or 3D movies? They tended to concentrate on exploring the technology instead of the picture. Perhaps Showscan could have evolved to the state that 3D did with Hitchcock's \\"Dial M for Murder.\\" Or perhaps not.<br />In any event, this would be an excellent roadshow movie (like the restored version of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\") to show what the movie should have been.<br />And perhaps on a future DVD we'll have the helmet versions of reality replaced with 60 fields per second video. The difference should be obvious.<br />Thanks, Doug, for trying to pull this off. If you ever want to invite me to see your master copy with Showscan, I'll be out in California in an instant!<br />Rick
B000002LOE|3.0|R.E.M.'s \\"Out of Time\\" is a recording of a band in progress, redefining their sound and coming out on the other end with their seminal critic and music fan's darling \\"Automatic For The People.\\"  Perhaps this is the band's shot at having some fun before they got down to brass tacks.  As such, it contains some real gems and others of just messing around.<br />This album gave R.E.M. the chance to collaborate with the likes of KRS 1 on \\"Radio Song\\" and Kate Pierson on \\"Shiny Happy People\\" and \\"Me In Honey.\\"  Well one out of three ain't bad if your batting in baseball, but Me In Honey is really the only song of that batch that still works.  R.E.M. is really in self-parody mode with Shiny Happy People even making fun of the song on a rare Sesame Street appearance.  It was their answer to critics' comments as to the seeming bleakness of their previous work to date.  It is a trifle but not wholly unenjoyable listen.  There are more annoying songs out there.<br />\\"Losing My Religion,\\" is no doubt a masterpiece meaning different things to different people.  Interestingly enough Stipe wrote it as having a crush on another and slowly breaking down the initial pretentiousness and nervousness involved in the pursuit.  It always had tones of religious disappointment and coming of age to me.  That's the beauty of music though, the song can mean to you what it will.  Great music in that song though.<br />If you are beginning with R.E.M., I encourage you to begin elsewhere.  If you are an R.E.M. fan though, buy the rest and save this one for the end.
B00005ATQH|3.0|Humbert Humbert, a European literary scholar, needs a place to stay for the summer before he heads off to his teaching position at a Ohio college. One needy, insistent lady attempts to lure him into her home, but Humbert is resistant to her offers--until he sees her 15 year old daughter, Lolita . . . one thing leads to another, Humbert marries Lolita's mother in order to get close to Lolita, and he writes about his secret, tortured passions in his diary. Meanwhile, the TV writer Clare Quilty has also set his sights on Lolita, and is aware of Humbert's infatuation for her. This will bode ill for the future of all three of them, especially for the jealous, conflicted, and pathetic Humbert.<br />I have not read Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita, so I have no point of comparison with it as I watched the film. Reportedly, though the screenplay is credited to Nabokov himself, Kubrick used relatively little of it as he adapted it for the screen. The result is a mixed bag. James Mason's performance as Humbert is outstanding--he captures the outwardly civilized, tormented, and unsavory nature of Humbert Humbert very well, with his dapper accent and body language. Shelley Winters also does a fine job portraying Humbert's shrewish wife, though the character is a bit one-dimensional. Sue Lyons, who plays Lolita, does not fare so well, though this is in part to her seeming too old to be a nymphet; she acts the part of a bratty late teenager than of someone who is just entering adolescence. Also, Kubrick's plan was to turn this moral tragedy into a kind of black comedy, which is why Peter Sellers (as Clare Quilty) shows up and tries to leaven the atmosphere. While Sellers is great at doing impressions, especially of the German Freudian psychiatrist, his performance feels out of place in a film that should be more about Humbert's internal conflicts. (When put in the right context, as in Dr. Strangelove, Sellers shines very brightly indeed.) Also, I'm not sure the circular structure of the film is necessary or effective, as all it did was to confuse me initially. The cinematography is not of particular note, which is a bit unusual for a Kubrick film, though the overall direction is tight and Kubrick already shows a mastery of rendering interior conflict and character without being too overt or obvious. (Lolita, in fact, is one of his most character-oriented films, debunking the idea that he prefers machines to humans or that his films are cold and lifeless.) But this early effort, while smooth and watchable, feels coy and underdeveloped, perhaps because of the censorship of the era, perhaps because Nabokov's book is inherently unfilmable--whatever the reason, Kubrick would go on to do greater work.of the film is necessary or effective, as all it did was to confuse me initially.

B000089RVX|5.0|After hearing &quot;Bring Me Back To Life&quot; on my local radio stations I became interested in the band. I actually went ahead and bought the CD based on recommendations I saw here. I urge anyone who is a fan of beautiful, touching, yet hard rocking music to pick up this CD. The lead singers voice is hauntingly beautiful and I have a heard time not hitting the repeat button after every song. &quot;My Immortal&quot; is definitely my favorite song so far, but all the songs are great. &quot;Bring Me Back to Life&quot; is only the tip of the iceberg.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|The late 18th century United Kingdom of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland was a great time to be a gentleman. One young, romantic, rakish man named Redmond Barry wishes to rise to this distinguished title: to have land, status, money, beautiful women, and to hobnob with the elite of the age. After losing the hand of his first love, Nora, to a captain in the army, Redmond resolves to make it his life's goal to gain rank, first in the army, then among Europe's aristocracy. He is not the most scrupulous of social climbers and lies, cheats, and fakes his way up. But there is misfortune awaiting him after he makes his way to the top . . .<br />Inspired by Kubrick's favorite 18th century paintings more than the Thacakaray novel of the title, this film could not be more different from Kubrick's previous film, A Clockwork Orange--it is almost free from blood, sex, and random brutality (and was accordingly rated PG). Many have accused this film of being lifeless and boring, but I beg to differ: while indeed the cinematography, the use of all natural lighting, authentic costumes, and realism are its most outstanding features, Barry Lyndon is emotionally restrained, but it is not underacted or devoid of passion. Emotions are there, but it's kept just under the surface, as etiquette demanded for people of Barry's rank at the time. The admittedly slow pace of the film reflects the slower pace of life of the age and also allows the viewer to take in the atmosphere much better than quick cuts and loud action allows. (It really is not a film suited for modern attention spans in that regard.) This is a historical film in the best sense--the point is to immerse yourself in a reimagining of the past than to follow a plot. The only thing, for me, that breaks that illusion is that some of the music is not quite of its period; Schubert's piano trio does not belong in the 18th century, but the 19th. It does fit the mood, though. (More Bach would have been appreciated instead.) Barry Lyndon is probably a film best seen on video, and absorbed in the comfort of one's home--it's a very leisurely film that probably would try the patience of a theater audience, but I can't imagine a better way to spend three hours on a lazy afternoon. This is, by far, Kubrick's most underrated film and a masterpiece of historical filmmaking.yndon is probably a film best seen on video, and absorbed in the comfort of one's home--it's a very leisurely film that probably would try the patience of a theater audience, but I can't imagine a better way to spend three hours on a lazy afternoon.

0618001905|3.0|After reading Stanley's \\"Into the Dark Continent,\\" and liking it a great deal, I was instructed by other readers to read \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" if I wanted to know \\"the truth.\\" I have read it, and the primary effect of having done so is to make me wonder about the transitory and ambiguous nature of the concept of \\"truth.\\"<br />Hochschild's book tells the tale of King Leopold II of Belgium and his decisive land grab of the Congo in the late 19th century, and also of Leopold's use of Henry Morton Stanley as a public relation's tool and a kind of \\"My man in Africa.\\"<br />In short, I have found the work terribly biased and slanted to the author's views. It is not a bad book, or badly researched in general. It is certainly worth reading as part of the literature of the time and place, but the author has come to the work with a point of view, which is obvious. Particularly his picture of the African explore, H.M. Stanley. His portrait of Stanley is lifted almost entirely from Bierman's \\"Dark Safari: The Life behind the Legend of Henry Morton Stanley\\" which has been for years a shamefully hateful and incomplete picture of Stanley, but the source that is currently considered the \\"true\\" portrait of the great explorer (Stanley's own autobiography is still the only source for his early life, but the author roundly dismisses it, of course, for its presumed embellishments).<br />Hochschild's picture of Stanley is the currently popular one: a massively insecure man given to self-promotion; a driven individual with a compulsive need to prove himself, stemming largely from his orphaned and neglected childhood. Thus the book is riddled with amateur psychology and wild leaps of faith and assumption regarding Stanley's motives and thoughts. For example:<br />\\"With every step he took in Africa, Stanley planned how to tell the story once he got home.\\"<br />\\". . . he was always sculpting the details of his own celebrity.\\"<br />\\"Livingston was haloed in Stanley's prose, for he was the noble father figure the younger man had long been looking for . . .\\"<br />None of these things the author has any way of knowing, and are all armchair assumptions. They reveal the author's own views, and the book is full of such opinions put down as fact.<br />One of the book's praised heroes is George Washington Williams, a black American and sometime journalist who wrote of the miserable conditions of blacks in Africa. Looking at the details of this man's life, a reader with a cynical eye might concluded this man was simply a bunko artist looking for the most profitable hustle. Throughout his many and various \\"careers\\" he lied about going to Harvard, he lied about having a doctoral degree, and he abandoned his wife and fifteen year old son to escape mounting debt that resulted from his various failed schemes - only to become engaged during a shipboard romance just before his death. One might expect a writer of Hochschild's obviously distaste for self-promoters would cast a cynical gaze to anything Williams might write about Africa. Surely, as he so keenly observed with Stanley, the author might assume that Williams had traveled to Africa to make a public relations splash for himself after his sensational writings of Africa. But, no, this is not the case. For Hochschild, Williams's writings of Africa \\"were a cry of outrage that came from the heart.\\" Once again, the slippery nature of truth is a matter of interpretation.<br />So, what is true? At the time of publication, Stanley's \\"Into the Dark Continent,\\" was considered true. Most Europeans believed that Africa was full of poor, unenlightened blacks living in squalor, subject to the whims of brutal rulers and slave traders; beings who desperately needed our help and the Christian faith. Today, Hochschild boosts the popular belief that Africa at the turn of the century was full of a contented people living in a workable, peaceful society, which was destroyed by the avarice and greed of white Europeans. What will be the truth in a hundred years?<br />So, finally, what is true? Well, that depends. What do you want to believe?ll be the truth in a hundred years?<br />So, finally, what is true?

6302293553|4.0|I wasn't sure I'd like &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; after all these years, but as soon as I popped in the videotype, I remembered exactly why I once found this film so funny.  The humor is incredibly irreverent and, after all these years, iconic.  Who can forget the argument about sparrows carrying coconuts to England, or the killer rabbit, or the serenade to Sir Robin?  The humor ranges from satire to potty jokes, from dark humor to downright silliness.  As with all Monty Python movies, the scenes hang loosely together, and some seem included merely because the writers came up with a joke over a few pints and couldn't bear to exclude it.<br />The film epitomizes Monty Python and the craziness of the British comedy group popular during the 1970's.  If you saw this years ago, you'll be surprised how funny it still is.  And if you've NEVER seen it, you should treat yourself, especially since lines from it continue to crop up in ordinary conversation.
B00003CX8I|3.0|I've collected XMen comic books for years, even liked the cartoon but when I went to see this movie I was disappointed.  ONe, Angela Bassett would've made a better Storm.  Two, Storm could've had more than 3 lines.  The plot of Magneto wanting to take over the world is fine but U wasn't that impressed with the movie.  Why?  In a way I think that animation or heavy special effects beyond a reasonable budget would make these films better.  The Matrix kind of has taken a monopoly on ways to demonstrate superhuman abilities and lo and behold this summer they'll be in direct competition.  Though the lines will be long an dthe theater inevitably crowded, I'll sensibly wait a few days, maybe go midday on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  Pay Matinee for both of them.  Lets hope Xmen 2 is better and not just geared towards 12 year old boys...
B000050FEN|5.0|In the best tradition of psychological horror that claims such memorable classics as \\"Dressed to Kill\\", \\"Psycho\\", and \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\"- this film will haunt viewers well beyond the final credits.  Director David Fincher skillfully constructs all the elements of suspense in this tale about a serial killer obsessed with the seven deadly sins:  gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and lust. The two detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) tracking him become equally obsessed - with capturing the killer before he completes his seven murders.  Freeman and Pitt have great on-screen chemistry that lends a gritty reality to the script.<br />Despite the gruesome plot, this film has an elegance rarely encountered in a commercial film. The suspense is beautifully taut - I caught myself literally holding my breath during certain parts. The pacing is deliberate but never slack, giving the viewer over two hours of intense drama.<br />Turn down the lights, jack up the surround sound, and settle into this tense thriller.  (And make sure you're not alone!)
B00006JQU1|5.0|I have played these works forever and have listened to so many recordings but the reason I like this one so much is Podger's ability to mezmorize without the use of vibrato, well she does use vibrato but only as an ornament. Her tone is warm and colorful, her staccato is powerful and completely convincing, her intonation flawless. If only I could play them this well I would be happy.<br />There seems to be an ongoing debate in the violin community about playing Baroque music with no vibrato and with authentic instruments. While I do not support this belief, I like all recordings for their subtle differences in tone and vibrato.<br />Of course my favorite solo Bach recordings are by Szeryng, Milstein, Hahn, Rosand, and Perlman (I like all of them for different reasons) but I enjoy this recording equally. Anyone who plays Bach that well should be heard and I look forward to her future releases.<br />I give this CD 5 stars without hesitation, her interpretation is completely unique.<br />Yummy!
B00008BRBG|4.0|I was hesitant about buying another version of anything by the Police, because I had the original CDs, then bought the boxed set and was pleased with that remaster, but WOW!  The sonic quality alone is above and beyond &quot;Message In A Box.&quot; Not to mention they went back to the absolute original tapes and recitfied the proper keys for some songs, namely &quot;Roxanne,&quot; which used to start off in F or Fsharp minor (somewhere in the cracks) and edged its way up to the original key of Gminor.  &quot;Can't Stand Losing You&quot; is the only standout as far as being too &quot;trebly&quot;--it needs a new mix.  Not my favorite album (it's a toss up between &quot;Regatta de Blanc&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;), but still retains the spirit and energy that they delivered in their live shows. It's nice to know that The Police have been given their proper recognition: definitive CD catalog and their slot in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing.  Amy Lee's voice is hauntingly powerful and unique.  Although the songs tend to be a bit formulaic, this is not just your average death/goth CD.  Every song will get stuck in you head, but because of how good they all are, you won't mind.  Some of the best songs are &quot;Going Under,&quot; &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; &quot;Tourniquet,&quot; and &quot;My Immortal.&quot;  You may not like the songs on the first listen, but as you listen more, the songs get better and better.  I have no doubt that Evanescence is here to stay, and you should have no doubts about buying this CD.  You will not regret it.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is smart, good looking and moves at a quick pace. You barely have time to catch your breath, and it's over. Watch this movie, end to end, then watch it again. It's the type of flick that runs your mind through a ringer, and leaves as many questions as it does answers. If you are the type of person whoe needs closed endings, this is not the movie for you. This incredible cast of actors were given roles that they could sink their teeth into. And, with the exception of Drew Barrymore's odd, lackluster performance (I could tell she was going for a certain effect, but it doesn't work), they sink fangs into their roles. Sure to be a cult classic.
B00007AJGH|5.0|If you haven't seen Roger Rabbit, it's probably because you weren't alive when this movie was first released in 1988. An incredible live-action and animation combination, containing special effects never before attempted in any film, Roger Rabbit took the country by storm and became the must-see hit of the summer. But things weren't so rosy prior to it's release. In fact, Robert Zemeckis claims people were literally walking out of the theater during the initial test screening.<br />If there was ever a movie that could fill a DVD with extras, it would be this one. Unfortunately, the first DVD release of Roger Rabbit was woefully lacking of additional material. I was going to knock a star off in sympathy for the fans who have to buy this movie twice, but I notice Touchstone offers a five dollar rebate for the \\"upgrade.\\" So what do you get? Well this edition contains two DVD's containing Roger Rabbit in Fullscreen and Widescreen edition plus the following supplementary material:<br />1) A simultaneous split-screen before and after featurette of the scene where Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) falls off the skyscraper and meets Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse on the way down.<br />2) A deleted scene dubbed \\"Pig Head\\" where Eddie is captured by Toons and released with a giant pig head drawn over him. His only way out, a long shower with a bucket of turpentine to scrub off and wash his animated attachment down the drain.<br />3) A featurette explaining the use of plastic puppets as stand-ins for the animation and voice acting from Charles Fleischer (Roger Rabbit) and others to give the impression of realism Hoskins could use during filming. Hoskins even went to mime school to learn techniques that would give them impression of throwing 60lbs of weight around, for instance, when all he was doing was moving air. If the judges saw the amount of work Hoskins had go through in order to act and react to these invisible characters, he probably would've won the best actor oscar for the year.  Less understandable, is Fleischer's odd insistence on wearing a Roger Rabbit costume throughout the taping. Lou Hirsch (the voice of Baby Herman) refused to wear a diaper.<br />4) A well done documentary of the making of Roger Rabbit including interviews with director Robert Zemeckis, Bob Hoskins, Charles Fleischer, and the animation and visual effects crew. Words and phrases like \\"survivor,\\" and \\"hardest movie ever\\" become commonplace. SFX house Industrial Light and Magic needed to create over 1000 visual effects shots for Roger Rabbit.  Prior to this, the most they ever did was 300 for Return of the Jedi. Long before CGI animation became commonplace, all animation in Roger Rabbit was hand-drawn, right down to the individual frame and a good portion of the interview is devoted to the trials and tribulations the animators went through.<br />Additional material includes the Roger Rabbit shorts that appeared in conjunction with other movies back in the 80's, a DVD game, and a THX optimizer to help dial in your home theater system. The companion booklet isn't much, just brief descriptions of what's on the different DVD's, but you also get autographed headshots of Roger and Jessica Rabbit (total babe!)<br />The menus are intuitive (hosted by Benny the Cab), but I couldn't move up and down the different selections to pick my choice. I don't know if it was a problem with my particular DVD player but the best I could do was select by number, which was problematic as the selections weren't numbered.

B000089CJI|5.0|First of all, this is the first album in quite a while id say is worthy of 5*s.  This album is original and exactly what mainstream music needs (or maybe its better nobody knows).  After rap-metal, boy bands, retro garage rock, and wanna-be creed singers, this album is the breath of fresh air after being held under water for five minutes. modern elektronica mixed with an 80's new-wave sound and the familiar indie rock melodies from death cab for cutie make this album sure to please just about everyone.  im just curious as to whether the live show will be able to capture the fun carried on the album.  if so, i have a feeling there may be a new musical trend on the way and the postal service just may be the catylist.
B00005YW4H|4.0|This is a great, soulful CD.  It's quite relaxing to listen to and a pleasant change of pace from today's pop!  Thanks Norah!
B000068PQ0|5.0|I bought this album on the hype. After the 1st couple of listens, I preached to everybody about how much music sucks these days, etc. But I kept at it because of the hype and some songs kept in my head even though I didn't really like it. By 8 times, it started to kick in. Now I listen to it twice a day. Tons of hidden gems in the album. This album, like Blur's \\"13\\", really takes time to get in to.<br />At first I just liked songs 2 & 3, but as time went on, I appreciated songs 6-9 the best. This is the mark of a good album when you like the stuff you didn't even like at first.<br />As someone who typically likes 2 albums a year, I recommend this with Beck's \\"Sea Change\\". I also liked the \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" by Oasis.<br />Did you know the FLs won a Grammy for the last song on the CD? Yep. And there are about 8 songs better than that song.<br />I highly recommend this CD, but you have to give it many tries to see what Wayne is trying to do here.

B00004VXF2|5.0|I can only imagine how this must have sounded in 1975(the year I was born) coming out off of vinyl, with no one else even coming close to this kind of sound. I'm kind of glad. Having heard the [stuff] that now passes for music I can't help but think Lou owned some kind of time machine and wanted the world to end before that came down upon us.<BR>Seriously this has more musical merit than any of the pop stars created by T.V. voting or marketing men. Yes, so it gives you a headache... and at least this isn't all over the radio.<BR>If you want to hear this you will, if you don't you won't, that's the bottom line...
0345403959|5.0|This book is a must for readers of the Belgariad and the Malloreon. It is well written and humorous, yet there is sorrow here too - the apparent death of Belgarath's wife, Poledra and the loss of his two sorcerer brothers, Belsambar and Belmakor (although the latter is not clearly explained). Although written after the Belgariad and the Malloreon, new readers would do well to read Belgarath the Sorcerer first, as this will greatly facilitate their understanding of the later series. Belgarath himself is a likeable character, full of human weaknesses and foibles despite his enormous power, and the continual bickerings between himself and his rather straight-laced daughter, Polgara, are delightful. He is lazy, lackadaisical and often untrustworthy, but he fulfils his destiny completely, and his love for his master, the god Aldur, is very moving. A great story about a great character, whom you will come to regard as a friend when you finally lay down this wonderful book.

This is a very interesting book, I learned a whole lot of information that I never knew before.

B00004Z4SD|4.0|David Lynch, one of the contemporary cinema's true magicians, converts his power to casting white magic in this quietly intoxicating ode to silent reflection and natural beauty.<br />One of the great keys to telling a great story on film lies in not what is said and done, but often what isn't. This is admittedly what often turns me away from Lynch's other works. Here, he embraces economy and finds gentle hope in America's heartland.<br />\\"The Straight Story\\" is exactly what the title implies: a story about sticking to the essentials of honest linear narrative structure and leaving out anything extra. It is so promising that this film was made even at all. All too often, Film makers treat their audiences like idiots and feel that every motivation, thought and reaction must be dictated through rapid editing, snappy one-liners, super stunts and CGI effects all set to a blaring soundtrack. <br />\\"The Straight Story\\" is a movie about quiet truths and requires the audience to fill in the blanks. Fine case in point: in the film, Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) listens to a woman vent about running over deer. As she screeches off in her compact car, Alvin simply stares down at the deer. Usually, the filmmaker will insist upon some quick quip that comments on the action and the character, but not here. We simply move on to see Straight cooking a piece of venison over a campfire while being stared at by a molded plastic deer lawn sculpture. The scene where Farnsworth and another aged actor whisper and bare the scars of the their wartime experiences is also another fine moment that simply happens. Lynch allows the camera to lovingly and tenderly hold on his actors' beautifully weatherbeaten faces. These are wise men who have seen much more than we could ever possibly imagine.<br />Sissy Spacek, Richard Farnsworth and the rest of the cast give fully fleshed out and three dimensional characters. The film is quietly moving without the slightest hint of sentimental seasoning.It earns its happy ending honestly. Thank you David Lynch for creating a genuine near classic work of American Film Art. A worthy addition to any home film library. And one the entire family can watch and enjoy.
0671015206|4.0|Millionaire Next Door is a great book, it uncovers so many secrets on how to be a millionaire. It totally changed my perspective on how I view millionaires. Great book that will keep you reading until the next page! This book uncovers so many things, like for example, millionaires don't necessarily use extravagant credit cards, drink the best wines, wear the best clothes, or drive the best cars. Millionaires also seem to always invest any extra money, and don't necessarily show what they always have.
B00003CXAW|5.0|First things first. As Warner Brothers has previously done with their excellent two disc packaging of such films as SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE and the Sam Peckinpah box set, KING KONG proves a must own. The transfer is beautiful and the extras are heaven for a film fanatic. A perfect world would have every film studio taking such pride in presenting their products for home video in such a professional, respectful and loving manner. <br /> <br />Here is a new review of the film, written after leading my high school Film as Literature class through a unit of study. <br /> <br />\\"All work is autobiographical\\"  <br />-anonymous <br /> <br />Like THE BIBLE or Homer's THE ODYSSEY, Merian C. Cooper's KING KONG features at its very core a search- a quest for truth and a desire to return home. Now finally released on a gloriously re-mastered DVD, Cooper's autobiographical film dressed in the clothes of a fantasy adventure has never looked so visually impressive or so resilient in its unbending desire to peer unblinking into the abyss residing in the heart of art and artists. <br /> <br />Filmmaker Carl Denham's (Robert Armstrong-giving the film's most textured and nuanced \\"human\\" performance) journey into a fantastic and strange new world recreates auteur Cooper's real life devotion to bringing the most unique documentary entertainment to his audience. Having previously traveled to the harsh and remote mountains of Iran in GRASS and the lethal jungles of Taiwan in CHANG - all after tempting fate as a combat aviator in World War I and in Poland, Cooper had experienced life on the precarious edge between life and death before undertaking the creating of KING KONG. Through the guise of Carl Denham, Cooper holds himself accountable for the ultimate exploitation of a savage and innocent world. <br /> <br />Shooting New York City and the interiors of the ship in largely stationary tight medium and close shots, Cooper reveals a distrust of the restraints of civilization. Once the intrepid travelers set foot onto jungles of Skull Island, Cooper opens up the camera, placing it on tracks and dollies- photographing glorious extreme long shots and long shots- obviously impressed by the scope and size of the savage world. This contrast in coverage communicates a clear bias Cooper has for the wild environments of the unsettled world.  <br /> <br />Utilizing a scenic design strongly reminiscent of Gustave Diore's eerie nineteenth century Biblical woodcuts, Cooper revels also in the sheer supernatural violence of the natural world. Through Denham, Cooper attempts to tame this world through the wonders of technology (guns, gas bombs, movie cameras- the image makes everything `permanent')-all with the intention of making a profit. Denham's intrusion onto the island upsets the fragile balance of power on the island, resulting in the needless deaths of several villagers, dinosaurs, sailors and of course, ultimately Kong himself (not to mention many New Yorkers and Navy pilots). <br />\\"It was beauty that killed the beast.\\" <br /> <br />Denham's lament over Kong's death at the base of the Empire State Building may reflect Cooper's great epiphany- it is the search for beauty (art) that leads to the death of beast (the innocent savage laying underneath us all). It is the intrusion of the documentarian (all for the sake of pleasing an audience) that spoils the purity of the unspoiled world. Denham knows HE is responsible for Kong's death. <br /> <br />\\"You can never go home again.\\" <br />- Thomas Wolfe <br /> <br />Denham isn't Cooper alone. Cooper is also Kong. <br />

The Giver gives Jonas memories of the whole world, and soon Jonas will learn a terrible secret about the society in which they all live.  His decision will effect the whole world. I certainly enjoyed this book very much, and I hope you will too.
B00006F83Y|5.0|It is one of the best albums I have heard in a while (especially in the alternative rock genre.) The tempos really drive this CD it just seems fast all the time, maybe it's because of Grohl's drums. The first song I liked was &quot;No One Knows&quot;, but now my favorite has to be &quot;A Song for the Deaf&quot;. The opener is really good too. You may think it's just a rock album but there is something about their sound that brings something new to music. The guitars and drums are immaculate (not to say that the singing is bad.)
B00005NRN9|5.0|While this is much shorter than the other Cirque du Soliel DVDs I have, it is definitely my favorite. Watching this story comes close to being a spiritual experience for me. Sure, the theme is contrived, and the performances are short, but somehow none of that matters. This DVD took my breath away the first time I watched it, and continues to do so every time I watch it again...
B00005UK1F|5.0|This c.d. is amazing. there isn't one part of the one song on this album that I coudn't listen to over and over. Green Carnation has done a great job and haven'tgotten any credit.
0151008116|5.0|I encountered this book and got it because of one of the most intriguing statements I've ever seen in a book jacket - that it may make you believe in God.  <BR>That is a strong statement and depends on the reader, but regardless this is a fantastic and inspiring novel.  Martel creates a beautiful and surreal landscape and complex and heart-breaking characters.  This is easily one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  You will experience almost every emotion you are able to, right alongside the characters, through the course of the book.

People that would like to save a little should read it. I would recommend it to my mom.

Room For Squares is already a great cd and he's topped himself with live versions of his songs.  The live versions brings these songs to life even more.  His voice couldn't be any sexier and the new intro's to the songs are extremely entertaining.  This is a must have!

Robert Kiyosaki's stories tend to be long-winded and simplistic, yet successfully teach the basic economic thought behind becoming rich. With little or no application explained, Rich Dad, Poor Dad serves as a somewhat introductory book and is perfect for students or those not already in the know. Overall, the book is a pleasure to skim or read and is positive and simplistic.
B000002L5P|5.0|Where to begin? With an album like this? With a band like this?  Well, at the start, I suppose...  The fifteen year old me is on a bus coming back from Manchester having just purchased the 7\\" vinyl of 'Hand In Glove'. I take the record out of the bag over and over again. Just to look at the cover. The John Peel sessions have whipped me up into a frenzy of anticipation and I get home and play 'Hand In Glove' at least seventeen times and the b-side 'Handsome Devil' thirteen times. It is love.    The Smiths were my band and by the time the debut album came out I fully expected it to be the greatest album of all time. Really. But then the fifteen year old me was disappointed. Why was the production so flat, why were live but unrecordable favourites like 'Miserable Lie' included, where were the songs I loved like 'This Night Has Opened My Eyes'...???   (Un)interesting fact : until the release of this album I always thought that 'This Night Has Opened My Eyes' was, in fact, 'Still Ill' because Peel had introduced then wrongly on the second, I think, session.  Whatever. More years than I like to recall have passed and listening to this album now I'm struck by how wonderful the whole of it is. True, there were better songs on the b-sides of singles then but this is still an all-time great album.  The easiest review would be one where you just quoted Morrissey's lyrics because they are near unbeatable here but then you would have to talk about Johnny Marr being the best guitarist of his generation and how, with hindsight, the production is actually okay and how The Smiths were the greatest band of their era. And so on.  Until you got on to the songs...'Reel Around The Fountain' quotes Shelagh Delaney and is one of the greatest Smiths moments, 'Pretty Girls Make Graves' is actually my favourite and then there is the re-worked 'Hand In Glove'.And so on.  'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle' is another favourite. I love Morrissey's poetry and the way the song just sort of sways along, hypnotic and dreamily beautiful. Simon Goddard in his excellent book on The Smiths, 'Songs That Saved Your Life' traces certain lines back, again, to Shelagh Delaney. Okay, but one thing I have never read anywhere is that the lines \\" So rattle my bones all over the stones/ I'm only a beggarman who nobody owns...\\" actually originate in James Joyce's 'Ulysses' when Bloom is going to a funeral of a friend and sees the coffin of a baby en route : \\"Rattle his bones. All over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.\\" You don't need me to tell you that Morrissey's appropriation there is genius.  So this isn't the greatest album of all-time but it is a very great one. What else to say? Where do you finish? With one of the greatest bands of any era, I suppose. The Smiths.

B00006G8G1|4.0|Tons of songs, excellent picture. Although one sidenote, you may want to put this through a stereo or surround sound, because when you dont, to me is sounds harder to hear bruce sing, maybe this is my dvd though, because my brother said he played it on his DVD and didnt have the same problem (of course he did put it through a stereo). Anyway, that is not my complaint, my only complaint is maybe a silly one, is with the band itself. Call it eighties withdrawl if you will (who knows) but i dont like their new image. Liked bruce with long hair, and I think they have lost some of their stage presence. Which is unbderstandable, they are not 20 anymore. I remember them in their prime, with the pyrotechnics, multiple eddie props on stage, bruce bouncing around like and idiot, it was wild. Still, this is a very good DVD. Buy it
0792844602|5.0|Ralph Richardson is wonderful, as is the rest of the cast, in this epic British war story, which recounts the \\"fall\\" and recapture of Khartoum, during the early unravelling of the British empire.  The plot involves the misplaced honor of a young man born into military aristocracy, whose bullying father convinces him that he is a coward, when in fact, he is the bravest of all his peers.  The plot is convoluted and melodramatic, but the film sizzles along in a good, old-fashioned action flick kinda way.  Alexander Korda's direction is skillful, swift and sure -- the battles scenes are sweeping and suspenseful, and the color cinematography is magnificently shot and beautifully composed.  Plus, a heroic score by Miklos Rozsa... what more could you want?  Yeah, sure, the Arabs and their so-called \\"fuzzy wuzzy\\" African allies are thinly realized caricatures, but they also mangage to rout the Brits for a decade or two, so the anti-colonial minded among us can read between the lines, if they wish.  A well-made, exciting action classic. Recommended!

B000056VJ7|5.0|The title track begins with jarring , jamming keyboards, rocking guitar that more or less reflects the hard-rocking tone of this all-time classic.  The main character here is someone who takes life by the throat in the dark, riding a &quot;silver black phantom bike.&quot;  With the line &quot;When the motor is hot and the engine is hungry&quot;, I'm not sure whether he's talking about the bike or himself, such is the hunger of the main character.  And even finishing ten seconds shy of ten minutes, it isn't excessive--worth every minute.<br />The opening narrative between &quot;the wolf with the red rose&quot; and the girl, probably Ellen Foley, in &quot;You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth&quot; is quite something.  The question, &quot;On a hot summer night, will you offer your throat to the wolf with the red rose?&quot;  After she presses him with all these questions, such as &quot;Will he love me?&quot;, &quot;Will he starve without me?&quot; and having been replied in the affirmative, she finally answers his original question, repeated, &quot;yes.&quot;  He says, &quot;I bet you say that to all the boys.&quot;  What a punchline!  Hey, women are like that!  It bursts into an operatic blaze of sound, the setting being a hot summer night on a beach, where the girl does the title action, just when he was going to say &quot;I love you.&quot;  The chorus is done a capella with handclaps at the end, in contrast with the rest of the song.<br />In &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, a sweet tender ballad, our main character, is feeling tamed by the girl, whom he equates with paradise.  Fate has a funny way in things, as he says, &quot;I got a taste of paradise/If I had it any sooner, you know I never would have run away from my home.&quot;<br />&quot;All Revved Up And No Place To Go&quot;  begins with a throbbing bass rhythm punctuated by Edgar Winter's sax, before going into frantic mode towards the final minute of the song.<br />The sad and heartbreaking &quot;Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad&quot; is a narrative of a man telling a girl why he can't love her, all beacause of some woman in his past who told him what he's telling her now:  &quot;I want you/I need you/But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you/Now don't be sad/'Cause two out of three ain't bad.&quot;  Yeah, but what a poignant one out of three!<br />Then comes the all-time gem of the album--&quot;Paradise By The Dashboard Light,&quot; an intense rocker punctuated by alternating by operatic power choruses.  The story is well-told on classic rock radio, a one-night stand, one night love affair, call it what you will, hijacked by the girl who demands a more lasting committment before she puts out.  Leave it to a woman to spoil things!  Kidding!  And when Ellen Foley shouts &quot;Stop right there!  I gotta know right now!&quot;  you better listen up!  The tempo really kicks up and the tension builds up especially when Ellen confronts him:  &quot;What's it gonna be, boy?  Yes or no?&quot;  And it keeps up when Meat Loaf responds with &quot;Let me sleep on it.&quot;  What a pressure cooker!  Professor Bittan's piano is unmistakable here.<br />&quot;For Crying Out Loud&quot;, which for a while has only Bittan's piano, later explodes with the NY and Philly Harmonic Orchestra.  As for the live tracks, the guitar instrumental intro, &quot;Great Boleros Of Fire,&quot; is a prelude to a live version of the title track.<br />Well-known musicians: Todd Rundgren on guitars and sometimes on keyboards and backing vocals, &quot;Professor&quot; Roy Bittan, best known on Springsteen's E.

If that's the case, then these versions come in second in a photo finish (Mingus re-recorded some of these because he was unhappy with previous edits).  The ensembles that Mingus leads here play fast and loose on the uptempo and show great sensitivity on the ballads.  Anyone interested in checking out the great Charles Mingus would be well advised to start here.  Those already familiar with his work, also will not be disappointed, even if they already own other versions of these songs.
B000001LKY|5.0|`Warrior On The Edge Of Time' is Hawkwind's sixth album, and fifth to consecutively hit the British charts, following `In Search Of Space' (no. 18 1971), `Doremi Fasol Latido' (no. 14 1972), the double live album `Space Ritual Alive' (no. 9 1973) and `Hall Of The Mountain Grill' (no. 16 1974). Add to this the incredible and unexpected success of the single `Silver Machine' (no. 3 1972). It was O.K. for underground/cult bands to have albums in the charts, but a hit single was quite extraordinary. I mean, a video of Hawkwind being played alongside performances by David Essex and The Bay City Rollers on `Top of the Pops' - unbelievable!<br />You will understand they were one of Britain's top road bands with a fanatical following, who crammed their nationwide concerts and talked knowledgeably about the contents of each album. By this time they had all but guaranteed their places in the annals of Rock `n' Roll history. Along the way creating space/rock, which was to become the cornerstone of later genres such as ambient music and house music. (Ah, Kiddies, got your interest now?)<br />To many this seventies lineup of Hawkwind will always be the classic lineup and, having been together for almost 5 years, one of the most stable, too. True, Poets, Dancers, Dik Miks, and Del Dettmars came and went, but the nucleus of the band was for Hawkwind very stable. Of course, Simon House joined as well, but nobody was fired, left behind, or spontaneously combusted.<br />Due to this remarkably uniformed period, and having spent most of the time on the road, including two ground breaking tours of the United States of America and three of Europe, with `Warrior On The Edge Of Time' Hawkwind managed to lay down their magnum opus.....if you like Space Rock's `Dark Side Of The Moon'. Everything felt right. The title alone left you in no mind what to expect. The artwork was simply stunning, standing out in all its glory amongst the other vinyl recordings in your local record store, featuring a single futuristic warrior on horseback gazing into the mists of time. Stirring stuff indeed.<br />The album roared into the British charts reaching No. 13 and remained in the charts for 3 months with all the songs being incorporated into the live show. Some of them cropping up now and again in Hawkwind's ever changing stage show today.<br />Bandleader Dave Brock was at the very height of his creative abilities. The album starts off with a two part epic recently voted Hawkwind's most popular song ever by the band's fanzines readers of Hawkfan.<br />The music starts off with a memorable bass line from Lemmy before the rest of the band break in with both drummers laying down a complex drum pattern. Dave Brock's chugging riff, Nik Turner's flute fluttering over the top, and Simon House holding the sound together with a wall of keyboard sound. Instead of it being a weakness by not having a lead vocalist, they turn it into a strength by using to good effect harmony vocals that add to the spacey effect and, of course, behind it all is the wonderful Hawkwind giving it lots of atmosphere.<br />After this opening volley lasting over ten minutes, (a wonderful live version of this song can be heard on the 1991 live album `California Brainstorming'), the famous American Sc-fi writer, Michael Moorcock, makes his first appearance, narrating the words to his own poem, very echoey with sonic keyboard and drum backing.<br />Next up is a very unusual feat as the two drummers in the band take sole song writing credit for the hard driving instrumental `Opa-Loka', which leads us nicely into another pair of Dave Brock songs. Of the two `Magnu' really stands out, which was to be one of the mainstays of the Hawkwind live set for many years, featuring an upbeat tempo that swirls and swirls round your speakers until Simon House comes in with one of the most exhilarating electric violin solo's ever laid down in an earth bound recording studio, `The Demented Man' reminds you of Dave Brock'searly days busking with his acoustic guitar on the streets of London. Even Spacenauts have humble beginnings.<br />Leading us into the second half of the Warrior adventure is Nik Turner's nicely over the top reading of Michael Moorcock's poem `Standing at the Edge'.. Next, is the most amazing piece of music on the album: `Spiral Galaxy 28949', written by Simon House, simply years ahead of its time. It is no wonder that three years later David Bowie head-hunted Simon to play keyboards and violin and be musical director of his road band for several years. After another Moorcock spoken poem, the album comes to a conclusion with Nik Turner's only composition on the album, a typical Hawkwind jaunt through `Dying Seas'.<br />Tagged onto the C.D release is the A &amp; B sides of the current single `Kings of Speed'. Not much more than a sub Status Quo 12 bar bash at the charts, but the interesting thing here is the version of the last song Lemmy ever wrote for Hawkwind, `Motorhead'. By the time of the album's release, Lemmy had been kicked out of Hawkwind, going on to form his own band and taking the name for the band from this song; as is well documented and becoming the leading band in Heavy Metal. Far more famous then Hawkwind would ever aspire to.<br />As for Hawkwind themselves, although they were never really reviled by the new wave of punk rock that hit in mid 77, nor did they ever recover. Within three years David Brock was the only remaining member. Although still going today in one form or another (there are actually two bands, Hawkwind with Dave Brock, and The Hawkwind Experience led by Nik Turner), they have never troubled the top twenty in the charts again.<br />But, to hear Hawkwind at their finest, sweep back the mists of time, put `Warrior On The Edge of Time' in your player, and enjoy the journey.<br />Mott the Dog.early days busking with his acoustic guitar on the streets of London.

0156421178|4.0|I wouldn't call it definitive, but Homage to Catalonia is a very engaging account of the Spanish Civil War.  Orwell wanted an infantry man's experience, drawn to the first person accounts of WWI by such authors as Remarque.  As a result, Orwell gives the reader an intimate view of the action, or rather inaction of the front line.  More compelling is his description of the street fighting which broke out in Barcelona, and the split that developed in the Socialist government, making it vulnerable to attack.<br />Orwell castigated Britain and France for not coming to the aid of the Socialist government, allowing Franco to gain the upper hand as the result of aid from Germany and Italy.  Orwell also underwent a catharsis in this book, losing his respect for the Communists, as a result of Stalin's notorious policies.  In the end, Orwell seemed angry at pretty much everyone for allowing Spain to fall into Fascist hands.<br />He maintained his respect for the anarchists, particularly the ex-pats who fought for the anarchists in the civil war.  But, Orwell seemed to realize it was a losing battle.  The anarchists were torn among themselves as they struggled for the heart and soul of the Spanish people.  Orwell never got to Madrid, unlike Borkenau and Hemingway, so his account is limited to the fighting which occurred in Catalonia.
B000002NC4|4.0|I don't know if this is referred to as a &quot;theme&quot; album, but I dont think it would be a misnomer. The songs on this album are long and expansive. They range over tempo changes, catchy lyrics, and good guitar work. Built to Spill is a chord driven group, they seem to believe in the connectedness of the song, which makes songs depend on bold chord selection. The songs borrow from each other, and seem to move in and out of shared themes. Martsch exploits tempo changes well and brings the listener into the music as he subtly attaches us emotionally the musical movement. This in and of itself makes this a fantastic album. It's redundancy makes it an album you listen to non-stop for a month and then not again for 6 months when you listen fanatically again...
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is probably HBO film's magnum opus.  You really get attached to these guys, although they tend to drop like flies.  And even if you're not a war buff you'll love the story telling.  As far as the fighting goes they don't pull punches, its more than graphic ....... its dalton trumbo graphic ....... different war, but you get the point.  It really brings to light the sacrifices these guys made for the rest of us.  I was so happy to see the ones who made it in Austria.  One of my favorite episodes, even thought there's very little action at that point.  When they took the 'Eagle's Nest' I admit I was grinning.  This is really a film.  Its so much better than any tv show i've ever seen.  I give it my highest recomendation.
B0000894RZ|5.0|I'm glad that Lisa has now a greatest hits album. This English fabulous singer who has sold up to 13 million copies worldwide gives us this great gift adding songs like: &quot;All around the world&quot; a 1989 hit that reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified Gold and its album Multi-Platinum thanks to only one song. Other hit singles from Lisa are: &quot;Never gonna give you up&quot; (cover from Barry White which was an instant hit in Europe, the US and Asia), &quot;The real thing&quot; (a 1997 hit which reached #1 on the Club Dance Songs from Billboard), &quot;Someday I'm coming back&quot; (from the multi-million selling soundtrack &quot;The bodyguard&quot;), &quot;People hold on&quot; (another #1 hit all through Europe), &quot;Let's just call it love&quot; (from her latest studio album &quot;Face up&quot;).<BR>Lisa is a singer who goes through pop, rock, ballads and disco music. She says that Barry White is a big influence in her career.<BR>&quot;Biography&quot; includes a bonus cd which features remixes and extra tracks such as: &quot;The line&quot; (from her 1997 hit album &quot;Lisa Stansfield&quot;), &quot;8-3-1&quot; and &quot;Never gonna fall&quot;.
6305910103|4.0|Arguably the best this franchise has to offer.  It is classic confilct with great characters.  Richardo Montelbann is Magnificent as Khan.  He's easily the 'single' greatest star trek villan in franchise history.  An evolution beyond most of the one dimensional villans, he adds a sophistication to the plot that most ST films don't touch.  What's more the main cast is together and in classic form.  No hamming it up in this one.  And who could forget the end: Spock's apparent ultimate sacrifice.......truely touching!  A strong four stars.
1586210912|4.0|The book brought up a lot of good theories, but they all sounded too simple.  Though the book was a quick read, it was also so repetitive that at times I got bored with reading the same thought written for fifteen pages when it should have only taken up one.  The simplicity and repetiveness helped me understand the overall picture, so I guess it is a good starting book when dealing with investments and money issues.
0780626478|5.0|I have seen this movie twice and have loved it both times. It is a funny and  endearing romantic comedy that is peppered with a terrific cast and excellent performances. I would gladly watch it again.<br />Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken), a nerdy, nutty scientist, and his traditional and very pregnant wife, Helen (Sissy Spacek),  are living in California in fifties style splendor in the early nineteen sixties, when the Cuban Missile Crisis occurs. Buying into the red scare of the day and convinced that attack by the communists is imminent, they  immediately go underground into the super deluxe bomb shelter that Calvin had had the foresight to build under his house and fully equip with enough supplies to last thirty five years. No sooner do they do so, Calvin's fears are reinforced, as suddenly a force of great impact shudders overhead. Thinking that they were hit by an atomic blast set off by the communists, they hunker down for the next thirty five years, waiting for the radiation to dissipate.<br />In the interim, they have a baby boy, whom they name Adam (Brendan Fraser). As Adam grows up, he is unknowingly caught in a time warp with his parents, as they have no contact with the outside world.  Adam's world view and values reflect that of his parents, as his entire life, thus far, has been spent underground soley in their company. When the thirty five years are up, Calvin surfaces briefly to check the state of affairs topside. What he sees, he misinterprets, and upon his return to the bomb shelter ends up having a heart attack. He and Helen then dispatch Adam on a reconnaissance mission to get needed supplies.<br />What transpires when Adam ventures into the outside world is very funny and often poignant. As played by Brendan Fraser, the thirty five year old Adam, a fresh faced, polite virgin with no fashion sense, has a Dudley-Do-Right quality and a load of goofy, sincere charm that ensures the comedic success of  this film. His foray into the outside world, his endearingly innocent interpretation of all that he sees, and his interaction with others will leave the viewer laughing. When he runs into Eve (Alicia Silverstone), the hard edged, appropriately named, beautiful blonde with a heart of gold, he is smitten. Together they will leave the viewer hoping that Adam and Eve will find the Garden of Eden.<br />Christopher Walker is wonderful as the slightly nutty, paranoid but brilliant scientist. Sissy Spacek shows a distinct comedic flair as the patient and long suffering wife who buys into her husband's vision of things. Dave Foley of \\"Kids in the Hall\\" fame is terrific as Eve's drolly funny, gay roommate. Alicia Silverstone, while ostensibly the weakest link in this otherwise brilliantly cast comedy, still manages to give a more than acceptable performance as the cynical Eve. It is Brendan Fraser, however, with his aw-shucks, innocent veneer, who deftly steals the show right under everyone's nose. His charming and funny, ingratiating performance is one that will have the viewer watching this film over and over again. This is a must have comedy for one's personal collection.his endearingly innocent interpretation of all that he sees, and his interaction with others will leave the viewer laughing.

B000089RVX|4.0|I first heard Evanescence while watching the Daredevil movie and I was like, \\"Who is that? They sound cool!\\" So I found their record on Amazon and I also got to see them at the 9:30 Club in DC. <BR>The disc is great and the band shows potential to go far. And they do have a long way to go. Too many of the songs were just teen/relationship angst. Their sound is great and Aimee's voice is really good. <BR>Live-they were good too. Interestingly enough their live show was only 45 minutes long, the exact running time of their disc. Like I said, they got a long way to go. But it was still a good show and I recommend checking them out live if you have a chance. <BR>Bottom line: Great album, great emerging band.
B00003CXFV|3.0|Summary:<BR>Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is an ex-beauty queen with three children, two ex-husbands, no job, and no job skills. The movie begins with Erin flubbing a job interview and getting in an accident. She hires Ed Masry (Albert Finney) to sue the other driver. When Ed loses the case Erin demands he give her a job. He does and when she takes a personal interest in a pro bono case that turns out to be a major civil suite, Ed and Erin push it through to victory landing a multi-million dollar settlement against Pacific Gas and Electric. Though Erin isn't a legal expert, she is a people person and it's through her efforts that the case is really won.<br />My Comments:<BR>The movie isn't particularly quick, suspenseful, or exciting, but it is remarkably well-produced. The cinematography is great; some of the scenes are even shot in Hinkley, CA, giving the movie a very authentic feel. Ed, Erin, and George (Aaron Eckhart) - the three main actors - are great and well-portrayed.<br />I felt like I was left not knowing what turns out with George, Erin's boyfriend, and there is only one scene of Erin informing people of the court's decision. Too much time was spent on Erin collecting plaintiffs in Hinkley and not enough on her relationship with George and her kids, unless, of course, she really was incredibly neglectful of her family and friends.<br />I'm doing my best to not comment on the story itself, because it is a true story, but I couldn't help but see Erin as an annoying pain. Perhaps that means Julia Roberts did a good job, nevertheless, I wouldn't mind avoiding someone as caustic as Erin was portrayed in my personal life.<br />Overall, the movie is entertaining and well done with just a few flaws. If you like Julia Roberts or legal films, you'll probably enjoy this film. Otherwise, you might find it a bit boring.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I just received this CD a few days ago and all I can say is that I'm just amazed at how good it is...I have to admit that Soundgarden is/was the band whose music upon my first listening rose to the top of my favorite band list.  The complexity and message of their music is in a category all by itself.  Now that Cornell has joined with former member of RATM, that complexity and lyricism are back.  The marriage of Cornell's singing and writing with the powerful music of RATM has combined to create a new sound that is a such a pleaure in the everyday world of FM/MTV/VH1 blah....
1586210912|4.0|I highly recommend this book readers of all ages.  It is an easy read but very informative.  It enables you to think of money in a way that is out of the ordinary.  Becuase the author learned at such a young age it motivates teenagers that their money habits today will effect their tomorow.  I am now aware of assest and liabilities and will rethink the way I spend my next pay check.  This book made me realize that to get rich one must think and introspect.  Once that is done and one is able to set aside money as well as properly invest wealth will come.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.
B000088E6M|5.0|Give this CD about 10 listens straight thru before casting final judgement. Your patience will be richly rewarded. Forget about the &quot;without Eminem, 50 cent who?&quot; The music stands squarely on it's own two feet at the top of the heap. Easily worth the fifteen bucks you should have laid down yesterday if you do not own this milestone compilation.
B000075BFK|5.0|As an avid fan of Tupac for many years, I find that this album is one of the better of his.  Although I dont think Tupac was the best lyrical talent, through his \\"Makaveli period\\" he does show dramatic improvement from his earlier things.  Tupac had many moods in his music and this shows them all.  This album will make you laugh, party, and cry.  Even though this album has music made before '96 the words still mean something today, as all Tupac's music does.  The production on this album range from mediocre to excellent.  I gave this album 5 stars because all in all this is one of Tupacs greatest albums.  Tupac says himself that he is looking for these better dayz and through his fans keeping him alive he can have them eternally.  RIP to the shining serpent we all love you!!!!

It's probably one of the best cartoon-to-live-action movies out.<br />Bottom line, just don't take it too seriously or don't too critical and enjoy yourself.

B000067J1H|5.0|First things first: You probably didn't understand this movie. David Fincher makes dark films that toss muddled characters together and Fate spins the wheel. Centrifugal force takes over. Don't get me wrong. The plot holds to logical conventions, reality may be stretched, but the otherworldiness of 'Seven', for example, [filmed] in a dreary, nameless city, doesn't overly tax credibility. In \\"Fight Club\\" the idea that Tyler and 'Jack' could spearhead a global movement of disaffected men with a penchant for thumping each other into senselessness, while a bit silly, isn't impossible to believe, given how men engage in the sorting out of the pecking order normally. Anyone who has watched 4 year old boys in a sandbox knows that aggression determines who keeps the shovel.<br />But the movie is not about the Social Learning Theory of aggressive behavior. It's about how we arrive at what is worth fighting for, about emotional connectedness, about how we integrate conflicting agenda items into our consciousness. You can say all you want about the likeability of the characters. Personally, I wouldn't trust Marla or Jack or Tyler for a minute, but each character is playing out a role that typifies a point on everyones psychological map. Jack is in Siberia, in a consumerist gulag that has him prisoner to the Ikea catalog. Marla, though plenty attractive, is so damaged by life that she wanders from one self-help meeting to another ( as does Jack ), hoping to heal her invisible psychic wounds. Tyler is a glib, self-made philosopher/soap salesman whose motives seem to be mostly iconoclastic. The perfect trio.<br />What happens in this film occurs because each character is impelled to pursue a fated role, not because he or she wants the inevitable outcome, but because each choice narrows the succeeding choices. In such a nihilist universe, love is destructive, not redeeming. I don't think this movie is enjoyable in conventional terms; it is abrupt, dangerous, eccentric as well as ironic and a little creepy. Given that caveat, it succeeds as entertainment because it doesn't try to entertain.
B000084T18|4.0|What are people complaining about? Saying 50 is fake. Well he isn't, but even if he was I still don't see why you would complain considering that pretty much all mainstream rap is utter.. .... It's about time someone like 50 comes in; and thank god he takes shots at posers like Ja Rule and their horrible manufactured lyrics and ryhming. 50 definently isn't the best rapper as he claims, but he sure as hell can compete with the best of them. Also, his unique voice definently brings some fresh air to the rap game. As for the beats, they are tight as hell for the most part, except for a few songs like P.I.M.P which feel way out of place. <br />Get Rich is not a perfect album by any means, but it is a breathe of fresh air from all of the ...-rap we hear on the radio these days.
B000001DTM|5.0|We/ve come a long long way from 'Boy', down political alleys, thru the streets of rock iconhood, thru spiritual gateways, to 'Achtung Baby', the star in the crown for this Irish band. After 'Joshua Tree' swept up such widespread acclaim, it was hard to forecast the artistic direction change that 'Achtung' would represent, yet with production by such a groundbreakers as Daniel Lanois with help from Brian Eno, it comes as no surprise that much of the music on the seventh full length studio release by U2 is dramatically different from what has come before. <br />Caked in layers of industrial sludge, yet steaming fresh, Zoo Station begins the procession of swirling guitar licks and taut drum beats that have characterized U2. To the American ear, the lyric is vague on its references , but I like \\"Time is a train/Makes the future the past/Leaves you standing in the station/Your face pressed up against the glass.\\" <br />The guitar intro to One is sublime. Bono's mildly raspy voice is clear and full of anguish. The song is a plea: \\"Sisters, Brothers...one life, with each other/We're one, but we're not the same.\\" The song is a crescendo unto itself.<br />There are so many amazing tunes on this album, from the apocalyptic Waiting til the End of the World to The Fly, each creating its own sonic atmosphere, each bearing the U2 imprint, but stretching the band and the listener alike. This music is so good, it looks like U2 spent its ammo in one burst, since the releases from 'Achtung' to 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' are pale renditions. Fly on, U2.
0553277472|5.0|Had heard abt this book, back in college..somehow slipped my thought for a while. Bumped into this on the shelfs of B&amp;N, picked it up without a second thought... <BR>The way  the author has dealt with some fundamental aspects of life, its very insightful...definitely not a philosophical take on life..but the mundane things that we see and do in our lifes are dealt with in amazing clarity. Did it change my life? hard to say, but i did bookmark a lot of pages..for future reference. A must read, and definitely worth a re-read.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Reduced to simplest terms, Wilco, the brainchild of Jeff Tweedy, has embarked on a tour of our You-Knighted States as it wallows in the beginnings of a new decade. \\"I Am Trying...\\" appears to be about a relationship made fragile by tension and uncertainty, but a line here and there could easily refer to a terrorist. Not knowing when the song was written, I can only guess at Tweedy's antecedents. \\"Kamera\\" treats the themes of internal and external vision, how we see and are seen, and the tag line \\"No, it's not OK\\" tells us, as does the spelling of the title, that we don't see as clearly as we imagine. The sweet string intro to \\"Jesus, etc.\\" belies the dark poignancy of the lyric: \\"Bitter melodies turning your orbit around.\\" I especially like the parallel images of stars as setting suns and lovers as burning suns. \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" is a perfect deception, a song about illusion and loss, masquerading as a calliope theme. In the final analysis, Wilco has crafted a marvelous assembly of tunes, bright and dark, light and heavy, poured out for us to drench ourselves in.
B000068PQ0|5.0|As an avid follower of the jam-band scene (Widespread Panic, Phish, moe., etc.), I was reluctant to buy \\"Yoshimi Battles Pink Robots\\" by the Flaming Lips. I was under the assumption that the Lips were a pop band with no substance. I soon found out though, that this may be the most creative band on the planet.<br />Many people recommended this album to me, so I finally went out and bought it. I immediately fell in love with the brilliant compositions and unique songwriting. This album is a sonic journey of the imagination, and each time I hear it, I discover more sounds that I had previously not heard. To be honest, this album will scramble your brain. \\"Yoshimi\\" is a hallucinogenic drug in itself, and should be listened to with caution. It is hands down one of the best albums I've ever heard. Buy it...immediately.
0345298349|5.0|Near the end of Chapter 11, Renko experiences a sharp pang of discomfort as the girl he has entangled in his investigation of three murders puts a cigarette out against the bark of a birch tree, &quot;as if the warm stab were being pressed into his heart. He believed her. The truth had gone from her into the tree and into him.&quot; This is the quality of writing that we get from Martin Cruz Smith. His facility with language balances with his storycraft to produce a compelling, dramatic espionage thriller that stands against the best work of Le Carre or Fredrick Forsyth.
0790729369|5.0|Quite possibly the best movie ever made.
B00000I8UF|5.0|Too many musicians of vision and great skill have died in their prime. Brownie, Booker Little, Bird. But to me, the greatest loss was Lee Morgan. He may have been in the middle of a spiral into mediocrity at the time of his death, but on 'Moanin' and 'The Big Beat', the next album by the Jazz Messengers, his gutsy, masculine lyricism and musical pyrotechnics reach their apex. On Along Came Betty, the graceful, insinuating walk of this woman lilts on the round melodic tone of Morgan's horn. Though firmly in the hard bop tradition, Lee Morgan can rhapsodize with the very best. As Leonard Feather observes in the album cover notes, Morgan's wit is apparent in the manner he ends the first two choruses of his solo, but I think Morgan is remembering Betty (or some other lady) with knowing wisdom. This Betty will get the best of anyone who crosses her path. 'Moanin' is the album that established Art Blakey as the premier band leader of the Blue Note label. No jazz collection is complete without it.

I was fortunate enough to obtain an advance copy, and I can honestly say: anyone with a TV should get this DVD. Also, a DVD player.<br />I've watched \\"Roger Rabbit\\" over and over again on VHS, but I can tell you this: watching the Vista Series Edition was like seeing a whole new movie. The widescreen presentation (enhanced for 16x9 televisions) perfectly showcases the movie's incredible special effects. The razor-sharp image makes the interaction between live-action and animated characters seamless, and you find yourself sucked even deeper \\"into Toontown\\" than ever before.<br />The DVD packaging is also top-notch. The Vista Series Edition is made for serious movie fans, and the packaging (with its holo-foil cover and cool \\"leather-notebook\\" interior design) makes this DVD a real premium item.<br />There are two discs, just packed with goodies. You'll watch the bonus material as often as you watch the actual movie--I certainly have!<br />Run, don't walk, to buy a copy of \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\\" Or better yet, just stay here and click \\"Add to Shopping Cart.\\" But make sure you're getting the Vista Series Edition!
B00000JGHM|3.0|I am a big fan of Michael Mann. In Manhunter, he took his Miami Vice palette and painted a psychological thriller the equal of some of Hitchcock's work, not in the same style, of course, but with the tension and nuance of the master. Here, he is stuck with phenomenal stars, Pacino and De Niro, and they don't pull off the heist, that is, they don't \\"steal the show\\" or even work well together. The result is a crime drama that has more glitz than excitement, more form than substance.<br />I didn't care one whit about any character in this film, except Pacino's wife, and I can't figure out why she would stick it out for ten weeks with this guy, let alone ten years.<br />Val Kilmer is the doomed partner of De Niro, and at least he is so [weak] that you have some grudging sympathy for him, but in the end he's just another thief who gets his due.<br />I can't say this is a bad film, just not a particularly good one, especially in light of the resources at Mann's disposal.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Benny and Joon was a light-hearted story of two misfits in a world that doesn't quite accept them. I think we all feel like that at times. I love how innocent the relationship stayed between them. It really kept the movie on a higher level. What woman wouldn't want to be romanced the way Jonny Depp's character did for June?<br />This movie is a definite keeper for the collector!
B00000JHAU|5.0|5.4 million people, more if you count Sean Connery, ( I don't, but that's a whole nuther story, mate ) and look what the Scots done to music. I'm not talking about the bagpipe thing, though &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; on pipes is pretty scary the first time, isn't it?<br />I'm talking about Cocteau Twins, The Beta Band, Jesus and Mary Chain, Del Amitri, and Belle and Sebastian. It's a heavy burden to be a sublimely clever soft rock band in the 20th Century. No flippin' market for it, for starters, but worse, you have to write songs. None of this three chord business, with crashing drums and tons of feedback. No. And then there are the rhymes. I'm thinking of 'Fox in the Snow'. If you're looking for songs that have those nice moon/June rhymes, you're plumb out of luck. All you've got here is a fresh melody, an ironic storyline, some fine guitar picking, rich string backing, and a vocal that lets you understand all the words. Rather than go thru all the songs -- you can do that yourselves -- I'll point out that there are no bad apples here. Just peaches, the kind you like, Brad and Daphne, if those are your names.<br />Belle and Sebastian has carved out a very small niche, but they know what they are doing better than any other band I can think of, and they are undetered from pursuing their ideal of artistic integrity. I give this release 4.5 stars.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is the most refreshing music I have heard in a long time. The girl knows blues in the most fundamental way. If you've had a rough day or week and need something to relax you try this CD. I didn't find a song I didn't like on it. Of course I had my preferences. The title song is the kind of song that takes you on a trip beyond reality. <br />If you have been arguing with your spouse and just not getting along, listen to this CD together... it just might be the salve that heals your relationship;-)
B000067CPX|5.0|Ok, I admit it. I'm too old for this: a scribe for kids born during the war ( WWII ) who listen to eclectic music. I have some qualifications for this. Saw Hendrix and Cream 4X each. So bleepin' what? Only that popular culture appeals to a vast range of tastes, and old folk can be set straight by youngsters, when the tykes in question are RHCP. <BR>'By the Way' is my second foray into Chili Peppers' music. I own 'Blood/Sugar' but it fails to draw me to it, not because of the lack of musicianship or bad song writing, more because I am not a funk/punk/metal fan of any real measure. I bought 'Blood/Sugar 'cuz I heard it was good. No comment. But 'By the Way' is a work of art, well conceived and well realized. <BR>Title track is two, two, two songs in one: a funk-rap and a delicate, introspective, wistful ditty that celebrates its pop roots. The line &quot;Dani the girl/is singing songs to me/under the marquee...of her soul&quot; is achy-tender. It knocks me out.<BR>'Zephyr' sails on a silky guitar, a breeze that curls into the corner of your heart. You can hear how much John Frusciante has listened to the Beach Boys throughout this album, the harmonies abounding with airy grace. I loved this disc thru and thru.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is one of the strangest and creepiest films I've seen, but it is also one of the best.  This is one of those films that you have to talk about after seeing it, because it is so open for interpretation.  If you like strange, disturbing movies with shocking plot twists, then you will love this film.  On the surface the film makes little sense, but if you just look into the clues then the story becomes clear, like one of those \\"Magic Eye\\" 3D illusions.  This is one of those films you have to pay close attention to, because the director uses symbolism, color, and strange characters to unravel its mysteries.  Don't pay attention to other critics who can't figure the movie out--they just don't appreciate a macabre mystery like this.  It is one of the most talked about movies in the last 10 years, and has won over a dozen film awards as well as being Oscar nominated.  This is the best film by David Lynch, one of the most original  directors of our time.  He is the master of blending fantasy and reality until the lines of dreams and consciousness are blurred.
B000000Y2F|5.0|In the Fifties, jazz artists like John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk were among a handful of musicians who shaped the future of modern American music for several decades.  The fact that they played together and that their sessions at The Five Spot Cafe were recorded is nearly a miracle, since they were under contract to different record labels.  They both appear on another record ( Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants- Prestige LP 7150 ), but they don't play together!  So this disc is the sole representation of their musical collaboration.<br />Ruby My Dear shows the young 'Trane playing mostly in the upper register of his tenor sax, with much vibrato, punctuating the sentiment in the tune.  We can hear instantly the facility with which he deals with Monk's harmonic structure in this poignant ballad.  Ironic piano solos are commonplace for Monk, but here he is more straighforward, with a half chorus that veers away from the polysyllabic phrasing of 'Trane's tenor.  Monk's comping under Coltrane's restatement of the melody is  unobtrusively perfect!<br />On Nutty, Monk's solo echos lines that 'Trane has drawn, showing that the conversation between sax and piano is between equals.  The high point of this disc is that Monk and 'Trane clearly speak each other's musical language.  Over and over, you can hear the attention they pay to the phrasing of one another, such that they complement rather than compete.<br />Two of the tunes add several other horns, including Coleman Hawkins, who gives forth with a taut chorus on Off Minor.  The drummer here is Art Blakey, whose touch is very different from Shadow Wilson, more cymbal oriented, except for the characteristic press rolls that add exclamation points to solos.<br />The disc ends with an unaccompanied piano solo -- Functional -- by Monk. It's very sad that there isn't a cellar in Lower Manhattan with a box of tape from other Five Spot session waiting to be discovered.  This is the sort of music I never tire of hearing.
B000002H6C|5.0|This album is worth 5 start JUST for the song 'One'. In my oppinion (as with many internet polls) this is the best heavy metal song ever cocieved!! The climax is awesome!! Crank this 'one' up and you wont be disappionted!
6305327084|5.0|I really prefer the big screen, and I've purchased few DVDs but I bought Beautiful Girls because it's the kind of movie that stands up to multiple viewings.  The reasons are simple:  the conflicts in the story -- and there are several -- are complex and don't resolve easily or completely; the cast is very good, with Mira Sorvino and Natalie Portman shining as Beautiful Girls who have yet to be fully discovered; the pace is crisp and the dialog is not overwritten ( the clever parts are not self-consciously so ); and again, there's Natalie Portman.<br />I find it difficult to imagine that she will ever surpass this performance.  Marty was written for a bright and alluring girl of around 13, who, in her own words, has &quot;an old soul&quot;.  She is more than a match for the drifting pianist, Will, whose girlfriend is rated &quot;seven and a half&quot;, in a revelatory scene where three nearly grown up highschool buddies give girls they know points for looks, personality, and other qualities.<br />Matt Dillon shows himself to have some range as Mira Sorvino's husband, carrying on an affair with his highschool sweetheart, played shamelessly by Lauren Holly.  Uma Thurman has a small but pivotal role as the sister of a local tavernmaster, but I've never seen her as particularly captivating, so all the fuss is lost on me.<br />What rings truest in this film is that the small town folks portrayed are real, dealing with life as it comes, and they grab at your sensibilities, carrying a poignant message, full of the grit that comes from their authenticity.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Just in case you didnt know, this album was on Rolling Stone best of 90s (1 of 10 or so albums)! It IS Pearl Jam's best album... Just thought you should know...
0064409422|4.0|I think that, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was a pretty good book.  I really think that everybody should read this book.  I chose it because it looked interresting so I picked it.  My favorite part was when Lucy first saw Narnia.  I think that people who like imaginary things and places should read this book!  My favorite character was Lucy, she was brave and she never got scared of anything!  So all of you out there should read this very good book
B000002H6C|5.0|WOW! I cannot believe how good the song 'ONE' is! Just listen to this song every day and you'll know what i mean. the rest of the album is awesome... blackened is probably the next best, everything else is awesome! I repeat, 'One' is the best song ever!
0141301155|5.0|I think that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a very good book. Why? Well Because it`s almost every childs dream to walk into Willy Wonka`s Chocolate Factory or any Chocolate factory in that case. Get to try all the candy`s for free and  before there even out in the store`s to be sold! I belive that this book is a very good book for all ages. It`s a fun book to read.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Classic. Also very, very underrated. Hail Hail, Lukin, Smile, Off He Goes, In My Tree, Red Mosquito are all excellent songs. Very solid, it's pretty hard to flaw this album so just disregard the 1 star reviews as complete bs.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember was the best book i've ever read.  I could not put It down.  The book was about a preacher's daughter named Jamie Sullivan, and an over-the-edge boy named Landon Carter ,who likes to get in trouble,but dosen't try to.  One day, he meets Jamie, and begins to become a nice caring boy, and falls in love with Jamie.  When he finds out that Jamie is very ill, he will do anything to make her dreams come true.
0064407667|3.0|If I were to describe \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" in one word it would be- depressing.  Yet what more can one expect from the first book in \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events.\\"  The story begins with the Baudelaire children playing on the beach on a seemingly nice day.  The mood of the day changes quickly as the children receive news that their parents have been killed in a fire that destroyed their entire home.  The children are then sent to live with the man who is in charge of their estate.  Their luck goes from bad to worse when they are sent to live with Count Olaf, a distant relative the children have never heard of.<BR>The Baudelaire orphans are resourceful children, each with special talents and gifts.  Violet is the oldest child and has a knack for inventing and building odd devices.  One can tell when Violet is developing a new invention in her head by her pulled back hair and furrowed brow.  Klaus is the middle child and incredibly intelligent.  He loves to read and would spend hours in his families' library learning about everything from Julius Caesar to the organisms found at Briny Beach.  Sunny is the youngest Baudelaire child and simply put she likes to bite things.  One of the most enjoyable parts of Sunny's personality is the way in which she speaks to her brother and sister.  They understand each other in a way that is both sweet and memorable.  The author does a wonderful job of developing the character of each of these children.  To the point that the reader is able to identify with the pain each must feel as the events of the story unfold.<BR> The children's relationship with their guardian, Count Olaf, is a poor one due to his evil nature.  Count Olaf is only interested in taking hold of the children's fortune and does not care for their welfare.  The treatment these children receive by Count Olaf is contrasted nicely by the joy they light up with upon even the mention of Justice Strauss.  She is a kindly neighbor whose assistance brightens the otherwisedark days the children experience.  Also, while the author hints at a happy ending just a few pages before the end, there is no such hope.  This book is as dark and grim as its title suggests.  <BR> Many middle school children, along with everyone else in America, are enthralled in the Harry Potter series.  The books have been compared by many readers because of the dark mood they share but \\"The Bad Beginning\\" lacks the morals found in the Harry Potter books.  Lemony Snickett makes no attempt to fashion characters that are overtly honorable or intentional role models.  Instead he seems to focus on fashioning a story that is far beyond any experience the average middle school child might face.  The depressing nature of the book makes it unlike the books many teachers would recommend for the students.  It is also unlike the books that many parents will remember reading when they were in middle school.  <BR>The highlight of this book in my opinion is that it does offer an alternative to the fairy tales normally written for middle school children.  Life is not full of happy endings and prince charmings and this book makes that extremely clear.  \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" is a refreshing alternative to the typical young adult novel focused on pre-teen girls and their issues with boys and their parents.  While the above elements make for an enjoyable story this book lacks the high morals and realistic experiences that I look for in books my children will be reading.  In conclusion, I would recommend this book to those who are looking for a light, intriguing read.  I would not however recommend it to anyone who is looking for a story containing strong characters of high morals that their children can identify with.
185984054X|5.0|My friend has first hand experience with 'missionaries of charity' in India and speaks lot more horrible stories, may be worse than Nazi camps.  What Christopher Hitchens reveals is just a tip of the iceberg about \\"real\\" mother teresa.  She is a hardcore missionary and has no concern for humanity, (though she and Indian media projects a totally different picture).  Do you know that sister Nirmala (personally chosen by Mother Teresa to head the missionaries of charity) was recently (in 2002) fined by Indian court?  do you know her offence?  She burnt a 6 year old girl's hands with  a red hot rod .  WOW!  What a symbol of humanity?  The little orphan girl's offence.  THE LITTLE GIRL FELT HUNGY AND ATE A PIECE OF BREAD.   These people speak of LOVE, AFFECTION, CARING and HUMANITY.   It is a simple publicity exercise.
B000068IEU|4.0|This definitely isn't a movie for everyone. It is a bit old-fashioned and dated, which I personally like but some audiences of today probably wouldn't. Also it is VERY disturbing and unflinching, I saw it for the first time a few days ago and I still can't get it out of my head. This is the kind of horror film that actually scares me, because I find real people and things that actually happen so much scarier than ghosts and made up monsters. I LOVE that it's so low budget and grainy; like Texas Chainsaw Massacre it lends the film a documentary feel which adds to the tension. I actually wish horror films were still made like this, and no, Blair Witch doesn't count. I like the ironic use of happy hillbilly music and beautiful sun-filled woods that are at direct contrast to the stark horror happening within. The acting in this movie ranges from good (the 2 girls, the head psycho David Hess) to ok (the parents) to really bad (the cops). I felt that the &quot;comedy relief&quot; of the 2 dumb cops was out of place and not needed at all. The extras here are great, the only one I didn't care for was the soundless, dull outtakes &amp; dailies. If you are interested in this film and others like it, you should also check out the documentary AMERICAN NIGHTMARE which looks at the history of independent horror films and how they are influenced by modern world events. At one point they talk specifically of this film; it's very informative and fascinating, definitely worth watching.
B000089RVX|5.0|I was reading all of the reviews and everyone of them rated them highly.  I just wanted to also add a quick review to say this is the best album I have heard in a long time.  This album appeals to many different types of fans.  The music is great, lyrics are moving and Amy Lee's voice is enchanting.  I just hope they tour in NYC soon!
B00007E8V4|5.0|People who reviewed this album seemed to focus on the songs on it, rating them and whatnot. I think this is a faulty approach. While there are songs that stand out because of harshness, or a particularly catchy chorus, you really can't just buy a system album, in my opinion, because of a certain song. This is pretty hypocritic, because I do have my favorite system songs, but I think listening to a system album is just such an experience, from the beginning to the end, that if you just pick it apart song by song, it makes it lose it's power, it's vitality. Steal this album sounds by far like the most mature of the 3 system albums, all the different instruments (sitars, violins, etc.) just add to the middle eastern flavor, system really seems to come across with what they want to say. The political lyrics are something the critics can write about, I feel that while they are important, you really can't label this masterpiece a \\"political album\\", just because the band members feel compelled to write about the world around them. There are hard songs and there are softer, more mellow songs on this album, all of them sound great together, if you listen to the album from beginning to end, you can hardly spot where one song begins and the other ends. Wether this is good or not, decide for yourself. The band focuses a lot on the melodies now, almost all of the songs have a beautiful, catchy part in them that makes you instantly fall in love with it. That's it for now.
0792846443|4.0|Just released as an MGM Special Edition DVD in Region 2 only.  A very sharp picture transfer on this edition, and some great features including interviews with stars and production crew, as well as audio commentaries (if you go for that).<br />Misery is a fine film with the right ingredients to make it a true suspense thriller.  Kathy Bates shines as the looney devoted fan of author Paul Sheldon (played superbly by James Caan) who happens to rescue him from a car crash and keeps him prisoner.  Nail biting stuff especially when it looks like he'll never escape her clutches.<br />Great to finally see this film getting the DVD transfer it deserves ie. special edition!  Avoid earlier DVD versions with poor film quality.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I was born in 1963, so I grew up listening to all those 70's mega produced folky guys like Gordon Lightfoot, Jimmy Webb's (Wichita Lineman)...etc.. Beck nailed that sound. Not easy to do or sell. However, the first 6 songs are some of the most beautiful I have ever heard. Produced by Nigel Godrich (OK Computer). That fact alone warrants at least one listen.....with really good headphones and some pot.
0609610570|1.0|I was very disappointed by this book. It was more of the same drivel that Ram Charan has been expounding on for the past few years. It completely ignores the fact that unless one knows where one is going, execution is useless. Ram is a consultant to CEOs and speaking for someone who works at a company whose CEO has been hypnotized by Ram, and seeing the results (stock price at rock bottom, cash problems, no vision, treating employees like dirt), I can safely say: SAVE YOUR MONEY - don't buy this book. It is more snake oil from one of the greatest snake oil salesmen to come along in recent times.
0060278250|5.0|Lirael, a daughter of the Clayr (a group of people who have the power to see the future), and Sameth, the prince of a magical world known as the Old Kingdom, continue their journey that was begun in the prequel, Lirael.  Lirael has aceepted the position of Abhorsen-in-waiting, which means that when the current Abhorsen dies she will become the one who must make sure the dead stay dead.  Sameth is on a journey to find his friend Nicholas, who doesn't believe in the magic of the Old Kingdom and is incredibly vulnerable to it.  Along with their two mysterious and powerful companions, Mogget (the unwilling servant of the Abhorsen) and the Disreputable Dog (Lirael's best friend, made up of a balance of restrained and free magic), they must set out to find the young prince's lost parents (the King and Abhorsen) and his friend Nicholas on a jumbled vision seen by the Clayr. Truly an astounding book that I would recommend to anyone.
B000058983|5.0|This is a wonderful remastering of a great rock classic. I would give this the edge over any Beatles CD, and it is certainly one of the top albums every created. The production is wonderful and the string and brass arrangement sound the most natural (integrated into the sound) of any recordings of this period where most orchestrations (including the Beatles) sound like uncomfortable add-ons.<br />Try it, listen to it several times to let it sink in, you'll Love it Forever.
1573229725|5.0|I could not put this book down. Once I got to know the characters, I was turning pages fast as I could. Mystery,<br />drama, romance... everything- and then some.<br />BUT NOT written like the normal book out there.  This book<br />is a one of a kind experience.<br />I highly recommend it- it was a one day read for me, because I am a fast reader, and it is a page turner. It is a large book<br />though- I would guess a good weekend book. Wonderful for a rainy<br />day!
B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles are the band that define music. Their style, their lyrics, their songs, and their influence. However, if you weren't alive when the greatest band ever released Srgt. Pepper's Lonley Heartsclub Band, then it's nearly impossible to imagine what kind of an impact they had on the entire world, and how different the world is because of this record. This album didn't just influence music, but it made the world a different place. Just about everyone and everything has been influenced by the Beatles, from politics to school, athletics to movies, and influenced every kind of music imaginelable. The world would be an entirely different place without this record, and without the Beatles. Buy this album to fully appreciate the world.
B0000542DJ|1.0|The movie \\"JFK\\" was described by the most trusted man in America Walter Cronkite as \\"a tissue of lies\\". Director Oliver Stone now calls this film \\"an alternative myth\\" such is the misinformation and inaccuracies in this movie. The line \\"let the truth be known or the Heavens fall\\" is from a Hollywood writer and was never stated. In actual fact,Garrison wasn't even at the courts at the time of the court's decision. He was in his office at the time. Indeed,there is little truth in this film as a lot of the witnesses and their fates were made up for this fictional movie.

B00008977N|5.0|Peter Gabriel is the type of performer that takes his time and does things right.  This DVD is no exception. The sound is second to none, especially if you have a good surround sound system and listen to the dvd in dolby digital 5.1.  This is more than just a live concert, it is a piece of art more along the lines of a broadway show.  There is a cast of characters on stage and each one of them is able to showcase their talent.  A perfect example of a supporting player on the dvd who at times steals the performance away from Peter Gabriel is that of Paula Cole.  She has tremendous range and is a pleasure to listen to.  Anyone who enjoys the music of Peter Gabriel will surely enjoy this dvd.
B000002RJN|5.0|Lucky for me, my older brother was a Byrds fan.   While listening to his Byrds collection I began to take note of the gentlemen singing lead on a number of early Byrd songs who had a beautifully sad mournful voice. It was Gene Clark.  From that moment on I began following his career right up to his untimely passing in 1991.  &quot;No Other&quot; is simply stunning. It has a folk foundation that is surrounded by surreal orchestration which is brought home by Gene's sensitive vocals.  &quot;Lifes Greatest Fool&quot; and &quot;The True One&quot; are beautiful while &quot;Lady of the North&quot; is breathtaking. &quot;Some Misunderstanding&quot; still delightfully challengers the listener. There is not a weak track on this CD.  I wore out my LP long ago. If it were possible to wear out a CD, I would have done so already.  I simply love these songs. This is a great set from a true music pioneer.  Gene was indeed the &quot;True One&quot;.

B000002NC4|5.0|After a long stint listening to Ska my camp counseler Dylan reccomended this album to me among others. After listening to the guitars, the unique blend of rhythms, the incredible lyrics, and beats that would make my drummer cry, I was sold. This album is for anyone who appreciates the subtleties in music, and the true expressive quality of true indie rock. What more is there to say, this album is excellent.
0446677450|4.0|the aurther takes a stroll down in reaveling the secret of money making it is piece of book. i was just a freshman studying Economics/Political Science in UNN when i got hold of the book. but by the time i could finish the introductory pages of the book, i became scared of dropping out of undergraduate school, thank God i am already out of High school because of my state of mind; since the question was not just education alone but rather, which one first, money or school. considering the fact that money wasnt thought in school only skills and professions are thought in colleges.<br />sincerely, it was a controversial issue for me to decide what i really wanted in life, but as i begin to unenvelope the said book, my insights and by the time i finished the first chapter of the book, i say almost all the reasons i needed to make a choice of want in life. it became real to me why i should embrace both choices simultaneously.<br />the book has eventually changed and transformed me for the better, it has opened my awareness into wealth and foresight to richness. it has expanded all my motives in life, my hopes and aspiration in wealth making rather than paying more taxes after school. you too can read it and grow bigger and better, infact Richard was lucky to have a rich and a poor father oh! how i wished i was like him having such fathers and the need to critique there advises instead of merely going to school for education sake, you can as well get rich by just reading a book. what a chance! well if you havent seen the book, then you havent seen anyhing yet and i mean it. This is Reality Beyond The Limits of Perspection; an Extraordinary Intellectual Energy for those who desire to get rich even without going to high school. think of Bill Gate (a drop out) Richard said it all.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I don't understand all the backlash about this girl being corporate. She has a set of pipes like I haven't heard in years. Combined with the fact that she's writing her own tunes and she's only 22, I'm looking forward to her career. This album is by far one of the best debut's to come along. No disappointment here.
0446677450|4.0|Mr. Kiyosaki writes about being willing to take risks to become rich. That the common person will often have and miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime because of that fear. The fear of knowing you won't be secure.  The book is very interesting especially for young adults who still have the ability to take chances and be able to recuperate from any of them quickly.  The book does a good job of giving the reader an overview of what it takes to be rich.  The steps seem too simple to be true.  I learned the difference betwwen an asset and a liability, which according to Kiyosaki is an important step in making the write decisions to becoming rich and most importantly staying rich.
031286504X|5.0|One of the best horror books I have ever read. A book that really lived up to the critical acclaim given to it by a generation of writers.<br />I have few books that I like so much that I keep a copy always a re read sections of them that live on in my mind. This is one such book.<br />I don't normally like vampire stories, but this is fresh and original twist on a theme that has been so done to death.
B00008RH3L|4.0|For those unfamiliar with Miller's Crossing, it is a true masterpiece that has dwelt largely in obscurity since its release in the early nineties. When asked for the Coen brother's greatest achievement, the kneejerk reaction is for the masses to yell \\"Fargo\\" while a small group whispers \\"Miller's Crossing\\". This is for two reasons: one, no one wants to knock Fargo, a great film that brought the Coens to the forefront. Second, it is almost like having knowledge of a terrific secret. No one would believe you anyway, and you feel pretty smart about it.<br />Three things stand out to me about MC: 1. Gabriel Byrne. This holds par with his performance in \\"The Usual Suspects\\" -- which is good, he is in about 90% of the movie. 2. John Turturro. Hell, what isn't this guy great in? A Coen regular, his Bernie is outstanding. 3. Imagery. I won't give a single thing away, except this: just think about hats during the movie. Hats.<br />The cat is truly out of the bag when MC is released on DVD, but that's OK. Those who know what I mean will only smile and nod. Those who don't, well, I only wish I could see this again for the first time. As Johnny said in the movie, \\"You never say 'I told you so.'\\"<br />Please enjoy this great mob flick.
0345404475|3.0|If you have seen Blade Runner don't worry about it spoiling the ending, completely different messages.  Everything of Dick's I have read have been wild, inventive, and extremely interesting.  I would recomend trying to completely forget Blade Runner (or vice versa) while reading this book, only the names and a few constructions are the same.  I actually preferred Blade Runner's main theme, but if you are into sci-fi, you absolutely must read something by Philip K. Dick (Scanner Darkly, Ubik, Three Stigmata of Palmer Elderich, for instance) if you have not already.
0694003611|1.0|I hate to pick on such a revered classic but IMO this is a really stupid book.  \\"Goodnight mush, goodnight old lady (really a rabbit) saying hush.\\" <br />The back flap says it has lulled children to sleep for generations.  Can't see why you'd want a book to do that.  I gave it a try after receiving two copies as gifts.  My daughter who loves books will see me bring it out, put her face in the couch and wail.  I think that says it all.
B0000028WD|4.0|In my humble opinion, Bob Dylan has always been a much better songwriter than a performer and his performances here are good examples of a bad night for Bob. But what makes this collection so good are the classic interpretations of his songs by really great artists, included here, that you won't hear anywhere else. Clapton's version of Don't Think Twice, It's All Right is absolutely amazing. It is definitely the way that song was meant to be done. Another classic moment is Eddie Vedder and Mike McCready's version of Masters of War. Vedder brings out the anger Bob must have been feeling when he wrote it. Of course, Chrissie Hynde, Johnny Winter and Tom Petty are amazing too. Well worth the price of admission.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I saw Norah Jones on the Amazing David Letterman show about 8 or 9 months ago.  I ran right out and bought her CD.  I left the first somewhere and went out and bought another.  This is one of the very best cd's I've ever purchased.  In fact, as I listen to each of the songs over and over again, I see a hit in each one.  What a wonderful example she is to her awards.
B00000IP4H|5.0|When I first popped this CD in and heard the lead-in countdown of \\"10, 9, 8, 7, 6...6...6...\\" followed by the most ear-bleeding G-minor power riff in heavy metal and the arachnid like drum licks from Gene Hoglan, I began to get excited. Moments later, the otherwise melodic voice of Chuck Billy emitted a gutural shout akin to Linda Blair in \\"The Excorcist\\" and then snarled at me vehemently, \\"Youtook my hand and sympathize...\\" I began to feel uneasy...like I sold my soul to satan for [money amount]. The rest I don't remember, however, as I began swirling my head and moshing around loving every moment of it!! <BR> <BR>This follow-up to \\"LOW\\" truly lives up to its name - DEMONIC. Throughout 90% of this entire CD, Chuck Billy is literally barking the lyrics of rage and damnation while Peterson and Murphy strangle their respective guitars churning out some of the most intense and brutal grindcore riffs and solos known to man. This CD is blistering and loud - something that has been missing from much of Testament's \\"LOW\\" (sans \\"Dog Faced Gods\\") and \\"The Ritual\\" offerings. Highlights of this CD are the lead in track \\"Demonic Refusal\\", \\"The Burning Times\\", \\"John Doe\\" and \\"Hatred's Rise\\". With these 4 accompanied by the other strong and intense tracks, it'll be a tough job for Testament to outdo themselves. Excellent CD! Well worth the whiplash!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|An amazingly strong debut album for Audioslave. Being a fan of Soundgarden and RATM for over 10 years now, I wasn't sure of what to make of the formation of Audioslave but the second I heard &quot;Exploder&quot; I knew I would love this album.<BR>The instrumentals are awesome, the guys from RATM aren't just rehashing the sound they had established previously, they've brought a fresh, energetic style and have taken the chance to play some more melodious tracks than they did as RATM. A great example is &quot;Light My Way&quot;, a really haunting but raw kind of rock song.<BR>Chris' singing is standout; he has lost none of the vigour he had with Soundgarden (personification of a rock god on &quot;Exploder&quot;) but is still capable of shining on softer tracks, such as &quot;Like A Stone&quot;.<BR>This is a standout effort of great instrumentals, a great vocalist, great lyrics and great range. Audioslave remind me of early Soundgarden in that they've produced seriously raw, vehement rock without sounding like the recent slew of 'nu-metal'. Don't hesitate in buying this album!
B00000K31Q|5.0|This is a great movie. It doesnot have the same story line as other teen flics, like most of them do. This is because it is a modernized version of Shakespear's &quot;Taming of The Shrew.&quot; I never get tired of it. Most movies these days are ok, but you wouldn't see twice, ya know. This movie isn't like that I could watch it over and over and never get tired of it. And even if you don't like the movie, you chics out there can stare at Heath Ledger the whole movie, cause he is SOOOOOOO HOT!
B000002IOW|4.0|Presto doesn't sound like the other Rush albums. It's still three guys from Canada being loud and playing well --- still a progressive rock band in every sense. But Presto has some kind of underlying theme that is easy to hear but hard to describe. The lyrics are very good; this is probably the single best set of lyrics written by Neil Peart.<br />The only thing that stops me from listening to this CD over and over is the bad production. It's just too quiet. Put it in a multiple disc-changer with any other rock album, and you'll see (or hear) what I mean. It's like you turned the volume WAY down every time a Presto song plays. It needs to be remastered. If it is, it will be tied with Grace Under Pressure and Moving Pictures for the title of \\"Best Rush Album Ever.\\"
B000003S0I|5.0|Guitarist Robert Fripp says goodbye to the &quot;Islands&quot; lineup of King Crimson, and finally gets himself a Crimson clan that can endure for more than one album (they would ultimately make three). With new members John Wetton on bass &amp; vocals, Bill Bruford on drums (recently departed from Yes), David Cross on violin and Jamie Muir on percussion, this edition of King Crimson roared to life in a big way with 1973's &quot;Larks' Tongues In Aspic,&quot; an enduring Crimson classic to this day. As the masterful musicians that they are, Fripp &amp; company deliver a solid platter of prog-rock that's both beautiful &amp; powerful. The band members' chemistry together is incredible, and Wetton does an excellent job on lead vocals.The mood is set right away with the 13-minute &quot;Larks' Tongues In Aspic Part I,&quot; with it's haunting, simple intro of chiming musical toyboxes (if that's what they are), before the band comes crashing in with full force. It's an amazing piece. In contrast to this epic is &quot;Book Of Saturdays,&quot; the simplest tune on the disc, featuring just Wetton and a guitar. Some Crimheads don't care for it, but I've always found it to be a lovely little song. Next is the dreamy, breathtaking &quot;Exiles,&quot; one of my personal favorite Crimson numbers. &quot;Easy Money&quot; is a classic rocker, and funky with a capital F. &quot;The Talking Drum&quot; is a startling piece, with great percussive work from Bruford, and Wetton on bass. And finally, the band head for home with the brilliant &quot;Larks' Tongues In Aspic Part II,&quot; a Crimson concert staple featuring some scorching guitarwork from Fripp. &quot;Larks' Tongues In Aspic&quot; is one of King Crimson's finest albums. From start to finish it is a terrific work. If you love progressive rock, this is a must-own. :-)

B00003CXA6|5.0|This is one excellent movie which takes the time to develope and show the true drama of what was a turning moment in the Civil War.  Despite all the legions of books written on the Civil War, few good movies have been attempted.  I think some of the bad reviews this movie receives are from those who have little knowledge of the history and just get bored because they can't follow what's going on.  Pity that they can't widen their minds a bit to enjoy what this film has to offer.  Also I think people are so use to politically correct messages in movies today that they can't appreciate something that does not do that for a change.  Gettysburg tries to tell a story of courage, tragedy and humanity during a pivital moment in American history.  It seeks to do no more or less than this.  Some may find the acting a little preachy or stiff, but that was they way people comported themselves 130 years ago.  Having been a one time Union re-enactor myself I can appreciate what these guys did to make this movie.  None of the re-enactors in this production were paid for their efforts.  They did this for the love of the hobby and to leave a lasting monument for the Civil War for future generations to see and enjoy.  The movie stays close to Michael Sharra's original book &quot;Killer Angels&quot; with only the tile changed to Gettysburg to make it more marketable to audiences.  Ted Turner financed this project, and while it might be considered vanity on his part,  the end result is a classic of its kind.  I only wish he could have paid the re-enactors for their fine efforts.  As it was he got a great movie for a fraction of the costs.  The current production, &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; done by Sharra's son Jeff continues the saga in the<br />earlier period of the war.  The new movie is fine, but probably not quite as good as Gettysburg.  Its too bad the DVD version does not contain the director's cut which was offered as a special collector's edition a few years ago on VHS.  Still, this standard version is good and contains a lot of nice features to enhance the enjoyment of the movie.ill, this standard version is good and contains a lot of nice features to enhance the enjoyment of the movie.
6300182452|4.0|The many perceptive reviews here cover the film well, but I would suggest that much of the film, especially the first part, is really comedy. The opening scene is amazing. The Stranger rides into town. The populace gazes on him in apprehensive terror. He rides on. More fear and shuddering. On he rides, and on. Even more frightened glances from doors and windows... This goes on for EIGHT MINUTES, until the viewer has to either start giggling or stop watching. ...This is certainly a great and and thought-provoking film, worthy of all the other analyses found in the reviews; but I suggest that the comic/satirical element is not to be overlooked.
B00003CXXM|3.0|This movie has just come out on DVD in Australia.<BR>I wasn't going to watch it because I had read all the reviews of the script etc etc, and I was not impressed with the way it changed the story so much from the book, especially the fact that the bad guy in the book does not even exist in the movie. <BR>But I rented it anyway.<BR>I can say that I was pleasantly surprised. It's not too bad.<BR>Now... if they could change the beginning, change his name and the title of the movie, along with the one or two scenes that are actually in the book, it would have been GREAT.<BR>This has virturally nothing to do with the book other than the very basic plot. If you have read the book, pretend that this movie is not the same story. It's another and different Spy story. <BR>I was really looking forward to an updated version of the old mini series, this is not it. Maybe next time.
B00006LLNU|3.0|If you heard the previous album, Agaetis Byrjun, you *knew* you were going to buy this one. So what if it doesn't have a title and the songs don't have names? All you want is more of that atmospheric Pink-Floyd-from-Iceland thing. ...<br />This is the rural version of Godspeed You Black Emperor. ...

0670824399|5.0|\\"Matilda\\" is a fun and interesting novel. Matilda, the main character is a six year old girl who can move things with her eyes. She uses her powers to help her teacher, Miss Honey, and to get back at her parents who neglect her. Roald Dahl did a very good job writing this book. I like this book a lot because it's fun to read and it's hard to put down. I also recommend that you  watch the movie.

B000084T18|5.0|I don't care what you say but this CD is tight and I think even though it is not a classic like Illmatic, Ready to Die, or Doggy Style it still is one of the best Cd's to come out in the past 5 years ranking up there with some of the best. Obviously I am a big fan of his songs my top 5 would be: 1.Heat 2.P.I.M.P<BR> 3.In Da Club 4. Don't Push me 5. Bloodhound. You guys need to realize what has happened to 50 Cent(stabbed, shot, and etc.) and give him credit where credit is do. If you like listening to RAP and dont mind the explicit content then I say this is the CD to get. 50 Cent is the next up and coming rapper since B.I.G. and 2pac.

0060278250|5.0|A wonderful book for all ages...this is really NIx's best work in his Abhorsen series. Lirael is a character that captures bravery, integrity, vulnerablility and strength and blends them into a character that is concievably real...a beautiful and thrilling conclusion to a wonderful series! May there be many more to come!
0060254920|5.0|the book is really cool, because it has monsters in it.  its about a kid who gets sent to bed with out supper and he goes to a place where the monsters are.  i would recomend it to any kid who wants a good book to read, because this is one of the best out there

B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is one of the best of the past 5 years.  It is remarkably dark while still using Amy's amazing voice.  The tracks go from hard rock to piano music, a very interesting combination, plus the songs flow from the CD unlike some others such as Chevelle's Wonder Whats Next.  The soft songs are scattered throughout the CD and have a very pleasing aroma after a really dark song like Haunted or Tourniquet (sp?).  Overall it is a ten.
B0000894RZ|5.0|For a time, albeit brief, it looked as though British  dance-soul siren Lisa Stansfield was headed for a major love affair with America, having scored huge out of the gate with 'All Around The World'.  Alas, the highly fickle American buying public never really took to Stansfield the way they did fellow newcomer Mariah Carey back in 1990 much beyond that initial success.  Which is a shame, considering that Stansfield released several more noteworthy albums and singles, most of which are represented here.  'You Can't Deny It', 'This Is The Right Time', and 'Change' are just three examples of first-rate music that fell, for the most part, on deaf ears.  Beyond its' obvious musical value, this is another set that serves as a sad reminder of what folks stateside are missing.  If nothing else, maybe this first-rate collection will jog the memory of those who though Stansfield disappeared after her first two releases.
B00007BH5C|5.0|This is an amazing soundtrack, what more can I say. It has  a wonderful selection of songs from the movie. If you liked the music from &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, buy this today!<br />   Many of the themes from the first movie are back, including the Fellowship theme, which is played a couple of times throughout the soundtrack. It also features the wonderful Rohan theme. &quot;Gollum's Song&quot; takes a while to get used to, but you'll learn to like it. Every track is worth your money!
B0000844I8|3.0|What the hell happened to the picture in this DVD release?  Looks a little blurry or fuzzy, and seems to have a yellow haze in most scenes.  The only thing this release has going for it is the awesome sound.  BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I am NOT a &quot;pop-music&quot; fan.  I usually listen to heavy/death metal and classical music.  This CD blew me away... It is not stupid and corny like the American boy bands and Brittany-- These girls are full of talent.  The tracks include rave/dance and metal riffs, a combination that usually doesn't work.  This CD is well worth the money.  I think the best tracks are #2 &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; and #5 &quot;How Soon is Now?&quot;  I will be buying the Russian-language import soon.
B000084T18|5.0|im feeling the whole cd. i had thought that this cd was gonna be stupid but once i had went out and bought it i liked it. i listen to the cd all the time. if u have it then i bet they would probably say the same thing but i had went out and bought it and like it. now i cant stop listening to the cd. so go and get it if u dont have it.
B000031WBQ|5.0|The Rubinstein/Reiner recording of the Rachmaninoff Second has always been one of my favorites-I have it in two different LP issues, and also on an early CD release-so I am probably prejudiced by so many repeated hearings.  Compared to other recordings, such as Cliburn/Reiner, this one does indeed flow a little faster, but to describe it as &quot;alarmingly fast,&quot; as one of your reviewers did, seems inappropriate.  It is worth noting, in fact, that Rubinstein's recording is actually SLOWER than Rachmaninoff's own recording reissued on Naxos.  It is typically Rubinstein (at least to my experience), in that Rubinstein (and Reiner) do not distort the overall structure of the work by swooning over the music.  Rubinstein is subtle; his recordings grow on you with repeated listening.  For example, on first hearing his stereo recording of the Chopin nocturnes, I was disappointed at what I thought was his failure to emphasize certain passages; as I became more familiar with the recordings, however, I realized that he was in fact very much aware of those passages, but he never indulged them to the point that they destroyed the structure as a whole.  Comparing his recordings of the Second with Rachmaninoff's, I find that not only is he a little bit slower than Rachmaninoff, but he also lets the music relax where it needs to, even more so than Rachmaninoff.  Coupled with my favorite recording of the Paganini variations, I highly recommend this issue.
B00005JL78|3.0|entertaining at best, this future film about cops being bad guys and the good guys wining in the end is not much and not worth your money.  The story plot and writing was wonderful but the acting didn't measure up at some points in the film.  And the people in the water was a little over the top. It's something to at least check out!
0316666343|5.0|I had heard nothing about this book when I got it as a Christmas gift.  I began reading it the night I got it and finished it a couple of days later.  It gives an interesting perspective of what Heaven might be like, but that wasn't what the book was about (as some people are saying).  How does a family go one after a child is kidnapped?  When all of the media hype goes away, what is everyone left with?  We see what happens to Susie's parents, siblings and friends.  It's an emotionally heavy book but it is truly like no other I've read.
B00002E23E|5.0|My initial thought of these four phenominal artists, to say the least are \\"legendary\\".This unique band was a head of there time when it come to writing,and making this music.There is no doubt in my mind,they paved the way for many musicians and song writers in the industry.Individually,they were the best at what they did,and that was making kick ass music.

Developing a keen eye for color and crucial to the subtle work required in such gifted artistry she provides us with a view to works in progress from blank canvas to completed painting.<BR>An excellent book which is quite different from anything I've ever read.
B00006BTCA|5.0|The only real complaint that I have about the album is that the opening to one of the songs, sounds exactly like the opening to Joy Division's \\"Shadowplay.\\" A good is a good a record but this is a great record...I take the \\"L\\" everywhere which means that I listen to music...a lot...a weed I had this record in my cd player.
B00005JKZT|5.0|After watching The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, I was hooked.  I could not wait for the Two Towers to come out.  When it did, I was not disappointed!  I liked the second better than the first!  Orlando Bloom (Legolas) is amazingly good looking, and his friend Aragorn (Mortensen) isn't bad either!  As soon as I watched this movie, I immediately started reading the books.  I wanted to know how the adventure ended.  This is a wonderful story of bravery and adventure, and you will not be disappointed if you watch it!

0060537639|4.0|I enjoyed this book for one simple reason. It attempted to explain facts by connecting the dots of information using solid speculative techniques (read &quot;Blind's Man Bluff&quot; and see how the Navy tries to find a missing submarine). Of course it is speculative!  That's the whole point of the book. If you can explain the facts presented with another theory, then print it.
B000089RVX|5.0|When i first heard about how good \\"Bring Me to Life\\" was, I was kinda skeptical about a rock band with a girl lead singer. I wasn't being sexist, its just that I grew up with male vocals on everything. So, one day I was sitting on the bus on my way home from school, and the radio was on a local rock station. Next thing I knew, the song was playing, and after it finished, I was speechless. I awaited this CD with impatience. Finally, my friend Paul, bought the CD when it came out and made me a copy. I listened to the whole CD, and I was speechless. Amy Lee is one of the most talented vocalists I've heard since becoming a fan of Maynard James Keenan and his band Tool. Her vocals on many of the songs are hauntingly beautiful. And the songs are amazingly well written. Tourniquet is an excellent song. Going Under is a definetly good opening to the CD, with Amy Lee singing \\"Now I will tell you what I've done for you\\" as soon as the song starts. then, there's Bring Me to Life, a classic song that will always be a favorite of mine. Then comes Everybody's Fool, which is an excellent song(\\"And somehow you've got everybody fooled\\", which turns to \\"And somehow you are everybody's fool\\"). Then, things continue with some great songs: Tourniquet(\\"My god, my tourniquet, Return to me salvation\\"), Imaginary, Hello, and My Last Breathe, some of the best on the album. And what amazes me is how good guitar riffs, occaisional piano playing, and Amy Lee's vocals combine to make a CD that is so great, that I zone out and mentally leave this world whenever I listen to it...<br />Good job, Evanescence, keep going and don't stop...
B00000FC5H|4.0|Perfect compilation for the novice who wants to explore this great group.  Only thing I would have done differently is take off &quot;Saturday Nite&quot;, &quot;Kalimba Story&quot; and &quot;Gratitude&quot; and added &quot;Keep Your Head To The Sky&quot;, &quot;Fall In Love With Me&quot; and &quot;Devotion&quot; instead.
B00005JKBC|4.0|We went to a double feature, ostensibly to see David Mamet's 'Heist' and stuck around for 'Spy Game.'  This Redford/Pitt thriller was the far better movie.  It really grabs you right from the beginning and never lets up.<br />'The Recruit,' a 2003 release starring Al Pacino and Colin Farrell, tries to mine the same vein of hotshot CIA recruit with wizened mentor.  Again, 'Spy Game' is the far better movie.<br />Two things worth pointing out:<br />1) The depiction of 1980s-era war-torn Beirut was spectacular.  The only setting in recent memory that ranks with it is Ridley Scott's depiction of Mogadishu in &quot;Black Hawk Down.&quot;<br />2) Redford is fabulous here as a guy pulling all the levers and working every back channel he can in Langley.  God knows if it was realistic, but it sure felt a lot more believable than the CIA environment depicted in 'The Recruit'.<br />Definitely worth your time to check out 'Spy Game'.
B00005JM93|5.0|First of all, I love this movie and want to recommend that people see it preferably at the theater.<BR>This is one of the most uneasy, nerve-wracking and disgusting films Ifve ever seen.<BR>Scenes go like this;<BR>Vacant chat between 2 men -> Arrested man in front of eRectalf -> Injured man to an ambulance -> Desperate search for the raper -> Happy incidents before the assault -> Disgusting assault in a pedestrian tunnel -> Brutal manslaughter in eRectalf -> Literal message from the director Gasper Noe<BR>I feel this film is about the relationship between LOVE and TIME. A must-see art.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|One of my favorite films is STRICTLY BALLROOM.  The 1992 sleeper hit directed by Baz Luhrman is a gem. This was Luhrman's first feature film as director before going on to direct the hugely popular \\"Romeo + Juliet\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" <br />Luhrmann cleverly uses a documentary style opening and interludes which pull you into the film and make you quickly form bonds with the loveable characters on the way. The storyline follows Scott Hastings (Paul Mercurio), one of Australia's great hopes in the competitive world of ballroom dancing. Surrounded by dance, Scott's parents own a small dancing school, those around him live for the dream that Scott will win the Pan Pacific Championship trophy with dancing partner Liz (Gia Carides.) Surely the most enthusiastic for Scott to achieve ballroom greatness is his mother Shirley, a former dance champion herself, who's iron determination and fraught ambition fills the air with tension, very much the antithesis of her husband Doug who is timid and all but mute.  The road to starlight stardom is rocky for Scott who's passion for dance and natural talent means he wants to escape the strict rigours of the ballroom rules. Scott wants to dance his own steps - Scott is a rumba rebel. As those around him panic that he will be too individual for the rule-bound ballroom world, his chances of success seem distant as his regular dance partner leaves. There only seems to be one person who believes in Scott's vision, Fran the ugly-duckling dance pupil.  Fran's own love of dancing is equally as perplexing to her family. From a traditional Spanish family with strong dancing bonds they will not accept that ballroom is anything more than mickey mouse dancing, a mutilated form of 'real' movement.   <br />Ballroom dancing, a pastime that is ridiculed by many may not seem the obvious choice for a feature film, but \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" elevates it status to a new level.  One of humor and admiration. The film takes the sequins and dusts them with glitter. The dresses are flouncy, the hair is bleached and the tans are permaglow but it is done with such affection, such humor you know the director actually has the upmost respect for this dazzling community and takes that admiration and transforms the film into a small masterpiece.<BR> <BR>Without doubt Paul Mercurio (Scott Hastings) has a wonderful and brooding presence throughout the film. Possibly not since John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever has a dancing man on screen set the heart fluttering as much.  Remarkably graceful, manly and sexy - here's a leading man you want to literally sweep you off your feet. He comes across with great passion. Tara Morice as Fran also turns in a superb performance. Thanks to careful direction and use of costume and make-up her transformation from ugly-duckling is not as crude as in so many other films, there's no stereotyped secretary with a bun and glasses scenario here. The whole character of Fran revolves around subtlety and growth with Morice brings across very well.  The supporting cast all deserve credit especially Scott's parents, Shirley played by Pat Thompson (Strictly Ballroom was her last film before her death) and Doug played by Barry Otto.  ntonio Vargas stars as Fran's father Rico and in reality is a well respected Flamenco dancer and actually worked as the dance trainer on the film.  <br />Films rarely come more feelgood than this. It is as happy and loud as the dancers sequined dresses. It is pure glitter on a the screen and a film to lift the spirits.  Highly recommended!
B00003CWN3|5.0|When I originally saw this movie I gave it 4 stars.  Now on rewatching I'm giving it 5.  It lost a star because though an excellent movie I did think it dragged in some sections and parts became quite tedious.  However, it is on rewatching that you can really appreciate the mastery of the movie.  The true life story of Teena Brandon, who masqueraded as a man and found a place among a family in Nebraska as well as a girlfriend, Lana (Chloe Sevigny), who upon discovering he's really a she realises she loves Teena/Brandon anyway.<br />What makes it better second time round is the ominous sense of foreboding over the whole scenario once you have the ending in mind the whole time.  It's difficult to know where to begin with explaining why the movie is so good.  The obvious point is Hilary Swank, who gives in one of the truly great female performances of all time as Teena/Brandon.  She reportedly prepared for the role by living as a man for 4 months and all of her mannerisms, the way she holds herself and how she talks are all evident of this.  You will actually believe that a very attractive woman (just see her doe-eyed performance in Insomnia) is a young man.  Every single part of her performance here is multi-faceted, speaking anguish, pain and fear of discovery in every gesture.  Her best scenes though are those where she is interviewed by unsympathetic police officers after her rape, stumbling over the words as she is forced to reveal not only to the police officers but herself what she really is.  This is an absolutely heartbreaking moment that, for me, had more power than the horrific rape scene.  A lot of people will have a problem with this scene and it's understandable because it is horrific to watch, and you will find yourself repeating to yourself that you can't believe this really happened.  Incidentally, the questions asked at the police station at the end are reportedly the real thing, a tape of the questions asked to the real Teena Brandon.<br />Of course,to praise Hilary Swank isn't to forget Chloe Sevigny, who is perfect in her role as a bored small-town girl who's looking for something, anything to break the boredom.  Her wide-eyed performance works wonders and she complements an all-round impressive cast.  Yet the movie also works as an emotional catharsis and besides perhaps depressing you horribly does ask some pretty important questions about identity and prejudice.  There are a few scenes that will probably stick in your head, such as the mother's firm avowal that she hates Teena/Brandon simply because he lied to her, something that goes hand-in-hand with freely admitting people she knows as rapists into her home.  In the end this is basically a story of not love gone wrong but love forced off its path by petty prejudices and narrow-minded ideals of what love should be about.  And whilst this ideas are never shoved down your throat by Pierce, you will definitely be left wondering this.  Boys Don't Cry is a magnificent piece of filmmaking that may stand as one of the truly great indie films of all time.
B000005ALN|5.0|George Michael is one of the few artists that has been able to redefine his image and musical style with every album.'Older' clearly reflects the break from his teen-idol image of the 80s and early 90s to a more sophesticated one. While the album isn't the stereotypical upbeat pop album that usually has wide commercial appeal, the songs are well-crafted and exhibit a very high degree of musical creativity.<br /><br />'Jesus to a child' is a gorgeous and moving ballad dedicated to a dead lover.'Fast Love' is clearly the best dance track of the 90s. Other picks include 'Strangest Thing','Older' and 'Spinning the Wheel'. With this album, George Michael has established himself as one of the greatest musical geniuses of all time.<br /><br />  Don't go by what the critics have to say about this album. It almost seems like they crave for replicas of his 1987 album 'Faith'. 'Older' is far superior to 'Faith' and his best album ever. George Michael has moved many of us with his soulful voice and beautiful songs. I sincerely hope there is more to come from one of the greatest musicians and songwriters ever. I don't believe we've heard the last of George Michael.
B000002H33|5.0|It's a classic album. The best song is the title song &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot;. The solos and the lyrics rocks the world. It is a big masterpiece. This is how I rate the songs.<br />Battery: I like the intro of the song, then it goes to a realy fast tune, but I LIKE it: A<br />Master Of Puppets: Perfect, just perfect. There's nothing in this song and it is my favorite Metallica song: A+ (With honor and pride)<br />The Things That Should Not Be: Okay, this is a good song. It takes a while to like it: A-<br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium): Beautiful, amazing, and great. I like the tunes of this song and it is so melodic: A+<br />Disposable Heroes: I love this song a lot, it's another 8 minute song which is worth listening more than one time: A+<br />Lepar Messiah: Brilliant. I enjoy this song very much. It's worth listening several times, but I enjoy the solo: A<br />Orion: One sentence: The best instrumental song I had ever heard: A+<br />Damage Inc.: I liked the intro of this song, but it is not much. It is okay: B+<br />All in all, I still say the best metal album of all time. Buy it or you'll regret it.

B00006RU5B|5.0|The New Audioslave Cd is probably the best Ive ever heard. I got it about 2 or 3 weeks ago I think, and since the moment it entered my CD player it has been ALL I listen to! I really don't have any negative comments about it. The guitar is more than amazing, and Chris Cornell's voice is just something else... I'm not sure how to put it into words. Especially track 11... the solo is crazy! Everytime I hear it I just enter some strange state of shock and amazement.I mean, I love every song, but there are a few that stand out more than oters for me, like, Getaway Car, I Am The Highway, What You Are, Shadow on the Sun and Like A Stone. That's almost the entire Cd but I guess it just goes to show how great the whole CD is!! They are my new favorite band. Audioslave has it. What more can I say? For ANYONE who doesn't have this CD, I advice you to get it NOW... It belongs in everyone's CD collection!
6304712936|5.0|Even as a kid, I knew this movie was special.  It was entertaining, funny, dramatic and clever.  But it went well beyond that.  This is a story about man and god.  About effort and gift.  About natural inborn talent versus hard work and sacrifice.  It makes you think about fairness and corruption, and you can't help but identify strongly with the villain of the peice.<br />The performances in the movie are brilliant, with the possible exception of Mozart's wife, Constanza, who I found to be cloying and annoying.  Mozart himself is a study in the contradictions so common to the human condition.<br />How is it that beauty, true beauty, can come out of the corrupt?  And how is it that those who seek to do the right thing can so often fall into dishonor?<br />These are amongst the questions asked by the film and they stay with you long after the credits roll.
0316921173|5.0|David Foster Wallace is the kind of author who makes aspiring writers weep for both joy and self-pity. He is so good that it hurts inside. This book contains everything anyone would ever want to read on both hope and hopelessness. Touching, hilarious and scarily clever, this mammoth novel is worth the time. I advise everyone to pick it up yesterday and call in sick to work until they've read it twice. And while the footnotes seem like a nusiance, and finding two bookmarks can be hard, by the end of the book you'll find they have been worth the trouble. Ignore the &quot;Hipster Handbook,&quot; Wallace is no poser, he's just a super cool writer with a lot on his mind.
B0000399WI|5.0|Handled with delicacy, symbolism and a kind of artistry one would never expect from the King of Horror, the Shawshank Redemption is simply transformative.  It will make you think about your life, about human nature, and about what a marvelous animal is man.<br />It's one of the best movies of all time, and I don't say that lightly.
B000062XM3|5.0|Fight Club is an in-your-face film which reflects reality and socilogy better than any other movie I can think of. It begins with the protagonist, his insomnia, and finding solace in attending support groups. He is also materialistic browsing through IKEA catalogues looking for the 'dining set that best defines him' and works at a lucrative job. His life is about to chance when he meets the eccentric and somewhat psychotic Tyler Durden on an airplane, and ends up living with him aftersome extenuating circumstances. Throughout the film, Durden (played brilliantly by Brad Pitt) and the protagonist (Ed Norton) form their own way of life, randomly being philosophical and observing human nature and obstentanious materialism, and the 'fight club' they started turn into a mini-army, and the ending of the film is one of the most surprising twists ever in a movie. <BR>Adding to Norton and Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter plays the pessimistic ..., Marla Singer, who serves as a nuisance to the narrator but an object of Tyler's 'affection' (if you want to call it that). Surprisingly, Meat Loaf (that's right... that guy) plays Bob, a person whose life was destroyed by testicular cancer who is the protagonist's allie at Remaining Men Together (a support group for men w/ testicular cancer) and eventually joins the somewhat sadistic yet therapeudic ring of fight club. <BR>This movie is destined to be a classic. Powerful dialogues, breathtaking performances, suspense at every scene, and a study in sociology and humanity, only a few movies have reached the intensity of Fight Club. It's a film that demands to be analyzed and seen many times for pleasure or observation.
B00003CX95|5.0|I really want to give this movie 4 1/2 stars because when you compare it to other historical classics, it's a bit kitchy and glossy.  Too over-produced.  Too Hollywood.<br />But insofar as Hollywood is going to be making historical movies for the masses, this one is a great one.  Well-structured, well-told, and entertaining.  The musical score, incidentally, is outrageously good.
630503723X|4.0|Perhaps this movie stands out for me, since I saw it as a doubleheader with Emmanuelle I in original movie release.  Of the two, it was clearly the more sensual.  Yes, there is sex, but clearly there is more sensuality.  I have been in S.E.Asia, so I did make a connection (although my time was certainly not like that).  The bathhouse scene certainly raises the temperature of the room, and  perhaps other things....  This movie certainly captures the time when sex was guiltless and without any health concerns (pre AIDS).  This movie certainly is not R rated, but does not have the hard edge that more explicit movies can have.  Perhaps one can think of it as how sex could be in a hedonistic environment with no concern of any consequences.  This is a good DVD to have in a collection of sensuality.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Especially if you're Italian, these movies are going to be ones that you've seen a thousand times and will see a thousand more times until you can recite the dialog by heart, and still find the movie compelling.<br />When you flip the channels and its on, you find yourself watching it anyway.  The saga, the messages, the story are all compelling and draw you in.  But then there's the culture, portrayed so familiarly that you feel like its a home movie at times.<br />It's guaranteed to stir something inside you, and not just hunger for pasta.

B00003CWRX|5.0|The man can act, and this movie proves it.  Yeah, he's obnoxious in interviews and he needs to learn a thing or two about humility, but the real reason he won his Oscar was not for Gladiator.  It was for this movie (the Academy had to keep it in mind).<br />The Insider is both dramatic, sheds light on our system, and happens to be true on top of all of that.  Own it and think about what you'd do in the protagonist's situation.
B000003TA4|5.0|Art is the Freedom of Expression of ones feelings.Unlike those who gave this album a low rating,Kurdt did not discriminate against any of his feelings.He let it all hang out the good, the bad, and the ugly.On NEVERMIND self expression was always the goal.The goal was Not to impress others only to express himself.Some say this album is depressing and you know they're right but it's also rebellous,scary,funny,sad, and dumb.But whatever it is it's always Kurt.When i listen to this album i can't make a judgement whether it's good or bad because i'm too busy relating to it.<BR> now let me meat the review requirements-- this album contains harsh yet sometimes smooth tones that lay a top a bed of slow and fast rythmes.Sometimes Kurdt will hit the guitar hard sometimes softly.Most of the time Kurdt sings sometimes others will harmonize.It sounds a lot like pinkfloyd or rush but different and also there is dave and krist who play in a psycho funny depressingly meaningful ground breaking repetetive kind of way.In summary this album is well produced grunge with a twist of lemon.Please ignore my review and get nevermind.
0064407667|5.0|When Mr. Poe comes to the three Buadelaire youngsters, they have no idea that their whole life was going to change right then and there. Mr. Poe Explained to the children that their parents died in a horrible fire at their mansion. The children end up living with their mean cousin, Count Olaf. He treats them horrible and is after their fortune. He comes up with a plan to ruin the children's lives and get all their money.<BR>    This book was great and I read it all in one day. I just couldn't put the book down. While I was reading it, I discovered that the reason I could not put it down was because I just had to find out what horrible thing would happen next. The book is filled with unfortunate situations, but it still made me feel good to be reading it. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes a good read.<BR>    This book has taught me to listen to what everyone has to say, even if they are not my most important priority. Even though I can't really relate to this story myself, I know that a lot of children are going through a similar situation. That is why we should always make sure everything is o.k. with where they are living, instead of just leaving them there and never check on them like Mr. Poe did to the Buadelaire children.

B00006G8O1|5.0|Donnie Darko is by far one of the best movies I have seen. There are no words that can really describe this movie but I can give a few that would come close: Sad, Beautiful, Inspirational and Interesting. Its one of those movies you watch, and then just want to be in a quiet state and think, think about your life. It sure made me open up my mind in ways I would never imagine I could.
B00005JLXC|1.0|I had a feeling that this movie wasn't going to be all that great when I first saw the commercials for it.  I new that it wanted to be Spiderman really really bad.  Well, lets say this, they got it half right: they got the really really bad part down no problem.  Where should I start?  They were going for some dark, moody, depressing atmosphere, and it just came off as fake.  The title character was also a major dissapointment.  They turned Daredevil into a cold-blooded killer.  Then, after killing people, he says stuff like,\\"I'm not a bad guy\\".  Well, its like this, if you kill people by cutting them in half on train tracks, or just kill people period, you're not that great of a guy.  Also, Daredevil kills one bad guy (I'm not going to name names, because somebody might want to see this mess and I don't want to ruin the story like this movie did) and then spares the next one, saying,\\" I'm no bad guy\\", just twenty minutes after he killed the previous villan in cold blood.  Some hero.  The characters weren't that great either.  They were shallow, flat, and cookie cutter.  The fight scenes were lame (they threw in some random heavy metal song whenever they saw the opportunity) and poorly done.  The most retarded part of the movie had to be when Electra was using her sais to cut up sand bags that fell from the ceiling and were suspended by a string.  There was no point to this scene and it wouldn't have been \\"cool\\" even if it did have a point.  I'm going to give this movie one star for three reasons, Bullseye was the only cool person in the entire movie, you can't give a movie a rating of zero on amazon.com, and it was in color.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence transcends normal youth oriented music, releasing a debut that is intelligent and musically well-done. The irony of it all is that such mature music has been available from artists in Europe for years. In terms of similarity, I felt that Nightwish, Within Temptation, and Edenbridge are similar albeit heavier. The many comparisons to Tori Amos are unjustified and misplaced since Tori's music is often simply a cryptic diatribe rather than an artistic expression. It is about time that America is introduced to the power of the female voice in heavy music without it being slutted up and exploited. Maybe the success of this album will spur other bands to take chances rather than produce the usual cookie cutter music that makes fast money but lacks depth. Go to Evanescence's website to see their bio. You'll not only admire the band, but admire their tenacity in terms of wanting to do it right or not at all. THIS IS THE TYPE OF BAND THAT SHOULD BE ON OZZFEST, NOT THESE FAUX TEEN PUNK BANDS.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Hear me now and believe me later: this movie is one of the most important movies you will ever watch. Not only is it a great movie in it's own right, but the message it espouses is something everyone needs to hear.<br />As Brad Pitt says in the movie, \\"You are not your job, you are not the clothes you wear...\\" An anti-materialism theme rings loudly throughout the movie, and it's something everyone should think about. \\"It is when we have nothing that we are free to do anything.\\"<br />Some reviews said the movie is fascist. That is wrong. If anything, the movie has a Communistic flavor. The party works together for the betterment of the people working in it. They all live together and work in shifts to mutually help the other party members. Their ultimate goal is to bring down the corporations and dissolve the state, aka the bourgeoisie. And as the group demonstrates in the scene with the Chief of Police, it is the working class, everyone around you, that is responsible.<br />But don't let a fear of Communism get in the way of you watching this movie. The other themes and messages are important as well. Not only that, but it's just a darn good movie, with a great surprise ending.<br />The DVD comes packed with hours upon hours of extra footage, including 4 full-length commentaries and a plethora of deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes vignettes. <br />The bottom line is: see the movie. Buy the movie, whether you have to get this DVD, the single-disk DVD, the VHS, the LaserDisc or the 8mm film. Whatever you need to do, this movie is important, and everyone should experience it.

B000002GQL|5.0|I'm not sure I can add anything new to what's already been said. In particular, Lonnie E. Holder pretty much said many of the things I would have said (read his June 3, 2002 review for a good synthesis on the album.)<br /><br />As the closing album of The Moodies' \\"classic 7\\" period, there's definitely a shift in dynamics and mood from the lighter (but thought-provoking), trippy and spaced-out (but fairly accessible) material from their earlier albums. On _Seventh Sojourn_, the mood is more somber and earthy, which was probably highlighted by the fact that the guys were going through a rough period around that time period. Also, the music, while still ethereal, wistful and touching, is a bit more earthy and straightforward.<br /><br />The way I see it, the album is divided into two halves: The first half features the wispy, new age-tinged rock/pop that The Moodies are pretty known for, while the second half becomes more straightforward and edgy, as some of the tracks rock a little harder than usual.<br /><br />\\"Lost In A Lost World\\" sounds a bit ahead of it's time, mainly because of the percussion. It reminds one a bit of The Beatles, yet it still sounds like a unique fusion done only the way The Moody Blues could have. Features new age, r&b and almost Indian flavors, but topped off with a funky drum beat and rhythm that sounds years ahead of it's 1972 release. The lyrics are deep and thought-provoking, and the luscious vocal harmonies are touching. \\"New Horizons\\" is an achingly touching tribute written by singer/guitarist Justin Hayward to his deceased father. The sad orchestrations, combined with Justin's plaintive vocals and the overabundant melody leaves an overwhelming effect. \\"For My Lady\\" is written and sung by flautist Ray Thomas. He's usually the writer of the Moodies' most whimsical tunes. While there's still a fair amount of whimsy here, the somber quality still outweighs anything else on this folk-ish track. \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" was written by bassist John Lodge, and the title pretty much speaks for itself, as it's a reflection on the stagnations and vicissitudes of life. The choiral-like chorus' are especially moving.<br /><br />The second half starts off with \\"You And Me,\\" which is a fairly upbeat rocker. The execution here makes this track sound the most dated, but, I personally like this aspect, as it actually sounds like something that could have come from one of the Moodies' 60s albums. \\"The Land Of Make Believe\\" sounds like a mid-tempo, but more sophisticated British-r&b track, especially during the main verses. \\"When You're A Free Man\\" features some nice chord changes (Dmin7 and E minor being the opening chords), and some gentle, but tasteful soloing from Justin Hayward. For some reason, some of the atmospherics on this track, particularly the slow tempo, the absorbing and lyrical solos, remind me slightly of Pink Floyd - mainly of their song \\"Time.\\"  Even the vocals (which may have been sung by Mike Pinder, I'm not quite sure) sound a bit like Pink Floyd's lead singer, David Gilmour. Yet, \\"Time\\" was released in 1973, and this was released in 1972. Very strange. \\"I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band)\\" seems to lighten up the mood a little bit, to an otherwise somber album. It's also (surprise!) the most hard rocking and upbeat on here.<br /><br />As their most mature album, this is possibly my favorite from them, and that's not an easy thing for me to say. As such, if you're a fan of most of their 60s stuff, and haven't heard this, the somber quality of this album may take some getting used to. But, this shows them at their most sophisticated, mature, earthy and possibly pained (they would not return for another 4-5 years, and keyboardist Mike Pinder would leave.)

B00005JKDQ|3.0|I enjoyed the movie as an adult, but why does Disney have to put in so much violence into their movies these days? Do they really feel that they have to scare the 3-4-5 year old kids. I was really disturbed when they clamped the 3 year old girl into a chair and were pushing a machine upto the childs mouth to suck the screams out of her. I looked at my daughter (who was 5) and she was terrified. There was nothing humorous in the violence (it was not done tongue in cheek unlike the Bugs Bunny cartoons). This violence was intended to be hurtful and real.<br />I am afraid that Disney needs to build the murderous plots into their movies. Let's briefly look at the list:<BR>1. Lion King - Uncle murders father<BR>2. Beauty and the Beast - Gaston stabs beast with knife.<BR>3. Monster's Inc. - Attempted murder, kidnapping<BR>4. Hunchback of Notre Dame - Almost drops baby into well...<BR>5. Lilo and Stitch - Aliens try to kill Stitch<BR>6. Tarzan - Don't they kill the mother Gorilla and try to kill Tarzan?<br />Should these be rated G?<br />I am a big fan of the stuff done in the 60's and 70's. A lot of it was done with a wink and a nod and a sense of fun. <BR>1. Winnie the Pooh<BR>2. Mary Poppins<BR>3. The computer who wore tennis shoes (The whole Dexter Riley series with Kurt Russel)<BR>4. Herbie the Love Bug<BR>5. Snowball Express<BR>6. Most of the Wonderful World of Disney<br />I have to admit that even during this time Disney did a few movies which had murder in them (but not everyone). I think the writers at Disney could be more creative and write a good story without relying on lame murder themes. I think Walt would agree. These are kids.<br />PS: I loved the Matrix, but I don't want my kids to watch it.

You guys have the worse grammer and are all depressed punk rock goths who are jealous cause the hip hop community gets more play and has more fun then you. I think this CD is pretty good, not the best CD but its not garbage like some of you say it is. Everyone has there own style and taste. All of you who gave this CD a 1 star are probaly 15 year old satanist with no lives because you like to slash your wrist on friday nights instead of going out and having fun like a normal teenager while you listen to your melvins or something. To the adults who post negative comments about this CD, dont let your kids listen to him if you dont like him. But instead of taking the time to post a comment about this being garbage for kids wh dont you go take care of your own kids before they rob me in ten years
B00005OAIE|4.0|I have owned this CD for nearly a year and a half now. I saw John in concert before the \\"No Such Thing\\" video came into heavy rotation. I love the fact that people feel the need to attack any artist who gains popularity. This album is very well crafted. Do not automatically buy into the garbage reviews this album has been dealt recently. Granted, the constant annoyance of hearing \\"No Such Thing\\" blasted in the mall and your local Wal-Mart may make you cringe...but, don't blame John Mayer for that. Blame radio. After all, they are wonderful at taking good music and playing it to death, while also associating it with things the artist may not have intended for it to be associated with. Simply stated, John Mayer is a musical artist. While he may not strike the overused power chords of Creed or mumble the incoherent lyrics of The Vines, he is a musician in his own right. If you enjoy well crafted, folk based music, I suggest you purchase this CD. Some of the standout tracks are \\"3x5\\", \\"St. Patrick's Day\\" and \\"Great Indoors\\". Listen with an open mind and you're sure to find something in it that reaches you. Happy listening~

0790729628|5.0|Loosely based on Phillip K. Dick's award-winning Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is one of the most memorable visions of the future presented to date.<br />The film seizes upon one concept from Dick's novel, the universal question of what it means to be human, and explores it through the pursuit of a group of renegade replicants--androids made to serve on extraterrestial colonies and so increasingly life-like so as to be nearly indistinguishable from humans save for their limited life spans--by a bounty hunter or \\"Blade Runner\\" from which the film takes its title.<br />Unlike Dick's novel in which the humanity of Deckard, the Blade Runner, is made clear and only questioned once, Ridley Scott reinforced the question of human nature by inserting a series of clues meant to suggest Deckard himself may be a replicant.<br />The director's cut of the film removes a voice-over narration by star Harrison Ford without compromising the story and replaces the \\"happy\\" ending of the theatrical release with one darker and more poignant.  The rainy, dark, and post-apocalytpic future in which the film is set remains unchanged and as memorable as ever.
B000007T1M|5.0|I owned Toxicity before I got this cd. Let me tell you, this one is way better!! It has powerful music that makes you want to shake your head around. Each song changes style so much that it's almost like 3 songs in one! Trust me, any fan of such bands as Korn, Slipknot, or Mudvayne would love the stuff these guys dish out: Pure Metal. SOAD, I salute on one fine cd!
6305508550|5.0|Though the situations and characters in Office Space are certainly larger than life, they are not that far from the truth--to which those of us in the corporate world will readily attest.  That's what makes the movie so delightfully funny: seeing characters on screen act out (without much exaggeration) the trials and tribulations of today's desk-bound workforce.<br />The plot of the movie itself is somewhat secondary to its entertainment value.  Basically, the main character (Ron Livingston) isn't happy with his job; having been asked once by his high school guidance counselor to picture what he'd do without being paid and consider that his ideal job, he responded that he's like to sit around and do nothing.  The rest of the main plot centers on his attempt to get his life back on track, from discovering a love interest in a local waitress (Jennifer Anniston) also unhappy with her job to plotting revenge on his company for firing his friends.<br />Quickly one sees exactly why the characters are so unhappy with their jobs: a clueless, paper-shuffling boss who speaks in total monotone; inane office regulations requiring more time spent on reports than on real work; faulty office equipment; and so on.  Carefully crafted to represent archetypes we all know from our own office experiences, the characters and their attempts to break free of the 9-to-5 drudgery are absolutely hilarious.<br />You don't have to be a computer programmer or engineer to enjoy this film--all you need is to have worked somewhere once in your life that was far from the ideal environment.  Watch this film and enjoy a laugh at schmucks who have it ten times worse than you ever have!
038542471X|5.0|Another magnificent, believable novel by John Grisham. Like other Grisham novels, I found it hard to put this one down. I found the ending to be totally appropriate; I feel that a proper ending to a book is difficult to write but Grisham ended this one quite properly. There were parts in the book that were meant to be humorous and I laughed out loud when I read them.
B00006ADFL|4.0|I would like to discuss a movie we enjoyed last night that has a strong tie-in with Mario Lanza, namely the 1994 film set in New Zealand,\\"Heavenly Creatures\\". This is based on the true story of two adolescent girls who become best friends and eventually develop an obsession with each other while living in the fantasy world they create. They worship Mario Lanza, the man and his music, and throughout the film the viewer is treated to many fine songs and Lanza visuals. First you hear \\"Be My Love\\" as Pauliine plays it on her parent's Hi-Fi (this was 1952..no stereo yet!). (Inaccuracy: she pulls the black labelled LP out of the famous red Student Prince cover!) Later, they find \\"Cavalcade of Show Tunes\\" at Juliet's house and another black label record falls onto the turntable playing the first cut of \\"Donkey Serenade\\". (Inaccuracy..wrong song!) Still later, there is a delightful sequence involving dancing and romping the countryside to \\"Funiculi, Funicula\\". (Innacuracy: he hadn't recorded this cut from the Mario! album yet) Then a young man dressed like Lanza in Great Caruso lip syncs to \\"Loveliest Night of the Year\\". We see photos of Mario hanging in the girls' bedrooms, see large poster of \\"Great Caruso\\", and even see a life sized animated singing clay Mario. Also, there are many references to Lanza throughout...\\"the greatest tenor in the world\\", etc.! Great funny line from a father, who says: \\"Mari O'Lanza...an Irishman, not an Italian\\". Mario sings \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" during the end credits.<br />The British film is wonderfully photographed and has brilliant directorial touches from Peter Jackson. It's an enjoyable movie, but deals with serious issues as murder, lesbianism, etc., and consequently feels rather odd.<br />The quality of the sound is excellent on the DVD with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. The picture quality is also excellent and is especially appealing in widescreen. Hope anyone interested gets to enjoy it as well!
B00008AY3L|5.0|I have every one of Ben Harper's Albums, and I can honestly say that &quot;Diamonds on the Inside&quot; does everything but disappoint. From the opening &quot;With My Own Two Hands&quot;, Harper hits you with a rythmic reggae beat, ultimately making one feel that he/she too can change the world. One of my favorites on the album however is &quot;Brown Eyed Blues&quot;. With a funky beat that even James Brown would appreciate, this track is ideal for a &quot;Friday night before the bar pump up session&quot;. Harper's spirituality, welcomed and respected, is beautifully conveyed through songs such as &quot;Picture of Jesus&quot; and &quot;Amen Omen&quot;, as well as &quot;When She Believes&quot;.  <br />Ben Harper is truly one of the best singer/song writer/musicians in this day and age, and it's a shame that he recieves no where near the acclaim that he has proved he deserves. While he may lose some fire in the studio as compared to the live stage, Ben Harper takes one on a funky, spiritual ride, with Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix ever present in the rear-view.
0064407667|1.0|I bought this book for my daughter who is 8. I decided to read it first though and am so glad I did! Now, there is no way known I will give it to her. This is an INCREDIBLY sinister and disturbing book. It may be very well-written but it is about child abuse and the threat [harm]. The supposedly \\"good\\" grown-ups are stupid and/or powerless, and the bad grown-ups are truly nasty without being even the slightest bit amusing. The children survive the horrible events by using their wits. While this sounds like it might be a good thing, the situations are entirely possible and real children would have wound up [harmed], dead or both. As is, even the fictitious children only just manage to escape. If your child is the least bit sensitive, don't buy this book.
B000002UEB|5.0|.....and you've got to be kidding me, what an idiot! There, i said it and i feel better.<BR> The fact is , Operation:Mindcrime may be the best overall record i've ever heard and will always be at the top of my list of favorites.<BR>  My first rock concert was seeing Queensryche , in 1983 supporting the Warning LP as the opening act for Kiss (....man! they made Kiss look really bad too!).From that night on i was a huge fan of the 'Ryche... and always will be. If anyone reading this ever has a chance to see these guys live, do yourself a big favor and go see 'em ( i've seen them 13 times), you'll never be disappointed and you'll probably be amazed.<BR>  ok, back to :Mindcrime. This record is amazing on so many levels. Geoff Tate , to start with, does his usual , unbelievable job on vocals . as far as singers go, he's the man and there's no close second. The band also has some of the best backing vocals i've ever heard... they lost a big part of that when  Chris DeGarmo left the band though (not to mention a great guitar player and one of the best song writers on that planet).<BR> One of the great things about this band is that they've never made 2 songs that sound alike... they're as diverse as it gets. this album is a great example of thier skill and diversity as songwriters,and musicians for that matter. Being that this is a concept album with a very complex storyline, it's amazing how smooth and seemless the story flows, while at the same time having very distinct songs... just one of many things they have to proud of on this record.<BR> Musically , it can't get much better. The guitar work buy Chirs DeGarmo and Michael Wilton is second to none as far as a duo goes. From the operetic \\"Suite Sister Mary\\" to the almost thrash \\"Needle Lies\\" these guys show thier skill and diversity without anything being overdone. The rythym section is always up to the challenge also. Eddie Jackson(bass,backing vocals) always gives this band backbone and presence without overdoing itand Scott Rockenfield (drums) has always been one of the best in the business... these guys all shine as musicians without getting away from the task at hand...making great songs, and in this case, an amazing album. <BR> Here it is 15 years later and this album is still my favorite of all time and maybe always will be. It would take something wicked huge to change my mind on that. if you don't have Operation:Mindcrime... get it, you'll love it....i promise. if there was ever a \\"must have\\" this is it. The reason i gave it 5 stars is because i could'nt give it more!... 'Ryche 'N' Roll !!!!!!!!
B00006RCLQ|3.0|I bought this DVD on a whim, and I'm pleased.<BR>It reminds me a little of Night of the Living Dead and The Tingler. The transfer from film could have been cleaner. The DVD still has all the \\"dirt & damaged film look\\" left in. In a way this adds to the character of the movie. The sound is in mono, and the DVD had no information inside (like a chapter list). No extra features other than chapter search here either. Can't complain, pretty good movie, cheap price, over an hour of entertainment. You can't rent for what it cost to buy this one.
B000089RVX|5.0|It has been a long time since I have heard anything like this.  Usually I will buy a CD and find there are a few tracks that grab me, and the rest is just filler, best skipped over.  There is no filler on this CD!  Every song is different and every song is inspired.  Amy Lee's voice just pulls you in and won't let you go.  She has such an incredible range and puts so much emotion into each song.   I'll admit I am a big fan of female singers like Sarah McLachlan, Kate Bush, or Tori Amos, but in my opinion Amy Lee's vocals are the best.  Haunting ballads, mixed with some great guitar tracks.  This CD is amazing!
B00004Z511|5.0|I know that a lot of the reviews on this site are fairly negative, and I can understand why a lot of people won't like this album, but I honestly think it's one of the most beautiful albums ever made.  I loved Amnesiac, but some of it is simply too dark and intense for me.  I never have the energy to listen to it.  On the other hand, Kid A strikes a perfect balance of beauty, intensity, despair, warmth, cold, and hope.  I think the reason a lot of people don't like it is that most people simply don't have the intellectual courage, stamina, or concentration to grasp what Radiohead's trying to do on this album.  It's not an album you can just throw into your car stereo and drive around listening to while you hang with your friends.  You have to be alone, or you have to be with other people who are willing to shut the hell up for the entire length of the album.  <br />If you really want to understand the power of Kid A, but you don't have much time to live, just start the cd on &quot;How to Disappear&quot; and let it play until the end of &quot;Optimistic.&quot;  If you don't like that sequence, then you are a bad person.
B000089RVX|5.0|This band is awesome!! The first time I heard their first release from the album \\"Bring me to Life\\" on the radio I had to find out who the band was. ... I told the DJ it sounded like a mixture of Sarah McLaughlin with Linkin Park. I heard the name of the band was Evanescence ...and got the album as soon as I could. The other songs I sampled were just as great. Her voice is incredible. This album is a must have!
B00005JGAB|5.0|This is not only classic punk, but just classic music all around.  I can remember putting in this tape in my car with my buddies and not speaking a word-just listening to the music all the way through.  From the first notes of 'Blitzkreig Bop'to the very end, just so classic.  Everything that music should be and more-it has melody, catchiness and a little humor mixed in.  If you have heard of the Ramones but have been hesitant to buy into their music, this is the one you really need.
B00008BXJF|4.0|I've been a Krim fan for a number of years, delving into their extensive back catalogue and following their current musical adventures with interest. With every new album, I'm always surprised how much I like it, and this one is no exception. This is lower, leaner, meaner Crimson, and they also haven't sounded this loose on an album in years (compared to the intricate and lockstep riffing of 'Construction of Light'). Pat's electronic percussion adds some technoid bounce on tracks like the amazing 'Level Five'.  The version of 'Eyes Wide Open' on this disc is as light as air, and I prefer it to the \\"Happy With..\\" EP version.  Drawbacks: 'Dangerous Curves' sounds like video game music, and much of this material has already turned up on various other releases, albeit not in as polished form as this disc.
B00005B36H|1.0|Anyone who actually can make any sense of the noise on this CD, and call it serious music, should be locked in a room with the boys from Hanson for 10 years: now that's torture man! This band along with countless others, System of A Down (the worst!) etc., always make me wonder one thing: if they're such great musicians, why not prove it? Why not show it? But, in these days of Noise-Rock-Sounds like everything else-Radio, it's the money and not any sense of passion for music. I would only tell you to listen to this CD if you comitted an atrocious thing, like losing a GOOD CD, with a great musician on it, someone like, Yngwie J. Malmsteen-THIS WOULD BE A SIN IN MY BIBLE! Only then punish yourself by having to listen to this one! ZERO RATING=0.
B00008BXJF|5.0|I just went to see them on their tour for this album in Toronto, it was my first King Crimson show.  I have never seen/heard anything like it.  I heard the new album on the way to Toronto, and I am impressed by how much the 3 tracks on the Level Five EP have progressed (Virtuous Circle is now called The Power to Believe Part II).  It is very well balanced with incredible mixing, and has a very good flow to it; it is one of these albums that you listen to from start to finish.<br />Their live show was perhaps even more intense than the album.  I wrote down their set list as they played, and here it is:<br />Main Set:<br />1. ConstruKction of Light<BR>2. ProzaKc Blues<BR>3. EleKctric<BR>4. Eyes Wide Open<BR>5. The World's my Oyster...<BR>6. The Power to Believe Part I<BR>7. Level Five<BR>8. Facts of Life<BR>9. Happy With What...<BR>10. The Power to Believe Part II<BR>11. Dangerous Curves<BR>12. Larks' Tongues in Aspic Part IV<br />Encore I:<br />13. Deception of the Thrush<br />Encore II:<br />14. Dinosaur<BR>15. VROOM<br />Actually, come to think of it I don't think they missed a track on the new album, but I am not familiar enough with it to be able to know all the songs when I heard them.  At any rate, I would like to point out that they did not play anything pre-dating THRAK, and even then they only barely scratched the surface of it in the encore.  This just goes to show that, although they are well in to their 4th decade of existence, they still sound more fresh and exciting than almost any other band out there.
B000021YQV|1.0|I can only imagine two things: either this singer is mocking retarded people (because he sounds like one), or this is Kermit The Frog singing with his nads being squeezed so tight he's a soprano! I think the kids in Hanson sang better than this-didn't they???? lol. Anyone who takes this band seriously should be locked in a room with Michael Jackson for a month: showers not included. On the other hand, this band is so funny to listen to, you might want a copy to keep around for when your friends are over and you're partying: this could have EVRERYONE on the floor rolling in laughter by midnight! Big Zero waste of time and money ... A 10 ZERO RATING.
1586210912|3.0|Are you a risk taker or an observer? Do you want to endlessly work for money, or are you tired of it and want to learn the basics of how to make money work for you? I enjoyed reading the book as a result of it's simplicity in content, but thought that the explainations were repetitive and diagrams ineffective. It is a quick read with everyday language that requires little to no thinking on the  part of a reader. This emphasizes the boook's main principle that wealth is no longer to be taught as only some far off illusion. Money management and financial planning skills aren't part of the current school curriculum, but with this book as a guildline young people can be introduced to the basics of the way out of the make money, spend money rat race. <BR> What's contained within the pages of this book? Intelligent money management begins with taking risks and learning to differentiate between assets and liabilities. Basially, assets make money and liabilities are those which require the use of one's money in order to function. The more assets, the more money in the long run. NO fear and outdated thoughts that only the rich get richer. The truth is, the rich get richer as  result of the poor staying uninformed and lazy. Invest and dot waste money. Practice self discipline and get educated. keep options on how to make money visible, possible and open. Don't give up, it won't happen over night and above all use the knowlege you can find from anywhere or anyone about money managment to take action and make your life more enjoyble in the process.
0060254920|4.0|The story is about a boy who rebels against his mother when it came to eating his supper.  He was sent to his room where he dreamed about living where The Wild Things Are.  Once there he became lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him most of all.  This aspect of the story is a perfect example of any child rebelling and later realizing that their parents love him/her and they love their parents.  The story is good for any child to listen or even read.  It contains a moral that we can all relate to at one point in our childhood life time.  That is why I would strongly recommend this book for any parent that has rebelling child.
0066214122|4.0|This book was great, I enjoyed it throughout, but not 5 star worthy. A great book I recommend but you will have read better. The end is pretty entertaining. You will enjoy the book and be glad you read it, but simply not the best out there.
0060537639|4.0|An enjoyable read but, as other readers have noted, it would have benefited from more liberal use of the blue pencil to tighten the prose, remove cliches and personal figures of speech. <br />One incident that is supposed to support the thesis is the story of the Mahogany Ship, the wreck of which is said to have been sighted in sand dunes at Warrnambool, about 200km SE from where I live. Difficulty is, despite all the speculation all we have is a couple of ancient anecdotes. A lot of time, money, and scientific expertise has been spent probing the dunes and grazing land near Warrnambool, over decades, with absolutely nothing to show for it. The search continues.  These is an equal amount of speculation that the so-called Mahogany Ship was a Portugese caravel lost in about 1522, or a Spanish vessel. Another explanation is that the principal witness was simply a liar.  Mr Menzies does not acknowledge these easily accessible alternative explanations.
6304698798|5.0|This is my favorite Western and I've seen plenty. Many consider Once Upon a Time in the West Leone's masterpiece and it's hard to argue, but I just don't like it as well as this one. First of all it contains one of the best performances by an actor I've ever seen--Eli Wallach as Tuco (the ugly). Secondly, it has so many layers. Sure, you have the three main characters who each embody either good (Clint Eastwood as Blondie), evil(Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes), or just plain ugliness (the aforementioned Eli Wallach as Tuco); but they're merely representations of what's going on around them and of the West in general. The West was good, bad, and ugly. Leone shows us a bunch of each in this brilliant film. <br />The relationship between Tuco and Blondie (as turbulent as it is) and the bravery both men possess would certainly be examples of the good. Perhaps my favorite scene in the movie is when Blondie and Tuco are walking down the street<BR>of the war-torn town in search of Angel Eyes and killing off his men one by one--never overly concerned that they're outnumbered. <br />The bad is best represented by the Civil War. No matter how hard Tuco and Blondie try they can't seem to escape the war going on all around them. Who can forget when they are at the monastery turned hospital, or the prison camp, or at the battle of the bridge. The horrors of war surround them. (And of course Lee Van Cleef is, if only briefly, the brutal prison sergeant.)<br />The ugly is best represented by the greed that pervades the entire film. Just watch Tuco count money or rob the dead. It's greed personified. And that finale. Wow! That's one of the greatest scenes ever filmed. The tension created by the masterful Leone in this scene is indescribable. Of course, it's by no means the only great scene--the film is brimming with them. <br />Finally, the music must be addressed. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly has one of the best soundtracks ever recorded. Ennio Morricone is one of the greats and this is his crowning achievement. In sum, see this film. It's one of the best.<br />P.S. ...If you want historical accuracy read a history book. This is a movie. Never did it claim to be based on a true story. One thing I think you will find to be accurate is how the characters look. Leone obviously took pains to make sure the actors were dirty (or at least looked it), their clothing was torn, they were unshaven, etc. This is certainly a more realistic portrayal of the people of the West than earlier Hollywood westerns which featured well-scrubbed, clean-shaven, neatly pressed actors.
0316548189|5.0|I read &quot;Long Walk to Freedom&quot; right after I graduated from college in 1996.  This is the written life of one of the absolute greatest world leaders who ever lived.  I had the pleasure to visiting Robben Island, where most of its tour guides were, like Mandela, political prisoners under apartheid.  Words cannot describe what it felt like to actually stand inside of the jail cell that Mandela occuppied.  What is even more incredible is that, looking back, the man was not the least bit bitter or angry about what he went through (and who could blame him if he were?); in fact, he invited his former jailers to his 1994 inauguration as South Africa's first black president.  <br />If after reading this book you do not come away with a greater sense of admiration and respect for this outstanding human being, then you are not human.
B000069HK2|5.0|the used,well, is probably one of the most underated bands around right now. aside from that the disc is also underated, this is the best cd i have bought in probably 5 years. i am a hardcore fan, as well as metal, and never has an emo band, touched me in a way that the used has. there music has such a raw emotion, and depth, as well as the lyrics and vocals. this is a very well put together disc from all angles. i highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys great music
B00005O5CM|5.0|&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; was one of the funniest films released in 2001.  The film stars the very talented Reese Witherspoon (known also for her role in the 1998 film &quot;Pleasantville&quot;) as sorority-queen Elle Woods, who majored in college in fashion merchandising.  The film begins with Elle being dumped by her boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis), who plans to attend the prestigious Harvard Law School.  Determined to be with Warner, Elle decides to take the L.S.A.T. so that she can apply to Harvard Law School herself.  After studying harder than she has ever done in her life, Elle passes the L.S.A.T. and films an introductory video of herself to send with her application to Harvard Law School.  The Admissions Committee at Harvard Law School approves and Elle begins her journey into a new life at Harvard.  Elle's vivacious, naive, sorority-party attitude doesn't exactly fit the typical Harvard Law School student.  However, after Elle meets Warner's snobbish fiancée, Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair), she is befriended by a poorly educated manicurist, Paulette Bonafonté (Jennifer Coolidge), who inspires Elle to become a more serious law student.<br />The film takes some unexpected turns as Elle is propelled into world of jurisprudence and the court of law.  Memorable scenes in the film include Elle's first law school class with Professor Stromwell (Holland Taylor), Elle's revealing costume, Elle explaining the dynamics of the &quot;bend and snap&quot; to Paulette, and Elle explaining perm maintenance in a courtroom.  Other wonderful characters include Emmett (Luke Wilson), Professor Callahan (Victor Garber), Brooke Taylor Windham (Ali Larter), the UPS Guy (Bruce Wilson), Enrique (Greg Serano), Chutney Windham (Linda Cardellini) and a brief appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham Vandermark.<br />&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; is an engaging and endearing comedy whose success resulted not only from a great story, but also the talents of Reese Witherspoon for making a fashion merchandising major turned law student plausible.  Overall, I rate &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; with a much-deserved 5 out of 5 stars.  I hope that its sequel to be released in July 2003 (&quot;Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde&quot;. also starring Reese Witherspoon) will be equally as funny and further demonstrate Elle Woods' passion for the study and practice of law.
B000089J0R|5.0|this band i had been paid more attention to their frist album after i heard their demo.<BR>they have a great speed solo and good allocation of instrument lay out. eash parts are perfect.<BR>i can say that they have a Rhapsody's style lyrics and speed. But use the metal style to play.<BR>so, it is a new trying and they are walking a right way.<BR>i like it!!

B000001EUL|5.0|Este y ningun otro, es el disco que marcó un antes y un después en la carrera del grupo. Ya sin Ulrich Roth y de la mano de la brillante guitarra de Jabs, el mundo entero pudo contemplar la magestuosidad de las composiciones de Schenker y Meine, en su mayor explendor: nos mostraron un nuevo concepto de balada, y un rock duro de grandes influencias alternativas:<br />1- Loving you sunday morning: primer himno de puro rock experimental del grupo encamindo antes de tiempo a los 80, ritmo enbolvente e hipnótico. 8/10<br />2- Another piece of meat: rock descarado y sin concesiones, con potentes riff de guitarra, totalmente recomendable. 7'5/10<br />3- Always somewhere: antes estuvieron &quot;In Trance&quot; y &quot;Fly people fly&quot;, pero el momento de las baladas puras y duras de Scorpions se abre con este tema totalmente pasional.  8/10<br />4- Coast to coast(instrumental): una pasada, guitarras peleonas, con un acompañamiento excelente, y desombocando en un sentimiento acongojante, en resumen acojonante.  9'5/10<br />5- Can't get enough: quiza el tema más pobre del album, y practicamente sin nada a destacar. 3/10<br />6- Is there anybady there?: estilo propio para una canción, entre el rock y el metal progresivo, que te gusta o no te gusta, asi de sencillo.  7/10<br />7- Lovedrive: OOOLLEE, impresionante, rock duro contagioso, magistral en todos sus matices, con un estribillo de los que gusta lucir a Meine.  8'5/10<br />8- Holidays: Mítico, Pasional, Aburrida, esta canción lo tiene todo. Empieza muy pausadamente, con un inicio de guitarra acústica monótono hasta la estenuación, pero cuando llegado a la mitad la balada se torna poderosa, se sufre lo que se podría llamar como un orgasmo musical. Esta fue sin duda la primera obra de arte de los Scorpions. 10/10
0064407667|3.0|As a bookseller, I've noticed kids are devouring the books of this series. Itching to see what the all the fuss is about, I picked up the first two. I'd heard the books were dark, but funny, and good for developing children's vocabulary, and, seeing the positive critical reviews, I'd recommend them to my customers. After having read the first two, I no longer recommend them. <br />The three Baudelaire children are orphaned after their parents perish in a fire. They are sent to live with a distant relative, Count Olaf, a diabolical miser who does little more than abuse the children and come up with ways to get his greedy hands on their inheritance. Olaf constantly threatens the children. He locks the infant girl in a birdcage and hangs it from his home's tower, hits the middle child, grazes a knife on the eldest girl's knee under the table during dinner, actually murders someone in the second book, and it goes on and on.<br />Yes, the books help develop vocabulary by using \\"big words\\" and phrases and explaining them. Yes, the Baudelaire children are sweet, resilient, and courageous. But I do not think that is enough to redeem these dark stories. All the adults are either wicked and cruel or completely obvlivious. What exactly is the moral of \\"The Bad Beginning\\"? That life [stinks] and there's nothing you can do about it and this theme continues in the second book, \\"The Reptile Room.\\"<br />I've noticed that a lot of adults enjoy the series and give it positive reviews, and that's why I gave the book three stars - because, on some level, I did enjoy the books somewhat for its subtleties, irony, and dark humor. However, the series is not intended for adults. It's written for and marketed towards children between 9 and 12 years of age. I'm not saying that kids' books should have a happy ending. There are hundreds of wonderful children's books out there that are dark and/or sad (i.e. Old Yeller, Charlotte's Web, Number the Stars), but there's usually a lesson, a moral, something redeeming in there. I failed to find any of these things in either of the first two books of this series.<br />What's most unfortunate about this \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\" is how many kids are reading it and how many parents are mistaking it for good childrens literature.
B00008AY3L|4.0|My favorite ben harper album has been 'fight for your mind' but I think that's being challenged with this new one. I thought ben got a little stale with his last few releases, falling into a tired formula that fell between souful wannabe and sell-out lenny kravitz. I've listened to the last few albums but never heard anything good enough to make me buy. This new album turns things around. He mixes styles gracefully and creates melodic, soulful songs. I strongly recommend this album. For those of you who have been frustrated with his last few albums, come on back. You'll want to own this album.
630542845X|1.0|I boy gets amazing powers. Does he use them for good? No he mopes around, complaining about how misunderstood he is! He needs a good kick in the pants!  For a much better movie that covers a lot of the same ground check out John Travolta in Phenomenom.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|I love music, but I'm not a music expert, and I rarely even spend money on CDs. But after I listened to 30 seconds of this CD in a record store when it first came out, and I couldnt get it out of my mind. I bought it a couple of months later, and it has been my favorite album ever since. <BR>The whole album is like a journey. The songs flow together seemlessly, recalling rhythms and lyrics from one song to the next. Some complain about his repeating the same melodies (also used on Clandestino), but I think its fantastic. Its like meeting a friend you havent seen in years- the same in some ways, not in others. Even within the same songs, the lyrics are simple and the songs seem almost repetetive. At first, I didnt know what to think of this style, but after listening a few times, it becomes hypnotic. <BR>For those who complained about a lack of 'meaningful' songs on this album, I can only assume that they didn't bother to find out what 'Denia' was about. Sung in Arabic, this song is about the troubles in Algeria. You don't have to understand Arabic to feel the passion and the hope for the future of &quot;poor Algeria&quot; in this song. <BR>At any rate, who says you have to be in-your-face with political statements to be meaningful? This album, by its design and content IS a political statement. <BR>On a personal level, I feel like this song was written just for me. English, Spanish, French, and Arabic are all spoken in my household - if one of us learns Portuguese we will actually understand all the lyrics! (I think- there may have been other languages in there that I missed..)In reality though, I think many many people these days live 'between cultures' - and this is one of the few albums around that truly breaks down false barriers of language and nationality. How refreshing to listen to music that is truly inclusive instead of exclusive! <br />Long story short: buy this album. You won't regret it.
B000084T18|3.0|Eminem's presence on this album may seem like a commercial ploy, but Em and 50 have true chemistry -- like a latter day Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.  Em is like kooky Bob and 50 is more the ultra-cool Bing.  If you like rap, you should listen to this at a friend's house but maybe not buy it.  But if you like old-fashioned entertainment, buy it!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|The Moulin Rouge Soundtrack has some great, unique hits! It has songs that are oldies-made new and are greater than ever! I love this soundtrack, although it does have a wierd twist, but who doesn't love something new? Nicole Kidman and Ewen McGregor sound fantastic together! You have to buy this soundtrack, it's one of my all-time favorites!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Loved this CD. Norah Jones' voice and musical phrasing as she sings are very seductive and dreamlike - perfect for slow dances and relaxing. You end up appreciating all the nuances of her songs: the lyrics, the musicianship, the very high production quality.<BR> <BR>Dear Grouchy Reviewer: Sounds like you got up on the wrong side of the bed! Jazz is a very open genre. I would suggest your definition is a little too closed and not at all reflective of the average musician's perception of jazz.<br />Also, Grouchy - Norah's father abandoned the family when she was a little girl, so she is understandably closer to her mother. Her father is East Indian, so I don't know where you got that comment about her rejecting her black history. You might want to check out the veracity of a story before you blast someone on a website.
0679882820|5.0|To those reviewers bashing the board book version, I say: get over it!  The board book version makes it possible to hold a squirming infant and read and turn the pages at the same time.  Accordingly, the baby is exposed to the process of reading at a time when it would otherwise be prohibitive.  My five month old loves this book, clearly tries to mimic the sounds of Mr. Brown, and smiles beyond belief as I loudly moo, whoo, buzz, and tick-tock.  I think above all else, Suess would want youngsters exposed to his works as early as possible, abridged or otherwise.
B00005ASOC|3.0|I am a high school student in thornton co. i thought that the movie was great. it had a good story and never viered off of the main subject. the movie had some real good points and made most of them clear. It showed how some people should stick up for one-an-other in hard or un fair times.<BR> i would recomend this movie to any one who likes great stories and a different stile of telling them. It kept me watching the whole time so hopfully it does the same for you.<br />Enjoy
0738203335|4.0|For those of you who have short attention spans, this book contains easily the most complete, detailed, researched, and clearly expounded history of Linux, the Free Software Foundation, the open source movement, the hacker ethic, and most everything else that has been going on with computer geeks since the 1950s. If you're at all interested by what's happening in the \\"free as in speech\\" technology sector, this book is a dramatic must-read. Go and pick it up now.<br />If you're still with me, however, this book is absolutely plagued by the disease known as \\"technical writing\\". It's long been known that those who deal with computers and electronics on a day-to-day (hour-to-hour?) basis are not often the most linguistically inclined individuals. This \\"urban legend\\" is manifested predominantly in the work, taking its form through constant usage errors, many spelling errors, excruciatingly awkward prose (at times), and, although this is more of a non-issue considering the subject matter, just a little too much bias in one direction.<br />Just to show that I'm not making this up, Glyn Moody frequently refers to \\"X Window\\", rather than \\"X Windows\\" (even though that's technically incorrect), \\"XFree86\\", \\"X11\\", or the \\"X Windowing System\\". Other similar, subtle annoyances occur throughout the book, but make no mistake: they don't obscure Moody's points indecipherably, they just annoy. One of the sentences that forced me to question Moody's bias was from Chapter 11: \\"If the history of Microsoft shows anything, it is a dogged determination to improve its often inadequate first attempts at writing software, and Internet Explorer is no exception.\\" This sentence, inserted just after describing Microsoft's assertions to the U.S. Department of Justice as \\"shameless\\", leaves the reader no choice but to second-guess Moody's intentions.<br />Is the book complete? Yes (at least, you won't find a more complete book around). Is the book perfect? No, and due to the frequency of grammaticaland otherwise editorial errors, I have to reduce my would-be 5-star rating to 4. Do yourself a favor and read this (but if Perseus would release a corrected second edition, that'd be just fine with me :D).<br />As a side note, I'm a user of Linux and a supporter of the open source model. When you do read this book, you'll be forced to form an opinion of your own on software patents and the whole lot. I encourage you not to take the RMS standpoint of \\"free [open] is better, always\\", nor do I encourage you to take the Bill Gates standpoint of \\"protected code is better, always\\". Draw a useful parallel between the two opinions.
B000075BFK|4.0|This 2 disc cd was pretty well done. I enjoyed the songs on the CD that showed 2pac's gangsta side and also the personal tracks.  The best song on this album is \\"still ballin\\" featuring trick daddy. I think that it was bad taste on the producers side to put out \\"f*** em' all\\" becuase it takes hits on the late biggie smalls, Nevertheless it has good beats. Good personal tracks include \\"mama's just a litle girl\\" and \\"Better Dayz\\". If you are a 2pac fan you must have this cd. But if you are not a true fan, just buy the greatet hits.
B000084T18|3.0|Although this was a solid effort from 50 cent, I think this album is slightly over hyped.  I will have to give it to 50 cent for staying true to his roots on this album though. It is rare that you find any true gangsta rap these days, in fact most rappers (with the exception of Dre,Snoop,and Eminem) are way to commercialized,and weak (i.e. Ja Rule). Overall this was a good album with some really hot tracks like &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot;, &quot;P.I.M.P&quot;, and &quot;Poor Lil Rich&quot;.
0790729369|5.0|I can not say enough about this movie. I enjoyed it so very much. It now tops my list of the best movies ever made.
B000002B2X|3.0|By now we all know this E.P. has five songs on it; not four.  And we all know this is the (first) place to find Alice In Chains' hit song \\"Got Me Wrong\\".  But what you may not know is that the two songs \\"Brother\\" and \\"Right Turn\\" (kudos Chris Cornell) are true Alice In Chains gems.  You'll look at those three songs (especially track #1) and say `wow'.  That I can almost promise you.  Along with Soundgarden's illustrious Cornell, \\"Right Turn\\" features infamous Mudhoney member Mark Arm; as they, along with Layne, move through the music flawlessly.  And Jerry Cantrell's guitar work on the first three tracks is some of best he has ever done.  However, the final two songs, \\"Am I Inside\\" and the untitled \\"Love Song\\" could very nearly be dubbed as flat-out bad.  \\"Am I Inside\\" is a modestly made song with no real basis for success.  And the hidden song is just horrible; I actually wish I'd never come across it.  On another down note, the sound quality of the CD isn't that great.  You may have to turn up your volume two or three notches to fully appreciate the music's melody.<br />In conclusion, you really only need this CD in your collection if you are a big Alice In Chains fan.  By now (for lesser fans) you can find \\"Got Me Wrong\\" on either the soundtrack to Clerks or hear its stellar unplugged version on Nothing Safe-The Best of the Box and/or Unplugged.  But \\"Brother\\" and \\"Right Turn\\" are definitely exceptional tracks; and deserve to be heard.  Yet you must understand Alice In Chains in order to welcome those songs into your hearts.  This five-song release gets 3 stars for each of its great songs.  I could've done without \\"Am I Inside\\" and certainly \\"Love Song\\"; but remember...take the bad with the good.
B00008AY3L|3.0|I'd never heard Ben Harper before I bought this CD but I heard him on a radio interview and I liked his personality so I thought I would give him a chance.  I dig the first tune.  It's a pretty fresh raggae sound and was blown away by the guitar work and soul sound of the second song.  Everything after that was decent but nothing spectacular.  It's like the songs weren't necessarily thrown together but just music that wasn't developed as well as the lyrics, which are decent.  After track two he lost me and the music fell background to my thoughts.  I heard a lick here and there and he has an amazingly distinct sound to his voice but the majority of the music on this disc is nothing special and actually does well at drawing your attention away from listening.  He lasted one rotation and I'll give it another play just to make sure I'm not missing anything and then I'm going to put JSBX back on and get down!
B00003CXXM|5.0|I rented this movie not long ago, and this movie made me stay in one position all the way through. This movie is mainly about a guy Jason Bourne(matt damon) who was rescued with two bullets in his back. After that Jason Bourne loses memory. He then has to find out his identity to save his life. As Jason Bourne is chased by killers he soon realises he to is an assasin.<br />This movie is full of great non stop action and many cool stunts and ideas. so yes this movie has some great ideas and stunts, and i have to say matt damon has sure trained for this breath taking non stop action movie. The only thing this movie could improve on like alot of the one star reviews said is the ending which i quite agree. All in all great movie, don't listen to the one star reviews and go rent it!!!
B00004R7TP|5.0|After the dark, but inconsistent [[ASIN:B000006MS3 The Dreaming]], Kate Bush moved onto what was truly a tale of a spiritual struggle with the marvellous and mysterious \\"Hounds Of Love\\". If [[ASIN:B000006MS3 The Dreaming]] was obsessed with evil powers and their workings, \\"Hounds Of Love\\" was truly a tale of a woman's spiritual experience. Moreover, Kate Bush never failed to be honest, yet mysterious about the portraits given, especially on the brilliant opener \\"Running Up That Hill\\" and the powerful, ecstatic rocker \\"The Big Sky\\", whose final outro remains the most entrancing moment in the history of music with its unique combination of instruments interlocking as if Kate and her band were entranced.<br /><br />In both these songs the melodic way in which the dense drumming of Stuart Elliott and Charlie Morgan blended with Alan Murphy's powerful guitar work was astonishing, and the title tune, dealing with a woman's troubles in childhood, was almost as brilliant, as was the haunting \\"Mother Stands For Comfort\\", a reflection on the evil within humanity.<br /><br />The second side, known as \\"The Ninth Wave\\" was the tale of a drowning woman and her experiences from drowning to rescue. Logically arranged, the songs on this side manage remarkably well to remain as songs rather than become confused. This could almost be seen as two works of art in one, so well was it done.<br /><br />\\"And Dream Of Sheep\\", referring to her initial mystic dream of a pastoral lifestyle in traditional rural England, possessed a remarkable beauty from the melodic whistles, and the synthesised strings of \\"Under Ice\\" possessed great dramatic power as we observe Kate discuss her disappearance under ice. \\"Waking the Witch\\" is a passionate confession, a \\"flower of evil\\" as Kate's precursor [[ASIN:1857549392 Baudelaire]] said, that really sounds like a genuine confession in the religious sense. \\"Watching You Without Me\\" was perhaps the most mysterious piece of all on an album of Sophianic mystery - one just does not know what is inside Bush's mind in her remote solitude symbolised by this song. \\"Hello Earth\\", highlighted by the line \\"get out of the waves, get out of the water\\", gave an almost apocalyptic tone to the mystical story on \\"The Ninth Wave\\". This is made even more intense by the use of Gregorian chant by the Richard Hickox Singers between more conventionally structured verses, though given a beautiful tone by Liam O'Flynn's amazing uillean pipes.<br /><br />The last track on the original album, \\"The Morning Fog\\" symbolised a return to the world by the drowning woman and was the most accessible piece on the whole record. The bonus tracks (except for the ridiculous extended mix of the amazing \\"The Big Sky\\" that turns mystical ecstasy into unlistenable noise) fit in very well with the album's mysterious, almost apocalyptic tone, notably with the line \\"you and me against the world\\" of \\"Burning Bridge\\".<br /><br />\\"Hounds Of Love\\", as symbolised by the purple on its cover, was and is an amazing tale of spiritual wisdom, a confession in a langauge of pure symbolism that is both amazingly ancient and totally modern, totally personal yet cosmic in its breath.what is inside Bush's mind in her remote solitude symbolised by this song. \\"Hello Earth\\", highlighted by the line \\"get out of the waves, get out of the water\\", gave an almost apocalyptic tone to the mystical story on \\"The Ninth Wave\\".

B00006RU5B|5.0|If you are a zeppelin fan this album is a must have.  Cochise and Set it Off could easily be mistaken as songs by zeppelin.  I Am The Highway is one of my favorite songs on this cd.  There are no skip over tracks.  From beginning to end this cd exhibits musical brillance.
B00003CXI1|5.0|For those who doesn´t know (a think there will be very few people) Harry potter tells the story about a boy ,who lives with his uncles and at his 11 birthday, is told that he will become a great wizard just as his parents were. From that point and on, the adventure begins....<br />We are witness of the magical enviroment harry is living. As he said, he´s home. And that home involves 3 head dogs, owls who deliver the post, moving newspaper pictures, a football-kindof game on brooms, and on and on... <br />It contains all the elments from the book! Even most of the dialogs are loyal to the book.<br />This may not be the best movie ever, but for those who enjoys a great movie with a lot of innocence and adventure, without any war , disasters, or any other sad event, this is a must buy. <br />One fact that i find very interesting is that the harry potter book series had brought back the reading habit for a lot of people , especially the youngs. In a world where Playstation and nintendo rules, it´s grateful to know that a story so simple and entertain could steal some fans from the tv screen´s. That could fight any bad review from any critic.... besides, is a great DVD: the movie has excelent john williams´ music, great performances from british actors who portrays the teachers, a lot of features, deleted scenes, a tour to howarts school, etc.<br />One thing is for sure, you won´t regret buy this one. Follow the saga and you´ll know is worth it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|If you are a zeppelin fan this cd is a must have. Cochise and Set It Off could easily be misken as songs by Led Zeppelin.  My favorite song on this cd is I Am The Highway.  There are no skip over tracks.  This cd is a necessary addition to every rock lover's cd collection.
0316666343|1.0|The first several chapters deserve five stars. With more time and effort, perhaps the rest of the book would have worked out to something more satisfying.  The characters became stick figures and the plot points ridiculous. A good editor would have helped.
B00008AY3L|5.0|The amazon.com reviewer was fairly dead on. This album is ridiculously diverse, but still sounds like Ben Harper. And in an era when bands like Creed and Nickleback are releasing the same albums of glugging 4-chord, minor-keyed, talentless Pearl Jam covers it is quite refreshing to hear an album as diverse as this one. <br />Kicking things off with the upbeat reggae of \\"With My Own Two Hands\\" the album provides a totally new feel. While it may not be his best lyrical work the song is fun, and has a good, if somewhat cliched, message. Thumping bass drum and slide guitar blues harken back to Ben's roots in \\"When It's Good\\". The title track is an acoustic rocker with a bluesy country feel that is one of the most solid tunes on the album. With \\"Touch from Your Lust\\" Ben really hits his stride on both musical and lyrical fronts as this tune proves to be the real diamond in the rough here. \\"When She Believes\\" is an accordian-drenched, lilting tune that is perhaps a little too lush on this disc. It's one of the tunes you'd like to hear stripped down to Ben's voice and an acoustic guitar, but we'll have to wait for that. \\"Brown Eyed Blues\\" is the better of the two funk charts on the album, neither of which are truely remarkable, but both of which provide a nice change of pace. \\"Bring The Funk\\" however lacks either lyrical prowess or energy depending on how you look at it, though its still a good tune. \\"Amen Omen\\" is another more traditional Ben Harper tune featuring a lot of acoustic guitar, and great lyrics. \\"Temporary Remedy\\" and \\"So High So Low\\" both show off the power Ben packed into his last studio album \\"Burn To Shine\\", with the latter opening with a quiet acoustic guitar interlude before blasting power chords with Ben's screaming vocals. The Innocent Criminals, and in particular the percussion section take center stage (Juan Nelson already having proven his worth on bass in the funk section) for the two African-tinged tunes \\"Blessed to be a Witness\\" and \\"Picture of Jesus\\". The spirituality in the lyrics adds to it, and the music is just so diverse that it really is nice to hear. The album closes with \\"She's Only Happy in the Sun\\" an acoustic masterpiece showcasing Ben's beautiful voice and pensive lyric writing ability.<br />All in all this is one of the most diverse albums you could ever hope to own, reading more like a library of tracks rather than an album by one artist. Yet it still maintains some semblance of cohesion, and what it lacks in that department it makes up for in the talent and breadth of Harper's songwriting skills. Surprisingly the lack of his acoustic slide guitar prowess is not even missed, but with this repetoire of material, how could you?

B00008RH3L|5.0|Finally!  I've been waiting for Miller's Crossing to come out on DVD since the day I got my first DVD player.  I can't say enough good things about this movie.  Gabriel Byrne is a stoic button-man for the Irish mob in this Coen brothers classic.  He is placed in a series of comprimising circumstances that test his loyalties to his boss, his woman, and his honor.  John Turturro, ALbert Finney, and Jon Polito all play great supporting roles that really flesh out this unsung gem of a movie. <br />It is rare to find a \\"gangter\\" (not gangsta) film that has more to do with the characters than with planning out hits.  The closest comparison to Miller's Crossing that I can think of from recent years is Road to Perdition, but this movie does not have the at times over the top, \\"sons are put on Earth to trouble their fathers- I love you son\\" melodrama I tasted in that movie.  Miller's Crossing is more about Gabriel Byrne's quiet portrayal of a man who will do what he feels he must--at any cost to others or himself.<br />Long story short, if you liked The Godfather movies, Road to Perdition, or Carlito's Way...full speed ahead, buy this movie.  If you are a fan of Coen brothers movies, and you're wondering if their early movies are as good as their later movies--yes, they are; give this one a try.

B000089CJI|3.0|If you are a fan of electronica (Aphex Twin, Photek, that kinda stuff) forget it, you're not gonna like this album.  The samples are disappointing for Photek fans.  Emo fans get a slight thrill off of the beats and are happy with the lyrics and singing.  Overall, the album has some songs that I really like and some that are kind of bland.  You can't say this is emo because of the lack of guitars etc.  but you can't say its techno because of the lack of sufficient beats and samples.

B000089RVX|5.0|In Europe there is a healthy scene of dark, emotional metal bands that feature female singers. It started with Holland's The Gathering and also features great bands such as Lacuna Coil from Italy, Finland's Lullacry, as well as bands like Flowing Tears, Within Temptation, Theater of Tragedy, and Nightwish. Now with their album &quot;Fallen,&quot; Evanescence becomes the first American band to wave the flag of dark, beautiful heaviness. With their ascent to stardom, I hope that some of the European bands will finally get some much diserved recognition. <BR>     Musically, the band sounds similar to Linkin Park, with its crisp, slightly electronic crunch. Add to that singer Amy Lee who has a very similar style and sense of melody as The Gathering's Anneke Von Giersbergen. All the heavier songs groove quite well, but the ballads, especially &quot;My Immortal&quot; will make even the hardest headbanger misty-eyed! <BR>     If you happen to be a fan of any of the bands I mentioned above, you will find a worthy new addition to your collection. If you have never heard of bands like The Gathering or Lacuna Coil and you love Evanescence, go right now, do nothing else, go buy &quot;Mandylion&quot; and &quot;Nighttime Birds&quot; by the Gathering and &quot;Comalies&quot; and &quot;In a Reverie&quot; by Lacuna Coil. You will thank me, and your life will be a little better for also having these CDs.
B00005JLXC|1.0|Worst movie I've seen in years!  I can't beleive people actually liked it.  I went with my husband and friend on opening night and we all thought it stunk.  I'm not really that familiar w/the commic and didn't really know the concept behind Daredevil so when I realized that the Daredevil was a blind man I just could not get into it.  In fact, I just laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of it all.  Ben Aflact was unconvincing as a super hero and the dialogue was pathetic.  Even Jennifer Garner couldn't sell it and she sells it every Sunday night on Alias.<br />Beter than Spiderman, I really don't think so....
B000002JSV|5.0|This is the greatest album you never heard of. Recently in a Boston Globe interview - Angus and Malcolm both stated that &quot;Powerage&quot; was AC/DC's best album, and I cannot agree more.<BR>Not really the heavy metal feel of the two albums that came after this (Highway 2 Hell and Back In Black, respectively). Think more of it as hard rock meets Chuck Berry. All the songs are terrific - my personal favs are &quot;Gimme A Bullet - What's Next to the Moon - Kicked In the Teeth.&quot;<br />Do yourself a favor - get this album/CD now!
B00005LK95|5.0|Short Circuit 2 is a hollywood triumph. The first one was good, but this is one of the rarities in the world of sequels that is not just as good as the original, it's better! It's got everything that every other sequel should;<BR>He comes to New York and starts building miniature models of himself. <BR>Helps his friend/creator guy with his love life by controlling an electronic sign. <BR>Accidentally helps jewel thieves tunnel into a bank. <BR>And is the first hang-gliding robot in movie history. <br />What's not to like? There will never ever be a movie quite like Short Circuit 2. It's funny, dramatic, action-packed (complete with car chase), and of course, heartwarming...
0316666343|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much! I bought it in the airport and was almost done by the time my plane landed 4 hours later. I couldn't put it down. Presents a very interesting perspective on the afterlife. Highly recommend.
B000000HU1|5.0|You comprises part III of the Radio Gnome Invisible Trilogy and is the most focused Allen-era piece of music Gong ever produced (and perhaps the most enjoyable!).  The influence of Daevid Allen is virtually absent from this album and as a result nearly all of the songs are instrumental, with only the briefest vocal parts. Much of the music on You is spacey and synthesiser led, with technically superior drumming from Pierre Moerlen, virtuosic guitar work from Steve Hillage, and rumbling bass playing from Mike Howlett.  Some of the highlights include: A Sprinkling of Clouds, Master Builder, and The Isle of Everywhere.  This album is very highly recommended along with Fish Rising (1975) by Steve Hillage.
B00005JLEU|5.0|While Major Hollywood studios believe the audiences are tired of watching plain hand-drawn cartoons and began to incorporate more special effects into 2-D animation, yet with disappointing results (Titan A.E., Atlantis, and the most recent Treasure Planet), they have almost totally given up on traditional animation, and focus on producing 3-D computer animation. After a series of successful and charming CG cartoon, one could not help but to wonder: is this the end of hand-drawn cartoon artists? (some may argue that they could get the job as storyboard artists)<br />The point that they are really missing is, what is missing from the recent 2-D animation features, is not the blasting visual effects, or floor cracking sounds. The real thing that is missing from them is a \\"heart\\". <br />See \\"Toy Story\\", \\"A Bug's Life\\", and \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" (all produced by Pixar Studio, who is, in the writer's opinion, superior than their rival competitors), while they are indeed visually revolutionary, the focus is still on story telling - story that combines humor, excitement, and ultimately family-oriented heart-warming theme.<br />\\"Spirited Away\\" is simply magical, enchanting, funny, and genuinely touching. In the beginning of the film some may be distracted by the in comparison lower frame-rate (i.e. the character movements may not seem as smooth compare to the Hollywood animations), but you will not be able to help but to awe at each beautifully rendered frame. The artistic level and the use of colors in the drawing are all first class. Moreover, 30 minutes into the film, you will probably forget it is drawings that you are watching, because everything inside the screen all comes alive! (Perhaps because it reaches a certain realistic level, some of the scene may be too grizzly and scary)<br />It did not become the highest grossing movie in Japan ever for no reason, and it certainly deserves more attention it received in the western world. The ballroom scene in \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" never fails to bring tears in my eyes, and it reminds us why we watch cartoon in the beginning. \\"Spirited Away\\" achieves in the same way, and it achieves it like a breeze among all these competitions today.
0780622553|5.0|When I watched this movie, I couldn't help but see the similarities with the Matrix. John Murdock wakes up and he can't remember who he is. A caller warns him that people are looking for him and that he should run. It turns out that he's special... can influence &quot;the machine&quot; with his mind. He discovers that his memories have been influenced by &quot;the strangers&quot; and reality is not what he thought it to be. <br />Sound familiar??? <br />This movie is worth having in your collection, and at the least deserves a spin courtesy of your local video store. This movie is a race from the very beginning and it not only foreshadows the Matrix, it recalls a little bit of Total Recall. If Blade Runner, Matrix, and 12 Monkeys are your type of movies...this is a must see.
B00005ATQD|5.0|This was the first Kubrick's film I have ever watched, and ever since I have become a great admirer of the great late director. <br />Many people I have talked to expecting to see a epic about nude-fest orgy party. They came out spitting on the poster. I waited until it came out on DVD to see what the fuss was all about, rented it, rented it again, and purchased it. <br />The story did not matter to me, though it did creep into my mind and stayed months after. What stroke me was the rich imagery, and the precise framing of every single second of the film. The music, the production, even the performances Kubrick squeezed out of Cruise and Kidman just left me utterly stunned. I admit the film is flawed, and it does feel hallow at times, and the orgy party is indeed disturbing as intended. But I will be forever grateful that \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" opened my eyes to see a true master at work.
B000069HP6|2.0|When I picked up The Black Hole recently, I was very excited. I remembered enjoying this movie very much when it first came out. After watching this movie now with my 11 year old son, I couldn't help but scratch my head and wonder what exactly I liked about it. The special effects, for its time, are very good. The bad robot was creepy and the story, overall, was interesting if not overly predictable.<br />What bothers me about this movie is the complete lack of originality, except for the last few minutes. Cute little robots, one with a cowboy accent (built in Texas of course), large android-like soldiers (bad of course), all steal (not borrow) from Star Wars. Disney had such a chance to make a unique film, especially with the money they spent, and instead made an overtly derivative film with uninteresting and equally derivative characters.<br />There are some redeeming qualities - the concept behind the crew of the derelict ship, with their mirrored faces, and who they really are, the fine acting by Schell, but even his role was every old-scientist-gone-mad-on-deserted-planet character from 50's B-movies. The ending (last 5 minutes ONLY) was clever, but HOW they ended up there was just more unbelievable plot turns.<br />In general I love movies, and give them leniency when I can, but I can't with this one.  As far as my 11-year old, in his words \\"It was OK, I guess.\\" Pretty damning something that lackluster from someone his age.
B000002J1S|5.0|Genesis' \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" is an album I heard about many times.  I heard it was one of the best concept albums ever.  Well, it's damn good, that's for sure.  But, for one thing, it was eternally hard to get into (I got it for Christmas and I've just recently gotten really into it).  Also, it's quite different from their album \\"Selling England By The Pound\\", which I recommend over this one, at least to start with.<br />Well, this is a pretty weird album.  The story is pretty hard to decipher exactly, but with Peter Gabriel's explanation, I'm starting to get it.  Reviewers who have said stuff like \\"not for the faint hearted\\" and that sometimes this album can be quite frightening are absolutely right.  The thing that brings this down to 4 stars for me is that some of the songs just don't do much for me.  Mainly on the second disc.  There are many memorable songs and great moments, but some that probably should have been left off.  Anyways, with that behind me, I shall now describe some tracks I like...<br />The title track starts the album off with some good rock'n'roll.  This track introduces the main character with a memorable musical theme, which comes back later.  \\"In the Cage\\" is one of the more frightening numbers, both lyrically and musically.  \\"Back in NYC\\" showcases the band's instrumental prowess.  \\"Hairless Heart\\" is a moody instrumental which leads into \\"Counting Out Time\\", a great pop/rock song.  \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" is perhaps the biggest highlight of the first disc.  A mellow, yet powerful song.  \\"You've gotta get in to get out...\\".  Wow.  Gives me chills every time.  Finally, \\"The Light Lies Down on Broadway\\" brings back that main theme, only a bit different.  Another chilling moment.  \\"It\\" is kind of a weird song to close the album with, (personally, I would have let it end after \\"The Light Dies Down..\\" but I guess lyrically that wouldn't work), but I like it.<br />One thing I was surprised about was Phil Collins.  You may have heard him singing pop songs in the 80's, but damn, this guy can play drums, man!  It's great to hear his true talent.  <br />I don't really know whether or not to recommend this.  Obviously, if you like prog-rock you should consider getting it, but it can be a bit much at times.  For this band, I would definitely recommend \\"Selling England...\\" prior to this one.
1583900101|5.0|This is a beautifully presented and edited volume. The novel is a classic, and it is here edited by one of the greatest American scholars in her field, Susan Wolfson. Not to be missed.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|The first time I heard \\"All the Things She Said\\" on the radio, I was hooked. I couldn't get that song out of my head. So every time I was in my car, I was hunting through the stations madly trying to find it again. Then, I decided that song alone was worth a purchase of this CD. And I was pleasantly surprised to find an album full of songs so catchy that you will be dancing furiously when you are listening to them and humming them constantly when you aren't. On top of the 8 or so original songs, you get a couple interesting Russian versions and even better, a music video AND an interesting behind-the-scenes look.<br />What else can I say? The duet are sexy Russian lesbians(this alone will gather much attention and interest from the guys) with pretty voices and beautiful, melodic tunes. I look to T.A.T.U's future with much interest. Don't miss this album! It's so much better than most of the ... out there.
B00005JLXC|5.0|All I want to say about Daredevil was that it was a fun hour and 40 minutes. I'm a DD fan and I had my reservations about this movie going in, and especially after the first 20 minutes which I think went by a bit slow. But once this movie got itself into the main plot with all the DD character staples it was just great. The movie went by in no time and I found myself wanting to see it again, which is abnormal for me. While it may not be as good as Spider-man, if only for its slow beginning, this film is easily one of the most fun I've seen for a long time.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I absolutely love this film because the object of the movie is the MUSICAL GENIUS  who never will be arased from the history........ Magical Mozart who is getting bigger and bigger than life..... who looked as compete idiot in  his present life.........his choice of the wife does not sounds so admiravle as well... But his  misic !!!!!1111 It is belongs to infiity as weel to eterity...... How is the nature could be so tricky and  so sloopy???? I looked at Mozart's  manusrips of his musicals  scores, they loked as so perfect as God was dictating music to his ears as well  his hadwritings has no marks, he had not a one hesitation in his creativity. Imagine this man was burried in the public grave??????? Please, God justify  the Your creation !!!!!!!!!!!!!    We love Mozart music so much that  we we can  be patient and we will find him.... DNA or not..............Please, the times reveal your   secret!!!!!!!!!!
B000002SE0|5.0|This is a good recording of Puccini's posthumous opera Turandot.<BR>Francesco Molinari-Pradelli picks up a great cast with great voices. You've got to see the notes that Renata Scotto, as Liu sings in Signore Ascolta, or the great voice of Franco Corelli, as Calaf with Non Piangere Liu,they are excellent. And Birgit Nilsson who sings In Questa Reggia, quite interesting to play the lead role of Turandot. Nessun Dorma is good too! Next to Luciano Pavarotti's rendition of it this Nessun Dorma sung by Corelli is just as good. I love this recording, the only problem I have with it is it's not a really complete one. If I find either the ones with Herbert Von Karajan or Lorin Maazel, I'd sure love to have them.<BR>Otherwise this is a super-sensational Turandot.
B00006690G|5.0|...The best songs on this CD include White America, Cleaning Out My Closet, Business, Square Dance, Sing for the Moment, and Without Me.  They should have ended the CD earlier because the last few songs are not nearly as good as what came earlier.  However, this is a great CD overall and further proof that Eminem (and Dr. Dre and his team) has got the skills and will be around for a long time to come (as long as he wants to).
0553213105|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!! Personally I am very picky about books. And in order to get on my favorites list it has to be exeptional. And trust me this book definatly was!! The story is told from the point of Elizabeth, who is the second oldest daughter of the Bennet family. She shows awsome analytical skills, but as the story continues you realize that there has been a prejudice made in the story. And you also realize how you, yourself got outsmarted &amp; realize you made a huge prejudice too. This story is happening in a setting of old England. Whith balls, &amp; horse drawn carriges &amp; the ladies only wear dresses. It is a wonderful story of romance &amp; life in general. But always very entertaining. I recommend this book to everyone!
B00003CXXM|4.0|I saw the original and was impressed with the story line....the remake is smart and full of action...and this is from a woman that usually doesn't enjoy remakes !

B00005RFAI|3.0|Pink does not get nearly enough attention for her talents.She's on of the best talents to come around in many years.She's got a raspy,strong,beautiful voice and is capable of carrying of many emotions.I got the chance to see her live a year ago, and I just have to say that she's unbelevable.She's got a hell of a big of a future ahead of her.She also co-writes most of her music, and produces, and I respect that.Having said that, I'll say that what Pink desperately needs to do is abandon any pretenses she has at courting the young adult market.She needs to abandon pop.She needs to work on her lyrical abilities, because while lyrically this disc has a few good moments, there are many moments which are just downright embarassing.She's not that deep.Maybe at first,compared to other pop stars, but really she's not.She also needs to dump this \\"tough\\" chick persona, which she holds up on tracks like \\"don't let me get me\\".She also needs to let her songs have more melodic power, because at the moment she's trying wayyyyyyyy too hard to have center around catchy hooks and choruses, but if you strip down the songs, there's not much there.If Pink completely abandons all these pretenses, and does what I KNOW she is fully capable of doing someday soon, she will be an artist worth watching.If you want to hear her potential, listen to tracks like \\"Eventually\\", and the wow-ing duet with Steven Tyler \\"Misery\\".But, other than that, a lot of this really screams with marketing ploy.I'm lookin' out for this one, cause she's got it.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|When someone says \\"Cinderella,\\" you think of a young girl who's father dies, leaving her with an evil step mother and 2 step sisters. She gets a fairy godmother and goes off to marry a prince. Umm..well, you're going to be in for a surprise. Ever After has absolutely none of that hocus-pocus fairy godmother stuff. It's realistic, and could actually happen. And you'll love the fact that Cinderella (Danielle), isn't going to wait around for fairy godmother. She's got smarts, and is going to use it.
B0000042GM|5.0|Although I don't consider myself an &quot;expert&quot; of classical music, I do listen to alot of it and own over 500 classical cd's.  Out of my entire collection, if I had to throw away 499 of them and only keep one, I'd keep this box set.  Katchen plays so beautifully that I lose myself in the music every time and never get tired of listening to it.<br />If you are considering buying this and are reading the reviews for informaton, don't hesitate - buy it NOW!  You won't regret it.
B0000844I8|2.0|Though this film went on to spawn a series.  I was never impressed by it.  I thought it was dumb with so many glossing over historical inaccuracies and inherent racism that I was offended by the film.    I like Kurt Russell as an actor and I worry abotu James Spader findign credible roles for his acting ability but this film is really bad and unfair to the historical truths of what races would look like.  Like a Woody Allen film, it glaringly tries to removes people of color to make it more marketable and gentler.
B00005JLSC|5.0|What Rob Marshall did in bringing to life what seemed whimsically ancient and dead (the flashy Broadway musical to film) was nothing less then sheer brilliance.<br />From the first few moments of Chicago, in a swanky, upper class booze soaked cabaret, one feels transported to the sexy times in beautiful technicolor: the roaring twenties.  <br />What sets the mood for Chicago: All that Jazz.  Arriving from the floor to belt out a thrilling number, Catherine Zeta-Jones is the best thing about the film, as a vampish, gorgeouss, voluptious murderess.  Out of all the Velma Kelly's potrayed throughout Chicago's life on stage and screen Catherine Zeta-Jones takes the cake.<br />The meticulous, wonderful cheoreography in All that Jazz is what makes it my favorite number, but it's hard to pick.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for the signature song.<br />Beautifully, Chicago tells the story of Roxie Hart, a floozy turned celebrity by murder.  <br />Through an array of spectacular songs, Chicago makes it clear that it's the best film of 2003. <br />The corruption of the media, the public, the world is shown clear here, but in a very witty, sarcastic (if not synical way).  In the last number, Roxie and Velma wittily take to the stage with fake guns, which can be the evidence to this point.<br />There is not one \\"star\\" of Chicago.  There are infact countless.  The costumes, sets, creativity, and lighting is enough to blow ones visual sences away.  However, the sheer talent through the characters brings the movie to life.<br />Renee Zellweger is fantastic.  There is no one else I can imagine in the role of Roxie.  Richard Gere is very good, and who knew he could belt out a tune with style?  Queen Latifah and John C. Reily shine as signature supporting roles, and there numbers are some of the best in the film.  But they all dont add up to Catherine, who is sheer brilliance.  Her three big numbers are my favortes (All that Jazz, Cell Block Tango, and I Can't do it Alone), and not to mention she is one of the most beautiful and talented women in Hollywood.<br />But the biggest star of Chicago is Rob Marshall, whose impeccable strength and creativity shined through in the thrilling direction and cheoreography of Chicago.<br />Even for the non-musical person, Chicago is something to see.  It's dark, dirty, fantastic, and stunning.  The best film of 2003.
6304140428|5.0|Why do I love a film about vicious dysfunctional alcoholics?  It's like going home!  Also I love the language of thsi film, the acting and the constant push of characters playing a game within a game.  The art of the work is the language and timing.  I'm not sure if some things can ever be resatged or refilmed with other actors because what also makes this work is the baggae of Taylor and Burton together.  This isn't simply a work aside from actor, this is a farscape view into what these people may or may not have felt inklings of for each other.<BR>George Segal and Sandy Dennis are great here too as unwitting pawns and weapons in the war between George and Martha, though Dennis is used more as a pawn who may or may not understand her position and Segal gets a chance to skewer and attack back.<BR>I love the language and written heart of this woprk in particular for one reason.  It goes for the jugular, to slit a vein open in this amazingly dysfunctional lifestyle and couple.  Black and white only highlights the starkness of their feeling for each other and lovign hatred.  They remind me of Nick and Jessica in twenty years.  Sick and twisted.

B00003CX9Q|3.0|I've never seen this movie before.  I was going to see it when it was re-released into theaters but I missed it.  So I do know that Debra Winger is ET's voice and that ET is an alien who gets lost on Earth.  Isn't that simply amazing?  I'm gonna watch this film again and then re-edit my review to add new impressions.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Every once and a while movie is made that is so unique and so good that it lives you speechless. American beauty is definitely one of these rare films.<br />You are invited into lives of Lester and Carolyn Burnham, a seemingly ordinary couple in a suburban neighborhood. Movie slowly unravels their lives and lives of those around them.<br />A true underachiever, Lester movies from one day into next as a complete zombie and strives for life with the least amount of responsibilities. Spending most of his days in dreamland, the object of his obsession becomes his teenage daughter's classmate. His overachieving and superficial wife Carolyn on the other hand lives with one philosophy: \\"In order to be successful, you must project the image of success at all times\\" (no matter what you might feel). Their daughter is a typical teenager who hates everything about her life including mom and dad. Her boyfriend - a new neighbor, drug dealing filmmaker whose only obsession is death.<br />Excellent performances, brilliant writing by Allen Ball and exquisite visuals places this movie among the best.
B00005NTN5|5.0|This is what I'm talking about.  A film that has smart characters, so smart that you aren't sure that even YOU know what they will and wil not do, along with an acceptance of sexuality that it secondary to the plot.  This movie could've been played by a man and a woman, two men, whatever, the point is that when opportunity knocks teh important thing is to be in tune enough with yourself to fling yourself into it.<br />Jennifer Tilly is somewhere between hilarious and chilling as a woman who may or may not be a ditz, a bimbo, a conniver, a liar, a fool, depending upon how SHE decides and Gina Gershon plays a lesbian who thinks she's closed off to the seduction game, only to be seduced.<br />In the end I was even sure whether Gershon represented love to Tilly's character or simply the best opportunity.<br />A priceless gem of a movie.
B00005CDNK|5.0|I especially like the song soldiers b/c it is upbeat and has a good rythim
B00006690G|4.0|This is a really good cd. I am a fan of eminem's music and I think this is his best cd so far because the cd has a variety of music. Some songs like \\"Cleanin Out My Closet \\" show anger and disgust, and other songs are more upbeat like  \\"Without Me\\". Em's songs are unique and brutally honest at times. What makes this cd so good to me is that it has alot of great songs such as \\"Business\\", \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\", \\"Sing for the Moment\\",\\"Without Me\\", \\"Hailey's Song\\", and \\"Superman\\". Dr. Dre is a good rapper and also a good producer. Eminem's songs are very controversial, and arise alot of debate. But, if you listen hard to the lyrics in almost every song their is a message. Although I think Eminem is a good rapper, his songs do  have alot of cursing in them, and are probably not suitable for kids under 13. That is the only real reason that I give this album 4 stars instead of 5, because sometimes the cursing doesn't seem necessary. And also some songs are just plain ..., such as \\"Drips\\". So in conclusion, I do recommend this album strongly to people 13 and over due to very strong language (That's why there's a PARENTAL ADVISORY sticker, it's not for decoration. So get it edited if you're under 13 and like eminem's music. Nuff said. PEACE
B00000JPYD|5.0|Here it is. An album that sold over three million copies without a single after its release in the early 70's. Every song showcases Robin's great song writing and guitar playing. As a guitar-hero aficionado, he is my number one. I was privileged to see him play live here in Oz in the mid-70's. I was stoked to see him whilst playing a huge solo during 'Too Rolling Stoned', eyes still closed, step up to his microphone and tell an idiot in the audience who kept yelling \\"give it to us Jimmy\\" to \\"[edit] Off\\". This man is one of the [unsung] greats! Hey, so was Jimmy. Thankfully God spared one of the two greatest so that we can be overjoyed at hearing more original work and wonder whether we'll ever see him on our shores again....I hope and prayer that he graces us again. Long live Robin.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a wonderful series for anyone, but in particular those of us who were not around at that time and want to know what those poor boys went through. From what I have heard, this is pretty realistic. Excellent acting and a wonderful recreation of that place in time. I would highly recommend this miniseries!!!
B00005QGAX|5.0|This album is a classic, with some ground-breaking sounds. There is just so much creativity and heart in MJ's songs. I liked the special edition booklet with the pictures and lyrics. Glad MJ released this, especially the bonus tracks. To me, Streetwalker should-ve been on the album. It has a wonderful groove that gets stuck in your head! Other than that, my favorite tracks are Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, Another Part of Me, Man In The Mirror, Dirty Diana, and Leave Me Alone. Just Good Friends is a good duet. One the interviews with Quincey Jones, he talked about how Prince was supposed to do the video for \\"Bad\\" with MJ. That would have been so cool. 5 Stars!!![.]
B000001FAW|4.0|... This record was one of my first purchases as a teenager and in spite of some of my changing tastes in music, I still always appreciated the harmonies of the Gibb Brothers and the spunky instrumental support.<br />Many good quality songs on here as it is indeed hard to choose a favorite.  I guess that I would lean towards Boogie Child with its spunky guitars and captivating melodies.  However I really appreciate the shear beauty of ballads like Love Me and The Way It Was.  Those numbers are sung with so much emotion.  Also Can't Keep A Good Man Down has some real spunky guitar fills.<br />Truthfully I prefer this recording to the somewaht overhyped Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack.  Its a bit more mainstream.  Anyway, this is very suitable for many audiences.
B00008977N|3.0|I won't delve into the concert performance on this DVD, since it's been out on VHS tape for many years, except to briefly state the concert itself is fantastic. Instead, I'd like to comment on the qualities of the DVD itself.<br /> First off, the DVD's four added features, though not groundbreaking, certianly take advantage of the format. A timelapse of the stage being set up, a 'making of SWL' segment, a remixed version of &quot;Steam&quot; set to tour photos, and a glimpse of Peter's most recent &quot;Up&quot; tour, all give added value to the presentation.  <br /> As to the DVD itself, the DTS 5.1 sound mix is the best I've ever heard. I had seen this concert tour at Madison Square Garden and am happy to say this sounds just like being there. The seperation in the mix is perfect, placing Gabriel's vocals right up front. Tony Levin's bass will give your sub-woofer a workout, Manu Katche's drums are crisp and clean, David Rhode's guitar never gets lost, and the keyboards are mixed just slightly to the background. Background vocals and other instruments are always subtly there. Also, there appear to be no overdubs, you are watching and listening to the same performance. This is not something all concert videos can claim. All in all, a perfect example of how a live 5.1 channel recording should be.<br /> On the other hand, the picture quality is another story. My DVD player is hooked up to a widescreen digital tv using component-out connections. Unfortunately, the picture is so grainy it becomes distracting, bordering on unwatchable. At first I thought the DVD was defective, but the bonus material does not have this graininess. I do not know if this is a result of the film being transferred digitally to widescreen, but if this is the case, I would prefer a regular fullscreen analog version. I have the Pearl Jam &quot;Touring Band 2000&quot; DVD, which has a slight graininess to it, however this gives it a certain raw feel that suits a live Pearl Jam concert. In the case of &quot;Secret World Live&quot; it is a disaster.      <br /> Someone out there will say I'm too picky about the picture, but with the all the hoopla about the 16:9 anamorphic widescreen digital transfer, I am dissapointed. Half of me wants to scream 'this is the best concert DVD ever', and half of me just wants to scream. Geffen Records certianly owes an explanation for the very poor video quality.
B00000DCH9|4.0|Whether its a touching ballad like You're My Home or a rollicking piece such as Travelin' Prayer, I really can appreciate the keyboard stylings of Billy Joel.  In addition, each piece has some incredible arrangements and lyrics.  The words just tell great stories.  The Ballad of Billy The Kid is a perfect example of an old Western Tale.  Other songs like Captain Jack deal nicely with the realities of growing up.<br />Whereas I prefer Turnstiles more than Piano Man, I still seem to appreciate this recording as well as Streetlife Serendader and Cold Spring Harbor on a special level.  Billy Joel styling's in the early days were not as rooted in Top 40 trends.  Don't get me wrong, I like many of Billy Joel's more commercial releases too.  However there seems to be a certain innocence in Billy's early recordings and this Piano Man record stands tall in that area.
0060977264|4.0|I received this book as a gift from a friend of mine, who told me it would teach me what love is like.  I have since read it several times over; it is truly phenomenal.  The plot is simple but original, the prose elegant and beautiful, and the lessons on love, religion, and following one's dreams are indispensible.
6305177473|5.0|For anyone who doesn't think they'll like the movie because they did't like the old one, think again.  It's the best movie on earth, with very modern updates from the first film starring Haylie Mills.  It also has more than a few clever twists that make this movie great.  The to-be \\"evil\\" stepmother, a woman named Meredith, had quite a few hilarious habits and a few scenes, one involving a lizard in her mouth and the other wih her air matress floating the middle of a lake make it extrmely funn and a great movie for kids and adults.
B00000I78Y|2.0|So,<br />The theory is still true; if you aim low enough you will hit the mark when it comes to music. SOAD, as the middle schoolers like to call them, is seriously over rated. It's fairly easy to be &quot;totally awesome&quot; to a bunch of teenagers who are just now in their lives discovering cigarettes and coffee, so blowing them away is not a tough trick. I remember when I was in college and the Thompson Twins got the same kind of &quot;rave inspirational reviews&quot; from the kids...<br />This thing too will pass, like a beer fart.<br />One point to be clear on is, this CD is worth hearing for several reasons, none of which are covered in any of the teeny-bopper 5 star reviews. I'll leave it up to you.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is one of the most incredible albums ever. The album is breathtaking from start to finish. Blood Sugar Sex Magik is the pinnacle of the Red Hot Chili Peppers career, after this album they took a turn into a more commercial style. The majority of the songs are driven by the funky slap bass of Flea. RHCP stick to their earlier funk sound on tracks like If You Have To Ask, Give It Away, Mellowship Slinky In B Major, Naked In The Rain and Sir Psycho Sexy. This is the first album on which the Peppers' slow it down and mellow it out on tracks Breaking The Girl, I Could Have Lied, and the major hit Under The Bridge. John Frusciante's guitar stands out on his solo in If You Have To Ask, The Righteous and The Wicked, and Under The Bridge. Anthony Kiedis' lyrics are strong throughout addressing everything from love, war, drug addiction, and sexual experiences. Anthony shows he is capable of rapping and singing with equal conviction. The album's only downfall is the cover of Robert Johnson's They're Red Hot, but clocks in little over 1 minute. This track is not enough to break the incredible experience.
0425107469|1.0|I am not rating this book based off how Koontz produces his storyline, as he is a good writer in this regard. My 1 star rating is based off my preference of content: how it is presented.<br />A reviewer on this board stated that this is a book for everyone, regardless of age. This is NOT so!<br />Within this book you will find vulgarity in regards to sex and numerous disturbing murder scenes, one involving a boy and in another instance, the murderer daydreaming about his ultimate kill: a pregnant woman and her unborn child. To name a few. To mention also, there are numerous passages regarding animal mutilations.<br />This book is dark and quite disturbing and even though there was a good man, good woman (who in the beginning had quite an inferiority complex) and a friendly, smart dog (albeit laughable in regards to capabilities) presented in this book...they certainly couldn't make up for all the twisted, disturbing, dark and to put it plainly; downright evil mentality that Koontz so well displayed within \\"Watchers.\\"<br />This IS a graphic book.<br />If you don't mind this, then more than likely you will find it a well written book.<br />If you do mind this, you have been forewarned.
B000084T18|5.0|50 Cent is one of the hottest rappers out today. Every rhyme he spits is a hit. 50 was hot in the underground, but now he's hot in the public. He speaks what's on his mind, and is mindful about who is friends are. Can't nobody every knock him. He's been shot nine times, and stabbed. You know this man is a real thug. None of these rappers out here now got nothing on him.
B00005JL3A|5.0|if u like loud heavy rock music and this game then ull love this movie!
B00005JL78|3.0|When i saw the picture quality of the DVD of the movie itself, i thought that the DVD i bought was fake! but no it can't be because i bought it from an authorized dealer... But when i saw some of the comments about the quality too, i knew i bought the right one! good enough for me! hehe! But the story was really fantastic! especially the twist! Very unpredictable twist! Very nice! But i was still hoping they would release a better version of the picture quality ( a Superbit maybe) for this.
0446677450|3.0|I think that this book was all around informative. Most of the examples that the author used to support his concepts about money were common sense. However, certain people may not have been fully aware till they actually read this book. I agree with the point he efficiently made across: &quot;you shouldn't work for money&quot; but you should have &quot;money work for you.&quot;
B00005JL78|1.0|Alongside the likes of HARRY POTTER, MOULIN ROUGE, and SPIDER-MAN, the great Steven Spielberg succumbed to pressure and made one of the films that, arguably, is destined for the trash heap of film history.  MINORITY REPORT is just plain bad ... unimaginative in every aspect of its presentation.  Cruise's acting (or lack thereof) has never been more central to a film's failure as it is here.<br />At best, REPORT serves as what happens when two great minds get together ... and then forget that they have to have a credible story first.
B00000DGUG|5.0|To all those people who said &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; wasn't as hard-sounding as Alanis Morissette's previous release, and was the beginning of her musical downfall, I have one question for you: Are you ON something???  It's as fabulous as &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; or even better.  Hell, it surpasses it!!  It's a hell of a lot more introspective, and a lot more emotional.  Clearly, this album reflects the growing maturity that resulted from Alanis' trip to India.  A record that'll be talked about for years to come.
B00005JKCH|1.0|An incredibly boring, unimaginative, and viscerally unexciting adaptation of one of the world's most intriguing superheroes.  Sadly, this film falls flat, weighted down by superficial writing, canned ham acting, and the lack of a premise.<br />Largely a CGI-fest, Spider-man -- alongside films like MOULIN ROUGE and HARRY POTTER -- is a film that should never have been greenlighted ... much less greengoblinned.
B000002UD7|5.0|I wanted to review some albums for the first time here and decided to review my top 3 favorite albums of all time. The other 2 besides this would be Depeche Mode's Violator and Electronic's First Self Titled album. An interesteing fact about those other two albums is that 1) Neil Tennant of PSB said that DM's \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" is \\"the best pop song ever written\\" and 2) Neil Tennant did vocals on 2 tracks on the Electronic album. Well getting back to this album...every single track in this album is excellent with no exceptions. I remember listening to it for the first time on tape and every song kept getting better and better by the end of the album. I am still amazed to this date that how good these guys are to produce an album like that with so many good tracks.  \\"It's a Sin\\" is my favorite track on the album, a very melodic synthetic and stringish track. \\"Rent\\" is my 2nd favorite, which is a melower track on the album, but very melodic musically and vocally. \\"Heart\\" is probably my 3rd favorite, which was originally written for Madonna, but turned down by her (BIG MISTAKE! I am sure Madonna regrets it now). It ended up at #1 in the charts of UK and most of Europe, but was not released as a single in US. This album yielded several Top 10's in Europe and US. From memory I believe that \\"What have I done to deserve this\\" landed in number 2 in US and UK. An intersting fact is that the song \\"Always on Mind\\", an Elvis remake, came out as a single right after a couple of tracks had been released from \\"Actually.\\" The track landed in the Top 10 charts of US and European countries but was not available on any album. For a limited time, this single was inlcuded as a bundle in the US with the Actually album. Other great tracks on the album inlcude \\"King's Cross\\" and \\"Shopping.\\" This album is simply the best synth pop and dance album of the 80's, musically, vocally and production vise.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|... and that includes Meatballs II.<br />Baz when around shooting off his mouth prior to the Oscars, and he ruined his own opportunity to garner so much as a nomination for his direction: in his words, he had created the best film since CITIZEN KANE, and, with such disrespect for classic cinema, the Academy disagreed resolutely.  His arrogance killed his opportunity to be viewed as a visionary, and this film, especially, should be dismissed as a stock production best left to very lewd community theatres in lesser California communities.<br />The only redeeming quality the film offers: Ewan McGregor can sing, and he sings with a passion.  Had the film centered on his character instead of the stock players, MOULIN ROUGE might've worked.  Since Baz couldn't contain his arrogance, he's done little more than provided 'the alternative lifestyle community' with a regular rental and a film that the rest of society will rightfully ignore.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This is quite simply the best Teenie Bopper movie of the 90s.  It captures the soul, excitement, angst of being a teen without taking itself too serious or insulting your intelligence.  What's more, it actually has a plot.  Rent this, Jossie and the Pussycats, and Drive Me Crazy for a great night of teenage nonsense and fun!
B00008977N|4.0|I must say I'm a bit disappointed with this DVD.  This was touted as being specially reformatted for widescreen TVs and digitally remixed and remastered for DD 5.1 and DTS.  What upset me the most was the quality of the film transfer.  It looks very grainy as compared to what I saw on the laserdisc release (and compared to other concert DVDs that I have).  I think all they did to make the widescreen transfer was simply zoom in on the original 4:3 format (and ultimately cut off some of the top and bottom areas) so that it conformed to the 16:9 ratio.  It's probably not so bad on a regular TV - one of the downfalls with watching it on a HD (I have a 57&quot; Hitachi HD widescreen RPTV) or plasma displays is those types of displays simply magnify whatever is being fed to it - garbage in, garbage out.<br />Don't get me wrong - there's no question that this DVD should be part of any Peter Gabriel fan's DVD collection, but if you already have it on laserdisc, I would think twice before purchasing it.  Peter Gabriel is a master at what he does - despite the disappointing video quality, I still thoroughly enjoyed this concert.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is simply the most talented, awesome band I've heard in a very long time; maybe my entire life.  That's just how much I am obsessed with this CD.  I say obsessed because the feelings that their music evokes are beyond liking or loving a song.  It's dark, edgy, almost a little psychotic at times but always has this beauty and light beneath.  The lyrics themselves are deep and poetic.  They have so much more feeling than anything I've heard.  Amy's voice is like an angel; lovely and sad all at the same time.  Then the angst of the guitars and drums adds to every emotion.  I especially like the piano and orchestra in the background of many of the songs.  This CD is A MUST BUY for anyone looking for real talent amungst the music of today.  The first time i heard \\"Going Under\\" i was literally breathless.  Please do yourself a favor and buy this CD, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
B000083C49|5.0|On the behind the scenes disc of this two DVD set, writer-producer Harve Bennett says that people have told him often that they never liked or never watched Star Trek, but that they sure liked that Star Trek movie that had the whales in it.  This movie was so well written, directed and acted that, in my opinion, this will forever be the best Star Trek movie ever made.<br />The premise of this movie is quite similar to the third Planet of the Apes movie, only it is done so much better.  Seeing this movie on DVD made me think about how so many things that are in every Star Trek movie or TV episode AREN'T in this movie.  There is no Enterprise, hardly anyone in the movie is wearing a Starfleet Uniform, and none of the crew knows if they'll be able to continue to have the job security they once knew, or a home to go back to that will still exist.  Ditching the creature comforts of home works so well in this movie.  The humor is great, the crew learn new expletives and finger gestures, and they of course get what they came for.<br />The director's commentary on the DVD has Leonard Nimoy being way too hard on himself.  For example, he says that he wishes that they could have done more with the scene with the Klingon ship they are traveling in when it goes back in time to the modern age to get the whales.  I loved this scene -- what was wrong with it?  The whole scene was great, the out of body perspective from Kirk's point of view, hearing faint bits of dialogue that come later in the movie, and an awakening into consciousness that they aren't where they once were. Great!<br />The Behind the scenes DVD has plenty, and some that I think was meant for those who want to buy the entire series of Star Trek movies when they all come out on DVD with director's commentary, and behind the scenes documentaries as well.<br />I have fond memories of this film.  I remember that at the time this film came out in movie theaters, it was announced that there would be another Star Trek TVshow, but without the original cast.  I was disappointed.   After seeing Star Trek IV, I thought no one could top the adventures of the original crew.  I was wrong.
B000084T18|4.0|This album took me by surprise who knew that Eminem would sign him,I had heard of him before and he has a good voice good rapping style his hooks are a little too long sometimes but overall great c.d. Anyone who says that this album is garbage has definetely not listened to the album.A must buy the song &quot;Back Down&quot; where he disses Irv and Ja is off the hook,standout tracks also include &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot; featuring Eminem ,and &quot;Many Men&quot; .I look forward to hearing more from 50 CENT.
B000065U1N|5.0|I saw Black Hawk Down last January in theaters, and can safely say it was the most memorable movie experience I have ever had. When you see a movie like this, you don't just watch some technicolor bodies playing with CGI bullets, or muttering little \\"Be All You Can Be\\" catchphrases. You are sucked into the vacuum of that Hell, transported into a world that is not so far enveloped in the comfortable relapses of memory in the very long ago. It happened ten years ago, almost exactly, and portrays war as it should be portrayed. There is no blame on the Germans, no sharp villanous Japanese, no Confederates to blame, or Vietcong. You can't even really blame the Somalis, who are so completely and utterly destitute and de-humanized through and by their struggles. Our soldiers were sent in to help, not attack, not fight, but to feed the starving children sinking into the sands of the Somali Coast. <BR>Technicaly, the movie was filmed in a very efficient sepia tone, which gives it extra 'true grit.' The entire cast gives award-winning performances, including Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, and Orlando Bloom, who turn on their laurels of teen scene/indie scene/new scene to perform heart-felt-ly and o--tour de force. Hartnett proves his true acting capabilities (thank God after Pearl Harbor). Tom Sizemore, Sam Shepard, Jason Issacs, William Fichtner, Eric Bana, Ewen Bremner, Tom Hardy, Charlie Hofheimer, Tom Guiry,Ron Eldard, Steven Ford, Gregory Sporleder, Brian Van Holt, Hugh Dancy, Zeljko Ivanek,Matthew Marsden, Johnny Strong (II), Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Kim Coates, Glenn Morshower, Enrique Murciano, Jeremy Piven, Gabriel Casseus, Danny Hoch, Tac Fitzgerald, Richard Tyson, Michael Roof, Kent Linville, Ian Virgo, Carmine Giovinazzo, Chris Beetem, Ty Burrell, George Harris (II), Razaaq Adoti, Treva Etienne, Ioan Gruffudd, Jason Hildebrandt, Brendan Sexton III, Boyd Kestner, Abdibashir Mohamed Hersi, Pavel Voukan, Dan Woods (V), Kofi Amankwah, Joshua Quarcoo, Johann Myers, Lee Geohagen, Gianina Facio, Corey Johnson (I) are all incredible, giving performances of their careers. The cast is intensely and noticeably only male (besides Somali civilians); a very effective move, without any stupid lovey dovey moments between Red Cross nurses and fighter pilots in plane hangers. <BR>The story is mind-blowing, a D-Day microcosm that is beautifully written and enacted, and almost unbearable to watch. <BR>The movie has no baloney schticks about heroism and puts a youthful, recent human face (this is no Gary Cooper we have to call to mind) on our boys in a frightening, eye-opening film. In upcoming events, this is going to be the type of war we fight, in the streets, in blown-out buildings, and in the middle of civilians who keep guns under their children's pillows. <BR>One of the best movies ever made, 1900 and onward, and a war movie the caliber of Platoon, a reccomendation that must be adhered to. I do not ask you to see this movie. I am telling you to, for the sake of those boys who were dragged through the streets, bloody and broken, and who are slowly forgotten in the sands of memory.
B00005YTFG|5.0|This is an awesome movie with an incredible cast that has an extraordinary talent. Ewan Mcgregor has the most wonderful voice i have ever heard and Nicole Kidman has a great voice. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals or love stories!
0316666343|1.0|In one word, BORING. The beginning is &quot;gripping&quot; but the novel reads on like an after school special.
B0000541AM|5.0|This film is an insane hybrid of \\"Clockwork Orange\\", \\"West Side Story\\", and Greek mythology!  More than typical action fare, \\"The Warriors\\" is really a dystopic thinly disguised as an update to a classical tale, Xenophon's \\"Anabasis.\\"  To the more casual viewer, it's one of the most underrated action films of the late 1970s.<br />Set in a bleak, alternate New York circa 1978, \\"The Warriors\\" almost instantly immerses its audience in a bizarre reality.  It is, of course, a gang film. The plot is simple; a gang separated from its leader treks through dangerous territory to return to their home turf.  Complicating matters, they are falsely accused of murder and are pursued by every rival gang in the city.  There do not appear to be any adults or \\"civilians\\", or any other non-gang faction.  There are police, but they are just another gang themselves.<br />What is really unusual is the depth of this alternate world, and how quickly it engages the viewer.  Three minutes into the film, the viewer is led to believe that a 1970s New York gang would willingly dress up as purple pimps!  Another gang is made up as mimes, AND look menacing at the same time. The most over-the-top gangs are the multiracial skinheads (!) and the clown-faced baseball-bat wielding Baseball Furies.  The language is almost completely invented for this film and by the end is second-nature to the viewer.  There are many references to the classics - from the \\"chorus\\" (a faceless DJ calling the action) to the aforementioned \\"furies\\".  It sounds bizarre...but it works, and it's very engaging.<br />Unfortunately, \\"The Warriors\\" did not achieve widespread recognition due to an inexplicable campaign to suppress it during its theatrical run.  Rumors about alleged gang violence at theaters led to a quick demise, only to be resurrected as a cult film at midnight showings and on cable during the early 1980s.  Anyone who thinks \\"The Warriors\\" resembles modern youth culture has clearly been asleep for the last 20 years.  One only needs to witness the jaw-dropping Purple Pimps and the Menacing Mimes to realize this.<br />It's violent, but relatively bloodless.  The most lethal weapons are fists, bats, and chains.  It's one of the most creative films, and Walter Hill's vision was risky.  It works, and it even holds up well after 24 years.<br />Watch for the extensive use of NYC subways (though not always geographically accurate), and the 1978 anachorisms - in the background a sharp-eyed viewer can see posters for \\"Foul Play\\", \\"Heaven Can Wait\\", and \\"Grease\\".<br />Great DVD and a fascinating film, hightly recommended.ears.

0446343129|2.0|This book is an over-the-top rant about the evils of sugar.  According to the author, most major evils were caused by sugar: the Bubonic Plague, The Crusades, Slavery, Witchunts and every physical and mental problem experienced by the human race.  He also slams the medical profession,the Catholic Church, European and US governments and the ruling and industrial elite.  While I agree that too much sugar is harmful and unhealthy, Dufty's extreme views detract from his message.  He sounds like a conspiracy theorist.  His conclusions are not supported by scientific or historical facts but are rather conjecture and personal opinion. Dufty tries to imply support by using footnotes, but the referenced material is inadequate.  His logic is also seriously flawed.  For example, he claims that because the Plague struck city dwellers (who consumed more sugar) instead of country dwellers (who consumed less sugar), one's consumption of sugar made one more susceptible to the Plague.  He completely ignores the fact that the Plague was caused by fleas on rats who flourished in the crowded, unsanitary cities.  It is hard to wade through the hyperbole in this book.  It seems like Dufty is a very angry person with an axe to grind.  This makes it hard to take his book seriously.
0064409422|5.0|This is perhaps C.S. Lewis' most famous work.  And rightly so, it is a memorable and orignal tale.  Christian metaphors are generously applied in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, however they are sufficiently subtle and general enough so as not to offend readers of any background or creed.  The story stresses themes of forgiveness, sacrifice and the struggle for freedom against evil.  All this set in a fantasy world full of talking beasts and mythological creatures.  The heros are 4 british children.  If you've run out of Harry Potter books this is more than a substitute.  Regardless you won't be dissapointed.  For fans of Christian literature this is also a great book for you library.  Lewis is very subtle but very powerful Christian writer.  Great for kids and adults alike I give it my highest recomendation.

B000063US7|4.0|I should rate this 5 stars but it what cause me great pain. I have been a genesis fan way back when the were a band few new but those that did knew how special they really were. If anyone could ever find me a \\"Seconds Out\\" DVD I would appreciate it but I do not think it was ever produced. That to me is Genesis and what they stand for. If you really want to do yourself a favor get the disc and sit and enjoy. Back to this DVD. Well produced an its hard not to like collins and great musicians. Bottom line is for those that love Genesis it is one to add to your collection. The old medly is what I enjoyed the most and it does not give it justice as those songs on \\"Seconds Out\\" You won't be dissapointed...
B000063DFN|4.0|Powerslave Spotlights Maiden at their technical, creative, and commercial Peak. To me it is definetly one of three Maiden Metal Masterpieces along with The Debut Album and Piece of Mind. Only a handfull of bands can claim 3 or more masterpeices in any genre. Maidens techincal expertise, playing, writing, and Bruce Dickinsons powerfull vocals are evident on every note of the album. The Produciton, even  years later, is crisp, clear, and modern with the instruments all equally spotlighted and clear without being as overproduced as there next few records. Here is a song by song breakdown:<br />Aces high - A masterpiece. One of greatest Metal songs ever.<br />2 Minutes to Midnight - Another Classic which continues to be played on tour through 2002.<br />Losfer Words - An odd placed instrumental. While the groove and the playing are tight it seems odd to follow up 2 hard hitting tracks with what amounts to a repitive jam session. This sounds like filler and with only 8 songs on the disk could have been left off for a B side if the band had another tune ready to go.<br />Flash of The Blade - A decent, but unmemorable track about some midevil swordsman who fights to avenge his family<br />The Duellists - essentailly part 2 of the above track, but with a much stronger melodic chorus and awesome Bass, mellow guitar, heavy Guitar Solo section in the middle.<br />Back In The Village - I love this track. Great Riff. Great Melody. Sounds like its about a war Vet who can't get over the War. Powerfull underrated track.<br />Powerslave - A standout song with an Awesome Riff, Great Vocal/Melody, and a cool slow midddle section that provides the dynamics missing on some of the albums earlier tracks.<br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner - Maiden nailed their &quot;Stairway&quot; on this track. They have several other attempts at &quot;Epic&quot; tracks on several other albums but none come close to this.<br />So how can a Materpiece only garner 4 stars. The instrumental and follow up Flash of the Blade Track sound fairly repititive and break up the momentum of the record. The disk recovers nicely and finishes strong, but in a single listen I can sometimes lose my &quot;Music Buzz&quot; and want to skip these tracks or even hit the stop button when this happens. Also, the album lacks as much dynamics on whole as some other records. Howevre, with that exception noted this is undoubtedly a top 10 Metal Masterpiece and a Must own for any Maiden or Metal Head. If your a casual Metal listener (How many of those are there?) this is a standout record for your collection.
0783229372|5.0|I haven't seen the widescreen version of this film yet, but I still love the movie.  I had heard of this film, but didn't think anything of it until I saw the end of it on cable one morning.  I remember that I was always fond of those old zeppelins, so I decided to rent the movie.  Amazing special effects by veteran special effects maker Albert Whitlock that won on of the films two Oscars, beautiful Oscar nominated photography by veteran cinematographer Robert L. Surtees, a beautiful and memorable score by David Shire, and brilliant directing by Citizen Kane editor, Oscar winning director Robert Wise.  I hope to have this DVD version of this wonderful film, so that I can see its real splendor.
6305622914|5.0|A fresh comedy that had become a classic for people all ages. Spectacular acting and message.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I think that the Norah Jones album debute was an exceptional work by a young and becoming artist. I bought the album before I had known anything about Norah, her family ties or grammy nominations. And was very impressed with the tracks on the CD and instantly became a huge fan. I was shocked to hear that Norah was nominated for so many Grammy's and believed that they would overlook someone so sort of low key Adult Contemporary. I was actually stunned but excited that the Album was rewarded with so many Grammy's this year. I give it an A.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I have to say that the movie had a good story and I was never bored watching it. My only complait is that the movie was fast going and that the story was clearly rushed. I was really dissapointed when they deleted 7 scenes from the movie.      (found published in the website) They did make good war scenes though!
B00005AWMF|5.0|If you like the music of Helen Fossade Adu (Sade to you), this compilation, along with her first album &quot;Diamond Life&quot; (which has some really good tunes not included here) are all you'll need. This has all the good stuff like &quot;Kiss Of Lfe,&quot; Never As Good As The First Time,&quot; &quot;Nothing Can Come Between Us,&quot; etc. So it is an unquestionably worthwhile purchase of one of the classiest and classiest sounding true divas of our time.

B00005QDW5|5.0|Several of my favorite Floyd songs where left off this album (Welcome to the machine, Young Lust, Run like hell, Have a Cigar, On the turning away, Not now John...) But the majority is...Probably should be an Anthology instead of best of. Echoes is a great CD for the non-die hard fan. I own the \\"popular albums\\" like Dark Side, The Wall, Wish you were here and this CD enhances my collection nicely.
B00005JM93|5.0|there's lots of laughs and this is a good film for the whole family.it makes people fall in love all over again and re marry each other in the aisles and it brings you joy to know that people are putting great family films out like this everyday now cause in the past they didn't do nothin but support filth and violent dirt trash.this film is finally something you can watch with the wife and not be afraid to pass gas afterwards because she loves you and  the film loves children and wants us all to be the best in our lives until we die from everything we eat.but gaspar noe blew my children away with this little gem.he made them want to live again and since i saw it i've become a filmmaker who makes family movies.
B000000WCA|5.0|Ahh...the Spice Girls where would the US be without them??  LOL...even if you are a fan or not, you have to admit that the Spice Girls dominated the Pop & Culture scene in 1997 & 1998.<br />...  Some critics could even call this the \\"second British invasion\\" because of the Spice Girls' huge influence over music for the years to come.<br />The Spice album definitely shows the manufactured traces by the lack of lyrical depth in some songs, but the upbeat/happy melodies and tunes far outweight the commerical production of the album.  This album definitely has \\"girl power\\" written all over it!  Overall, I would highly suggest to avid Pop fans to buy this album not only because of the great beats but because it's probably the defining album of the Teen Pop phenomena.  If you are not into pop music, I would steer clear of this album because Pop music is immersed all over this album.
B00004YRQA|4.0|You won't get as much fun out of your PS2 without getting at least one, if not two memory cards.  Of course, their role is nothing more than allowing you to save your games/ seasons if playing sports, and that's why it's needed.<br />The real drawback is a lack of utility program to delete what you no longer want to play, adn it eats up your space.  It also annoys customers when they find they really need one, and yet there wasn't even one supplied in the PS2 console.<br />But if you want to enjoy your experience on the PS2, then you have to get one, and again, I recommend two.
B000084T18|4.0|Welcome to the words of 50 Cent. With the release of this blockbuster album, 50 Cent manages to touch on every subject a rapper with his background should. Being shot nine times and stabbed, he doesn't rap about the wrongdoings of society or government controversy, but he raps about the streets. He raps about the respect he wants from other rappers and the money he plans on getting while doing so. He ranges from hard hitting gansgta rap (Back Down, Heat) to rapping about coming on up (Poor Lil' Rich, Patiently Waiting).<br />The album starts off with \\"What Up Gangsta\\" introducing himself with a great beat and above average lyrics. He has room to grow as a rapper, but then again all rappers do. He shouldn't be mentioned with the best (Tupac, Big, or Rakim), but comparisons with Tupac is hard to avoid. Tupac came out as the gangster who rapped about hope/money and so has 50 Cent. \\"Patiently Waiting\\" is easily the best track on the album, bringing up 9/11 references and criticizing the music industry. It features Eminem and he takes away the spotlight beautifully with one of the best verses ever rapped. <br />\\"Many Men\\", the second best on the song, is about the ones who wish bad luck on 50. The song shows hints of him trying to make his way off the streets and living the American Dream. The first single, \\"In Da Club\\", is a classic party track, lyrically impaired but great ear candy and catchy. After this track, the album goes from great to good, but only temporarily. High All The Time, Heat, and If I Can't are unskippable tracks (just like the rest of the album), but the album would have been perfect without them. <br />You would think a song wouldn't be great if each lyric ended with \\"mayn\\", but Blood Hound pulls it off. It has tough lyrics and with the street cred of 50, you wouldn't question the realism brought with his words. Each CD now seems to come with a \\"diss\\" towards someone and Back Down is 50 Cent's diss towards the label known as Murder Inc. A very humorous skit at the end parodies groupies and their love for their idols, in this case being Ja Rule. The track has a dark beat and it puts down Ja Rule and Cadillac Tah among others. The only way this \\"diss\\" track would have been better was if it was releaased last year when Ja was all over the radio.<br />P.I.M.P. and Like My Style are tracks that express his pride about his luck with women and money. To women these tracks would probably give off an obnoxious appearance, but without that in mind they're great to listen to. Poor Lil Rich is a great song about his own rags to riches tell and his anticipation for more riches. Similar to Patiently Waiting but with more attitude. 21 Questions shows the romantic side of 50 Cent and at the same time is not to soft. This track should be very appealing to women and if he's smart he would release this as a single, but might not because he doesn't want to be compared to Ja Rule...Don't Push Me is the second track produced by Eminem (first being Patiently Waiting). It's a tough track and is the coming out party of Eminem as a gangsta and seems to hint at a new style for Eminem. Gotta Make It To Heaven is a great concluding track to a great album with a beat consisting of conga drums and guitars. If 50 keeps producing this kind of material he should be remembered. The only cons of the album are that the lyrics could be better and the three tracks mentioned above. Dr. Dre is a major part of the success of this album. The original beats and how the album was put together is an example to other producers who want to be known. This album is essential to any rap colection, and so should his futures ones if he keeps this up.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This review will be short becouse there is nothing to say about this movie that has not been said already. Cane is the greatest movie ever. In my listmainia I put it behind Gone With The Wind when it really is 1A. Orsen Wells took directing to a different level and his style is still being used today.<BR>      The story if about Charles Foster Cane (Wells) a newspaper tycoon. I will not say more becouse you should see it for yourself. Do yourself a favor and get the DVD with the commintary by Roger Ebert. It gives real insight to this already amazing film....
B000089RVX|3.0|When I first heard the song \\"Bring me to life\\" on the radio I was amazed by the lead singer Amy Lee's voice.All though this music is not metal to me it's more on the light rock side and sound's more like new age music.The song \\"Bring me to life\\" <BR>is one of the only song's on here that has a heavy background <BR>at some point's in the song.But overall her voice is <BR>phoenominal and it will leave you breathless.Especially<BR>when you hear \\"Bring me to life\\".I'm not crazy about the <BR>rest of the album but I only love that song.I don't <BR>like it just because it's not heavy or metal.I listen<BR>to alot of different music but this band just doesn't<BR>cut it for me.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Steal this Album does not have one song that would even be faintly noticeable as a 'B-side.' Now, although I thought their Sophomore release, 'Toxicity' was pretty good with some more than excellent songs on it and some really great vocals by one of Metal's greatest singer Serj Tankian, it was only the second half of that CD that was truly satisfying.  I hated Prison Song, which is probably one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my life, and I also hated the next four songs that appeared there, which sounded more like a B-side or a should-have-been-rejected song.  With Steal this Album, however, I can sit down and listen to the whole thing.  Even the ridiculously nonsensical Chich'N'Stu sounds very good, billions upon billions of times better than the horrible 'Prison Song' off Toxicity.  I am so shocked that the band didn't replace those first five songs with great songs like 'Streamline' or 'Mr. Jack.'  System take on a more hard-core and seriously dark feel to it, addressing political issues, (As they always do, of course) and, all in all, just presenting good music.  The only song that I was dissapointed in was 36, which was just way too short, about fifty seconds, if not shorter.  Steal This Album goes back to the roots of S.O.A.D, and true fans that appreciate the L.A. four will be delighted with listening to it.  the lyrics are great, of course, the drums are once again amazingly wild and magnificently done, the bass is just as entertaining as ever, and the screaming/melodic/haunting/sorrowful voice of Serj Tankian screaming his poetic words into the microphone is just as talented as the past two.  I love this CD, as I do all the System CD's, and I savour it everytime I pop it into my CD player.
B00006AW2G|5.0|I admit I have not heard &quot;Beggar's Banquet,&quot; &quot;Sticky Fingers,&quot; or &quot;Exile On Main Street,&quot; but &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; is the best Stones album I have yet set my ears on.<BR>  1969 saw the release of two of the decade's greatest albums, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; and &quot;Let It Bleed.&quot;  I won't compare the albums, but I can certainly say that each one is brilliant in its own right.  Below are brief critiques of each song on &quot;Let It Bleed.&quot;<br />1. Gimme Shelter: Unarguably a classic song by the Stones and anyone, &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; has great lyrics and guitar work.  <BR>2. Love In Vain: A good blues song, especially because of the mandolin solo.<BR>3. Country Honk: The rock version (&quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;) that appeared as the B-side of &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot; may be better, but this is still a great song.  The fiddle and guitars show that a band only slightly inferior to the Beatles can at least play better country (the Beatles' &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; is sheer mock-country).<BR>4. Live With Me: Keith always has the best bass lines, while Bill Wyman is hardly more than Mick and Keith's &quot;sweetest pet in the world&quot; to put it Stone-esquely.  The guitars are great as well.<BR>5. Let It Bleed: A good title track, but not the best song on the album, &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; is good country-honky-tonk-rock without a mocking tone to it.<BR>6. Midnight Rambler: I love this song for everything - its unconventional length, virtuoso harmonica and guitars, and threatening lyrics.<BR>7. You Got the Silver: One of the album's lighter songs, &quot;You Got the Silver&quot; is an example of what Keith Richards sounded like before the dreadful &quot;Losing My Touch&quot; from &quot;Forty Licks.&quot;<BR>8. Monkey Man: Lyrics aside, &quot;Monkey Man&quot; has the best guitar lick on the entire album.  My personal favorite.<BR>9. You Can't Always Get What You Want: You can't appreciate the Stoneswithout having an ear for this classic, a great closing track.<BR>  <BR>  Buy &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;, please, and don't you dare buy any album released after &quot;Tattoo You&quot; along with it.
0140186425|5.0|Of Mice and Men is a great prototype for gritty realism.  At the end there are no sunsets or glorious lifting of burdens that leave the protagonists free from worry for all time.  However, it isn't an exercise in sorrow either.  It is a portrait of a life and of two men trying to make one together.  Yet, the one with the brains can only do so much, as the childlike giant is a danger to everyone around him, without meaning to be.  This is one of Steinbeck's classics and for good reason.  It is short yet it says everything it needs to say, which I think is one of the marks of a great writer: stop writing when the story is finished.  This novel is deservedly a classic.
B000021YQV|5.0|WHOOHOO! Awesome cd!Awesome band too!Buy this cd today!I love this cd!
0689835604|5.0|Every once in a while, I come across a book that appeals to the adult in me, because it's educational, artistic, amusing or perhaps all of the above, but what fascinates me is when my son discovers the real value in a work, and teaches me a thing or two along the way. To adults \\"Where is the Baby's Belly Button\\" written and illustrated by Karen Katz appears to be a simple 14-page book that teaches body parts, but to children it's much more. <br />This nifty little board book is essentially a peek-a-boo book with flaps. It measures approximately 8 ¼\\" x 7 ½\\" x ½ \\", and is constructed of cardboard with heavy card stock for the flaps. The images are simply illustrated, yet brightly colored with creatively contrasted backgrounds that produce interest. The text appears on the left side of the book with bold, solid colored backdrops that emphasis the large black printing, and compliment the illustrations on the opposing page. The writing consists of short, four or five word sentences, such as, \\"Where are baby's eyes?\\" The reader lifts the flap and it says, \\"Under the hat.\\" The picture shows a baby hiding under a hat, and when the flap is lifted the baby's face is revealed. She is pointing to her eyes. <br />\\"Where is the Baby's Belly Button\\" has been one of my son's most requested books for a year now; he's nearly two-years old. He lovingly refers to this book as the \\"baby\\" book, and he has taught me that he has learned where his eyes, mouth, belly button, feet, and hands are, in addition to understanding the meaning of the words, hat, cup, shirt, cat, bubbles and WHERE. The question, \\"Where?\\" comes out of his mouth probably 20 or 30 times everyday, and I am certain it's because of this book. I wish the flaps were made of a heavier card stock as they have become creased over time, which is expected with use, but also preventable with a heavier stock. This book has been a huge hit, and one I haven't gotten tired of reading over and over again. I recommend this book for one-year olds and up as the interactive feature, (lifting of the flaps) is too advanced for younger babies, however an infant would probably find the images fascinating all the same.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I am not generally into jazz, so I wouldn't know how Norah Jones compares to the greats of the past etc. etc.  All I can say is that I consider myself a fan of music, and an open minded individual, and I listened to this CD from start to conclusion, and received tremendous pleasure.  It was fantastic. It was definitely goosebump-worthy music. I absolutely loved it...
B000000H5K|2.0|Ok..this is not at all Thrash Metal , Sepultura totally sold out , this is just plain,horrible,...,simple , boring ,repetitive..Nu Metal(if you have any more words to describe it just let me know).I mean , this may be a good album , but not up to the standards of the Sepultura . All the songs are almost the same , the voice totally changed and you can bearly tell what the guitars are playing . So my advice , if you like Thrash metal dont buy this... , this is NU METAL,this is for guys who like korn,limp bizkit and all that Popish music for 15 year old kids . God am i angry man.<BR>See ya
B000002HRE|1.0|Mindboggling it is to know that Metallica continues to sell millions of cds despite not having put out even a remotely fair album in over 12 years. How this cd sold over 10 million records with this alterna/country-metal is a sin...Bands like Saxon, Manowar, Deep Purple, even the L.A. Guns (yes, I did say the L.A. Guns - see 'American Hardcore') released MUCH better 'metal' albums the same year and maybe sold some 60,000 copies combined. <br />Truth be told -- the name METALLICA sells and still receives overexposure. Undoubedlty thee most OVERRATED band in all of metal history, nothing after Metallica's S/T album is worth purchasing. Many people have brainwashed themselves into thinking the past few Metallica albums are actually worthwhile.... This album [stinks] plain and simple. Once one of the soldiering bands for the faith of true heavy rock, now you hear Metallica on alternative radio stations sandwhiched between Foo Fighters and Blink 182 (or other Top 40 teeny bopper music) and going on tours with rap-rock bands like Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park (they had even asked Eminem to tour but he declined, are you kidding me?). Truely Shameful. If you wana hear some GOOD Metallica, pick up Ride THe Lightning and avoid this abomination.  If you want to sink your teeth into some recent solid metal, I'd simply say avoid Metallica entirely and do some homework.
B0000542DJ|5.0|A riveting drama of Jim Garrison & his pursuit for the truth in the Kennedy assassination. Kevin Costner plays the role superbly, with Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw. Sissy Spacek plays Mrs. Garrison who feels her husband is spending too much time on the case and not enough time with his family. This movie will make you stop and think...was it a conspiracy?
B00006690G|5.0|once u listen to this cd u wont b able to stop eminem is one of the best rappers out there and the song my dads gone crazy is just the cutest because his daughter hailie is in it and once u listen to track 14 u will see hear a totally diff side of eminem u will hear his sweet loving side for his daughter hailie those of u who dont like him will have a totally diff perscpetive of him because of this track.
6305878323|5.0|Absoloutly innocent and adorable fun that the whole family will love. With the cartoons, jokes and classic songs, this is a film that kids to great grandparents can watch and enjoy equally.<br />There is so many great and important lessons too in the film. One such lesson is in the song \\"feed the birds\\" which teaches the importance of caring for all living things. Personally I get a warm and \\"in touch with Earth\\" feeling when I feed a deer, duck, etc, etc... Another great lesson comes from Burts job as a chimney sweep. As he and the children look out through the rooftop view of the city, burt tells the children how only the birds, planes and chimney sweeps get to see this view everyday. Its an important lesson to see the bright side of things even in the worst of situations. That is only a few of the great messages this movie delivers.<br />Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews are amazing in Mary Poppins and show great chemistry. You can really tell how much love they put into this masterpiece.<br />  The DVD quality is amazing. Im a bit dissapointed that there is no extra cartoons with this one, but the movie is more then enough fun.
B000003FMY|4.0|The best orchestra of all time.  Period.  No Exceptions.  The epitome of good taste, boldness, clean playing, and everything else good.  Also a conductor with mostly perfect interpretation.  well, perfet but with one exception.<br />This exception is Night on Bald Mountain, which he simply takes about 2x too fast.  The orchestra still nails it, but all flavor and savor is gone form the piece (the slow half is still good, however).  this is why i took away the fifth star from my rating.<br />Also, the low brass section in their featured mvmt. of &quot;Pictures&quot; (Catacombs, i think) is a little quiet, and tends to put me to sleep.  However, their playing is fantastic; perfect intonation, articulation, and &quot;togetherness&quot;.  I just wish they were at, say, forte instead of mezzo-piano.<br />Marche Slav is perfect.  Say No More!<br />Hearing this recording of &quot;Pictures&quot; made it impossible to imagine any other as even moderately acceptable.  in fact, listening to another, as i am now (just got it from the library...definitely not worth it, so i won't mention the orch./cond.) proves that no other recording can even touch on the glory of this remarkable work.
B000069AUI|4.0|An excellent, well \\"put\\" together arrangement of strings and vocals.  This album has it all, melody, uplift and vocals that are sure to play in your head long after you turn off music.  Full appreciation and support for the music they have brought to this world, in this ever \\"drifting\\" apart world.<br />This is one of those albums that you can sit back, relax and unwind and listen to the entire album with a feeling of enlightenment and a \\"thirst\\" for taking on the following day in a more positive attitude.<br />Tracks like \\"Clocks\\" really are classic tunes, which will test the stand of time no doubt<br />Fantastic, let's hope they can continue this excellence in the years to follow.<br />Iceblue<BR>
6300214559|4.0|Helena Bonham Carter stars as the young girl who for nine days was Queen of England.  Lady Jane Grey was Henry VIII's niece and a staunch Protestant.  Through political machinations, the dying King Edward (a teenager) makes his cousin Jane his successor, not the legitimate choice, his very Catholic sister Mary.  Jane is forced into an arranged marriage to facilitate the move and soon finds herself on a throne she never wanted.  Her husband gives her much support, and the two decide to make changes that will benefit the long suffering common man.  But Mary will not be denied her throne (and neither will her husband, the Spanish king).  Queen Jane is removed and condemned to death, quite a common fate back then.  The acting is tops, with Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes as her husband delivering excellent performances, surrounded by a cast of pros.  The sets, costumes, and other period details are terrific as well.  I wasn't expecting to see a romance film, which is what this movie develops into.  It's not very accurate, although the actors have a great chemistry and make it work.  I was expecting to see more of the political behind-the-scenes treachery, since the story of Lady Jane is rooted in religious conflict and personal ambition.  The politics of Tudor England are fascinating, and this film certainly deals with the political and religious climate, but I would like to have seen more.  Nonetheless, the film is well made and serves as a solid introduction to that critical time in English history.
B0000636UN|1.0|This album is a snore! This is a woman that is too stupid to realize that even after 9/11 that war was declared on the United States. She would rather the US be attacked again so she can write some sorry song about it instead of being proactive in protecting itself. A weak album from a misguided person!
6305127646|2.0|I just wrote a scathing review of the &quot;I Spy&quot; movie, grouping it with the worst of the television-to-big-screen productions.  Among those I included &quot;The Saint&quot; and realized that I hadn't warned the unwary about this movie.  Tom Keogh's review describes the problem with this movie perfectly.  It might be an OK espionage movie but it's a miserable treatment of Simon Templar, as anyone would know who is familiar with Leslie Charteris' knight errant.  Where Val Kilmer uses goofy disguises to accomplish his task, Simon Templar would brazenly face the villian with the dare to thwart his imminent undoing.  George Sanders and Roger Moore were superior as Simon Templar and enjoyed the benefit of superior writers if not Leslie Charteris, himself.  Sadly, who ever sold the rights to this property was only seeing the dollar signs.  Simon Templar should have paid them a visit.
B000063UR1|2.0|There is not a great deal I have that's positive to say about this movie.<br />First off, it's heavily derivative, especially of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey: Alone in deep space, things get very weird, equipment fails, innocent astronatus die, remaining crew go through a psychedelic space trip hurtling through the rings of Saturn and nothing else makes a lot of sense. Switching things around so it is the meatware that goes bonkers doesn't really alter this fact. But its \\"grand\\" scheme is where similarities end, and even there it's more of a contrast than a compare. In no sense is Silent Running in the same league as 2001.<br />Then the screenplay, such as it is, is dire - there's very little dialogue, hardly any action and the action you do get adds nothing to the narrative or dramatic tension (why the demise of the third robot? Why not just start with two? Why the game of cards?).<br />The plot scenario is ludicrous from the beginning: even allowing the silly premise that the Earth has become, by intended human intervention, totally devoid of plant life (which, the amateur biologist in me shrieks, would surely destroy the oxygen/carbon dioxide equilibrium, would it not?), then to receive an order, with no explanation, to nuke the remaining space-bound conservatories and return the boys to earth defies any sort of credulity. As does Lowell's ability to reprogramme robots to understand ecology and card games by looking in the manual, soldering their motherboards a bit, and typing in a programme.<br />For a supposedly pro-ecology film (if it were one of these, it was certainly ahead of its time) there are a number of anomalies, chief among them Trumbull's curious decision to portray the hero and saviour of the plants as a murderous paranoid weirdo. Mind you, with the strains of Joan Baez gagging her way through a staggeringly awful cycle of (specially commissioned!) folk songs, perhaps you can excuse the poor man of cutting up a little rough.<br />Last, Silent Running was - quite apparently - made on the cheap. The sets are drab - much of the space ship looks suspiciously like a partially converted warehouse, and the blue-screening and special effects are ho-hum.<br />Given that special fx was Trumbull's bag, the shortcoming on this score pretty much sums up the rest of the film.nning was - quite apparently - made on the cheap.

B00005QY5Y|3.0|I wanted to give that 3 stars and 1/2,but looks like it's impossible to do.I listened to that album hundreds of times,being completely obsessed with Ryan Adams and his music,and I plan to keep listening to it until the CD falls down to pieces and I have to buy another one.That said I can't rate it more than 3 and 1/2.It's full of flaws that prevent it from being the great album it could have been.On paper the lyrics are stunning,maybe some of the best he has ever written,and buried under overproduction the tunes sound catchy and interesting.I don't mind the fact that every track sounds like something else.I'm not a purist,and I can consider Gold as some kind of travel through American music and culture (which connects well with the cover of the album I guess...),this is not what bothers me.Aside from the annoying screechy badly high-pitched voice that Ryan uses on some of the songs,which is twice as irritating knowing how good his voice actually is,the main thing that makes Gold a good friend instead of a lovely soulmate is that there's too much in it.Layers and layers of stuff.Lots of instuments.<BR>Greatness is all about taking off and polishing,cutting edges.This record spills like ice cream.I like ice cream,but monuments are made of stone,ice cream doesn't last much.Heartbreaker was like a good painting in a beautiful frame,Gold is still a good painting,full of colours,but somehow doesn't fit the frame.
B00005JLEU|4.0|Spirited Away is yet another masterpiece from Japan's undisputed master of animation. Although I did not enjoy it as much as Princess Mononoke, I was more entertained by this film than by any Disney movie made in the past five years. Speaking of Disney, I thought I would clear up a few misconceptions that some people have concerning this film. Firstly, for those people who complain that Miyazaki's films (as well as other anime) are for adults, and not children, I should point out that Miyazaki has explicitly stated that Spirited was made for young girls. (in other words, Chihiro's age) This doesn't mean that the film can only be enjoyed by pre-pubescant girls (I myself am a 22 year old male); it just means that you should not go into this film expecting something geared towards adults, the way Mononoke was. <BR>Now I have noticed several people on this site comparing Spirited to Disney. Everyone seems to agree that it is nothing like Disney, because it is scary. Some parents even go so far to say that Spirited is inappropriate for children. Let me just say that you are all both right and wrong on this issue. Spirited Away is nothing like Disney as it is NOW. However, if you look at classics like Snow White, and especially Pinocchio, you'll see that these films have much more in common with Spirited Away than with, say, Hercules, or Tarzan. As far as I'm concerned, anyone who claims that Spirited is too scary for children ought to remember what Disney used to be like. In Snow White, the wicked Queen ordered the huntsman to cut out Snow White's heart. Even more telling, in Pinocchio, the main character ends up on an island for wicked children, who are mercilessly transformed into beasts and sold into slavery. Can you honestly say that this is somehow more wholesome or less nightmarish than what goes on in Spirited? Anyone who remembers these films recognizes that Spirited Away's often nightmarish sense of morality and justice (parents being turned into pigs for theirgreed) is not novel to the American imagination, but something old, something many of us have clearly forgotten, even though we saw these very films as children! This harkens back to a time when Americans had a much clearer sense of morality, a much greater willingness to recognize an absolute line between right and wrong. For me, this is refreshing, for you it may not be. As for your children being scared, I agree it is a possibility. I was scared when I saw Snow White and Pinocchio, yet I enjoyed those two films immensely. Moreover, they are both considered to be undisputed classics of American animation. So to all those parents who think they can comfortably dismiss Spirited Away as some alien abomination, you had better look closer to home, because it may not be quite as alien as you thought.
B000089RVX|5.0|Every so often, a band comes along that sparks imagination and tears through the radio charts.  People start talking, the buzz grows, and you buy the CD half-afraid it won't match your expectations.<br />Evanescence put my fears to rest.<br />The buzz for this band is incredible, and the talk is backed up by some fresh music.  Mixing power chords, orchestration, haunting choir arrangements, and evocative lyrics, Evanescence brews a heady concoction that sounds instantly attainable, yet just out of reach.  You listen through the track list once, twice, three times...and you still feel that you're only just beginning to lay hold of these songs.  From the heart-wrenching power of &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;Tourniquet,&quot; to the soulful &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello,&quot; to the ethereal feel of &quot;Haunted&quot; and &quot;Whisper,&quot; this album has few weak moments.<br />I've &quot;Fallen&quot; for the sound of this great band.  Not only do they throw themselves in our faces with their music and presence, they sneak up on us with word pictures and song arrangements that cause us to look at situations in a whole new light.<br />For all the darkness of this album, I play it through and feel as though a light has come on...&quot;though they're screaming your name, don't close your eyes; God knows what lies behind them, don't turn out the light&quot; (Whisper--track 11).<br />If, indeed, the band's name means &quot;fleeting...to fade away,&quot; then I can only hope they don't live up to their name.
B00003CXA2|5.0|How wonderful a place the world would  be if even 10% of men were like Forrest Gump - amazingly simple, astoundingly perfect and alarmingly good.<br />Love and committment have such universal chord that it brings in tears spontaneously when two people destined for each other, eventually get married too. I had not read the novel before watching the movie; it felt so good to see Jenny finally deciding to marry Forrest.. it seems almost a perfect reward for Forrest's life time contributions of being a good man.<br />The best part of the movie is that it does make one shed at least one undesirable trait of one's persona, rather uassumingly. The power of love and humanism, and the demands it makes on one's emotions, is indeed the only reason for every human being to be born and stay alive.<br />Tom Hanks is brilliant and uarguably the best actor around in our times. <br />PS : If the movie evokes nostalgia and longingness for your childhood sweetheart from neighbourhood of long past, as against marriages of urban convenience, remember to thank Jenny !
0140177396|5.0|An excellent piece of classic American literature, painting a very detailed picture of early America and the foot and thumb tradition.<br />Steinbeck's writing are in what I assume his finest form. The incorporation of slang and half-witted conversations adds to the atmosphere of this novel . It essentially is a story of Lenny (a slow giant-like person), and George ( the quick and sharp brains of the two). The bond they share is quite unforgettable as the losses they both take paint a strong image of brotherhood between males.

B00003CXI1|5.0|I wonder if the author of \\"The Trouble with HARRY\\", an Amazon review of this movie, was talking of the movie or the books, or both. He/She says \\"classic is not a word\\" to be used when discussing or reviewing the Potter series of books or movies.<br />I must respectuflly disagree. While C.S. Lewis' novels of Narnia are widely purchased and presumptively read, they are a bit too moralistic for my taste. Lewis has a well-grounded Christian basis, but I prefer my moralizing more from the pulpit than from supposedly secular fiction.<br />As to Frank L. Baum's books on Oz. . .the first three or four were realitively imaginative and entertaining. After that, it was clear Baum, like his contemporary Edgar Rice Burroughs of \\"Tarzan\\" fame, was milking the series for every dime it could produce!<br />Rowling, on the other hand, has reconstructed a macro-cosmology, seated fully in her own unique imagination, and populated same with characters and events to serve her own literary &lt;you read it correctly, \\"literary\\"> aims. All I mean is that Ms. Rowling is telling her own story in her own way. She has no theological, philosophical, or even teleogical axe to grind that I can discover &lt;when asked what she based her \\"magic\\" on in the novels in a televised interview, Ms. Rowling looked both amused and somewhat confused! Her forthright answer was that she had simply \\"made it up!\\"><br />The movie version does the book proud! It essentially sticks to the book's plot, events, and sequence without losing the sense of innocence of childhood poised on the threshhold of adolescence while being faced with problems and situations of adult &lt;and beyond> proportions. Harry must make choices, and Ms. Rowling does not allow her creation to get away with making wrong choices without the accompanying consequences and results of such choices. Harry must study hard, work hard, choose correctly, and be true to himself and his friends, and his beliefs. Such sad, tramautic events, to be sure. . .but at least Harry ACTS. . .unlike Dorothy in Oz who simpers and whimpers her disire to go home.<br />Harry has friends, yes. But Dorothy has a deus-ex-machina to rescue her. Harry has to think and act for himself.<br />I love Dorothy and Toto. I don't care much for Lewis &lt;only because I find him preachy>.

B00005QZWI|5.0|I think this CD rules.  My favorite songs ar Concerning Hobbits,<BR>A Knife in the Dark (which scares me half to death, but rules), and The Breaking of the Fellowship(which makes me cry).  <BR>I think this CD deserves ten stars, but unfortunately, I can't.
B00004T9UF|5.0|After I first heard this Cd..I was blown away at the emotion that it brings...it will have you crying one minute and reaching for a chainsaw the next.....This is hands down the greatest rap album ever and possibly one of the greatest overall.....Em doesn;t hold back on anyone..anyone that crossed him during 99 heard about it here and I think thats is the coolest thing about him..alot of other artists have beefs with others but they hold it in or tell it in an interview...Em just sets it in stone for generations and generations
B00006CXXU|5.0|When I first bought the CD I listened to like 8 of the songs over and over again - which is impressive because with most CD's you can only find one or two great songs and the rest is [bad].  But I actually decided to listen to the tracks that didnt grab me the first few seconds you hear them (you know the ones you press the skip button after the first 15 seconds) anyways ---dangggggggggggggg!!!!  Holy cow!!! I am even more impressed with Christina Aguilera.  I give kudos to her for the songs I didnt initially like and now their on my repeat button!!!:<br />A Voice Within , Walk Away, I'm OK, UnderAppreciated, and Dirrty!!!<br />This album is definitely worth buying!!!  The best musical investment I have made.  It really is a album for all seasons - theres something for every mood.  I can't wait for the follow up - she is definitely underrated.

B00008972S|5.0|I saw this movie with my parents back in the 1970's.  I liked it and wanted to be \\"just like Maria.\\" I was ready to dye my hair brown and wear a pretty white dress every day for the rest of my life.  Now that I'm older, I still love this movie, but for different reasons.  The love story rips through my heart, the jets/sharks fight scene under the highway brings on an attack of anxiety, and the death scene can leave me emotionally exhausted for 2 days afterward.  This is a wonderfully made movie. Perfectly cast and beautifully presented.  I don't care who did the actual singing, it is flawless!  And I had no idea that it was dubbed until just last year.  If you didn't know that little tidbit of information, you wouldn't be able to tell it on your own. The singing voices match up perfectly with the actor's speaking voices. Don't watch this movie if you are looking for a realistic documentary, complete with graphic violence and language. Watch it if you care about the deeper message of love, understanding, and acceptance.
B000002H72|4.0|Timeless is one method of describing this band.  They arrived on scene early, thus became pioneers paving the way for most of today's gruge/alternative rock.  But the Pixies had a certain innovation about them, a style that is still distinct even today.  When you converge the raw-yet-melodic voice and lyrics of Frank Black with Kim Deal's supporting back-ups and walloping bass lines, Joey Santiago's pitched yet innovative leads (that are played constantly, not merely a mid-song solo), and David Lovering's smooth drums, you get a band with a sound all their own especially for that era.  Doolittle happens to be my favorite as a whole album.  It's creative, smooth, and a supreme display of the band's musical influences, offering converged elements of many different styles.  Whether a fan or potential fan, this is the album to buy because chances are, though Surfer Rosa, Pigrim, Trompe, and Bossonova, all have their advantages, you will not come across the same instillment of innovation and creativity as in this album.
B00005QDW5|3.0|Pink Floyd's &quot;Echoes&quot; and &quot;Is There Anybody Out There?: The Wall Live&quot; were horribly put together. I'm surprised Daivd Gilmour put up with this (especially the hissing sound through out &quot;Is There Anybody Out There?: The Wall Live&quot; (they should have a done a better mixing and production job on both, they felt rushed). I understand the reasons why they did the track order in &quot;Echoes&quot;, however, since the songs go back and forth in time periods, they should have made the sound more continuous. If they went with a chronological order, it would have made sense to stick with the original sound. But how the current track order is set on &quot;Echoes&quot;, the sound can be best described as intertemporal schizophrenia.  When it comes to band members, I firmly put myself in the David Gilmour camp. However, I do have a disagreement with him. In an issue of Mojo Magazine, he stated that he was not too interested in Roger's set list for &quot;Echoes&quot; because people do not want to listen to six tracks from the &quot;Final Cut&quot;. Well that is true, but it is also true that no one wants to listen to six tracks from the &quot;Division Bell&quot;, especially if the list does not include &quot;Poles Apart&quot; (a damn good song!).  In addition, they should have added &quot;Mother&quot; (live) from &quot;Is There Anybody Out There?: The Wall Live&quot;, which I think, is the best song on that album.  To this day, I am disappointed to have bought Pink Floyd's \\"Echoes - Best of\\". The Pink Floyd has a lot of great material out there and it would have been nice if they put some of their released and unreleased videos and tabs on an enhanced CD.  They have the respective videos out there and the sheet music to add to their CD's. As a listener, I would have loved to see the videos associated with the songs and as a guitarist, I would have loved to learn some of the solos. The marginal cost of doing this is near zero and it gives the person afuller experience.  &quot;Echoes&quot; was a missed opportunity to really deliver a great sounding off product to the Floyd's fans, because in reality, we should not expect anything new from the Pink Floyd.  However, I strongly encourage you to get &quot;David Gilmour Live in Concert DVD&quot; and &quot;Roger Waters In the Flesh&quot; DVD. Great products to add to the collection!<br />-Leo

B000089RVX|5.0|Most albums that I come across can easily fit into a certain category or readily compared to another artist.  \\"Fallen\\" doesn't do either, and that's great!  They blend rock, ethereal vocals, and strings to create a totally unique sound.  The songs seem to all generate from a place of \\"fallenness\\" and offer the reality of dealing with hard issues in life, but unlike other bands they seem to offer hope in spite of the trying situations the characters in the songs find themselves in.  I highly recommend this album, to anyone who loves music that breaks all molds.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence has just been welcomed into my very selective world of music!  They are simply wonderful, and Amy's voice is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard.  I'd highly reccomend this CD to fans of Lacuna Coil, Within Temptation, or Theatre of Tragedy.  I'd also reccomend those bands to fans of Evanescence, they are all so wonderful:).  In any case, I like this CD because it is alternative and the like without being depressing.  It isn't so dark and gloomy as it is dramatic.<BR>   Overall, it's a great CD made by a great band.

B00008AY3L|4.0|Let me start by giving my history with Ben Harper so you know where this review is coming from. I've been a fan of Ben's from the start. &quot;Welcome to the Cruel World&quot; was one of the best debut albums that I've ever heard, and &quot;Fight For Your Mind&quot; was even better. &quot;Will to Live&quot; I felt was solid, but a slight step backward for Ben. Nevertheless he had established himself as a young revolutionary and inheritor of virtually every American musical genre: Rock, Reggae, Folk, Funk, Blues, Jazz, and Gospel. Then there was &quot;Burn to Shine,&quot; the Ben Harper equivalent to Star Wars: Episode I.<br />I listen to it because it's Ben, not because it's good.<br />     \\"Diamonds on the Inside\\" is a step in the right direction. Musically it's much better than \\"Burn to Shine\\" and I might even go so far as to say it's the best it's ever been, but it's lacking in the political arena. Ben's first three albums form sort of a trilogy. Each album has three prime components: Political Songs, Spiritual Songs, and Love Songs. But \\"Diamonds on the Inside\\" continues the break started with \\"Burn to Shine.\\" Both lack the politics of the previous albums. For example, on &quot;Fight for Your Mind&quot; there's the title track, there's &quot;One Road to Freedom,&quot; &quot;When the People Lead,&quot; and &quot;Oppression.&quot; All incredible political songs. On \\"Diamonds on the Inside,\\" there's the song, \\"With My Own Two Hands,\\" which is very, very, good, but I want more.<br />     I want Ben to return to his political roots and as Marley sang, SAY SOMETHING!<br />     While Harper's politics are missing, his spirit is definitely there. If you liked \\"Waiting on an Angel,\\" \\"Power of the Gospel,\\" \\"I Want to be Ready,\\" or \\"In the Lord's Arms,\\" there's definitely a space for you on this album. \\"Amen Omen,\\" \\"Blessed to be a Witness,\\" and \\"Picture of Jesus,\\" are all very tight songs.<BR>     Basically, the album's solid, and, in my opinion, it's a sort of recovery album from &quot;Burn to Shine.&quot; It's definitely worth picking up after you have his first three albums, but I would highly recommend you pick up those first. I hope in the future, Ben returns to the political agenda that he established in his early albums. We need his voice now more than ever. I, of course, expect him to grow as an artist, but I also want him to stick to this roots. <br />COME HOME, BEN!<BR>We're waiting on you.
B00008GKEG|5.0|As a tremendous Beatles follower and admirer, I own all their albums and a good percentage of their solo work as well. I own various Beatles' videos, including the Anthology set. The Anthology (VHS) collection is simply brilliant and far greater--with an in-depth look at their career with various inerviews--than any other Beatle documentary previously compiled. <br />The DVD version will be far superior than that of the VHS version as it includes much bonus material including the \\"Real Love\\" video and insights on the making and reuniting of the Beatles. If you do not own this and are not just a Beatles fan, but a fan of music, good music, then do yourself a favour and pick up this DVD set. Tho, it may be a bit pricy, it will be well worth it!

B00007AJGH|5.0|Filmmakers have been combining animation and live action since the days of silent film--but 1988's WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT not only bested everything done previously, it set a standard that is unlikely to be surpassed.  Although it has been available on VHS and in a mediocre DVD release for quite a few years, the film finally gets the star treatment in this \\"Vista Series\\" double DVD release, which includes the film in both pan-and-scan and letterbox formats and an assortment of extras, many of which are quite interesting.<br /><br />The concept and story are well known: cartoon characters are not drawings, but are living entities who work in the film industry, and when Maroon Cartoon star Roger Rabbit is accused of murdering Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), he turns to private detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) for help.  Trouble is, Eddie hates \\"Toons.\\"  After all, one of them offed his brother, and Eddie hasn't been sober since.  The concept is a clever one, and the story could have gone in any number of directions--but ROGER RABBIT hops down a completely unexpected trail.  Set in 1947 Los Angeles, the film uses classic \\"noir\\" elements (and references everything from THE MALTESE FALCON to CHINATOWN); it also makes considerable sly social commentary on racism, with the \\"Toons\\" performing in a Cotton Club-like nightclub, literally working for peanuts at the studios, and more or less confined to living in \\"Toontown,\\" which might easily be read as social ghettoization.  And all of these sidelights are interesting and entertaining.  But the most attractive thing about ROGER RABBIT is that it is just plain fun to watch.<br /><br />Part of that fun comes from the marvelous performances of Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd (as the evil Judge Doom), and Joanna Cassidy (Valiant's sidekick Delores), who lead the live action cast.  Another chunk of the fun is the way in which the film cameos a host of famous cartoon characters, ranging from Betty Boop to Bugs Bunny and the Warner Bro.s gang to Dumbo--and animation buffs will love the fact that Betty Boop and Bugs Bunny, to name but two, are voiced by the artists (Mae Questel and Mel Blanc) who created the character voices in the first place.  But the big deal here is the extremely believable way in which the \\"Toons\\" fit into the real world.  They rendered with astonishing detail and remarkable three dimensionality.  It's just an amazing thing to watch.<br /><br />The overall DVD package is a bit odd, for it offers less in the way of bonuses than one might expect.  The first disk includes a pan-and-scan version of the film, three Roger Rabbit/Baby Herman shorts, a kid-friendly documentary, and a CD-ROM game; the second disk offers the letterbox film with extras that will appeal to more mature viewers, most particularly on-set shots and a nifty documentary called \\"Behind the Ears.\\"  The upshot is really a one-disk release that has been expanded to two by the trick of cramming both pan-and-scan and letterbox versions into a single package.  That's annoying--but even so, this is easily the best release of this film to date.  It at gives the rabbit some justice at last, and I give it five stars on that basis.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerro.s gang to Dumbo--and animation buffs will love the fact that Betty Boop and Bugs Bunny, to name but two, are voiced by the artists (Mae Questel and Mel Blanc) who created the character voices in the first place.

B00002E23E|3.0|I first saw this movie back in '77, and being a huge a fan of the group, I was both delighted and disappointed.  The group performed predictably well over the 3 nights at the Garden when they were filmed, but the live footage of the band was mediocre with too many close-up shots and not enough of the band performing as a whole.  (There's amateur bootleg video available of the group from '75 in Chicago that has the vantage point that I wish this movie had - single camera from the first row.)  With the exception of Plant's fantasy section during \\"The Rain Song\\", the others were distracting and disjointed, and only stole away from the performance.  (Fans may care to seek THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME outtake bootleg video, which has the \\"damsel in distress\\" role played by Plant's ex-wife, Maureen.)  Another major problem with the movie from an historical perspective is the somewhat outdated nature of the live material shown.  Back then, the group had the classic PHYSICAL GRAFFITI album out for 2 years when the movie was released, but none of that material was covered.  If they included footage from the '75 tour, that would have helped tremendously.  Also, if the band had performed an acoustic set during those shows, that also would have given the overall performance more flavor.  The addition of some offstage footage of the group (in their famous Starship jet, for example) would have added interest to the film.  One major plus with the movie is the inclusion of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", with didn't make it to the soundtrack album (but that's another review).  In summary, the movie would have been more enjoyable if it was longer and without the peripheral \\"fantasy\\" sequences.<br />  It's unfortunate that so little quality film footage is available from this legendary band, which by default makes this film the best live document available.  It's too bad that the group never performed at Woodstock, because their performance in that film would have been awesome.  (Note: The band was actually in the region during that week in August '69, performing in Canada.  DAMN!)  But, save for a few decent bootleg videos (Danish TV, Staines, Paris '69; Chicago, Inglewood '75, etc.), this film will unfortunately remain the best historical concert film document of Led Zeppelin, and as such should be regarded as indispensable.band was actually in the region during that week in August '69, performing in Canada.

B000001EHS|5.0|I listen to this CD more than any other I own, simply because every song on this is great (cept maybe Miss You in a Heartbeat). It has hard rocking songs and nice ballads, but with only 15 tracks, you don't get the whole Def Leppard experince. Here's a track by track rating and chart listing:<BR>1. Pour Some Sugar on Me- 10/10- #2<BR>2. Photograph- 10/10- #12<BR>3. Love Bites- 10/10- #1! the only #1 song from Leppard!<BR>4. Let's Get Rocked- 10/10- #15<BR>5. Two Steps Behind- 10/10- #12<BR>6. Animal- 10/10- #19 <BR>7. Foolin- 10/10- #28 <BR>8. Rocket- 10/10- #12 <BR>9. When Love and Hate Collide- 9/10- #58<BR>10. Armageddon It- 15/10! My fav. Leppard song! #3 on the charts!<BR>11. Have You Ever Needed Someone so Bad- 10/10- #12 <BR>12. Rock of Ages- 10/10- #16<BR>13. Hysteria- 10/10- #10<BR>14. Miss you in a Heartbeat- 8/10- #39- My least fav. song on the Vault- still good though<BR>15. Bringin on the Heartbreak-10/10 didnt chart- this was the song and video that made the band famous!<BR> <BR> This is an excellent greatest hits but I wish they would come out with a double disc and include songs like Hello America, Let it Go, Women, Stand Up, Heaven Is, Make Love Like A Man, Tonight, Wasted, High N Dry, Promises, Now, SLang, Work It Out, Gods Of War, Too Late For Love, Rock Rock, Back in your Face, Stagefright, Everyday, All I Want Is Everything, Mirror Mirror, Excitable, and Long Long Way to Go. Then, this would be amazing!
B00003CXAE|1.0|I wanted to preview this dvd before I bought it and thank goodness I did.  The big dissappointment was lack of extras.  Has hollywood gone very greedy.  I say yes.  The only extras are interviews. BIG DEAL.  What about commentaries, Making of,maybe bloopers.  I thought because it took such a long time for this to be released, the studio would have been working on a nice package with plenty of extras.  Not so here.  Hollywood is just so greedy I'm sure they might wait til they get suckers to buy this and then they will come out with a big package.  <br />   Another big problem ,in some scenes the ads in the background are unable to read.  The picture and sound are not up to DVD quality also.  Thank god I didn't have to pay to preview it either.  My advice is keep your VHS version.

B000002HAF|5.0|This is a warning.  The only problem with liking the Pixies is that:  All other music will for the rest of your life sound dull and ordinary and predictable.  With a few execptions including Radiohead,  all other rock music will just make you want to listen to a Pixies song.  All songs you hear will make you wish Frank Black would just magically appear on the track and scream to kick the song...  Buy this album and get into the Pixies and you will understand what I mean.
B000002GBD|5.0|This album (as they were called back then) had the most profound influence on me as I was growing up, I think I was 8 or 9 when I first heard it in my uncles Hot Rod, the most memorable song for me is \\"Miss Misery\\" when he cranked up that song in his car and we shot down the highway very fast, I remember thinking, This must be what Groovy means, I was totally blown away by the guitar as I've never heard anything like it before, I asked my Uncle what that sound was and he told me it was an Electric Guitar, that was it, I was in love with Rock 'N 'Roll, I believe Hair Of The Dog needs no introduction as it's the greatest rock song ever written, after finally converting to CD's last year, I had to have It on CD, but still treasure my Nazareth cassette tape collection, If only Nazareth produced more albums in this vein of music.......Do not let this CD escape it's place in your collection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000IMCV|4.0|This has to be my favorite of the three movie that were made by Geroge Romero. It kinda picks up where the origanal left off: a radioactive chemical has caused countless people to turn into zombies.. It starts with a news broadcast then turns to a cool (but brief) gunfight in a building with some bandits and cops which has a cool exploding head scene. Then the characters somehow meet and they leave the building. Then they stop for fuel and then its the mall, this one foucuses more on suspence then the action unlike the first one and it runs kinda long. Well they are all living in the mall when a huge gang of bikers lets the outside zombies in.... So all hell breaks loose. The only reason why I didnt give this one five stars is because of some really bad acting. But if you like some gore and good characters see this film.
0425170349|4.0|If your looking for a good book to read Rainbow six is it! Rainbow six has pleanty of action it with a great plot. I think this book will entertain you a lot if your into Tom Clancy's type of stories. I liked the book a lot because this book isnt boring as some of his other books. Sometimes Tom Clancy will go on and on with some people's thoughts but thats about the only bad part. Tom Clancy made a book that makes perfect sence for a possible futer terrorist attack. If you dont like Jack Ryan thats ok because he's hardly ever mentioned in this book. I can give you what the book is about but I dont want to give the story away either. This book is about a bunch of genuis terrorist trying to kill all humans on earth. These terrorist try to do it with an KGB. They make a bunch of terrorist attacks in Europe so the Rainbow team will focus mainly on those kind of attacks for the olympics in Sydney. Rainbow is like the SAS but they fight agains terrorism. There base is in England. Anyways when the Olympics arrive the terrorist try to kill the people by puting a deadly chemical called Shivia in a mist system to help cool off the people in the Olympic stadium. Of course you know the bad guys wont win but how they get caught is awesome. I recomend this book to you because once you start reading the book you wont stop reading it.
B000002AZ8|5.0|After thier amazing debut ten and thier weak (in my case) follow up vs, this kinda marked the end of thier SUPER stardom, every song on here is great (even bugs) and I REALLY like the opener last exit its a fast fun song that stays in your head for days spin the blck cirlce is good is. Better man I really liked at first but got boring after like 50 listens. Satans bed is a cool hard rock masterpiece and not for you is an anthematic charged up song with some great guitaring. However I didnt like aye davenita and pry to was good but there is better like tremor christ or whipping. Buy this, this is one album youll never negelcet.
B00006AUIG|3.0|I rented this movie because I am from Mass originally and had never heard of Danvers state. I must say some parts are a bit confusing...But all ties together in the end..what I liked mosy about it was the DVD version has Extras, They speak with the actors who actually were very creeped out to work in this place.I think its well worth renting and giving it a whirl...The whole abandoned Mental Hospital is creepy in itself!
B00005JKDQ|4.0|I highly recommend this movie for adults and children!  If you liked Shrek, you will also like this movie!
076780421X|4.0|I have to say, As Hockey as this movie can be...It was very Funny and Charming. Selma Hayek reminded me of ME in this movie...Very cute love story..Grab a blanket and you Fav Person and Enjoy.
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanescence approaches its music and songwriting with a degree of seriousness and care that's none too common these days.  The songs are aggressive yet catchy, with an ear for build and drama; Amy Lee's vocals are arresting, beautiful yet with a hard edge, especially exhilarating when she soars into her upper register, and Ben Moody's guitar crunch provides excellent counterpoint to her melodic voice.  Lyrics are intelligent and flowing, not just sulking for sulking's sake, with a distinct spiritual edge which enriches their thematic palette.<br />As worthy as the last major album in this style, A Perfect Circle's excellent debut album.  Lee and Moody's approach to their craft are truly heartening and I'm sure I'll be following their music for years to come.
B00004RFFS|4.0|This Movie has it all. Anne rice is a master at Vampire writing. Tom Cruise, Brad pitt, The whole cast, did it a great justice. Very well acted, it has it all sex appeal, intrigue, sadness, I truly loved this film.
B00008DDXC|4.0|You'll enjoy it a lot more if you've read the book.  Otherwise, I don't think there's anything crafty about it, but it's tons of fun.  The major drawback to the film is something I've never encountered in a movie before--an overwhelming musical score.  The music is so overdone, so dramatic, so loud, that it distracts from the movie.  I've never actually been in a movie where such a thing was noticeable before, so I thought it was very unusual.
0800177177|5.0|I loved this Version Of Dracula..Gary Oldman truly did the part justice...I loved the steamyness of it...the passion..and somewhat erotic parts to it. I thought it very good and well worth Owning..which I do. The part of Lucy was a tad poorly acted, But wynona ryder and Keanu Reeves made up for it. The story is Dark..and keeps your eyes wondering whats coming next!
B00003Q43A|3.0|Will Smith is tons of fun in this movie along with Jeff Goldblum.  The movie isn't art or literature, but it's a fun ride.  Of course, in the wake of 9/11 and the crises we are facing these days, I think it loses a lot of its punch.  This movie was made back in the day when such things were only imaginary.
B0000024K1|5.0|When this album was released it influenced and raised the consciousness of hip hop youth and therefore hip hop culture. Public Enemy used their music in an effort to inspire black nationalism thru black radicalism by any means necessary. They were considered to be the hip hop versions of Malcom X.Chuck D. spit hard knowledge based lyrics over even harder beats. P.E. inspired millions of frustrated black youth to take control of their destiny's thru positive community involvement and self improvement. Their music instilled a sense of pride in being black and spoke about having an obligation of improving the race. You can't love others without first loving yourself. This album was innovative and deep without being preachy. I remember that I was forever changed by this album. It inspired me to look beyond the limited amount of information ,concerning african americans, that was being fed to me in school. I realized that the reach of african american contributions to this country and civilization extends farther than we are led to believe. It is a shame that to a certain extent that message has been lost in a lot of music today. This is classic and should be in your collection if you are a serious hip hop head.
6304806426|2.0|This movie has beautiful cinematography, nice acting, and an unusual setting. The plot did not grip me and I found the love story to be ho-hum because of the way its told in flash back.  I know a lot of people really loved it, and if you're someone who likes sophistocated stories you might love it to.  But if you're a boring American like me, the pacing isn't fast enough and the movie is very long.<br />The one TRULY exceptional part of this film, however, is its score. Buy it!
B00008AY3L|3.0|Ben Harper is an amazing musician, especially live.  Diamonds on the Inside has a few good tracks, but just as many poor ones.  Harper's earlier albums contain more thoughtful lyrics, and are better overall.  After Ben's last two works, Live from Mars and Burn to Shine, it's hard not to be dissapointed by his new efforts.
038533348X|5.0|If the worst thing you can say about a book is that you wish it was longer, then, hey, that's not too bad, right?<br />I mean, I can recognize wonderful writing more than I can produce it so I won't write much here. But the book is good. Buy it. You won't be sorry.
B000089RVX|4.0|... but I love this album. If I were to base my decision to like or dislike this album based solely on the reviews I see here, I would hate it, since everyone has said that they are a bunch of linkin park clones with a female vocalist. This is not even vaguely true. The only possible evidence for that is the rapper who chimes in occassionally on Bring Me to Life. <br />That leads me to an important point. The rapper is only in Bring Me to Life. He makes no appearance anywhere else in the CD, so if you only like Rap-Rock, you may as well skip this CD. Ok, I will grant that my extreme dislike of Linkin Park means that I am not more than passingly familiar with their music, but not a single song on this album is anything like any Linkin Park song I've ever heard. <br />Anyway, on to the review.<br />This album is very very likable. Since I'm not a musical expert, I won't say that they are definately an original kind of band, but they are certainly something different than everything else you hear on the radio. They have some gothic, techno, and rock influences. And I would definately say that Amy Lee's voice has some influence from Tori Amos. They are most definately a good band. This is a good debut from them and I look forward to anything else that they do.
B00004R9A4|2.0|I absolutely loved this movie when I was young (and still do), so naturally when I saw it was released on DVD I purchase it.  The video quality of this DVD is absolutely superb!  They did a decent job of translating this movie to DVD.  However, the reason I'm giving it two stars is because of the movie's horrible voice-overs.  Apparently some of the audio has been lost over the years; consequently Disney needed to add in voice acting in places where the dialogue is missing.  (it starts appearing about midway through)  So what's wrong with voice-overs?  Nothing if they are done right.  However, Disney spent a whole five minutes on these.  They are absolutely *horrid*!  They do not sync up with the actors lips and in 90% of the shots they don't even sound like the original voice.  The least they could have done was try to make the voices sync with the lip movements.  So do I recommend this DVD?  Personally, I would say no.  Disney needs to stay away from redoing old movies.  However, if you can stand horrible voice-overs through the second half of the movie then by all means buy it!  It's still a great movie despite what they've done to it!  Worth at least a rental to see if you like it.
B00006NSGX|5.0|This  CD is  great  because of  the musicians  who play the songs. It would be  so  strange to  have  Billy and Greg  on  keyboards  and  dont  give him  the space  that  they deserves.  Nathan  East  is  also a good choice. Anyone  who  likes  good  rock and roll  will  enjoy  this  record.
B00005JLRT|4.0|One thing is certain in Star Trek that seems to have been forgotten - the chemistry of the cast and story. Nemesis was a failure at the box office and I'm scratching my head as to...why? The 10th installment brought back the chemistry of the cast and brought forth a story rivaling, although not succeeding, The Wrath of Khan. There's no Borg this time, no deadly Klingons, or any probe that wants to find whales. However, we have realism.<br />Commander Riker has just married Counselor Troi and has been promoted to Captain with his own ship, but before they can get to Troi's homeworld, a call comes in from the Romulan Empire. A lot of people thought with some news on the marriage that it would be this gigantic portion of the movie, albeit it is not and takes up only 3 minutes worth of screen time. Schinzon, a clone of Captain Picard, has eliminated the Romulan Senate and seeks peace with the Federation from the dark side of Remus. Of course, we can all gather that peace is the last thing on this guy's mind. What develops is a story reminiscent of The Wrath of Khan, yet very dark and twisted...what I mean by that is clearly, everything is not on the table at once and the gorgeous locations are...well, shot in an eerie light.<br />You'll find here some throwbacks, a Genesis-type device that actually is an entire ship, some Spockism's, and an ending fitting to the nautical nature of what Star Trek really has been, only sidelined in the past few movies. If you like drama mixed in with one of the best space battles I've seen in recent memory, you'll want to see this. I don't want to give away the spoilers, but the depth of the battles and twists of fate are worthy of high appreciation. This isn't like #9 where you could go the restroom and sit for 20 minutes and come back. It pins you to the seat. I would venture that if you miss, aside from the marriage, a few minutes, you'll need to catch-up with the person next to you or watch it again.<br />The characters have different roles this time. Riker is the outgoing First Officer and Data has been chosen to replace him. Although, during the movie, Riker is still Number One due to the situation. Worf plays a minuet role in this film very much like Uhura in ST: III and Dr. Crusher doesn't have the onscreen time she did in the previous 2 movies. There is an interesting appearance by Admiral Janeway of Voyager fame.<br />Ok, so now you may be wondering why I'm reviewing a DVD version of the movie. Simply, I caught a last run of this in a small theater and it's fair to say the movie has all but finished the theatrical run. Other than the deleted scenes and extra's they put in as fillers for a DVD, I have not seen a movie drastically changed from theatrical to video. My review is of the movie. The Motion Picture, Wrath of Khan, and Search for Spock have their additions, yet they're Director's Cuts. I hope you enjoy this movie when you get to see it, or see it again, because I was inclined to go in with an opinion not to like it. The reviews were horrible for it when it was released...and after seeing it, I cannot understand...why.<br />Robert Eldridge (...)nt roles this time.

B000002L99|5.0|The reviewers that slag this album seem more like David lee Roth fans than true-blue Van Halen fans. To dislike the music is one thing, but hating it just cause David Lee Roth's not singing is absurd. And Comparing the Hagar era to the Roth years is apples to oranges! <br />The only dud here is \\"Inside\\" though you get the impression that the boys were really enjoying themselves. Eddie's top-notch guitar skills are evident on \\"Get up\\", plus there's clever boxing references thrown in. The two ballads \\"Dreams\\" and \\"Love walks in\\" are amazing. I always crank up \\"Summer Nights\\" around my birthday in June. Ideally sets the mood. The songwriting is incredible on both the title track and \\"Best of both worlds\\".<br />A few have complained that today 5150 Sounds dated. So what if they opted for synthesizers? That's harsh criticism, Those were the times. Who WASN'T using 'em at one point back then? And besides it was done so effectively it's hard to argue with that choice.
B00003CXC7|5.0|A film destined for over-analysis, &quot;Rear Window&quot; deserves it's place in the pantheon of great films.<BR>Instead of thinking about it so much, just watch the film and surrender to it's lovely storytelling style. It's like unfolding an origami bird to see what's on the original square piece of paper. (Notice I didn't say origami &quot;crane&quot;, because that would be more apropos for another film circa 1960.)<BR>The acting is superb, the script is unusually crafty, and the quips are appropriately tension-easing. The film attracts attention to it's style, yet manages to make you succumb to it. <BR>We KNOW Hitchcock is a master. It's just nice to be reminded time and again, isn't it?
B00000634J|1.0|Another cynical attempt by Yoko Ono, the millionaire, to take your money by recycling yet again Lennon's work.  I guess the baby-boomers can afford it, right?  Let's face it, John Lennon's post-Beatle solo career was an utter failiure.  His five year break in the late seventies was a career move, nothing more and nothing less.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica only hinted at greatness on their previous two albums, but it wasn't until late 1985, when they went into the studio and cranked out Master of Puppets. The musicality of the band was at its peak, arguably, and created some of the most interesting, and profound music of their entire career. With topics like drug addiction (the title track), mental illness (Sanitarium), war (disposable heroes), and religion (Leper messiah). The lyrical content was great, but the music was even better. They were still heavy, but they really had an incredible sense of melody, like the acoustic intro to \\"Battery,\\" the middle section of \\"MOP\\" and of course, \\"Orion,\\" one of the best rock instrumentals ever, especially the middle part, with Cliff Burton's haunting bass lines, Kirk Hammett's incredible solos, and Lars Ulrich doing what he does best... supplying simple rhythms. <BR>Master of Puppets is definitely the greatest heavy metal album of the 1980s, and one of the best metal albums ever(surpassed by Paranoid by Black Sabbath, and a few early Iron Maiden albums). Sadly, it was to be Cliff Burton's last album with the band, since he died in a bus accident in September 1986. It's a fitting epitaph, by hearing the funeral-inspired bass intro to \\"Damage Inc,\\" and the haunting \\"Orion.\\" Metallica never topped Master of Puppets, and probably never will.
B000002UAU|1.0|I am a big fan of progressive rock.  What I don't understand is how people can rip Yes, King Crimson, etc to pieces and how they can be barred from entering the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Yet, this pile of pop-garbage is hailed as the greatest thing since sliced bread.  This album stands as a monument to the self-righteous, bloated image of the horrible baby-boomer demographic.  How can people say this is visionary music, and in the same breath deride a true genius like Robert Fripp?  Face it, the Beatles are nothing more nor less than the 1960's N'Sync.  And why are all Beatles cd priced so high?  Because they know they can fool the conumer into buying this tripe.  This disc makes a good coaster and nothing more.  Don't waste your money. Thank you for reading this.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|Van Halen's 1978 eponymous debut is one of the best guitar albums in the history of rock, and has a collection of some of the most energetic songs in their career. In fact, many of the songs on this album are regularly played on rock radio, like \\"Runnin With The Devil,\\" \\"Jamie's Cryin,\\" and their version of the Kinks' \\"You Really Got Me.\\" <br />Eddie Van Halen's blistering riffs are the highlight on the album, definitely, even when David Lee Roth's vocals border on annoying (like in the liast 2 songs), and he is credited for introducing the finger-tapping technique to the mainstream (though Genesis' Steve Hackett also used it in the early 1970s). His solos on \\"Eruption\\" are almost impossible to duplicate, and his solos on songs like \\"Ain't Talking About Love\\" only add to the adrenaline rush produced by the band's music. It only gets 4.5 stars because the last 2 songs are sub-par, but it's one of the most essential hard rock albums ever, and a good album to getif you're into excellent guitar playing. Also kudos to Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony for supplying an adequate rhythm section.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought this C.D. after listening to &quot;your body is a wonderland&quot; on the radio. I totally didnt think Id enjoy it that much, but now I love this music. I listened to every track and even went out and bought more c.d.'s to quinch my thirst for his incredible music. It's not really like too much that's out there nowadays, but I am reminded slighty of Dave Matthews when I turn on his C.D. I suggest this C.D. to anyone who is a fan or wants to get into a music scene that is like none other. This 25 year old is very talented and I think you should absolutely give him a try!
0920668372|5.0|My daughter loves this book. She thinks it's funny when the little boy makes a mess of the bathroom, and when hes a teenager she thinks he looks silly. This book has helped her to understand that I will always lover her no matter what she does. I cry every time I read it, and I don't think this story is weird at all.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|It all started , for me , with Meet the Beatles. And this album is the climax. The best, the real deal, the Right way. We'll just say I've bought 23 copies for people and I have a CD burner.
0694003611|5.0|Of the hundreds of books that we read to our children when each of them were 5 and under, this was the best. Seeing the cover of the book takes me back to that feeling of having a child in jammies snuggled up next to me, hearing the story before bedtime. The illustrations are heart-warming. A rabbit is getting ready for bed. On each page, he says goodnight to something. A mouse is hidden on each page, and kids love to find it.<br />Buy this book if you have children who like bedtime stories. My children never tired of hearing this and I never tired of reading it to them.

B000002KHH|5.0|I am 49 now, so I was 17 when this album went out, and when I heard it first time. I still remember the thrill and the thought \\"it's the fullest energy and expression rock music can achieve\\". While I always was rather into prog and experiments and loved Moody Blues, ELP, Wishbone Ash but also Can or Captain Beefheart I remember I also loved all these early heavy rock masterpieces like Zep, Purple or Budgie. But over time (with some exceptions) I found most of them rather irritating and hard to go through as a whole. Paranoid is an exception, and it is one of these very few hard rock/metal albums I still listen to quite often and almost with the same thrill. Of course, it is hard to clearly explain why you feel this way or another (you simply can't describe emotions, true?), but let us bring some arguments in favour of this album:<BR>- it's very experimental and ahead of it's time. Dark and ominous, not only it is a blueprint for all later heavy metal (which I personally do not care so much for), but also for gothic and hard electro sound, all music dealing with dark, sinister themes. If not directly musically, then at least spiritually, Paranoid set the new boundaries for all these experiments. I am pretty sure, every musician on the dark side had to listen to this masterpiece and appreciate it.<BR>- The greatest riffs ever. If rock music IS riffs, there are plenty of these here. And all so cool, so memorable. And often one song is based on many cool riffs! Paranoid (song) or War Pigs are the coolest riffs in rock history, no Zep or Purple album can match THESE riffs.<BR>- Relentless, driving rhythm section of Butler/Ward. While critics argue Jones/Bonham or Glover/Paice were more profound technically and it might be even true, Butler and Ward with Iommi's guitar are the most CONSISTENT here. There is no moment of [bad performance]! Some complain about Rad Salad and drum solo! But it's short and very cool, never leads to excess!<BR>All in all the best hard rock/metal album ever, and maybe the only you really need :-)<BR>Let's rate the individual songs:<BR>War Pigs - maybe the best here. Complex, multipart dark rocker with bouncy rhythms and countless great riffs. Everybody's got to love it. Maybe the lyrics are too straightforward sometimes (and the rhymes like masses ....masses sound a bit funny), but, man, it's an anti-war hymn. It must impress and do it straight! Are Bob Dylan's anti-war hymns so complex?<BR>So I actually like these lyrics. Enough said 10/10<BR>Paranoid - THAT's riff. Even hard radio overplay did not destroy this song. A classic 10/10<BR>Planet Caravan - another great, great song. I love the eerie, cosmic feel here. The lyrics are great, reflecting the feelings we all experience while watching the stars and the moon under the cloudless sky, everything so quiet as we and the Earth travel through the endless universe... I love the strange, distorted vocals, and fine, soft, masterful jazz guitar solo near the end. 10/10<BR>Iron Man - another radio classic. It's another complex, multipart song, but not the favourite of mine. Maybe it's overplay, maybe the stupid, cartoonish story reminds me too much of cheap science fiction (I hate cheap science fiction while I love GOOD SF). Maybe the main melody and rhythmic pattern sound all a bit [silly] to me...Still a classic, so can't be less than 9/10<BR>Electric Funeral - the most ominous song here. Slow, sludgy, gloomy. A warning against nuclear disaster, very suggestive, impressing picture of final extermination of mankind. <BR>Not a classic, but good song nevertheless 8/10<BR>Hand of Doom - a song against heroin abuse. I like the first, slow part, but the song becomes a little bit overlong in the middle. Good, impressive lyrics. Another good song 9/10<BR>Rat Salad - mostly, a drum solo. A short one, don't be afraid... And a good one 7/10<BR>Fairies Wear Boots - another favourite. Great bluesy intro, funny, tongue-in -cheek story, great riff.\\" ...So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me. He said, \\"Son, son you've gone too far 'Cos smokin' an trippin' is all that you do\\". Yeah\\" Oh, Yeah 10/10<BR>A desert island album, must own. Go buy it now.
0375757295|4.0|Though not as well known as the novels that established the author's name (Pride and Prejudice, Emma), Persuasion is certainly worth your time.  It's extremely well-written with superb characterization.  The plot isn't too original by today's standards, but is interesting nonetheless.  Anne Elliot, the smartest and most pleasant by far of three upper class sisters, is 28 and still single.  At 19 she fell in love with and almost married a dashing naval officer named Frederick Wentworth.  However, great pressure from her family and relations &quot;persuaded&quot; her to reject Frederick due to his lower station in society.  Frederick was greatly hurt and promptly went off to engage his energies in naval action.<br />Eight and a half years later, Anne still hasn't met another guy she likes as much as Frederick and remains single.  But now Frederick returns from war, retired, extremely wealthy from privateering with mercenaries, and more mature.  He's ready to settle down and a chance family connection puts him back in the same neighborhood as Anne!  He's still upset with Anne.  And this time, other women are catching his eye too...<br />While not up to the standards of Anne Bronte's outstanding The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Persuasion is a good classical romance novel.  I think it beats out Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd on plot and characterization, though Hardy's prose is generally more powerful.  Nevertheless, Austen can be quite poignant when she wants to be: Wentworth's shocking letter to Anne at the end of the book moved even me, a generally left-brained emotionless creature!<br />A highlight of the novel is the illuminating social commentary that Austen subtly inserts into the prose.  Clearly, she felt that the class system entrenched in British society at the time had its shortcomings.  The endnotes in the Penguin edition do a good job of explaining the finer points of Austen's many jabs at class-conscious folks including Anne's self-absorbed father Walter and hopeless sister Elizabeth.  Anne's other sister Mary is rendered superbly by Austen as a basically good-natured woman unfortunately marred by a touch of vanity.  I personally know a Mary or two.<br />Recommended to all adult readers!
B00005JKED|5.0|This movie was rediculously amazing. Everything about it was just awsome. The acting and the story was amazing. This is a DVD everyone should own. I already own 4 copies.

B000066C1N|2.0|Would have much preferred just the music. Bryan Adams should have left the gravel voice to Rod McKewin. No doubt the lyrics aided in the telling of the movie but they just do not stand alone.  Don't waste your money on this one if it is only attractive because of Hans Zimmer reputation

B000063CPL|5.0|Excellant sound, rewrote their epics, and play better live than anyone I've ever seen. I think it goes right up there with Live After Death.
B00005QK3B|5.0|I arrived to this album on the end of the 80's. It was not a straight way: I heard Incommunicado on the radio, liked it, and bought the live album \\"The Thieving Magpie\\". It took me some time to listen to the 2nd CD of the album (Misplaced Childhood Parts 1&amp;2). Only after listening Kayleigh and Lavender on an old Fiat of a friend (a big aficionado), I played the CD. From then on, it took them a short period of time to become my favorite band, even after Fish's departure.<br />You smell inspiration in the whole album, starting with the lyrics. Together with Steve's guitar play, the lyrics are one of the highlights of the album. Fish was living on the edge those days (see the booklet included on the 2 disc version to find details of the recording months in Berlin), but his writing and interpretation were at their best!<br />When you enjoy Misplaced Childhood as I do, it's very hard to point out isolated songs. Both parts are so well connected between themselves that you'll soon find out other musical moments as beautiful as the singles that came out.<BR>Childhoods End? is probably my favorite of those moments. Bitter Suite is also a brilliant song, divided in 3 magnificent parts: a first one very personal (Brief Encounter), a second one with very strong lyrics (Lost Weekend), and a third one simply perfect (Blue Angel). White Feather ends the album (and the childhood period) in a way I would define as a positive song, with a message of youth's inconformity and hope.<br />After this album, music gained a new place in my life.
B00001ODHF|5.0|Army of Darkness is one of those flicks that MUST be watched on VHS. There is no way a DVD could make it better; it's the best it could be. The coolest thing about it is that originally it wasn't intended to be funny. Bruce Campbell added his comic skills to it and made it among the coolest (not necessarily BEST) movies ever made.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Absolutely brilliant British actors in a wonderful movie.  The children are a bit more polished, though Radcliffe's performace is still a tad stiff.  Wonderful effects (loved the Quidditch, the spiders terrified me), but Isaacs and Branagh are a delight to watch.  Its a good thing they were never in a scene togehter, or something would have exploded.  As it was, the dueling scene sparked with Rickman and Branagh, and I almost died from the sexy badness of Isaacs in all of his scenes.  Harris' performance is much better than the first movie, and its a shame that we will not see him anymore.  I did miss a few scenes-the Halloween party and the Valentines Day scenes namely, but everything fit together pretty seemlessly, and I can't wait for the fourth when Isaacs makes his return.
059035342X|4.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone<BR>By: J. Rowling<BR>Reviewed by: J. Manzon<BR>Period: 2<BR>  This book is about a boy named Harry Potter learning about his past and who was his parents. He also learns how to do magic. Such as Fly on a broom or do potions. He also goes to a school called Hogwarts to learn about magic.<BR>  I liked this book because of its ups and downs with the story line. Like this Quote\\" ... yes- ! broomsticks!we've got catch the key to the door!\\" I also like the part about harry getting a letter and then leters pour in because he didn't get to read one.<BR>  I dislike the parts of the book when it was boring. Like in the begining. i didn't relly get it.<BR>  My most favorite part of the book is when Hagrid comes and breaks down the door of the light house and gives Harry the letter about Hogwarts
B00006JJ1O|4.0|200 KM/M in the Wrong Lane is an extraordinary cd. I enjoyed listening to it.  The lyrics are realistic and represented my feelings so well, which is why i think i love it so much. Aside from the moving lyrics, the music is great! There are great beats and the variety of instruments used in the music go great with their voices.  This cd is also fun to dance to, if you're into techno beats.  In conclusion, i absolutely love this cd and can't wait to hear more from these talented girls!
B000089RVX|4.0|This is a solid CD and every track is a poppy sensation. However, there is a serious lack of depth characteristically found in any Gothic production. I'm assuming Evanescence is a Gothic Rock band because of obvious reasons (getup, sound, etc). The female vocalist sounds strangely the same as Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil, an Italian Gothic Metal band that you guys should all listen to. I recommend Tristania and Theatre of Tragedy as well. This is a great debut effort, and I'm happy that Evanescence has captured a sound that makes the Gothic genre very assessible to the general public. We'll see how they evolve in their sophomore release.

B00008AY3L|4.0|I will start of by saying that this album is probably his third best, behind Fight For Your Mind and Will To Live. However, I consider those two albums to be among the best in my collection, so that 3rd place ranking doesn't really mean anything negative. The variety of genres that this album reaches, shows the amazing musicianship that Ben Harper and The Innocent Criminals have. Lyrically this is yet another amazing piece of work by Ben. Bob Dylan and Paul Simon are the two best lyricists I have ever hear, but Ben Harper is in my top five. This album has a lot of songs dealing with spirituality/religion, as well as a love motif running throughout. People say that this is a more mainstream album when compare to Ben's other albums. I wouldn't say that it is more mainstream than Burn To Shine, in fact, it is less 'pop'. And, if this is the direction mainstream music is headed, then I'm all for the change. Peace.
B00008RH3L|5.0|The Coen brothers are about as close as we have come in recent generations to a level of artistry and achievement equal to that of Shakespeare. The richness of language, plotting, and character and the breadth and detail of their work is nothing short of phenomenal! <br />And for me at least, Miller's Crossing is their masterpiece. I have watched it many times, and each time I catch some new bit of information or see a story angle or acting nuance that enriches the movie for me. I admire many cinema works, but this one (along with Raising Arizona and to a lesser degree other works by the Coens) is among the few that remain fresh and entertaining even after multiple viewings.<br />One suggestion; because the actors employ a diverse set of accents and because the language is steeped in a vernacular that takes some getting used to, at some point you may want to watch it with subtitles to be sure you catch the subtleties and nuances of the story.<br />I'm glad it's coming out on DVD. My video might not have lasted through many more viewings.

B000002LCD|5.0|Madonna's film career has never really taken off, despite being launched way back in 1985 with Desperately Seeking Susan. In 1987, she starred in the flop film Who's That Girl. The film showed strong promised, but basically flopped worldwide. The soundtrack to the film, however, was the bigger hit of the two and went on to sell 8 million copies worldwide, and includes some pretty big hits. Granted, the soundtrack isn't Madonna's best - I'm Breathless is - but this is a worthy album for any Madonna fan's collection. If you're a Madonna fan and were thinking of purchasing this record without hesitation, beware! The album has only nine songs on it - and only four of those are by Madonna herself. The others are by lesser-known acts such as Duncan Faure, Club Nouveau, Michael Davidson, Scritti Politti and Coati Mundi! Because of this - and because the record says \\"Madonna\\" at the top - I will only be reviewing the songs by Madonna...<br /><br />Who's That Girl starts with the massive UK No.1 single of the same name, Who's That Girl (10/10). It topped the UK chart in July 1987 and was also a US No.1. The song has some fun lyrics and the bassline and beats are very traditional of Madonna's musical style at the time - very upbeat, poppy and fun. Causing A Commotion (10/10) is the next song. Released in September of 1987, the song peaked at No.4 in the UK and was a big hit with audiences at Madonna's \\"Who's That Girl?\\" World Tour in 1987. The song has the usual big beats and catchy, funky and melodic beats to groove around to. The Look Of Love (9/10) is another excellent mid-tempo ballad from Madonna, which peaked at No.9 in the UK in December 1987. The lyrics, \\"No where to run/No where to hide/From the look of love/From the eyes of mine,\\" are not only catchy, but instantly recognisable. The bassline is heavy and the beat has a great \\"bouncy\\" feel to it. The final song from Madonna on Who That Girl - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is Can't Stop (9/10). This song is yet another superb pop dance hit from Madonna. It was never released as a single, like the other three songs I have just written about, but it definitely deserved to be. At almost five minutes, it's the longest song on this soundtrack which gives you more time to get into it. The song sounds almost identical to Where's The Party or Love Makes The World Go Round from Madonna's 1986 release, True Blue. The beat is bouncy, Madonna's voice is on top-form and the vocal arrangement is genius. OK, the lyrics aren't exactly the best in the world - but that doesn't matter! Live a little! Get up and get your groove on to Madge!<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />The full title of this CD is Madonna \\"Who's That Girl - Original Movie Soundtrack.\\" I didn't refer to it as this all the way through the review because, well, it'd take up al the space! The songs by Madonna on this CD are all excellent, and the songs by those other artists are rather good too. The cover of the CD has to be the worst CD cover I have ever seen! Madonna's hair is all scratty and scruffy, her lips are too red, the mole is obviously fake - and those eyebrows are hideous! Who on Earth has eyebrows that bushy?! Anyway, you're not buying the CD to look at the cover! You're buying it to listen to the superb music of Madonna! ...uperb pop dance hit from Madonna.

0385335482|5.0|Although I do not fall into the category of the typical woman, who spends &amp; doesn't have a way to pay for her spending, I found this book hilarious! I have a sister-in-law in Canada who reminded me of this author and am thinking of buying the book for her - hopefully, she too will find it amusing &amp; not offensive.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I was blown away when I saw this movie. I had no idea that any of the three stars had that much musical talent in them. Catherine Zeta-Jones blew me away with her dancing ability (especially since she was pregnant during the filming!!!) and both she and Renee are very well cast. Richard Gere also was a surprise. He does a mean tap dance number. I will be in disbelief if anyone doesn't fall in love with this movie.
B00004XMV6|5.0|The first time I saw this I was about 15. I watched it just for the purposes of getting aroused. By the end of the film I was blown away (pardon the pun). This is one of the movies that made me want to become a filmmaker. I didn't think it was possible to make a movie that was both very erotic and at the same time you could feel very involved with the characters to the point were your almost crying. You know these two are only going to date for 91/2 weeks, but you so want them to stay together. Excellent soundtrack. Perfectly acted. It's one of the films that made me want to become a filmmaker. I was also impressed, at the time I first watched it, that a movie could be so wonderfully made and at the same time very low-budget. If the producers of the film ever read this, please re-release it. On a final note I want to say that I think a big part of the genius of the movie comes from the fact that not all characters and situations are fully explored. This helps inhance the mystery of Micky's character.
B00006J3T4|5.0|I was an early fan of Mark Knopfler and Dire Straights, but then fell into a long period of not buying music.  On a whim I recently purchased, &quot;The Ragpicker's Dream&quot;, and wondered why I've been depriving myself all these years.  This album seems at first somewhat too soft and spare. I found myself becoming impatient with the understated style, wishing for some more powerful, raucous riffs.  After a few listenings, however, I began to appreciate the deep textures and the sweet and subtle power that exudes from Mark's voice and instrument. Just like someone whispering, this music invites and requires the listener to stop and pay attention, and reveals it's magic slowly a little bit each time.  I'm sure that I will continue discovering little bits of genius hidden away in plain sight.
B00008BXJF|4.0|This latest CD from King Crimson is pretty good stuff. It is generally gloomy in tone, but what else would you expect from Robert Fripp. If he smiled and no one was around to see it happen, would his face still crack?<br />The title track is presented in four parts, once as an Adrian Belew a capella opener, once with Belew's vocal track laid over ambient synth washes as a coda, and twice as legitimate contributions to the album's content.<br />\\"Level Five\\" is an OK instrumental plod-rocker with a discordant theme, very reminiscent of the heavier numbers from the 73-75 Crimson, circa \\"Red.\\" As relentless as it is, I guess it's a good thing KC had the heart to place the softer \\"Power To Believe I\\" as an intro to break us in before unleashing this hard, cold and soulless number.<br />KC warms up with a slightly jazzy Belew vocal almost-ballad, \\"Eyes Wide Open,\\" followed by a nifty instrumental \\"Elektrik\\" which like so many past Crimson tracks, takes a simple riff and explores it in various tempos and textures.<br />Like the opening and closing versions of the title track, the short instrumental \\"Facts of Life Intro\\" doesn't really stand on its own. It's hard to imagine the point of separating it from \\"Facts of Life,\\" unless the thinking is that \\"Facts\\" is a better candidate for airplay as a shorter song divested of its intro. Since \\"Facts\\" offers up a good groove some entertaining lyrics and some truly nasty guitar solos, I suppose that is a possibility.<br />We are then treated to \\"The Power to Believe II\\" which is the CD's standout track. It nicely blends ambient-style Robert Fripp with Trey Gunn's world music leanings. As moody as the rest of the album, though there is a ray of light that streams in through the cracks, courtesy of Pat Mastelotto's tuned percussion and the warm processed guitar tones. Dark and mysterious, but mysteriously inviting.<br />\\"Dangerous Curves\\" is curiously mis-named, since the instrumental presents no curves. It does sound dangerous, though. Mellotron tones over a foreboding march in ever-escalating tension. The emotions induced are six minutes of anxiety and fear, relieved only by crashing chords at the bitter end.<br />\\"Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With\\" is new-metal in style, but with sarcastic lyrics about poor songwriting and performing techniques. It seems to celebrate Korn and similar bands while poking a stick in their eye. Kind of funny in a \\"Weird Al\\" sort of way. Another bit of light in the darkness. But only a little.<br />The CD closes with two more go-arounds for the title track, Part III featuring synthesizer, e-bow guitar and off-beat percussion melded together to become another plodding atmospheric apprehension inducing slow rocker.<br />To summarize, \\"The Power To Believe\\" accomplishes its intended goal, to well up some fear and foreboding and to increase the anxiety level of the listener, always with interesting arrangements and a variety of styles.
0679731725|5.0|Ishiguro has created a wonder- he has managed to cram the evolution of the British mentality over the past hundred years into a deceptively simple plot.  By adopting an impeccable tone that is remarkably frank yet taut with the propriety and repression that one associates with the ideal butler, he presents the collapse of the early twentieth century concept of the gentleman.  The book is far more than a treatise on England, however.  It is a distinctly human story of a man questioning everything that he has believed in and strived for in his life.  More than simply asking whether he has succeeded, Stevens is faced with questions concerning the very nature of value of the ideals to which he blindly devoted himself for fifty years.  But ultimately, Ishiguro offers an optimistic look at the value of one's endeavors, declaring that regardless of the past, the remains of the day are often its most pleasant part.  Although at times the book is quite sad, Ishiguro is very good at adding comic moments, and overall, I think anyone would enjoy it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Compared to most current pop \\"singers\\" Norah Jones<br />music is like a breath of fresh air. The head bangers<br />and rap lovers are not likely to be interested in or<br />even understand the appeal of her sultry and clean<br />lyrics, and that just great. Unlike most of the pop<br />garbage out there trying to pass itself off as music,<br />Norah's work is based on solid talent and clean,<br />uncluttered music. There is a reason she won five<br />Grammys and the album \\"Come Away with Me\\" another<br />three. Her work is head and shoulders above most<br />everything else on the shelves. Way to go Norah!
B00003CXE7|5.0|The entire film is breath taking. Everything from the scenery, acting, fighting, special effects, are just superb!! I usually don't like long movies. but this one drags you into it. It doesn't seem like 2:45 minutes. It's just a pleasure to watch. Besides the great fight scenes there is a more telling story of a man living/fighting for his family. The viewer actually cares about the characters in the film. The ending was very emotional for me. It was beautiful. This is also a story about the power of love &amp; courage.
0761119752|5.0|My 18 mos old loves this book.  I swear I read this to him at least 10 times a day.  He carries it around with him and loves to look at the pictures.  I have read this book so many times that I dont even need the book to recite the story, I have it memorized.  The book has a pleasant rhyme to it that makes for a great little song.  My son especially loves it when I sing it to him.  He now walks around singing jamma jamma jamma PJ!!! and uses this to let me know it is once again to read pajama time.  I cant praise this book enough, this book has my son loving stories read to him.
B00005ATQD|3.0|Stanley Kubrick's controversial film of sexuality definitely went overboard on the nudity, and on the sexuality. The story really didn't have much to it. Not that it wasn't interesting, it was just a simple plot that ended up having a lot of twists. It fit in with Kubrick's style in many ways. Don't let the previews or advertisements fool you. This is not at all a movie about Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in bed for two hours and forty minutes. There are actually only one or two scenes between them at all. There is an overwhelming amount of nudity and akwardness in Eyes Wide Shut, which definitely makes for an unforgettable movie. I wouldn't promote the film, nor would I recommend it to any of my friends. Not that it was stupid, but it was definitely too much. This is obviously not a kid film. I am rather surprised that it didn't earn an NC-17 rating. Its R rating reflects pervasive sexual content and nudity, language and some drug use. Eyes Wide Shut was a rather uncomfortable film to say the least. Kubrick went overboard.
0375805613|5.0|I look forward to the time that my son really enjoys me reading this book.  This is not one of his favorites nor is it frequently read my house but still this is an excellent book.  I think that my son might be a little too young for this book at the moment but I keep bringing it out and reading it to him hoping that he will finally be into this book.  The Sesame Street books were favorites when I was a kid so I know they will be for my son too.  I recommend that this book be for a child over the age of 2 because at 18 mos this book still has little interest for my son.  For young ones try Sandra Boyton books, mouse paint and Winnie the Pooh Sweet Dreams books.
B00005ASOC|5.0|From the director of the Academy Award winning Good Will Hunting comes an unforgettable film of an unlikely friendship. Finding Forrester introduced Rob Brown, a natural on the big screen, and put him with veteran Sean Connery. The two had great chemistry on screen together and it brought a fun reality to the film. Finding Forrester was fantastic. It was one of the best films of the year, in my opinion. I would recommend this to anyone from 15 years old to 50 years old. It is probably not one for the younger kids though. It has pretty heavy language for a PG-13 film. Aside from the continuous language, the PG-13 rating reflects some sexual references. Other than that though, the supporting cast is excellent, with Oscar winners Anna Paquin and F. Murray Abraham. I recommend that all watch this at least once. You won't regret it.
B000084T18|4.0|I can't deny that 50's a good rapper and is the true definition of \\"gutter\\", but he holds some highly obnoxious qualities.  50 is truly a hater and can't seem to give anybody else in the game credit.  For instance, Ja Rule.  I happen to be a great Ja Rule fan and realize that 50 is ... a good rapper.  50 or \\"Curtis\\" has been talkin' smack about ja and i think that just shows alot of insecurity in him and his career.  Another  thing I don't get is that 50 says ja's an r&b rapper,but 50 ends up using the same r&b flow as Ja.  If you have listened to any albums featuring 50 Cent or G-unit, you'll notice that they keep on talkin' about Ja and Murder Inc.Are they obsessed?  Are they in love with Ja?  I don't know, but the thing I do know is that 50 is makin' a whole lot of paper off of Ja.   50 is gaining incredibile street credibility, and is still hatin'.  People consider Ja a soft rapper screaming MURDA but if he is just a soft r&b rapper, then why are so many rappers jealuos of him.  Just stick to your game and don't worry about anybody else's. <BR>    But enough about 50's ego, let's talk about his new cd.  Get Rich or Die Tryin' is an awesome album and I enjoy many of his songs.  \\"Many Men\\" explains 50's life of violence in an extrodinary way.  The tracks What up Gangsta, In DA Club, Patiently waiting, Heat, High All the Time, 21 Questions, If I Can't, Blood Hound, Poor lil' Rich, and Don't Push Me are monstrous tracks,and if you noticed , that's practically his whole cd.  Even though I'm a Ja fan, there's still room to give 50 Cent credit.  He decribes his way of life vividly and I respect him.  You should go out and cop this album.  I do want to address one thing though, and that is... 50 is a true mc, but I won't consider him top notch untill he puts out an awesome sophmore album.  But then agin, It's MURDA!!!!!!!!!
B000001FN8|5.0|Halla por el 88, muchas cosas cambiaron, y no solo a los Scorpions: grandes grupos del panorama, como Saxon, Judas Priest, Helloween y Kiss entre otros, tornaron su música hacia cambios instrumentales electrónicos, y este acto podia conllevar un suicidio si no se controlaba, este fue el caso de grandes fiascos, como el &quot;Hot in the shade&quot; de Kiss o el &quot;Turbo&quot; de JP.<BR>Scorpions por su parte siguió su linea marcada en &quot;love at first sting&quot;, pero en este caso creando un disco que sobrepasa los límites comerciales.<br />1- Don't stop at the top: primer ejemplo claro de la nueva era, ritmos fáciles de gran calidad que llenan los oidos de buena música, pero algo falta de sentimiento, aun asi en este caso es perdonable.  7/10<br />2- Rhytm of love: gran canción, tema clásico por excelencia del disco, aqui la huella de la majestusidad del grupo perdura en un estribillo acojonante, pero el riff parece algo prefabricado. 8'5/10<br />3- Passion rules the game: recuerda al &quot;loving you sunday morning&quot;, pero con algo más de ritmo y mejor voz de Meine. 7'5/10<br />4- Media overkill: canción de relleno, sosa extremadamente dura y sin concesiones en el análisis musical. 4/10<br />5- Walking on the edge: personalmente, esta es la joya del disco, ritmo emocinante, que inspira tristeza, que va subiendo hasta desembocar en gloria,también cabe destacar las labores de coros, y el solo de la mitad. 10/10<br />6- We let it rock...you let it roll: caso identico al de &quot;Media overkill&quot;. 4/10<br />7- Every minute every day: sublime, canción muy elaborada pulida hasta en el más mínimo detalle, con unos coros memorables, y un rock clásico de base del que ya no se hace. 9'5/10<br />8- Love on the run: leer canciones 6 y 4.  4/10<br />9- Believe in love: como no, en cada disco de Scorpions te puedes encontrar con un baladón, y este es el caso, el sentimiento de esta cancíon ya justifica la adquisición del disco. 10/10
0393317552|5.0|This proved an exciting intellectual journey for a traveller, such as myself, not well versed in anthropology.  Professor Diamond offered me a glimpse of a whole landscape of thought which would have remained otherwise hidden from view.  His original ideas are made all the more vivid thanks to the clarity of his writing and his discerning choice of examples.  He looks at his key concerns from a number of angles, so what might strike some as being repetitious will be seen by those fascinated by his ideas as a welcome thoroughness of approach, like turning a multi-faceted gem to the light.<BR>*<BR>Perhaps it is best to see his argument as starting from the postulate - if you take human groups of sufficiently large number, then the average intelligence (however you might like to define this) will be approximately equal;  given this rough equality of inner potential between groups of humans, how does one explain the diverse fates and developments of human societies throughout the breadth of geography and time?  The structure of his explanation is well summarised in reviews elsewhere.  The fact that his explanation is cogent and convincing, at least shows that it is not necessary to posit innate racial superiority in order to account for human history's vicissitudes.<BR>*<BR>Holding the above in mind, with its attendant thought that the book is, in a sense, addressed to an implicit enemy (those who wish to encourage views of racial superiority), helps to understand the structure of the book.  It also helps to remember the scale and ambition of the argument, otherwise some deficiencies in certain details might seem more damaging than they really are.<BR>*<BR>Professor Diamond clearly has a remarkable mind and it seems a privilege to be able to share some of this thoughts.
B000069AUI|5.0|I loved Parachutes, and I was afraid that this cd wouldn't be as good as it.  The more I listen to it though, the more I love it!  Now I can't decide which cd I like more!
B000069AUI|5.0|At the Grammys, this album won Alt Rock album of the year, which is great because, they're alt rock, but this album beats out all of the nominees for Album of the Year...A stellar track and great lyrics too.  Awesome when performed live.<br />Politik - A rousing opener.  It also puts to rest the description of Coldplay as softies.<br />In My Place - The first single off of this album<br />God Put A Smile... - Catchy acoustic guitar riff, but the catchiness doesn't ruin the track...lyrics are just excellent.<br />The Scientist - Another single and what a great single it is.  This is one of the best tracks from the album.  The piano is so stunning and the lyrics are some of the best they've ever written. <br />Clocks - Their breakout single.  Still another great song.<br />Daylight - Wonderful playing by Jon, Will, and Guy...The guitar riff is kind of psychedelic and it has a great bass line.<br />Green Eyes - Another love song by Coldplay...<br />Warning sign - I love this track.  This song has lyrics that rival \\"The Scientist\\".  The song is just so beautiful.<br />A Whisper - Another heavy song with pounding guitars. <br />A Rush Of Blood To The Head - One of the most emotional songs on the album.  The lyrics about revenge are just captivating.  It starts out with just Chris on the acoustic gutiar but slowly, the band joins him and makes this song one of the best on the album. <br />Amsterdam - Ah, yes...the closing song.  This time it's Chris on the piano for the first couple verses, but then it transforms into the entire band and again more great lyrics.<br />So if you don't have this album, BUY IT!  If you don't have Parachutes, BUY THAT TOO! They won't disappoint.
B0000508U6|5.0|I love Coldplay because their music is so original.  Every song on this cd is amazing.  They are extreamly talented musicians, and they combine great piano, great guitar, and great vocals together!  I never get tired of listening to this cd.  Coldplay has quickly become my all-time favourite group!
B00000634J|4.0|I bought this album about a month ago. I was very fortunate to pick this of all the Lennon compilations that were available. It introduced me to some fantastic songs which, up until now I had not been aware of, being more of a Beatles fan than a Lennon fan. However, the minute I listened to this CD, I had already picked out my favorites:<br />&quot;Jealous Guy&quot;: a somewhat sad, but very beautiful song from Imagine. The piano intro is one of the best I've ever heard.<br />&quot;Cold Turkey&quot;: a Lennon classic. Everything about this song is fantastic. The guitar solos especially are amazing: very loud and aggressive and hypnotizing.<br />&quot;Mind Games&quot;: another ballad-ish Lennon song. I'm not sure what it is about this song which I love so much. Perhaps it's the line &quot;some call it magic, the search for the grail&quot; (which is my favorite line), but perhaps not...<br />&quot;Whatever Gets You Thru The Night&quot;: I LOVE this song. Definitely my favorite on the album. Very creative and fast. It had me dancing the first time I heard it.<br />This album is worth buying if only for those four songs. Other gems include &quot;Imagine,&quot; &quot;Instant Karma!,&quot; &quot;Give Peace A Chance,&quot; and &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over).&quot;
B0000013GT|5.0|In my opinion this is Outkast's greatest album. It's just so chilled out. Also Jazzy Belle has gotta be the greatest Outkast song of all time. Goodie Mobb even makes a few sweet appearances on this album most notablebly on &quot;mainstream&quot;, which is a tight song. if u like outkast then u gotta get this album. u won't be sorry.
B00008RH3L|5.0|\\"Miller's Crossing\\" is a wonderfully unique look by Ethan and Joel Coen at one America's most violent decades, the 1930s.  Although many ambitious gangster pictures like \\"The Godfather\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\" recieve accolades, \\"Miller's Crossing,\\" in its own understated way is just as good.  There are many stand out performances in this film including Gabriel Byrne as 'Tom Reagan,' John Turturro as 'Bernie,' and Albert Finney as the mob king pin 'Leo.'  \\"Miller's Crossing\\" is exemplified by its quirky characters and unique setting seen in more critically acclaimed Coen Brothers works like \\"Fargo\\" and \\"O Brother, Where Art Though?\\"  Perhaps the best the reason to this film is to see the attempted hit on 'Leo' set to the wonderful Irish ballad, \\"Danny Boy,\\" and hear Carter Burwell's eerily beautiful score featuring a standout oboe, waning the moodiness that permeates through this film.  \\"Miller's Crossing\\" is a must see for any Coen Brothers fan or fan of film.  Take note of a younger Steve Buscemi whon like in other Coen Brothers films, does not have a happy end by the credits.
0385484518|5.0|I read this book on a long flight home from a week away.  I missed my family.  I was tired.  It touched me deeply.<br />Told in simple, powerful language, this is a book about what matters.  It is a book about life, written from the perspective of a man coming to the end of his.  It is about a man who advises us to \\"learn how to die in order to learn how to live.\\"<br />Morrie reaches out to his student (writer, Mitch) at a time when Mitch most needs it -- a time when he is questioning his lifestyle and the choices his generation is making.  It is a great book for anyone who struggles with the desire for a simpler life in a complex world.
B00008BLAS|4.0|This was Grand Funk's second album with producer extraordinaire Todd Rungren. He puts some spacey moments in (check out 'Carry Me Through) and lots of echo, but it doesn't detract from what is, with one exception, a very strong set of rock songs.<br />I'd buy this album for the title track alone. Drummer/vocalist Don Brewer proves his singing talents, belting this out like it's the last song he'll ever get to sing. And check out the R&amp;B influence - complete with horns - on Mark Farner's To Get Back In. GFR was always influenced by the Motown sound, though that might have been hard to discern on their earlier efforts.<br />Of course, this was the breaking point for some fans, who simply couldn't stand how much the band had departed from it's loud 'n' proud garage rock roots. And, if you listen to its take on the old pop classic The LocoMotion, I suppose you couldn't blame them. This is a straight throwaway ditty, in my books. (But I still like it better than Farner's Mr. Pretty Boy, a dirge every bit as underwhelming as Mean Mistreater.)<br />One of the best things about this reissue is the inclusion of Destitute &amp; Losin', a stretched out rocker with plenty of power. It showed the band was still capable of flexing plenty of muscle.<br />Oh, if you're wondering about the strange cover art, the original vinyl album had a pair of glasses you could punch out of the cover (thus the two grey stars) and check out the artwork in 3-D.
B00003XB8K|4.0|INCREDIBLE.  Absolutely incredible.  I have been playing this CD over and over and over again.  It's almost perfect.  One or two tracks are forgettable such as Camera Obscura, but the rest can take you away and numb you in a musical bliss you'll never get enough of.   Enigma's first CD, MCMXC a.D., is still the best, but this one is absolutely worth of your collection for anyone remotely interested.
B00008BRB5|5.0|This was one of my favorite Police albums. I bought Synchronicity when it first came out when I was stationed at Chanute AFB, IL: it always brings back fond memories of being in technical training for the Air Force in the early 80's. A must for anyone who enjoys the Police. Tim
B00000F14B|5.0|From the opening scene of this movie to the final march down Main Street, this is a movie musical that translates well from its play origins. Quite often the songs in a musical come across as filler, not traveling well from stage production to a movie. However, each and every song in this movie is not only entertaining, they are used to advance the plot.<br />Our story is about one Professor Harold Hill, who organizes boy's bands in small towns across the Midwest, while using this philanthropic enterprise to put a few dollars into his own pocket. That Professor Harold Hill does not know one note of music doesn't seem to stand in his way. As with all great scam artists, the scam works only for the length of time that the scam artist doesn't care. In this movie, Harold Hill begins to care, which leads ultimately to his undoing.<br />Professor Harold Hill is played by Robert Preston. This role was Robert Preston's definitive career moment, and has set the standard for any would-be Harold Hill of the future. The role of the librarian, the character that ultimately led to Harold Hill's undoing, is played by Shirley Jones, never looking more worldly, pretty and yet innocent than she did in this role.<br />In addition to Robert Preston and Shirley Jones at a peak in their acting careers, this movie boasts a supporting cast that includes Buddy Hackett, Hermione Gingold and Ron Howard. While the well-known cast members tend to overshadow the rest of the cast, the quality of the supporting actors well-matches those of the leads.<br />While the movie is entertaining, it is also an allegory regarding life, particularly life in small towns. Fortunately, the movie does not become overburdened with trying to detail and resolve too many problems. Instead we focus primarily on Marian Paroo (Jones) and Harold Hill. Even Winthrop Paroo's (Ron Howard) lisp is used to support the evolution of Marian's character, as she sees the changes that Harold Hill enacts upon the town.<br />Of course we know that this movie has a happy ending, as most musicals do, but it is the resolution of the problems and a defining moment near the end of the movie that make you realize the movie was deeper than you might have originally expected.<br />Marian is seeking depth and breadth in life, and the small town in Iowa in which she lives, with its shallow, narrow-minded people, have placed her in an intellectual prison. Frustrated, unhappy, she appeals to the younger generation with their open minds to overcome the rut in which their small town appears stuck. Harold Hill sparks a fire in the people of River City that causes the people to look at themselves and the world in a very different way. Marian admires the radical change that Hill is able to cause, and particularly the speed with which he is able to cause it. You suspect that she yearns to be able to create such changes herself. She values the abilities that Harold Hill has, and sees that he can be a force for positive change if properly directed.<br />Harold Hill, on the other hand, is brought to the realization that he has been drifting through life, and that the abilities he has can be used for something other than scamming people. For the first time in his life, Harold Hill cares, and it is his undoing. You also sense that perhaps Hill has been doing this for too long, and the comparison with Marcellus Washburn (Hackett), who has settled into River City and made a home and a life for himself, is such that Harold realizes that he is missing out on a part of life that he never knew he was missing until he met Marian.<br />The final scene of the movie always inspires me. If you want to feel good, reel forward to the picnic in the park and watch the movie from there. When the band plays, badly, for the first time, and you see the pride of the people in the town, at first you want to laugh. But then the band becomes a full marching band with hundreds of members and bright uniforms and shiny instruments. It is atthis moment that you realize that in small towns, and in many bigger towns, the pride of the town in what they have reflects in how they see things like the town band. To outsiders the band may appear to be small, with the skill level less than adequate, but for River City the band is every bit as fine as the Philadelphia Philharmonic.<br />This movie is a bit of nostalgia. Once upon a time, much of the country, especially the Midwest, was as this movie portrays. In many places there are small towns that retain the flavor of River City. People are still people, then as now, and while the times have changed and the names and the faces have changed, the problems of the characters and the awe-inspiring and musical way in which the problems are resolved is still fresh and refreshing. This movie is one of the greatest movies of all time, and is likely to be considered so for many more decades yet; a must-have for anyone looking for quality in their home collection.this moment that you realize that in small towns, and in many bigger towns, the pride of the town in what they have reflects in how they see things like the town band.

0316666343|5.0|The first of Sebold's fiction novels, this book must be one of the most powerful books I've ever read.  Her main character explains watching her family after her rape and murder in such a way that the reader feels they, too, are watching their own family. It's all about the twists and turns of family, love, and letting go. Incredibly vivid, Sebold knows when to uses incredble despcription to entrance you, and when to let reality smudge and blurr. It's heartfelt, genuine emotions had the ability to sweep me away. One of the main lessons of the novel: don't expect all the answers.  So too, do not expect incredible resolutions at the end, but take in the details.  This book is like fine food; definitely indulge in it.  The mystic quality between Earth and Heaven is incredible, and at the end, you will want to own this novel. If you like White Oleander by Janet Fitch, read this.  The Lovely Bones is worth every second you'll spend reading it. Enjoy.
B000002J1F|5.0|Yes was \\"different\\" from the very first.  The orchestrated styling of the group coupled with the unique vocal sound of Jon Anderson created a group that has always been in a class by itself.  While Yes had progressive leanings from the beginning, \\"The Yes Album\\" and \\"Fragile\\" firmly established Yes as the leading progressive rock group, overshadowing The Moody Blues and King Crimson.<br />Rick Wakeman replaced Tony Kaye on keyboards, and brought a symphonic interpretation to rock music that would be even more fully realized on his later solo efforts.  Yes had already been creating detailed and complex music in \\"The Yes Album\\", with three songs near or beyond nine minutes in length, and \\"I've Seen all Good People\\" at nearly seven minutes.  Rick added to the already complex rock music by using synthesizers that focused on an orchestra-like sound.<br />One of the characteristics of Yes' progressive rock has always been the surrealistic lyrics that are often obscure, sometimes nearly or even completely incomprehensible.  Jon Anderson later pointed out that this style may have peaked in \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\", where it was revealed that the words were meant to convey a sound and feeling as much as meaning, and the sounds of the words were chosen more than the meaning; so one is often left trying to seek meaning in the choice of the words when the meaning may be better found musically than lyrically.  Read the title; assume the title tells you everything you need to know about the meaning of the song unless the lyrics are readily apparent.<br />Back in the dark ages of the 70s music from the bass guitar seems to have been better appreciated than it is today, where it seems to have been relegated to establishing a beat and little more.  Listening to \\"The Fish (Shindleria Praematurus)\\" you can see how the bass guitar can lead and set the musical theme for a song.  Chris Squire is one of the best bass guitar players ever, making the bass guitar sing and act as a real musical instrument versus a string equivalent of drums.<br />As with many multi-member groups, the effort of each of the members is highlighted on at least one song.  Steve Howe is prominent in the instrumental \\"Mood for a Day\\", which has excellent acoustic guitar playing that seems more akin to Spanish music than progressive rock, yet it fits so well into this album.  Bill Bruford's somewhat experimental and percussive \\"Five Per Cent for Nothing\\" is too short, and yet it is well-used as the transition from \\"South Side of the Sky\\" to the classic \\"Long Distance Runaround\\".<br />I could spend many pages of discussion about this album because there is so much content within it.  Often maligned by critics that never had the intelligence to understand progressive rock (overblown, pretentious, etc.), \\"Fragile\\" and others of its ilk is a highly experimental musical style that has sometimes emulated classically orchestrated music, but always tries to create something that is off from the mainstream of anything.  From our perspective, this type of music reinterpreted the boundaries of rock music to be anything an artist could conceive and execute.  That the music was readily accessible and enjoyable was an added plus.

B0000640S2|4.0|It's impossible for a real American not to like this movie.When it was released in 1985,it was a huge hit,and with good reason.It finally put the lie to the notion that America was the villan in Vietnam while the Vie Cong and their Soviet allies were the heroes.In this film,the latter are potrayed as sadistic scum,while Rambo,representing American values,is shown as brave,principled,and resourceful.When,at the beginning of this film,Rambo asks \\"Do we get to win this time?\\",he speaks for every American who felt betrayed,whether it was by self-serving goverment bureaucrats(represented by Murdock,Rambo's hateful commanding officer)or left-wing so-called intellectuals who stabbed America's fighting men in the back.The movie rips both types of scum while celebrating the ingenuity and sheer guts of the american fighting man.\\"Rambo Part II\\" may not be added to the list of \\"great\\" war movies,but,in its own way,it helped shape our culture,and change America from a land of Alan Alda/Phil Donahue-type wimps to a self-confident nation that could kick the crap of Saddam Hussein and the Al-Qaida.*** out of ***
0671027344|5.0|This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read.  Although it is very sad and emotional at times, it contains humor that will keep you smiling.  It is a great book about childhood and growing up.  I can relate to many things that Charlie (the main character) goes through.  \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is a book filled with love, passion, romance, humor, and about everything you could ask for.  I highly recommend it.
B000068MKZ|5.0|The calm guitar playing, a bit reminiscent of Joao Gilberto, is the perfect complement to her warm voice, perfectfully in control of its slow movement.
B00005YW4H|1.0|I really wanted to like this CD, but #1 it's not jazz as advertised, and #2, there is a dull sameness to every song.  Extremely disappointing.
0156012197|2.0|This could quite possibly be the least satisfying book that I have ever read... The extended metaphors are too many and too bothersome to analyze as one is reading this short book. I [don't like] having to figure out exactly what the author is saying as I'm reading. It takes away from the flow of the book.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Wow<BR>Opeth is pure talent. I've never heard a band so talented with guitars, drums, and vocals. This band, in my opinion, has their own type of music. One second you can hear screaming vocals with raging guitars, and then in you can hear soft pianos with light vocals and acustics. It just blows me away.<BR> <BR>Now onto the CD:<br />Deliverance is Opeth's latest CD. I bought it at a local best buy yesterday and I love it. As soon as you put it in, you get loud drums and thundering guitars in the opening song 'Wreath'. After that, you hear a song with a hardcore a beginning and a smooth ending, 'Deliverance'. Once those two songs are over, the lightest song (and my favorite) 'A fair judgment' begins to play. The next song 'For absent friends', is the shortest song, mostly because it is just acoustic guitars. Things speed up again as 'Master's apprentices' begins to play followed by the last song 'by the pain i see in others' <br />All in all the CD is wonderful. I suggest you buy this, or another Opeth album if you want something new and if you're seeking REAL talent.
B000006NPY|5.0|On songs like Behold the Night Mare, Once Upon a Time, Crestfallen ... basically the quieter numbers, it seems to me that Billy Corgan arrives at a synthesis (perfect word for a synthesizer-oriented album) of a personal style.  The great heavy, hammering of Smashing Pumpkins days past were fine, but it's these quieter numbers that mean more to me.  There are even moments here that make me think of Lennon's finest cuts.  When Billy tries to do heavier stuff on Adore, without a drummer, the drum machine begins to grate on my nerves.  All in all, Adore stands out from the Pumpkins oeuvre as their, largely successful, reaching attempt at something sublime.  In retrospect, Billy's largely faltered in reacting to the negative public reaction Adore got, by moving away from it.  He should have stayed on the path.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Everyone has heard the term \\"sweet evil\\" used before, correct?<BR>Try to put the term into words and one might find it rather difficult.  Well, 3 minutes into this disc with Keith crunching out the guitar solo in \\"Sympathy\\" all I could think of was \\"sweet evil\\".  The sound here is superb; clean & dirty simultaneously.  Every instrument is heard and all the subtleties of the recording are finally heard the way they were meant to be (in my opinion anyway).  For owners of the previously \\"remastered\\" versions, this one is sonically superior.<BR>Again, you have NEVER! heard Keith's solo like this before and his playing alone is worth the price of this disc.
006092988X|3.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I agree, is an excellent book.  However, it does not have much action.  It seems like the author keeps telling the same thing over and over: Francie Nolan and her family are poor and have to do whatever they can to survive.<br />Throughout about 3/4 of the story, Francie experiences being poor and growing up in Brooklyn, doing whatever she can to live a successful life.  Near the end, she finally starts to become more independent and learn more about the real world.  <br />This story took me a long time to read, probably because the first 3/4 of the book are so slow.  I would reccommend this book, but have patience, because it doesn't get very good until the end.
B0000683WG|5.0|This has always been my favorite T Rex album since I first purchased the vinyl back in the early 70's as a young teen.<BR>Compared to \\"The Electric Warrior\\" which is more straight ahead glam-rock; this album could be considered \\"groovin-glam\\" rock. A few more acoustic guitars are thrown in the mix for a wonderful \\"laid back\\" effect (affect?). <BR>There are great rockers here like \\"Buick Mackane\\" & \\"The Slider\\". <BR>Very few records are timeless and can stand up against the passage or the clock, this is one of them. It is as fresh now as the day I bought the vinyl for my Garard turntable.<BR> If you plan on purchasing this disc and do not have \\"Electic Warrior\\" you MUST purchase both.<BR>Then your all set for hours of enjoyment.
B00007G1ZC|4.0|Although not the flawless masterpiece everyone claims it to be, Kurosawa's Dreams is a strong final statement from the brilliant Japanese director. Although he would continue to make films after Dreams, this is the closest Kurosawa came to creating a masterpiece that rivals his best work. Consisting of 8 segments, Dreams is almost like a series of interconnected short films using variations on a theme.<br />Although the writing and all the performances aren't quite up to Kurosawa's best, they don't diminish the poetic power of this wonderful film. In many respects, the ruminations on man's place in the world, our finite existence and our poor understanding of our surroundings make this Kurosawa's most personal film. Often overlooked by film fans, Dreams is finally getting its due now that it has become available in the superior DVD format. The videotape couldn't do justice to the fine compositions and beautiful use of color. Kurosawa's strength as a director was always his carefully cultivated use of the visual as narrative. What we see and how we organize it visually, makes up the narrative of our lives just as strongly as what we say and do.<br />The support of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg (no matter how you feel about their films and careers)is what allowed Kurosawa to remain vital and creative towards the end of his life. When many in the Japanese film industry had turned their back on this master film director, Lucas and Spielberg (along with Scorsese)allowed him to make a number of minor and major films at the end of his career.<br />Pick up Dreams -- you won't regret visiting Kurosawa's world.
0375701427|5.0|The sixties were crazy. Oh they were! And Philip Roth with his wit and prose takes us to those decade's ugliest side. By that time it was hard to define what was normal, regular. The innocence was about to be lost, and families didn't know what they were about to face. There it comes the Levovs, the family of the protagonist of `American Pastoral'.<br />Known as The Sweede, this guy had it all. His father was the owner of a factory, he was one of the most popular boys in school, he married an ex-miss and had a wonderful smart daughter. A perfect life. Think again. Roth turns the Sweede's world upside down --and our brains also-- when he tells you look closer. So far, Sweede's life has been nothing more than a big mistake after the other, his choices were all wrong, and he never noticed it. But his life is about to fall down in the moment his daughter  bombs a local store and kills a decent man. Now, the story is like a snow ball, that gets bigger and bigger and unstoppable.<br />Roth has a very sophisticated prose which grabs the reader's attention since the very first page. The book rises important issues like, how guilty the parents are when their child becomes a `bad' person, or, if the family prepares the person to the world. I highly recommed this novel for those who are interested in a interesting reading, take will stun you. If you enjoy this book --like I do-- I think you may also enjoy Jonathan Franzen's `The Corrections'.
B00008GKEG|5.0|As expansive in scope as any of the PBS documentaries that have come down the pike, Anthology wasn't just an attempt to tell The Beatles' story--it was an attempt to combine the band's story and two turbulent decades of change in the world. Anthology gives us The Beatles' story in microscopic detail. It also manages to provide a context for the band's music and why it touched (either in a positive or negative sense) a chord with the world.<br />Change is never easy and society occasionally elects gurus to help with that burden. The Beatles were pushed into that role sometimes willingly but just as often not. As a long time fan of the band, I found Anthology engrossing and fun to watch. When I purchased the videotapes I found I didn't return to them very often. This kind of surprised me but I discovered that I didn't have much desire to watch them twice much less three or four times. Perhaps it's the media overkill society we live in. More than likely, it's simply the fact that I appreciate the history but the music means much more to me. What I occasionally will do is dip my foot in one part or another of the Anthology, swim for a couple of laps and then I return to the music refreshed.<br />The inclusion of footage of the \\"Threatles\\" (as critics referred to them as a result of the Free As A Bird and Real Love sessions)jamming makes this collection much more essential than the previous version. It's a chance to see Paul, George and Ringo perform together for the first time since the break up of the band. A note of caution, however, is that these are exactly that--jamming with two yukes and percussion courtesy of Ringo's hands & pants. They aren't finished songs nor were they ever. It's still kind of cool is hear Paul occasionally perform with his acoustic (or electric) on a given tune to illustrate a point.<br />Given Harrison's recent death, there's a sense of closure now that this footage has been released. These are just three guys playing songs they love because they want to not because they're trying to recapture the past. Likewise, the video footage on the making of Free As A Bird and Real Love. Both songs neither hurt nor hinder the Beatles legacy but give long time fans what they've been clamoring for all these years--a reunion of sorts where John, Paul, George and Ringo \\"perform\\" together.<br />The inclusion of the footage from the recording sessions for Real Love and Free are also quite interesting. It provides a glimpse into the altered dynamic of the band. Without Lennon, they weren't quite The Beatles even with his ghostly voice haunting the studio monitors. In many respects, Paul, George and Ringo were paying tribute to a fallen comrad. All of that perspective was lost due to the media saturation and expectations when Anthology came out. Each member of the band had carved out a life and career and still managed to come to terms with a rewarding but difficult past. The bitterness of the divorce was more of a distant memory and the surviving trio was just trying to recapture that feeling of fun they had before they became an industry.<br />Jeff Lynne faced much criticism at the time for his production of the two \\"new\\" Beatles songs. In fact, his sympathetic production ushers the material into the 90's without losing the very qualities that made the band's music so special. While the songs themselves aren't the best Lennon ever wrote (in fact Lennon, McCartney and Harrison wrote much better material during their often uneven solo careers), it's not the quality of the song that matters: what matters is the feeling brought to the performance of the tunes. It's not groundbreaking nor was it meant to be and it shows The Beatles as they really were--a really good band that made it very very big (to paraphrase John).The insights into the making of the Free video are particularly interesting. Director Joe Pykta discusses the origin of the concept, various additions, subtractions made to the video. It's a loving valentine to the band with witty references to oodles of Beatles songs.<br />The impact of the band on popular music is put into perspective by Ringo when he commented that there were lots of big acts and very few monster acts (to paraphrase him). They were the monsters of rock music at a time when there was a lot of popularity for a lot of bands. It all came down to their level of success and their cultural impact as a result.<br />The sound quality is terrific and although the remix to 5.1 will continue to generate debate amongst Beatles fans. Tampering with the past is touchy business much less a fan's memory of \\"how it was\\". Luckily, The Beatles themselves recognized that they were some mythical Holy Grail nor are they some sort of ancient artifact. The remix breathes new life into the older material allowing a new generation to appreciate how groundbreaking much of what the band accomplished really was.<br />While there's a lot of essential material here, the Anthology really could have been edited down to a two or even three disc set. There is considerable repetition. That was necessarily, no doubt, because each member had not only their own recollections to share but their own agenda about the past as well.<br />Nevertheless, the wealth of material is worthwhile having for hardcore Beatles fans and rock historians. Is it essential? Well that all depends on how important the era was to you and whether you feel the need to relive it again. As I said sometimes a short dip in the pool of memory refreshes both the soul and makes us appreciate the importance of what is past.<br />The DVD is less awkward than the videos and more user friendly than both the laserdisc & videotape formats. The importance of the Anthology for fans goes beyond the music or any need to recapture the past. It's comfort video for the soul. Anthology manages to digest an important era in history with a fair perspective. The Beatles themselves recognized they weren't the pied-pipers of the era. They were just for guys making music they thought was important and trying to live down a reputation that was hoisted upon them by the media and a adoring world. Anthology is like an old coat you keep around because it's smells and touch bring life to distant memories.<br />Now for the nasty stuff--criticism. The picture verges from fair to excellent. The earlier interviews of Paul, George & Ringo look like they were shot without either adequate lighting or on early digital video. The quality doesn't hold up to some of the other footage. The inclusion of the band's promotional videos and performances are great--but it would have been nice to have an option to play them without commentary or as supplements on the 5th disc. No doubt, Capitol plans on re-releasing the Red and Blue albums on DVD with the assorted collection of promo videos included (and there were quite a few).<br />Anthology is a link to the past not buried by the past.

B00008BXJF|5.0|Well, it seems that King Crimson has done it.  They've released an album that not only sounds good, but really explores new ground.  The percussive PTB II is perhaps the most interesting on the album.  Dangerous Curves is unlike anything that i've heard.  The distorted vocals on the title tracks and throughout the album are appropriate and cool, to say the least.    Two vocal tracks really shine on this album - Eyes Wide Open, and Facts of Life.  Eyes Wide Open takes a well-deserved break from the heaviness of the surrounding tracks, and is unforgetable to say the least.  Facts of Life is an incredible song with music that's as biting and jumpy as the lyrics.  Appropriately harsh, yet somehow very classy.    While \\"Happy With What You Have to be Happy With\\" is a decent song with a powerful message, I don't like it as much as the other longer and more powerful vocal tracks.    While I noticed those four incredible standout tracks, the rest of the album deserves equal attention.  Really, you can't go wrong with this album as long as you have an open mind towards music.      My only problem is that there could have been one more song (4 or 5 minutes long) similar in structure to the three present.  I didn't quite feel a balance in that respect. Otherwise, perfect.

B00006JJ1O|1.0|this review is more of a response to the other reviews i've read on this same cd.<br />first off, t.a.t.u. didn't make this music, it was made for them by a man named trevor horn.  they are NOT saying anything special.<br />for everyone who liked this album, can't you just see that these girls are just the result of a slick marketing campaign?  they are not about empowerment for women, as the only reason their lesbianism is highlighted is because their record company knows it will help them sell albums.  <br />finally, for all of you who think of &quot;how soon is now&quot; as the opening song for the show charmed, please be aware that it is a very good song by a very good band called the smiths.  the fact that t.a.t.u. would have the nerve to cover this song is actually kind of humorous... listen to the original and then listen to their version and savor the irony:  they've accidentally taken a song about despair and self-doubt, and while trying to build upon this, turned it into a peppy teenage anthem.  actually, it's not that funny.  ugh.<br />please don't buy this album.
B00004ZEQX|4.0|For starters I genuinely enjoy Fulci's films and am a fan of senseless gore movies, so if your an average horror fan you should maybe deduct one star of my rating.<br />Anyhow, I've seen most of Fulci's film's, The Beyond being my favourite and the Anchorbay DVD of Beyond rocks, but House by the cemetary was one that I had not seen. I decided to buy the film as it was offten ranked as his third greatest (#1 Beyond, #2 Zombi but I like City of the Living Dead a little better than House as third) and also as it starred the super cute Fulci regular Catriona (Katherine) MacColl. I got the Diamond DVD as it was afordable and another guy in his review here said that he had being informed that although the Daimond version was rated 'R', it was actually the uncut version. And although a VERY graphic throat slashing scene remained intact and the rest of the film seemed uncut, I later read somewhere that a version 3 minutes longer was soon to be released. Whether or not the Diamond DVD here is the uncut version I cannot say.<br />House by the Cemetary basicly centres on a family moving into a house inhabited by a evil doctor who uses his victims fresh body parts to stay alive. It is filmed in typical Fulci style that critics consider full of continuety errors, while fans feel that this makes the films dream/nightmare like. I am fairly in between, I always believed that Fulcis camera technique is certainly artistic but he obviously can't tell a straight story and while this works brilliantly in the Beyond, it just makes some of his work very boring to sit through like Zombi. House had a genuinely eerie ambiance and Fulci does create a creepy atmosphere successfully but not to the extent of his master piece the Beyond.<br />Being Fulci, there is some great gore in this film. Theres a great throat slashing scene (mentioned above) which is an excellent effect and a knife in the back of the head scene, but there is also a very weak bat attack scene, the bat ten times more phoney than the fake spiders in the Beyond. There was not as much of Fulci's trademark gore in House as some of his other flicks, but once again the Diamond version is 84 minutes and I read somewhere that the uncut running time is 87 minutes, but this is the only version I've seen so I cannont coment.<br />If your a fulci fan then you will really enjoy this film but if you are new to his work then maybe check out the Beyond first or rent House before you buy.
B00004T9UF|4.0|...the CD is great.  Eminem pushes the envelope (like he always does) even further than his debut release.  People keep yapping about his lyrics and him hiding behind all this psychological nonsense.  The truth is that there are many people that do understand his sense of humor .....  He just has the brass ones to put it on an album and let everyone here the jokes.  Do not let any of these naysayers ward you off.  This is one of the best rap CDs that you can find.  It seems rare anymore to find a cd that you can play from start to finish and not have to hit the skip button.  ...this is a cd worth having.
B000063147|5.0|This album is absoultly fatastic, never lossing sight of the hardcore\metal music.
0316666343|4.0|I read the book in a matter of a few days. I had heard many things about the book being both good and bad. I decided to try the book for myself. Although, there are a few parts where the book is slow moving and even disturbing I found the book to be very interesting. It is a book that you dont really get into, or even uderstand, till it is over. You really begin to understand Suzie, the main character, by the end. It brings a new light to an explination of life after death. Althogether, I found it to be well written and interesting but I do believe it is aimed more towards a teenage audience.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Where do i start,<br />This is probably the best war document/movie ever made in my opinion.<BR>It will be shown to my kids, and i hope to there kids for years to come as a tribute to these fine Men who were all heroes.<br />The interviews before the start of the disk were tear jerking in there own truth of the facts that were put on film by the real stars of this bad time in our history.<br />They were real Men going into the war without any questions as to why, they understood a job needed to be done and they did it.<BR>End of story and proven History.<br />I will continue to show this master to all my Family from an early age as it is also a History lesson they need to learn regarding the horror of war.

B000084T18|5.0|50 cents latest album isn't good, it's an instant classic.  Give Dr. Dre and Eminem thier due on the album, however, 50 cent deserves a lot more of the credit on the album then he has been recieving.  His lyrics are raw, and he didn't change the style of his previous albums to sell records, he just got better production.  Don't listen to the bitter reviews of Mattdemoss (Royce da 5'9 - are you kidding me?), Optimus Prime, and Jonathan Clark, among others.  They say they like rap, but the only rap they like is the kind that nobody wants to listen to.  As soon as a new CD gets popular, haters want to knock it down because their little rappers can't get a deal with a real label.  With rap as popular as it is right now, it seems like everyone is making a \\"bubble-gum\\" rap single to promote their weak albums.  However, 50 doesn't sell out like a lot of other rappers have.  50 does what he does best by rhyming about the streets, haters, and he even throws in a couple a tracks for the ladies without selling out.   Decide for yourself, but after one listen to \\"Get Rich of Die Tryin,\\" you're gonna want to go out and get his old albums.  He's been patiently waiting to blow, ladies and gentleman, welcome to the 50 cent show.
B000021XS0|5.0|the best DT production since their beginning!all the tracks are excellent!petrucci, portnoy, myung and rudess are all on fire! labrie gives his best self and the outcome is excellent! my best tracks: beyond this life, the dance of eternity, the spirit carries on.

This is definitly the best cd you will ever listen to in your lifetime.

6302968100|5.0|The roller coaster scene sums up this whole movie.  It serves as a metaphor to an emotional roller coaster of the mind, body and soul.  \\"True Romance\\" is a tough, graphic look at ...love and how everyone gets one shot at love and what happens if you blow it.  That's putting it in simple lamemans terms but it's the foundation to this brilliant film.  There was something magical going on when they made this movie, and no other film has ever come close to topping this one.  This film is everything.<br />  \\"You look ridiculous!\\"........Patricia Arquette, True Romance.
B000002KLZ|5.0|A perspective moment:<br />My favourite Fleetwood Mac album is Tusk  - most people would say Rumours - I state this as a glimpse into my feelings about the Big Mac.<br />Fleetwood Mac Live is ostensibly a live snapshot of the tour that FM underrtook after the release of their &quot;experimental album&quot; Tusk. It continues, today, to survive as the most emotional document of their live performances.<br />Every member of the band performs exceptionally on this album, but to gauge an example of the studio FM VS the live FM one needs to look only to Stevie's work on this album:<br />I'll start with Dreams, which is an outstanding renditon of the song. Sara is the version you always wanted, but couldn't get on the CD version of Tusk, perhaps Stevie's best and most personal song it is filled with emotion, and contains the lyrics cut from the CD version of the album. <br />Landslide deserves its own paragraph as it is one of the main reasons to purchase this cd set. Some have complained that Stevie's voice lacks volume on this track. My opinion: there are no volume problems with Stevie's voice on this track - this is simply the most emotional version of this song that Stevie ever performed. At times her voice becomes a whisper, which only adds to the impact of this song, Stunning. Buy this abum for this song if for no other reason.<br />Other reasons to buy the album:<br />Lindsey's versions of I'm so Afraid, Oh Well, and Never Going Back Again. Fireflies, an outstanding unreleased Stevie track, and a stunning version of Rhiannon.<br />Last but not least, a stunning example of the magic that Lindsey, Stevie, and Christine could create when blending their voices together - The Farmer's Daughter. The vocals on this track are sonic porn - just breathtaking. The only thing that comes close is Bleed to Love Her from The Dance.<br />There was something magical that happened when those three sang together. Something that will never be dupicated, and this album is a fine example of<BR>that magic.
B000002U9E|5.0|Hounds Of Love is one of the best albums of the 80s. Kate is experimental yet traditional, sincere yet playful, warm yet austere, attractive, original, empathetic, romantic, imaginative, and wide-eyed yet worldly. <br />Kate is a child of the post-war tradition, an English Rose born in Kent, the garden of England, absorbing her formative interpretations of the world into her own imaginative landscape and you try to place the moments into a particular place. The opening line of Cloudbusting ?I still dream of Orgenon? has the mind racing about exotic worlds as much as Rutger Hauer?s closing speech in Bladerunner about C-Beams off the Tanhauer Gate. <br />On ?Running Up That Hill?, where Kate may have imagined the rolling hills of the countryside, I saw the suburbs, popularised as a strange place between town and country, the sublime and the mundane.<br />The cover is set like it is from a photo album, set in a white surround. Purple swirls around her and in the colour of her dress with scatterings of white like the entrails of the cosmos. Kate?s obvious fascination with mysticism is evident and her hair is tousled outwards as she casts a bewitching, supremely confident gaze at the camera, her face beautifully made-up and arms wrapped around two dogs, who are not (or are no longer) the fierce hounds that threaten to engulf her in the title song but loving and puppy-like. <br />The inside sleeves are a mixture of the contemporary and the romantic, showing her as an archer, an Ophelia-type surrounded by red flowers in a lake, her arm outstretched for help yet a look in her eyes seems to want her rescuer to come in.<br />I won't concentrate on all the songs because, even in a great album such as this, I prefer some to others.<br />A Deal with God was re-titled when Kate was told that the originally intended name might offend (nearly 20 years after The Beach Boys? ?God Only Knows?) Running Up That Hill is breathtakingly sensuous and haunting, the background notes similar to the mimicked hounds in the title song. Best moment: 'Let me steal this moment from you now. Come on angel, c'mon c'mon darling. Let's exhange the experience oh.'<br />Hounds of Love begins with the spoken exclamation ?It?s in the trees, it?s coming?, which seems to either mimic old horror movies (themselves famous as being allegories for hidden fears or desires) or was taken from one. It's almost like a punk or psychedelic song in structure, breathlessly marching to a regular beat and seeming to starting where it finished in a glorious loop. Best moment: 'Take my shoes off and ttthrrroowww them in the lake And I'll be...'<br />The first part of the album, in general, storms ahead under drums with the rhythm of a steam locomotive so it is apt that it ends with the whistle of train pulling into station. <BR> <BR>The second part ?The Ninth Wave? is supposed to be about the saving of a drowning woman but it doesn?t seem to follow a straight story. Firstly she is in the water on the piano-led ?And Dream of Sheep?, with the sound of seagulls reminding us of the mechanical birds (the helicopters) of ?The Big Sky?, the ?white horses? waves.<br />Then she is skating on ice, which collapses beneath her on the haunting ?Under Ice?, whose sound is reminiscent of Cloudbusting.<BR>Best Moment: 'There's something m-o-v-i-n-g under'<br />'Waking The Witch? (Best moment: 'Help this blackbird, there's a stone around my leg') takes us into something like a medieval witch trial and her presumed drowning, for she is a ghost on the next song, the sublime 'Watching Me Watching You'.<br />But even when we think she is the ghost she says 'There's a ghost in our home' (according to the lyric notes- I hear the more haunting 'There's a ghost in our hall') And this would also pre-empt the exquisite 'The Sensual World's concentration on intimate relationships ('You can't hear what I'm saying') The simple tick tock motion of the song is laid over with quirky twists in notes, the sound of the tide and, one of the best moments on the album, Kate repeating what sounds like 'Release sea' But since we hear what we want to hear I imagine 'Release me'. And parts of the song are cut up like on 'Waking the Witch'.<br />The remastered version includes 4 other songs that would have been stand-outs on any album. I particularly like ?Be Kind To My Mistakes? and ?Under The Ivy.? <br />Lastly, if you like ?Hounds Of Love? you also need to buy Tori Amos?s ?Little Earthquakes?.
B00007AJGH|5.0|One of the great joys of movie-going is to see a concept, that on-the-face-of-it is so goofy and off-beat that it should never work, but, in the end, does work and works in spades!  So it was for me with Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  This Vista Series DVD brings the film to us with a crisp & clean picture, THX sound, and a beautifully packaged set of extras that include a very clever interactive menu, plus loads of goodies presented smartly, with humor and surprises.<br />Seeing the film again reminded me how impressed I was with the audacity and accomplishment of Bob Zemeckis and his collaborators on bringing off with care and intelligence, a sharp & funny film that plays to both children & adults. Who would have thunk it?<br />Taking a Chinatown-like story of early Los Angeles with some basis in fact (destroying the Red Line to make way for freeways) complete with murder & intrigue & marrying it to the screwy conceit that cartoon figures, aka Toons, actually lived and worked as live actors and inhabited a section of LA called Toontown is such a manifestly dopey idea that it would take enormous inspiration, intelligence and attention to detail to make it even nominally work.  All of those qualities were present, as the extras demonstrate, in abundance here, and the result was movie magic.<br />Made prior to CGI coming into its own, the characters were brought to the screen brilliantly.  As one of the animators pointed out, even early CGI was rejected because the film-makers wanted the characters to maintain their cartoon look, only brought into  3 dimensions.  The hows and whys of what they did to achieve this magic are worth a look.<br />Anchored by the great casting of Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and Joanna Cassidy and Charles Fleischer, brilliant technical work, and a clever story strung through with great good humor, dialogue and jokes for kids and adults, this film has some cherished, favorite lines, from Baby Herman's \\"That's my problem, I've got a 50 year-oldlust, and a 3 year-old dinky.\\", to  Jessica Rabbit's: \\"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.\\", to Eddie on the wayward bullets \\"Eh, Dum Dums!\\"  This is great stuff.<br />\\"Toons, gets em every time!\\"  Some kind of classic here, and well worth your while.
0790729687|4.0|I've never been obsessed, or even mildly fascinated, by the concept of vampires. While I'm still not, the film adaptation of Anne Rice's novel INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE does provide an evening's worth of above average entertainment.<br />It's a tough job being a vampire, but in Rice's lurid world somebody has to do it. The film opens in modern day San Francisco where bloodsucker Louis (Brad Pitt) gives an interview to a journalist (Christian Slater). For the record (and for the audience in an extended flashback), Louis begins his story in 1790s New Orleans where he was a plantation owner, who crosses paths with the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise). Lestat is looking for a bud to hang out with, and seduces Louis with immortality's allure. Louis has nothing better to do with his idle life, and so allows himself to be transformed into one of the Undead. After a period of knocking around together, the boys decide that their N'Awlins flat needs, I guess, the feminine touch. So, Louis stumbles upon (and bites the neck of) a 12 year-old plague-orphan, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst). The girl is so fetching that our heroes decide to keep her around, and Lestat subsequently transforms her into an addition to their mini-coven. The trio are thick as thieves for years until bad things start to happen.<br />I can't really award more than 4 stars because, for me, other vampire films have been more impressive. SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE (2001) was more cleverly done by far. And DRACULA (1979), starring Frank Langella, while not considered a great film, had scenes of cinematic artistry not matched here. Indeed, much of the power of INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE comes from visuals perhaps composed for their shock value.<br />The plot of this film is largely the commendable revelation that vampires' lives are lonely, wretched affairs. An eternity of sleeping in coffins, avoiding sunlight without some serious sunblock, and biting the jugulars of nubile, scantily-clad maidens isn't really a glamorous lifestyle. However, it's great fun watching one of this era's greatest Silver Screen hunks, Tom Cruise, be so amorally menacing in a charming sort of way. Dunst is captivating as the willful Claudia, who never physically matures beyond her young age, but whose inner self hardens as we watch. Squinting at Claudia's curls through half-closed eyes, I could almost see Shirley Temple. But America's Princess never wielded a knife like this! Pitt's Louis is so burdened with guilt over his misguided career move that he's a constant wet blanket. By the film's final scene, which is the essence of Lestat, it's apparent he too wishes Louis would just get over it.estyle.

B00008GKEG|5.0|This is the pinnacle of all DVD releases! Of all the fantastic movies and various live performances which have been remastered to DVD, this is the ultimate! The Beatles revolutionized our pop culture unlike any other influence, and to have their story told on VHS tape didn't do it justice. There is not one bad song in their catalog, and bands are still trying to make \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" to this day with no avail. I am really excited that they have finally released this monumental collection on DVD. The Beatles can do no wrong. Everything they release shoots straight to number one, and it's been 33 years since the four of them were last in studio together. Look for this collection to sell as hot if not hotter than the original VHS and subsequent CD releases in 1995-1996. Just look at their \\"One\\" album from 2 years ago. It's just a recompiled collection of their #1 chart toppers and it knocked 'NSync off the charts when it was released! The Beatles broke up 10 years before most 'NSync fans were even born. That's a testamant to the power of their music, and the scope of their influence. \\"Anthology\\" is recomended to ANY music fan, and if you are a Beatle fan I don't think you could be any happier.<br />A great addition to \\"Anthology\\" is the bonus disc, which contains a very relaxed informal interview with Paul, George, and Ringo in 1995.  Also, they take you back to Abbey Road studios one more time in 1995 to discuss how they made \\"Golden Slumbers\\", \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", and their most phillisophical song \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\".  For all you musicians and producers, this is really fantastic.  They break down the tracks so you hear each overdub and brilliant idea before the master edit.  They get in to all the technical aspects.  You can watch it 100 times and never get board!
6302054982|5.0|Great movie,but I loved the music of 'Layla'(Derek and the Dominos also a.k.a, Eric Clapton[pink Cadillac scene]). First 2 minutes is hard rock music,later followed by 2 minutes of piano,in this movie they edit 'Layla' to only the piano part,and another good song is 'What is life' by (George Harrison),two great and awesome songs!
B000089CPF|5.0|Calexico have always been restless experimenters, juxtaposers and journeymen, crafting a unique fusion of bluesy Mariachi, desert-rock and jazz, and injecting healthy doses of experimentation into the otherwise straightforward records on which they've made guest appearances. Yet, for their innovation and distinctive sound, their albums have always had their weak spots-- moments in which their ideas seemed to be running away with the band's ability to execute them. That time has passed. All of Calexico's previous strengths come home to roost on Feast of Wire, the band pushing their experiments further than ever before and pulling each of them off unfalteringly. In short, Calexico have created their first genuinely masterful full-length, crammed with immediate songcraft, shifting moods and open-ended exploration.<br />A brief acoustic guitar figure and pounding waltz beat open things at a crisp gait. Joey Burns quickly intones with the lines, \\"Washed my face in the rivers of empire/ Made my bed with a cardboard crate,\\" immediately establishing the tension of the borderline that pulls Calexico's music in its many directions. Burns is suddenly a singer-- he's always made do with what he had, but the limitations that were once so apparent have developed into a strong and confident tenor, assertive and emotive. The music behind him feels bolder and more courageous, too, as the veil of obscurity that guarded so much of their previous releases has vanished. The detail of this album is utterly stunning, as melodies rise against countermelodies, subtle electronic processing seals guitars in amber, and instruments blend in fascinating and unpredictable ways.<br />The band keeps things tight and concise across sixteen tracks, and John Convertino's drums corral the rush of sound into all the right spaces, pushing the steel guitar motifs that color the background of \\"Quattro (World Drifts In)\\" up to meet Burns' vocals and beating back the bombastic strings that cascade over \\"Black Heart\\" like a desert thunderstorm. \\"Not Even Stevie Nicks\\" is pristine pop that makes me wish Burns would find more occasions to use his falsetto. It also makes me wish he'd print his lyrics, even if lines like, \\"With a head like a vulture and a heart full of hornets/ He drives off the cliff into the blue,\\" convey such a rush of emotions that they virtually fill in the blanks by themselves.<br />He's still full of border stories, too, with narratives like \\"Across the Wire\\" packing up tales of dodging the border patrol and leaving everything you know for the abstraction of hope. \\"Woven Birds\\" is a hushed reverie for an abandoned mission that even the swallows have left to the ghosts, building to spine-tingling moments where the vocals, Melodica and vibes all meet on the same note and coalesce into a single sound. The piano and strings of \\"The Book and the Canal\\" serve as a moody pivot into the album's mostly instrumental second half, though the darkness of that piece is largely swept aside by \\"Attack El Robot! Attack!\\", which mashes Pharaoh Sanders, Portuguese guitar and German IDM into a beautiful stew of sci-fi strangeness.<br />\\"Dub Latina\\" and \\"Crumble\\" show Calexico burrowing deeper into jazz than ever before, with the latter featuring fluid guitar, trombone and trumpet solos squaring off against each other over a white-hot groove. \\"Güero Canelo\\" is a curious flamenco strut built around what sounds like a distorted Speak-n-Spell sample and sliding sound effects, while \\"Whipping the Horse's Eyes\\" and the closer, \\"No Doze\\", each examine big skies and desert stillness-- one with steel guitar and bowed bass, the other with bowed vibes, nylon strings, static, percussion and steel. Burns is back to a whisper on the closer, but here it strikes as though he's trying not to wake someone sleeping in the room rather than shielding the listener from his limitations.<br />Calexico have always threatened to make a spectacular record, and even came close on 1998's The BlackLight, but having spent the last three years honing their skills has paid off for them in ways no one could have predicted. Feast of Wire calls on a stunning, finely kept arsenal of genres, textures and images to transport you to the Southwest's forgotten places and put you in the shoes of the people who stare across the border in both directions. It is the album we always knew they had in them but feared they would never make.<br />-Joe Tangari, February 24th, 2003
0783117388|2.0|...Why do I watch it?  Because there's enough fun, fact, and female reality check to hook me.  I have a shoe addiction, too, but I'm still trying to figure out how someone who writes a column for a newspaper can afford designer shoes, fabulous outfits, and salon hair and still pay rent in Manhattan.  Those are just a few of the fairy tales of the show.  A post-feminist, post-modern fairy tale is exactly what SATC is.<br />...If these women honestly want a man to have a real relationship with, why do they find glaring defects in the available men they meet?  Either he's too young...or he doesn't make enough money or he doesn't like the right china pattern...it's Seinfeld!  A more upscale, glittery crew than Seinfeld, but it's the same emotionally unavailable, incapable of having a relationship crew as the one on Seinfeld.  The women on SATC complain about modelizers, womanizers, and every other variety of -izers, but they're just as obsessed with ideas of male perfection.  It doesn't matter if the guy is sweet, kind, genuine, or otherwise acceptable.  If they can find one thing wrong with him, he gets discarded.  They're as shallow as the men they complain about.<br />What are the chances that 4 women in NYC have their level of education and income, but not one of them is involved in a personal growth program?  How is it that no one is in therapy or a 12-step program?  God knows they need it-Carrie drinks like a fish and Samantha is a total sex addict.  Even if 12-step is pass&eacute;, therapy is de rigueur for Manhattanites.  Not one of these chicks even reads self-help books.<br />I'd like to see the post-September 11th season of the show.  I can only hope that a huge event like that would inject some depth (and values) into the lives of The Fad Four.
B00005KHJT|5.0|This is the horror movie that all others should be judged by.  So believable it's scarry.  Michael Myers is what jason and freddy kruger are not, realistic.  And that makes this a movie you shouldn't watch alone on a dark and stormy night.  What makes this version (dvd) awesome is the added footage that was [filmed] for the tv version.  It's incorporated right into the story flawlessly and helps give so more background into the story.  I love all of John Carpenters films, but this is in the top three of all he did.  A classic.  A must see.  Just lock your doors and windows first!
B00006RU5B|5.0|While it can be said that not all the talents of the wonderful band members are used to their full potential, this is still a kicking album. I'll admit, many of the songs follow the same formula and rhythm, most have their positive sides. So what I'll do (because I always find these the most helpful) is give my opinion of each of the tracks.<br />Cochise-Album opens with a pretty catchy heavy tune. I like the guitar riff in this one and the little guitar interlude. (8/10)<br />Show Me How To Live - Wow, this is definitely a headbanging song. As for heavy songs I'd say this is one of the better ones on the album (10/10)<br />Gasoline - Another great heavy song, and the way Cornell says gasoline is wicked. And we get our firs taste of Morello and his wah wah. (10/10)<br />What you Are - This was the first audioslave song that jumped out at me before buying it. If you can get through the chorus without having to tap your feet or nod your head or anything, you have my respect(10/10)<br />Like A Stone - Beautiful. Everything about this song is great.  This is where the album takes a better turn !(10/10)<br />Set it Off - As some have said it does sound Rage, and while it's not a bad thing, it's definitely a change after Like a Stone. Intro is great, but it just seems to be too much of a transition between tracks 6 and 8. (9/10)<br />Shadow on the Sun - Arguably the best track on the album. It's definitely up there with 2 and 5. The solo is toooo short. (10/10)<br />I am the Highway - Yes, another ballad! What a beautiful song to just lay back to. This album has it all (10/10)<br />Exploder - Ack, and now we enter the rest of the album, which, unfortunately, isn't as praiseworthy as the first. This one feels too much like set it off, only without as much punch. The instruments are all good and present here and Cornell does some wacky thing toward the end but it just seems weak to me. (6/10)<br />Hypnotize - While the guitar solo and bass in this song are 10's the song isjust lacking the power of the earlier tracks. I do prefer it to Exploder though. (7/10)<br />Bring Em Back Alive - I keep thinking he's gonna say &quot;I am a viking&quot;. I don't know why I don't like this song, something just doesn't work. There are much better tracks than this one. I just wish Morello's solos would find their way into the better tracks.(5/10)<br />Light My Way - Now this follows the same formula as the last ones, but for some reason this one works. This one definitely rocks out. Maybe it's Cornell's voice, I can't put my finger on it. (9.5/10)<br />Getaway Car - And yet more ballads. This one is another mellowish softie. What a transition. It's beautiful. (10/10)<br />The Last Remaining Light - A great way to close. Nice guitar, nice lyrics, excellent. (10/10)<br />Some people have said that this band is capable of much more. While I'm sure that's true (they are very talented) I'd have to say this album is amazing, regardless. You can't deny what they have put together. You have to look at what it is, not what it isn't. It's not rage. It's not soundgarden. <br />It's audioslave.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This movie is what sci-fi is all about.  By far the best sci-fi movie of the 80's if not the best ever.  Special effects rocked, the story was awesome, and ARNOLD!  I only wish they went into more detail with the future scenes.  Oh well, maybe in terminator four right?  Anyway, the dvd is packed with great features for the hardcore fan.  A must see and a must own.
B000022TSH|5.0|Chinatown is a must see because it renewed interest in the film noir genre, and because it provides reference for a number of other movies that followed it. In 1974 this classy, elegantly filmed movie with the evocative soundtrack really stood out. It also stands as Jack Nicholson's finest work. The movie manages to stay just this side of caricature. Scenes recalled out of context (\\"Hey kitty...\\" and \\"My sister..my daughter\\") can conjure up a laugh, but when viewed in sequence with the rest of the movie they are simply horrifying.<br />Jack Nicholson was born to play the satyr with a scorched soul, JJ Gittes. His leering smile and the way he flicks his cigarette tell you all you need to know about how JJ Gittes wants to be perceived. Just how damaged he is gets revealed during the course of the story. Faye Dunaway almost overplays the Evelyn Mulwray character but once again, it is appropriate for the character once you have seen the whole movie and know what happened to her.<br />Interestingly, JJ Gittes goes through the whole movie on various wrong tracks. The penny doesn't drop until Evelyn Mulwray off-handedly states that \\"Hollis didn't wear bi-focals\\". John Huston's congenial evil is chillingly revealed by this simple statement.<br />Finally, pay special attention to the sister/daughter scene. When what happened is revealed to Jake, does Evelyn admit to complicity? Opinions in this household vary. The movie is not significantly changed by either interpretation, but the character shadings could shift in your mind.<br />The movie needs to be seen a couple of times for the complicated plot to sink it. Buy it!
B0000541AM|5.0|I love this movie.  It has one of the most unique and entertaining plot lines ever.  Gangs run rampant in the night of New York City.  One group, the warriors, must get back to there home territory.  But to do so they must go through nearly every other gang in the city.  Follow along on the journey, and whatever you do, don't stop running!
B00005JL96|5.0|I love the look and the gentle feel of this movie. My 3 year old identifies with Stitch, who is bad, but who becomes good. My ten year old enjoys the nuances of the script, and we all really enjoy the music. An excellent addition to anyone's movie library
B00006F7IM|5.0|The best and most entertaining baseball movie ever, hands down.  The sequal was also great.  As for the third, well, if you liked the first two you may enjoy it.  It wasn't so bad, just a different story.  Anyway, back to the one that started it all.  An all star cast headlines this comedy as the rag team team of the century go from chumps to (almost) champs.  Follow along for the exploits of baseballs craziest set of characters.  Major league is a must see for any baseball fan.
B000006OS2|2.0|McClintock! is an excellent John Wayne Western, lots of laughs, and of course nothing beats the chemistry that John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara bring to the screen.  Sadly however, the quality of this DVD is extremely poor, making it difficult to enjoy.  A VHS copy of a TV airing of McClintock! would be better than what you get on this DVD!  Lots of scratchy sections, poor focus, and audio volume keeps dropping out.
6304698798|5.0|The entire trilogy was awesome, but the final of the series is the best.  Clint Eastwood returns as &quot;the man with no name&quot;.  Throw in Eli Wallach as &quot;Tuco&quot; and Lee Van Cleef as &quot; Angel eyes&quot; and you have one hell of a matchup.  The story is a little slow moving at first, but you get hooked.  It somewhat follows the previous movies.  But the character interaction is the best of the three.  The shootouts and unintentional humor make this a classic and must see for fans of the western movie genre.  You can't go wrong with this masterpiece!
B00008AY3L|4.0|Since purchasing Live From Mars (2001), I have been an extremely devoted Ben Harper fan.  I have enough emotional to so many of his songs, that I am bordering on fanatical.  That said, it is hard for me to give his new effort, DOTI, five stars, only because I have a biased opion and I think Ben could release 72 minutes of him barking Jingle Bells and I would eat it up.  Also, I am insanely in love with my girlfriend Emilie Henry, and we are both huge fans.  <BR> However, four stars is easy to give because DOTI is that good.  I feel that Ben will soon put forth an effort that will force me to give five stars (so far, only live from mars, the white album, and dave and tim: live at luther college has gotten all five).  Yes there are weak spots in DOTI, but nothing worth skipping over.  Bring the Funk, although the rhymes make me think Ben didnt put too much thought in to them, still gets me going.  You see, Ben plays all styles of music, thus avoiding a stereotype, and I feel Bring the Funk was a fun stray into the funk scene, where the groove and beat are highlighted over the lyrics.  <BR>   A review above stated that \\"With My Own Two Hands\\" was no good.  I hope that it was typo and no other Ben fan feels this way.  When I first downloaded that song two months ago (nothing else though, I bought the CD march 11th for support, not burned) I could help but play it over again and again because it is just that ROCKIN.  I suggest that guy take another listen.<BR>  As with any new material, it is hard for listeners to allow the newbies on DOTI into the sacred categories as Walk Away, Burn One Down, By My Side, Breakin Down, Show Me A Little More Shame, but I assure you, after a little bit of repeated listenings and some touring (how bout in the US for once, Ben), I am sure that the majority of DOTI (esp. numbers 2,3,6,8,14) will be among the Ben Harper favorites.
B000031WD9|5.0|Forget what ever you may have heard.  This is one of the funniest movies ever.  The virtual unknown cast (at the time it was made) makes this a cult classic and the measuring stick movie for generations to come.  The antics of the gang will have you laughing from start to finish.  And Jim's dad...wow!  He is funny as heck!  You can not go wrong with this one.  So much better than the sequal.  For anyone who had &quot;one of those years&quot; in high school, you must see this movie.
0449002128|2.0|Daniel Silva is one of those authors whose name gradually becomes familiar. I decided to pick up some of his novels after hearing favorable reviews on his latest book. I have just finished the Kill Artist and it was......OK. In my opinion, it took a long time for the plot to develop, halfway through the book I was ready for some kind of action.  I also soon grew tired of the flashbacks and wanted the story to progress in the here and now. The novel did improve near the end but by then I was just slogging through the thing.<BR>Hope the next one I read is an improvement.
B00005JL78|5.0|Forget MI2, this is the Cruise movie you want to see.  It's long, but the story gets deeper and deeper as you go right up to a surprise ending.  My only complaint is this is like the millionth movie in the last year with Colin Farrell.  Enough is enough with him, he's not that good of an actor but he's been in WAY WAY WAY to many movies lately.  Anyway, back to minority report.  Very cool special effects.  Great story.  You won't be dissapointed.  Everyone runs!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Female jazz singers should have smoky-sweet voices and sound like they're telling their life stories to their best friend or lover.  Norah Jones is just such a jazz singer.  She deserved every award she got at the recent Emmy's.
6304981635|5.0|Bruce Lee, enough said.  By far the best of all his movies.  The story is a bit campy, but the action more than makes up for it.  The final fight is by far the best EVER on film.  If you at all like karate movies, this is the one for you!
B0000009SY|5.0|What can i say about one of the greatest ever albums in the history of rock music? brilliant? fantastic? tremendus? propably is very difficult to find the right word for it. By far the greatest work of Frank Zappa, and if i had to chose the 10 greatest albums in the history of rock, joe's garage acts i,ii &amp; iii will be in. <BR>Joe's garage is a double CD concept album, telling the strange story of joe, a young and amateur musician.<BR>Most of the songs here are so great...<BR>From the title track to 'Stick it out', and from 'Outside now' to 'Packard goose'. But, the greatest is the instrumental 'Watermelon in Easter Hay'. Zappa's best guitar solo....you have to listen over and over to undestand and feel tha magic...trully a music masterpiece.<br />If you are a Frank Zappa fan or not, if you are a rock fan or not, go immediatelly and listen to joe's garage album. After that you will become a Zappa fan for sure.<br />Thank you very much Frank for everything. You're gone but you still live in our hearts, in our minds and (most important) in our ears, because...MUSIC IS THE BEST.
0767817710|5.0|Right off the bat you have two reasons to watch this.  Leo DiCaprio DIES, YES!  And the special effects are awesome.  Not your typical western by any means, but the story is very entertaining.  The cast is full of all stars.  And Sharon Stone is hot as hell as always.  This is perfect for the casual fan of westerns because it is a modern day action flick just set in that time period.  Check it out!
B00004XONN|5.0|Merely writing this review to improve the overall rating.  A few words - this is Radiohead's finest album to date.  Conceived as an album rather than song by song, it is their most risque stab yet at stepping outside of the bounds of conventional pop while still straddling the mainstream.  For anyone interested in good, profound, daring, heady music.<BR>Despite their international rock star status, this album beats any indie rock/idm album any day.
B00008AY3L|5.0|&quot;diamonds on the inside&quot; is in my opinion the best album of the year so far.  its ecletic and flowing tracks take you to places unimaginable.  bring it on: reggae, bluegrass, folk, tribal, rock, alternative, r&amp;b/soul, jazz and of course the funk...this album has everything!  the music is just so organic.  great production.  great lyrics.  some of the best written songs I've ever heard.  each track grows on you the more you listen to it.   I have been listening to this record non-stop for the past 3 days!  a must for any music lover's collection.  my favourite tracks are &quot;With My Own Two Hands,&quot; &quot;Diamonds On the Inside,&quot; and &quot;Bring The Funk,&quot; although there is not one track on this cd that I didn't enjoy.
B00005CDNK|5.0|This is different from other Abba albums. Gone are the bright, cheerful songs that had become their trademark. Although the album still contains some upbeat melodies, these only serve to hide the fact that Abba, by this time, were at an end, at least spiritually. That they were still able to produce a quality album is a measure of their talent and class. Even so, I generally prefer their earlier music.<br />The big hit from this album is One of us, which stands comparison with any of their earlier classics. It was to be their last major worldwide hit. Its B-side, Should I laugh or cry, was not included on the original album but appears here as the first of four bonus tracks.<br />Head over heels was a top 30 British hit, while When all is said and done was an American hit. After that, Abba had two more British hits, both of which were recorded after the album was released. The first of these, Under attack, is wonderful, but the second, The day before you came, is (to my ears) pure magic. It was the last song ever recorded by Abba. Its B-side was Cassandra. Those three songs have all been added as bonus tracks to this CD.<br />Of the other tracks here, Slipping through my fingers is perhaps the best. While by no means my favorite Abba album, this has a lot to commend it. I play it less than Abba's earlier music but I wouldn't be without it.
B00005R0W6|1.0|Just a heads up, there's only one extra track on this cd, and it's trenchtown rock (live). Otherwise, it's exactly the same except the writting on the inside is japanese. So you might be utterly dissappointed.
0440180295|5.0|This was the first Vonnegut I've read and so far it's my favorite.  I am amazed how Vonnegut can contrive wildly imaginative stories and tie them together in a meaningful way.  Slaughterhouse-Five is a story about a story of a Billy Pilgrim who becomes unstuck in time and relives different moments of his life.  At the surface it seems he is just suffering from delusions from his war experiences.  But the narrator makes us believe he has discovered a 'truth' from the Tralfamadorians about the nature of time, that it is not linear like beads on a string but comprised of almost independent moments, and one could jump among them and perhaps see them backwards.  Instead of making Billy crazy these ideas make him sympathetic, because they provide a different and beautiful way of looking at human issues of loss and regret.<br />Vonnegut somehow combines an interesting story, drama, and subtle humor that you may not spot the first time around in a very readable novel.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I just purchased the new DVD release of Eraserhead from the David Lynch website and I am happy to report that it is superb!!!<BR>The extras include a story as told by David Lynch himself about the making of the film. Priceless!!! The quality is as I have reported!!! Yes I know that the film is dark, disturbing and like a dream that you would not like to have but as a cinematic work of ART it is excellent!!! It is a collectable for the collector. I am severely pleased that this \\"new\\" DVD release was very well done. I hope that it is released soon to the general public so that they might experience Eraserhead in a format that is \\"as good as it gets!\\". Thank You David Lynch for a job well done!

0553573403|5.0|Fabulous book that you'll read several times, and its better every time. Maybe the best series in fantasy other than Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time.
B0000255CL|5.0|This CD is amazing, the guitar solos are ass kicking! and Abbath's vocals go well with the music. This is great black metal, Immortal is one of the finest black metal bands out there. In my opinion, every song on this album is wonderful, If you love black metal, then this CD is for you! It's worth your money and time. The Best 2 songs here are :  At the Heart of Winter, and Solarfall.
B00008IAMD|4.0|Beleive it or not, I heard \\"Hurt\\" on an alternative rock station, which meant this album must be something special. When I played it for the first time, I found it to be a dark, disturbing recording.  Cash covers \\"Hurt\\" better than Trent Reznor, because he has lived the lyrics through the years of pain, the drug abuse, his battle with Hodgekins Disease, and bitterness.  I have to deduct one star for \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\" for Fiona Apple's less than stella backup.<BR>This album is for all forms of music lovers.
B00005OWIU|4.0|Aloha-<br />This is a wonderful soundtrack; HOWEVER<br />the most wonderful track was left out - the one where Harry enters Diagon Alley for the first time, and he sees that everyone around him is magickal....<br />AND <br />when the first-years are led into the Great Hall by Professor McGonagall and they see the splendor of the Hogwarts ceiling and tables of classmates that seem to stretch on forever. <br />I, like the reviewer from Shawnee, KS was very disappointed that the track was not on the CD - to me, it's very uplifting. <br />Otherwise, it's still a good buy.
1400034779|5.0|There is nothing not to like about this little book. It is well written, colorful and unique. From the moment we meet Mma Ramotswe and follow her story from girlhood, through an abusive marriage and into her ambitious foray as the proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, she earns our respect and admiration-just as she shows respect and admiration for everything around her. Alexander McCall Smith captures the character and culture of Gaborone, a village in Botswana, and tells a sweet and entertaining story. I've noticed other reviewers label it a mystery; however, in my opinion it is a series of mysteries--one about a missing boy kidnapped by witch doctors winds through the book, and others unfold in each chapter where new cases are presented to the fledgling agency. A wonderful and charming book, which I highly recommend.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.
0385720920|4.0|Gozer the Traveler. He will come in one of the prechosen forms. During the rectification of the vuldronai, the traveler came as a large and moving Tor, then during the third reconcilliation of the last of the mickendri supplicants, Gozer chose a new form for him, that of a giant Slore. Many Schubbs and Zools knew what it was like to be roasted in the depths of the Slore that day, I can tell you.<br />The creature Gozer the Gozarian, Gozer the destructor, forgaseedrahadd the traveler has come. Choose and perish. Choose. Choose the form of the destructor. The choice is made. The traveler has come.
0060977493|5.0|This is a stellar piece of literature.  I wish I could give more than 5 stars.  I have read this book every year since the year it came out- and everytime I get a new experience out of it and love it even more.  Faulknerian in many aspects, you have to read it more than once to get the true essence of it.  The way she lapses through times and character viewpoints is exceptional and truly formulates the story.  She develops characters in a way that you feel as if you knew them your whole life and understand them.  She delves into the minds of two 7 year old twins with mastery and empathy.  She brings out the torrent of conflicts, ironic disputes, and antics both shameless and endearing of an Indian family in Marxist Kerala as if she is painting true life with the brush of an artist.  She illustrates a whole array of emotions with one word sometimes.  Truly, this is an amazing book.  For anyone who says that it is not coherent-they have not truly read this fine piece of art.  Definitley one of the best novels I have ever read.
0767802489|5.0|This movie is simply amazing.. Its hard to know how to describe the impact it had on me except to say that it is the slowest movie that I have ever seen that DID NOT BORE ME FOR A SECOND. <br />The tale of a German submarine that is sunk (sort of.. that's not a spoiler), this movie has some of the most awe-inspiring portrayals of the horror of war and the struggle of man to overcome all obstacles I have ever seen.<br />The visuals are amazing, from the way the condensation gathers on the bulkheads to the way the characters slowly become more grimy, bag-eyed and filled with dread as the movie progresses. At each turn, this movie draws you in and makes you feel as if you are right there, trapped in the submarine with them.<br />There is one scene involving a U-Boat and a Destroyer which I won't spoil that really reinforces the humanity of people who are easy to write off as the 'enemy'. This movie serves as an excellent reminder that while war is a dreadful thing (albeit sometimes necessary), everyone involved is riding along on the same human condition.<br />One of the best movies I have ever seen. The only people who won't like this are those addicted to non-stop action (which I like too) only. For the rest of you, do not hesitate to buy this movie!!
B00008BXJF|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this album is very well arranged and performed, nevertheless in my opinion Frypp&C. are not able to change radically route. That is They have not been clever enough in order to make a true renewal of their sounds, regarding above all the original arrangements and the rational lay-out of the songs too:for instance the track \\"Elektrik\\" has the same dynamic range and arpeggios as well, typical of \\"Lark's tongue in aspic\\"; \\"Eyes wide open\\" is the only one quite atypical, as it seems a music piece of Peter Gabriel, but it isn't a solid attempt to make a true renewal of their sound!! The opener title track is interesting, with its first A Cappella-version and the normal version afterwards, but more electronically oriented than the poliphonic excursions by Yes for example, that I should have appreciated much more (even though of course I can not ask King Crimson for emulating Yes!!)... \\"Level Five\\" is interesting, but once again it seems a modern version of \\"Lark's tongue in aspic\\" ...to me the real turn of their music direction, is represented by the track \\"Happy with what you have to be happy with\\", which was issued 5 months ago as an EP-CD,and it was a true promise!! The sound indeed was fresh and dynamic too, remaining still today the main attraction of the new album \\"The power to believe, even though of course according to their usual mood!! The track \\"Dangerous curves\\" to me doesn't add anything else to the good quality level, in the average of almost the whole last KC's publications, except on the previous \\"Konstruction of light\\", which was a bit boring and less well arranged than \\"Power to believe\\";\\"Konstruction...\\" in fact, in comparison for instance to the splendid \\"Thrak\\", was a backward step... naturally in some moments this latter resembled the sound of \\"Red\\", in a modern version, but there were fresh music ideas and a great rhytmical section as well, thanks to Bill Bruford and Pat Mastellotto, so that was one of the best KC's issues of thelast decade!!But coming back to the present publication, I think of a promising come back, despite of FRIPP&C. maintaining the typical King Crimson trademark, an infinite \\"loop\\" through the decades!!<br />It's not a masterpiece, but is real good!!
B00005JKCH|4.0|Let me say right off that if you are a comic book fanatic and want purity in all 'translations' to the big screen, you are going to have some problems with this movie. The creators took some liberties with the storyline so as to make it appeal to the masses. This is a pretty typical tendency that you see with most comic book (Xmen, Hulk, Punisher) and fantasy (Lord of the Rings, D&amp;D) movies.<br />An entertaining movie with some great visuals, it nevertheless suffers in a few places from some absolutely AWFUL dialogue.. Talk about cheese.. FEH! There are some lines in this movie that made me want to track down the actor/actress just so I can ask if they cracked up after delivering them..<br />Entertaining.. worth the price, but get your wine ready..
B000022TSY|3.0|As good as Easy Rider is, it is not the type of movie that is going to pull in younger crowds.. The message of peacefulness and community with its underlying criticism of those who take this concept to brain-dead stages is one that stands the test of time.<br />Unfortunately, the mechanics of the movie itself simply do not. Nicholson, Hopper and Fonda all give great performances. However, this movie is always going to appeal more to the peace and flower power crowd than the [chemical] genre crowd.. For the latter, this movie simply cannot compete with Trainspotting, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, etc..
1563898586|5.0|I picked up this book just because it was Alan Moore's latest, his works including From Hell, Watchman among others.  Shortly after I picked it up, I heard it was getting Hollywood treatment, with Sean Connery its main star- another reason to pick it up.  If Watchman and From Hell had more serious tone into it, with heavy subject matters of likes of schizophrenia, murder, deconstruction of super heroes, this one is more close to swash buckling adventures- no hard theme, no hard language, just pure fun.  But it is witty and imaginery, for it incorporates many literary figures ranging from Sherlock Holmes to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea to The Invisible Man to Dracula, all created during late 19th century-early 20th century.  I recommend this to virutally anyone who wants to read something for fun, and read some of the books I mentioned above.  Worth your time and money.
B00005NGAL|5.0|This musical is my favorite musical of all. Even though I own the entire Andrew Lloyd Webber Spotlight Collection, I watch Cats more than any of the other three. Ever since I first saw this musical for the first time in person in Minnesota, I have remembered it ever since. If you like good performance or simply love great music and dancing, you should see this muiscal. I give it two big thumbs up. I applaude Andrew Lloyd Webber on this phenominal musical. Cats is an expereince you'll never forget. <br />Here are the cats that stand out to me in the cast of characters: Rum Tum Tugger (John Partridge):a real styllish, lady cat's man, just look at and listen to him him sing and dance. Munkustrap (Michael Gruber): the leader of the clan and main story teller. Demeter (Aeva May): the most couragous, spirited of all the female cats. Magical Mr. Mistoffelees (Jacob Brent): a real dancer and magician, he brings out all the magic and power of Cats. Macavity (Bryn Walters): the original criminal mystery cat, with all the moves and fire. Bombalurina (Rosemarie Ford): the most leading of the female cats, who's always there in the most exciting of moments. Victoria (Phillida Crowley Smith): the most graceful, royal, exotic and lithe cat on the cast. Cassanrda (Rebecca Parker): the royal, worshiped cat of Egypt.<br />Oh, and just in case you read my review, Jo Gibb, I send you all my priase and attention.  Nice work.  You looked so great in your cat suit!
0812548094|5.0|Classic Goodkind... just as good as Wizard's First Rule. I actually started reading this one first, got hooked, and had to read the first book. The characters are amazing and the story is the best any author could have come up with. This book solidifies Goodkind's position as one of the greatest authors of all time. <br />You'll love Gratch! I loved Gratch. Gratch is great.<br />Word Ninja
B00003CXA4|5.0|&quot;Gandhi&quot; is one of the best movies ever made. Ben Kingsley is in his perfect role as Mohandas K. &quot;Mahatma&quot; Gandhi, who was originally a lawyer, and later an Indian political leader, who was into non-violent beliefs. This movie is the winner of 8 well-deserved Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor (Kingsley), and Best Director (Richard Attenborough). The DVD is a must.
0486282112|5.0|Shelley was only 18 when she wrote this?! Incredible! The reason for this being a classic is obvious--a stellar story about a mad scientist and his objectives gone awry. I've learned a lot about the time period, as well, despite the few anachronisms throughout. Shelley did a fabuous job with this novel and I hope it remains in its rightful place in the canons of literature.<br />Word Ninja
B00006RU5B|5.0|Wow is all I have to say about this cd.  It is just awesome.  I mean the raw emotion you can hear in Chris Cornell's voice when he sings songs Like A Stone, or Shadow of the Sun just make this CD falt out spectacular.  Quite possibly the BEST CD I own or have ever heard.  The songs are just so awesome.  Heavy guitar rifts, mixing with heavy drums and raw, emotional vocals make this CD what it is.  There is not one bad sng on the entire CD, but, my favorite songs go in from the Cd go in this order:<br />1. Like Stone <BR>2. Shadow Of The Sun<BR>3. Getaway Car<BR>4. Show Me How To Live<BR>5. Exploder<BR>6. Cochise<BR>7. What You Are<BR>8. Gasoline<BR>9. The Last Remaining Light<BR>10. Set It Off<BR>11. Light My Way<BR>12. Bring Em Back Alive<BR>13. I Am The Highway<BR>14. Hypnotize
B00006879E|5.0|An enjoyable record. This album is a great story if you listen to it. A love/hate relationship splayed out in the most wonderful of ways. It's creative, funky, soulful, and incredibly original eventhough the whole album is about love. Some tracks (two in particular) are too poppy (This Love & She Will Be Loved) but those two songs are examples of the good Pop.<br />Best tracks (to me) include:<BR>This Love<BR>Sunday Morning<BR>The Sun<BR>Secret<BR>Sweetest Goodbye<br />Basically, this is a wonderful peice of work.

The book also gets you thinking of your own life and if your living the way you want to be.  This book is a really good story ,and I do recommend this book if you want to read about a real person in a realistic situation.

B0000844IT|4.0|Anchor Bay is my favorite company that produces DVD's because of their quality and the fact that they release many obscure titles that most companies would pass by.<br />With that said, i'm a little frustrated with so many Re-Releases lately. The BOOMSTICK edition of Army Of Darkness is nice, but the package is a little flimsy. It comes in a cardboard sleeve and the 2 DVD discs are in a foldout case with the booklet stuck in the middle (not attached to the case). You'll need to take care of this one or the cover will surely become worn. It's also not all that easy to slide the cover back on the case that holds the discs.<br />The movie(s) of Army Of Darkness are both previous editions released on seperate DVD editions. First we have the original Theatrical Version with the option of viewing the original ending seperately. The video and sound quality are excellent on this version. The Unrated version on the 2nd DVD contains about 15 minutes of added footage and you can tell the difference easily. The quality of the added scenes is below average. It is grainy and looks like raw footage. It is watchable but it detracts from the overall viewing experience. The audio on the unrated version is only in Dolby 2.0 stereo, where the Rated version on the 1st DVD has Dolby 5.1 surround.<br />If you like the movie, then this is the edition you need. There are some great extra features that any fan will enjoy. It is indeed a great set, aside from the packaging. I just hope they don't re-re-re-re-re-release it next year again!!!
B000066NW0|2.0|Avril Lavigne has a lot of talent for her age but she can't really make up her mind. I've read some of her interviews and in each one she says something else. Some she says \\"I'm trying to use the REAL meaning of punk in my music\\" while others she says \\"I was never trying to be punk that was jsut a stereostpye from how I dress\\" I guess you can't really expect a girl her age to really be able to make up her mind and stick with it. <br />More annoying though is how she had a whole section in time magazine saying how she was like \\"anti-britney\\" and didn't want to be portrayed as a sex object... about a month later she was on the sover of Rolling Stone with the whole like Hair waving in the wind and shtuff going on. Whoever the kid on the osbournes is, was at some place with like famous peoples shtuff. He held the picture of her up next to one of Britneys out fits. Whatever Avril was wearing was almsot identical Britneys. Can you say hypocrite?<br />So yea Avril has a really nice voice but she acts like a confused teenager far too much for my liking. <br />Oh yea and her music is pop ok? It's not punk for those of you who have the lil' tie and everything. Punk is political rock basically i.e The Sex Pistols, The Clash, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, Anti-Flag, X, and stuff like that. (Millencolin, Hot Water Music and stuff like that is like new-age punk which is kinda strange) <br />But if your into the pop scence like Britney, Shakira, Christina, J-Lo then Avril is another sensation for you to idolize over<br />So I give Avril only 2 stars mainly because she thinks so many false things about herself. 1 star was given to her cuz she has a nice voice and is hot ;-)
B00006RIO7|5.0|The music in Chicago is incredible! Even without the razzle dazzle of the movie, the songs still are just as exhilirating and fun to sing along with. I listen to the CD at least twice a day and I'm still not sick of it. Although the better music is in the first half of the CD the second half is still awesome. I reccomend you buy this!
0783229364|4.0|A pure fluff and fun movie with a rather clever theme.  Helen Slater was a last minute replacement and her performance is a bit wooden but adequate for this very enjoyable film.  A nice addition to the comedy section of your DVD collection.
B00008AY3L|4.0|Its almost not fair to have to compare this record to the rest of Ben Harper's body of work, because he has set such a high standard with his 1st four studio releases.  The record starts out on a very high note as Ben sings \\"I can change the world, with my own two hands\\" as he carries the torch for Bob Marley on \\"With My Own Two Hands\\".  From there we are treated to a dazzling mix of Folk, Reggae, Funk, Rock, Soul, Blues & Gospel.  What's amazing about Harper is he can pull off all these styles without sounding the least bit pretentious.  However if there is a weakness on this record its the uptempo rock stuff, \\"So High, So Low\\" being a near miss at best.  Likewise, the funk stuff succeeds slightly but it doesn't really inspire. While DOTI isn't one of Harper's stronger efforts (again, his standard is very high), songs like \\"With My Own Two Hands\\", \\"Diamonds On The Indside\\", \\"Touch From Your Lust\\" & \\"Amen Omen\\" make this a worthwhile affair and are sure to go down as BH classics...
B000002UVZ|5.0|This fourth outing by Alanta, Georgia's darlings is by no means my personal favorite of theirs, nor is it the one that might be looked at as their all defining classic (So far it seems like \\"Murmurs\\" or \\"Automatic\\" get that nod).  Everytime I listen to it, however, I just get the feeling that this record is THE REM sound distilled and perfected, in the best way possible.  As a result, I think this would have to be the record of theirs I would reccommend to the burgeoning REM fan.<br />Everything that marks them as one of the great American bands is here.  They rock out, and quite hard, on bombastic tracks like \\"These Days\\" and \\"Just a Touch.\\"  Michael Stipe's vocals made the metamorphosis to almost perfect clarity, yet there's still some of his coyness and vocal stuttering that made his style pre-\\"Pageant\\" so lovable.  His lyrics take on passionate meaning, especially on \\"Cuyahoga,\\" one of their greatest political and humanitarian statements ever made.  \\"Flowers of Guatemala\\" is a touching song on the sanctity and beauty of life.  \\"Hyaena\\" and \\"I Believe\\" are also pretty bombastic in their own right, with genius silly wordplay from Stipe.  The musicians are tighter than ever, too: one listen to \\"Fall on Me,\\" with Mike Mills' bassline buoying the song as Peter Buck lays down shimmering, blistering guitar lines and Bill Berry keeps up pace on drums, and you know they're something special.  The only sour note is \\"Swan Swan H,\\" with the most nonsense, nasaly vocal Stipe has ever done, but it does little to kill the bouncy mood of the rest of the record.  Besides, Mike Mills' killer cover of \\"Superman\\" comes next as a secret track, and closes the record on a high note.<br />In a nutshell, they've never done anything this exhilirating on any of their other albums, though each of their records definitely have something special to offer.  It's such a perfect summary of what REM is, that if you're wanting to start with the band and don't know where, this record couldn't comemore highly reccommended.  Just get their other 11 albums, too...
B00004W55E|5.0|I went to the library to get this album, and after I listened to it, I wondered why I didn't listen to it sooner. I've always liked Rachelle Ferrell, and although I haven't heard her other albums, I still think this one might outdo them because I think few people have heard an album as great as this.<br />I don't know if it's possible to pick any one song as being the best on here, but I'll at least point out some highlights that come to mind. Rachelle can still hit the high notes very well (see \\"Run To Me\\") as well as the low notes. Also, the first three songs will sort of make you wish this CD would never end.<br />Although it's obvious that Rachelle can hold her own on songs, the duets are also stellar. \\"Gaia\\" features Jonathan Butler, and although that track is damn good, \\"Reflections Of My Heart\\" with Russ Barnes beats it (I don't know who he is, but if he has an album in the works, I wish it came out yesterday). Kenny Lattimore sings background for a few tracks, while the great George Duke takes care of music here and there. That's a winning combination, wouldn't you say?<br />Another thing about this album is that sometimes the wordplay is more interesting than the lyrics, not that the lyrics are bad. If someone just looked at the lyrics without listening to the songs, for example, s/he might say the lyrics just seem okay, but it all depends on how Rachelle says them.<br />And speaking of lyrics, the songs on here cover topics that are really original, like on \\"Will You Remember Me?\\" where she says to her man: \\"I understand looking at other women is part of being a man.\\" WHO'S THE TRAITOR THAT TOLD HER THAT??? ...But seriously, Rachelle should have known she had a classic when she wrote (or co-wrote) every track on this album. Pick it up today, because you'll never get tired of listening to it.
630542845X|5.0|My favorite films are the ones that fly under the radar of critical acclaim (so that expectations are flatlined), only to discover personal treasures that escaped the masses.  Powder is one of those personal treasures.<br />The story is not new (see Forrest Gump, Being There and K-PAX).  Take the &quot;abnormal&quot; personality that, without choice, maintains innocence into adulthood, insert it into a world of &quot;normal&quot; personalities, and watch the paradox unfold.  What sets Powder apart from the others is the depth of emotions evoked from the talents of second tier actors (with the exception of Jeff Goldblum), especially Sean Patrick Flanery as the lead character, and the feeling that you have just witnessed the unbelievable transform into the believable.  Isn't that what good movies do?<br />Powder . . . one of the best I've seen in a while.
B000089RVX|5.0|I am a 50 year old man who has just had his eyes and ears opened to this incredible group of young musicians. The music is powerful, dark and yet...very hopeful. I am a fan of BIG music, and this album has all of that and more! Amy Lee's vocals are as good as it gets.. Passion, fire and control.. Ben Moody is simply an amazing guitarist. He has so much passion in what he plays.. He even hints at the days of guitar solos, putting in runs when appropriate, but never over doing it. These young musicans are superb songwriters and I can only hold my breath at what they could offer next album.. My personal favorite on FALLEN is called WHISPER. It is a ride that just builds until you feel like you have to hold on to something for fear of falling. The choir backup vocals and orchestration is simply breath-taking. The song that first caught my attention is TAKING OVER ME, and it is also a very big sound.. It is rare to find an album that is 100% perfect to a listener.. This album has 11 songs, and I am thrilled at every one of them.. MONEY WELL SPENT ON THIS RELEASE!!
044022425X|5.0|I really love Drums of Autumn.  Of the first four books in the Gabaldon series, this is my second favorite, easily (nothing can touch Outlander, of course).  I loved getting to know Roger better, and cried and worried about him all through the book.
B00005JLSC|5.0|There aren't enough words that I can come up with to say how amazing that \\"Chicago\\" really is. This movie, actually a musical, is a stunning array of music, amazing dancing acts, great storylines, and a whole sense of fun woven into the dark and dramatic theme of this movie. There haven't been many musicals in recent years due to the lack of popularity during recent times and naturally, I'm not a big fan of musicals but I think that Chicago brings new life into this genre of movies and has paved the way to bringing musicals back into the front spotlight again for the new generations of movie-goers. DANGER: Possible spoilers ahead, hopefully not.<br />Set in the Jazz Age of the early 1920s, Al Capone was rising to become the notorious Prohibition Era gangster leader, and new fashion trends were causing an uproar. Outside the shadow of Capone's looming shadow, this movie is a tale of two well known dancers who are suspected of killing their husbands after an affair. Roxie Art, who faces possible execution for murdering her abusive boyfriend who constantly rejected her and her estranged husband Amos refused to take blame for it, seeks a money hungry, never-lost-a-case lawyer named William Flynn played by Richard Gere to win her freedom and also her road to stardom and to flee from her estranged husband Amos.<br />The songs that accompany the individual events are so much fun to listen to, combined with the dancing performances by the individual characters. Personally, I love the Big Band and ragtime music that accompanies the movie scenes and the performers and stage performances are amazing. All of the characters in \\"Chicago\\" are amazing but for me, it's a toss up between Queen Latifah as Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton, Catherine Zeta Jones as Velma Kelley, and Richard Gere as William Flynn. Except for Flynn who is their lawyer, they are all charged with the murders of their `loved' ones who have been unfaithful to them and their desire for revenge drove them to madness. All of the songs that accompany each of the scenarios are innovative and absolute brilliance. The entire cast surpassed all of my expectations in this musical and gave them a whole new image of skill, intelligence, and depth to their characters. I love also seeing the movie flip between the dramatic scenes of Roxie in prison and then the stage performances.<br />Queen Latifah steals part of the spotlight as the elegant Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton. Morton offers Roxie Art a deal to get $3K to a lawyer by the name of William `Billy' Flynn who has `never lost a trial' to testify in her favor. Her ruthless `drill sergeant' attitude is classic and sometimes even funny although its humor factor is basically from the big band music that plays along during the scenes. Latifah's vocals are astounding. There's a funny yet good message in her song too. The other half of the spotlight is stolen by Catherine Zeta Jones. Velma Kelley play by Jones is also jailed for murdering two people, though it took place before \\"Chicago\\" started. Her manipulative personality brings a large amount of conflict to the musical, not to mention a sense of mystery. I've heard a lot about that Catherine was a dancer for many years and Between Jones and Zellweger, it's obvious for many years and had all the skills needed whereas Zellweger definitely showed a bit of newbie performances but still both are great. Velma is an incredible character too and Zeta Jones is a wonderful singer in this film. As Roxie gains the fame that she has longed for though, Velma is forgotten by many and a bitter rivalry ensues between them. Yes, Roxie is a great dancer but isn't anywhere close to Velma's dancing skills in my opinion. Richard Gere though is another standout as the semi-sleazy lawyer Flynn who seems to get the women characters nuts over him. I must honestly say, I never thought that Richard Gere could sing but man, he can SING. I would even say that Richard Gere can sing even better than a lot of commercial pop singers in the radio I must add. ;) My favorite scene was William Flynn performing the puppet scene and also Amos singing his song about him being rejected by his wife and being overlooked by the general public called \\"Mr. Cellophane\\".<br />This movie was nominated for a whopping13 Academy Awards for every category except for Best Actor, and won 3 Golden Globes. \\"Chicago\\" got its justice with the numerous nominations as it's one of the best musicals to ever come to the big screen in modern times, considering how `out-of-fashion' it seemed immediately before \\"Moulin Rouge\\" came along last year and brought musicals back to life for a new generation of musical fans for the new generation and for the generations of the 21st century. Maybe \\"Chicago\\" might have been somewhat overhyped but, it's rare that I say this but, it lived up to the hype that surrounded it and is destined to become a classic in the near future.  For some extra trivia, I myself am native to Chicago and I guess for this reason this movie means so much more to me than it would've otherwise had I not been a Native Chicagoan. Go and see this movie before it's too late as it won't have anywhere near the punch on the small screen like it did the on the movie theatre.s in the radio I must add. ;) My favorite scene was William Flynn performing the puppet scene and also Amos singing his song about him being rejected by his wife and being overlooked by the general public called \\"Mr. Cellophane\\".  <br />This movie was nominated for a whopping13 Academy Awards for every category except for Best Actor, and won 3 Golden Globes. \\"Chicago\\" got its justice with the numerous nominations as it's one of the best musicals to ever come to the big screen in modern times, considering how `out-of-fashion' it seemed immediately before \\"Moulin Rouge\\" came along last year and brought musicals back to life for a new generation of musical fans for the new generation and for the generations of the 21st century.

0780631684|2.0|there's not much to say about this movie.  it's just a bunch of pretty teens running from death because they were also meant to die in the plane, ok whatever.  so, the rest of this movie is over an hour of teens running around, looking attractive and getting killed in the most silly ways. yeah, the director tried to make the deaths brutal, but with the cgi effects, it just looks dumb and phony.  the 70's-80's horror movies that had all these death scenes looked a lot more realistic, even the real cheesy ones.  they looked a lot better than this i assure you.  also, none of the deaths come to you with suspence, it's the same formula over and over. formula=one false scare, then the real thing.  for example: boy plugs in radio, water seeps up to him, no not an electicution, instead boy slips on water and gets strangled by a cord, and repeat about 5-6 more times and there's the formula for the deaths.
B000002MJC|5.0|\\"Violator\\" represented Depeche Mode's commercial peak but in my opinion, it's their follow-up \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" that I consider their creative peak. Depeche Mode's multi-platinum success with \\"Violator\\" left many fans anticipating a possible sequel to that following four hit singles off that album. However, Depeche Mode by no means were in the mood to create a \\"Violator Part 2\\". Instead, their 1993 opus \\"Songs Of Faith & Devotion\\" was a complete change in style from their \\"Violator\\" album, by incorporating a more guitar-based texture, borrowing some elements of the grunge movement going on during the time of this album's release but still, even with a tiny dabbling of grunge elements, this album has a completely different feel from any of the great rock albums that came out during that trend. This album doesn't even sound dated at all. Much of their music has aged a lot better than a lot of their contemporaries.<br />The music is much rougher, harder edged and much darker and more eerie than \\"Violator\\" in a way. The scratching record sound effect at the beginning of the opening track \\"I Feel You\\" definitely was the final nail in the coffin of their 1980s sound. The album also would foreshadow the destruction, and downward spiral that the band would go in, following this period of their career, with Gahan almost losing his life but recovering, before bouncing back after with \\"Ultra\\" and that kind of gives this album an even darker mood. There's a very strong sense of self-loathing, and tension within the album and it showcased the tension that would ultimately result in Alan Wilder calling it quits with the band in 1995 to focus on Recoil. Many fans sadly dismissed this album as too different but for me, I completely embraced the change as it is in fact, among the strongest albums that Depeche Mode has ever made. I would even go far as to say that I like this better than \\"Violator\\" or \\"Exciter\\" but not as much as \\"Black Celebration\\", and it ties with \\"Music For The Masses\\" and \\"Ultra\\" as my second favorite record of theirs.<br />For me, it's hard to exactly rank their albums besides their 1986 masterpiece \\"Black Celebration\\" but that's alright as their post-1983 albums have so much great music that it propels them to about the same level of greatness, beauty, darkness, and intelligence. I don't understand why so many seem to hate this album. Gee, would you rather listen to the popcorn of \\"Boys Say Go\\" over \\"Walking In My Shoes\\"? I don't think so. No offense to the former. There are a couple of speed bumps though along the wrecking journery, even though there aren't any filler on this album. \\"Condemnation\\" sounds too mellow and too Gospel, bluesy, and feels out of place on here but it's still a good song. \\"One Caress\\", while a good song musically, feels highly out of place on this album against the rock-edged songs, especially against \\"I Feel You\\", and \\"Rush\\".  Despite its misplaced feel, \\"One Caress\\" is yet a great song.<br />The whole album as a whole has a dark and beautiful sense of traveling along a busy and winding road through the city on a turbulent stormy evening, especially with \\"Walking In My Shoes\\" and \\"Higher Love\\", both of which build to unspeakable climaxes and the latter echoes away, leaving me wanting even more. \\"Mercy In You\\" is the prime example of the stormy atmosphere that I'm talking about with it's bizarre, rocking sound and then it's haunting ambience during the climax and then fading into keyboard dabblings and fading out. \\"Judas\\" gets my nod as the most unsettling classic on the entire album. It starts with deathlike Uillean pipes and giving a sense of a fiery sunset evening before becoming an ominous and droning song with wobbly guitars and echoing beat and building up into an intense orchestral climax, like something's about to happen. \\"Rush\\" almost starts treading into Nine Inch Nails territory with it's ominous and harsh electronic production reminiscent of Flood.<br />Casual fans or those who like their 1980s albums may not come to liking this album a whole lot due to its heavy style and dark-edged style but those who are striving to hear something different and dark, this album is a definite must have and should be in every true DM fans collection. I would even go far as to say that it's better than \\"Violator\\" at times, due to it's highly creative, intense, and somewhat frightening atmosphere but from my perspective, it's a sexy scare and that is what makes some albums so incredibly powerful. This album is by all means an essential need and I ask that all fans of true music and art to go and get this album. Depeche Mode would go into a new change in sound with 1997's \\"Ultra\\", also an essential masterpiece. Depeche Mode remain a strong and consistent band to this very day and continue to put out a string of great albums.those who like their 1980s albums may not come to liking this album a whole lot due to its heavy style and dark-edged style but those who are striving to hear something different and dark, this album is a definite must have and should be in every true DM fans collection.

B000063UV9|5.0|BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID is a story about two characters in Wyoming who pull several train holdups and bank robberies before being pursued relentlessly by posses. They end up in Bolivia where their luck runs out as the last we see of them Butch and Sundance are in a shootout with a large contingent from the Bolivian Army. Do they survive or do they die in a hail of gunfire? That is the big unanswered question.<br />The movie contains lots of action as well as a good deal of comedy. Don't miss that scene-stealing rascal Strother martin. He is up to his old tricks again in this one.<br />According to the Internet Movie Database, Dustin Hoffman was considered for the part of Butch Cassidy and Steve McQueen almost took the role of Sundance. How much difference would this have made in the final product? I would bet that either substitution would not have resulted in an improvement.<br />The big competition in 1969 for Oscars came from MIDNIGHT COWBOY, TRUE GRIT and THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE. In spite of the tough field, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID still managed to win nominations for Best Picture, Director and Sound.
0783226063|2.0|If you watched this movie when it was originally in theaters, you will be badly surprised with the number of deleted scenes and content without which it is impossible to draw a parallel with the original master piece - F. Herbert's book.<br />The DVD version of the movie is atrociously cut and it's hardly worth renting, let alone purchasing it.<br />Technically, the sound and picture are good enough - nothing about it could make the overall impression better.<br />In terms of characters, Alia's and Baron's personalities could have been worked out better, but in the whole context their appearance is equally mediocre.<br />The writer of this review watched all other versions of Dune and also read the original book - perhaps if the director had more saying, this (disappointment) would not have happened.
B000089RVX|5.0|I LOVE this album.   Amy's voice is without an equal, the dark haunting sounds of this album are tragic and beautiful.  As an Arkansas native I'm amazed that a band of this type and talent started in Little Rock.  This is one of my favorite CDs..I listen to it almost exclusively and I encourage any true music fan to go out and get a copy IMMEDIATELY!
0140157352|5.0|I've read many books on Negotiation, and use negotition actively and intensly in my day to day worklife.     No book that I have read has given me more tangible & real life advice than this book. The authors, Fisher, Ury (& Patton for 2nd Ed), have done a supurb job at keeping the process of negotiation both simple & thorough.     If you don't like conflict, but don't want to be pushed over by the more aggressive and experienced negotiator...then this book is an absolute must.
B0000844IT|4.0|Let's set one thing straight right off the bat, there are quite a few editions of Army of Darkness avaiable on DVD, and in my previous review of the film I stated that the original edition of the film, not the director's cut or bootleg edition, was the one to own.  I still stand by that statement, but this new edition (which feels like the umpteenth edition of the film) is the one to own if you don't already have any other edition of the film.  You get two discs, one being the original U.S. Theatrical Cut which features all of Ash's great one liners (&quot;good, bad, I'm the one with the gun&quot;) and the S-Mart ending.  The second disc is the bootleg director's cut with the post apocalyptic alternate ending and the whacky commentary from Bruce Campbell, and Sam and Ivan Raimi.  All in all, if you own any other edition of Army of Darkness on DVD, then you might feel a bit cheated if you buy this, but if you don't own any other edition, pick this up; it's a great deal.
B00006JSS8|5.0|I can sum up this review in just a few words. This album is for fans of Stevie Wonder's hits. It does not go into Stevie's obscure masterpieces, of which there are many. But it does highlight the most familiar of Stevie's tunes, while still showcasing one of the most talented musicians of our time. The album begins with his breakthrough live version of Fingertips (Part 2) which I am not very fond of myself, but which has to be included on an album such as this. We are then taken, more or less in sequence, on a journey through time as we grow with this artist's compositional talent. &quot;Little Stevie Wonder&quot; is a phenomenon. And if you didn't truly appreciate just how talented he is before listening to this album, you certainly will afterwards.<br />A great man, a great talent, and a great compilation. 5 Stars.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay, is without a doubt the most diverse, talented band out there today. If someone doesn't agree, it's simply because they are ignorant of the music. They jugde upon hearing one song, which, let's face it, is probably the best song that person has ever come across. Let me get into why this is a great Album...<BR>POLITIK(10/10)- Great, powerful entry into the record. You feel, and get into the banging thrash of the riffs. Strongest song of &quot;Rush of Blood...&quot;<BR>IN MY PLACE(10/10)- No wonder why it was the first single. Colplay really knows how to create beautiful melodies that make simple lyrics seem brilliant.<BR>GOD PUT A SMILE(8/10)- Probably my least favorite song, but if you prefer the constant, mellow tone of &quot;Parachutes&quot;, then this will be your track.<BR>THE SCIENTIST(10/10)- This track somehow has the sound of classic Coldplay with peerless record making. It's a dazzling love song.<BR>CLOCKS(10/10)- Seems to be a public favorite, and it should be. It has a great piano composition, and Martin' voice exudes beauty.<BR>DAYLIGHT(9/10)- Very relaxing feel to this tune. Flows nicely, and is quite mesmerizing.<BR>GREEN EYES(10/10)- This song stood out to me, along with &quot;Scientist&quot; in the beginning. They have a similar feel to them, although this one seems more personal. It has an acoustic feel to it, with the focus on Martin's voice.<BR>WARNING SIGN(10/10)- The music doesn't really grasp you until the chorus, but once you hear it, it's worth the minute wait. &quot;The truth is, I miss you&quot;, he puts it out there with meaning.<BR>A WHISPER(9.5/10)- This song has a mystical tone to it. One of the few songs that lets Chris' voice drop into the background of the instrumental composition. The chorus echos off with Chris repeating &quot;A whisper&quot;, and it works.<BR>A RUSH OF BLOOD(10/10)- Trust me, it may not appeal to you in the beginning, but this chorus will catch up to you quickly. <BR>It brings back the feel of &quot;Bigger,Stronger&quot;, which if you haven't heard, you need to get a hold of it.<BR>Amsterdam(9/10)- The lyrics are the star of this song. If any track off &quot;Rush&quot; could pass for &quot;Parachutes&quot;, it would be this one. Very mellow and slow, still beautiful.
0486278077|5.0|Oscar Wilde was shunned by the public after publishing The Picture of Dorian Gray. It is a beautifully written book and is as much a work of art as an elegantly painted portrait.<br />Centered around the vain and young Dorian Gray, it tells the price one pays for eternal youth and gives a new dimension to the human soul. As Dorian succumbs to the tempting dark underworld of London, and he lives by night in wicked ways, the beautiful portrait painted of him becomes like a journal of his soul, becoming ever more twisted and deformed. It begins to haunt Dorian continuously, day and night, consuming his every thought. Then a shadow from his young past creeps back into his life and makes Dorian's life even more frightening<br />Oscar Wilde's novel is a magnificent read and explores the issue and thoughts surrounding man's soul. How tarnished it becomes if we live a bad life, etcetera.<br />I recommended anyone to read this Wilde masterpiece. You do not have to like horror to enjoy it. Any lover of a well written book would also fall for this.
B00005RHGK|5.0|Jeepers Creepers is a throwback to the slasher films of the 80s,without it being a slasher film.Director Victor Salva(Powder)I believe brought us a different kind of horror picture,one that doesn't really relie on gore that much but on imagies.The movie starts out with siblings Darry (Justin Long) and Trish (Gina Philips)are driving home for spring break and are nearly run off the road by a manic in a old beat-up truck with the coolest lisecne plate B-EATNG-U and later on to find him shoving/throwing what looks like a body down a sewer pipe at an old church.After the driver of the truck tries to run them off the road again,Darry and Trish decide to go back to the church to see if anyone needs help,what they discover at the bottom of the pipe is far worse then they could have ever imagined and now the creeper as his sights set on the siblings.The design of the creeper(played by Jonathan Breck)is a really neat,new and fresh look to see.There are alot of twisted scenes like the tounge scene for example.I had a total blast watching Jeepers Creepers in the theater,I love the thrill of being scared and this was one of the most stylish horror films I've seen in a long time.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I'll admit I was skeptical when I first heard of a Chris Cornell/Rage Against the Machine collaboration, but from the minute I first listened to Audioslave's debut album, I was unbelieveably hooked.  Opening song (and hit single) &quot;Cochise&quot; is a pure rock out song that shows the blending of Cornell's lyrics with Rage's rhythm section.  &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot; bears resemblance to late Soundgarden going from a heavy melody to a more mellow and back again, while &quot;Gasoline&quot; bears so much resemblance to Soundgarden's &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; that it's almost scary.  &quot;Like A Stone&quot; is absolutely one of the finest and saddest songs that I have ever heard (I was raving about it before it ever became a hit single) and it is so catchy that you won't be able to not love it from the minute you hear it.  Other songs like &quot;I Am the Highway&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Sun&quot;, &quot;Exploder&quot;, and &quot;The Last Remaining Light&quot; are all great songs, in fact the only song I wasn't too fond of was &quot;Set It Off&quot;, but that doesn't take anything away from this album.  Cornell's voice has never sounded better, and the way his vocals blend with the music of Tom Morello, Tim Commorford, and Brad Wilk is surprisingly great.  The only problems I have with Audioslave is that when it's over it leaves you wanting so much more, and sometimes Cornell's lyrics can sound preachy (like they did on his solo outing &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot;), but as I said before, none of that can take away from how great this album is.  All in all, if your craving something meaningful and heavy from talented musicians, then give Audioslave a much needed look.
0920668372|4.0|My kids (now 3 and 5)loved this book.  I laughed out loud when I read a review saying this book was strange and creepy. (The mother driving across town in the middle of the night with a ladder tied to her car has to be the creepiest part).  After I first read this book, those were my sentiments exactly. However, this book is written for children and through the eyes of a child, it shows the never-ending love a mother has for her son or daughter.  This book would be best purchased for kids 5 and under. After 6, I think they might think the mother in this book a bit odd.
B000089J0R|5.0|I've been a fan since thier demo ... Now, I think thier one of the best bands since Iron Maiden. You can't beat Sam and Herman's high speed guitar solos. If your into any type of metal, then you have got to get this cd. Do it now!!!...
B00006LSM3|5.0|I can't find the words to tell you how wonderful this CD is. No doubt, this shows just how talented George Harrison was. He left us with, I think the best yet. A very close to Cloud Nine in fact. I couldn't wait for this to come out. Really listen to is words in all his songs. What a sad thing that this had to be his last. As he could go on forever with his talent in writing and singing, and the way he plays that guitar. With his son Dahni, and Jeff Lynn, no wonder this is so good.
B00005JLD4|5.0|This movie is by far the most amazing film I've ever seen. I was completely stunned and shocked by its basis on a true story that happened within the last 100 years in what is considered a \\"civilized\\" country. There are amazing parallels between the events in both the US and Australia regarding their native peoples, and this film really brings that point home.<br />I actually cried during this movie, and when it was over my friend and I couldn't speak for a while due to the emotions that we were feeling. When we finally did speak, it was in hushed voices with reverence for the characters and their plight, and the knowledge that this was just one story of many children who suffered the under the same circumstances.<br />The reason I consider this to be a wonderful movie is for the emotions it invoked. It's not the type of movie that you'd call good for mind-numbing entertainment value, which is what usually passes for \\"good\\", but it was a wonderful movie for bringing you into its world and making you feel real emotions. I also like that it brought the knowledge of the \\"Stolen Generations\\" to a wider audience, an audience that might not have even known of the Australian policies towards their native peoples in the recent past.
B00006J9OT|5.0|One listen and it is clear why this great live recording won the Grammy for best Best Jazz Vocal recording!  Check out the new release &quot;Heartdrops&quot;, it features vocals and some great piano playing too by Diana Krall!
B000002J03|5.0|Everybody knows \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". But every song on this opus is a classic. Really worth a listen!
0609610570|5.0|I know men in the ranks who are going to stay in the ranks. Why? I'll tell you why. Simply because they haven't the ability to get things done*.  It's as simple as that. Reading the wonderful book, &quot;Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done&quot; by Larry Bossidy, et al, is a good first start --- a must. Then I, as one whose career (and salary) has rocketed, recommend that you do what I did and go on to read *Dale Carnegie's &quot;How to Win Friends...&quot;, and Norman Thomas Remick's &quot;West Point: Character Leadership Education...&quot;. As an adjunct to &quot;Execution&quot;, the Carnegie book gives great, easy-to-understand practical anecdotes, while the Remick book gives a great, easy-to-understand education on the philosophical values behind the former two books.
B00008DDXB|5.0|this movie surpasses the first one Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone, you see more of the actors/actresses and learn more about the school, etc. ITS JUST A A REALLY, GOOD, WICKED movie!!!
B0000640SA|5.0|If anyone says this movie falls short of a classic and then recommends Fight Club instead (a well done movie)...you may want to pay attention to some of the other reviews. This movie dropped jaws and changed the way many people perceive an acceptable storyline in the same way Hitchcock's The Rope changed the way films were shot. I'm not comparing Nolan to Hitchcock, it may take him a few lifetimes to get to that point (smirk). If you are a true movie fan and follow the works of such directors as David Lynch (and loved being confused by Twin Peaks), Hitchcock (and awed and one director's prolific perfection), etc. then by all means this movie should definitely be a part of your cinematic conversation. The storyline and it's backwards moving plot is by no means original. A few notable \\"classics\\" with stroylines that don't start at the beginning include Pulp Fiction and Magnolia, among others. A few of those very same elements appear in some black and white classics as well. However Christopher Nolan's treatment of the backwards moving storyline is unique (a man without the ability to make new memories versus a man with amnesia) and worth seeing for that reason alone. Very few directors would ever think to make an attempt at such a feat due to the obvious pitfalls of endeavouring to make the story coherent and seamless. If your understanding of what makes a movie truly great is limited to Guy Ritchie and David Fincher (both extremely talented directors, don't get me wrong, but not the only talented directors, not by a million mile long shot) then you probably aren't going to get much out of this movie. <br />And then there's the \\"fail safe device\\" for those who still don't get it after seeing it more than once...Just watch the movie backwards.
B00005QG9J|3.0|Incubus. I live for Incubus. But I do not understand how they have changed so much. I think Morning View is my least favorite Incubus CD. It seems like they changed every time. I enjoy S.C.I.E.N.C.E and Enjoy Incubus MUCH more than this \\"Wish You Were Here\\" [stuff]. Incubus was so much better before. thats all i have to say.
1565847032|5.0|It's better to read Noam Chomsky than to read what other people think of him.<br />Some of his earliest political books take some effort to get through. But not this one. Ever since (roughly) the 1980s, Chomsky has made his political research more accessible --- shorter books, books full of interviews, etc. This approach reaches its climax with Understanding Power. It's all here, presented in a way that anyone can read. If you want footnotes, they are easy to find online. (And there's a *lot* of them. They constitute a whole other book unto themselves.)<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a view of US foreign policy and political history that is accurate and respectful of basic human rights
B00008DDXC|5.0|I am a junior in high school, but I love the Harry Potter series.  This movie is the best Harry Potter movie yet.  This movie is darker than the first movie, however, it is still very good.  Ginny Weasly is featured very predominately in this film.  Also Tom Riddle's character is portrayed very well.  The actress that plays Ginny is a very good actress.  Daniel Radcliffe does a very very excellant job.  Rupirt Grint and Emma Watson also do a very excellant job as well.  This movie was so good, I can't wait until 2004 when the next movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, comes out in the theaters.  Good job Daniel, Rupirt, and Emma, great movie.  The same of all of the other characters: Percy, Fred George, Oliver, Draco, Richard Harris (Proffessor Dumbledore), Proffessor McGonnagal, Crabbe, and Goyle, Proffessor Snape, and Hagrid.  Once again, Great Movie, I would totally recomend buying the movie.
B000002HEP|5.0|Absolutely incredible and unique fro the first moment...the way the drums pile up behind the groove in Gardenia sounding like a missle building up to launch...the way Asteroid just gets faster and faster...Supa Scoopa's false stops...100 degress display of sheer power...the insanity that ensues towards the end of Space Cadet...the twin solos to end Demon Cleaner...Odyssey's trance inducing psychedelia...Conan Troutmann's steady thump...the fantastic leads in N.O....and finally, the entire beast that is Whitewater...the incredible intertwining of musical virtuosity and a solid songcraft...
B00005JKZ3|1.0|rather than a sequel. [Weak] plot, horrible acting and dialogue (this is supposed to be a comedy?) warmed over costume and set designs. Movie is also very short (thankfully)- Barry Sonnenfeld obviously has no talent and has ruined what should have been a slam dunk sequel.
B00005LC1H|5.0|&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; is a brilliant sitcom created by Monty Python funnyman John Cleese, centering around a most unusual hotel in the British seaside town of Torquay. It's also one of those British shows which American TV has often attempted to copy, with no success whatsoever. <br />Based on a real-life hotel manager whom he once met while filming &quot;Monty Python's Flying Circus,&quot; Cleese's Basil Fawlty is the manic owner of Fawlty Towers, a chaotic English hotel. His view of the job, one applauded by customer-service workers the world over, is that everything would run perfectly well if it weren't for the actual customers mucking everything up. Along with his shrewish wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), inept Spanish waiter Manuel (the very non-Spanish Andrew Sachs) and sensible waitress Polly (co-writer Connie Booth, to whom Cleese was married when the show first appeared), the deranged Basil just barely manages to keep Fawlty Towers operating.<br />The show ran for only twelve episodes, and thus dodges the bullet which has felled so many good series -- they stay on the air long after passing their creative peak. While the plots may seem somewhat conventional by American standards (incompetent builders, weird guests, health inspectors, and so on), the show has not aged a day thanks to its timeless topics.<br />As with most good British shows, American TV has made several attempts to copy &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; for a stateside audience, and has failed miserably each time. &quot;Amanda's,&quot; starring Beatrice Arthur, lasted just eight episodes in 1983, while another four were filmed but never aired. John Larroquette had his turn aping Basil in 1999's &quot;Payne,&quot; which also lasted eight episodes before the plug was pulled. Neither show even came close to the manic genius of the original.<br />So please don't try copying &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; again. It's been tried, and it just can't be done.
B00001IVOF|4.0|Mobb Deep's \\"The Infamous\\" is a classic album with unrelenting, hard hitting, and eerily dark flows and beats. To think they would go ahead and make their next album \\"Hell On Earth\\" even more dark and nightmarish is absurd. . .BUT THEY DID. I can't mention one track on this album that lacks a chilling beat with violent lyrics by Prodigy and Havoc. The \\"Hell on Earth\\" title suits this album very well indeed. Even when these emcees flow subject matter that has nothing to do with violence (which is rare), it still sounds dark with the tone of voice they both project. ...Buy this if you wanna hear a truly sick LP. <br />(IF I COULD GIVE 4.5 Stars for it I would. . . that would be a more accurate rating).<BR>Peace
B000060P79|5.0|Now for my opinion on the cd I LOVE IT. And I don't care what anyone thinks. BUY IT NOW!
B000002JPA|4.0|This is NOT Dream Theater's best album.  I rely on the Prog People of the universe for some reasoning and understanding when there are endless seas of the Teeny Bopper People to be content on the surface.  But I guess even in the most intuitive minds, nostalgia is a big force and I'm not old enough to understand it yet.  That said, allow an &quot;outsider&quot; to point something out: &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; &quot;Appetite for Destruction,&quot; and &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; were and are all phenomenal albums, but joining the ranks is &quot;Images and Words,&quot; in that earlier isn't always better.  In the non-mainstream world of DT, &quot;Images and Words&quot; was their &quot;Breakthrough,&quot; just as &quot;Appetite...&quot; was, in the mainstream for GNR.  Great albums like this one deserve praise and timelessness, that's a given for me, but I don't think one must have to be that openminded to see that breakthrough albums are what they are; HUGE openings of gates or windows or pick your own metaphor(s) that begin the hopeful path to evolution and progress.<BR>      So I've explained why I felt the need to take away a star, but now let's go to work and justify the presence of the other 4.<BR>First off, if it weren't for an AMAZING track called &quot;Metropolis 1&quot;, the fate of DT's BEST album and quasi-sequel to it (that should be enough hinting) later down the road might not have been the same.  With such jawdrapping rhythmic motives and glorious intrumental breaks, all stampeding up towards the last crashing climax, there's really no words I can think of to describe it. <BR>      &quot;Take the Time&quot; is very complex (what isn't here) but the instrumental melody and jam progression (E-F#-A-C-D-E) towards the end is the embryo of what the Theater would be striving for over the next decade - GROOVE AND FEEL! There's more in the later albums, but most of &quot;Take the Time&quot; reveals John Petrucci's Godlike ability to play the most technically proficient passages WHILE maintaining emotion.<BR>     &quot;Another Day&quot; is one of my favorites as it is slower and thus these manmachines of prog let their brains calm down a bit.  Result: taste.  James has some very poignant vocals as well.<BR>      And of course the star of the show, &quot;Pull Me Under.&quot; Which to this day doesn't make sense to me why that song seemed to grab the prog market that it did.  It IS a good song... but that song is one of the least prog songs they have, which is probably why, coupled with many edits, they were able to get it on MTV a little bit.  Still I've heard many say they've never heard anything like &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; at the time, and it sounds very Megadeth/Metallica to me, almost Pantera!.  Which isn't a bad thing, let me add. Indeed, though &quot;Images and Words&quot; IS a great album and it has more &quot;up&quot; moments than &quot;down&quot; moments, it isn't as original and creative as 1) everyone gives it credit for and 2) Dream Theater would soon become.  The triggering and processing on the snare puts a bit of a dated sound to the experience as well, I might add.  But nobody in their right mind can listen to this album and knock them down for a lack of effort.<BR>    I advise purchasing their entire catalog, as every album has its own character to offer, but it is always Dream Theater.  That's what's so great about this band.  Well, the fact that their playing can blow anyone else who comes within 50 feet of a guitar off of the planet doesn't hurt either.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|&quot;The Hours&quot; is a compelling drama involving the lives of three women in three cities in three decades and are somehow connected to the novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot;  Throughout this universally acclaimed movie, we are guided through a myriad of themes including depression, suicide, child abandonment, AIDS, broken relationships, and physical illness.  Hardly a feel good movie of the Disney variety, but it's a wonderful adaptation of the Michael Cunningham book that excels on the strength of its award-calibre performances.  Now, I don't profess to be a guru of classical music, nor do I pretend to be terribly familiar with the work of Philip Glass.  But I do know an excellent score when I hear one, and &quot;The Hours&quot; is such a score.  The music is as much a character as the other cast members, and it adds emotional impact and depth to the film's more powerful scenes.  &quot;Morning Passages&quot; is a beautifully composed piano number, while &quot;For Your Own Benefit&quot; and &quot;The Poet Acts&quot; are also strikingly good.  You don't necessarily need to see &quot;The Hours&quot; to appreciate this CD (though it would certainly help), but this is one of the most elegant pieces of instrumental music I've heard in a while.  It won an Academy Award nomination for Best Score, and it's very easy to see why.
0876855575|5.0|Ham on Rye is a cult classic - and for good reason.  It's the book your English teacher(and your parents) didn't want you to read in high school.  At times, it is debaucherous and raunchy, but then again so is growing up.  That's what makes this book so great - Bukowski's impressive and unique ability to tell it like it really happened - with no sugar-coating or glossing over the dirty stuff.  Some people say this is comparable to Catcher in the Rye as a rite of passage type book.  I say this is much, much better than Salinger's book - no doubt.  While both have a devoted fan following, Ham on Rye is unique in the sense that it is much more plausible and much more fun.  I not only empathized with Henry and his trying travails and tribulations, I felt like I was there with him - looking at the teacher's legs, getting beat by his Dad, getting drunk with his friends, etc.<br />While this book is not politically correct by any stretch of the imagination and, thus, not for everybody, I unequivocally feel that this is a must read for those of us who are not constrained by limits and boundaries placed upon us by others.  Hence, if you have the gonads, give this one a look-see.<br />&quot;Children should be seen and not heard.&quot; - Henry's Father
B00005JM1D|4.0|The headline really sums it up.  The movie is mindless, low on plot (and what there is makes no sense) and derivative (Animal House redux).  For all that, it was great.  A wonderful variation on a familiar theme.  A great way to waste an evening!
B000002UKS|5.0|This is like the best album out of any one I own or have ever owned. It has such a unique sound to it. I can tell that the Foo Fighters have great talent from listening to it. They have definitely spent a great deal of time and effort on this one. It has huge hits like Monkey Wrench, My Hero, and Everlong on it,plus every song has a unique sound to it.<br />This also is probably one of the most unique sounding albums I have ever listened to. My fave tracks other than the hits are Hey Johnny Park, Wind Up, My Poor Brain and Enough Space. The Foo Fighters sound great, have lots of talent and never disappoint me when they come out with new albums. All the Foo's albums are great, but this one just tops them all. Foo Fighters you guys rule and anyone who likes excellent alternative rock music should definitely try this one out. OH YEAH!!!

B00005UEAR|2.0|This double CD is a major disappointment. I don't know why, but I do tend to agree with some of the reviewers who said that DT was trying to branch out and go mainstream. I don't see anything on this album going into the radio charts. ... There are some highlights on this however... disc 1 isn't all bad... it's actually pretty good. \\"Glass Prison\\" is a cool song with great musicianship and a kind of Metallica or new Megadeth feel. \\"Blind Faith\\" is the most typical Dream Theater sounding track on the album so it's also quite good as well. Next comes \\"Misunderstood\\" which is also pretty well written and a more sombre sounding effort, followed by \\"The Great Debate\\", a song about stem cell research with a definite Tool sound ... All in all the first CD isn't bad. ...

B0000025DV|4.0|OUT OF THE BLUE has its place in my ELO collection near the top.  This is the album that ELO peaked at with platinum sales primarily due to FACE THE MUSIC, A NEW WORLD RECORD, and the incredible live show, but the album has it's great moments in soft rock, but seriously lacks rockers which JEFF I think had the knack for And a question comes into my mind also, does the album have a bit of a story to it????  I don't know if JEFF attempted it, but if you think about it, it sure does.  TURN TO STONE is a kinda rocker which was a hit and speaks about how his woman is gone, and turns to stone (drinking).  IT'S OVER starts the softer songs and has great verses and a better chorus.  SWEET TALKIN' WOMAN is another kind of rocker and is one of the peak tracks of the album and is a pleasure, if not a guilty one to listen to.  ACROSS THE BORDER is a spanish inspired rocker and is one of my favorites to listen to.  The album now runs into trouble with a few songs that people wouldn't like.  NIGHT IN THE CITY, is a bit of a duff track, but has a moment in the opening when I first heard it, which is the guitar opening, but turned out to be a little bit of a scrapper.  STARLIGHT was a jazz attempt?  A little daft and kind of a duff, but I listen to it.  JUNGLE is an attempted rocker, a bit silly, but a nice tune.  BELIEVE ME NOW is definately not a weak track, in fact a memorable one in my opinion, one that you play to think about tough moments.  STEPPIN' OUT, a so-so track, but below par by ELO standards.  STANDING IN THE RAIN is a good tune in this part of the album which is an ever changing song with no real rythem or chorus.  Now is when the album turns memorable starting with the beautiful chorus of BIG WHEELS that is worth waiting 2 minutes for.  SUMMER AND LIGHTNING is another strong and beautiful track with a strong chorus,  MR. BLUE SKY clears up all the rain and lightning and is a happy tune, with I'd say, the happiest guitar solo of all time.  The song ending is quite nice with the choir.  The blue sky ends and SWEET IS THE NIGHT, a guilty pleasure to listen to, beautiful.  THE WHALE, is a synth driven instrumental that isn't weak, but a good song.  BIRMINGHAM BLUES does well, an attempted bluesy song, a good tune though.  WILD WEST HERO finishes it off not rockin' or soft rock, but was a hit somehow.  I'm not saying it's a bad song, I like it, but it's not really rock...........I don't know.  OUT OF THE BLUE has a certain structure and each song compliments the next in pure music of it and in the song name (SUMMER AND LIGHTNING to MR. BLUE SKY to SWEET IS THE NIGHT)  a time bar somehow.  Good album, but not ELO's best, but it is the best selling.
0380018179|5.0|The Thorn Birds is an epic saga about the family of Paddy and Fee Cleary, and their children, especially Meggie, the only girl.  Paddy is a working class sheep shearer, but his wife Fee seems mysteriously aristocratic.  The story opens in 1915, in rural New Zealand on Meggie's fourth birthday.  Writing about the next two years in the life of the Cleary's, the author introduces us to the personalities, family relationships and struggles of Paddy, Fee and their first four children.<br />The story resumes in 1921 when Meggie is ten years old.  The Cleary's move to Drogheda in New South Wales, Australia.  Drogheda, in the Outback some 610 miles West of Sydney, is a vast sheep farm owned by Mary Carson, Paddy's long lost sister.  Mary Carson is immensely wealthy, shrewd, treacherous and weary of living.  Since Mary has no other living relatives, she invited Paddy to run Drogheda during her final years.  In return, he would inherit the bulk of her vast estate...well that's what she told Paddy.<br />Mary Carson has an interesting relationship with a twenty-eight year old, ambitious, handsome Catholic Priest, father Ralph de Bricassart.  Having enticed father Ralph with generous contributions to the church, Mary claws into his psyche to play mind-games, and conceives a twist that will set the story soaring.  The central intrigue, however, is going to be the relationship between Meggie and Father Ralph during the next 48 years.<br />This is a brilliantly crafted tale that draws the reader into life in the Australian outback where it took six weeks for the mail wagon to complete its rounds.  It also pokes a hard-nose into the workings of the Catholic Church and the trauma of celibacy.  The descriptions of Drogheda as it changes during the seasons and over the wet-drought cycle are a bit tedious at times, but otherwise the pace moves along with vivid and believable characters.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|O.K. so it's not psychdelic in the way that one usually thinks about psychdelic music but this is a great collection of music.  It includes all of the standards, but it also includes so many songs that you didn't realize that you DO know (a very, very pleasant surprise for me).  I highly recommended it!
B0000025KI|5.0|This is music with such  depth and power that it gives you so many different emotions. You can feel fun and rocking with Hungry Heart and The Ties That Bind, emotionally scarred with The River and Point Blank, or you can feel very strange with Stolen Car. This is the album that uses romance and rock and roll powerfully with honest lyrics such as, /But I remember us riding in my brother's car/her body tan and wet down at the resovair/ The most amazing romance album ever
B00006690G|5.0|If there was ever a doubt of eminem having a skill like no other rapper then the doubt will soon be cleared. Eminem shows amazing talent in the songs: 'till i collapse; when the music stops; hailie's song; and white america. Eminem has the stunning ability to tell of the prejudice of people around us through his songs. This message he gets across is preformed with a such ability it is easy to just get lost in his words and feel as if the words were writen especially for you. Eminem is not like other rappers; not because he is white, but because how he raps draws people to his music. His words are pronounced so clearly that understanding what he said comes easy to everyone. Em's accent makes his words stronger and brings a stronger effective. The Eminem Show is a great album and is unforgetable. Eminem has deffenately proved his talent through this CD.
B000002HRE|5.0|This is a great album, one of my favorites after s&m, black and kill 'em all, it is very similar to load but with much better songs.<BR>-Fuel- Fast, fast and fast. Gets you crazy. The best track of the CD 5/5<BR>-Memory remains- I used to hate it, but i listened to it and i realized its great 4.5/5<BR>-Devil's dance- Great guitars 4/5<BR>-Unforgiven II- One of the bests. Good second part of the classical Unforgiven 5/5<BR>-Better than you- This one is good, they should have made a video of this one 4.5/5<br />-Slither- I didn't like this until i heard the chorus. Good one 4/5<BR>-Carpe Diem Baby- Live the day the best you can listening to this song 5/5<BR>-Bad seed- This is the worst song of the cd.

B000002MY3|5.0|There's a tendency to pigeon-hole Alanis Morissette as angst-ridden and dismiss her as merely the instigator of a whole host of other Alanis-wannabes.  Whilst at least some of this may be true, Jagged Little Pill stands as one of the most important and influential female singer/songwriter albums of the 90's (and the second biggest selling of all time, next to Shania Twain's country crossover Come On Over).  Okay, so many of the tracks here are angsty, but surely this is something everyone can relate to.  ....<br />All of the singles are instantly recognisable - You Oughta Know, You Learn, Ironic, Hand In My Pocket, All I Really Want, Head Over Feet - although in fairness the more popular ones may start to grate a little after the repeated radio play they receive.  But this certainly doesn't take away from their universality and the fact that these are very good songs.  The lyrics are so nakedly personal that many have questioned who the subject of songs such as You Oughta Know are about.  Alanis' vocals work for her as well; angry and full of emotion, it ensures you listen to the lyrics as well as the catchy hooks that the album is laden with.  Unfortunately it's this very aspect which seems to have worked against Alanis retrospectively, as many people have taken her up as the goddess of alternative female rock/pop.  This particular tagline is especially infuriating given the fact that this is an intelligent, well-written album and this seems to have been obscured by the hyperbolic praise of Alanis as a feminist.  This certainly isn't true.  Although there are plenty of great angry tracks - Right Through You could easily have been a single, ranking alongside the best of her whole career - the perhaps surprising tenderness of tracks such as Head Over Feet and You Learn show Alanis to be anything but a raving feminist.  Indeed, the bonus track Shower is the kind of stripped-down song that epitomises the feel of the whole album.  Intensely personal yet somehow universal, angry yet tender, Jagged Little Pill sometimes seems to flow like a stream of consciousness, something that listeners should revel in.  It hasn't been topped by Alanis' subsequent albums either, which makes this album stand out all the more somehow as one of the classic rock/pop albums of the last 10 years.
0380973464|5.0|I admit to being a Neal Stephenson fan, so I went into this book expecting a good read.  What I got was a great read!<br />I started my Neal Stephenson reading with Snow Crash as I think many people did.  It is a \\"cyber punk\\" novel which I found to be almost prophetic considering it was written before the Internet had become mainstream.  I was expecting something along these lines but this book was very different.<br />It was a masterfully woven tale that moves back and forth between characters in WWII and their grandchildren in present day business.  The parallel's it draws between today's data security and WWII's encryption and information warfare are great.<br />Stephenson fans will not be disappointed when it comes to computer/math aspects of this book.  It will teach you a little soemthing about the invention of the computer (Alan Turing in a character) and cryptography.  The movement between present day and WWII is done brilliantly and I never felt as if the book was disjointed because of it.<br />It is a big book, but when it is over you will wish it was longer.  Don't be suprised if when you are done you want to know more about cryptography.  I had to go out and purchase The Code Book afterward to learn more, which was also a good book by the way.

6300274195|2.0|I was so excited to rent this video and watch it with my son. I didn't remember it being so racist. I was incredibly saddened as we sat through it, hoping that my son wouldn't pick up on all the slurs against people of color. I agree with many other reviewers that this movie is a classic, it is just a shame that it was socially acceptable to make this kind of statement at that point in time.
B0000636UN|3.0|Permeated with hooky riffs and instantly familiar melodies, C'Mon C'Mon rocks just as hard as it aims to please Adult-Contemporary radio.<br /><br />Atypically, Crow penned much her forth studio effort alone. As a result, though sonically more gestalt then her cowritten work, too many songs wound up derailed by lyrics that just don't click. Opener \\"Steve McQueen\\" is a keeper, as is the Lenny Kravitz guest turn on \\"You're An Original\\" and the Steve Nicks harmony on \\"C'mon C'mon.\\" However, howler \\"Safe and Sound\\" and dull \\"Diamond Road\\" lead the pack of less impressive tunes on the disc.<br /><br />More awake than Globe Sessions but not as crafty (or as funky) as her self-titled disc, this release finds successes in its rockers - a few of which admirably echo rock classics while adding their own distinctive twist. Bottom line: If you can wince through a few abysmal turns of phrase, you might wind up really liking this record.
B000055Y0X|5.0|As previous reviews have aptly noted, it is difficult to review Dr. Strangelove simply because its merits are so readily apparent upon viewing.  Filmed in the mid-1960s in eeriely-fitting black and white, this is a film that cannot be fully appreciated without reference to the nuclear paranoia and deep-freeze of the Cold War at that time.  The film delights in, in equal turns, setting up and then ridiculing all the posturing and assumptions of the age.  Others have attempted to generate farce out of the idea of \\"gap\\" fear (the Ruskies might have a 10 megaton warhead strapped to a donkey, we have a donkey gap) or MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction results in a military paralysis on both sides that is the operational equivalent of real peace), but Dr. Strangelove remains the finest.  The film is a beautiful and both grim/hilarious time capsule from a period where the outcome of the Cold War looked very much like it was going to be fallout (Cuban missile crisis, kruschev's \\"We will bury you\\").  While the effectiveness of those plans of matching the Soviet's every move and putting a nuclear ICBM in every silo may or may not have worked in ending the Cold War, it may just as easily have been calming down enough to stop pointing everything at one another.  Dr. Strangelove heckles them all, depicting a series of events, instigated by an insane U.S. base commander, that spiral rapidly out of control despite everyone's comical efforts at controlling them.  From Colonel Mandrake's discovery of a small transistor radio bleating out the most inane 60s pseudo-jazz elevator music (intentionally chosen, I am sure) to indicate that the U.S. is not actually under attack, to the President's hilariously colloquial conversations with the drunken Soviet Prime Minister (\\"Of course I like you! ..Don't say that, Dimitri\\") to knobby-jawed Buck Turgidson's constant fears of a post-apocalyptic \\"mine space gap\\" that might allow the Soviets to, after mutual 90 year periods underground, return to the surface with more people and take over, every aspect of the cold war nuclear arms race is held up to ridicule.<br />The titular character, Dr. Strangelove, a wheel-chair bound German scientist now employed by the Americans, serves as a metaphor for war, a sort of personified doomsday clock.  The closer the countries get to war, the healthier and more robust he seems to become, despite repeated attempts by his metallic right arm to strangle him.  Dr. Strangelove, in the course of his wise counseling of the President in this time of crisis, reveals he actually carries a radioactive half-life materials guide, accidentally adopts a Nazi salute, and shouts \\"Mein Fuhrer!  I can walk!\\" as the bombs finally start to fall.  His most damning commentary, however, comes in the form of his explanation of how the U.S. might perserve a nucleus of society underground to rebuild after the explosions, explaining with a knowing leer that of course the political honchos must be saved to govern society and, naturally, many buxom and fertile women of high attractiveness must be brought down as well in a ratio of, oh, 10 to 1.  This is entertainingly similar to U.S. government plans that arose back then and are still in effect that, in the event of nuclear attack, all high ranking members of the government, including all of Congress and the Senate, and their families, must be whisked away to protective bunkers while the country they represent gets blasted to pieces.  Not too hard to figure out who passed the laws for that, eh?  Alluring if you're the one heading into the bunker filled with supermodels, not so much fun if you're not.  And with both countries following that procedure, the only ones to survive would, obviously, be those that caused it and that would simply fall back into their respective postures again afterwards.  As a side note, a telling sign of Dr. Strangelove's continuing relevance is the amazing number of references to it found in The Simpsons, which you will recognize easily.cognize easily.
B00004XONN|3.0|Atmospheric. Detached.<br />Half the time i'm not sure why a rock band would ever even want to make some of these sounds, let alone how.<br />Spacious. Bleak.<br />I hated this record when it was released, and went on hating it for the better part of a year. It simply isn't a rock record, and there wasn't a reason for everyone to get so excited about so many blips and processed vocals.<br />Precise. Assured.<br />The more i heard Kid A, the more i began to realize that everything on it was being done intentionally. It was orchestrated, but players in the orchestra were replaced with a recluse rock band and their endless banks of processors. Not such a bad thing, really.<br />Mysterious. Mythological.<br />Thom and the boys are saying things that i don't think i get the point of. In fact, i didn't get the point of this album until i bought Amnesiac. Falling into the strange times and places of that disc, i realized that it was no different from Kid A other than that it offered no context for its songs; they exist separately from each other.<br />Geshtalt. Unified.<br />Kid A is not an album you can make mix-tapes from, with the possible exceptions of &quot;Optimistic&quot; and &quot;Idioteque.&quot; As a result, these two might seem as though they're the sole highlights when you first hear them. Listening to Kid A in a coffee shop is all but useless. Hunkering down with a pair of good headphones might not produce any results. Getting stoned might not help.<br />The only thing i can say, especially as a previous despiser of this piece of work, is that you must give this entire disc a chance. Do not think of it as a cycle of single songs. Think of it as a complete fifty minute submersion into a sonic world this is distinctly different from the one you might have been expecting.<br />Challenging. Different. Don't expect to like it. Entertain the possibility of being surprised.
B000089RVX|1.0|As if there was any other doubt remaining that the music coming out of the major labels is processed rather than performed, this year's Avril Lavigne has hit the table. The Linkin Park album is actually better than something. <br />Amy Lee is a gifted vocalist that occasionally sings good lyrics. The band doesn't get off so lucky; they don't even occasionally play good riffs.  Still, they seem competent enough, even as the songs offer no real challenge.  That fell entirely on the producer. <br />And sonically, this album excels, not that this should be a surprise in today's corporate rock.  They'd like to be compared to Lacuna Coil, but they sound like Linkin Park fronted by Tori Amos, which is a disservice to the vocal talents Lee does actually possess. Every song is a composite of several popular styles of the most recent number one hits.  The song &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; is just one example of this.  There are 10 others.  &quot;Whisper&quot; actually sounded like it could have been a good song for the first 30 seconds, and &quot;My Immortal&quot; almost is.  There's a lot of &quot;almost&quot; here because the songs are half-written. But you can sell a lot of soft drinks with this stuff.<br />As their name implies, Evanescence is really only going to be around long enough to for suits to cash in on something they can pretend is new.  This is easily the most cynical attempt to get money I have seen a company make since Windows Millenium Edition. They'll get away with it because people have been spoon-fed for so long, this actually seems &quot;refreshing&quot;.  <br />I gave it one star for production, and for the potential of Amy Lee's vocal skills, which were all but totally unrealized here.
B000002LLC|3.0|The Immaculate Collection seems like the perfect album to follow Like A Prayer; a non-stop assault of carefully pruned Madonna hits to follow up her most personal and well-produced album so far. What most people forget is that I'm Breathless was the true successor to Prayer. The disc is a soundtrack of music from and inspired by the Warren Beatty film Dick Tracy, but all of its performances are primarily by Madonna. And, it's quite good.<br />As a soundtrack, the centerpieces of the disc are three jazzy Stephen Sondheim penned tracks, which Mad performs to a tee. Of the three, the sexy \\"Sooner Or Later\\" is more recognizable, but the beautiful duet with Mandy Patinkin on \\"What Can You Lose\\" and the hilariously greedy mince of \\"More\\" are both better. Madonna answers back with three of her own vaguely period pieces, starting with opener \\"He's A Man\\" -- an explosive big-band vamp written, shockingly, by Madonna herself (along with collaborator Patrick Leonard). Similarly, \\"Something To Remember\\" is excellent (and went on to title her future ballad collection), while the upbeat \\"Back In Business\\" could have seamlessly fit into the film.<br />The rest of the album vaguely missteps, both on the pair of tracks written by random collaborators (\\"I'm Going Bananas\\" and \\"Now I'm Following You\\") and with \\"Hank Panky\\" ... an absolutely bizarre ode to spanking set to a \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\" arrangement. Ironically, this was one of the clearest signals of what was to come on Madonna's next studio release Erotica. Similarly, the Betty Boop vocal impersonation on \\"Cry Baby\\" is cute, but doesn't warrant repeated listens.<br />Of course, after the ten soundtrack themed songs Madonna delivers her most indelible hit to-date with the sophisticated dancefloor smash \\"Vogue.\\" Rather than jive with the tone of the rest of the album, \\"Vogue\\" connects the more innocent (partially fabricated) age that it's set within to the freedom of being on the dancefloor. Oddly, it's a perfectly fitting close to this somewhat inconsistent album, and truly the best possible connection from Like A Prayer to The Immaculate Collection.ng close to this somewhat inconsistent album, and truly the best possible connection from Like A Prayer to The Immaculate Collection.
B00006690G|5.0|I love the new eminem cd. Any person can relate to almost every song on this cd. Whenever I get mad and need to calm down..I will go in my room and turn on that cd and listen to *Sing for the Moment* I can relate to that song so well and I think alot of other people can too. I dont really  like all of the skits on the cd but the songs are awesome. I would recommend this cd to any \\"mature\\" audiences.
B000002LND|2.0|Madonna had some great hits and a lot of them are on this album - but where are the original versions? If you had an ear permanently affixed to the radio in the 80's like I did, you will definitely feel dudded by the paltry offerings from her early 80's period. I am particularly alarmed by what suspiciously sounds like her voice being sped up. This is very noticeable on &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and &quot;Lucky Star&quot;. She sounds like a 5-year old for goodness sake! If you want the real versions it looks like you might just have to go out and buy the individual albums.

I really enjoyed this book because it taught us that even though growing up can be hard on a mother, she still shows her love to her son.  My mother used to read this book to me everynight, and when i am a mother, i will read it to my children.  My favorite thing about this book, however is that once that little boy grew up, he held and rocked his mother, just as she did to him.  I think its just a great, loving book.

B000003N7R|5.0|Duke Ellington made several very important musical meetings in the last twenty years of his life.He recorded in trio with Max Roach and Charles Mingus (\\"Money jungle\\",a summitt in the history of jazz piano),with Coleman Hawkins (on Impulse),with Louis Armstrong (on Reprise,a magnificent album every jazz lover should own), and with Trane.<BR>The day was September 26,1962.Duke was 63,Trane 36.Five of the tunes were written by Duke,one by Billy Strayhorn (\\"my little brown book\\"),and one by Trane (\\"Big Nick\\",referring to tenor sax player Big Nick Nicholas).Two different rhythm sections are used here: Trane's Jimmy Garrison,b,and Elvin Jones,dms, or Duke's Aaron Bell,b,and Sam Woodyard,dms.<BR>I had the opportunity of talking about this session with Sam Woodyard,some 16 or 18 years ago;and at the same time,he was pleased with the session,and disliked it.Pleased,because he loved to hear Duke playing in a small group contest;pleased,because even if he was a little bit afraid of Trane's music,he discovered an immense musician and enjoyed the session;but he disliked it,because he wasn't happy with the drums he had to play.He thought the drums' sound was too heavy.Indeed,he does very fine job here.Remember that Sam Woodyard (1925-1988) happened to be one of the most terrific big band drummers;in this kind of drumming,he's the next one after Jo Jones.And surely,he's among jazz'first ten drummers.Just listen to \\"Stevie\\" : Sam's very swinging,and implacable drumming will make you tap your feet .What he plays may seem very simple and easy,but here is the essence of jazz drumming. THE BEAT.His use of rim shots is outstanding.His use of the high hat is,to me,as great as Jo Jones'.What a reference !!!<BR>Now, about Duke: here is a rather rare opportunity to listen to his piano playing.One of the greatest of all times.If you own some of his records,like \\"piano reflections\\",\\"money jungle\\",\\"piano in the foreground\\",then you know what I mean.<BR>About Trane: magnificent.\\"In a sentimental mood\\" is an incredible masterpiece,at the same level than Lucky Thompson's version of this theme (\\"Lucky strikes\\",Prestige Records).Strayhorn's \\"little brown book\\" can make you think of Tadd Dameron's \\"soultrane\\".Why not? Tadd may be the greatest writer after Duke(I know,Strayhorn wrote it,but he devoted his own short life to Duke's music,and was so close to Ellington that it is barely impossible to make a difference between their writings).<br />I think that every record by Duke is essential;I know he made a lot,during his more than fifty years long career.I also think that every record by Trane is essential.But here is the meeting of two monuments of jazz,two of the most revered players of all times,and the result flirts with the highest level of music.

The images and sounds of this movie are truly outstanding. Enjoy.
B00005ATQD|4.0|If you want your stories all neatly wrapped and conventionally complete this is not the film for you, but if you enjoy stories with layers of meaning then this offering will stimulate thought and tease your immagination.  This is a film  that can be seen as a morality tale on the sanctity of marriage or you can take the approach that Kubrick's dreamy handling of the plot may be simply an overlay on reality, then the story comes vibrantly alive because this is a tale that could not be told without an XXX rating if Kubrick had shown us what was really on his mind.<br />Kubrick's last gift to us is a perplexing tale of the conflict between marital fidelity and the smorgasbord of casual sex.  The conflict begins with Alice's revelation that she has fantasized about giving herself sexually to a total stranger.  Is her admission just a fit of pique at Bill's flirtation with a threesome at the party, or is there a deeper darker secret that she wants to explore with him?  She gives every evidence that she would have liked to accept the charming stranger's proposition at the party. Half drunk she flirts madly with him, dances with utter seduction, and suspects that Bill is in some dalliance with two girls who have led him away. But at last she sardonically and tauntingly refuses the stranger's proposition because she is \\"married\\".  Bill on the other hand is saved from an indiscretion not by his own will but by an accident demanding his attention as a physician elsewhere.<br />That night Bill, haunted by images of wife in another man's arms, falls into a surreal odessey of sexual temptations but none are consummated because of interventions from others, not because he wanted to remain faithful to Alice, and curiously we are constantly perplexed by whether or not Alice has really been faithful to him.  We know from what she has told him that she is as attracted to casual sex as he is, her description of her \\"dream orgy\\" tallies so closely with the orgy at the mansion that we wonder if this is a confession that she has participated in the orgies herself.  Was she once behind one of those masks at the orgy, and is the mask that Bill wore to the orgy, (and that he now finds in bed with her) a confession that she has participated in the orgies herself?  Have they both been wearing masks to conceal their true natures from each other? And now that the masks are off will they be ever faithful to each other, or will they now indulge in Alice's last descriptive verb with their eyes wide open?  <br />What are we to make of that enigmatic opening shot of Kidman stepping out of her dress and kicking it angrily aside?  Was she just trying on different gowns for the evening ahead, had she just returned from a tryst with a lover (or an orgy), or was Kubrick simply priming us for her sensual self and the eroticism ahead?  In any case \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" (great title) takes its place with Lyne's \\"Lolita\\" and Malle's \\"Damage\\" as masterworks of sexual obsession, and we can be sure that Kubrick's choice of Cruise and Kidman was predicated on their marriage to each other. What other actors would be more perfectly suited to the exploration of this drama? How interesting that Kidman was so at ease with her role and Cruise so awkward with his. And how telling that their marriage collapsed after it was filmed.<br />If you find complexity compelling this is a DVD you will want to own because you will watch it again and again.  However you view it this film rates at least four stars even if Kubrick never finished it.
B00005RFVL|5.0|In the as-to-expected, infinite stupidity that embodies most record companies, this terrific record has never (and probably will never) be released in the States.<BR>With all the Rat Pack nostalgia going on, here we have a modern, ridiculously charismatic singer, known the world round, recording...in L.A. mind you...classics and standards simultaneously honoring Frank, Sammy and Dean while putting his own stamp on those same songs.<BR>The duet of &quot;Something Stupid&quot; with Nicole Kidman...you know, she's just a tad famous on THIS of the pond, you wise record company execs...is outstanding. I've played this for literally dozens of people, each and every one now a fan.<BR>The whole thing is an unadulterated joy to sit through.<BR>If you don't believe me, just ask the eighteen bazillion people in every other country in the world who made this #1 for months.<BR>It's just a shame he can't break big here.
B00006C7G9|5.0|When Richard Winter's grandson asked him if he was a hero in the war he said,\\" No, but I served with a company of heroes.\\"<BR>Richard Winters and his Band of Brothers was one of the best mini-series or tv shows ever. The Golden Globe winner deserves all the good reviews in the world. This epic portays the envolement of the 506th Divison and the 101st Airbourne in World War II. Within the 101st it focuses on Easy Co. From D-Day to Operation Market-Garden, to taking of the Eagle's Nest I enjoyed every last minute of this series. The acting and directing of this series was amazing. The 5-time Emmy Winner Band of Brothers, had great acting by Damian Lewis (Maj. Richard Winters), Ron Livingston (Capt. Lewis Nixon), Frank John Hughes (Staff Sgt. Bill Guarnere), David Schwimmer (Capt. Herbert Sobel), and Donnie Wahlberg (2nd Lt. Carwood Lipton), just to name a few. Directing by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg was amazing as usual. The special affects in this movie were great. From  Bastonge to Berlin it looked like I was in the war. If you listen to storys of what happened you would know that the BOB was accurate to the minute. This series gave me more of a understanding about what people went through during the greastest war of all time. The 10-part Band of Brothers is truly a national treasure, and again one of the best shows I have ever seen. Always remember there motto, \\"CURRAHEE!\\"
B00006HBUB|2.0|I had Scooby Doo cartoons as a child, the first time around that the series was aired. Loved my saturday mornings. The ONLY thing this movie has going for it is the first rate casting and performance of MATTHEW LILLARD as &quot;SHAGGY&quot;. That dude is &quot;SHAGGY&quot; from every physical characteristic all way down to the voice! Of course, the computer animated SCOOBY DOO is first rate &quot;actor&quot; as well. The girl who plays &quot;Thelma&quot; gives credibility to her character, but, realistically, &quot;Thelma&quot; was more akin to the 'Professor' on Gilligan's Island than a lost in love puppy-eyed romantic. Sarah Michelle Gellar &amp; Freddie Prinze Jr. seem just as miscast, as their characters are misrepresented from the originals. Most of those classic shows should be left as they were in entertainment history...most &quot;remakes&quot; lack the passion and spirit of the originals and are so shamelessly camped up to total silliness. As with Casper, The Brady Bunch,etc. - PLEASE leave them as they were, maybe a series of full length cartoon movie features are best on the SCOOBY DOO issue. This is like all those songs the Carpenters, Karen &amp; Richard, rerecorded and made their own during their heyday...and to this day, NOBODY has dared to go near, remake or touch those masterpieces. Nobody recalled the originals and they became better known as Carpenters hits. You can't mess with perfection: IT ONLY HAPPENS ONCE.
B000002UB3|5.0|...<br />My Favorite 2 Tracks are:<br />'Oh! Darling' - Pauls sings this quite well, and I like the emotion in the song. Paul was into recording 50's or earlier style songs and this is his best effort (see also 'Your Mother Should Know' and 'Honey Pie').<br />'Here Comes the Sun' - Great guitar on this song, which was written by the \\"Third Beatle\\" George Harrison. Great Beatles song even though John didn't play on it. Check out George's 'All Things Must Pass...' if you like this one.<br />The \\"Rock Opera\\" is great, though it was mostly Paul's creation. 'The End' was the symbolic end for The Beatles ('Let it Be' would be the last album released, while 'Abbey Road' was the last recorded, and 'I Me Mine' the last song recorded).<br />I don't think I can say anything more about this album that hasn't been said. The numbers tell the story, even for all the critics who don't like the album (and probably still bought it!). Also check out \\"Revolver\\", my second favorite Beatles album.
B000062TU1|3.0|I LOVE the Harry Potter series, there is almost NO book(s) like it.  I have already pre-ordered #5, and am crazy about the series.  When I heard that a Harry Potter movie was being made, I was, in a funny yet true word, HYSTERICAL!  I was so excited (I was 13 at the time).  Well, a year later, I went and saw the movie, and while it was a good movie no doubt, parts of it were just...stretched?  Heres what I thought of HP and the Sorcerer's Stone.<br />1) Plot: This movie follows (DUH!) the record selling book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling.  This movie, as promised, is FAITHFUL to the book.  And if thats all you were looking for, seeing the book for the most part brought to life page by page in a movie, then this movie was PERFECT for you!  I even enjoyed the movie because it was so faithful.  But while nearly every scene, literally, in the book made its way on to this film, a lot of it had NO insperation whatsoever.  For example, when they were in a lot of the classes, it showed maybe 30 seconds.  A charm being completed, a potion being made.  Why not have a bit of the class actually shown, like Proffeser McGonagall reading text from her book, or perhaps even all of the STUDYING for the exams, or being assigned homework and projects.  They literally skip from scene to scene to scene, and while I did enjoy going &quot;Oh yea, I remember when Snape said that&quot; or a few seconds later &quot;that was one of my favorite parts of the book&quot;, it gets dull after while, and NO scene really seems to grab you.<br />In Lord of the Rings, they stayed in one spot or situation for at least 5-10 minutes (one reason it was such a GREAT movie), but in this, thats counsidered a LONG scene, and you never really get in to it.  Another problem I had was a lot of things I thought were important still WERE missing.  For example, the EXAMS in my mind were a HUGE part of the year, cut out.  The Elders Mirror or whatever, they spent 15 minutes on.  I think thatcould have been trimmed down to perhaps 5-7 minutes.  <br />Quidditch games?  Only one game shown, about 5 minutes.  Daily classes?  They only go to each class once for the most part, and they don't even go to every class.  They tried to cram so much into this movie, it became almost too little EVERYWHERE!  They cut out the visits to Hagrid except for 1 or 2.  And you really don't get to know the characters.  Everything seems to happen AROUND Harry, never to him.  He almost NEVER gets hurt, he never gets in fights with Malfoy (ANOTHER big part).  Except for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, almost no one did more than a few minutes of acting.   But for everything they did put into this movie, and I know I sound criticle, they DID do an excellent job and created in many's hearts, a classic to the book.  <br />What they DID do well was the last 30 minutes or so, the tasks, Voldemort showing up, the Forbidden Forest, etc...  These last few scenes set the drama, and for a movie aimed at kids, this one was GREAT.  But for the teenagers and adults, this film lacked some things.  Still a good movie and worthy of your owning (I DID buy it on DVD), Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was done very well, and I would reccomend it!<br />2) Graphics: Very well done.  Everything in Hogwarts is put together FANTASTICLY!  The castle, classes, robes, wands, spells, Quidditch matches (EXCELLENT), the unicorns, etc...  The one part I think they didn't do well on was when Harry grabbed the bad teacher (can't say who...not a spoiler) and his head feel apart.  Could have been done a LOT better, but I guess they had the kids in mind.  Everything looks convincing, and while it's no Lord of the Rings, it was done EXTREMELY well, 4 stars!<br />3) Acting: This is where the movie struggled if it did.  Harry Potter (played by Daniel Radcliffe) did a very good job for the most part, but in certain areas, ex. when Ron was nearly killed, Harry (without even looking at him) asks offhanded &quot;You okay?&quot;  &quot;Yea!&quot; gasps Ron.  Harry never even looks at him!  Little things like this popped up every 15 minutes or so, but as these are young actors and should without a doubt get better, they did a pretty good performance.<br />As for the teachers and Hagrid, etc..., acting was done EXTREMELY well.  Within a few years, I'm sure this cast of Hogwarts will improve dramaticly, and while it may not sound like it, the acting was well done.<br />4) Overall: This was a good movie.  The acting was good at most parts, the graphics were above par.  The plot, while sometimes un-inspired or strechted, follows a book that won countless awards.  Everything here is wrapped up into a pretty good package.  There are little things here and there that I didn't like, and I think this could have been trimmed (ex. The Mirror) to about 2 hours, or added more important events.  But overall, this is a good movie, and in my book, worthy of a purchase.  While this isn't going to ever win an Oscar, its loyal to the book, is a great movie for kids and a good movie for adults, and even though parts were kind of choppy, this is a great movie, and being the first of an epic adventure, I expect this is just the beggining of the great moments of Cinema still to come in the series.<br />3.5 Stars / 10<br />Thx!
6302787300|5.0|And so far, nothing, no street date for the film. 1492: Conquest Of Paradise, is a very important historical film, since the events that transpired in the film, basically changed human civilization as we know it. 1492: Conquest of Paradise, would make for a perfect DVD release. It's one of the best looking films I have ever seen, the score and the sound is pretty impressive, the acting and directing by Ridley Scott are very impressive and are the films glue. This movie has been released on DVD in other parts of the globe. But we all know that the best DVD for this film is likely to come from Paramount Studios. All the fans of this movie, Ridley Scott fans, Vangelis fans, and people who teach history, or love history movies, await a well anticipated DVD release of this movie. Come on, bring it on. We all want to Conquest Paradise in the DVD shop.
B00006EXL5|5.0|I've been listening to the songs &quot;Vampires Will Never Hurt You&quot; and &quot;Drowning Lessons&quot; for the past few months while I've been searching the entire state looking for this album.  I finally found it today and I've been playing it nonstop.  I've heard some negative feedback about this album, but I've also heard some incredible things about it.  What My Chemical Romance gives us here is one of the most solid, emotional albums I've heard in quite some time.  The &quot;stab me/stab you&quot; vocals complement the music extremely well.  The album is not groundbreaking, MCR is not creating a new genre or anything, but they're close to perfecting the one they're in.  I wouldn't be surprised if this album (or a follow-up) were to catch on and get huge in a year or so.  I'll admit that when I first heard the song &quot;Headfirst For Halos&quot; I hated it, but even the weak spots of the album are incredible when you listen to the album as a whole.  Now that's a rare accomplishment, an album without filler.  Any track on this album would make a good single (well, on any station that's got a good taste for underground/indie rock at least).  And to make them even better, they're from New Jersey!<br />Standout tracks -- &quot;Drowning Lessons&quot;, &quot;Our Lady Of Sorrows&quot;, &quot;Demolition Lovers&quot;
6305922756|5.0|If I could, I would give this movie 11 stars. Meathead Rob Reiner plays a rock journalist documenting a mid-80's (when the movie was made) British rock band, Spinal Tap. This movie has non-stop comedy: the bass player stuck in the chamber, lost in Cleveland, the metal detector at the airport, just to name a few.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Thank God this wonderful movie is finally on DVD.  I haven't seen it in ages because the second I bought it, my brother claimed it as his.  With twists and turns that keep you hooked to the screen, I can't wait to see it again.  The acting is 100% believable, and the imagry sweeps you away to the era in which it takes place.  I garauntee once you see this film you will be hooked!  Even the music is haunting!  Great movie, worth every penny!
0151008116|5.0|I had a hard time getting into the first few chapters, but once I was \\"in\\", I was hooked.  You can read a dozen summaries of this book on this site, so I won't waste words on the story.  I will, however, say that I found this book to have all the hallmarks of a classic: it is philosophical, intelligent, creative, hysterical, tragic, and beautifully written.  The twist at the end has had me lost in my thoughts since I finished it.  What was Pi's reality?  What was his true salvation?  Is a \\"better story\\" important to the psychology of healing?  How do we handle moral dilemma?  I will have to read it again to try to answer my own questions, and to pick up the threads that I didn't see the first time around.  READ THIS BOOK.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave's debut is one of the most stunning in recent memory, this is a band that delivers on every level and displays what modern hard rock should be and how it should sound. The band arrives with a lot of hype, mostly built around the line-up which is made-up of members of the now defunct Rage Against The Machine and Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell. But never do they conceive retreads to their past work, instead Cornell and his new-found bandmates tear out of their old skins with a roaring new sound. &quot;Audioslave&quot; is not made with the type of repetitive distortion we find with bands like Disturbed, System Of A Down or Saliva, it is a brilliant album with a timeless quality. One of the reasons for this has to be how the band takes from the classics, in this CD one easily finds a unified Led Zeppelin, Doors, Black Sabbath and even AC/DC vibe with a dash of Pink Floyd. &quot;Cochise&quot; is a thundering, roaring opening that sets the stage for the rest of the album. &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot; plays like cool midnight blues filtered through pumped guitar work while &quot;Gasoline&quot; is wonderfully sonic with a touch of classic darkness. &quot;Like A Stone&quot; is a memorable hybrid of a balad with guitarist Tom Morello pulling off a stunning spacey solo. Other memorable moments are &quot;Set It Off&quot; which sounds a scorching sermon, the opening is an interesting display of studio harmonics, and &quot;Bring Em Back Alive&quot; which has imagery of the center of the sun and a city of lepers that summons the spirits of artists like Patti Smith or Jim Carroll. The stand-out performers here are Cornell and Morello, who easily compliment each-other's work beautifully. Morello is endlessly creative and stunning in the intricate, roaring and enrapturing style he plays here while Cornell tears and scares with vocals that can go from passive to insane and scorching. He comes off here as a rock singer turned inflamed poet (much like Jim Morrison onlyvice-versa). This is the kind of album you can enjoy for the sound and also for the lyrics, one grows weary of the weak bands that appear today all sounding like each-other. Audioslave stands out because it simply plays some good hard rock, here is an answer to those hungry for some great new music. And yet nothing here is new, what is striking is how the band takes these elements and lovingly polishes them to a gloss. Cornell and Morello will lose few fans considering anyone who liked the edgy, tearing and heavy elegance of Soundgarden and the pumped-up revolution feel of Rage Against The Machine will appreciate what this album has to offer. &quot;Audioslave&quot; stands out from many recent debuts in that you can actually call it a masterpiece.
0786867973|5.0|I love this book. I am a big fan of Nigella's books, and although I am not really a &quot;baker&quot; - more of a home gourmet cook- I have really got an affectionate place in my heart for baking. This book is great, because when I have the urge to bake, or I need to bake something quick to take over to someone's house, or I want an intricate recipe to spend the afternoon making - this book satisfies my every mood. The easy almond cake is just that, and was so worth buying a springform pan for - looks as impressive as heck and is so quick ;) . Tonight I came home and forty five minutes later I had wonderful rose scented madeleines that were already cooked! What I like about Nigella Lawson is that she understands that so many people have busy lifestyles and that if every recipe that we see for baking is intricate and complicated and time consuming that we just won't do it - we will get too discouraged. There are simple, classic and delicious baked goods that one can make well and make often,  and there are some spectacular recipes when you want to pull out all the stops. Oh, and since I didn't really mention it, there are plenty of savory baked goods in this book, as well as some lovely baked things for children. I just haven't made these ones - yet...<BR>Buy it, don't be scared, baking is fun, and yes, it can be truly therapeutic (especially yeasty breads and things you can pound)
B0000640VO|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  You just feel yourself fall more and  more in love as the movie unwinds.  Amelie is an extraordinary story about a normal girl who is magical in her own everyday way.  To explain it any further would ruin the surprise of this sweet film.  <BR>  Besides the amazing film itself, the DVD is done with as much charm as the movie. The screen tests and outtakes of Audrey Tautou (Amelie) are so absorbing that you feel the thrill the director must have felt when he finally found his perfect Amelie. And there is no feeling of the self-important &quot;look at me&quot; indulgence that so many DVD's have nowadays.<BR>   If you want a little treat, like a piece of chocolate or a bunch of flowers, treat yourself to this movie instead. <BR>   P.S. My boyfriend loved it too.
0743216458|4.0|Not as compellingly written as some of his others. This is still a remarkable story with the human touch as Ambrose always delivers.
B000000W5F|3.0|Yes it's probably their last important release, but consider this; most of the material was recorded a few years prior to this release making it almost like an outtake anthology from the mid-70's. I believe only 4 or 5 cuts were actually new songs that they recorded at this time. The rest date from the Black And Blue, Some Girls, and Emotional Rescue sessions. So in reality, Some Girls in my opinion was their last &quot;great&quot; album. Still some fine stuff here and I still need to buy a copy.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is not only the greatest telling of war ever put onto a screen -- this is one of the finest pieces ever !!! of any subject.  The acting is superb !!!  The action superb !!! You really get to know these guys and start to get attached to them almost as if your right there with them. All the actors make you feel that they are the REAL GUYS !!  Hanks and Spielberg have given the \\"greatest generation\\" their best gift -- the greatest piece of filmmaking ever. !!! CURRAHEE !!!...
B00003ETOW|5.0|it is interesting to note that a few commnetators holding positive views about this version of jane eyre mentioned that they first saw it in the early 1980s in china. i remember distinctly that the film was shown then for english teaching purposes by the english teaching programme of the china central t.v. the script was published in the magazine of the programme as well. it was the first version of jane eyre i watched (as a university student studying the english lang. and lit.), and indeed, none of the later versions seem to do anything to me anymore. i think it is just nostalgia.
B000002J23|5.0|As a long time fan of Yes, I don't understand why so many dislike this album.  Not only did it breathe new life into a band that was pretty much dead, to me it's one of the best they ever produced.  Especially after that awful album \\"Tourmato\\" featuring the Jon Anderson singing the horrid \\"Don't Kill The Whales\\" ... it was embarrasing.  I had given up on them.  Then this album, Drama, came out, and I was stunned and amazed.  From the very bottom, they rose to the very top, and they did it without Anderson and Wakeman.  I say give this one a chance.  It's a great album.  It's one of those ones you put on and listen to, just listen to it, like you'd watch a TV show.  Give it your full attention.  It's worth it.
B00003CX9E|3.0|After reading so much about how this was one of the greatest American movies of all time, I decided to try Citizen Kane.  Perhaps the hype surrounding the picture raised my expectations too high, but I was very disappointed with Citizen Kane.<br />First of all, I can understand why the movie is so highly regarded.  The acting is great, the music is fantastic and the cinematography keeps you involved.  However, from my point of view, the underlying story is weak.  As a viewer I wasn't enthralled with Charles Kane.  I really didn't find his life very interesting and thus the movie that centered around it wasn't interesting to me either.  There is essentially no character development due to the story's structure. Mr. Kane is a static character throughout the whole movie.<br />The only interesting moment I found in the movie was the 'rise' of Susan Alexander's opera career.  She was in reality a poor singer, but Charles Kane's newspapers lauded her as a great singer.  That summarizes my feelings on this film.
B000067CPX|5.0|I've been a Red Hot Chili Pepper fan since I was 8 years old, when they first started. Every album they have made has been incredible, including &quot; By The Way.&quot; They have brought a new style with diverse techniques in their songs. Every song on this cd is great. Every song they have made is great. You will enjoy this from minute one to sixty. With creative lyrics, guitar solos, beats, and style, the Chili Peppers have brought something for everyone to love. Their 3 great singles, &quot;By The Way&quot;, &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;, and &quot;Can't Stop&quot; have already made successful tune ins to the radio. By this album. You will not regret it.
1587990717|1.0|This book is an attempt by the author to answer the question<BR>&quot;If you're so smart why aren't you rich?&quot;. By dismissing<BR>planning and insight, he is able to justify why highly intelligent academics<BR>such as himself are such poor investors. <BR>A disappointing diatribe.
1587990717|4.0|Taleb is profound.  He looks at day to day events but comes up with new ways of explaining &quot;why&quot; and predicting &quot;what could be&quot;.  He demonstrates how poorly perception measures reality.  He illuminates the dramatic role that seemingly low probability events play in shaping the future.  While everyone is taught to plan for usual outcomes, he illustrates the importance of preparing for the exceptions to the rule.<br />Taleb has brought a new perspective to the topic of measuring cause, and anticipating and preparing for effect (risk).  I think his book should be a &quot;must read&quot; for any serious economics / business / philosophy student.<br />I would also recommend reading his interview by Malcolm Gladwell for the New Yorker (easily found via Google.com).
B000077VPU|3.0|I agree with just about everyone else who has reviewed this DVD, how can the people who edited this cut out the BEST performance of the concert which was Extreme's medley of Queen songs. I thank my lucky stars I still have it on tape from when MTV first aired the concert 10 years ago. It's my favorite part of the show and by far one of the coolest moments. The band, most especially Gary Cherone, payed tribute to Freddie and Queen in the best way I've ever seen. The medley of songs were performed with such excitment and the audience loved them. So did I :) This DVD just starts the concert with Joe Elliott doing Tie Your Mother Down, that's like the middle of the show! There were several performances cut out mainly Metallica, Guns 'N Roses, Def Leppard, and the above mentioned Extreme. This DVD needs to be re-issued in it's entirety. I did, however, like those Freddie segments included on the dvd that were shown to the audience during intermission. Those were really cool. Great concert but not shown to it's fullest potential on this dvd and that's a real shame. QUEEN AND FREDDIE deserve more...and so do the fans :)
B00000JMQC|5.0|this trip to oz is deinitley diffrent from the journey with judy as dorothy. i love that good old one. but this is so terrific too. .... faruza baulk is great as dorothy....i will never forget those weird beings with wheels on thier hands and feet, tick tock, and the cabinet of heads. worth owning and viewing again and again. definitley a whole different cup of tea from judy one. you won't be disappointed if you like a good adventure.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it over 10 times and it gets better every time I watch it. This achieves what many movies cannot, its very well worth your time, and will make you think. Whether or not you have seen this movie, you should buy the DVD. It is excellent.
0553208845|5.0|One of the greatest novels i've ever read. Hermann Hesse at his finest.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is incredible. It is full of surprises, and twists you wouldn't expect a war novel to have. It gives you the chance to know each of the characters, and at times you even feel like your one of them. I highly suggest that everyone read this novel, it is one of the greatest novels you will ever read in my opinion.
0316776963|5.0|I read this book while I was stuck in my hotel room with a bad head cold and a baby with same while on a family ski trip. Although I missed the slopes, I had a great time! I could not put this book down. As the highschool reviewer wrote, the chapter about the Rooster is the best! In fact, it reminded me so much of my highschool days 20 years ago that I was in tears with laughter. David Sedaris is a brilliant writer with an amazing ability to communicate - you feel like you've met his parents, family, bosses....experienced his life from his eyes. Can't wait to get my hands on another of his books.
B00006J3T4|5.0|At his best, laid back, tasteful, simple and sweet tone.
0486282147|4.0|Dover has never let me down for purchasing great products, printed with excellence in mind at a mind-blowing low price!  This book will be no exception.<br />Essentially, Holmes finds himself in a mystery concerning a legend of a supernatural black hound that curses the Baskerville family. Holmes is intrigued, and he sends Watson to watch over the new Baskerville heir.<br />The story is classic Holmes, and the action is fast paced and moving.  A fun read with an eye on a classic local legend of the Isles!  Highly recommended.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Im sick of the couple of people here trying to say its not as good as moulin rouge , This is an adaptation of a stage musical that is 30 years old , Moulin Rouge is not , Chicago is a far superior film of the musical genre. <br />Best Film of the year HANDS DOWN.

0446677450|4.0|I think that Kiyosaki did something very generous by sharing the information that got him where he is, instead of keeping it a secret.  I really enjoy the whole idea that you can either be a lemming or you can think and find treasures wright under your nose.  I think this is a great book and inspires me to acheive anything i want because I can, i just have to think, something that many people do not do.  There are more ways of doing things than society lays out for you.

B000000W5H|4.0|No, this album didn't reinvigorate rock and roll like \\"Exile on Main Street\\", didn't provide an epitaph for a drugged-out disillusioned decade like \\"Let It Bleed\\", nor did it mark a welcome return to the Stones' hallowed delta blues roots like \\"Beggars Banquet\\". This album did give the average Rolling Stones fan exactly what he came to expect from the band by 1974- muscular guitar riffing, solid grooves, and an overdose of testosterone courtesy of Jagger's animated vocal posturing. Despite the bad reputation this album has been given over the years, when it comes down to it, what more could you want from a Stones album? There are some truly great moments here (\\"Fingerprint File\\", \\"Time Waits For No One\\" and the title track), some really good ones (\\"If You Really Want To Be My Friend\\", \\"Dance Little Sister\\", \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\"), and some slightly above average ones (\\"Till the Next Goodbye\\" and \\"Luxury\\"). This is not \\"Sticky Fingers\\" by a long shot but it also is a hell of a long way from being an \\"Emotional Rescue\\" or a \\"Dirty Work\\".
B00001U0DP|5.0|Some of the criticism levelled at this film (here) is a little unfair. Yes it is unrealistic in a cartoonish way, and yes it does tackle the holocaust from an unusual perspective. But this deserves praise for it's creativity. The central theme is the triumph of human spirit through adversity - and this spirit is personified through the irrepressable character of Guido. OK in reality he wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes if he had carried on like this in a real nazi death camp - but clearly the film's aim was not to depict an accurate re-creation of this setting. It is about strength of character, the survival of love, and laughing in the face of evil. The mixture of emotions I felt were confusing - it's cliche but I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. This however, is one of the movies strenghs- it challenges the viewer rather than making it too easy. To those who say the holocaust should not be tackled in this way, watch this film again. Under the veneer of light-hearted comedy, this film depicts the true horror, and almost unbelievable pain and cruelty of the holocaust.
B0000508U6|5.0|Rewind to 2000.  Britney, NSYNC and Backstreet were ruling the charts.  The radio was infested with sugar-coated bubble-gum pop.  But, Coldplay was a light in the darkness in 2000.  Who thought that a song called \\"Yellow\\" could be such a hit from a rock band that many considered Radiohead-lite.  However, if you listen to this album, they're not just Radiohead-lite.  This album was explosive in a pop infested world (not to mention it won Best Alternative Album).  So anyway...on to the review.<br />Don't Panic - Great openning song.  It has great lyrics and when seen live, Jon's harmonica solo is awesome.<br />Shiver - One of their first singles off of the album.  This song is really full of emotion and Jon's guitar playing is just excellent.<br />Spies - Very emotional, paranoid song about hiding from someone or something.  If you see it live, it really blows you away.<br />Sparks - Nothing really stand-out here, but the lyrics are really good and the music is soothing.<br />Yellow - When I first heard it I thought it sucked, but then I actually bought the album and I loved this song, it has such great lyrics and Chris puts a lot of emotion into this song.  This is the single that put them on the map.<br />Trouble - Beautiful music.  Chris's piano work is magnificent and the lyrics are excellent.  Another great live track.<br />Parachutes - Short (less than a minute) but still good.<br />High Speed - Great lyrics about living in a high speed world.  Nice effects by Jon.<br />We Never Change - Again, more great lyrics, although it's not a huge stand out track, it's still pretty good.<br />Everything's Not Lost - The closing song.  Yet another emotional song from Coldplay.  If you see it live, Chris has the audience sing along at the end.  If you keep the CD running, you'll hear a hidden track which is also pretty good.<br />Now...buy this and buy \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\".
B000002KBU|5.0|When listening to Mitchell one is split between the imagery of Fitzgeraldean indulgence, and the grim reality of the ideal and reality. Mitchell's vocals are enough to make anyone captivated, but her guitar work, interesting rhythms and overall well crafted songs makes this one of the top five singer/songwriter albums ever. I am sure there are many albums that pack as much personal and emotional \\"stuff\\" into their songs, but none do it with the power and imagery that Mitchell does. <br />Mitchell was one of the females (Holiday comes to mind as the first)first to allow herself to be completely vulnerable and not resolve it in the songs. One feels the powerlessness she tries to convey when she describes a love a lot less than ideal. This brings to the album such a realistic view of love that it consoles much more than idealized love that so few can relate with. In fact Mitchell laments the myth latently throughout this album as we must compare her rugged, self-concious love with the idea of what all think love should be like. <BR>Musically, Court and Spark is a better album, but it is almost two different genres although the thread runs through both albums. In the end we want songs about who we are, not who we arent, and Mitchell dares to do this. But, unlike the modern phenomena of self-deprecating oneself to death Mitchell preserves an integrity and dignity in her human portrayal...Essential!!!!!!!!!!
B00007BH5C|5.0|I was a huge fan of Shore's score for the first movie. So perhaps my hopes were too high. But in the end it feels less epic, and (like the movie) with less heart. A third to half of the tracks were forgettable, while only one or two were in the FOTR CD. Here are the best tracks:<br />1. Foundation of Stone- one of the most epic parts in the CD.<BR>8. Evenstar- only cared for every other elvish-track, but this one embodies Tolkien. Very somber. Extremely sweet! Curently my favorite track.<BR>13. The Forbidden Pool- about the only quiet track I like. Very moody, with several of the themes. A keeper.<BR>17. Isenguard Unlessed- Has pretty good choral pieces.<BR>18. Samwise the Brave- Starts out good, but IMHO a little dissatisfying by the end.<br />Overall, good compliment with the first score, but a bit shallow on its own.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Interpol does recall Joy Division, but where Joy Division was choppy and unconventional, Interpol is smooth and more melodic. There is a pensive tension throughout the whole album that makes it a very engaging and entertaining listen. What is amazing about the album is the maturity of it. A first release is always allowed some latitude as progress or evolution is part of the fun of finding a new band. But, this album seems quite complete, the songs hit the high points correctly, exploit the catchy parts and use tempo change to really create a pleasant experience. <BR>There is the atmosphere of 80's rock that was characteristic of bands like Echo, but the sound is harder. Interestingly, the middle of the album is live which hi-lights the bands ability to put on a good show. They are certainly worthy of mor hype than the Strokes. Their songs are more developed, more mature and vocally much better than the Strokes Vinny Rothbottom or what ever his name is...Interpol good

B000089RVX|5.0|If you haven't heard &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; yet, you will. The song is just one of the many epic and moving songs found on what I consider the best rock debut in a while. Amy Lee has a unique and haunting voice that you will not be able to get out of your head, and that's a good thing. Some of the other standout tracks are &quot;Tourniquet,&quot; &quot;Whisper,&quot; and &quot;Haunted.&quot; The only complaint I have about the album is the track arrangement, it doesn't seem very thematic. Evenescence only has two speeds: scare me slowly or scare me quickly. At times the songs tend to run into one another, but the two or three slower and melodic tunes give the album occasional breaks from the heavy guitar, you can work out or chill out to this one. One great note: not a single curse word on the entire album, even a few shout outs to Jesus and God. While the album isn't necessarily Christian in nature, it carries a much better message than most other artists in this sound genre and stays away from the profanity.
B00004Z400|4.0|I was away from the music scene for a long time. I never really got into the deftones that much. I heard Minus Blindfold on radio station one time and i was just like, &quot;sweet.&quot; so as soon as i returned to the United States, I picked up White Pony and gave it a spin. As soon as Back to School hit i was hooked on the Deftones. Digital bath just kept me in as well as Change. The disc was actually pretty good in my eyes, but not really worth keeping. Until &quot;passenger&quot; hit. now me being a complete Maynard fanatic, heard the words and decided to give ita few more tries. now i've still got it and it gets plenty of play time. but passenger is the best song on here.<br />recommended for new deftones fans, then work your way back.<br />later

Anthony Burgess's masterpiece of a novel is deeply intriguing, insightful, and enlightening on matters of free will and human rights.  Through the first person view and acts of violence on behalf of the central character, Alex, we gain insights into the moral issues of what the persuit of happiness can begin to mean; at what point does your pursuit of happiness begin to violate somone elses rights as a human?  And at what point does somone have the right to tell you that you cannot act a certain way?
B00003CXCK|5.0|This movie depicts all the facets of how simple persecution of a religion can change the world. A scene in which Spielberg was able to summarise the movie involved the \\"little girl in red\\". Here he shows the innocence as this one child is a symbol of all the 6.000.000 victims, exposed to ruthless slaughter.

B00007KWI9|5.0|I just bought this CD last night, and spent the rest of night listening to the disc over and over again. I've already had the previous Atlantic remasters, but this 2003 release really stands out! The opening &quot;Beyond &amp; Before&quot; got me immediately hooked, with clearer bass and vocals, fresher drums sounds. It definitely puts the album several years forward - it adds new &quot;environment&quot;, a lot fresher. &quot;Survival&quot; really kicks out Squire bass - and Anderson vocals has more distinctive &quot;feel&quot; (so you can &quot;feel the sound&quot; :-)), in short, it sounds even better than the version that opens the &quot;Highlights&quot; album several years back.<br />To be honest, this album used to be the one that I rarely listened to, despite claiming myself as Yes-fans for years. This release, however, refresh me so much that I begin to really listen to the whole albums (Survival and B&amp;B used to be the songs that I like from the album).<br />The extras are also worth to get.<br />Now, let's hope Rhino will continue the remaster release - with CTTE, TFTO, Relayer, GFTO and Tormato...who knows what we'll get...20 minutes CTTE over the 18 minutes version?
B00005YW4H|5.0|Several things strike me as I listen to selections from this CD.  First, Norah clearly sings like a lounge singer from an era gone by.  Second, the singing style is somewhat laconic.  Third, the focus here is on her voice and her singing style, and not on the instruments.  The bottom line is that this music is about as far away from modern pop and rock as you can get and not be opera.<br />Norah and this CD garnered an amazing five Grammy awards, including best album and best new artist.  The question is whether the hype matches the quality of Norah's singing and this CD.  I also wonder whether the success of this CD is somewhat of a backlash to the extreme that pop and rock music has drifted with artists such as Marilyn Manson, Hatebreed, and others in the metal and thrash rock arena.<br />In answer to the first question, Norah has a decent voice.  You can understand her sultry words and she treats her voice as an instrument.  The music is pretty and mellow, though exceedingly slow (which thus generates the lounge singer comment earlier).  Given that Norah can sing so well, I think she has the ability to sing faster-paced songs and thus the ability to pick up the pace of a CD.  This CD ends up being romantic mood music for a date or for a lounge and not something I would listen to while driving.  However, it does make for decent background music at work because it allows me to concentrate.<br />As for my second question, I think that in all things there must be balance, and as pop and rock become more extreme, I think it becomes inevitable that a mellow artist would gain the attention of the music world just to have a break.  Norah is not the only artist to cash in on this trend, as women such as Diana Krall and Charlotte Church presaged Norah's popularity.  Also, it is nice to have a singer who relies on her voice rather than exposure of miscellaneous body parts to gain attention.<br />The real problem I have with this CD is that with all the beautiful voices in music today, including women like Diana Krall and Charlotte Church (and many more!), why did awards organizations have to wait until this particular CD to recognize that there is a lot of underappreciated, beautiful music being sung by beautiful voices other than Norah's?  To focus on this one album seems to be a put down to all the other talent that is either in this genre, and is closely associated to this genre.  Such focus on one person seems a bit suspicious to me.<br />Putting aside my wonders at the foibles of the music industry, the singing on this CD is the focus of the CD.  The singing is very well done, albeit somewhat slow.  I would give this CD 4.5 out of 5 stars in its genre, if 4.5 were allowed.  However, understand the style before you buy the CD, because the style may be too divergent from current pop for some listener's tastes.usic today, including women like Diana Krall and Charlotte Church (and many more!), why did awards organizations have to wait until this particular CD to recognize that there is a lot of underappreciated, beautiful music being sung by beautiful voices other than Norah's?

B00000DR5I|5.0|This is perhaps Tangerine Dreams finest recorded work, and is both sublimely beautiful and terrifying.  With an arsenal of analog synthesizers (ARP 2600, mellotron, mini-moog VCS3 etc...), Tangerine Dream shapes icy, grey soundscapes punctuated only briefly by patches of sunlight, and distant ocean waves.  It is this integration of the natural and the mechanical that makes \\"Rubycon\\" such an interesting piece of electronica.  In addition to the contrast of the organic with the inorganic, the pulsing and deeply rhythmic lower frequencies, the mellotron, and the otherworldly sounds produced by the ARP 2600 combine to suggest a larger and much more complicated ensemble. Absolutely essential stuff!

B0000071J0|5.0|Another brilliant recording from Le Orme, \\"Felona e Serona\\" is a 33-minute long concept album that is comprised of a series of shorter songs pasted together with brief instumental interludes, rather than a continuous piece of music.  In spite of the fact that \\"Felona e Serona\\" is generally very somber (thanks to a Roland string synthesiser) and somewhat melodramatic (thanks to the mellotron), the songs are always highly melodic (thanks to the mini-moog).  The musicianship on this recording is excellent, and although the emphasis is on intricate ensemble playing, the keyboard work must be singled out for exceptionally high praise.  In addition, the vocalist is just wonderful and extremely emotive, perhaps even on a level with Jon Anderson in this respect. Interestingly, the impact of the vocals come across despite being in Italian.  Highly recommended.
B000003TAL|5.0|when I first heard this album, I wasn't a huge sonic youth fan (although I am now) nor did I know about the 'hype' behind this album. The first time I listened to it, it didn't grab my attention too much, but the second time, it hit me like a ton of bricks. This album is truely a masterpiece and gives meaning to the word 'art'. The layering of guitars on this album are mind-blowing, the vocals are clutch and the songs themselves are full of power. The album sprials in and out of the chaos and reaches moments that are absolutely gorgeous. Every song is incredible once you give them a chance, but the ones that stand out for me are \\"Teen Age Riot\\", \\"Total Trash\\", \\"Hey Joni\\", \\"Candle\\" and \\"Providance\\" which truely gives the album its flavor, and makes the album cover more understandable. This album is a must for anyone who enjoys music sophistication and high-art in general.

B000006045|5.0|Mezzanine has got to be one of the best electronic albums I have ever heard.  It is a work of pure originality.  I doubt there is anything that will ever sound like Mezzanine.  This album is like the music to a film noir that was never made, its geniously dark, hypnotic and lifting.  The touches of guitar creates the perfect ambient mood for songs like Angel, Dissolved Girl and Group Four.  Liz Fraser's voice is marvelous on the 3 tracks that she sings.  Their couldn't have been a better choice for a guest vocalist on this album.  If you like dark and moving electronic music, or even if you are a music lover and opened to anything, this is definetly an album to own.
B0000640SA|5.0|By now you've hear the story a hundred times and each time you hear it, it gets more confusing (actually there is nothing more confusing then trying to navigate through the menu).  Aside from the &quot;hook&quot; (the story backwards), this is fine, fine, fine film noir.  Not to mention the number of times you'll have to watch this to understand it, you will get engrossed in the characters, and their interactions.  Trying to figure out what's real....well that's another story.
B00005LDD9|2.0|I never saw Metropolis except for small sections referenced by other films. It always appealed to me and I finally took a risk buying this used for cheap. Even at an inexpensive price I'd strongly advise to skip this version.<br />As others have noted the trasfer is terrible, the music is good but sound quality is terrible too. Having watched this version of Metropolis I was able to get some kind of plot out of it and even with the poor film transfer the imagry is at times stunning.<br />Here's my advice; if you just have to see Metropolis and do not want to pay the substantially high price of the Kino version buy this copy, but understand...and please take my word on this as I'm one of the people that made a similar decision, know that you are getting poor quality all around.<br />Whether this will ruin the film's experience for you has more to do with your aesthetics. Metropolis has major historical importance and watching it I could see where other favorite dystopian films liberally borrowed ideas. In the end it was acceptable for the price I paid. I would not buy this new and would cough up the extra money and get the Kino version if buying it new. I will be purchasing the latest DVD eventually just to be able to enjoy the superior quality.<br />5 stars for the film being wonderful 0 stars for the quality. The average would be 2.5 and although it's a great film Metropolis is gutted by this poor DVD. When reading reviews it is easy to take it personal, that a poor review of the DVD (a product) in some way says something negative towards the film on it. In this review the quality of the film is the only reason more than one star was given.<br />My last parting shot...<br />The reason I even bothered with the Mandacy product was because so many negative reviews on Amazon have been baseless or inane one line insults I have become numb to them. Take it from a usually easy to please reviewer. Stay away from this DVD.
B00005JKJA|3.0|David Lynch has a reputation for bringing you someplace and then making you get off in the middle of nowhere and then you have to find your own way home.  Mulholland drive is no exception.  You've got to admire this guy thought.  He does not play it Hollywood.  He knows his movies have a slightly \\"bent\\" appreal but he makes them the way he wants them to be.  I stayed with this movie faithfully through the first half (I guess I'm a Lynch fan) and then the \\"lesbian sexual scene\\" began the second half of the movie in which everything you learned from the first half gets pulled apart and turned upside down.  The end gets a bit too \\"mondo bizarro\\" but if you really want to figure this one out you'll be watching it more then once (and not just for the lesbian sexual scene).
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is the final chapter of the holy trinity that is Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning. Here Green Day look foward to the future that was hinted at in Nimrod. Green Day sing about understanding yourself, being yourself, relying on oneself, and the future. Green day end the album with the verse: &quot;I'm thinking about A brand new hope/The one I've never known/Cause now I know It's all that I wanted&quot;. This is the exact opposite of the statement Insomniac opens with: &quot;I must insist on being a pessimist&quot;. In the space of three albums, Green Day has laid out a musical mission statement about resolving the past, being who you are, and facing the future with hope. These three albums are my soul and I hope that at least one other person out there has the opportunity to experience them as such. Enjoy!
B00004RF9B|5.0|How wonderful it was to see this movie again.  From the hokey electronic soundtrack to the meglo-maniacal scientist this movie has it all.  A simple United Planet recon trip to a colony established some years earlier turns deadly.  I'm sure Gene Roddenberry watched this very carefully as this could have easily been a superior star trec episode.  I saw it with my 18 yo NYU daughter (who has been buying her comics in a place in lower manhatten called &quot;forbidden planet&quot;.)  Now she knows why.  A classic amoung classics.  (Maybe next time they could remaster the sound?)
0345448898|5.0|No praise is high enough for this fabulous series by Philip Pullman. I have read these books 4 times each so far, and each time I do, I am struck once again by the beauty of Pullman's writing, and captivated by each of the novels's (sp?) intense plot. Also, because there are so many fibers of meaning in each of his novels, I realize something new each time I read them again, like parts of a gigantic puzzle that I piece together. The fantasy worlds created by Pullman, which almost cannot be called fantasy because they are so like our own, are captivating enough so that the reader, or at least I, finds themselves there, with Lyra and Will, battling Specters and befriending witches and armored bears. I would be very surprised to find someone who didn't think highly of these books.
0140067477|5.0|This was a really great book! I read it after I had done a school project on Taoism, so I had a slight clue as to what I was reading about, but I really wish I had found this book when I was doing the project! Its explanations of the concepts of Taoism are wonderful in that nearly everyone can understand them. Pooh and pals are very public figures and most people are familiar with their basic personality traits, so using those traits to explain Taoism was a very smart idea.
B000002518|5.0|Bob Dylan gathered together a cracker jack group of musicians to record this excellent soundtrack, a romantic and mythic ode to a west that could only have existed in a collaboration between two artists walking the desperate line between sentimentality and mourning.<br />Sam Peckinpah when making the deeply flawed but often beautiful companion film, tottered on the abyss. The film may have marked his falling off the precipice, but Bob Dylan's brilliant fusing of folk, country and western and rock provided a sonic union rarely found in soundtracks. This album serves as a funeral dirge not only for the mythic Billy The Kid, but for Sam Peckinpah also. In fact, Dylan's score makes the film work far better that it perhaps deserves to.<br />Granted, like the film it echoes, this album does often sound redundant. But when it hits as it does with the brilliant opening theme \\"Billy\\" (Wes Anderson resurrects it most magnificently in \\"Royal Tennenbaums\\") and of course the classic \\"Knocking On Heaven's Door\\". Dylan even pulls off a comical Kris Kristofferson impersonation in one cut. Much of this album contains arguably some of Dlyan's finest instrumental and acoustic work. The sheer sound of the music evokes strong images of southwestern sunsets and small rivers rolling lazily by sandy dunes. It evokes images of time passing and figures holding passionately to the ephemeral. To quote the film:<br />\\"It feels like times have changed\\"<br />\\"Times maybe. . . but not me.\\"<br />Like Ry Cooder's equally excellent score for \\"The Long Riders\\", Dylan transcended time and space and created a great album that made a film work.
0688152023|5.0|Just looking at the wonderful pictures in this book makes one want to get up and start doing the exercises right away so they can be that graceful and elegant. I did the exercises in the book during the summer after my dance team's season ended so that I could stay in shape for the next season. The book has a lot of really good stretches that would be helpful for a beginner or an expert, or anyone in between for that fact. The illustrations are really helpful for making sure that the exercises and stretches are done correctly (as well as encouraging the reader to continue in this pursuit so that, some day, they too can be that gracful and that flexible!).

There aren't any tracks I'd skip, and I definately recommend this CD!

B00004XQP4|4.0|Well,like i said, the title says it all, warning: this is not the greenday of smoothed out slappy hours or even dookie, but that is not neccesarily a bad thing, if your one of the people who says greenday sold out, stop and think about what sell-out means, sell-out is when you do something that you don't want to do simply for money or some other self advancement, greenday's deal in the beginning was that they wanted their music to be heard on a larger scale. The fact is all these little angry punkers are just sad they don't have greenday to themselves anymore and that they have done what most great artists do and transcend over time and arrive with a more mature sound. i love every greenday album because i like the music, yes i'll admit i started out on dookie like most greenday fans, but i immediately wanted to know more about the band and discovered their pre-dookie albums and loved them, i can't help that i didnt have the exposure to greenday before dookie, i was only 9 years old when it came out anyway, i know ive gotten off the subject of warning, but i felt that needed to be said before i talked about warning, well ok now that is out, warning is a greenday doing the same thing they have always been doing(playing 3-chord pop songs) with a more mature, roots of rock n roll music(the who,the beatles) spin on it and it really sounds great, this cd is great for anyone who appreciates classic rock or listens to it because it shows greenday exploring their musical canvas, which is what a rock artist should do, if you stick with same formula for too long and dont try different things once in a while, it gets boring, now i like pennywise, rancid, the dead kennedys, and NOFX just as much as the next punk rocker but i'm tired of greenday always taking a bad rap, open your mind and you shall benefit, keep doing what your doing greenday and keep putting out awesome music, peace,love,and empathy,ryan
B000005JA8|4.0|Legend has it that when Don Vliet set out to write the songs for this album, at one rehearsal, he sat the band down and said, &quot;listen to this.&quot; The Captain then began to scream, howl, chant, recite and grunt for several minutes like a man insane.<br />Then, nonchalantly, he turned to the band and said, matter-of-factly, &quot;Can you guys play that?&quot;<br />&quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; is the result of the band &quot;playing that.&quot; <br />No, its not standard blues changes.<br />No, it's not three-chord love ballads.<br />Yes, it is challenging, sometimes frustrating and annoying to listen to. <br />But that's the point. Captain Beefheart was never about making the listener comfortable, even on his earlier, more &quot;straightforward&quot; LPs. <br />There is much to enjoy here. &quot;Orange Claw Hammer&quot; tells the story of man reunited with his daughter after years at sea. &quot;Ant Man Bee,&quot; &quot;The Blimp&quot; and &quot;Neon Meate Dream of a Octafish&quot; (sic) are main chapters of the Beefheart oeuvre, as are &quot;Pachuco Cadaver&quot; and &quot;Well.&quot; <br />Frank Zappa's rather dry production actually adds to the mood of this album, and although Don hated it, I think it's a main element of the entire effect. He's also not afraid to try bizarre recording techniques. In &quot;The Blimp,&quot; the lyrics are literally phoned in by the vocalist, and in one or two songs, it appears Beefheart is singing into a Dictaphone, as you can hear the thing clicking between lines of the song. The &quot;click&quot; becomes a kind of odd percussion for the track. It's disarming and amazing all at once.<br />Granted, if you're not used to this kinda stuff, you're not gonna make it through &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; the first time or two without taking a breather. It is challenging, to be sure. But that's why critics and other connoisseurs of classic rock rate it as one of the 100 best rock albums ever made; it doesn't just break barriers,it creates new ones for some future adventurer to break through. I'm not sure anyone has done that yet.
0312305060|2.0|The idea was a good one, and it was extremely brave and ambitious of M Cunningham to try to weave the 3 lives together. But ultimately he failed, in my opinion. Just as I began settling down with one character and thinking of her perspective, there would be an immediate and abrupt jump back to another character. As a result, I felt a lack of connection and also a lack of sympathy, for any of the 3 women. Each was interesting in her own way, but there just wasn't the time to mentally bond with any single one of them. While it was an interesting literary technique, I found myself losing interest in the book half way through and had to force myself to finish it, which is unusual for me. All the hype didn't help as it heightens ones expectations.
B000069CWE|5.0|The whole point and appeal of Hybrid Theory what that instead of blending hip hop and hard rock such as many bands have done before, the two styles exist harmoniously in the music of Linkin Park. Both styles are distinctive and can be heard clearly and through the talent of Linkin Park, done so the two styles do not clash.<BR>Hybrid Theory, in my opinion, had a heavier emphasis on ROCK rather than the HIP-HOP. Reanimation is a great compliment to Hybrid Theory because it emphasizes the hip-hop aspect of the group. Kind of like Yin and its Yang, Reanimation brings balance to Rock/HipHop ratio of Hybrid Theory.<BR>I really enjoyed listening to it. There is a lot of talent brought in by the special guests and very well produced.
B00003CXC6|5.0|The recent Criterion release of Rashomon was, to me at least, very satisfying. While others are not totally satisfied with the picture quality, it's not really bad at all. It was, after all, a small scale low budget film (Kurosawa was still a relative new-comer- probably along the lines of Spielberg after Jaws), but there is nothing in the lines of picture and sound that detract from the viewing experience.<br />And that experience is indeed a memorable one, between the artful collaboration of Kurosawa and Miyagawa. The four accounts of the incident are like the filming of the characters going into the forest....almost mystical, and surreal with strong contrasts in sunshine and shade, the sunlight (truth....?)itself being obstructed by the mysteries of the forest.<br />The disc includes an intro by Robt. Altman, some material with Kazuo Miyagawa, the cinematographer, and an interesting commentary by film historian Donald Ritchie.<br />The accompanying booklet has, among other things, selections from Kurosawa's autobiography and the original two short stories upon which Rashomon is based.<br />While certainly not definitive, there is enough material to whet the appetite (at least) to one of filmdom's truly great masters, and is nothing that Criterion needs to be ashamed of!
0060987464|5.0|In this book, Marilyn Manson reveals everything about himself, and it portrays the \\"Shock Rocker\\" as a real person, not just the crazy demon that everyone depicts him as.  He is smart, interesting, and you get a feeling of what its like in the world of a rock-star, and all the problems they go through every day.

0451450639|4.0|The book that started many people reading science fiction in earnest and still probably Clarke's best known work. I have always thought it a good book, but certainly not one of Clarke's best. The beginning is still one of the best I have ever read as Clarke looks at primitive proto-humans and suggests that the monolith, representing an extra-terrestrial super-intelligence stimulates them into acquiring skills that appear basic but could mean the difference between survival and extinction at the hands of the less intelligent yet vastly more powerful beasts around them. The subsequent stages i.e. the discovery of the monolith on the moon, the voyage of the Discovery, the quirks of space travel, the showdown with the HAL computer and then the final denouement out by the moons of Saturn must have been awesome when the book was first written; today, many decades later, they are inevitably dulled. Yet having said that, the story itself is gripping: the struggle of humanity in the face of odds, with a kindly helping hand at the right time - almost in some ways an experiment in a vast laboratory. The story is humbling, suggesting as it does the sheer insignificance of earth in the universe (a Clarke specialty unlike Asimov who goes the opposite direction). As always, Clarke's writing style is top drawer - sparse to the point of terseness at times (this is a very short book for all its huge time horizon), yet filled with subtle humor and sly digs at ourselves.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Although I am not the most inclined fan of the LOTR trilogy (I truely don't find anything SUPER FANTASTIC about it, but it's great though), the Two Towers soundtrack is awesome!  Highlights of the OST are:<br />Foundations Of Stone - great opening strings piece (very moving), and nice homage to Khaza-dum theme<BR>Evenstar - the choral piece is very soothing music<BR>Breath Of Life - just like Evenstar<BR>Isengard Unleashed - begins like a track from Gladiator OST, in that voices are like that of Lisa Gerrard with Hans Zimmer's instrumentations<BR>Gollum's Song - very mysterious, but musically interesting<br />Some MINOR downfalls:<br />Many soft portions of music (hard to hear if have no good bass)<BR>Some unlikeable changes from the movie edit (in Foundations Of Stone, loud voices before Gandalf's abyss descent)<BR>These aside, this is worth buying!  It has a great diversity in soundscapes.
0393312836|4.0|A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant novel written by a British author by the name of Anthony Burgess in 1962.  The main character Alex narrates the book that is divided into three parts with seven chapters each.  This book takes place in the future of Alex's hometown during the beginning and the end... There is a lot of crime in this futuristic world and not very much law...<BR> You may find that while you are reading this book there is a lot of vocabulary you've never seen or heard of before.  If you try to look these words up you will never find them in a dictionary.  This is because Burgess made up most of the language in this novel.  Some books are equipped with a handy glossary in the back.  Mine did not have one.  It is hard to understand at first but after a while you get used to it.  The new vocabulary is based on the Russian language.  It really offers a feeling of being in the future and knowing what it feels like to be there since it seems that you are reading the lingo of the future.  You should try not to use the glossary because it fun to figure it out on your own.
0553212478|5.0|Robert Walton, an explorer trying to discover a Polar Passage, sights a strange, giant creature among the icy environs. Shortly thereafter, he encounters a man on a sleigh, of ill health, who calls himself Victor Frankenstein. He is chasing after that creature, his own monstrous creation, who he created in an obsessive desire for knowledge and power, only to find himself haunted and distressed at every turn by his creature--whose only desire is for companionship, respect, and love from his creator, who hates him, and society, which abhors him. Frankenstein retells his story to Walton, interspersed with the creature's own eloquent thoughts about how he became a murdering wretch. The two of them are bound by destiny to end their lives in misery and shame.<br />I don't know which Hollywood screenwriter turned a multilayered, profound piece of literature such as Shelley's Frankenstein into cheap horror schlock, but anyone who is only familiar with the Halloween caricature is in for a surprise. Frankenstein is immensely readable (compare this to Percy Shelley's \\"Prometheus Unbound,\\" which covers some common ground, and see the difference), but there are some genuine wrestlings about why men seek after knowledge, and the ways in which that pursuit can have unintended consequences. There are cogent allusions to the Bible, the myth of Prometheus, and Paradise Lost, reflecting the way in which Frankenstein's Faustian quest becomes a degraded recaptulation of God's creation of man and the rebellion of Satan. Plus, there are moving and eloquent entreaties from the creature himself, whose descent from goodness to coldblooded vengeance is detailed in a startingly believable, psychologically plausible manner. Nor does Shelley's work merely echo stereotypical Romantic themes such as the innocence of man before society and the oppression of social mores--while those elements are present, Shelley's narrative brings up numerous ambiguities in those ideas (some of which were heavily promoted by her famous husband). So there's little surprise that this text is assigned in most English departments and classes on Romantic literature--this is, its popular reputation aside, a genuine work of Literature, capital L with all its hoity-toity implications. There's too much richness here that Hollywood has put aside in its filmed versions, and it would be a great shame if most people aren't aware of just where those visions came from.romoted by her famous husband).

Keep up the good work Mayer!!
B000055Y0X|5.0|Mad General Jack D. Ripper of the Strategic Air Command, concerned about the purity of his \\"precious bodily fluids,\\" launches a pre-emptive attack on the Soviet Union with his bomber wing, based at Burpelson Air Force Base. His executive officer Captain Mandrake, President Merkin Muffly, and the Premier of the Soviet Union Kissoff, all try to rein in the bomber team currently headed toward its target in Russia, before the dreaded Doomsday Device is set off, ending all life on Earth. But why is ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove smiling so much?<br />One could go on about the tight plotting and even belivability of the situation depicted in the film (the opening disclaimer notwithstanding) and the unforgettable images of Major Kong riding the bomb, but the real star of the show in Dr. Strangelove, is, without a doubt, Peter Sellers. He plays three roles in this film: Captain Mandrake, the President, and Dr. Strangelove, and in each of those three largely improvised performances he comes up with unforgettably hilarious lines. (The comedic monologue as he speaks to the Premier is especially funny--never have multiple apologies been so true!) The obvious phallic references throughout are both funny and satirical; Kubrick's slams on the military mindset and the military-industrial-sexual complex were dead on for that time period, when the world was regularly on the brink of destruction. Somehow, brilliantly, he found a way to make people laugh at the sheer horror and absurdity of the situation. Though this is a laugh-out-loud comedy, the subtext of the film is very dark indeed, suggesting that given the chance, human beings will destroy themselves and take the whole world with them for the sake of ideology and \\"purity of essence.\\" This film also marks the beginning of Kubrick's idiosyncratic use of music; the world's destruction is set to the score of Vera Lynn's \\"We'll Meet Again,\\" and the lush, serene string music that accompanies the beginning of the film is incredibly ironic . . . . Though we are not quite as afraid of nuclear annihilation by the Russians now, the film remains incredibly watchable and compelling, and an eternal indictment against the gungho/hawkish element that seems to be itching to attack anyone, at any opportunity, regardless of the consequences.ironic . . . .

I read &quot;Life of Pi&quot; in two days (probably b/c I was stranded in St. John's) and it possessed me.  Deep down I knew it was fiction but Martel had me living Pi's life as if it was my own.  I felt determination, fear, thirst, and an amazing amount of love for that cat.  It's incredible how Martel drew me in like this and I love him for it!

0375703861|5.0|White Teeth by Zadie Smith was a book filled with the fictional stories of many people from many different times and of many races. It is a book fit for every age and any race. Zadie Smith uses a sharp sarcastic comedy that keeps you laughing at the worlds' gut-busting problems. White Teeth contains a truckload of philosophy and challenging ideas. Though the book wasn't all laughs, aside from its humor it dealt with various problems and shined a light on the many pitfalls in life. The book deals with war, love, suicide, religion, race, drugs, as well as many other issues. Smith goes full throttle into many controversial matters. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. It was one of the most hysterical novels I have ever read but it also made me stop and think. I cannot wait to read another of Smiths' enlightening novels.
0553275976|5.0|Bonfire of the Vanities is one of the great page turners of the last half of the 20th century.  Wolfe combines comedy with scathing social commentary, as a blue blooded Wall Streeter takes the wrong exit off the highway and two cultures collide with tragi-comic results.  It was impossible to put this book down, even though it is quite lengthy.  The beleaguered Bronx judge, the girlfriend, the Harlem reverend who thrives on playing the race card for his own greater glory and the slimy reporter are just some of the characters who ring true.  <br />For those who saw the movie, don't let that turn you off.  The whole premise was changed and it was a typical Hollywood bastardization.  Wolfe tried a similar sweep of the cultural landscape in &quot;A Man In Full&quot; but lost his way halfway through that book.  There are no wrong notes in Bonfire; it's a snapshot of New York politcally and culturally in the late 80's, and it's amazing how little has changed in today's world.

0812550706|5.0|I have always enjoyed science fiction, but rarely do these books get placed on my favorites list.  There are a few notable exceptions, and of these exceptions, Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card is my favorite.  I have read it over and over again and explored all the sequels.  Even if you are not a science fiction fan, the rich characterization, the action and the depth of this book will draw you in.<BR> Set on Earth sometime in the future, the book's main character is or Andrew Wiggin, or Ender as he liked to be called.  Ender is a \\"third,\\" a child his parents were only allowed to have because the International Fleet, or IF, is looking for brilliant children with the right temperament to train as military leaders.  Ender's older brother, Peter, was too violent and malicious. His older sister, Valentine, to whom he is very close, was too passive to be trained.  That leaves Ender.  Ender chooses to go to Battle School when he is just 6 years old.  He leaves his family and begins life as a Launchie, the youngest of the ranks at Battle School.  The Battle School orbits Earth, and the children are in armies.  They fight in zero-gravity to learn strategy and command.  <BR> The IF needs soldiers for the time when the buggers will return.  They have already tried to invade Earth twice, and exactly how they were beaten is a mystery. The IF is in search of a commander who will be able to defeat the buggers in a third invasion.<BR> Ender's stay at battle school is fraught with challenges and loneliness.  He is deliberately ostracized from the other students and is given challenges that break all the established rules.  His fight to stay alive and to be the best is interesting and entertaining.<BR> Meanwhile, his two equally brilliant siblings are down on Earth influencing political policies through the internet, when they are just 10 and 12 years old.  <BR>Card does not treat his characters like children, but instead gives them the autonomy and intelligence to act for themselves.  He treats them as children would want to be treated, which is part of the appeal of the books.  In fact, readers will forget that the characters are children.  In the introduction to the book, Card quotes a young reader who wrote to tell him about the impact the book had on her group of very smart peers.  She says, \\"...we are the enders of today.  Almost everything written in Ender's Game...applied to each one of us on a very, very personal level.\\"<BR>Ender's Game is full of fast paced adventure.  Each step in Ender's journey, the reader cannot help but root for him to win.  The way he copes with playing the battles and with winning the respect of the other students is fascinating.<BR>This is a book with many levels.  It can be read merely as a fun science fiction book, but it is much deeper than that.  There are themes like \\"manipulation is acceptable when the end justifies it\\" and \\"the qualities of a good leader are the ability to see the whole picture and earning the trust of his or her followers.\\"  It also addresses the issues of becoming what we fear we will become and if murder is ever an acceptable option.  Military strategy is also a large part of this book, but it is never dry and unreadable.<BR>Card's book, which was the winner of both the Hugo award and the Nebula award, is the best kind of science fiction.  It combines adventure, well-developed characters, an interesting premise and many different themes.
0393312836|5.0|I was pretty excited when I first picked up A Clockwork Orange a little over a month ago; I had heard how this book had changed the way people thought and lived, and now I'd see for myself how this tale of a bleak future could do that. It took some time to adjust to the garbled Russian-English slang called Nadsat, and seeing as the paperback that I purchased didn't have a glossary of the lingo in the back, I spent less time following the story and more time making an effort to translate. After you figure it out, you'll definitely appreciate some of the dialogue.<br />The book follows a young no-good-nik, Alex, and his cohorts. The book begins with Alex and his `droogs' at a bar, where liquor isn't served, but milk, because the milk is laced with a plentiful variety of opiates and hallucinogens. Alex spends every night having fun, which, for him, means raping wives in front of their husbands, beating the daylights out of old vagabonds on the street, killing random people, and theft. He is morally a disgrace, but I really liked how honest he was as he narrated the story. When he is thrown in the slammer for two years, he learns about an experimental Government program for turning homicidal delinquents, like himself, into reformed, productive members of society. He tries it, since it'll get him out of jail in a fortnight, but he didn't know it involved a forced, VERY long viewing of different films of rape and violence, while being injected with nausea and pain-inducing drugs. The Government, arrogant in it's certainty of success of the experiment, thinks this will change his patterns of thought and that Alex will associate rape and murder with pain and vomiting, rather than thrill and ecstasy. Nonetheless, it seemed to cure him, and he was sent back out into the world, which more or less turned on him, driving Alex to attempted suicide.<br />A Clockwork Orange isn't a light read. The book provokes questions of whether or not a person should go through such a horrificprocess to become an upstanding citizen, or if he should be able to choose his path in life, being a lowlife or a decent person. Anthony Burgess writes with fantastic intensity, and the reader won't want to put the book down. The language in the book is imaginative and colorful, but I won't spoil it in the review.  This is definitely one of the century's great novels, and whether you like it or not, it'll at least give you something to think about for a while.

B00000DGUM|3.0|What's here is all good. The reason for the 3 star rating is for what's not here. It's missing \\"Wasted Time\\", and \\"In A Darkened Room\\" from the second album Slave To The Grind. They could've added \\"Big Guns\\", Sweet Little Sister\\", \\"Makin' A Mess\\", or \\"Here I Am\\" from their first. At least one song from the B-sides EP should've made it on (Rachel's version of \\"Psycho Therepy\\" would've been great). The remixes of the Subhuman Race songs sound the same to me, other than \\"Breakin' Down\\" which they should've just left alone. \\"Forever\\" and \\"Fire In The Hole\\" are both ok previously unreleased tracks. This is a good cd, but with only 3 full length albums out, it's more worthwhile to get those instead.

Anyone who loves animals and is thinking of maybe becoming a vet would love this book,too.  There may be a lot of pages to read, but this book keeps you guessing what will happen to him next.  I would love to recommend this book even to people who love adventure stories.  In this book you may be able to relate to a lot of problems that Herriot has.  Some of his problems are easy and some are hard.  For example sometimes he comes in late about midnight then gets a call to deliver a calf at 2 a.m. in subzero temperatures.  I hope you take my advice and read this wonderful book.

6304806418|1.0|This movie is a complete betrayal of the original stage play. Evita is softened not to offend the Argentines during the filming from the monster she was in the play. Che, \\"a revolutionary\\" in the film is a watered down version of the Che Guevara character who functions as a Greek chorus in the play. Who is Banderas playing anyway? The director cutting the most damning of verses in his songs which criticize Evita completely emasculates this character.<BR>Not as bad a performance by Madonna as in Swept Away, but she is wooden and lost in the crucial dramatic scenes. Her \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" lacks the power of Patti Lupone's and is inoffensive at best, revealing what we always knew in the first place, Madonna is a studio creation with a weak voice. The biggest crime is the stealing from Peron's mistress the song \\"Another Suticase in Another Hall\\" and giving it to Evita. Theft is the correct term because despite what the director has claimed, the only reason Evita was given this song was that Madonna liked it better than any other song in the play and wanted to sing it. This film is a star turn for Madonna. Turn it down. It's a pity too. The play is my favorite musical.
B00006AW2F|5.0|\\"Metamorphisis\\" was originally released in 1975, reached number eight in America and number 45 in the UK. It was their 21 American release and 17th UK release. It is little more than a mishmashed compillation of old tracks from their first thirteen years, but these sixteen previously unreleased tracks are certainly something to be cherished.<br />Kicking off the album is an alternate version of \\"Out Of Time\\". This version is very romantic with a very nice string arrangement. \\"Don't Lie To Me\\" was included on their very first British ep, but was never released in America. The version of \\"Heart Of Stone\\" is an alternate take and this is noticably different from the final version, being that the intro has been shortened. \\"I'd Much Rather Be With The Boys\\" is a girl group-style ballad that is is quickly likeable, and \\"(Walkin' Through The) Sleepy City\\" is Beach Boys-esque. However, the cover of Stevie Wonder's \\" I Don't Know Why\\", perhaps the greatest track on the album, was said to have been recorded the night Brian Jones drowned to death. \\"If You Let Me\\" is cheery love song, but \\"Jiving Sister Fanny\\" really does it. This funk-rocker is killer. Great guitars and nice bass drive this one. Bill Wyman's \\"Downtown Suzie\\" (or \\"Lucy\\", as Mick calls her in the song) is excellent too. \\"Family\\" is a frightening tale of a problematic (you guessed it) family that really gets to you. \\"Memo From Turner\\" and \\"I'm Going Down\\" are probably about drugs, and they draw you in with enough listens to satisfy you.<br />\\"Metamorphisis\\" is a very enjoyable album. Hopefully, the band will acknowledge this album by including some of the tracks in their live set.

B00005OAIE|4.0|I'm not sure what the agenda is for those who are bashing this &quot;brat&quot; on this site but the short and long of it is that this album offers up easy-going, relaxed mood music that has some nice introspective, hook-laden pop. This album doesn't reinvent the wheel but the lyricism isn't bad and the music varies from easy-going acoustic 7Up bounce-pop to Lite FM jazzy-pop. Not sugary-sweet but not much edge...and while the album doesn't hit you hard in the face or assault your ears, it's definitely better than other stuff out there. And I'm not sure what reaction James Taylor's debut album garnered, but I know that critics (and many people at the time) panned Led Zeppelin. If it's good music it will last. Not sure if &quot;Room For Squares&quot; is worth a Grammy, but it's definitely worth a listen.

B0000021RG|4.0|to begin with i have to say that this is the first album i ever owned-having stolen it from my brother! everything that i would later value as a musician is found on this set:group interplay, great use of color and dynamics, the value of the moment unvarnished,and the belief that each player must shine. i love almost all of the tunes-except &quot;i don't want your money&quot;- and think some are better than the originals-&quot;beginnings&quot;, &quot;in the country&quot; and &quot;happy 'cause i'm going home&quot;. the sound though is very dull on these cd's as compared to even the vinyl. this set is in bad need of re-mastering and hopefully they will get around to it. last,the packaging is a big disappointment compared to how luxurious -by '70's standards- the original boxset was. they need to include the pictures that came with the album even if they can't put in the 2 wallposters and the booklet from the original! still, all in all,it contains lots and lots of great music performed by a band who loved their music and loved playing.worthwhile at any price.

B00004BZ0V|4.0|It's obvious that to really know the Clash, is to get all their albums. But since you here, you're probably looking for a good package of hits. This is a great remastered single disc collection spanning their entire career. Based on what's here, I gave it 4 stars. If you're missing some songs, you may be interested in the older two disc collection, \\"Story of the Clash\\". That has 10 more songs than this does. If that's still missing your favorite songs, you may want the newer two disc, \\"The Essential Clash\\". That has another 12 songs, and 22 more than the singles collection, all remastered. The most for your money by far. Of course if it still doesn't have what you want, then you've come full-circle, and must get all their albums. There's a reason why The Clash are in the R&R Hall of Fame. RIP Joe Strummer.
B000006O7C|5.0|Sketches is one of the best albums I own. It is also one of the most anguishing. This duality exists because the music was never finished, they are but &quot;sketches&quot; of the work that was to become &quot;My Sweetheart the Drunk&quot;. Some are studio takes, others rough and barely realized 4-track demos. Had they been finished, they would be astonishing. As they are, they are still incredible, and we should be so lucky to have even these. The music is groundbreaking, particularly the second disc of mostly 4-track recordings, and the lyrics are denser, more evocative and evolved. They are also heartbreaking, as you can almost feel the creative energy in each note. Some are put off by the rough quality of the demos, but they have their own charm in Jeff's exuberance. The one flaw is that this album doesn't contain more of the actual demos. Two tracks are a rather pointless alternate mix, and both discs are on the short side. There was a wealth of extra material that could have been drawn from however, such as two tracks placed on b-sides, and foreign releases, as well as bootlegged tracks of demos that are only available illicitly. These are all oustanding and original tracks, and should have been included on the official release. If Jeff had lived to record &quot;My Sweetheart the Drunk&quot; as he had intended, it would have been phenomenal record. Instead we have these gorgeous blueprints of what might have been, and at least that is something. I urge you to explore this album.
B0000025T6|5.0|&quot;You wanna know why I did what I did; well, sir, I guess there's just a meanness in this world.&quot; So ends the first and title track of this album. The song 'Nebraska' is based, like Terrence Malick's 1973 movie 'Badlands', on the story of the 1950's killer, Charles Starkweather. As with all the songs here, Springsteen sings in the first person, becoming the characters he breathes to life. The first song, chilling and nihilistic, sets the tone for the rest of the album, which portrays the stark working class existance of small town life.<br />Here we meet people living on the edge. People with a thin sense of hope running on empty. Yet out of the initial depression and bleakness of his landscape, Springsteen can find a humanity in many of his people, still shining just beneath the surface.<br />This is not an album for everyone. Certainly, it is different from most of Bruce Springsteen's music, perhaps finding it's closest echo in 'The River'. The sound is raw, apparently recorded in Springsteen's own basement, and features a solo performance with only guitar and harmonica. It's tone and sometimes despair recalls the desperation of the dust bowl blues; the lyrics resonate like Raymond Carver stories put to music. Never before or since has Springsteen created such evocative slices of life with such an economy of words.<br />All in all, an extraordinary album. Unique, wild, raw, and beautiful. Deceptive in its simplicity, and disturbing too. A great album.
B000005RT8|5.0|When I first heard McCartney II, I was in junior high and had been turned on to &quot;Coming Up&quot; after seeing Paul perform live in concert.  The studio version of &quot;Coming Up&quot; took me completely by surprise.  The mood was much different than the live version, more like pure unguarded fun.<br />The entire album is pure unguarded fun.  It is the sound of Paul McCartney unwinding in the studio and just doing what comes naturally.  The sound of the recordings take some getting used to, but once the shock wears off, you may find yourself in a truly enjoyable sound-world, where cold-sounding synths provide neat little proto-ambient-techno textures.  It may be difficult to imagine or even accept Paul McCartney playing music that hasmore in common with Joy Division and Suicide than the Beatles, but make no mistake, it all sounds natural, unforced, and infinitely more FUN than anything Joy Division or Suicide ever did.  Not that I am slagging them -- both are/were great, just more 'serious' than someone like Paul McCartney, who prefers to keep matters light.<br />So obviously, this album will not appeal to everyone.  However, if you have an open ear and enjoy a little adventure, McCartney II just might be your cup of tea.  As you can tell, it's one of my favorites by Sir Paul, right up there with Ram and Band on the Run.
B000069CWE|3.0|First off, In the End. They completely butchered it. I try to skip that one as much as possible. And what's with all those phone calls? I want to hear music, not your answering machine. Some of the songs did get beter, like Crawling. They somehow managed to make an already perfect song even better. I kinda think they cheapened thier original album but I was able to get used to the changes. After all, if you don't like a song, you can always just skip it.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard a sample of Evanescence during the Daredevil movie. They were the reason I bought the soundtrack. The contrasts between rap-rock genius &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and the eye-watering &quot;My Immortal&quot; shows that this is a band with serious depth. After some online sampling, I decided this was a cd I needed to own. With the opening track, &quot;Going Under&quot;, Evanecence grabs you imediately. Amy Lee's vocals are incredibly strong and beautiful- even when she wails! (&quot;Imaginary&quot;) Musically, Evanescence is like a well-oiled machine. Guitar riffs are Linkin Park cool and all of the bridges have attitude. (&quot;My Last Breath&quot;,&quot;Taking Over Me&quot;) Orchestras and choirs add romantiscism to the dark and edgy sound. (&quot;Tourniquet&quot;,&quot;Whisper&quot;) If lyrics are your thing, Evanescence gives poetry a 3rd dimension. 'I am the lie living for you so you can hide'- &quot;Hello&quot;. Everyone will have their own favorite songs (this album is that good!) but mine is &quot;Haunted&quot;, I've never heard anything as scary- or pretty.
0393312836|3.0|In a terrifying society placed in the future, Burgess takes the reader and shoves us into the reality of a boy named Alex and his three friends. Their world is one focused on ultra-violence; outrageously low performances of betrayal, as well as brutally untainted sadism. If one were to look deeper into this novel, beyond the despicable acts of violence, you would find that Burgess has posed several questions worth considering. Some of these points are especially disturbing. Alex, being the criminal he is, was brainwashed. He was supposed to be morphed into a person that would chose to behave morally in his society. This made me question whether or not a man who was restricted from his own free will could be considered moral and ethical, or if it has just made him a brainless sack of idiot. If one is rendered incapable of evil, would that make him better than a man who is evil because he chooses to be? Even more unsettling is to question if it is moral, in a sense of punishment, to confine a human being's free will to the point where he is a zombie? Furthermore, after this point of zombie-like moral restraint, are the remains a man, or something less than that? Burgess will have the reader fantastically engaged in all of the problems that lead one to contemplate these disturbing questions. Although this book is a complete horror show, all these issues are entirely worth considering. I liked it very much.
B0000714BP|4.0|The movie itself is still great (but not a great as The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert) but the DVD version is disappointing.<BR>When I found out that it was going to contain deleted scenes, I was hoping that they would have been included in the movie. Instead they group them together as an extra. Granted after watching those scenes, it was understandable why they were deleted and/or changed. The only scene I would have added is when the &quot;girls&quot; are driving up the mountain and the car stalls and a truck was barreling down on them.<BR>I have always enjoyed this movie. Wesley Snipes is hysterical as Noxeema Jackson (Jessie's daughter). His one liners and acid like tongue were perfect. Patrick Swayze was very matronly as Vida Boheme. The too tall drag queen that still has her driver's license with the name of Eugene on it. John Leguizamo was the most brilliant of everyone. He was so outrageous and razor edged funny (not to mention you had to think if it was really a woman playing Chi-Chi). He was the struggling would be drag queen who describes herself as the &quot;Latino Marilyn Munroe-I got more legs than a bucket of chicken.&quot; <BR>Basically the movie is your typical need to be accepted and proving the odds wrong.
B00003CXBK|4.0|At first, I had some misgivings about the whole \\"anime\\" thing.  I figured they all had bad animation and bad plots.  Well, this one, my first, surprised me.  The animation was as good as I have ever seen, while the story is very interesting.<BR>    It is about young man who is infected by a plague of hatred.  He has to rid himself of the plague, for it has taken over his arm and will take over his whole body and soul.  At the same time, his quest leads him to be the mediator between two clashing cultures: iron making people and forest loving animals.<BR>    As \\"anime\\" goes, I hear it is one of the better ones, but for just an entertaining movie, well it is different, but not bad.

B00007E8V4|4.0|I never was a huge fan of System of a Down, but their latest release \\"Steal This Album\\" is actually not too bad and sounds better than some bands on their regular albums.<br />Compared to the \\"Toxicity\\" album, the tracks are better spread out and have more styles like the acoustic flavor of \\"Roulette\\".  Some of the standouts are \\"Bubbles\\", \\"I-E-A-I-A-I-O\\", and the hard-driving \\"F--- the System\\".  There's nothing as musically brilliant as the song \\"Toxicity\\" though thankfully nothing as musically schizophrenic as \\"Sugar\\" or \\"Chop Suey\\".<br />But as it is an \\"alternate tracks\\" album (seeing as how they don't like it being referred to as a B-sides album) some of it is just filler or flat-out dumb.  Maybe I missed the hidden subtext, but the prattling off of pizza toppings on \\"Chic N Stu\\" just didn't seem to fit at all.<br />I did like the album, but I doubt it'll linger on in my memory.  Whenever they release their next true album will be the true test of me believing the hype.
0399229191|5.0|We started reading this book to our 5 month old son and he loved it from the beginning!  Every page has a different animal with the specific noises each animal makes.  My son laughed at each page and especially loves the last page with the owl hooing.  We read it almost every day!
B00000JY1X|4.0|Okay, I'm a latecomer: I'd never heard of The Magnetic Fields or Stephen Merritt until yesterday. I was sitting in a cafe where a radio was playing and I suddenly heard &quot;Papa Was a Rodeo.&quot; It was like someone smacked me upside the head. Music rarely gets my attention this way, but that song immediately struck me as the best thing I had heard in years. I went home and searched the internet to find out what I'd been listening to and that's when I first learned of &quot;69 Love Songs.&quot; I bought the whole box set on the strength of having heard only &quot;Papa Was a Rodeo.&quot;<br />I'm glad I did. Sure, there are a few clunkers in the set, but the range of great songs is amazing. I listened to Elvis Costello a lot in the 80s and despaired of ever coming across another songwriter with that kind of talent. So I'm really glad I was at that cafe at just the right moment!<br />If you're looking to buy just one volume, Vol. 1 is the best -- but then you'd miss out on &quot;Papa Was a Rodeo,&quot; which is on Vol. 2. How can you resist a song whose first line is &quot;I like your twisted point of view, Mike&quot;? Go for the box.
0805017445|5.0|Although our just-one-year-old granddaughter has lots and lots of books, this is absolutely her favorite!  I think it's the simple, colorful, big, bright pictures on a two-page spread.  We add the animal sounds when we read it and she just giggles in delight!  She brings this one to us to be read more often than any of her other books.  She also likes Polar Bear, Polar Bear... but not as much as Brown Bear.  I'm actually buying a second copy so that she can have one at home and one at Grandma's house.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|You probably know by now that this movie goes backwards. The main character Leonard(Guy Pearce) suffers from this condition that he forgets everything in a few seconds, and he has to write his appointments quick before he forgets. He only remembers his life before the murder of his wife, and revenge is his reason to live.<br />It's a great interesting movie. Just watching how he deals with the people around him make this movie a different experience for the viewer. <br />Natalie(Carrie Ann Moss) and Teddy(Joe Pantoliano) help or manipulate(you'll be the judge) Leonard in his quest to find his wife's murderer. And believe me every scene you will be asking yourself what are the true intentions behind these people. <br />Definately, you have to watch this movie a couple of times and it wil never get old. An excellent movie to own. But remember this is a thriller, if you expect an action movie this is not it.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This is a terrific synergy of Metallica and the symphony.  If you like classical music and/or appreciate the fantastic music produced by Metallica this is the one for you.  If you like Metallica merely for the head banging aspect - you'll be disappointed.
0385472951|4.0|Thankfully, John Grisham has written another page turner in the great tradition of THE FIRM.  This novel has so many twists and turns that you may want to buckle your seat belt for a thrilling ride!  I couldn't wait to finish reading this book--it was hard to put it down.  The entire time I was reading I was thinking, &quot;there is no way Patrick is going to get out of this one!&quot;  As in Grisham's previous 'lawyer' novels, I was fairly confident that the protagonist would not only survive his predicament (and come out on top), but that the villains would 'get theirs' in the end.  I really couldn't see how our dear Patrick (I ended up really liking him and respecting his intelligence) would prevail.  He had too many variables against him.  Plus, he confessed to most of his crimes.  I should have just trusted Grisham to give me the ending I wanted and he sort of did.  I don't want to give away anything but I was a little disappointed in the last few pages of this story.  Everything else though, was typical Grisham.  I recommend THE PARTNER to everyone who loves to read.
6305538018|5.0|I recently saw this movie.  I had not even heard of it but after watching it ranks in my top 5 favorite movies, EVER.  It keeps the \\"is this real or am I dreaming\\" type storyline throughout keeping you on the edge of your seat in suspence to the very end. Highly recomend it!
B000002L9Y|5.0|Having first noticed Fleetwood Mac on British television in 1983 performing &quot;Oh Diane&quot;, I was intrigued when this group returned in 1987. They were obviously very different from everything else I was into at the time. I got into the singles, especially the two Christine McVie tracks which were huge hits in the UK. I didn't actually buy the album until 1989, when I was captivated by Stevie Nicks' &quot;Rooms on Fire&quot;, and I have never looked back. This is an incredible record, and although many regard the late 1970s as the Mac's classic era, this remains their most intriguing and engaging work of the 1980s. It began as a Lindsey Buckingham solo album, but he was persuaded to turn the tracks he had already completed into a Mac album. The opener &quot;Big Love&quot; remains the great track it has always been. It is dark, brooding and powerful. It moves into the wonderful &quot;Seven Wonders&quot;, on which Stevie Nicks turns in a real tour de force on a wonderful Sandie Stewart song. At the time, the individual members of the Mac were not in good shape, and although there are flashes of pain throughout this album, it is testament to Lindsey Buckingham's skill as a producer and arranger that the album holds together so well. &quot;Everywhere&quot; is without doubt one of the best songs Christine McVie has ever written. Her talent in the band is still underrated, and she held them together through many a turbulent period. &quot;Caroline&quot; is catchy, but vapid, and contains some of Lindsey's less powerful lyrical statements. Side One (as it was originally) concludes with the balm of Christine McVie's tender &quot;Mystified&quot;, before taking flight again with &quot;Little Lies&quot;. Christine surely wrote the strongest songs on this record. The plaintive introduction to this pop ballad is haunting. Stevie Nicks' backing vocals are prominent, but that was not always the case. Stevie was absent for much of the recording of Tango, thanks to a cocaine habit which sent her to the Betty Ford clinic. She writes frankly of her experiences on &quot;Welcome to the Room...Sara&quot;. Christine rocks on &quot;Isn't it Midnight&quot;, before the album hits its most tender moment with Stevie's ballad &quot;When I see you again&quot;. When I first heard this out of context as the B Side to &quot;Everywhere&quot;, I thought it was awful. Who was this croaky woman with the raspy voice? Now it makes much more sense. It is the sound of a desperately sad woman, wondering how it will be to be reunited with the band on which her dreams were founded. Stevie was on a path to self-destruction, and you can hear that in every note of this wonderful song. Lyrically it it stark and utterly effective: &quot;And she stares at the stairs../well, there are many things to stare at these days&quot;. Lindsey's response at the end of the track only adds to its poignancy. The album ends on a bright, poppy note with &quot;You and I Part Two&quot;. However, rather like a great Smiths song. the bounciness of the melody masks lyrical uncertainty. History has shown us that Lindsey was preparing to leave the band. &quot;Hoping tomorrow will never come...&quot;. This was to be his swansong, and the (artistically)disastrous &quot;Behind The Mask&quot; confirmed that there can be no Fleetwood Mac without Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. Happily, the fairy tale is not over and the band (sadly without Christine) is about to release a new record, &quot;Say you will&quot;. In the meantime, you have to listen to this wonderful album with its 12 magnificent chapters. The sooner it is remixed for DVD-A, the better.
0425107469|5.0|...and among my favorite novels.<br />\\"Rushing toward her was a creature that had surely escaped from Hell. It let out a shriek of madness and rage.\\"<br />Watchers has it all. Smooth, entertaining plot that gets resolved in every way. Deep, origional, and believable characters. I felt for Travis and Nora. I laughed and loved with them. I also felt their fear, desperation, and sadness. I hated Vince. And he also pulls off, with amazing talent, the believeble character of Einstein--\\"Home is where the weeines are.\\" Gotta love it. This book will grab you, pull you in, and not let you out until the end. It will leave you saying, \\"wow,\\" and eagerly waiting for that rainy day to pick it up again.<br />I'd recommend this book for those new to Koontz. It's an easy read, but by no means a simple book. If you're looking for dozens of plot lines, characters as deep as the Grand Canyon, and \\"crazy, mental\\" ideas ala Stephen King, this book will not provide. It will, however, tell you an awesome tale. Both Stephen King and Dean Koontz are wonderful authors, but it would be comparing apples to oranges. Beyond that, unlike most of King's novels, parents can give this book to a relitively mature child--there's minimal sex and language (compare that to King's IT--not kiddy material, but an awesome book too!) Pick up this book no matter what your favortie genre. You'll add another favorite author to your list.<br />As Koontz says in the afterword of my edition, this is probably his best work. He knows it. And it shows. Get it today.
B00005MAM2|4.0|I?ll just state up front that I didn?t really understand everything that was going on in Akira.  I understood the basic story, that of Tetsuo trying to find an identity in a motorcycle gang, but when he meets a strange child he has psychic abilities which begin to awake in him.  The animation is fantastic, and it is easy to see why this was one of the first anime to gain mainstream acceptance in America.  I?m just a little confused on the story.  Watching it, there were a lot of moments where I just think, ?What the hell??  The story is easy to follow, but a little difficult to understand.  I?m not sure about the motivations of some of the characters, and very little backstory was given on the characters.  It felt as though I was being led along on a ride, but I didn?t know where I was going and only had a vague idea of how I got there.<br />With that said, Akira is an anime classic, and any fan of the genre absolutely has to watch this.  Akira has influenced much of modern anime and before Akira, I wouldn?t have imagined that anything animated would contain that level of fairly realistic violence.  This is worth watching, perhaps two or three times to get a chance to better understand the story.
6301790170|5.0|wow! this is some movie! there was hardly any script (dialog). it's more of a adventure per se. a real life kind of thing without all the drama added to it, (yet the drama was created solely off the adventure). the first 40 minutes is more of a 10 minute brief on establishing each of the 4 characters, and the rest of it is the adventure! the best part is the truck riding over the rope bridge as you can see on the video jacket. all of it is good anyway!    they don't make movies like this anymore.    by the way, i liked this movie so much, i rented the original french flick called \\"le salarie de la peur\\" aka 'the wages of fear'. in this version, you'll have more drama and character development. i enjoyed this one as well, but the ending is different and very unexpected, and i found it to be quite hilarious.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Believe me if I had listen to the bad reviews, I definately would have missed out on a truely amazing movie. Yes it is dark, and some viewers won't get it, but this is a superhero movie not another Citizen Kane(overated, but good). After the success of Spider-Man, Daredevil was destined for runner-up status. Darker than Spider-man (and has better special effects), this $80 million extravaganza was packaged for maximum global appeal, its the plot beginning when 12-year-old Matt Murdock who is accidentally blinded shortly before his father is murdered. Later an adult attorney in New York's Hell's Kitchen, Murdock uses his remaining, superenhanced senses to battle crime as Daredevil, the masked and vengeful \\"man without fear,\\" pitted against dominant criminal Kingpin and the psychotic Bullseye, who can turn almost anything into a deadly projectile. Daredevil is well matched with the dynamic Elektra. This is a Hollywood product that die-hard fans will love. .... Why do people expect a huge deep thought provoking plot from a superhero movie! Daredevil is a must see!!
B000002WPI|5.0|Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) was released back in the days of REAL hip-hop. You know, back when Snoop Dogg's middle name was &quot;Doggy&quot;, Jay-Z only had one nickname, Nas's name was Nasty Nas, and Common's name was Common Sense (this is also when RZA's name was Prince Rakeem; see where I'm going with this?). Really, there isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said by everyone else except for the fact that the most interesting thing on this album is the intro where the Method Man describes the duties of each Clan member. This lets the listeners know that each member has an individuality and that this isn't just a rap group full of indistinct no-names. <br />The Clan touches on hard-time topics (&quot;Can It Be All So Simple&quot;), old-time mic-rocking (&quot;Clan in Da Front&quot;, where Genius really shines), and they even give the first member who would drop a solo album a chance to shine (&quot;Method Man&quot;, which uses an interpolation of Hall &amp; Oates's &quot;Method of Love&quot;; where else do you think the &quot;M-E-T-H-O-D&quot; line came from?). The best songs are &quot;Shame on a N&quot;, &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot;, and...well, everything on here is good. And although their follow-ups and solo projects would be hit-or-miss, it's good to look back to this album and see how it all began.
B000060P79|1.0|what an awful, awful attempt at &quot;punk rock&quot; which is a genre that has been exploited and dissolved in the mainstream music biz a long time ago. if you have heard blink 182, good charlotte, or sum 41, you've heard this guys already. simple plan brings nothing new to the &quot;punk&quot; genre, they only make it more watered down and corporate than ever. the only reason you see other reviews on this page saying that they are good is because those people have not been exposed to true music, only what they can reach by mtv or the radio. here are bands that are better,louder, and more significant:<BR>the white stripes<BR>burning brides<BR>the donnas<BR>supergrass
6301016289|4.0|WAL STREET is a very entertaining film about corruption in the world of high finance during the 1980's. Although it is marred by the inclusion of too much gratuitous profanity, the film is noteworthy for several fine acting performances. Michael Douglas is superb as the greedy and ruthless Gordon Gekko. Charlie and Martin Sheen are both convincing as the neophyte stockbroker and the principled union boss respectively. As usual Hal Holbrook rises above the crowd with his sympathetic portrayal of the dissillusioned older broker. According to the Internet Movie database, Jack lemmon was considered for the role ultimately given to Martin sheen. It is possible that Lemmon might have been a good choice for this part too.<br />The main competition in 1987 for Academy awards came from THE LAST EMPEROR and MOONSTRUCK. In spite of the tough field, Michael Douglas still managed to win an Oscar for Best Actor in recognition of his work in WALL STREET.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Wow. I never expected the movie to be as good as it was. I heard that it had amazing dancing (it does) and really good music (it has that too). This movie will blow you away with its artistic design. It has wonderful costumes and cinematograhpy. What I love most about the movie, however, is that the singing and dancing kept the original Bob Fosse style. <BR>  Even non-musical-lovers will enjoy this movie! This movie is still playing in sparce theaters, so go see it in the movies before it leaves the theater. Believe me; you will want to have seen this when it wins Best Picture this year.
1558908382|5.0|Hit man Martin Q. Blank is in an awkward situation. Several of them, actually. He's attending his high school reunion on an assignment; he's got a rival hit man (Dan Aykroyd) on his tail; and he's going to have to explain to his old girlfriend why he stood her up on prom night. He regrets doing that believe me. I don't wanna ruin the movie for you, so I'll keep this short and tell you to see this movie right now! It is great, it's ike Die Hard meets High Fidelity. 5 Stars is to low of a rating for this movie!
0920668372|4.0|\\"Love You Forever\\" is a story about a mother and her child.  Throughout the story, it tells about how her child grows up and changes during his life.  In the book, it tells how no matter what her child is like, she will always love him.  At night she sometimes creeps into his bedroom and sings \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.  After doing this for many years, she gets old and sick, so her son comes to her house and sings it to her.  Then he takes up the tradition and starts singing it to his newborn child.<BR>I think this is a pretty good book because even though it is a bit repetitive and can get a bit boring it gets across a pretty good point.  It shows the love that is between a mother and her son.  It shows the devotion to each other that each of them has.
0805066691|5.0|We hear about both sides of colonial history so often these days that a book like &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; can seem a little trite, even biased towards the Indian side of the story. In fact this book is 30 years old and is the book that _produced_ this shift in perspective--before its publication the Indian side of the story was never part of the mainstream culture in the first place. Still an important work on early American history, &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; is also seminal in its own right. Read it by all means; if you're already familiar with American Indian history, you'll have the proper context to put it in, and if you're not, you need the wake-up call.
0783225482|5.0|I never get tired of watching \\"Death Becomes Her\\" on VHS, and would buy a widescreen DVD version in a heartbeat (got your stethoscope, Sidney Pollack?). The film is perfectly cast. Bruce Willis is a miracle of anti-Bruce Willisness. Isabella Rossellini is over-the-top hilarious. Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn are given great lines, and perform them with brilliant excessiveness. The actor and actress who play the plastic surgeon and his assistant are outrageously funny, him with his roving eye, her with an exaggerated French accent. One reason I truly cherish this movie is that it is able to present uber-eccentric characters as believable. Few movies pull this off.<br />Apart from the acting, terrific script, well-executed special effects,  rich visual colors (look, for example, at the scene where Helen Sharp [Hawn] stands outside Dr. Menville's door with an umbrella), another reason I cherish this movie is because every frame is interesting, and for many reasons. With some movies, you can name the truly interesting scenes. With this one, every scene is priceless! Still, my favorite moment in the film is where Helen Sharp explains how they will kill Madeline Ashton. It is done with narration, voice-overs, an eerie mix of normal and slow-motion effects, and the darkest of humor. One of my favorite moments in any movie---ever!<br />I took this movie under my wing when it first came out. My favorite dark comedy, and one of my favorite films of all time.
0441172717|5.0|DUNE is the seminal work in science fiction. I first read the original not long after its initial release and like our good friend &quot;slipknot dude&quot; was put off by the constant referal to the glossary. After several shallow attempts I put the book down for two years and then once again on the advice of a good friend I tried again, &quot;This time,&quot; he said,&quot;just read it.&quot; &quot;Don't stop, don't check, just read.&quot;  then, as if by some unknown force, I understood. The beauty, the majesty, the sheer span of this awe inspiring book.<BR>If you want to understand what is happening in the middle east today and why, read DUNE.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|Unless you like movies that deal with just sex and drugs, then I recommend seeing something else. Yes this movie is dark, but that was the point, so I enjoyed that aspect of the film, and the ending was perect, but it just drug in to many places. See Pi instead, it is much better.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Simply the best film of the year, probably too difficult/odd for you if you loved Twin Peaks and aren't familiar with the other Lynch films. This film was a happy accident, demands repeated viewing. Would have been nice if the DVD had chapters however, I guess we will have to wait for the second release.
0671015206|5.0|Amazon[.com] Review of \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\"<BR>I must have read the book ten times and recommended it for everyone I care for and bought a dozen of it for distribution to close people. It is one of the best books in the field. I came to live in the United States thinking that everyone in my posh neighborhood OWNS his vehicles and has a good chunk of asset in his house. This book told me a lot about the American life and taught me how to bring up my children in a healthy financial way. I highly recommend it for everyone interested in knowing the deep secrets of the life of rich and not so rich people in USA.   Coming from the Middle East, where one should pay for everything he owns; I was astonished to witness what has happened to my rich-looking neighbor in my upscale neighborhood in USA when he died from a car crash. He was not only not rich, but he was very much under. That really validated the true nature of this book. I wonder how one can enjoy life if most of the things he own belongs to the banks and he pays so dearly on them!! Rather than spending years to come up with the truth about the real American life, one should read this book from cover to cover, perhaps as many times as he can.
B000021XS0|5.0|This is the most orchestrated, beautiful, wonderful, excellent, superb music album EVER released.  I was blown away when I listened to it.  I couldn't just listen to some.  I had to listen to it all.  And that is how it has always been.  This cd had been in my stereo longer than any cd I own.  This is the ultimate!
B00007FOMP|5.0|...thas' the opening line of the opening song which happens to be the title track of 'What's Going On', one'a the most powerful statements ever issued by any artist of our time. An' nothing sums up the thoughts that've been running through my head in the past week better. There comes a point when a certain album like this that you've heard countless times through the years means more to you than ever before. Well, that point has reached me in the most tragic way. A young lil' homie'a mine was killed on March 10th. He was only 15 years old. An' this has devastated me. An' now I'm turnin' an' listenin' to Marvin Gaye's over 30-year-old album an' the message is ringin' clearer in my mind than anything. This entire album is a statement that examines the turmoil of a world on edge an' the deterioration of our society that never seems to change an' never seems to be able to pull itself together.     I will run down the ways in which the songs on this album have hit more close to home than ever before. On the song 'Flyin' High (in the Friendly Sky)' he puts it best when he says \\"I go to the place where danger awaits me, an' it's bound to forsake me, so stupid-minded.\\" Stupid-minded. Thas' the best way to describe the way our values have chosen to set themselves, when we either can't or choose not to see the very serious problem arising when our youths are becoming so cold an' heartless that they'll take each other's lives over nothin'. An' when so many hafta drown their sorrow an' hurt in a bottle'a booze jus' to cope with the foulness the poor an' underprivildged are forced to accept, this world can really eat away at an idealist like myself. The message continues to pound into my brain on 'Save the Children' when he asks \\"Who really cares to save a world in despair? Who really cares?\\" All'a this music is set to smooth an' breezy R&B backdrops that float along with the powerful words an' questions Marvin presents. He didn't so much as present the answer, as present the problem an' ask for someone, ANYONE to offer any positive suggestions. This, unlike anything today, is music with longevity, because everything he speaks will forever be relevant in this world as long as we continue on the self-destructive path that we're on. Whether you agree with the spiritual musings of 'God is Love' an' 'Wholly Holy' is irrelevant, because he is no way forcing it upon you. It's jus' Marvin's personal stamp on the album, because he was raised in a churchgoing household an' spirituality is how he, an' many others like him (me included) give comfort to themselves during the everyday tragedies of life. My favorite number on the album comes in 'Right On', a mid-tempo Latin-flavored number in which Marvin offers his thought an' contemplations on the way the average man views his life an' his place in this world. He lets the instrumental stretch out for five or six minutes then changes the tempo an' offers his sweet an' melodic harmonizing of love an' peace, before letting the beat pick up an' ride out the song. To me, it's the most overlooked song of the entire album. Marvin closed the album with 'Inner City Blues (Makes Me Wanna Holler)' in which set to a simple, yet haunting backbeat an' melody Marvin expresses all his frustrations, anger, heartbreak, an' concern for the group homes, projects, an' every burrough an' ghetto in the country an' the impoverished people that live in a day to day nightmare where they can't support themselves or their family an' where fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, an' most disturbingly children are increasingly more an' more subject to senseless violence. It's a powerful anthem that is chilling an' heartbreaking all at once.     I guess the saddest aspect of this album is that as long as it's been since it was recorded an' released an' as long as music historians an' fans alike have revered it as one'a the best albums to ever come out of modern music, we've done nothing but listen to the message. Well, we needa do morethan that. I don't like seein' people, 'specially young people, dying in vain, an' I expect most of you would agree with me on that. So let's all learn from every young person who has been cut down before they had the chance to blossom into the king that they could've been. An' let's change our ways. For over 30 years, we've listened to Marvin plead with us to do jus' that. To save the children. An' is' high time we started acting on that plea, instead'a jus' listening an' thinking about it. Rest in Peace to Omega \\"Buddy\\" Morris. A glaring reminder of the harsh times we live in.
B00005OWEG|5.0|By reworking his original film, Francis Ford Coppola takes a good film with flaws and turns it into a major work of art. The original version contains vivid images and great sequences, but wore me down and finally became tedious because Kurtz and the horror he represented were never clear.  Apocalypse Now Redux answers all these questions.<br />The river journey is now complete; the additional scenes show Williard's rebirth and apotheosis much more clearly. The breakdown of order also becomes more frightening. Consider in the original cut, we go from Kilgore to USO show to the Do-Long bridge to the boat massacre to Kurtz. There is no breakdown of order or perception here. In the Redux version, we see the breakdown; the insane outpost where the Playboy Bunnies/sirens wait amid corpses and choas, and where this is no commanding officer (this plays against the Bridge sequence), the soldiers refuse to answer questions, wear their hats sideways.<br />After this encounter, the Do-Long bridge makes so much more sense; the last very last outpost is not only leaderless, but in utter disarray. The Roach tells Willard he knows who is command, with a knowing smile of insanity.<br />Past the Do-Long bridge Willard and the crew find the ghosts of the French. Once again the perception shifts: these people may or may not be real. Roxanne, the French woman who sleeps with Willard, smokes opium with him, and then closes him in a shroud of gauze; he can't really touch her, as if he too were dead.<br />When finally we come to Kurtz and his madness, all civilization is dead. Kurtz is savage, powerful, and insane. It's not just the gibberish Kurtz says, its the living among the severed heads, the brilliant eyes, the heavy face that hesistates. Kurtz is the breakdown of order personified, and Willard understand that his order is broken down as well. He must kill Kurtz not because he was ordered to, but because Kurtz wants to be sacrificed to the Horror.<br />This is a work of art, a masterpiece of cinema, and redemption of Francis Ford Coppola's career. Don't make the mistake of thinking this film is about US involvement in Vietnam. It is not, the movie is set there, but the story is now universal. Apocalypse Now Redux achieves the mythic resonance that Coppola and co-writer John Milius tried for in 1979.<br />I remember the orignal New Yorker review of Apocalypse Now. Pauline Kael said that film failed because Coppola tried to show not just evil, but Evil. AP Redux remidies that mistake: there is no question that Kurtz is Evil. Too bad Kael isn't around to see this stunning version.<br />Possibly the second greatest American film after Citizen Kane, now, in my humble, humble opinion.masterpiece of cinema, and redemption of Francis Ford Coppola's career.

0800141660|5.0|Ang Lee must represent a new kind of film-maker. He is able to span cultures (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and genres (The Wedding Banquet) while creating definitive works for each. Sense and Sensibility brings Jane Austen to life - not an easy task in today's society. Kate Winslet is gourgeous and impressive. My only disappointment is that Winslet and Lee haven't teamed up again since.
B000002JSN|5.0|Look, heres the bottom line: if you're looking for the best rock 'n' roll album currently in extistence, get Physical Graffiti by Led Zeppelin. It is simply that good. Every single song is a standout track. Page's guitar playing is the best it ever was; Plant's vocals are, as always, amazing; and Bonham and Jones truly do create a Hammer of the Gods. Not before nor since Physical Graffiti has any band reached such absolute brilliance (save for maybe the Beatles). Buy it, listen to it, and memorize it.
B00005NC66|5.0|This is hands-down one of the best movies ever made.  Just the opening seconds of Jean-Paul Belmondo smoking announces a whole new attitude towards youth and life that hits with the freshness of the Beatles.  \\"Breathless\\" creates a world of love and motion and danger and art that's single-handedly responsible for at least half the clich&eacute;s you have in your head this second about Paris.  Truffaut's script is excellent, nearly every shot is original and revelatory, but what I loved most about the movie was the apparently random, documentary feel Godard gave to so many of the scenes:  Belmondo with one lens missing from his glasses, the faces he and Jean Seberg make in the mirror, the Air France clerk sticking her tongue out at her boss, etc.  How did Godard manage to be so stylish and truthful at the same time?  This is a movie that never lets you forget it's a movie, telling a story in a way no novel or play ever could.  \\"Citizen Kane\\" is the only other film I can think of that does so much with the medium.  One for the ages.
B00008OOZ9|5.0|Once again the White Stripes have delivered a spectacular piece of music.  Elephant is pure magic.  The opening track \\"Seven Nation Army\\" will have you listening over and over again with its catchy bass-filled rhythm.  \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" is a great song.  Jack White kicks his guitar into overdrive and his screaming vocals match perfectly.  \\"In the Cold Cold Night\\" is personally one of my favorite tracks on the album.  Meg White delivers wonderful vocals that are very intriguing, backed by a simple beat.  \\"Ball and Biscuit\\"  is another great song.  It has a very bluesy sound to it with great guitar riffs from Mr. White.  \\"Hypnotise\\" is by far my favorite song off the new album.  Its a straight forward rocking tune.  It has the energy of \\"Fell In Love With A Girl\\", but in a way surpasses that song and in my opinion is much better. Every other song on this album is solid.  Not a single one is just ok. They are all great.  This is tough for me to say because I love all the White Stripes albums so much, but Elephant is better than all 3 prior records put together.  When April 1 rolls around do whatever you can to get your hands on this album.  In the mean time keep listening to the other 3.
1400031354|5.0|I absolutely love all three of the books that A.M. Smith has written about the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency!  Precious Romatswe is an incredibly brilliant character.  Her high sense of morality and respect for others (demonstrated by her following in the \\"old Botswana ways\\") is a breath of fresh air.  I also love how comfortable she is with herself, being a woman of \\"traditional build\\".  It is so nice to have a book about a large, successful, bright woman.  The fact that several cases are solved within each book is a bonus.  The cases are not the main part of the book, but only small part of the whole experience.  Precious Romatswe and the unfolding of her life hands her is what takes center stage.  The descriptions of Botswana make you feel that you are there, and make you long to actually see it.  It makes you want to take more notice of your own surroundings.  I recommend all three of the books from the Ladies' No. 1 Detective Agency to everyone, and cannot wait until the end of April for book number 4!
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is unbelievable as life...<BR>Great french cinema!!! You should have seen it!
B000007MVM|5.0|This album is like discovering an attic door to the '60s you didn't know was there.  Barrett hits all the pet themes of your favorite English heads--twee kiddy humor, Lewis Carrollesque surrealism, searing folk-blues, Eastern drones--but from a bizarre & uncompromising angle all his own.  You have to make some allowance for the spare production--it's what sets the record apart from every corny Sgt. Pepper imitation you've ever heard, but it also leaves these tracks more skeletons of the Hits that Might Have Been than real competition for better artists like the Kinks, the Beatles, the Stones or the Who.  Still, Barrett had a direct line to some brilliant & original Muse that went sadly silent due to illness and drugs.  \\"The Madcap Laughs\\" is an overlooked gem of the era that gets better with every listen.
B00008GKEG|4.0|Unlike the video \\"The Compleat Beatles\\" released years ago which gave an edited history (and edited music) of the Fab Four, the \\"Beatles Anthology\\" offers a complete history that is seen through not only the band's eyes but also prominent figures like George Martin. Also, the songs that are performed on the \\"Anthology\\" have not been reduced in time so one can enjoy the whole rendition.
0064471837|5.0|Nix does a fantastic job of worldbuilding. This story is of Sabriel as a young girl, confronting an ultimate evil and finding her place as Abhorsen, the one person with the power to walk within the gates of death to make sure that the dead stay there.<br />Nix's concept of two very different worlds separated by only a wall is intriguing. To the South, a 1950's-style world as we know it continues; cars and radios, schools and governments... North of the Wall, technology is useless. Magic is real, and the dead often roam--the products of rogue freemages bent on destruction. When the scattered and disorganized attacks begin to become more concentrated and deadly, Sabriel's father begins to suspect a greater force at work. In the process of his research, he disappears.<br />I highly recommend this trilogy--Sabriel, Lirael, and Abhorsen-- not only to anyone who enjoys fantasy, but anyone who appreciates literature in general. Nix's work is intelligent, his characters deep, and his stories many-threaded.<br />I also recommend visiting Garth Nix's own homepage. He writes and  updates it himself. You'l get a glimpse into the entertaining mind of a very funny and clever man....
B00005T30L|5.0|Ghost World isn't at all like what I expected after reading the back of the box, but in it's own way it was still very good. It was listed as a \\"comedy,\\" and while it has funny moments, it's really a rather serious movie.<br />The movie wasn't overly predictable, which wasa  welcome change over most of Hollywood these days; the ending was neither terriblly happy nor terriblly sad, and I think it fit well with the nature of the movie.<br />I think the fact that I could relate to the main character helped me enjoy the movie, but even if you're not a loser who's almost completely alienated from her peers you will probably still enjoy or at least respect this film.
B000002UA0|5.0|I never really liked Pink Floyd, but this album isn't really Pink Floyd's.  It's Syd Barrett's, and without a doubt his best.  Barrett gave psychedelia a uniquely English twist, rooting his music in childhood memories, Victorian lit and an art school passion for American rhythm &amp; blues in a way that parallels, without really imitating, the Beatles.  Barrett wasn't a genius, but one of those quirky, original talents that doesn't sound quite like anyone else.  'Bike', 'Astronomy Domine,' 'Lucifer Sam' and 'Flaming' aren't really songs in the conventional sense;  they're backing riffs for his naïve, strangely compelling high school-journal poetry.  And of course his most famous riff, 'Interstellar Overdrive,' is one for the ages.  I've nearly burned a hole through my CD since I got this.  If you've got even the slightest interest in Sixties music, I bet you will too.
0783226063|1.0|David Lynch's dune is a monumental mess.  The novel's fabulous story is now incomprehensible, and the film's poor editing and unwise choice of scenes to adapt makes the film feel choppy and unfocused.  The special effects are terrible, the idea of a weirding module is hilariously bad, and the battle scenes are so poorly filmed, you'd think you were watching an Italian spaghetti western (actually, it's arguable action scenes in those were better).  So see the 2000 sci-fi channel rendition instead, which unfolds in a captivating, enthralling manner.
B00005JM93|4.0|I am a huge Vincent Cassel fan, and have been since I saw him in \\"La Heine\\" several years back.  I decided to check out \\"Irreversible,\\"  though I heard it was intensely violent and at times gruesome, only because I think Cassel is one of the best actors out there.  I can only say that this was the most stunning film I have ever seen.  Not only did I bawl throughout several of the scenes, but I was gripping at my sides, closing my eyes, etc, etc.  I saw the movie about a week ago, and even now there are images from the film flashing in my head.  The movie is incredibly violent.  A couple of people have said that some of the violence looks fake, but to me, it is the most realistic violence I have seen in any film.  I was amazed and simulteanously disgusted.  \\"Irrevesible\\" is the kind of movie that I thought was horribly devestating and wonderfully good at the same time.  It really had a lasting effect on me.  What is impressive about the movie is it's realism.  The majority of the movie is completely improvised, it is shot in real lighting.  These realistic aspects make it more devestating.  The acting was amazing.  I am always impressed by Vincent Cassel, and he just keeps doing wonderfully. Best film I have seen in awhile.
B000089CJI|4.0|A great cd filled with eletronic extacy. It is what is new and original, soaring vocals of DCFC's Ben G, and a wild attack of drum machines, and synth basses.
B00005B36H|5.0|Yep, this album kicks ...! Tool really prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they're capable of producing some very strange music that's engrossing and rocks the socks - all at once!!!! No obvious singles on this cd (Shizm was a surprising choice). Best songs are The Grudge (best song on cd... jaw dropping drums!), The Patient, Schizm, Parabol&Parabola, Ticks&Leeches and Lateralus. My favorite CD at the moment.. I just wish more bands were as good as Tool :)... ooh well
0140189378|4.0|\\"Seize the Day\\" is a sad little novel about a man, lost in the wilderness of his life, whose struggle \\"toward the consummation of his heart's ultimate need\\" can succeed only when he surrenders his composure to his deepest emotions, that secret place in all of us from which we beckon our tears.  The one day in which the entire novel takes place completely encapsulates his past, present, and future into the portrait of a man mired in his environment.<br />The man is 44-year-old Tommy Wilhelm who, like some of Bellow's other fictional protagonists Augie March, Eugene Henderson, and Moses Herzog, is a little piece of the chaos of twentieth-century urban America distilled into a single confused character.  Wilhelm is a native New Yorker (although it's obvious his author is not), a failed actor, and an unemployed former sales executive.  He is separated from his wife, who is always selfishly demanding from him money that he doesn't have, and his two sons.  His only financial support now is from his father, a successful physician who is annoyed by his son's lack of discipline but nevertheless brags about his past accomplishments to anyone who will listen.<br />Wilhelm has a friend named Dr. Tamkin who professes to be a psychologist, has many various interests but dubious talents, and persuades him to invest his last dollar in lard commodities.  Tamkin, a world traveler, has told Wilhelm that he \\"had attended some of the Egyptian royal family as a psychiatrist,\\" a statement that evokes an image of the biblical Joseph prophesying for the Pharaoh seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine; but Tamkin's optimistic expectation for lard is all profit, no loss.  His philosophy is that the future is not worth the worry; live for the \\"here-and-now\\": seize the day.  He is undoubtedly a charlatan, but in Wilhelm's eyes he means well.<br />One of the novel's themes is atonement, which is signified by the reference to Yom Kippur.  Wilhelm is not very religious and has notplanned to attend a synagogue, but he recognizes the importance of saying Yiskor for his dead mother; his sincere but idle threat to the unknown hoodlums who vandalized the bench next to her grave will not suffice to honor her memory.  Ironically, the place where he ultimately atones is the funeral of a man who is evidently not Jewish (open casket, presence of flowers) -- and he weeps with the knowledge that death is all we achieve from life.  Seize the day, indeed.

B00005UW9T|5.0|&quot;Anastasia&quot; is the best animated movie release by 20th Century Fox, hands down.  It's a great movie, up there with the 90's releases by Disney.  I really love this movie.  It has great, memorable characters, and &quot;Once Upon a December&quot; is a beautiful song.  The other songs are great, which I have them all memorized.  I purchased this movie a while ago for my sister, for her birthday, but in all actuality, it was for me.  It's such a funny, and lovable movie, it's by far on my top ten favorite animated movie list.
B00005R62N|5.0|Every time I listen to this album, I get goosebumps.<BR>Who cares if Rob Halford rerecorded his vocal tracks; who else could sound that incredible, live or in a studio?<BR>These guys helped write the book of hard rock, and everyone who came after them owes something to them.<BR>These musicians had it all: chops; tone; attitude; production; songwriting; and most of all, solid gold BALLS.<BR>These guys are pure rock 'n roll.<BR>Hats off to them.  This record shows a band in the form of a spitshined battalion on parade, with guitars, sex, and rock n' roll in lieu of bullets, as it should be. <BR>FIVE BIG STARS!!!

B00003CXB2|5.0|As Stephen Spielberg says in his interview on this disc, they will never make another movie like it.  It took two years to film, involved thousands of extras and even the construction of an entire city.  This is the version to own, even though the movie is split across two discs compared to the new one-disc edition.  The reason it was split it to allow for the highest sound and picture quality available.<br />The movie was restored by legendary film preservationist Richard Harris and this is probably as good a transfer as can be done for the DVD ....  It comes with a documentary and the aforementioned Spielberg interview.<br />Not that those are necessary.  This is the greatest epic film not just because of the sheer manpower involved in making it but also because of a subtle and magnificent script by playwright Robert Bolt, legendary performances by young Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif, and mind-blowing direction by David Lean.  It ranked #5 in the AFI (American Film Institute) poll.  I would rank it #1.
B000021YQV|5.0|A great fast, furious, bouncy cd. Heres a discription on each track.<br />1.PRISON SONG: A great political song aiming at the prison systems in america. A great song to start the album with and this is one of the most fast paced song on the album. 10/10<br />2.NEEDLES: Starts out very heavy after the intro, and has a great bridge in the middle where daron malakian(guitarist) pops out and says \\"im sitting in my room with a needle in my hand\\". All in all great song. 10/10<br />3.DEER DANCE: The topic of this song is similair to prison song, any way starts out with a soft intro and soft talking, and then once it comes to the chorus you hear them yelling. 10/10<br />4.JET PILOT: The intro starts out with them just yelling. This is propbably one of the heaviest songs on the album, and one of the worst. Its just to repetitive on the lyrics. Nothing special, move on. 6/10<br />5.X(multiply): A nice intro, and then there comes them yelling. This song is similair to jet pilot in that its repetive and fairly heavy, but i think this song is better. This song makes me picture a riot!!! 9/10<br />6.CHOPSUEY: Nice intro which finishes with serj tankian(singer) yelling a word , then pausing and then talking very very fast. This song is still their crowd pleasers at concerts and is a well known clasic rock song. 10/10<br />7.BOUNCE: Similair to X, seeming it goes for basically the same time, though this song is way less political. This is a fairly heavy song which starts off with Serj(singer) yelling bounce, up, down, pogo, bounce. I think this song is about an orgy or somethin. 8/10<br />8.FOREST: The long lasting song for system of a down at about 4 minutes. Any way this is a medium pace song for system of a down, with good guitar riffs after the intro. I think this an anti religion song. This song really grew on me. 10/10<br />9.ATWA: A very slow song for system of a down. Starts off with sad kinda music and then in the chorus without warning you serj pops out and says in his fast talk you don't care about how i feel. All in all great song a little overated by their fans but not bad. 9/10<br />10.Science: This song starts out with an excellent guitar intro and then serj comes out and speaks very fast. This song has the best guitar riffs in the whole album and i love the bridge in the middle when arto takes over and you hear mid eastern music. Really cool song, could be a bit less repetitive but that won't stop it from being a ten over ten. 10/10<br />11.Shimmy: A very strange wacky song. Even for system of a down its strange. The song starts with a guitar intro and then ends with serj speaking exstremely fast. Very strange song with a great bridge in the middle with some banjo in the back ground or some wierd instrument. All in all strange song, worth a listen. 8/10<br />12.TOXICITY: Yes this is a song talking about city life and its poison. This song starts out with sad music played on the guitar, and the intro then ends with a kinda bang an then serj tankian comes out and sings softly and sadly and he then gets more vicious as he gets closer to the chorus. Excellent song i can see why this was their seconde single, and yes this too is one of their crowd pleasers. 10/10<br />13.PHYSCHO: Another strange song though not as strange as shimmy. This is propbably one of the bounciest songs i have ever heard. I think this song is talking about cocaine groupies. All in all good song. 8/10<br />14.AERIALS: Similair to toxicity though not as good as toxicity. This song starts with slow creepy music and then as the intro is about to finish it gets more quicker and less creepier. Im not sure if this is true but i think this song is talking about greed because in a sentence it says \\"life is a waterfall we drink from a river and then we go around and build up our walls\\" which i think represents greed. All in all good song. 9/10<br />15.ARTO: Just a track with mid eastern music no talking, and i think it is a good idea they put his track on the album because it really settles me down from jumping all over the place. Yes this album is very bouncy and fun to listen to.
B000022TSH|4.0|The picture and sound are decent, but this disc lacks the extras that might make it great.  Chinatown's legendary screenplay by Robert Towne was brought to life by director Roman Polanski and producer Robert Evans, all of them feuding famously.  The script went through several different drafts, with radically different endings.  It would be nice to have the screenplays included and Towne or Polanski (or even Jack Nicholson) talk about all the behind-the-scenes harangues.  The mild interviews we do get are worthless.  But that's just me wishing out loud.  If MGM's DVD production people where here they'd tell me: &quot;Forget it John, it's 'Chinatown.'&quot;
B00005YW4H|3.0|Y'all know the story by now - a formerly overlooked talent springing up out of nowhere, winning a heaping armful of Grammys and restoring a nation's faith in the art of true music. Well, not quite - this is more of a \\"right place at the right time\\" story than a \\"phenomenal young talent\\" story. She deserves some praise for producing a pleasant trinket of a debut that's widely accessible & enjoyable, but.. well, that's it. She didn't deserve  any Grammy for this. She's far from the most original or talented artist out there. She's hardly a rarity. Seeing some of the reviews Come Away With Me gets here depresses me; it's not just that so many people write it off as \\"boring\\" because it's easy and low-key (a big mistake), but also that so many others see it as an isolated breath of fresh air in the music scene, as if there weren't already hundreds of others just as accomplished out there (just as big a mistake). Sigh.<br /><br />To its credit Come Away is excellently performed, skillfully arranged/produced and willing to toe a boundary or two. Norah has a beautiful voice that's hard to stop listening to. The songs are.. average, but given a pleasantly smoky feel that's soothing to the ears. She seems on her way to eventually following in the footsteps of Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday or possibly Diana Krall, although I don't hear any jazz here - this is smooth glossy pop instead with just a slight hint of jazz and country.<br /><br />I hear some nice potential in what Norah Jones, Jesse Harris, Arif Mardin, the musical sidemen and the Blue Note marketing machine have done (I have to mention them all since the others are equally, if not more, responsible than Norah for making CAwM what it is). I have a feeling that in five or ten years I'll be buying her albums for keeps and treasuring them, but let's keep things in perspective. Underneath the hype this is merely a stepping stone to a future career of possible greatness. In itself it's light, fluffy and undistinguished.. enjoyable but ultimately disposable.ultimately disposable.
B000089RVX|5.0|OooOooO my goodness ~ WOW!!!  That is all I can really say to generalize this phenomenal piece of artwork.  This is not just regular, average music!  When first hearing the single \\"Bring me to Life\\", I was attracted, to say the least, but I had no idea what was to come from Evanescence and their deput album, \\"Fallen\\".  I am a die-hard music fan who enjoys just about every genre given, from popular music, to different types of ROCK:  (i.e. soft, alternative, punk, metal), I even listen to country, hip-hop, classical and movie scores.  That's just one reason so many people love Evanescence, because you can get whatever you want out of it.  It's like Linkin Park meets Sarah McLauglin.  Singer Amy Lee has a very pure, angelic voice with power-charged range proving not only hypnotic, but full of emotion.  Her lyrics, movingly deep and poetic.  When you can \\"feel\\" the pain and joy in someone's voice, that is when you know it's good.  Some songs are quite chilling, others are absolutely breathtaking!  On the CD you will find mixed in sounds of alternative rock, vocal harmonies, an eccentric blend of of beat rhythms, snyths, strings, piano, underlying vocals, you name it!  It's stylish, comtemporary and something totally new that I have been waiting a long time for!!!  Hopefully my review will help convey the brilliance of this album.  Then again... you could just look at every other review and take note of the mass response!  Well, Happy Listening!:)
B00004XQ83|5.0|One of my favorite soundtracks, &quot;O Brother&quot; is filled with a broad variety of bluegrass, blues and gospel songs that give one a taste of the best, well, not &quot;country&quot; but perhaps &quot;rural&quot; American music of the era.  Incredibly authentic--it feels very right.
0393312836|4.0|I found Anthony Burgess's book to be very strange. The complex Russian slang (Nasdat) that was used in the book was very annoying at some parts but was also a very interesting technique used by the author to keep you very interested and locked in to what you are reading. Alex, the main character, and his droog friends were wreaking havoc during the night, also drinking milk that was spiked with hallucinogenic drugs. Eventually the cops caught up with the boy and he was the focus in an experimental punishment used by the government. He was sat down and forced to watch many horrible things in history. The hope was that after seeing all this horror, Alex would be so incredibly sickened that his crime days would be put to an end and he would be a much better citizen. Burgess really keeps you interested through out the entire book with some very clever language.<BR> There is an extremely high level of violence used through out the book. In my mind the violence is used for an extremely important reason. The way Burgess pounds the violence in to you, describing every detail, you begin to get a great idea of what this book exactly means. All of his ideas and points in the story are bashed into you when you hear about these nasty minor things that many other authors would leave out. The more you read, the more intrigued you are to find out why these boys could do such sick and disgusting things and just what punishment will be laid on them if any punishment will. All in all I was extremely pleased with what I got out of A Clockwork Orange. I would highly recommend the book to anyone with an interest in sci-fi.
0802130208|5.0|Ignatius J. Reilly, the over sized hero of John Kennedy's Toole's Confederacy Of Dunces, is a modern day Don Quixote of  the French Quarter. Is Ignatius a dead beat or a genius? The reader is never sure. The plot revolves around his various attempts to hold jobs while living at home with his increasingly suspicious mother. The book's episodic events explode one after the other like fire works.  Every line of dialogue is perfectly hilarious. Indeed, the entire story delights in the reverabations of  It's voices. An array of strange charcters, each with his or her own personal agenda regarding Ignatius, parade through the story.  Kennedy's greatest creation is the mother of Ignatius, Mrs. Reilly. A woman determined to see her son make good. Kennedy has rendered The banter between mother and son in such a way so as to be both full of pathos and heart  breakingly funny. Confederacy Of Dunces is an underappreicated great American novel...
B00004Z4TT|5.0|My title says it all. Most movies are predictable but there is no way you can see where this one's headed. I felt I had received my money's worth after the first five minutes..just from watching the puppet's do the Dance of Despair.<br />This is a classic.
0316666343|4.0|At times it's disturbing; at others, compelling.  In any event, this book is worth the time it takes to read it.  I can't imagine how I would behave in a situation like this, so the  characters' behavior neither shocked nor surprised me. I was particularly drawn to the character of the father who needs so desperately to find evidence to catch his daughter's killer, as well as the brave younger sister who aligns herself with her father in trying to prove the killer's true identity.  All in all, this is a fascinating read and despite the various chinks in its armor you might find along the way, a book well worth reading.
B000005RMY|5.0|It is great knowing this collection of great 12&quot;s is available. The original imports I am using are overworked.<br />Great for SOM fans! Or, new SOM fans........
B00002613K|4.0|Magnum's \\"Vigilante\\" is their most commercial sounding album, and it might as well be their finest effort ever. Some would say it's time typical and some will say that it has little in common with the early Magnum. Well, that might be the case but the fact is that this album is very good - strong material, well performed and well produced. Magnum deliver quality rock with a lot of melody from the start to the end. You get rockers as well as ballads, and Magnum have not included a single filler on this solid album. Highly recommended!
038572179X|2.0|I must agree with the previous reviewer...it was pure torture.  I stayed with it only because of so many glowing reviews, saying to myself, &quot;The good part is just around the corner.&quot;  It never came.
B00000BKDW|3.0|After Iron Maiden's overall best release \\"Piece of mind\\", things started to go downhill. On the one hand, \\"Powerslave\\" includes some really great songs like the opener \\"Aces high\\" - a fast rocker about pilots during World War II; The slower but very captivating title track \\"Powerslave\\", and the ending 13 minutes (?) long \\"Rime of the ancient mariner\\" which is built the same way as \\"Hallowed be thy name\\" (from \\"The number of the beast\\") with it's interesting changes in tempo. Steve Harris have revisited this formula several times later but in my opinion he have never been able to come up with something that's not a (pale) copy. These 3 songs are the albums highlight. Then there's two average songs: \\"2 minutes to midnight\\" and \\"Back in the village\\", but the rest is not good at all.
B000067CPX|5.0|I think it's unfair of all the funk guys who gave this CD one star just 'cause it's melodic. Well good. The Chili peppers have put out plenty of funk in their career, so can you blame them for wanting to look at different directions after like twenty years? To try to put them back in the past would be a waste of the now- that music has been made for all to enjoy, now let them make new music. Apparently some people just want them to churn out endless clones of BSSM. Anyways I think this CD is the best realization of their potential yet, it's an unbelievable album. Even moreso than Californication, every track is memorable, distinct, tuneful, and beautiful. Amazing guitar work by John, awesome use of background vocals, great melodies- every song on this album has it all, and each one has its own identity. The Chili Peppers have evolved into something far greater, and as far as I am concerned, in this era of music, they are untouchable.
B000001F27|4.0|When Joe Lynn Turned came onboard, Rainbow's approach really changed into a lighter and more commercial hard rock style (even `tho the previous \\"Down to earth\\" sure had some light moments). \\"Difficult to cure\\" is a very good album even `tho I prefer the Ronnie James Dio-era, and it's absolutely better than the following \\"Straight between the eyes\\". On this album you get to hear the amazing \\"Spotlight kid\\" (just listen to the excellent solo part), the radio friendly tracks \\"I surrender\\", \\"No magic\\", \\"Freedom fighter\\" and \\"Can't happen here\\". You are also in for some classical music, since the band is doing a cover (?) of Beethoven's nine symphony. All aspects included, this is a solid rock effort worth having!
B00005JKG7|5.0|After owning numerous copies on VHS, I bought the DVD, and wasn't dissapointed. This is as good as it gets. Carpenter manages to tell the traditional ghost story with such feeling and atmosphere, to this day I haven't seen another film like it. Pure Genius.
B00000K31Q|4.0|Total teenie chick flick movie, but as a guy I found it surprisingly very fun to watch.  This one proudly goes in my DVD collection and is definitely a must watch.
B00008977N|4.0|I was ecstatic to find this finally released on dvd. As we all know the concert itself is absolutely phenominal, for those who attended this tour and/or bought the vhs tape well know. But, there's good news and bad news about this dvd. The good news is that the audio is impeccable, it sounds fantastic, a marked improvement over the video tape. The bad news is that the video is horrible! All grainy and it actually looks worse than the tape. I am totally shocked by this. With all the technology today didn't anyone care when they decided to release this on dvd to IMPROVE the video quality? It does look bad, there's no other way to put it. With the cool extras that were added, like the &quot;making of&quot; and the added teasers for the Growing Up Tour, this is a fun package to own. Juse the video quality is a letdown, which is why I didn't give this the 5 stars that it should have, so be warned.
B000068TPN|4.0|Very emotional movie, likely to make any guy or girl tear up a bit.  This movie is no award winner -- the storyline is filled with holes.  The first hour or so extremely boring, almost cheesy.  However, the war scenes is very intense.  I find it somewhat absurd that the US lost about 60 people, while the Vietnamese lost 1800 ..  and yet, the movie seemed like the US was getting slaughtered.  You will literally see each one of those 60 people die and pour a river of blood.  Overall, it is a worthy rental or a borderline \\"to-own\\" DVD.
B00006LLNV|5.0|I have seen the movie twice now, and during the second viewing I got to really listen to the musical background.  It truly deserved the recognition of the Grammy Award  The songs capture the tempestuous life of Frida Kahlo........the passion, the darkness, and the pain.  Some very old mexican ranchera standards, included in the track, brought back memories of mi familia, and the emotion of Mexico during Kahlo's life.
B00007ELEL|5.0|this movie is my mantra.  after seeing this movie thousands of times my friends and i got obsessed with bowling, and we can recite any line from the movie.  sarcastically funny, witty, smart.  you really have to pay attention, even though there is no real direction that you're headed in.  <BR>this is definitely in my top 10 movies of all time list
B00005V1Z0|4.0|This movie was pretty good but it was a little too short! I can't wait till Tomb Raider 2: The Cradle of Life comes out in July! I would definitely give more than 1 star! That is just stupid! It was one of the most decent action films I've seen in years! It is better than Congo, Dante's Peak, The Lost Boys and Lost In Space! I don't care what you'll think but I loved it!
0790744295|4.0|Rather than attempt to avoid charges of cheesiness, Creepshow embraces such a characterization, patterning itself openly on the old E.C. horror comics of the 1950s, those delightful horror-filled books of illustrated wonder which the horror-phobic among the general population brought down with their baseless charges of fragile little mind corruption.  The movie is framed around a modern-day father who all but thrashes his son for having brought a Creepshow comic book into the house.  Out in the trash the comic book goes, where an animated horror-meister and a cooperative set of wind gusts take us through its pages of old-style, campy spooks and scares.  Each of the five stories making up the bulk of this movie are delivered in the form of a cinematic comic book, with the opening and closing of each tale of terror literally presented inside the type of illustrated frame found therein.  Each of the stories is good but perhaps not great, enjoyable but not overly exciting.  Among a cast of several big-name actors, a certain fellow from Maine comes close to stealing the show.<br /><br />In Father's Day, you have your basic decayed dead body crawling up out of the grave to demand the final wish denied him in his final moments of life.  This is really the most stereotypical of the five vignettes, although it does offer a modern example of hideousness in the form of Ed Harris dancing.  Next up is The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill, wherein a half-wit of sorts discovers that meteorites from the heavens bring with them something more than the prospect of a couple of hundred bucks from the university science department.  This story could easily be called It Grows on You.  Playing the part of Jordy is none other than Stephen King himself, and I believe he gives a rather remarkable performance.  The role doesn't exactly call for the world's greatest actor, but King definitely exhibits some natural acting skills in this unprecedented extended foray before the cameras.  Something To Tide You Over is pretty good, casting Leslie Nielsen as the jealous husband intent on teaching his wife and her lover (Ted Danson) a thing or two about threatening to take away one of his possessions.  It's rather predictable, but the unusual nature of the jealous husband's revenge is fun to watch.  The Crate is the best of these five stories in my opinion.  The action revolves around the discovery of a 150-year old crate inside a university science building.  The janitor who finds it is the first to discover the importance of its contents, although he quickly finds himself in no condition to communicate the discovery should he wish to do so.  The professor who watches the scene in horror is severely traumatized and runs off to seek the aid and comfort of a friend.  One man's nightmare is another man's gain, as Hal Holbrook's hen-pecked character proves.  Of course, what would a Creepshow be without bugs?  The fifth story provides cockroaches in legions, much to the horror of a hard-nosed, germ-paranoid, bug-hating businessman.  Sure, the man's got a problem interacting with his fellow man, but the hard lesson he learns is a little bit extreme.  Bug-haters should be forewarned about the content of this story as it is literally crawling with bugs.<br /><br />Creepshow is the brainchild of modern horror master Stephen King and well-known horror director George Romero.  The format and unique style of presentation of this movie are impressively campy, and the manner in which the stories are introduced is very effective.  Creepshow comes as close as humanly possible to becoming a video comic book.  Its faithfulness to and nostalgia for E.C. Comics are quite satisfying to those of us whose disdain for would-be censors of such material knows no bounds.  Those who would criticize the campiness of this horror film would probably have a hard time understanding that such charges are, in this particular case, indications of success rather than failure.  If you like your crypts emptied of animated corpses, your meteors filled with a substance much more significant than metals of different sorts, and your murders conducted with the type of unusual flare that shows how much the perpetrator really cares, Creepshow is a movie that can definitely entertain you.nimated corpses, your meteors filled with a substance much more significant than metals of different sorts, and your murders conducted with the type of unusual flare that shows how much the perpetrator really cares, Creepshow is a movie that can definitely entertain you.
B000002H2H|4.0|&quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; is an awesome album. It is an album where Metallica still wanted to crush the world, and not become teen idols. The whole album is fantasic.
0786915749|4.0|The DragonLance saga is one of the most prolific in fantasy, with scores of prequels and sequels and offshoots and imitators.  The DragonLance Chronicles is the series that started it all.  To call it anything less than a classic would be sacrilegious.  Deeply rooted in the mythos of Tolkien and heavily influenced by the rules and mechanics of the RPG world, the DragonLance Chronicles manages to create a vast high-fantasy universe with few equals then or since.  Dragons of Autumn Twilight has many rough edges, typical for a first book in a series, but it fulfills its role admirably and paves the way for a crescendo in the second and third book.<br />All of the main characters are introduced very early on.  In fact, most of them already know each other.  Five life-long friends agree to reunite after a long separation.  There's Tanis Half-Elven, the mongrel who serves as the group's de facto leader.  Raistlin Majere is the creepy mage who recently underwent a disturbing transformation, physical and possibly much more; his twin, the warrior Caramon, is a gentle giant who's somewhat simple-minded but unswervingly faithful.  Sturm Brightblade is an austere paladin seeking to attain knighthood and restore honor to his family and to the disgraced Knighs of Solamnia.  Flint Fireforge is an old, hot-tempered dwarf who, despite his gruff demeanor, considers the others his only family.  Rounding out the company is Tasslehoff Burrfoot, a lovable kender who bubbles with curiosity and loves to lay his hands on other people's belongings.  It was a troubled time, with news of war abroad and disturbing rumors of strange creatures walking the lands.  Soon, the company runs into a mysterious barbarian princess and her grim escort.  She bears a staff with strange powers that soon proves to be the source of their troubles.<br />There is no lack of adventure and exotic locales.  The party finds themselves whisked on one fantastic, and deadly, journey after another.  They will have traveled from the tree city Solace to Darken Wood, never before seen by living eyes, to the legendary ruined city Xak Tsaroth,  where black wings of death reign, to the secret elven city Qualinost, with its slender and graceful spires, to the long abandoned fortress Pax Tharkas, now teeming with sinister forces.  Strange, fantastic creatures hinder and aid their journey, and rumors have it that dragons have returned out of legends to spread destruction across the lands.<br />The main characters scream \\"stereotypes\\".  But remember that this book was one of the first, so such accusation would be unfair.  Tanis is a conflicted protagonist, tortured by the passions of his human heritage and the aloofness and passivity of his elven heritage.  He's also torn between his desire for the tempestuous human warrior Kitiara and his love for the sweet but inexperienced elfmaiden Laurana.  The others seem somewhat one-dimensional.  Caramon is unfailingly obsequious to his brother, Sturm unbendingly upholds his ideals of honor and chilvalry, Riverwind is always grim, Goldmoon has boundless compassions, Flint is deathly afraid of boats, the seemingly evil Raistlin spouts one foreboding comment after another, in between in bouts of racking coughs.  It seems Raistlin does little else; we know he's sorely bothered by his coughs, can we just move on?  Raistlin would become the focus for later books, but I must admit I do not find him very interesting in this book, even though among the group he has the most potential for intrigue.  My favorite character is Tas.  Despite obviously being the comic relief, his ofttimes silly little adventures are quite funny.  I love his exchanges with Flint, who never quite carries out his threat to throttle the lovable kender.  He has a lot of Bilbo Baggins in him.<br />The first part of the book up until Xak Tsaroth is as good as it gets.  The mood is evil and foreboding and the reader has no idea what to expect.  The first encounter with the draconians gives the impression that they are mysterious, deadly, and very hard to defeat.  However, after the meeting with the gully dwarves, the book takes an abrupt turn and becomes... comical.  The fight scenes in Xak Tsaroth are light-hearted, almost slapstick-like.  The draconians proceed to lose most of their fearsome aura and become no more than your average goons.  I'm also not sure if the whole treatment of the gully dwarves in Xak Tsaroth are supposed to be comic relief or not.  If so, it ruins the mood of one of the more exciting sections of the book.  I'm also dismayed by the lack of fighting prowess of the characters.  The humans are fair enough fighters, but despite his age and experience, Flint is virtually a liability in battle.  Raistlin is capable of casting only a few noneffectual spells before he tires and has to rest.  The elflords too are rather weak and easily defeated.  And everyone is so susceptible to magical attacks that they can be easily disabled.  I suppose, like in an RPG, the party gain power as they gain experience.  Still, this is a novel, not a game.  Given their adventuring experience, the characters should have more martial prowess than they are given credit for.<br />The authors have shown a lot of imagination in bring to life the many ruins and dungeons the party has to explore.  However, many adventures seem to be rushed, as if the authors are trying to cram as many as possible into the book.  For one thing, I would've liked to learn more about Xak Tsaroth, Qualinost, or the dungeons of Sla-Mori.  The descriptions are too brief and fail bring out all the grandeur and mystery the idea of these places can inspire in the reader.<br />Overall, the book has a great beginning, a so-so middle, and a good ending.  The way is paved for the next installment of the series, a masterpiece!  So get this one out of the way and get started on Dragons of Winter Night.
B00002Z88D|3.0|I'll admit that I couldn't wait to hear this album, I am one who looks for something different in music. Although the concept was good, the quality is bad. I would have liked to see this album around 1988/89 time frame when Metallica was still &quot;metal&quot;. I think the effect that they were trying would have been much better. But with Metallica's slower tempo and lacking vocals it leaves alot to be desired.
B00005Y228|1.0|Kylie has proven this to be true: Simply buy an old Ace Of Base CD, put it on repeat, and record that and yourself singing \\"Itsss Luuuuooove at First Sight\\" over and over again until blood runs from your ears. Added points if you look good in a tube top and lycra pants (or less) and don't forget to sing in a tone that 14 year-olds can emulate. You will be a hit in no time!<br />Listen kiddies: There is dance/house music out there that is 1000% better than this regurgitated disco garbage (Faithless, Cassius, Air, Thievery Corporation, LTJ Bukem, EBTG, etc.....), so why don't you spent your hard begged allowances on something that you can be proud of; don't be a tool of the record companies and demand decent music made by performers who care more about the music than how they look in their lame videos, and are not created in some marketing agency.<br />Demand more and you will get it...
B00005B36H|4.0|This is yet another great album from a great band. Tool continues to impress me with their writing. Although all of their albums are awesome, I think this is their best album to date. If I could only suggest one of Tools albums this would be it. Tool is one of the few bands they play on the radio that is good at what they do. I don't even like to compare Tool to radio bands, because Tool is on a totaly different level.
0790731452|4.0|Spotty satire of 1950s sci-fi (among other things) is enlivened by a nasty streak of misanthropy as well as a witty score by Danny Elfman.  Hilarious when it's \\"on,\\" and at least visually interesting when it's \\"off,\\" this film probably deserved its critical drubbing and box-office failure.  I thought it was one of the best of its year anyway -- one of a mere handful of films from the past decade that can still make me laugh like a maniac.    If you like cult movies, you should see this one.  All the same, rent before you buy.
B000002HMH|2.0|I bought this album when it first came out, and I had to check the cover to make sure it said Metallica. Although I didn't expect another &quot;Puppets&quot; record, I thought that they'd atleast try. As a metal fan I wouldn't suggest it,I will say that for those radio happy fans should appreciate the hard rock style.
B000063US7|3.0|When I took a look to the presentation, and the comments about this DVD, I said, Ok I must have this DVD for my collection.<BR>For me, a fan of all the Genesis' periods, is the first time to have a concert with DVD image and sound quality.<BR>Wow, as \\"The musical box\\" said: \\"Ive been waiting here for so long, and all this time has pass me by....\\"<BR>Ok, I have the DVD in my own hands, lets go to play it!!!!<BR>Great!! Excellent intro, well done.<BR>The menu is very complete, the \\"Invisible Touch\\" of a fan!!<BR>Ok, press play...<BR>Oh, oh... my god, what is this???<BR>Ive never seen a worst image quality.<BR>Its seems that a little boy has encoded the video with the book \\"Video for dummies\\" at a side.<BR>Really I cant believe that Phil Collins, or others members of the band allows to somebody to sell a video with this \\"disrespecting\\" quality.<BR>Ok its great to play with 4 cameras at the time, and the sound remix its ok.<BR>I never seen a concert recorded complete four times at the same time, that the reason to rate this DVD with 3 stars.<BR>Ok , I now that the physical space of a DVD is limited and the decision was to leave the four cameras intacts.<BR>Its impossible to fit 4 hours of video in every DVD without loosing quality.<BR>The bitrate of the video never exceeds 2000 Kbps, and for all the people who knows what is this, you know that this is simillar to a Super Video CD.<BR>A wrong desicion regardless quality.... really, what a shame.
B000002H33|5.0|This is the last great album from what we though of Metallica. Metallica's first three albums should be considered classics. This is Metallica at the top of their game, when metal meant something to them. Although this lineup wasn't as good as the orginal crew, they made the album nobody else could at the time.
B00005RY7X|4.0|On my scale I give this about 6.8, 7.0 out of 10! the music is cool, it's kind of like Poison mixed with Pink. The lyrics sound like they were written by a guy who likes to drink alot and party til the night ends. This CD is okay, but it takes a while to like it. If you like 80's glam rock, then get this!
B000002H97|3.0|This was my last hope for Metallica. &quot;And Justice for All&quot; left something lacking in their music, little did I know at the time that is was a turning point in their music. This is a good metal album for teens, but is very poor for anyone looking for musical and lyrical content. The black album is where Metallica when from metal to hard rock.If you want a good commercial metal album from the '91 era, buy Megadeth-Countdown to Extinction you'll be glad you did.
0446677450|3.0|I thought the way Kiyosaki laid out his plan for financial sucsess was interesting, telling of his own personal experiences and his &quot;rich and poor dad.&quot;  Kiyosaki's notion that not everyone is doomed to be a participant in the &quot;rat race&quot; was motivating and showed that you don't have to have a thousand degrees to become financialy successful.  I thought that his emphasis on the importance of financial eduation was a good one, showing that although there are many highly educated people, their financial skills are poor.  I think one of the things that was most stressed was the difference between a liablity that many think to be an asset.  Also, Kiyosaki stressed that it takes a long period of time to make money.  For example, stocks are a long term investment that will make money over time.  I also liked the idea of getting money to work for you instead of you being a slave to money.  However, I did find the book to be repetitive and stating nothing more than common sense.  I also found that Kiyosaki was sometimes critical of the middle calsses painting them to be robots unable to think for themselves. However, Kiyosaki's want for the middle class to better themselves is a start on the right track.
B0000634EV|4.0|I will start by saying that this album is much more toned down than &quot;Nola&quot; and I was a little disappointed at first. I could instantly hear classic rock coming out of my speakers, but then I saw them live. I don't know why they produced this the way they did, but hearing this album live it sounds just as hard as &quot;Nola&quot;. I can only guess they were buzzed while they were producing it. It is still a damn good album, there is a lot of feeling and meaning to the tracks. While you won't probably be bang'n your head, you definitly will feel this album.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|My friend recommended me to watch this movie a good while ago. Finally, after 7 other friends, I watched it. No words can describe how awesome this movie is. Brimming with symbolism, Donnie Darko is a movie which opens the viewer's eyes to fake people, friends, happiness, love. Although the viewer may not realize it, Donnie dies for the ones he loves. He dies with his own happy memories, and in dying, he saves the lives of the people who would have died otherwise. 1000 words is not enough to fully explain the beauty of this movie. Just watch it and rejoice.
B000002H6C|3.0|I see this album as the turning point for Metallica. They made this a political album, which isn't bad on the surface. But I saw it as Metallica's lean toward commercial hard rock style. This album definitly doesn't stand up to the first three. The only good thing about this album was the &quot;One&quot; video they did, which is a classic.
0345457684|5.0|Maybe the best new author I've read.  The whole books reads as fast and tight as the first pages of &quot;Snow Crash&quot; (Neil Stephenson) but has the emotional depth and personal honesty of Elmore Leonard. Like most S.F. if makes you accept a basic impossible premise, then explores the implications of that idea.  In this case, Morgan explores ALL the implications of that idea in the course of a riotous run through the future.  Morgan stays within the &quot;rules&quot; he's set up, and delivers the hardest hitting book I've read in a long time.  Oh, and a bonus, it has a real ending! (not the sort of &quot;everyone drops acid and wierd things happen&quot; kind of ending you get from Gibson).
B000002HJR|5.0|This was the begining of Phil's experimentation and it was an instant classic. &quot;Nola&quot; is one of those albums that is a one of a kind. It stands alone in metal history. Everybody in this band made this album for one reason, they love metal. I've seen these guys live and nobody has impressed me more. If you haven't heard this album, you are definitly missing out.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is a great CD if you need to relax, for a romantic evening, or have a baby that won't nap!  Norah's voice is sweet and unobtrusive, and I can't stop playing it!
B00000FCBC|3.0|The way I see this album is that, you should find a friend that likes hard rock and split the cost. Give him Disk 1 and you take Disk 2. I wouldn't pay full price for this 2 cd set because it's definitly not worth it. Disk 2 is very good, but you also have to buy Disk 1. I think is a way of showing how Metallica no longer cares about hardcore fans and just wants to make a buck. Disk 1 should have been a freebe or a different album all together. If I could I would rate Disk 2: 4 stars and Disk 1: 2 stars.
B00006J9OT|3.0|This CD is vey &quot;Jazzy&quot;; by that I mean there is a lot of piano playing and double bass, but not enough singing, in my opinion.  I don't really like the fast tempo and the piano all the time, and I think it overrides Diana Krall's beautiful voice.
B000001IQH|5.0|This album is by far the best Rancid album to date.  It is possibly one of the best punk albums I have ever heard.  Tim Armstrong's raspy vocals + Lars Frederickson's crunchy guitars + Matt Freeman's amazing bass lines, including one of the best bass solos I've ever heard (in Maxwell Murder).  If you are any kind of punk fan, this album is a must have.  <br />Best Songs: Roots Radicals; Lock, Step, and Gone; Listed MIA; The Wars End.
B0000797IO|2.0|Jennifer Anniston is one of my favorite actresses. Her portrayal of Justine, a retail clerk, bored with her job, husband, and pretty much every aspect of her life, was typical big screen Anniston, lots of eye movement, not much dialogue, same performance as Rock Star...I thought the movie was also predictable. She has an affair, up until that time was unable to get pregnant, takes a home pregnancy test, comes up pregnant, husband is elated when only prior was tested at the fertility clinic. Surprise, surprise, he gets the phone call saying he cannot have children while surrounded by friendly well-wishers who are now speechless as Anniston looks on...There were no earth-shattering moments, tepid to say the least and I found myself watching the clock waiting for it be over...
B00006LLLN|5.0|I recommend this CD because it is a well balanced selection of their best music, all the players are well represented, and the fidelity is great.<br />This acoustic kind of music lends itself to good live recording in the first place, but the clarity and mix are notably excellent.<br />Sometimes live albums are disappointing, but this one is totally satisfying.
079073639X|2.0|The first half of &quot;Sphere&quot; is top notch. The second half is weak, bland, and unexciting. The film stays true to the book, but abandons all the qualities that made is such a page-turner. Gone are the ever reaching tentacles of the squid monster; they've been replaced by a sonar blip in the shape of a squid. This is incredibly not scary. Also, the dialogue consists of our characters blandly saying things that progressively make little sense, to the point where the end is just a bunch of jumbled words. &quot;Sphere&quot; is a film that makes you feel mad at everyone involved for turning in such a weak film. It starts out so promising, then gives us very little. What a darn shame.
B00007E8O5|5.0|This CD set is awesome...a great \\"overdose\\" for those who didn't get enough with the original release of Degradation Trip.  Get ahold of it...you won't be disappointed.
B00005JKED|5.0|\\"Training Day\\" may very well be the smartest cop drama in recent history. Denzel Washington gives an Academy Award-winning performance as Alonzo, a hard-edged street cop whose specialty is narcotics. Ethan Hawke plays his rookie of the day who is fresh from training and is green in the field. The film, as the title implies, follows our characters for a day and we see Alonzo do some things we're not sure we want cops doing, such as drinking and driving, stealing money, and taking drugs. While the film's ending is highly predictable and even inevitable, it still leaves a strong impact on the audience. Denzel Washington is completely outstanding as the narcotics detective. This really is a hugely different role for him and he handles it effortlessly, putting him among other film tough-guys like DeNiro, Humphrey Bogart, Al Pacino, and Sean Connery. Washington glows on the screen, steals the show from an already-outstanding cast and flexes those acting muscles like he never has before. Some people questioned his getting the Oscar for this movie. I don't. This is the best performance so far in his career. Director Antoine Fuqua also does a splendid job in keeping the film fluid, fast, and furious. There are touches of humor mixed with scenes of violence. Very rarely does a director really flesh out the surroundings and setting the way Fuqua has done here. \\"Training Day\\" is one of the best films of 2001 and shouldn't be missed at all.
B000001EAQ|5.0|The poorly remixed POP tracks on the 2002 Best Of CD I think are making people reappreciate those tracks in their original form, and the album POP from which they came ...Only now, 6 years later, can one truly appreciate the production behind Pop, with its extreme depth and detail. This album still sounds ahead of its time now in 2003, its electronic sounds are one of a kind,no one except Edge has experimented so much with his guitar and come up with such variety of effects. Lyrically Pop seems much more relevant now than in march 1997 when it was released, and comes through as possibly their darkest most serious album, an Achtung Baby taken to its outer limits.<BR>One hint, to make it a perfect album, you can burn your own personalized copy, taking out Playboy Mansion and God's Angels (two unfulfilling songs), and replace them with the b-sides of that era, Holy Joe and I'm not your Baby, consider putting Velvet Dress as the last track...Another hint: you can ignore the remixes of many of the tracks on Pop, after carefull listen, the original Please, Discotheque, LAst night on earth, Gone, etc etc are far more interesting.
B00005JLR2|5.0|Listen up folks!<br />Treasure Planet is one of the best animation movies ever produced. It was pure fun to watch! It has action, adventure and great music. Lilo and Stitch was rude and insulting for younger kids to watch. **Treasure Planet is not.**<br />I saw it with my boys (4 and 7) at an IMAX type theater, and we had a great time!<br />THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE!
038572179X|5.0|Atonement was in the top 10 of novels I've ever read - beautiful and moving and very entertaining.
1577311523|5.0|Like any other form of self-improvement, spiritual practice, or life-altering steps, you must be in a position to accept and act out these changes.  <br />Many bash The Power of Now for not being able to understand it or not being able to practice it, and so they claim that Eckhart Tolle is just a capitalist trying to steal peoples' money by selling mumbo jumbo.  This is totally the opposite.  It is easy to understand how any person who has not read this book and understood it could come to believe that this person is a capitalist and is now living in a 3 story mansion with several exotic cars.  It's easy to imagine that, and to think negatively of someone who made a great profit off of a book since he has a lot more money than we do, but if you actually understood what your mind was doing, you would realize that you are just mindlessly defending yourself because you are in a position far inferior to him, and your mind dislikes it, so you lash out.<br />The fact is, this book is simply amazing.  I have been on different medications, on and off, and yes, SEVERAL of them have not helped at all.  I will say this: everyone needs some form of help, whether it is medicine, reading, or just time.  If someone had suggested this book to me when I first began having neurosis, I probably wouldn't have been able to accept it for truly what it's worth simply because I was in no position other than true desperation.  If you are on the brink of suicide, or your life is falling to pieces, this book will not help you experience a dramatic transformation that happened with Tolle during his life.  This book would be most beneficial if you are at an OK stage in your life, not falling apart, not great, just there, looking for more, as most of the population is.  \\"Does it get any better?\\"  Sometimes you might find yourself asking this.  If you feel like you want to die, you should seek other help, and probably medication.  If you simply CANNOT stop yourself from obsessive thought or anxiety even when you go through several well-known exercises, you probably need medication.  There is a \\"food chain\\" involved in self improvement.  At the most desperate level, people need medicine.  Once they are at a stable level to accept therapy and positive life changes, they can seek a therapist, therapy groups, and begin reading books like this.  Tolle doesn't speak much in the aspect of medicine, but from personal experience, I can tell you that medicine doesn't make you \\"not need\\" this book, but in fact simply allows you to accept it as a normal person would.  You would be able to benefit from it, and greatly improve your life.  Don't look to this book for reprieve if you are on the brink of insanity.  For most people, this book is simply hit or miss.  If you are ready to accept it, you realize its potential and how simply beautiful it is.  If you aren't, you will cast it out as a sham to take advantage of people.  It's not.<br />Alas, there is a reason I gave it five stars.  The teachings, practices, and views on life will simply begin making you into a different person, if you haven't already yourself.  As Tolle explains, most people who reach this stage have suffered greatly in their life, perhaps by the death of someone close, or by severe clinical depression.  He teaches that we are simply emotionally tormented and taken advantage of by our minds, and once we are able to \\"surrender\\" and accept where we are and this present moment, we will not be at peace with ourselves.  Have you heard of prison death-row inmates, minutes or hours before being executed, suddenly finding peace?  They are looking for a way out constantly, fearing their death more than anything else a person could ever fear, but they finally escape.  Why?  There is nothing else to do, and your Being simply gives up this fear and accepts the present moment, and you are at peace.  This does not mean giving up, it means accepting the moment, and not resisting it, nor reacting through natural emotional defense.  I could go on and on, but the book is a much better and more thorough teacher than I could ever sum up in a review.<br />Do not let emotions run your life, or your decisions, or your relationships.  \\"Respond, don't react.\\"  You will dramatically change your life by simply being more present and obsessing less, and surrendering to the moment.  You drop a plate of food, do you freak out and curse?  Do you resist?  Why??  As soon as you drop it, accept it as if it had been dropped a month ago, and simply clean it up.  It takes 10 seconds.  What is the point of that emotional upheaval we create when things like this happen?  Our life is filled with things like this.  You will make good decisions, based on a clear objective consciousness, not emotion or obsessive thoughts or fears.<br />There is simply no way someone's life could NOT be improved by reading this book.  The degree to which it happens is in the hands of the reader.  I highly recommend this book, and I have read several of its kind.  It is simply the most organized, truthful, and comprehensive of all I've read.  You will never spend 15 dollars on anything better in your life, even with global currency conversion rates.
B000003TA4|2.0|...but I just can't figure out what the big deal about this album is.  I was thirteen in 1992, and I had &quot;Nevermind&quot; like pretty much everyone my age did, but since then it's been relegated to juvenile relic status in my book.  I just don't get why so many people seem to feel obligated to praise it.  Most of the stuff on this album strikes me as little more than boring noise.  Take &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; or &quot;Lithium,&quot; both of which have somehow been elevated to classic status by the general public while I wasn't looking.  Mopey, monotone vocals in the verses, pointless yelling in the choruses, extremely uninteresting arrangements and song structures...what's so great about these songs?  What am I missing?  In the past decade I've heard SO many bands that exhibited higher levels of musicanship and songwriting ability than Nirvana that it would be pointless to list them here.  Sure, Nirvana changed the face of radio, but since radio was spinning hair bands before grunge came along, what's that tell you?  Nirvana weren't even the best of the grunge trend, for Pete's sake.  Pretty much every song on Alice In Chains's &quot;Dirt&quot; and Soundgarden's &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; and &quot;Superunknown&quot; is more creative and interesting than anything on &quot;Nevermind.&quot;  I think those who have read my reviews (and I know there are a few of you out there) know that I try really hard to be fairminded, but I just can't see the reason for the relentless praise of Nirvana.  This album gets two stars from me mainly because Dave Grohl is a great drummer, and Kurt Cobain did come up with a few halfway decent riffs.  But if I never hear this album again, I won't shed any tears.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I heard My Immortal on the Daredevil soundtrack, I knew that I had to get this album. My friend got it for me, and I fell in love with the album. I love Amy Lee's vocals and the background choirs, it really goes together. I hope that evanescence eventually will be able to perform at some award shows and win an award in the near future. I know that this group will go far, they are really talented. They are rock, and not in an all depressing way, that is what I love most of about this group. Go and by the cd!
B00003CXI0|5.0|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the best thing to hit children's literature and film for many years. It has everything it needs to be a long-lasting icon of the film industry. And yes, I say the Philosopher's Stone, not that other horrible name, because that is the true name of the book and movie. The alternate name was plastered onto the American edition because... well, I won't go into details of those rumours.<br />Suffice to say, this movie was brilliantly done. Kudoes to Chris Columbus for a magnificent job. It seems he was criticised from a number of different angles (unfairly, in my opinion) for either sticking too closely to the book, or for not including various scenes.<br />One, he couldn't have included everything. It would have been a logistical impossibility. Two, had he strayed from the story given in the book, it would have lost a lot of its magic. Pun not intended.<br />I was a little disappointed at some things being missed. In particular, Hermione's momentary panic when Harry and Ron are caught in the Devil's Snare, and the alterations to the entire 'Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback' saga. But all in all, I think it was a great effort that resulted in the sort of enjoyable movie that you can watch again and again.<br />The stars are all brilliant. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all perfect in their roles. Emma Watson in particular - she has Hermione's mannerisms down pat.<br />As for the adults, they too were all wonderful. Especially, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman. And a special mention for Tom Felton - he has really made Draco Malfoy into someone that we can love to hate.<br />The Philosopher's Stone is marvellous enough in its own right without people deriding is as a Lord of the Rings copy (which it isn't), or saying that it is too 'airy-fairy'. And, what is with the accusation by a latter viewer that it (book & movie) is a blatant copy of Star Wars?<br />Okay, there are people who don't like Harry Potter. That's acceptable. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But to start making ludicrous claims is just off the planet. Harry Potter is not a copy of Star Wars, and the Quidditch match is not a copy the Episode 1 Pod Race. Try reading the book again, and then having a look at the copyright date in the front of the book. Then check out the production date for Phantom Menace. Then, grow up and get a life! Sheesh....<br />This is a great movie. It is about friendship and courage, and just happens to be set in the fantastic world of wizards and witches. If you really think this movie is brain-dead, try watching half an hour of Teletubbies, or that insipid...'Blues Clues'. (Anyone who freely uses the phrase 'handy dandy' seriously needs psychiatric help, quickly)<br />At least the stars in Harry Potter can act. Daniel Radcliffe is no Macaulay Culkin (thank God), and he leaves other child actors (ie, Haley Joel Osment) in his dust. Okay, now I'm ranting. But 'The Philosopher's Stone' has far more redeeming features than negative ones, and I find it sad that there are people who - as a wonderful Australian critic stated - feel that they are entitled to trash a movie just because they don't personally like it. You may not like something, but that doesn't always mean it's bad.<br />And for anyone who derides it as being 'just ordinary', I really feel sorry for you.at's acceptable.

B000002HPV|4.0|...Anyway lets talk about the album. <BR>I think Homogenic is Björks best album so far, well Vespertine is allso wery good but its more calm. Homogenic is aggresive but not calm and i think it suits Björk better to be aggresive. <BR>Debut, and Post were just pop-albums that were mostly made to sell many, many copies if you ask me, but im not saying their bad becouse their really good pop albums.<BR>Homogenic includes 10 songs and well ive decided to rate them with stars just for the fun of it:<br />Hunter           ***<BR>Jóga             ***** (the song is unlike any other)<BR>Unravel          **<BR>Bacholerette     ***<BR>All neon like    **<BR>5 years          ***<BR>Immature         *<BR>Alarm call       *<BR>Pluto            **<BR>All isfull ofLove* (the album version is [bad], not the video.v) <br />By the way the songs i rated with 3 stars are all wery good if you ask me, but Jóga is just overwhelming. Maybe you have to be from icelnad to really love it becouse it somehow really seems to reflect the brutal landscape of iceland that is both scary and wery beautyfull at the same time...Hope somone liked this wery long reviev.<BR>Sjáums seinna.
B00006F83Y|4.0|This is probably the best band to became majorly mainstream in a while, and this CD is awesome. The radio-feel to it is original and gives it more 'soul' to the CD, the songs are varied, encompassing many influences from Popular rock to more Prog-oriented and even Death metal. Homme and Oliveri continue to be the core but Grohl and the guitarist certainly add a lot to this album. <br />1. You say I ain't worth a dollar, but I feel like a Millionaire- 9/10. Nice opener, very simple but effective riff and Black-Metal vocals<BR>2. No One Knows- 10/10 The big hit, continues to be great after repeated listens, spooky, eerie, and a somewhat \\"cartoony\\" feel<BR>3. First it Giveth- 10/10 Awesome song with an awesome chorus and a somewhat latin-flavored feel.<BR>4. Song for the Dead 9/10 As the title suggests, it's another spooky song, but indeed very good<BR>5. Sky is Fallin' 8.5/10 Slow-paced song, there is something funny about the chords used, but the song sounds great.<BR>6. Six Shooter 5/10 A grindcore reminiscing song, most likely just a joke song.<BR>7. Hanging Tree 9/10 The tempo of this song gives it a strange feel to it, and it's overall just a great song<BR>8. Go With the Flow 10/10 another of the best songs, there is a very rythmic keyboard in it, and it' certainly a more poppy song.<BR>9. Gonne Leave You 7.5/10 one of the weaker tracks, also poppy but not nearly as catchy as Go with the Flow.<BR>10. Do it Again 8/10 like Gonna Leave You but a bit better.<BR>11. God is on the Radio 9.5/10 Really good song, the lyrics and music are excellent<BR>12. Another Love Song 8.5/10 It's great Musically, similar to Go With the Flow<BR>13. Songs for the Deaf 9/10 Spooky song, but good overall, provides an adequate ending<BR>14. Mosquito Song- 9/10 Extremely odd song played with a 12-String guitar, it's actually pretty good, though very strange, but I guess that what this album is about in part... and that's a good thing.
B000088E6D|5.0|Wow - what a voice with a style that makes you excited to hear each track on the CD.  The orchestrations are way above the average CD.  His sound is as good as any singer, today or in the past, that pounded the 40's style.<BR>Buy the CD.
6303314015|5.0|Great movie!  Sad in one spot I guess, but teaches kids things about life/death too.  Very entertaining!  The songs will have you tapping your feet and the baboon will keep you giggling!  If you don't own this movie - \\"What are you waiting for!?\\"<br /><br />1smileycat :-)
6305508550|4.0|If you too suffer from the fate of inhabiting a cube farm, I think you'll enjoy this film.<br />There is a range of characters that most office workers should be able to relate to, and a wacky set of circumstances that each pursue in their quest for some sort of freedom from the mundane...<br />Funny!
B00005JKDR|4.0|Great Movie! Only gave it 4 stars because I had to explain to my girls ages 4 & 3 a few times that there are no such things as monsters! They weren't scared of them, since the movie teaches them that the monsters are really cute, cuddly, funny, furry things!- but they wanted to know if we had some in our closets!It's a story about Monsters who come out of closets to get you to scream-because screams are what their world is powered by.  The monsters think that KIDS are scarry! One kid gets into the monster side of the world and that's where this story takes off. They have to get her back to her world - but in the mean time they fall in love with this kid.<br />Worth your time & money! Disney did it again!!<br /><br />1smileycat :-)
0060536985|4.0|This novel is really nice to read,and give u a feeling of watching a full featured English movie.Novel goes in a nice manner from the first to last but at the climax.Climax scenes are <BR>somewhat crazy to read.In overall,this is a good novel to buy and expand ur Michael's Fiction novel collection.
B00005JL95|5.0|Disney is the best when it comes to movies!  If you are questioning owning this one - question it no more!  Go buy it!  The Elvis music energizes this story and the giggles are everywhere!<br /><br />This is the story of \\"ohana\\", (family).  Stitch, a martian, monster who is programmed to destroy, well, Everything, ends up on Earth and in an animal shelter. Lilo adopts her new \\"puppy\\", Stitch, and the antics begin! Lilo attempts to teach Stitch some manners with the help of Elvis' music.<br /><br />Lilo and Nani are sisters who have lost their parents. They love each other, but are having a difficult time making ends meet - both financially and as sisters. Stitch helps them both learn about love, as he tries to evade the intergalactic police who have come to take him back to his home planet.<br /><br />There is a lot of music, a lot of laughs, and a lot of love in this movie! I must add - it starts off a little bit slow, but only a little bit.  You'll quickly add it to your favorites list!<br /><br />1smileycat :-)
B00006RU5B|5.0|I love this cd.  It's some of the best straight up, kick [in] rocking music I've heard in a long time.  These guys are kind of like ACDC for the new millenium.  This beats the [golly] out of these so called rock bands like Nickelback.  Hopefully people who've never had the privilege of listening to zeppelin and other true rock bands will hear this and finally see what it's all about.
0788812408|5.0|I was a teenager when this came out...and it was the first movie I ever bought!!  I still enjoy it today!  A classic!  You will not be disappointed in this one!  The girl gets the guy, the crabby crab is funny, funny, funny and the story will keep you watching to the end! If you don't own this one - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!?<br /><br />1smileycat :-)
B000003TB6|5.0|This is the roots greatest project. If you do not own a copy of it you need to go out and get it. When this title was realesed the roots were trying to introduce something new at the time and they were taking a huge chance. Tracks like proceed and distortion to static really show off Black thought and Malik b's lyrical talent. definetly a must own for hip hop lovers.
B0000039PW|5.0|This is the greatest, classiest, and most hype Biggie album ever.  Although this album was released in 1994 his songs still sound like they were just recorded in the studio yesterday.  This album contains such Biggie classics as his first hit, &quot;Juicy,&quot; &quot;Unbelievable&quot;,&quot; Big Poppa,&quot; and &quot;One More Chance.&quot;  This album will always be in high ranks in hip hop and is an excellent buy.  Enjoy all the Biggie music you can because he truly did revolutionize hip hop.
B00003CXDG|4.0|Many fans of the television series found the first Mission: Impossible film to be a disappointing adaptation to the big screen.  The addition of legendary Honk Kong action film guru John Woo--still seeking a true breakthrough US hit--promised a better sequel than the original.<br />The plot: a superbug whose science is a bit unplausible infects red blood cells and spreads a devastating disease.  Suave bad-guy Sean Ambrose steals the virus with the intent of infecting the world's population and selling the antidote to the pharmaceutical company that developed the virus.  The IMF team--headed by Cruise's Ethan Hunt and assisted by a beautiful jewel thief--must recover the antidote and stop Ambrose before he can carry out the deed.<br />The action sequences don't disappoint and are definitely the product of Woo's involvement, including trademark slow-motion sequences framed by flames, smoke, etc.; doves flying through all-out warfare; impressive motorcycle stunts; and the obligatory shot of good guy vs. bad guy with guns pointed at each others' heads.  Where some may find the plot somewhat lacking and perhaps constructed to service said action sequences, the film is somewhat weaker than might have been hoped, but overall it doesn't disappoint like the first movie.  My chief complaint is the lack of involvement by the remaining IMF team members; the film seems almost totally devoted to showing Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton's good looks rather than performing the team-effort so intrisnic to episodes of the original television series.
B00003CXXM|4.0|I loved this movie!  I really did!  Granted, I love Robert Ludlum's creations, but I read The Bourne Identity so long ago I truthfully don't remember much of the book's details.  And you know what, I don't care.<br />I was thoroughly swept away.  The story was inticing, the cinematography wonderful, and the action just thrilling.  And whoever took it upon themselves to tutor Matt Damon in the kissing scenes deserves a raise.  I had an ear-to-ear grin on, because I found I was expecting a certain kind of kiss, couldn't believe it when it unfolded just the way I wanted. <br />If the fighting closeups had been sped up just a tad less, and the corpse-as-an-air-flotation-survival-device been ELIMINATED, I would have given it 5 stars.  I simply found the movie vivid and refreshing.<br />Go ahead and rent it.  You don't even need a date to enjoy it.
6300216047|4.0|Jane Fonda may regret opting Barbarella as one of her earlier films, but fans of bad camp and cult sci-fi are happy to see the actress in this horridly funny sixties film.<br />Fonda plays the title role of a spaice vixen / astronaut in the exceptionally distant yet sixties-fied future.  When genius but mad scientist Dr. Duran Duran (presumably from whom the band took their name) disappears, Barbarella is sent to track him down and given weapons she has no clue how to use (war has been outlawed for ages) and little warning of the planet she'll be landing on.<br />Pursued by evil children with cannibalistic dolls and rescued by a tough man in furs, Barbarella finds out about real sex (thankfully not pictured) when she offers to use a mood-linking pill, the 41st century method of copulation.  From there she's off to a city of evil, avarice, and sin, to be caught by the demented Dr. Duran and put through such tortures as a cage of pecking budgies to the doctor's notorious and sensual machine for execution by sheer pleasure to a lake of liquid evil whose effects look to have been done by lava lamp.  Along the way she meets various helpers (most of whom she ends up sleeping with), including a blind angel named Pygar.<br />Barbarella's costumes vary with each scene, all skin-tight and definitely satirizing the garb of women of golden-age science fiction.  On the whole, the movie pokes fun at the field of early science fiction rather well with a heaping helping of sixties hippie culture thrown in for good measure.<br />Barbarella is by no means a good movie, but it is excellent fare for fans of campy sci-fi that would be right at home on MST:3K and quite humorous when taken with a grain of salt.
B00008972S|5.0|What is so extraordinary about this new DVD of WEST SIDE STORY is that for the very first time, we get to hear some of Natalie Wood's own vocal tracks, long considered missing.  The producer's gave Natalie a chance to do some of her own singing (with Marni Nixon stepping in originally only to help out on the high soprano parts) and Natalie did a fine job, considering she was not known really as a vocalist.  However, after Natalie's scenes were all finishedthey called Marni Nixon in again and requested that she dub in ALL the singing.  This was much to Natalie'schagrin, as she tried and worked very hard with a vocal coach to do a good job.  Now, after forty (!)  years, weall can have a chance to at least hear what her own vocals were like.  The following film for Natalie was GYPSYand fans may be interested to know that in her role as GYPSY ROSE LEE Natalie did indeed do all her own vocals.WEST SIDE STORY on DVD is always a musical treat and this AnniversaryDeluxe Package is a Collector's delight.
B00005JKDQ|4.0|Disney and Pixar have again teamed up to create an outstanding computer-animated film.  I must admit that the trailers and hype had me skeptical, but when I saw the film in theaters, I changed my mind--this is a great film, particularly for kids (though adults can enjoy it, too!)<br />The premise: the monsters under your bed, in your closet, etc. are REAL, and their world connects to ours through the closet doors.  Those monsters don't really want to eat young, terrified kids; it's just the fear they're after as an eco-friendly power source.<br />That's where our main charcters come in, as the best scarer, Sulley, and his set-up man, Mike (the two voiced to great effect by John Goodman and Billy Crystal) find one young girl unafraid of the cute and furry Sulley who follows him back to the the monster's land though her closet door.  The neat plot device is that monsters are in fact terrified of kids, believing contact with them deadly.  Thus the first half or so of the film is devoted to Mike and Sulley's antics of trying desperately to hide and return the kid to her home, dressing her up in a monster costume and lugging her all about town as they try to locate the door leading back to her bedroom all the while avoiding the men-in-black-esque &quot;decontamination&quot; teams. Adults and children alike will enjoy the their antics and the saccharinely sweet kid's charm.<br />The second half of the film does flag off a bit from the first as Sulley and Mike discover a nefarious plot to kidnap and harness the fear of children through a mechanical monstrosity reminiscent of the infamous tentacle monsters of anime.  The chase scenes that ensue are at times repetitive and predictable and lack much of the charm of the first half of the movie (though not the slapstick schitck), but not a child will notice as they cheer on Sulley and Mike.<br />Overall, this is one of the more original and cuter films to come out of Disney in a long time.
B000089RVX|2.0|The truely sad thing here is that Amy Lee's beautiful voice is wasted on this trite collection of music overlays.  The music which accompanies her angelic voice is boring and cliche - it sounds like throw-away material from linkin park.  The best we can hope for is that Amy Lee goes solo or else finds someone who can make a musical score on par with her breathtaking voice.  2 Stars - best not to waste your money...

1573229725|4.0|This is a dark Victorian drama that revolves around the lives of two young women, Sue and Maud.  These characters have their lives determined by circumstances out of their control, they are affected by greed and corruption from a very early age.<br />It is a harrowing story to read, rich in suspense and hosts a cast of characters unlike any other book.  Nothing in this story is at it seems.  There are buried secrets, double crossing, greed, betrayal and amongst the ruins, there is love.<br />This was an excellent read. I look forward to reading more by this wonderful author.
B0000648WZ|5.0|I don't have the ambition to address every point raised by this great film, but I do NEED to address something that I have never read from anyone and must be said: The characters being portrayed as simpletons and \\"cliche\\" is a marvelously witty satire of WW II era films--both feature length and propaganda clips.  I LOVE their stereotypical dialogue and simple characterizations!  It's hysterical!  I cringe every time somebody wirtes that the characters were too simplistic or even too naive to be real.  Of course they were!  That's the beauty and strength of those characters.
B00005LMBK|4.0|Since I wasn't really too hot on purchasing this CD because I figured it would get really old, I borrowed it from a friend. Man, was I wrong. Some stand out tracks are definitely \\"Slow Country\\", a great song with a whirring opening, \\"M1 A1\\", with it's Twilight Zone-esque opening and it's heavier body and \\"Dracula\\", a great song that opens with an eerie medieval tune, and doesn't stop. The two singles that I've heard in the US \\"Clint Eastwood\\" and \\"19-2000\\" are also great, poppy and infectious.<br />The CD did not earn it's Parental Advisory. They swear no more than a few times, albeit the \\"F\\" bomb almost every time. You'd hardly notice if it was edited, anyways.
B00003CXXM|3.0|I really would give this movie 3.5 stars. Its direction is inspired, its pace is quick and fun, and Matt Damon does an awesome job. <br />However, having read the book long ago, I just can't get over what the writers did to the character of Marie. In the book, she is a brilliant, savvy financial banker, whose assistance is vital to Bourne discovering the truth about his origins. After she decides to trust him (because of her own keen observations and despite the fact that he does not trust himself), she would never leave him to his own devices. In the movie, she is basically... Well, not the most intelligent of women, a \\"free spirit\\" who is far less loyal than he.<br />The movie's changes also include a liberal slant in the plotline (i.e. government is corrupt and its goals evil) foreign to the original Bourne, wherein the CIA acted in good faith based on the best information they had, and Bourne was a truly good man who because of weird circumstances believed he was truly evil. In this version, Bourne never even discovers his real name, let alone his true self. He's just \\"on [his] own side now.\\" And the truth behind his killer instincts is left unclear.<br />However, had I not read the book, these would be very small drawbacks. Indeed, they didn't keep me from enjoying the movie immensely. Its foreign locales, clever plot, and nonstop action make for a truly entertaining experience. <br />Oh, as for the extras on the DVD, they don't add much. The Moby video is interspersed with so many clips from the movie it's like watching the flick all over again, and the documentary doesn't reveal anything fascinating. (One question: Why did the director care that \\"Run Lola Run\\" star Franka Potente could handle the action side of things? All her character does the majority of the movie is hang on for the ride, scream at appropriate moments, panic, and wring her hands. Oh, and vomit and sleep with a [admittedly gorgeous] stranger. No real physical strain involved there.)
B00000720W|5.0|NORWAY,S MOST VIOLENT DEATHPUNK BAND EVER. my brother who is a very big fan got me in too this music.
B00006FDCD|5.0|IT can be anything. A fanged monster that won't stay on the movie screen. Something ominous lurking in the basement. No matter what your biggest fear is, no one knows IT better than Stephen King.
B000002TYK|5.0|Whenever you listen to this cd, it just makes you play air drums like a maniac.. definately a good time.. the chix dig it.
B000088E6D|5.0|A pure combination of Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra with a mix of Nat King Cole.  Very enjoyable to listen too.  Smooth as silk voice, excellant passion, well worth the purchase.
B000056K04|2.0|I am an avid fan of DMB (love Crash, Under the Table &amp; Dreaming, and Before These Crowded Streets).  However, this CD is so gloomy that it's hard to listen to.  There are hardly any upbeat songs, and many of the slower songs sound alike.  I heard that Dave Matthews was going through a depression when the band recorded this, and it obviously shows.  Stick with the above mentioned if you are new to DMB.  I strongly advise you not to purchase this mundane CD.
B00003OSTQ|5.0|A powerful and entertaining satire on television! Wonderfully written by Paddy Chayefsky. Great performances by Peter Finch, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, and Ned Beatty(in a small but powerful scene). A surprising ending!
B000069AUI|3.0|As you probably have read some place else, coldplay can be compared to other bands like radiohead or even U2. No doubt those comparisons are valid. Still, a very good band with a cd that contains music powerfull enough to stand by itself (although not to stand out from others) but good enough. If you are one of this guys who thought Nirvana was the original thing but still enyoes Soundgarden, STP etc, this is the band for you. Not the best or the original thing but without a doubt good enough to make it worth having in your collection.
B00007AJGH|4.0|I am a big fan or Roger Rabbit. It's silly. It's fun. Bob Hoskins is entertaining. I was surprised to watch it again and discover just how well the combination of the animation and the live action photography has held up. It's not completely seamless, but it's not really meant to be. It looks good -- vibrarant -- and it's really neat to watch cartoons manipulate live action props. I had always wondered how that was accomplished.<br />That's what the DVD is for. It will answer that question and any others you may have. It also shows you extensive footage of the live action characters reacting to nothing, reacting to stand-in puppets, and reacting to electronic devices that do some of the animators' work for them. The supplemental material is interesting and well organized. The first disc is essentially for kids and passing fans. It has a full screen version so that little kids won't cry upon seeing black lines.<br />The second disc is for more interested adult spectators. It has the widescreen version and the commentary. <br />I would recommend the DVD for its extras as much as for its actual film content. There is even a fun set-up where you must search for some of the special features. Silly as this sounds, it ended up being kind of fun, partly because they had the good sense to make it an actual search, fraught with disappointing leads that bring you nowhere. And, by the way, open the vault -- it's weird. You'll know what I mean when you get the DVD.
0440180295|4.0|\\"Slughterhouse-Five\\" was a little strange for my taste, however the message suits for real life in any time period.  Even if you don't read it as anti-war propaganda (I didn't immediately connect with this theme), it applies just as much to peaceful times as times of conflict.  <br />Vonnegut's portrayal of death as a normal occurance is more striking to me than the anti-war theme, because he NEVER let's you forget about it.  \\"So it goes\\" litters every page, and makes you see the death in ordinary situations that you probably wouldn't have thought about.  Every time I saw \\"So it goes,\\" I felt something drop in my stomach.  Just what you want when you read...something that makes you feel.<br />He also shows a creative way to synthesize the difference between time and space, a way to find some meaning in life, and a few subtle (sometimes not-so-subtle) jabs at what he believes is wrong with the American way of life.  His method of doing it all was strange and sometimes confusing (why only 4 stars), but picking through the confusion you can come up with anew idea that Vonnegut hid in the rubble!<br />Forgetting all of that, it was a funny book in its irrelevancy and randomness, and sad in the same exact manner.  Maybe that's why it strikes a chord.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is a literary masterpiece written by Anthony Burgess. The story shows a grim and dark \\"future\\", where free will is not something that is commonly seen as it is today. Alex, the main character in the story, is not the usual \\"hero\\". He is a cruel and evil man who rapes and kills people, which makes him seem more like a villain. But things happen which cause Alex to change. By the end he seems to have become his complete opposite. He no longer wants to kill, but to start over and even start a family.<br />The NADSAT is a very interesting tool that was used in the creation of this book. It is the futuristic form of slang that is used throughout the book. Like so many people say, it is difficult at first, but it does get much simpler as you progress through the book. The NADSAT adds a lot of flavor and makes things seem more \\"realistic\\". For those who just can't seem to understand the NADSAT there are glossaries in some of the books, and glossaries can also be found online. All you have to do is search using a search engine such as Yahoo or Google.<br />I recommend this to every reader whether young or old. It will work your mind in many ways and make you think of things that you never thought of before.
B00006JMXH|5.0|Some of the best stuff spanning Nirvana's entire carrer a must have for any fan and a good introduction for any newcomers.  Features both powerful, heavy rock and acustic songs.  Greatest hits from the greatest band ever plus two bonus tracks you won't usually find in stores.
B000002NAK|5.0|There is no way we can compare Madonna to previous performers.  The key here is to enjoy, sit and watch a talented performer singing her heart out in the role of Evita... It's not who, it's the story, and the story is so beautifully told...  At 62, my  opinion of Madonna was....er, nil?  But, after seeing this movie, the woman has true ability...along with Jonathan Pryce and Antonio Banderas. A movie worth watching..  If I could give it 6 stars, I would.
0385504209|5.0|While Da Vinci Code features Robert Langdon, last seen destroying the Vatican Library in Brown's Angels and Demons, reading the earlier title isn't a prerequisite to enjoying this one; Da Vinci Code stands alone.  Like Browns' earlier title, this one is a page-turner that is hard to put down, full of twists and turns at a breakneck pace as the search for the Grail becomes a simultaneous flight from attack.  It is also a title that can be re-read, packed with interesting trivia that bears re-examination; while it is a &quot;fun read&quot;, full of fast-paced action, there are elements of the novel that themselves might serve as the subject of scholarly analysis; this title defines &quot;intellectual thriller&quot;.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is absolutely incredible. The music mixes beautifully orchestrated strings with a hard rock influence. The lyrics are extremely moving and sung with such a lovely voice by Amy Lee. This is a must for anyone looking for something new, exciting and fantastic. If you end up loving this CD, also look into a CD called 5:30 Saturday Morning by a girl called Lennon. It's the same type of music with hauntingly beautiful lyrics sung by a rich voice. Happy listening!
B00005JKZT|5.0|NOTE-THIS MOVIE WAS SNUBBED IN OSCAR NOMINATIONS(hehe)<BR>In December of 2001 I thought that no movie could be as grand and fantastic as The Fellowship Of The Ring.  I didn't think that The Two Towers would be close to as good...eveyone makes mistakes.  From the minute the lights dim to the battle of Helm's Deep no single person can take their eyes off of The Two Towers. <br />      The story continues with Frodo and Sam making their way to Mordor with a sneaky figure following not far behind.  What an amaing looking \\"figure\\" it is...Gollum is the only CG character that looks, sounds, and feels like a real creature that could exist.  Gollum has a soul...unlike many CG you see today.  To continue, the three warriors (Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas) of the broken Fellowship are tracking Uruk-Hai to the land of Rohan in search of Merry and Pippin.  Another amazing group of characters of the Ents of Fangorn Forest, they are walking & talking trees.  Sounds dumb but its really pretty cool.  The acting in this movie is so heart felt and intense you just can't say enough of every character.  The seem to pour their heart and their soul in evey line and movement.  Viggo Mortensen is amazing in this film...why he didn't get an Oscar Nomination? I will never know.  TTT makes up for the first films lack of fighting with the best battle sequences ever seen.  Amazing weapons, armor, costumes, and props add huge amounts of realism to the films amazing emotional drive.  I won't tell you too much information because it might spoil a great story.  With the Return of the King promising to be \\"by far the best of the saga\\"(Director Peter Jacksons quote)I can hardly wait!!  RUN TO THE CINEMA TO WATCH THIS!!!
044651652X|3.0|Okay, so maybe this Romance Novel slips over the edge of mushy sentimentalism. I read this years ago when it came out and promptly dismissed the writer. DON'T DO THIS. You will miss reading the thought-provoking insights and well-crafted writing of an author who possesses the story-telling skills and lyricism of Wallace Stegner. I urge you to read One Good Road is Enough (essays). One essay in this book is the best summary I've read on how to write well. Some of the later fiction is better than &quot;Bridges&quot;. This is a gifted writer.
0446677450|5.0|This book absolutely changed my paradigm of money and life in general.  I am a full time student in college.  Before I picked up this book, I was struggling to figure out what I want to do in life.  After reading &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot;, I found what I was missing all along.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get ahead in life.  This book teaches the basic fundamentals that every person needs to know to succeed.
B000066AXC|5.0|Outstanding acting, depicting the life of John Nash, Russell Crowe is excellent!  Heartbreaking story and yet one which shows the brilliant nature of people when they are in situations that would seem almost impossible to deal with, until they are forced to that is!<br />This film really is a must-see, lots of twists and turns, plenty of laughs and many tears, both on and off the screen.<br />I recommend this film, without a doubt, truly amazing!
B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking Life is IMPORTANT.  See this film at least once just to be introduced to some concepts that you may not have ever considered before.  I had never seen a film so infused with intelligent commentary on the human condition.  Granted at times it is more facetious than insightful.  The humor is there to express the hilarious nature of the human thought process.  Do not listen to someone if they say that this film is only meant for mensa cardholders.  It may take more than one viewing to absorb ALL of the implications made by this film, but ANYONE can learn something from Waking Life.  Like many visually appealing films this one was best seen in the theaters.  The DVD has some really cool features like &quot;snack and a soda&quot;.  This short features Mr.Power (he has an interesting part in Waking Life) going out to get refreshments at a local convenience store.  The twist is that this was Mr.Sabiston's chance to go wild with the rotoscoping animation program.  Also included is a thorough explanation of that very animation process.  If you are a commentary addict like myself you will be pleased by both Richard Linklater's and the other featuring many actors from the film.  In conclusion, check your alarm clock when you wake up just to make sure you aren't really just dreaming it.  You might be surprised at how often the numbers are incomprehensible.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay, along with some other new acts, are frontlining the movement to return music to what it was always supposed to be, art, not noise. In fact, they are creating a totally new sound, one that cannot be completely slotted into any existing genre. This was clear even when their sublime debut, Parachutes, came out some time ago. This equally masterful second record re-affirms the fact. It is, in three words, Brilliant, brilliant, and brilliant. Politik will get you hooked, and when you've finished off with Amsterdam, you will be compelled to hear the album again, and again, and again.....<BR>Every song on the album is outstanding, which is something you really don't see nowadays. In My Place is typical Coldplay, being expressly lyrical and emotional, while being euphonious as well. Clocks is magical, for want of a higher superlative. The piano is used very, very well here. That is the standout on this track. 'The Scientist' is unreal. The first time I heard it, I found myself wondering whether such a song could exist at all! Breathtaking. Daylight is reminiscent of late '60s Sergeant-Pepperesque psychedelia. Amsterdam's beautiful piano had me hooked. I found myself amazed at the band's raw musicianship after hearing each track for the first time. This album is an absolute must for any lover of music. It is truly, in every sense of the word, compelling.<BR>Also, Coldplay's backing of the Fair Trade movement shows us their concern about a very real and omnipresent problem, and also tells us that not all people are indifferent towards the economic exploitation of 'third-world' countries.
B000002UWE|5.0|lush and lovely songs unmatched by any other band. Talk Talk managed to cover a lot of territory on their albums - from electro pop to expansive jazz fusions. They were successful artistically at every turn.<br />Musical visionaries - no doubt.
B00005JM93|4.0|The filming, although made most people nauscious, was pretty well done.  The violence was well done, and acting very natural. I can't say I would add this to my collection, because I don't think I would want to watch the rape scene again.  Mr Noe, did a great job by making a disgusting film and I know that he intended it to be like that. So congrats.   The rape scene had to be that long, since they were trying to be natural. I liked, the sweethereafter of the film, towards the end, when the main characters are interacting and they don't know what's coming. But we do. That's the saddest.
B00000IGGA|5.0|These are songs full of such depth and feeling. Tom Waits is an extraordinary talent who takes snapshots of life at times disturbing and at times beautiful, but always moving. One grows to understand amusing facets of life and new twists on old emotions. Just when the listener is taken to the edges of despair and sorrow, she is lifted to heights beyond expectations.<br />I hear sounds that I didn't know existed when I listen to Waits.<br />Perhaps that is what I love best in the wonderful music of Waits. The music mirrors life with all its ups and downs. Somehow within it all one sees or feels the richness and variety and discovers profundity in it.<br />Waits is a highly enjoyable talent constantly breaking boundaries, ultimately to the listener's delight. Buying this album is no waste.
B00007G207|5.0|Then this is the ultimate film for you.  It is an enchanting timeless tale of one's coming of age and reflections of the past.  In the center of it all is love.<br />The story is a simple one, a middle aged-man reflecting on the small Italian village he left behind years ago. The &quot;love&quot; aspect the film has is a combination of two things:  the love the main character lost years ago and his even greater love (it seems) for movies and the special relationship he forged with the village's movie reel operator.<br />I can hardly describe in words the journey this film will take you on but be rest assured, it is one you will soon not forget.
0802130208|5.0|Ignatius J. Reilly is one of the best characters in a book, ever!  The absurdities he deals with are a riot and kept me laughing throughout.  Strange people, stranger jobs... the way he deals with it all brings to mind two other book characters, Eddie Delano in John Orozco's `Delano' and Lenny Castellaneta's factitious self portrait in `No One's Even Bleeding'.  All of these men try to make sense of bizarre situations they encounter in their lives.  It's amazing, though, how well `Dunces' holds up over the years.  Second time I've read it, second time I've loved it!
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's new offering, The Da Vinci Code, is an intellectually stimulating and pulse-quickening triumph.  The combination of completley unanticipated plot twists, fascinating artistic and historical facts, and the stunning manner in which Mr. Brown interweaves and interprets them is a tour de force.  It is truly a rare offering that is both accessible, educational, and addictive.<br />As in his past books, Mr. Brown offers multidimensional characters, with a special mention for his complex, not-cookie-cutter female protagonists.  His depth of research into art, science, religion, secret codes, and architecture will make you want to have your web browser nearby.  As he carries you deeper into an area where art and religion mix with Church philosophy, the Knights Templar, and centuries-old conspiracies, Mr. Brown manages to explain clearly complex histories while racing you onward.  While you will not want to stop reading this book (for ANY reasons, like eating or sleeping), every now and then you may wish to pause to let your mind catch up with your racing heart.<br />This is a book that should appeal to anyone looking for a rare item: a thrilling page-turner that is both accessible to anyone but that does not insult anyone's intelligence.  It will pump you full of adrenaline and knowledge.  The Da Vinci Code will be the book that everyone is talking about for great reasons.
0316666343|5.0|I loved this book so much that I read it almost entirely in one sitting.  I think the author did a great job of showing us how Susie saw her family after her death and I loved the way she got to experience some of the childhood she lost by watching her older sister grow up.  She was also very authentic in telling the story through the eyes of a child.  I think some people may have found it too depressing, but it's about a little girl who was murdered, so it's not entirely unexpected that it may be a bit depressing.  In the end, though, I found that while the book evoked a sense of loss, it also left me with a sense of optimism.  I found it to be a very moving and beautifully written story.
B0000027F8|4.0|In my mind, the best track off &quot;Listen Without Prejudice&quot; is &quot;Mothers Pride,&quot; an elegantly arranged ballad in which George Michael articulates the pain of a mother who loses her child to fight in combat.  Authentic to the core, this piano-flavored song ranks among Michael's best, and to this day it makes me get a little emotional whenever I hear it.  Elsewhere on the album, we find George trying to sever ties from his teenybopper past in Wham!, and for the most part he succeeds.  &quot;Soul Free&quot; is a rump-shaking number that flies on the strength of its Soul II Soul-esque groove, while &quot;Waiting For the Day&quot; and the deliciously jazzy &quot;Cowboys and Angels&quot; shows that George is a long way from the perkiness of &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.&quot;  &quot;Listen Without Prejudice&quot; sold only a mere fraction of what its predecessor &quot;Faith&quot; did, and it began a very public battle with his now former label Sony.  Yet, it's a compelling disc that still holds up well.  Listen not only without prejudice but with wide open ears
B0000019PA|5.0|For whatever reason, Neutral Milk Hotel's music hits me like a wave of nostalgic, pre-modern, hyper-romantic, love dreams. <br />Listening to NMH feels to me like someone has tapped a secret part of my brain, and channeled all the activity there onto a round piece of vinyl (my preferred medium for NMH).<br />The songs are dreamy, stream-of-consiousness style in both lyrics and music.  The music is simple, yet lush and original..  there is no mistaking the sound of NMH -- fuzz bass, bassy, thick, acoustic guitar, eclectic instrumentation, and fully-exposed emotion in the voice of Jeff Magnum.  <br />I think this album is a concept album, but I haven't thought about the theme too much.. maybe something about going back in time before or during ww2 to find someone that you may have loved?  traces of ann frank?  i've no idea, but it doesn't matter.. the music hits hard right in the heart..<br />not a record for cynics..
B0000048CP|5.0|I heard it first time when I was 15 and I still can't forget this intro and mysterious atmosphere of whole album(now I'm 27). \\"Blood, Fire, Death\\" shows Bathory in it's best form - between primitive first albums and viking metal presented on Hammerheart. It's still fast, primitive black metal, but riffs are better, scream is more clear and lyrics, together with intro saturate this album with strange pagan atmosphere. You can almost see Viking boats coming into sight from a mourning haze.
B00000HZFH|4.0|To call Martsch a &quot;guitar god&quot; is a bit excessive and seems to run counter to what BTS stands for. Sure this album has guitar solos, but they are interwoven into the song as they sit harmoniously on top of chords or behind vocals. There is a certain humility that is prevelant throughout BTS's music that is evidenced in this album. Guitar solos are nice but they aren't the focal point of the songs which are orchestrated quite well. Even the solo on Carry the Zero is reserved and languid as it bridges a lyrical theme that we are quite involved in. <BR>All of BTS albums are like this, as well. They forfeit grandiosity for a complete aesthetic. The song in its totality is more important than solos, which makes their albums ironically grander when taken as a whole. This was evident in Perfect from Now On, but less so on Keep It As A Secret. Borrowing from Sonic Youth's rhythms the album is a fluid movement driven by chords and simple guitar work layered on top. This broad movement of guitars creats a great atmosphere and a absolutely fun listening experience. <BR>Don't listen to me, but the album!
0385486804|3.0|I didn't find this book particularly interesting.  It was hard to follow at times, because it skipped back and forth between stories.  It's about a man, Chris McCandless, who left home after college to make a new life for himself.  He gave up his $25,000 in his savings to charity and dumped most of his possessions.  He travels throughout the country meeting new people, hoping to get to Alaska.  Finally, he gets to Alaska, but dies soon after.  I would recommend that you don't read this book.
B000003TAL|5.0|Besides bands like the Pixies and the Replacements it is hard to think of a band from the 80's that was more influential on the &quot;alternative&quot; scene that supposedly materialized in the early 90's. The alt. scene was alive and robust in the 80's and this album is pure evidence. Daydream Nation is one of the top 5 albums of the last twenty years. It is a near perfect composition as it presents fresh new music that is both punkish but complex and smart. <BR>From the anthemish Teenage Riot to Gordon's pleading lyrics on epic songs like the sprawl this album offers in depth, well developed songs that zoom along at light speed. There is a wall of sound that SY is known for and it isn't used better than in this album. Layered guitars, rifling drum rolls and signature Gordon base lay the precedent that is Sonic Youth. <BR>Prior to Sonic Youth it is hard to find a sound that is even close. Sure bands experienced with distortion, but it was grandiose and the exception, and while SY uses distortion to mock themselves in songs like Silver Rocket, they incorporate it so well and it is enveloped by the music rather than dwarfing it.<BR>There is so much going on in this album that you have to listen over and over to approach comprehension. This is their best album and one of the most important ever made. They had moments of genius after Daydream Nation, but none so concentrated and brilliant....Genius!
B00007G1ZC|5.0|This is, quite simply, the most visually stunning film I have seen since \\"Days of Heaven.\\" It surpasses even that earlier film in its intensity of visual content and technical mastery. Criticisms aimed at its literary content may be valid to a certain degree, but this is a film to buy just to LOOK at. Turn off the sound and the subtitles if you don't like them. This film doesn't need them. It is a complete joy to watch.<br />I'm adding this caveat post-posting because I read a new customer review that criticizes the apparent fact that the DVD does not respect the original screen aspect of the film. This will be a terrible blow to fans of this beautiful film. I haven't received my copy of the DVD yet, but I'm considering returning it if this is the case. You just don't do that to fine works of art.
B00002R0MC|5.0|This is a nice compilation of songs, but I recommend the real albums for there are no bad songs by Bob Marley. What is nice about this, though, is some of the early stuff that I hadn't heard before. Five stars because it is Bob, but not a necessity if you have the individual albums...
