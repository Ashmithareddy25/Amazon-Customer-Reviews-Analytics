B001NLL93W|5.0|I was recommended these by my daughter.  We have read many series together.  This one is very well written and keeps my interest.  Love the characters in it and can nto wait to see the first movie.
B007EDYN36|4.0|My childhood hero....I started playing drums because of him.  I am very disappointed how gene and Paul treated him, someone who was supposed to be a brother and friend.  Shame on them.  Without Peter and Ace, KISS is not KISS, they are only a peck.  Thanks for the great stories Peter....loved the book!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is not for everyone. It is a bit vulgar, but I am ok with that. The story makes up for it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|wish it was easier to get money. but overall not bad. I like all the mini games and trying to achieve the goals
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Eva and Gideon are irresistable! I can't believe I have to wait until May to see what happens next!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I'm not a vegetarian or ultra runner, but I appreciate quality food (both for it's nutrition, as well as, environmental impact) and love trail running, so that probably gave me bias to really get into this tale of extremes. Like many, I read &#34;Born to Run&#34; and loved it. My nephew turned me on to &#34;Once a Runner&#34; and after finishing this and it's follow up &#34;Again to Carthage&#34;, I thought I had pretty much had my fill of awesome running stories.<br /><br />Nope, one more. Nephew said be careful as I might just become an ultra runner. No way! These guys are more than just fit athletes. Rather amazing what they do. Totally extreme. It was a great read; finding out how one of the best ever, the Jerker got started and conquered so much. He is very open about his strengths and weaknesses, ups and downs, and never pushy about his vegan ways. Going to be trying a lot of his recipes as well. Highly recommend this book to anybody like me that is into health, running, and maybe a bit of the extremes.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|I loved it , it's been one of my favorite movies for years , I've watched it on my old 8 track untill I got thet blue ray , what a difference .
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My daughter really enjoys this movie. We like the bluray for the high def and the extras but it's not necessary if you don't want to the extra expense.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Dang it.  I hate when that happens.  I was about to throw something at the screen.  I really like Jeremy Renner and he does a different Bourne lead.  This guy has a sense of humor and that threw me after three stone-faced Jason Bourne flicks.  It felt like somebody nervously stepped on my toes during our first dance.  Forgiveable, but a second dance?  Probably not.<br /><br />Don't pay more than a dollar at Redbox.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Every other device besides the kindle has an updated version of Minecraft PE. If you have a kindle and are thinking of getting this game expect to wait a lot longer for the updates while everyone tells you how awesome it is.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It is rare that I become so involved in a book that I can actually feel the emotions.
B009X01C64|5.0|I love it. Keeps my Kindle protected, the screen adjusts to different positions, and can charge it while in the cover.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great Multi-tasking option when waiting or watching or visiting.  passes the time while not wasting time. like the Vegas scoring.
B004KBSQOW|4.0|some songs I did not recognize but they were good. His voice is unique, and the music is soothing coool.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Amazing album that got me hooked on Lana del Rey.  &#34;Video Games&#34; is one of the most simple and yet beautiful love songs I have ever heard.  Love the lyrics in &#34;Off to the Races.&#34;  Love song and video for &#34;National Anthem.&#34;  Summertime Sadness great beat and song.  Also love &#34;This is what Makes us Girls&#34; - catchy and so true.  All great tracks.  I will never be tired of them!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Works great for sleeping. High quality app, Some loops may be a little too short for some people but that doesn't bother me.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I am addicted to Lana's voice and what she makes you feel.  My favorites - Ride, which I feel should become a classic song - most artistic video of the year.  I also love American and just how she articulates things about life in America, being modern yet also sometimes nostalgic for the past.  Gods and Monsters, Cola and Body Electric are all great tracks too.  I hope she releases something new soon!!
B0011UJMK2|1.0|Is it possible to give negative stars? This book opens with a description of two children attempting to trap and dismember a starving cat. A GRAPHIC description. I was doing a little late night reading, trying to relax at bed time, and ended up with those images in my head all night long. I've reached a point where I'm tired of writers using this kind of stuff to because torturing animals is somehow acceptable if it is \\"literature.\\" As someone who deals with the real thing every day, I assure you -  unless you're one of the sadists who gets off on it, don't include it in your fiction. It's a cheap shot.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Loved it, the inspiration of never giving up and love and understanding the movie conveys is enjoyable. Not a complete chick movie, guy will like it to.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Glad I got all 3. First book probably the best, though the others are great to keep the story going if you are an avid reader and want to get to the end of the trilogy

B0012HF5NC|5.0|Love this movie. If you like sy fy and Will Smith you will like this movie. Great all the way around.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I look forward to opening this game to see what others drew or if they could guess what I drew.  It is a challenge to come up with a drawing for some words.  The only problem with this game is I currently am random friended with someone who is obviously in a non English country. I couldn't guess his picture properly and the answer was gotye. What is a gotye?! My husband and I thought it is goatee. Then I made a simple picture that my friend could easily guess in English an  he  tried to spell it with letters that didn't make sense to me. So he sees the same problem on his end.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app rocks if you have young girls. My nieces love this app.  Little boys who into horses might like it as well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great. it has really cool graphics and its very interactive. I love it and play it a lot!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I should start by saying that I don't really find white noise helpful to sleep yet.  I have been having some issues with insomnia and a Dr recommended it, so I tried a couple of the free ones. But, when this one went free on Amazon I figured it was serendipity and downloaded it.<br /><br />This is definitely the best I have tried out so far.  Far and away, the best feature is how it interacts with the phone: it can be kept on when set back to the home screen, and used while other apps are running (most of the ones I've dealt with require the app to be physically open on the screen)The sound quality and quality of looping is near perfect (there are only a few I can tell are looped and only if I'm paying pretty close attention).  The options for timers and using it as an alarm are about as good as these get (I'm finding that very few of them are super well organized as alarm clocks), and the ability to get extra sounds online is a pretty cool option.<br /><br />The only one I'v found that is about as good is the &#34;Relax Mobile&#34; app.  This one has a pretty extensive free version, and also has some musical options which is nice, but lacks the ability to jump around to other apps or run when on the home screen.<br /><br />All and all, I'd say if you find white noise helpful, this is well worth the download. Although, bear in mind I got it free so you'll have to figure out how much it's worth.
1742200206|3.0|My grandparents lived in New York and I spent almost every summer and vacation with them. They gave me almost free rein to wander the city as long as I was accompanied by a massive young man who helped them in their small restaurant. Some of my fondest memories are of the places we wandered around and explored. Lonely Planet guides usually follow along the lines of what my taste has been for exploring cities, this one lacks a bit of what some of those others have.<br /><br />This book has some good points but it seems to miss the mark with others, even if you are an infrequent or first time visitor and not someone who is spending more time in the city. There are some decent itineraries with routes marked out and lunch and dinner suggested. Some help is given...with kids, like a local. However so many of New York's iconic delis are left out and since these have such as great New York atmosphere and food and are reasonably priced I found their exclusion strange.<br />Some of the descriptions for stores seem dated and quite frankly again one wonders why some very reasonable nice and popular shops were left out. Directions for out of towners are sometimes vague, for example the Chrysler building, they say there is no observation deck or restaurant, but then what? Can you go in and look at the lobby? 15 pages on day trips outside of the city could have been better spent giving more city information - after all that's what the book is for<br /><br />The organization occasionally leaves much to be desired. The index can be confusing and hard to use.  The maps on the pages in the back are good and their placement is perfect. There is also a larger fold out map. Hotels/sleeping accommodations are listed in the back, when it is usually and to my preference listed in the areas they are located. That way if you are concentrating on central Manhattan you can find suggested accommodations there in an easier fashion. Unlike, even many other Lonely Planet guides the safety and cautions section is a bit sketchy, not a helpful factor.<br />This is an okay guide, but I would try some others in the meanwhile that might be better recommended.ions section is a bit sketchy, not a helpful factor.<br />This is an okay guide, but I would try some others in the meanwhile that might be better recommended.
1449410243|5.0|I purchased this present for my mom for Christmas of 2012, and I told myself that I wasn't going to read it until she looked at it, as I wanted the book to appear as brand new, without a creased spine. I read it twice. Although some of Matthew's work that is freely viewable on The Oatmeal is featured in this book, this book contains some material I have never seen before. It also comes with a nice poster in the back. For ~10 bucks, it's definitely worth a read through.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I found that there was to much  violence for me, I thought that it should had more of  a<br />love connection.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is amazingly fun I love it but I cant control it. anytime I tilt to collect the coins it barley lets me tilt and a lot of times when I duck or jump or turn sometimes it just doesn't let me.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Got it for the kindle fire. I like it. I always found what I was searching for with it. Fun.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I thought this would be better than the original temple run, but I guess not! It lags everytime Iplay it. I've seen better.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Perfect ending to a great adaptation of a classic. The best Batman run ever brought to life. Arguably as good if not better than the Nolan Trilogy.

B004ZRV3AU|2.0|Wouldn't waste your money, it will work, but not the easiest to use. A wet tile saw is the best and easiest option for cutting glass.

B008OTTRXU|4.0|I bought this so I could play and sing along with my grandchildren. Well It's a great hit. They love that I can sing along with them. Carlyle Rae's song Beautiful with Justin Beber is fantastic. Kiss is a very catchy Cd for young girls.

B00A8ECU24|3.0|My daughter LOVES this game! I'd like to add that I enjoy playing this with her.  I'm disappointed in the fact that it's difficult to add people unless you have usernames and you seem to only be able to add up to four people to visit in game: game crashes when you try to visit to gift and collect heart gems (currency needed for specific ponies). Also it costs a lot of REAL CURRENCY to get ponies...I don't mind paying, just not a couple hundred dollars to get all the ponies.  Would love more mini games too!

B004LZEV4Q|5.0|This was great for two separate grandchildren to hear my voice. I have two separate grandchildren who I don't get to talk or see as much as the other ones. Goodnight Moon was a classic I read to their mothers. U can even admin and they will never know or care.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|After reading this book, I feel like a different person, to appreciate life more, and to participate. It is a great slice of like from the most intense period of your early life.
B008G59IBI|2.0|I have reviewed the 2 albums released before this one earlier .for me Uno was by far the best record of the bunch then Dos. Tre is the last of the 3 new albums released this past year.Tre is the weakest of the 3 cd's. if some of these songs would of been released on Dos then the first 2 albums would of been a great double album and there would of been no need to have a third record.there are a few catchy songs that save the album and make it worthy to buy to add to your Green Day collection. Brutal Love is a nice ballad Missing You is also very catchy and a rocking song Drama Queen has a nice melodie other good songs Sex Drugs And Violence and Xkid are good rockers the rest of the songs are okay to forgettable.the last song try's to hard to sound like a Beatles song .the problem with all these ballads Green Day has written on the 3 new albums is that they are a great rock band and as a longtime fan they are not as great as there early to late 1990's prime albums like Kerplunk Dookie Insomniac all great albums and songs. to me Green Day is a great pop rock band sometimes hard rock nothing more nothing less they are not a power ballad kind of band. I would make a mix cd of all the good songs when you buy or download the albums and you will have a killer cd to listen to. this album gets a 2 rating for the few good songs get Uno and Dos first then Tre last.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Had to force myself to read all three books. Only, because once I start a book I'm going to finish it. Throughout all three books it was more of the same sappy silly nonsense. I felt like I was reading some fantasy book for teenagers.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|I am a huge Chris Cornell fan and have mostly every album he has ever released Soundgarden Audioslave solo etc.I got into Soundgarden when Superunkown was released in the mid 1990's like a lot of music fans that record was all over rock radio and MTV back when they had music video shows and were played all the time.how can anyone not be a fan of his. he is one of the greatest singers in hard rock of the last 20 years.he is a huge influence on lot's of rock singers me included . Nirvana and Pearljam who are two of my favorites of the Seattle rock scene of the 1990's that I love sold more records and had more hits but Chris deserves more attention since his voice is incredible and not a lot of people ever mention what a great musician and songwriter he is besides the singing. I am happy to have any new music from Soundgarden and Chris.I was never a huge Soundgarden fan but a Chris Cornell fan .my favorite records of his singing and songs are the Temple Of The Dog record which is very underated and a great album and the Superunknown album which had a lot of great catchy songs. Louder Than Love and Badmotorfinger which was the first hit album also had great songs on it. the singing is great as always and Chris has not lost that much vocally and the band sounds good the whole album .the  record has a few great acoustic songs which Chris is known for Halfway There should be a big hit very catchy great singing Bloody Valley and No State Actor are old school Soundgarden ,these songs sound like early Soundgarden Badmotorfinger Louder Than Love era music. Been Away To Long is the single and sounds a lot like old Soundgarden as well ,Black Saturday is another song i like .this album is very heavy a lot of the songs are back to the pre Superunknown sound not a classic record by the band but the album is better than a lot of crap passing itself off as music in rock music today so any album by Soundgarden is welcome.any fan of Soundgarden hard rock or metal you won't be sorry pick the album up asap it gets a 4 rating from me!k the album up asap it gets a 4 rating from me!
0618001905|5.0|An excellent if horrific description of the situation in the Congo at the turn of the century.  Over 10 million estimated deaths in less than two decades is appalling, and the Congo was just one African territory where such atrocities occurred during this period.  Such chilling thoughts came over me during the reading of this book, such as perhaps the Africans imported to other continents had it better because at least they were \\"valued\\" at something, as opposed to in the Congo where people were killed over trivial or even non existent offenses?  Where the Nazi-like minds of the colonizers warped by greed or just a sense of superiority and a desire to follow orders?  And lastly, one cannot help but to lament along with the author that so few voices of the Congolese themselves survived this period to tell their own story.<br /><br />An excellent example of how a few steadfast voices can, despite opposition and oppression, make a difference.  And that history will be the judge of one's actions.<br /><br />An important part of history that still has repercussions in today's Congo; a must read.

0920668372|5.0|I purchased this book for my son as a present for his first child.  I would read this frequently (and sing the &#34;I love you&#34; part) to my two boys when they were young.  We still have our copy.  Every once in  a while one of them will still read it. They loved it!  It was a gift from my mother, which she gave to both my sister and myself.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|If G5 keeps comming out w/ games like this, my 5* ratings won't be so rare any more!! Really good story line (at least Somebody is hiring decent writers!), wonderful graphics, fun mini-games that aren't too taxing, HO scenes where you need something in the pile and a mostly intuitive playing mode where it isn't too hard to figure out what to do. If you run into trouble the hints work great! Way to go G5!!! Keep these games coming!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Installed it on a whim,definitely a fun, challenging game. I feel the number of freehints is a little low, but other than that, top notch stuff

B00005V9HH|5.0|The ultimate crime mystery there is, this movie is good on every level.<br /><br />Never have I watched such an intriguing movie. Although the main plot develops slowly, all the sub plots along keep your mind guessing as to what is really happening. You have no idea why they are interrogating Verbal Kent (Kevin Spacey).<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, five thieves find themselves in the same lineup regarding a truck heist in New York. After they are released, they decide to get together for one job, a job that will get back at the cops of New York, and set the sailing off into eternal happiness. To get their payoff they have to go to California. When the person buying the goods offers a few more jobs that are extra juicy, these five thieves can't resist and the jobs that follow make the movie.<br /><br />This is hands down Kevin Spacey's best performance. Him, along with Stephen Baldwin and Gabriel Byrne who also give extraordinary performances make this movie an all time classic as far as crime mysteries are concerned. Superb acting and an even better story line.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, prepare to have your mind blown. If you are just getting it because having this movie for only 5 dollars, I don't blame you, it's too good of a steal to pass up.
0385537670|1.0|it is funny how people all talk about this book, and this book is one of the best seller books. First of all, this book is poorly written with same scene over and over again. secondly,all the plots in the book seems unrealistic and unattractive to the reader. I bought the book, and I gave up at 1/3of the book. To me,this is the book for children teach them if they disobey they will get spank with a lot of sex scences. If you do have too much free time and don't know what to do, buy it. Otherwise, don't even bothered.
0385333846|4.0|Having heard about how great this book was several times, I must say I was let down by it in the end. After all the time travel and visits to Tramalfador, I was expecting a big finish in this book, but nothing ever developed. The plot never resolved.<br /><br />Although I found it to be a let down, I was still happy to have read this. Vonnegut provided many laughs throughout, and maybe if I was paying closer attention the whole way I would have gotten more out of this.<br /><br />The key message does seem to be to not fret about the petty things in life. Billy Pilgrim is a crusader when it comes to not letting things get under his skin, in fact, other people actually get upset with his insane ability to not give a hoot.<br /><br />With that being said, I'm sure this book does offer a lot of things to learn from, but overall, I was let down. Still, if you like time travel and space and World War II stories, check this book out.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Many people hated this movie. Many people also loved this movie.  I had waited and waited to see this movie from the moment I ever first heard about it.  For me personally it didn't disappoint.  It had everything that I had hoped for.  The main thing to understand is that you HAVE to be into this type of science fiction to really enjoy it.  It has horror elements but it isn't really horror.  It also has strong science fiction elements but it isn't your run of the mill sci-fi either.  It is a dark science fiction with a strong lemon spritz of drama added. Science Fiction at it's heart is a brutal analysis of humanity.  This movie has strong hinges on belief, and I feel that is one reason people hate it.<br /><br />Honestly, the movie was very fun and entertaining with many good elements to take from it.  This DVD/Blu-Ray combo is a fantastic way to go if you are wanting to purchase the movie.  It gives you lots of special features and options for watching the film.<br /><br />You have to make a choice for yourself whether this movie is something you like or not.  There is too much of a fuss from critics and fans to rely on reading reviews to find out if you want to see it. As for me, I love it.  As a writing major, I feel it has good examples of structure and story arc.  It is a whole and complete movie that is worth watching.  It will proudly sit on my shelf from now on next to my copy of Alien.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was not one of my favorites by John Grisham but overall, a very clever and entertaining work. It is one I certainly recommend and in fact, have already done so. Maybe we may even see it adopted for the screen. If so, I predict a hit.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|I was sucked in from the first moment. Both being against love and falling completely head over heels for each other.. although it took Connor a while to get it, he finally understood why he'd fought so hard for Megan and in the end isn't that what all us hopeless romantics want?
0156027321|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books. I bought this one for a friend and she is loving it.
B00B1OI3GM|5.0|His first ECM under his own name.  Yikes, it's about freaking time.  Homer is an inexhaustible source of artistic inspiration, and Potter's take is suitably joyous and anguished by turns.  The harmonium (capably tickled by Mr. Virelles) was an inspired choice for setting the mood.  Yoiks, what a bunch of great young players:  Craig Taborn, Eric Harland, Larry Grenadier (does he ever sleep?  He plays on more than 50% of the records I buy).<br /><br />Dancing over architecture;  just git it.  1600 stars.
B000E6EJAC|4.0|Loved this CD, but when it arrived, the case was cracked.  The cd was fine, but this was a gift, with no time to return and replace.  Just glad the cd itself was in perfect shape.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|Unmistakably Stanley, in black and white.<br />Peter Sellers is unleashed, much of the film is him improvising.<br />Forget Patton, this is George Scott's best performance.<br />Sterling Hayden is understated and sublime.<br />Slim Pickens riding the nuke all the way down.<br />YEEE HAAAA!
B00005K3OT|5.0|Excellent!  Love Dame Judith and Juliette in this movie. The story is engaging and you really feel for the people in the various lives being created in the movie. 5 stars
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As the title says this is my second favorite of the three Hunger Games books. It wraps up the trilogy nicely and has a decent epilogue.
B006LSZECO|3.0|well written, but I was expecting a different ending...  It keeps you on your toes as it switches back and forth between charactors..
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun! It was fun enough that I bought the actual version. I forget the differences between the free and paid versions now though.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This is two games in one.  If you love match three games you will love this and has an added bonus with fish tanks you get to maintain.  You earn money by playing the match three game, then you get to stock your fish tanks with the money.  Love this game highly addicting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this is my favorite of the three Hunger Games books. The arena used described in this book is just insane and I can't wait to see it in the movie!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A thriller that follows in true Clancy fashion.  So intense at times I had to put it down for a bit.  Clancy has a knack for creating storylines that are true threats in today's world.  A nail biter!
B006LSZECO|5.0|For me it was a page turner & different, like her other 2 books which also kept my interest. None of her books have a boring moment!  Looking forward to her next book whatever the story =)
0451228375|5.0|I thought World Without End was fantastic. I felt like I was experiencing the war along with the characters. It seemed so realistic. I have recommended the book to several of my friends and will most likely read it again and again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the surprise twist at the end!  Great book that ended with a happily ever after. I think it's his first book where I haven't cried.
B003U74NQW|5.0|Let me start this review by stating I in no way am a sadist or into any strange sexually berative behavior as many reviewers are not and because of that can not handle this film.It is not a film for the sensitive or easily disturbed I don't think any Lynch film is.I am however an avid Lynch fan his films are so original,smart,and just a genre all on their own much like Tarantino and Takashi Miike both of whom have their own genre of film making and are highly controversial because they don't adhere to the mainstream and conventional film's that the mainstream have grown used to.Blue Velvet is an absolute masterpiece it takes small town suburbia and turns it upside down and makes you realize that there is a dark underworld beneath the surface and there are very bad and sick people out there with no redeeming quality's and they're right under our noses.Kyle Maclaghlin,Laura Dern,and Rosselini all do a great job but the show goes to Dennis Hopper who gave us one of the most sick and twisted villians of all film history (FRANK BOOTH). A man ruthless,drug addled,and sexually violent psycho with the the foulest mouth we've heard up till 86.Hopper really becomes this character and it's frightning to the core because he's almost to good at being Booth,the way he huffs on that gas,his expressions,rants,and sexual fetish's are the signs of a raving lunatic who will kill,hurt,rape,torture anyone or anything that gets in his way of getting what he want's as you'll see in the film.Blue Velvet is a noir classic and really put Lynch on the map and brought Hoppers career back.It's not for everyone it's loaded with lot's of the f-word(only Booth uses the word in the film but it's non-stop),graphic violence and weird sexual material but it's a brilliant film from a brilliant unconventional director..Do see...
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I saw this in the theatre and knew I had to have the DVD it is a moving film about man and horse and the love they had for each other during a trying time of war. if only we could emulate this in our daily lives how much better the world would be.<br />Brilliant
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I have absolutely no complaints. This backpack was dirt cheap and works like a champ. I probably will never buy another backpack again, since my back has already gotten accustomed to it!
B0033807C2|5.0|I am a close reader of rick riordan books I think this novel is the best out of the five book series with a twisted ending a fair doce of lovem secretes and the great prophecy that has been haunting us since the first book awesome.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book provided a great background on the lead up to the Osama Bin Laden operation. The eye opening book on some of the military's operations and activities kept me reading the book.  This also provided a lot more detail on the actual situation than I was able to get from the overly sensationalized news reports.

0374531269|4.0|I purchased this book for my sons required reading at his school.  I would suggest it to others to read .
B00A8ZZ2Z0|3.0|I'm 37, so i was a pretty big fan of Helloween back when i was a young kid in the 80's. I started with Keeper of The Seven Keys Part II, one was ok, but i found the production to be a bit bad. I thought Kiske was a good singer, though i was listening to Queensryche as well, so i preferred Geoff Tate to Kiske. After a few years of uninteresting (stupid/silly) type albums i pretty much wrote them off. Then with the release of Master Of The Rings my interested peaked with new singer Deris on board. Which to this day remains one of my favorites, along with Better Then Raw and The Dark Ride. The Time Of The Oath was good but the production was just so convoluted you really couldn't tell one instrument from the other. From 2000 on i liked a few albums but i just started to \\"grow out\\" of the whole \\"power metal\\" scene. Even though they never sung much about warriors, swords and wizards i just couldn't get myself back into the vibe. Seven Sinners certainly didn't help things especially when singing a song like \\"Are You Metal\\"? A bit to Judas Priest for my taste. So i've just heard songs throughout the years.<br /><br />I was pretty psyched to hear this album was better, just from hearing the sound samples. So i gave it a shot. I do like the fact that a lot of the songs were fast, but would have preferred a mid tempo \\"Why?\\" or \\"Hey Lord\\" type song in there somewhere. And \\"Live Now\\" just doesn't live up to the hype of those tunes. A$$hole actually ended up being a strange favorite of mine, probably because i know someone personally that i can dedicate that song to word for word. Other highlights are \\"World At War\\", \\"Burning Sun\\", \\"Waiting For The Thunder\\", \\"Straight Out Of Hell\\" and \\"Another Shot Of Life\\". The other songs are decent, and the only one i totally dislike is \\"Take Me In Your Arms\\", i just really don't like when Andi Deris tries to pronunciate words when he sings softly. As with a lot of foreign singers. The only ballad i've liked form his era was the song \\"Time\\".So all in all this is a good album it's not spectacular, they still have some cheesy parts here and there, and then again some lyrics are more mature than others. As is the same with the songs. So this is one of their stronger albums of this decade, even though i'm getting older and just don't get the strong vibe i use to get, it does make for a few good spins. Glad to see these guys being up in the 40's and still making some strong music. Unlike most thrash bands who have fallen off the grid, Helloween seem to still be kicking strongly. So 3 means good, and this album is just that. ;o)

0446580848|1.0|I had been looking forward to this latest novel by Nelson DeMille, especially since so many had given it a five-star review. With the exception of Gate House (a real stinker), I have enjoyed all of his work....until now. I disliked  The Panther for basically two reasons: 1) One of my favorite characters, John Corey, a formerly witty detective hero, has now totally evolved into a non-stop, wise-cracking smart-ass. At numerous times I found myself saying, \\"Enough already\\". I thought this was supposed to be an action story; 2) The narrative is slow-moving and absolutely tedious. Between the first chapter and the last two, at least a hundred and fifty pages could have been eliminated. Half way through the book, I was tempted to just stop. By that point, however, I thought I had too much invested. But I had to force myself to keep picking the book up. It became painful. At the end I was just glad it was over.

B005K17RU0|3.0|I don't know if it was something in the program or what but everytime I put this on my Kindle the Kindle would completely lock up. The first time it happened I didn't know what app was causing the issue so I reset the Kindle and added 1 app a week to see how it would work. After I added this back on the Kindle locked up again. It gave accurate weather forcasts but wasn't worth the trouble!

B0007MWZEK|5.0|I love my swivel sweeper.  I've bought it for all my friends and they love it too.  When you have tile floors, animals and kitty litter within seconds you can have the floor cleaned up. After charging, I use sweeper until it needs charging.  The charge lasts for many clean ups.  I have bought several &#34;extra&#34; sweepers so no one will be out of a sweeper when it is gives out.

0061537969|4.0|My favorite read of last year.  Purchased copies for my children as holiday gifts.  Highly recommend it to every one
0316224588|4.0|Damn, but I really enjoyed this book.<br />First, I am glad to have Rebus back. And from the sound of things, the retirement age has been extended and I think there may be even more Rebus books. Secondly, I loved the peripatetic nature of the storyline. Rebus was always on the road. The geek in me, of course, looked it all up on Google maps.<br />Thirdly, I loved how Rebus didn't really belong anywhere. The local cold case unit (where he is working as a contractor) is about to be shut down in favor of a national effort. He is seconded to an active murder investigation, still as a contractor, and they don't even find a desk for him. Both of his so-called supervisors are too busy kissing up to the media and their own superiors to provide any leadership.<br />Lastly, I love the Jackie Leven music. And how the book ended with someone standing in another man's grave. So very elegant!<br />Ian Rankin has done it again!
0765325950|5.0|Fell loose from binding but I glued it back ok. The story was great and this writer is very good. Order placed before available, received on date requested.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Totally awesome. Verily tis a mighty sequel to a mighty game. Sorry been rereading old Thor comics. It doth make me verbose.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I was fascinated from the beginning. The story is so well written, the characters so real, the message so important, that I would recommend Wonder to everybody. Being a pediatrician and working in a tertiary hospital, I was in touch with several kids and families with problems like August´s.  I think this book can help to modify the way some people approach children with any special condition. And even more, the way we interact with anybody. Thanks to Mrs. Palacio!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The third volume in the series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is, in my opinion, the best so far. I'm still \\"patiently\\" waiting for the sixth volume in hopes that it won't disappoint me like the fourth and the fifth (which are still waiting to be reviewed). I feel that after writing this incredible, fast-paced novel (\\"A Storm of Swords\\"), George R.R. Martin lost all his inspiration, or suddenly realized he had nothing left to say. I mean, what was that \\"Feast for Crows\\" thing? Anyway, on with the review...<br /><br />Picking up from where \\"A Clash of Kings\\" ended, this book continues the story of The War of the Five Kings for the Iron Throne of Westeros. The war has gone for so long that the land of Westeros cannot take it anymore, and even the kings themselves have grown tired and lost too many men, lands and family members. Stannis Baratheon, Robb Stark and Jeoffrey Barathen (with the help of his mother, queen Cersei, and his grandfather, Tywin Lannister) all struggle to reach a conclusion, be it by making new allies through marriage, by trying to take back what's theirs, in Robb's case, or by magic. And Stannis is the one who decides to make things easier for his cause and let the dark powers of Melisandre kill his enemies one by one.<br /><br />\\"A Storm of Swords\\" is a very powerful novel with many unexpected twists and turns. The characters' struggles have never been so hard and painful. Many of them lose things that made them who they are, that defined them. What I admire most about George R.R. Martin is his ability to make the reader fall in love with some characters only to take them down afterwards, without putting the story in any danger. There are moments in which, you, as a reader, cannot believe that your favorite character, who you considered to be strong and righteous, is actually dying and no one is doing anything about it. But if in most novels this can be a real turn off, in the case of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" you cannot help devouring the next books and falling in love with other characters. After all, you have to admit this is exactly what happens in life.<br /><br />Another amazing thing in \\"A Storm of Swords\\" is that the writer takes the worst villains and dives deep into their past and feelings. What the reader realizes is that these characters were almost (if not entirely) right to act the way they did, hurting the ones around them. There seems to be a good reason behind all their actions and this shows how complex these characters actually are. Being able to see into Jamie Lannister's thoughts will change the reader's opinion about him and the same will happen with Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. From all the characters in the series, Jon Snow is the one who understands how difficult it is to take someone's side because, in truth, all sides are right in their own way.<br /><br />All in all, \\"A Storm of Swords\\" is an amazing read and it has some scenes that will leave you breathless and completely drained of energy. Oh... I remember the battle on the wall! It was 2 a.m., I was having a killer headache from reading for hours without stopping to even catch my breath, and I was clutching the huge, heavy hardback for dear life, my eyes running on the pages at the speed of light. And I kept saying \\"one more chapter and then I'm off to sleep\\". The ending has to be the best cliffhanger ever, and it makes you grab the fourth book and start devouring it. Too bad it doesn't live up to the expectations.d falling in love with other characters.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is really handy.  You can read books on your phone!  Since it syncs with your kindle account, it will move ahead to where you left off reading in the book on your kindle device.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|I bought this game because I kept hearing so many great things about it. And everything I heard was true. Absolutely, positively true. This is THE BEST Vita game I have EVER played and is seriously in my Top 10 for BEST. GAME. EVER. I love the game's vibrant colors, the soundtrack, the characters, and the battle system. I also love the fact that there is SO MUCH to do and so many choices to make.<br /><br />If you have a Vita, buy this game. If you don't have a Vita and you love JRPGS, BUY A VITA AND GET THIS FREAKING GAME~! I cannot stress how awesome this game IS! It's time consuming and for $40, you are practically guaranteed at least 80+ hours, and MULTIPLE PLAYTHROUGHS.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I guess I was expecting Harry Potter quality and it just wasn't there (my opinion at least ). Perhaps it just wasn't my type of story.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Gritty fantasy for the lover of political and military dramas - plus the love scenes don't hurt either. Cast, writing, and set design are incredible.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game completely exceeded my expectations. wasn't very thrillled with the first game but this one is more challenging and definitely more entertaining
B00AQMSJI2|1.0|Pros: Fun pirate gameplay if you can get past the negatives.<br /><br />Cons: There are some issues with game layers. The game angle cannot be rotated. Game lag issues with ship battles. Everything good/effective costs real money or would take a year's worth of diligence playing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is awesome but it needs the 0.6.0 update for kindle fire first gen. I love minecraft it will always be good

B005WUHAX8|4.0|Case seems good and works well.  The one challenge is that you either need to remove the case (not a good idea) or add an adapter for it work with stereo docks.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is a must-read for anyone responsible for IT ops, software development, or information security.  If you are like me you won't be able to put it down!

0765325950|1.0|I'm waiting for the e-book format!!!!! These books are too big to read hard copy, that's why I love the e-readers.

B00008J2PG|5.0|Thought-provoking and inspiring ~ well done movie.  I was surprised at the depth in this movie.  Very compelling.  Thank you, Gregory Peck!

B009DA74ES|5.0|I hope they make more seasons of Californication. I love this show!!! Hank Moody and Charlie Runkle are one of the funniest characters I've seen!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love animals. so this game is perfect for me.  I love horse and this game is so much fun.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I love this album! Emeli Sande Is definitely a breath of fresh air, especially today when a lot of the music doesn't have that much meaning behind it. She's an inspiration.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like how temple run 2 is more hard then temple run. I loved it when I played it and I like how you start off on a zip line!!!!  love it!!!!!!!

0425252868|5.0|A Higher Call is a great read. Adam Makos is a good American author every one should read this book and learn something from it.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|This is a free Kindle trash file remover. It runs quickly and cleans out old WEB files that are taking up space. It also identifies files that have not been accessed in a while that are taking up space. On a new Kindle type machine this is not a big deal but after you load it up with stuff and surf for a while it is a good idea to clean up the system.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Got exactly what I wanted.  A like new DVD set at a great price.  I will be back.  Thanks alot
B0049P1VHS|5.0|My wife and I got hooked on the series on AMC. If you enjoy this type of fiction you'll love The Walking Dead.
0525953728|4.0|No Easy Day is a good, straightforward account of the training and work of Navy Seals, culminating in a firsthand account of the mission that resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden.  With all the debate about the film, Zero Dark Thirty, those who watched it will be pleased to know that Katherine Bigelow got it mostly right although, as is often the case, Owens/Bissonette's account of the raid and its aftermath are better, both from an accuracy and from a dramatic standpoint.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Love the genre. We had to have this after also purchasing Season One and we'll buy Season Three when it is released.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is nice and big and very easy to use.  I use it constantly on my Kindle.  Its great.  Highly recommended!
B0002TJGQS|3.0|The lifetime is relatively short, but given the price its probably worth it. Go for it if you are going to put it into something you are not using heavily.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I have a new found love for Tina Fey after reading this book! Definitely recommend it. It is a must read!
B00000J048|5.0|Helps develop spatial perception and fine motorics. It presents right amount of challenge: the child has to put some effort into assembling, but not enough to discourage him/her. The pieces are of the right size too.
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|Wonderful music and a touching story about a fascinating man. I could hardly believe this unique, talented person has gone unnoticed in the U.S. for so long.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I was beyond excited when I learned that Led Zeppelin was putting out a new album for the first time in over 25 years. To make it all the better, adding Jason Bonham on drums, not to replace his father but to sit in for him, was a bonus. One would think that having not performed together in over 20 years they may lose a bit of an edge. That is anything but the truth. The CD set with some of the best Zep tunes is amazing. The sound seems like they have never taken a break from one another. And then comes the Blu ray disk with the live concert. The energy from Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham is as electrifying as it was in their last US tour in 1977. Without question, Jimmy Page shows why he is one of the most respected and admired guitar players of the rock era. JPJ is one of the most gifted universal musicians ever, be it on the bass guitar, keyboards, mandolin or what have you. Plants voice will dig a hole straight through your soul as he belts out songs like Kashmir, No Quarter and of course, Stairway to Heaven. Seeing Jason Bonham on the drums is a sort of eerie feeling. If you close your eyes for a moment and just listen to his masterful work as a percussionist, you would sear it's his father. In the final&eacute; of Rock and Roll, his short solo, as the other three members stand in front of him and pay homage, is nothing less than genius.<br />My only complaint is that it is not longer, which, like every other Zeppelin concert or album, always leaves you wanting more. Certain songs that are not on here that would have been incredible to see and hear again like The Immigrant Song, some of the acoustic songs (Goin' To California, Four Sticks), The Battle of Ever More, Ten Years Gone and When the Levy Breaks are missing from this incredible compilation but, as I said, it is typical Led Zeppelin that always leaves you wanting more.<br />Overall, this is now entered into my Led Zeppelin discography as another favorite. My hope is that there may be a chance of a new album and maybe even a small tour with this line up. Led Zeppelin always has been and always will be one of the greatest of the greats and they make it true with this set.be a chance of a new album and maybe even a small tour with this line up. Led Zeppelin always has been and always will be one of the greatest of the greats and they make it true with this set.
B005CWRB44|5.0|I've had several different little lights like this that I've carried attached to my key-chain but, I gotta tell ya, this one's my favorite.  I carried it on my key-chain for a while but I wanted to put it to even more use so I attached it to an ID badge lanyard that I need to wear for work.  It's a hefty little mini-light but it's great quality and its light output for its size is amazing.  I use it almost every day (a few minutes at a time) now that I've attached it to my lanyard ... and it's still going strong.  When I need to use it and other people are around, they notice it and are amazed at how much light it puts out for its size.  I am VERY pleased with this little light and I highly recommend it.  :-)
B009DT9ANW|5.0|My wife has been a Peter Frampton fan since day one. This was bought as a Christmas gift to her to celebrate the 35(!) years since the FCA album and it does not disappoint. As hard rockers from the 70's, this will prove to be a valuable asset to any true rock enthusiast. Peter Frampton is one of the timeless classic performers who never gets older, just better with time. I have seen him live through out the United States on numerous occasions and even though it's mostly the same songs we grew up with, his live performances never get old. Add some of his new material (Thank You, Mr. Churchill, which is not on here), and it's always the best sound from one of rock's greatest. Needless to say, my wife loves this DVD/BD. You will NOT be disappointed.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I bought this holster to use with my new Fenix PD32 flashlight and it is absolutely perfect for that light.  The clip is very sure and actually clips AROUND a belt instead of just over it.  It also tends to firmly grip a pocket very well if you choose to go that route.  The holster rotates and &#34;locks&#34; in different positions (such as perfectly horizontal) which can come if VERY handy.  For example, let's say you've got your flashlight in this strapped to your belt on your side.  You need to see directly in front of you but you need both of your hands free.  Well, guess what?  Rotate the holster to the horizontal position, with your flashlight pointing forward, until it locks in that position.  Then, you've got everything in front of you lit up and you've still got both hands free.  The angle of your body changes?  No problem, just rotate the holster to keep the light pointed where you need it.  This holster has no &#34;flap&#34; to hold the flashlight in.  It depends on friction and a tight fit ... and, it can be a very tight fit, depending on the light you're carrying.  But, that's just added security for your light in knowing that you won't lose it.  I think this is a GREAT holster and I highly recommend it.  :-)
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this movie, it was extremely funny and entertaining...I love Rebel, she makes the movie...good flick!!
B0002858YS|5.0|From back in the day when people bought CDs, this one was one of my last CD purchases, and it was well worth it!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi's book is riveting and deals with problems that I don't normally experience.  As usual her handling of the trial is captivating.  I'm beginning to see a pattern in her books although I've only read 3 of them.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|We just love this series.  When we watch it, it is a whole family affair. I would recommend to anyone who likes &#34;geek&#34; humor.  We have all the seasons so far.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest, it's a great place to fine ideas for crafts, decorating your home and do it yourself things!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Loved this book from the first page to the last.  I found myself staying up late into the night because I wanted to find out what happened next and if Harold would make his pilgrimage.  So well written and such an easy read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun game that passes the time in nicely. Good for a break from the routine with multiple ways to play the game.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|It is a pretty case that fits my HD perfectly. The only complaint I have is that it is not easy to flip it to \\"stand up\\" .
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My son was very excited about this item. It arrived in 3 days to Istanbul. The packing of the item was perfect. Although it travelled overseas, it seems like we bought it froma store 5 minutes before.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is pleasing. It causes me joy to watch it. Others should watch it too. Then we will have all watched it.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Not afraid to maim or kill off a few main characters- this helps to make the story line more unpredictable :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this. I love horses and this is like having my own.<br />This game gives you the opportunity to have a horse without actually having one.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Geat read, the author puts a lot of detail into the characters, makes it easy to quickly relate to them.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Great character writing, you begin to even see these characters as real individuals. Complex and very political world. The books are truly about the game of thrones, no character is safe and can die anytime.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Pretty color, good stitching, covers my Kindle like it should.  C'mon people, it's a cover what do you want me to say about it?<br />It works.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Awesome show. Detective show with a twist. Great actors. Not your typical crime scene detective show.<br />Great great great great
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome it should be 5 star.it would be awesome if everyone voted 5 star.and out of all of all the other games it's the best
B0063GORYU|3.0|Naturally there is a better one that I play on my pc<br />but I would recommend to my friends.<br />If it is free we should not complain at all
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I really enjoyed the 2 different versions of the movie. I had already seen the orignal movie.I  appreiated the quick service I received.<br /><br />Thank-You<br />Shirley
B00136JR2M|4.0|classic hip-hop album. must have for those who love this musical genre. ... do yourself a favor musically and pick up a copy here in amazon mp3 ...
B00992CF6W|5.0|How do you update this AWSOME GAME!!!<br />I hope I  can find out can someone tell me through a review?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game.  Great fun.  My daughter can't stop playing this game.  We play together all the time.  You'll love it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Wait never mind. I found out that there was a survival mode. Well it's a great app and its really fun! It's also very adicting and makes you want to keep playing! I also love the new update.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Great app and I believe far superior to the the first. However on my kindle fire the use of gems to save run causes a force close and the loss gem + run score. So for me the game is frustrating at best and unplayable if already in a sour mood. But it's a good game and worth checking out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is so cool much much better than the last one. Its way more creative than the last one too.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Bought this because I love all of Trains songs and I am very happy to say that I love this CD as well.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Pretty good dictionary I wish I could type the word and it would find it but this dictionary is useful
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|My title says it all, its simply beautiful. Will spend many evenings and days humming along to this. I love Andrea Bocelli!!!
B00845PRDS|5.0|Love the movie works great just wish it would download faster than 3 hours it eats up alot of time
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I'll compare the pros in each of the two versions of this game:<br /><br />Computer version:<br />-It's easier to see which Goo you're clicking with a cursor. On android, not only is the display smaller but because it is touch screen, your finger covers your view.<br />-Edge scrolling. On android, to move around the map, you have to &#34;flick&#34; the screen. This might not be a problem for higher end phones but on my G2, the game lags when I try to flick the screen.<br /><br />Android:<br />-You can click everywhere so in a sense, it is more faster than using a cursor.<br /><br />I guess this game is easiest to play on a tablet. You don't have to compromise screen size to take advantage of touchscreen.
B000002KGT|2.0|I bought one of these, and was presented with what seemed to be a foul-sounding early-technology CD.  The ad says that the product here is a 1990 release, which should have sounded better.  The only date on the one I received was the original 1977 copyright date, so I suspect that it was part of the frenzied wave to get 'em out in digital, before people started actually trying to make CDs sound good.  And, consequently, not a 1990 product.<br /><br />For a CD that was this popular and which made as big a mark as this one, you'd think that Amazon and its sellers would have better information.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I laughed till I cried, and then I laughed some more.  The ending was as funny as it gets...Tarantino loves making movies and it shows. Buy this if you have a sence of humor, and if your not too hung up on reality.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is awesome because you can get everything you can on the other versions and now get armor
B005NFJAT4|1.0|The blue ray version stinks. The original widescreen production was chopped to fit the hd size tv's. It loses alot due to the cropped picture. The addition scenes are worthless, and I see why they endeed up on the cutting room floor. I'll give it away and watch my original DVD copy thank you.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This app is awesome! My friend introduced it to me and I was attached to it immediately!! This game is a must have. Believe me I have about 20 apps and I play this 1 most often!!!!! And I am saying again...get this app!!!! :-)
B000I9U8VO|4.0|Great movie, but the sound quality was terrible. I can usually hear great from my laptop, but no matter what I tried, it wouldn't work. I had to plug into good external speakers and crank them up to amplify it enough.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Downloaded this to my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; so that I could then download Flash so I could play YouTube videos and other stuff.  It works well.
B005K17RU0|5.0|HAS OPTIONS TO VIEW RADAR., SHOW EXTENDED FORCAST. OR HOUR BY HOUR FORCAST. ALSO SHOWS ANY SEVERE WEATHER ADVISORIES FOR CHOSEN AREAS
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is the only thing I have found that connects my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; to my computer.  The charging cord included with the purchase doesn't do it.  Turn on your Kindle first, plug it into your computer and Kindle will show up in Computer (PC) with a folder, Internal Storage.  Click that and a whole list of files shows up.  Drag what you want to wherever you want.  If you want to download your own DVDs to your device so you can watch them on planes who don't just give you Wi-Fi, get the DVD Catalyst, $9.99, online.  It includes Kindle on its list to transfer movies so you don't have to guess.  Worth every penny.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this one! I can't believe how fast I read it. There was never a dull moment. Also a great little surprise to the ending!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This was actually better than I thought it would be.  The plethora of characters is good.  Even ScarJo was good.  RD Jr. is the best.
B004G600A4|5.0|I bought this DVD to have at our home when the grandchildren visit.  It is a favorite of our three year old twin grandkids, but I must admit that I enjoyed watching it with them.  I appreciated some of the dialog on a more adult level than the kids and had some good laughs.  The qualityof the video and sound are top notch, as should be expected,and Amazon's price ws verzy competitive.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I like Colin Farrell...and would like to see him in more movies.  Perhaps not this one.  His movie star quality was lost in this garble of the original.  Too many special effects and not enough character development.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|The D to A converter was purchased to convert the digital audio output from my TV to analog stereo input for my &#34;old fashioned&#34; stereo amplifier.  The unit was very easy to connect and works perfectly.  It is very small and sits unobtrusively in the back of my entertainment center.  As a bonus, it is powered by a USB port on the TV, so it does not need the USB power supply that came with it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Have this on my computer, iPhone and PC.  Drag stuff to whatever file you want to create on Evernote and it syncs with your other stuff.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Worked out quite well. Great series!!! Highly recommend!!! Try it you may like it!!! Have a blessed day!!! Thanks !!!
B009JZPH32|5.0|All the characters are great.  Blake Lively and her cohorts are sexy and extremely watchable.  Travolta plays a crooked cop well.  Benicio is great in anything.  The Savages part is interesting.....who calls who a savage and why.
1574216988|4.0|My first time drawing tangles and the book was helpful because I do not have any art experience in drawing
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Love Brad...no matter what he does.  He plays exasperated well.  Overwhelmed and with odd habits.  Carries a certain intensity that the movie needs.  It was well done.
B001NLKT60|4.0|wish more conclusions could have been made before this one cut out but a great read nonetheless. The whole trilogy was amazing
B008Y6S4XM|4.0|This is a campy-type, hero wisecracking, good guy who was framed type of movie that really is funny in parts.  Maggie Grace is miscast.  Outer atmosphere prison.  Great setup.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|The man who would become our POTUS shares his thoughts, dreams, insecurities, and convictions with us on his journey of self discovery.  We learn that we all are the same in spite of our culture or color of skin.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Don't download this unless you have days to spend doing nothing but laughing.  I do so it wasn't a problem.
1616550414|5.0|While I haven't kept up with the series all too well, anyone who absolutely loves the series needs to get this book.<br /><br />Pros<br />+Excellent paper quality. I have other art books from Dark Horse and you can immediately tell that they definitely gave the Hyrule Historia a really nice treatment.<br />+Lots of art from the newer games, especially Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess. There's a lot of concept art to be found in this section.<br />+A complete history, in chronological order, of the series. Tons of spoilers in this section if you, like me, haven't played some of the older games.<br />+The short manga included gives a good insight to what happened before Skyward Sword.<br /><br />Cons<br />-While there is a ton of art on the newer games, older titles have less concept art and have mainly just official artwork that can be found online. I would have loved to see more concept art for these and not just the new titles.<br /><br />Even with this small complaint, I HIGHLY recommend any fan of Zelda to get this absolute beast of an artbook!
B007EDYN36|5.0|This book gave a lot of insight to the beginning and evolution of KISS. I had been a KISS fan until I actually read the book. Now it's difficult to remain a fan knowing how obnoxious, money-hungry, and selfish Gene Simmions actually is. I have a new found appreciation for Peter Criss.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway suffers is awesome and I love the world tour because we get new people and we gent New boards
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love it its great for getting up early in the morning and to check the weather awesome app it rocks
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is perfect for people who like games it is so worth it so get it and enjoy playing everyone
1451695195|5.0|This book  gave my belief  that there is something greater than we are and over time we will know that we are all one big family
B00957T6X6|5.0|It's been what seems years since I read a book I was unable to put down... on more then a few nights after turning page and page I look at the clock and its near 1am.. having to be at work at 5am I like my sleep but it is well worth it. Not to mention in most of my dreams now I'm riding to war with Rob Stark to spill the life blood of the Lanisters!!!!! Great book so much better then the JOB series which is great itself!
0316044695|5.0|It put a human face on courage and sacrafice by our military.It also showed how thws young men were betrayed by those they counted on
1616550414|5.0|I got this book as an early Valentines Day gift, and I absolutely adore it. It has everything you would want to have in a book as a Zelda fan: Great art (from the game as well as sketches) and information regarding every game's story/enemies/characters thus far (including the timeline). Even if you already know everything there is to know about Zelda, it is still an enjoyable read, and the artwork is just stunning. For the price I paid ($24 with 2 day shipping) it was worth every penny, and I can't recommend it more. Also, if you have the Zelda Royal Crest black clinch bag (also found on Amazon) the book fits perfectly in it. (:
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A very well written and gripping story<br />Could be one of his better stories<br />Could not put the book down until the end<br />No rambling just to fill space like many other writers
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I would recommend this book to young adults, and readers who enjoy a little romance mixed into the story. I really liked the book and the characters.
630471193X|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing. If you haven't seen it, then you have to. It's really touching. Sad. 5/5. .
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the great updates on this site.  We had thunderstorms and very bad weather yesterday and I was able to keep up witih it on your site.  Thanks.
B00005JLZN|5.0|I had been searching for this movie for a long time because I just love it and my girlfriend had never seen it so I wanted her to see it. And then I found it on here. Great movie. 5/5.
B009ACK1AS|1.0|This was made for European machines.  Can't watch it (very sad).  Don't buy this if you don't have the right equipment.
B00800WIK2|5.0|NICE CONVERSATION PIECE  I DONT WANT TO OPEN IT MY KIDS LOVE IT FAST SERVICE THANK YOU IT IS A COOL ITEM
B003VIWO9I|5.0|After reading a few chapters of &#34;I Shall Wear Midnight&#34; I found myself flipping to the cover to verify it was indeed written by Terry Pratchett.  Not because the style was wrong or it doesn't sound like him... but because things were happening that weren't Land-of-Oz strange or &#34;lol&#34; funny.  No, things were happening (or were described but happened earlier) that were awful -- and there was no poking fun about it: bad things happen, sometimes very bad things.  And if you're the Witch, you have to deal with them, too.  In other contexts I might not have noticed (i.e., that's life), but running into them in a Tiffany Aching book took some getting used to.<br /><br />Once I did, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  But it was definitely a shift to see darker, more mature issues arise... and to watch Tiffany handle them.  The rest of what I wanted to discover was all there: excellent storytelling, character development, doses of humor, and plenty of other Discworld characters to marvel/chuckle/cheer at.  Mrs. Proust was great, almost as entertaining as Wintersmith's Miss Treason.<br /><br />I definitely recommend the book  Fair warning, it has the most potent examples of &#34;humanity's inhumanity to man&#34; on the Disc, and in the YA series to boot.  On the other hand, maybe that's the point...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love how intense it gets the power the thrill and how adicting it is makes my brain and eyes really concentrate on the obstacles and always different track to run in
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Besides giving viewers an intriguing window into the class-conscious society of the early 1900s and the frivolities and abuses that were sometimes a part of that system, the variety of characters and inter-relationships mirrors life in any time period. The plot gradually builds to the shocking murder and then coasts to the poignant finish, which never fails to bring me to tears every time I watch this. As a mom, I find the final parting very sad, and wish there were a sequel to give us some hope that these characters meet again and share love.
1475143389|5.0|Plowed through the book in one evening.  Went back through and highlighted alot of things.  Currently carry it in my workout bag to refer to as needed.  Good read and some great information if your looking to get into shape for the summer!  Rocommended for sure.
B007THA4FI|3.0|J.K. definitely knows how to write a novel. This book was good, but a little predictable. Had her usual wit, overall a good read.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This music is wonderful.  After seeing the movie, the music really takes you back into the story.  Haunting and beautiful.  Love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best! its so realistic! I love how u get to take care of the horse and are able to compete in contests. and its cool how you can have more than one horse and everything. I highly recommend this game to the people who love horses. I know that you may not want to havento pay for the Jens but at after every level it givesnyou one FREE gem! totally love this game!!

B00AEBB9O6|4.0|This review is for the blu-ray transfer only, and not the film itself.  This edition of We Were Soldiers is problematic.  It is excessively grainy and gritty, and does not have the level of detail that one normally expects from a blu-ray.  The colors are strong in the nighttime scenes, but the daytime shots look washed out at times.  I am not a sound expert, but the battle sounds were realistic enough for me, so no problems there.  It is a shame this picture was not given better treatment, because it is a good movie.<br /><br />My four-star rating is for the movie.  The blu-ray transfer by itself would only get two stars.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD to blu-ray, sadly, you will probably want to pass on this one.  Perhaps the studio will remaster it and do a better job sometime in the future.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love the fact that you can still use it even when you're not connected into a WiFi. Definitions are easier to understand compared to other dictionary app. It's listed as one of my most used and fave app in my kindle fire hd!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I absolutely love the Pendergast series. The description of Agent Pendergast's devastation when he loses his wife for the second time is so palpable. Very enjoyable, can't wait to find out what happens next!
0743270754|3.0|It is a book for history buffs.  For many readers (including me) the overall meaning is somewhat lost in the mass of sometimes what seems to be irrelevant detail.  The genius of Lincoln's ability to bring people together, to cajole rather than bully,  to make compromises with the goal of &#34;overall&#34; good and sometimes lost in the plethora of details.<br />The book is very worthwhile as a resource and also as a novel, but could beneift from careful &#34;pruning&#34;.
1449410243|5.0|Bought this for my son's birthday (a cat lover) and provided great entertainment for him and the whole familly asw we read through it.  Funny and clever ... recommend the book!
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I've used TeamViewer on my desktops for years, and now I have full access to my computers from my smartphone.  It is easy to use, and great for staying in touch with the home computer when on the road.  The control on the smartphone can be tricky because of the size, but it works fine once you get the hang of it.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to remotely access any computer.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Just enough legal content and intrigue. We look forward to each episode.<br />Excellent characters and actors. I do think, however, that the Kalinda and her husband thing has run it's course.<br />Not a big thing. We still enjoy the show immensely.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Jeff did it again! The third wheel was an exciting add on to the wimpy kid series. It provided plenty of laughs as did the other books in the series. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I look forward each week to the new episode.<br />The actors are excellent and so believable. The attention to detail is amazing.<br />A must see!
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Many of the song selections didn't fit Ms. Boyle's talent.  Her voice really soars with the &#34;big&#34; songs and there weren't enough of those on the CD.  It sounds like the producers were trying to make Ms. Boyle's voice sound sexy or &#34;kittenish&#34;.  I guess it's good to try new things but I miss her big sound.

B00403CLK0|5.0|Karherine Jenkins is the worlds best singer. I never get tired of listening to her on YouTube.com My favorites are Come What May sung at Royal Albert Hall where she is easily one of the worlds most beautiful women in an evening gown. My other favorite is when she sings with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Her voice is fantastic and she is extremely beautiful. This DVD is well worth watching as is everything she does. The only complaint I have is she doesn't make enough DVD's because I would buy every one.
B004132HZS|5.0|This BBC series is spectacular.  I have definitely been &#34;SHERLOCKED&#34;.  The nice thing is that you can watch it over and over because the Sherlock character talks so fast!  Watching it again is just as enjoyable because you always hear something new you may have missed the first time around!

0679411585|5.0|I love the movie and this book is even better than it.  Hal Morris was an awesome leader and tells a great story.  The way the enemy retreats to the safe havens of another country reminds me of OEF....very frustrating

B004TACMZ8|1.0|I love Bosch tools.  I Have just about every 18V tool they make plus a few other corded tools.  I had a stud finder that worked \\"OK\\" but wanted to try something else.  I ordered the Bosch GSM120 thinking it would be a quality piece of equipment.  I was so wrong.  This thing couldn't find a stud in a lumber yard.  I tried on several occasions and it was just to inconsistent.  It would beep on and off across a wall displaying stud, non-ferrous, electrical, etc.  The manual states trying 3 passes to find a stud.  Each pass put the center of the stud 1\\"-2\\" in either direction.  I finally went back to my old stud finder which seems to work great now compared to this unit.  Thanks to Amazon I am returning this one.  So disappointed.

B00001W9G0|5.0|the story was one which touched your mind. A love story between two people who was not suited but still had feeling about each other. We have all been there.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Great image and very realistic. Keeps you busy when there's nothing to do. I like that you don't need to buy things with real money to advance
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|I am in the process of reading this on my Kindle,( which i do love, by the way).  I love big old books that last a long time, and this one is pretty good. The premise is interesting, because the person living the story is able to go back in time to try to prevent the assassination of President Kennedy. Changing history is very tricky because sometimes changing one little thing affects other things which should be left alone.<br />So far, the story is keeping my interest, but it is not a book which I can't put down.  I prefer Stephen King movies to his books.<br />But I would say this is one of his better books, and I look forward to seeing how the story ends.
0307455874|5.0|President Obama has a way with words, It was a very interesting and informed book. I  look forward to reading his books.

B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Just finished the first season and moved on to the 2nd.  It has nothing to do with the first, but some of the actors/actress's have returned from the first season.  This series is refreshing to watch, and i'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys thrillers/horror movies/tv shows.
B000056BB3|1.0|The reason I hate this product is NOT because of the movie, or I never would have ordered it.  I received a BLANK disk on both sides!  Beautiful, authentic looking packaging, but no moveie at all. I hope this is a mistake and not a fraud issue.  Don' buy from this seller.
B006TGWY3K|5.0|I have a lot of this bands music, but the way they've been going the last few albums reaches its peak in this one to me!  Its hard to explain, but if you have a hint of liking this band, then definitely get this album!<br /><br />If anyone likes Evanesence, i firmly stand by that Lacuna Coil blows them out of the water!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|British Comedy at its best. Very funny & most episodes have quite a twist to them & Laurie & Fry are the best comedy pair.
0547569653|4.0|The book came with many recommendations.  It is a quick read - coversationally written.  Jureker is a genetic freak of a runner.  While his training and attitude helped,  he was winning at distances that were crazy.  I was looking for more a tie between his nutrition and performance and he wrote of that but my desire was probably leaning toward the clinical understanding.  Great runner, great reflections, quick read and the recipes are interesting.  I will eventually attempt to recreate his end of chapter suggestions.  The glossary citing studies and supplemental reading was helpful as well.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|An American version of British Comedy at its best? Very funny & easy to see why the series lasted so long. Worthy of being watched over & over again on long cold winter nights & without all those stinking commercials!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really enjoy this app. My only compliant is that if I leave the app and go back to it I often get a message that reads \\"magic puzzles has stopped working\\". I click ok and it automatically restarts with lost but I have to go through all  selections to get back to my puzzle. Not a big deal but a hassle.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|I've read every Baldacci novel and usually love them but I had a hard time finishing this one.  About half way through it just seemed to go round and round and round.  Not what I'm used to with this author.  In my opinion, he seems to be weaving a political and environmental agenda  into his latest books.  I would have given it one star but can't really say I &#34;hated&#34; it but certainly did not enjoy it.
0545265355|5.0|I am very happy with this boxed set. It is very durable and nice looking sitting on the bookshelf. Also it was a great read..
0765325950|2.0|*spoiler* The book focuses on characters that were periphal to the story. The last battle lasted 200 pages and was extremely repetitive. New information that wasn't discovered by the characters was just thrown in randomly (callendor has a random flaw that allows the dark one to take control of them....err what?). It dragged so long, it had characters I didn't care about, and I didn't agree with how they ended  Rand's story. It just didn't feel right. I got some closure but there was a lot more a story to tell and the good guys only sort of one, but I can't help but feel sad by this amazing story, with the terrible ending that dragged over five books or so.    This series taught me to wait until a series is done and then read it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey and am excited to now have the DVD's to watch anytime I want!  Popping these into my portable DVD player and watching them while sitting on my front porch this summer is going to be a real treat!  Thanks!

B005FJ7DOM|4.0|its the road meets zombie vampires its a really good movie that suprisingly didnt get more notice its dark and gritty and while the main character is a young guy you cheer for the older one cause it looks like he's been thru hell and he doesnt expect to be climbing out any time soon the story is provacative and while the one of the parts at the end i didnt understand at all (i'm not sayin anythin cause i hate when people do that to me with movies i've never see)andit seemed illogical to me but i liked it overall what i think it lacked was a more sound ending it was close just maybe not close enough and what most people don't know is creating an enjoyable satisfying ending is the hardest part i can say oh well it shoulda ended like this or they should have done that but write yourself a story and then show me the ending ill tell what it shoulda been

0425263916|3.0|\\"Bared to You\\" is \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" with marginally better writing and a more palatable heroine, minus the S&M. This second book in the Crossfire Series isn't quite as good as the \\"Fifty Shades\\" sequels or \\"Bared to You.\\" If you liked the first book, \\"Reflected in You\\" is definitely worth the five minutes it takes to read, but it's not as hot as the first, the characters become less appealing (because of the cyclical nature of their \\"fiery\\" relationship), and the writing is more uneven. That said, I'll definitely read the third.
B000FC10WU|3.0|Not overly exciting. It was just ok. Just received my Kindle for Christmas and saw this book that looked somewhat familiar so I ordered it.

1616550414|5.0|Dark Horse has put out some pretty amazing graphic collections lately and this is no exception.  This is a wonderful item that is well appreciated by an old Zelda fan like myself.  The original Legend of Zelda is the game that got me hooked on video games (thanks a lot!) I remember as a kid, thumbing through the comic/story section of the Zelda manual so much that I wore it out!  Now, 25 years later, we have one of the most iconic and enduring video game franchises rivaled only by Mario and Final Fantasy for longevity, popularity, and recognition.<br /><br />First of all, this sucker is heavy, nearly 4 pounds.  It has nearly 300 pages, and is a pleasantly large 12.3 x 9.5.  What this means is that it is a very good size for viewing the art and photography.  The pictures are clear and the included drawings and notes are very nicely done.  Obviously the artists at Dark Horse have digitally covered and written many notes in English, since it would be tough to have to read Japanese.  But it seems they kept the style of even the penmanship close to the Japanese (and I mean the color of ink/pencil, line thickness, cursive notes for when kana was used, etc...).  I like the attention to detail, though they could have also included captions under the drawings notating what the characters translate to in English.  Still, I'm happy.  At least they didn't leave it all in Japanese with no translation!<br /><br />My one complaint (a small one) is that a great deal of content is put aside for Skyward Sword.  At times this does read like a commercial for the upcoming game.  Granted, the folks at Nintendo want people to know about it (and since this is a translation of the Japanese version - we have to understand that they put it together).  I just wanted folks to know.  Though I would rather it be included then have it cut thereby reducing the number of pages.  I just would have liked a bit more content for the first 3 games.  Gladly though, the book designers didn't acknowledge those CD-i Zelda games!<br /><br />For the $21 price tag this is a no brainer.  It will probably sell out at some point and go up in price from third party sellers, so get it now!<br /><br />Also a note: My copy came with a plastic wrapping, but there were still several marks and indents from handling and shipping.  So if you are going to collect this and read it with plastic gloves and such, then you might want to buy a copy in person somewhere where you can visually inspect the book.  It's still in good condition, but not 'Mint' condition.  But I don't care since I plan on reading the hell out of this.ose CD-i Zelda games!<br /><br />For the $21 price tag this is a no brainer.

B00571F26Y|1.0|Another loser diet plan.  Kept to it very strictly.  Didn't lose a pound, in fact gained. Not worth the money to buy the book.
0061692034|5.0|Somehow novelist Richard Ford, whose books I've read for years, manages to hold our attention when nothing much happens for scores of pages at a time while we wait for the disaster explicitly foretold on the first page of his latest novel, \\"Canada,\\" to unfold. It's not that we can't look away from this train wreck; it's that we can't look away when we know that a train wreck's bound to happen somewhere down the line. In fact, it's like we're riding in that train along with the book's then 15-year-old narrator, named Dell, and the other three members of his ill-fated family. We could get off at any page, but our anxiety over the fate of the faux-naive narrator, his fraternal twin sister and mismatched parents is a kind of psychic glue. While we wait for the other shoe to drop after learning of the parents' absurd criminal plan, we share the narrator's agonizing tension.<br />  And then, of course, as the narrator tells us in the same hopelessly understated tone, also at the novel's very start, \\"there were the murders.\\"<br /> The family is living in a small city in Montana after Dell's father quits the military over the discovery of his small-time scam. Without the old military-base connection, the family has no reason to be in this place; or perhaps any place. Dell's father is the family's central problem, his character flawed by by his inability to see that his friendly \\"Southern\\" personal charm will not by itself overcome his catastrophic failures of judgment, such as his belief that his small-time con games will have no ill consequences simply because he cannot see around his own ever hopeful, delusionary temperament to face the world clearly. Dell's mother, a committed loner and deluded in her own way, doesn't want her children to \\"assimilate\\" into the low-level culture around them.<br /> The book's great accomplishment is telling this story from the point of view of a persuasively typical American boy of the late Fifties with no one to rely on but his ill-matched parents and his more perceptive, but cynical sister. Dell just wants everything to work out OK; the anticipation of starting high school is enough to keep him going. He's the kind of kid who studies chess books in the hope of making friends with the guys on the chess club. It hurts to see any part of yourself in any of these characters. His sister is the kind of unhappy adolescent girl who's already discovered the other town misfit and is planning to run away with him, even before her parents' absurdly ill-considered crime venture brings the roof down on top of them all.<br /> Ford manages to spin his tale through Del's narration -- recollected in some tranquility decades later, while keeping the feel and tone of thoughtful but unsophisticated adolescent consciousness -- as the boy reconstructs what happened, what he was thinking then, what his parents must have or might have been thinking in a factual, reflective manner that keeps the reader waiting for what might appear to be an ordinary American family to hit a bridge abutment (metaphorically speaking) at 60 miles per hour.<br /> And after it happens, Dell's life gets worse, and weirder. Then comes the \\"Canada\\" part of the book, and given the title you can't say you weren't warned. The still hopeful, still remarkably self-reliant Dell endures loneliness, material squalor and emotional privation, while landing, through circumstances bearing that same train-wreck anticipation of inevitability that carried us through the first part of the novel, in the clutches of a deranged Ivy League dropout whose self-delusions make his own father's inadequacies seem benign. His parents still in jail back in the States, and his sister off on her own weird trip, as Dell's new life begins in a Saskatchewan ghost town, any reason-loving reader such as my wife would be justified in throwing her hands up and complaining \\"this is a whole other story!\\"<br />  But even as we know there's another disaster looming -- bearing down on us like a 10-ton truck on a lonesome Canadian prairie highway -- most of us are unable to tear our eyes away.<br /> Like all really good works of fiction -- the best ones, maybe -- the subject of this novel is human existence. It remains an inexhaustible subject. \\"Canada\\" says what it says about what matters to us in a peculiar way that is all its own, because it has to.ike a 10-ton truck on a lonesome Canadian prairie highway -- most of us are unable to tear our eyes away.<br /> Like all really good works of fiction -- the best ones, maybe -- the subject of this novel is human existence.

B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is amizing on Pc but this version of minecraft is like a mini bite sized minecraft that can be played on a car trip for example so it is worth the seven $ this is a must buy app!!!!!
B009E3EXMU|4.0|Been a fan of LZ since I first heard them. Looked forward to hearing what they sound like after many years. Well leave it to the techies. The show DVD was extremely difficult to watch with the jumping from of one view to another. Never had motion sickness. But, I could not watch for extended lengths of time. Then, I slipped in the rehearsal DVD which was shot from just a few cameras. The rehearsal was much more enjoyable to watch and I'll watch this again. I agree with many other comments about the need to re-edit the show DVD.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Fun game I suppose, but I tired of it pretty quickly yep... dunno what else to say on that. (keystroke)
B000LTAY1U|5.0|The watch if perfect, nice and light. finishes are excellent, The only thing will be if you have big hands it is a little small (37 mm wide) but in my case is just perfect.
B004WGGQPQ|2.0|But I guess it does what its supposed to, its like a better version of kid pix (if anyone remembers that program)
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I purchased this game for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas. It is actually a fun game for all ages. It reminds me of the game Pictionary, but instead of drawing you build until someone guesses what it is and correctly matches it to your word card. Anyone who likes to play with Lego's or build would love this game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a fun interactive game that teaches you the joys and responsibilities of keeping a horse, and it can help you teach and train your horse
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I bought this Nerf Blaster for my 13 year old son for Christmas and he loves it. He said it is the most accurate of all her over 35 Nerf blasters so far, hitting its target every time. It blasts out a lot of darts one after the other and the name really does fit the description, it is a hail fire of darts. Additional cartridges of the Nerf darts can be added to the ones included with the blaster. My son is very happy with this blaster.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game was expecting the opposite reply  to add more details and.I think it is awesome but I think that you should like  ummm...  oh yeah  like just I like the rainbow hoarse
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this game thinking it was gonna be another knock off of temple run.but it's so much better! When I was playing temple run it lagged and messed up my devise.but subway surfer is completely better.No comparison!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Had to keep reading them all can't wait for the movie! I hope I hope they pick someone sexy for christened character and they use all three books for the movie.
159562015X|5.0|A can't miss buy!  I think it is money well spent, as long as the codes for taking the test hasn't been used previously...
1455523550|5.0|The book was great, much better than I think the movie will be! It was an easy read and I hated having to put it down. I bought it in New condition and it arrived as such. I was very pleased!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game I  amazing considering the fact that it is free of charge. The world tour edition is so cool and original because after a certain period of time the destination like I started off with it taking place in New York city and now it's set in the city of Rio with Palm trees e.t.c I d not know what it will be next but I can't wait. You should definitely download this because otherwise you are missio out on a great game.
B00785P2QC|4.0|If you like all those Facebook games this  ones perfect for you. Ever  day you can add more to your town.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is an excellent game to play although I believe it could do with a few more upgrades.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super fun game I love it <3 made all my friends play. Now I have my family playing. Good times lots of fun with friends and family.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this on my Kindle FIre to keep tabs on battery usage. It does the job and is simple and quick.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great flick.  Love the singing.<br />I play the last few seasons repeatedly just to hear their voices.<br />Enjoy the music,
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I love that watch.<br /><br />It is elegant and raw at the same time, I did plan to change the strap and finally changed my mind and decided to keep it for its raw aspect. The dial is nice and simple and the date is not intrusive. It keeps time well so far (I have it for 4 days only).<br /><br />I hope it will last long, but it is a Seiko, so normally it is very reliable.<br /><br />My wrist is 7 inches, no size problem maybe if you have a larger wrist, let's say 7,5 inches and more, maybe you could find it a little bit small.<br /><br />That's it !
B001MRMRS8|5.0|Orchestra, singers (Netrebko, Villazon, Hampson), setup... By far the best Traviata ever!<br />If you are new to opera, start with this one but be advised that all other Traviatas will look poor.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was the only best thing of my life.I will never had a nice<br />K one like that one ever.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this game. I play it on my kindle fire. Even my kids enjoy it. It was a good choice.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I think that its ok but you cant wear any armor yet until they update it so mojang update please and I will like it a whole lot more.
B005KELW26|5.0|My husband picked this out for me. It fits great and it is purple.  Very functional and getting lots of use
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting i couldn't stop playing it once i got it i could not stop.it is way better then the first one.

0345522478|5.0|This was one of those thoroughly enjoyable books, that was tough to put down.  The characters were delightful and rather unique, and I am so thrilled ... that this is just the start to a entire series.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this game. I play it on my kindle fire. Even my kids enjoy it. It was a good choice.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent!!!! Mr. King has revived the past for me and allowed my imagination to run wild. I like the conspiracy angles.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I saw the movie about him.  The soundtrack was amazing, and I wanted his music! I hope he's not too old to make more!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|I was looking for a good all-around media player but there are no drivers for playing video for Kindle Fire. I tried using the direct link to Google Store as well as the link to the aVia site. The link on the aVia site goes to a dead page so I have removed this program.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Same as for Cold Fact. I wish someone had recognized him when he was younger. H might have been a star.
B00AG51V8E|2.0|COLD LIGHT OF DAY is one of those mindless action films that depends on numerous car chases, government deceptions and a normal guy suddenly becomes an action movie hero.  Possibly the studio's ploy to introduce Henry Clavill, their new Superman???  Shamelessly promoting Bruce Willis as a star when he gets bumped off very early?  And shame on Sigourney Weaver for running around with an Uzi, showing no signs of her iconic Ripley or any signs of her acting finesse.<br />COLD LIGHT OF DAY is purely a distraction aimed at testosterone junkies.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|When I first saw the number of pages, I wondered if this would be worth the time. But I can say it certainly is worth the 500+ pages. The author really does good character studies and the narrative flows so well, even going back and forth in time and telling the different stories of the characters.  It is a well written book with suspenseful areas but the mysteries take second place to the characters and the well described backgrounds provided between a gothic castle and London during World War ll. Tom's feelings especially about his war experience and then meeting Juniper was very moving
B008P1EWIM|2.0|I have had a problem with this app.  When I open app after kindle has been shutdown, it opens to my clock screen with nothing more on it.  I try to change to another view, but I'm unable to.  I've tried erasing the app and reloading it.  When I do this the app is operational, but as soon as I shut down and try loading it again I'm back to my original problem, and its getting old.
0345803485|1.0|I am a man,age 42.I downloaded this book to see what all the fuss was about.I am not prude by ANY means but I was still prepared to be blown away becuase of what I heard at the water cooler.Not only was this book poorly written but EXTREMELY BORING.There is such a thin plot for a 385 page book.And what's with all the pages of silly emails?WHO THE HELL EMAILS ANYMORE!!!!!This guy give her a top of the line MAC and they don't even use facetime for their sexcapades?No Iphone either,nor texting or sexting?Just silly one sentence emails.I truly hated this book.And the fact that they downplay Anna's potential rape by a friend is mind boggling.Why would women want to read that?I can't be the only person to see this.This book is total garbage.I soo wanted to like it but you don't have to be a women to understand that the author was clueless to American culture and had no idea what she was talking about.
B00114RKT8|5.0|Many have completely misunderstood this movie.  It's not about John Newton, it's about William Wilberforce.  It's not about those who are inferior to others, it's about those who think they are superior to others.  Be careful of the opening few minutes, they are filled with emotional pain if you are an animal lover.  This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun for sure but im to good at it. wasddtghbhjjjn huiohttf gyhhujgff gggdftyjj yutrdffg fghjj ghhjj yuioo ewwwsdgvbh bhjj
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|Typical Tarantino music selection, combined with unique packaging and supplemental materials inside. Does not disappoint. Plus I got the MP3 version for free.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Easy to play, fun and very smooth on kindle hd .  Controls are fluid and easy to use! Definitely recommend this game
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Even though I consider myself to be a big Beatles fan I never much cared for Let it Be.  Like many people I  just didn't like the Phil Spector orchestrations and chorus found on several of the tracks.  I didn't like the banter that started off or ended some of the songs, either.<br /><br />But Let it Be...Naked gets it right. This is how the album should have sounded in the first place, a stripped down, no-frills affair that would have contrasted nicely  with the slick productions that were Sgt.Pepper's and Abbey Road.  Unlike the original Let it Be album I find myself listening to all the songs on Naked over and over again, including  and especially The Long and Winding Road, a song I seldom played at all in the past, never mind several times in a row.<br /><br />The second disc is also worth checking out. I thought it would be just a lot of boring in-studio talk, but it 's more of a well-crafted sound collage, one that is strongly reminiscent of the White Album's Revolution # 9.<br /><br />So there you have it, a review that, unlike many reviews of this album, comes right to the point and is not  impossibly long or difficult to make sense of.  My only criticism would be that the booklet should have contained more photos of The Beatles. There's a lot of text but not enough pictures, IMO.<br /><br />It took over 40 years but Let it Be finally sounds the way it ought to! Thanks to all who made it a reality.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a very fun game for people and horse lover's of all ages a n d  y e a h !
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun little pastime, although I think my Kindle Fire wasn't the best choice of platform. It would be far better on an iPad, I believe, with the larger screen.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|My newphew downoaded this app and he likes it alot. I looks interesting and productive. This app is intended for younger kids.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Super game for an old man's brain! I really enjoy matching the tiles. It works very well on my Kindle Fire.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|this product  I was looking for something and this was not what I was looking for. this product is still good.

B002M5E2DW|5.0|It gives you insight and helpful insight day to day. Authors who gives you great solutions to solve everyday life.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Easy read and I would recommend this book for young adult and up.  It was exciting through most the chapters and loved the ending.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|This book inspires you to be a better person and gives you guidelines to follow and practices to use. Thought provoking.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|The case is made of plastic which keeps it lightweight. I believe it to be sturdy and it should stand up against the rigrs of travel and two children using it. The only thing I wish it had is a VGA input also. I have two Xboxs without HDMI connections and it sure would be nice if I could hook it up with VGA instead. For those of you that don't know, the VGA adapter producing a high quality picture too!<br />I've been eyeballin this case for a long time and when I saw it at the Amazon Warehouse in &#34;Like New&#34; condition for $130 I jumped on it and I am glad I did. I had a hard time parting with $200 bucks for this since that is the cost of an Xbox by itself. Anyhow, I recommend to anyone that can find a legitimate use for this case to buy it too!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|facebook lets you keep up with your friends and family anywhere you go. Keeps you posted on info and whats going on in their life.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|Well, its Facebook. And as long as Facebook is up and running, this app works just fine. Clean interface and the usual.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I am a LOTR fan and am now a Hobbit fan too :). Howard Shore has done it again.  The theme music for the Dwarfs is very fitting.  The added cuts (Erabor, Blunt the Knives, The Dwarf Lords, The Edge of the Wild, and A Very Respectable Hobbit are wonderful. also the extra material included is nice too, however not impressed with the Watertower online content.
031250926X|5.0|The sliders can be finicky at times, but I guess it's to be expected with a board book. My son LOVES this book. We got it at the recommendation of a friend. It goes well with the polar bear what do you hear book as a baby or shower gift.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|What you usually get free on most PCs and laptops, you have to pay for when used in tablets. Those of you hooked on this card game consider it a must.
B0002DB52M|5.0|The Dogville´s story is narrated in nine chapters and takes place on a stage with minimalist scenery. Some walls and furniture are placed on the stage, but the rest of the scenery exists merely as white painted outlines which have big labels on them.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|If you travel, there is no reason to bring along an alarm clock or call the front desk to wake you up. The app for your tablet will wake you up to your favorite music or a variety of sounds. Perfect!
B000A88EV4|5.0|Thewlis' character in this movie is just amazing. Not sure if Leigh is trying to speak for a generation with this one (GenX in Britain) or what, but the characters in this movie are great! Hilarious dialogue with food for thought added right in.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Addictive game, but I need not tell anyone that. My only complaint is that I finished the game way too fast. I have bought every version of angry birds and this and the Star Wars version are my favorites.
0425264351|5.0|Great book...Lee Child really knows how to tell a story!  Can't wait to read the next one...will get it for my new Kindle reader.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you are a member of Facebook, you need this app. Works differently than the PG or laptop versions of Facebook and it takes some time to get use to, but it does its job.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|very interesting story with many plot twists. I cried when Matthew died. How sad to die at his happiest moment. Cant wait for the next episodes to air.
B00973902K|4.0|...but found an OK tune with a hummable chorus line. I can see why people love this tune, but there are really better songs out there by even lesser-known artists.
B009B4ZEMA|5.0|Favorite tracks: Best of Me, Circles and Just a Fool.<br /><br />Christina is back, and she definitely is bringing with her all the lessons learned in the past. Creativity from Bionic, check. Classiness from Back to Basics, check. Naughtiness and rawness from Stripped, check. Pop freshness from her debut, check. In a summary, she grew up and gave us a masterpiece.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you like Solitaire, you know this game is free, so why do we have to download it for the tablet? If you like Solitaire, your only choice is to do just that.
B0013J1WKY|5.0|One of her best concerts and definitely one that inspired the future generations, including her peers.<br /><br />This tour is FUN from beginning to the end. Definitely the kind of music dvd that you can play at gatherings or to accompany a nice meal.
B0063M22QO|5.0|If you are a Mahjong junkie, this game app is the place to start. Hours and hours of Mahjong fun are yours to be had.
B002361MLA|4.0|An easy read. This was recommended by a health professional and I do believe there are many truths to the statements in this book. Now to put them to work to become a better person and live life as a being....without fear, anger and the like. Enjoy the journey through its pages.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Perfect game app for those who wonder what all the fuss is about, but I guarantee after five to ten minutes of game play, you'll be buying the ad-free version.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is television at its best. The actors are superb! The sceenplay is wonderful. Television does not get any better than this!!! To miss DOWNTON ABBEY is to miss the very best work in the history of television!!!!!
B004LWZW6U|3.0|........but it's just a pimple on the ass of the first 2010 film. I expected more from director John Gulagher (son of actor Clu Gulagher and director of FEAST - 2005), but I guess you can't have everything. This was supposed to be a theatrical release, but when studio executives got a look at it, it went straight to DVD.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So far, mid season, it is as good as the past seasons!  Keep it up!  I love this show and will stick with it as long as it is on the air!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The camera on the Kindle Fire HD is nothing to write home about, so this app does the best it can with what little it has to work with.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I like the story and would read this author again.  This author is the best. Her stories are really good.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Definitely a game that uses your brainpower and the laws of physics. If you can't handle either, then you have picked the wrong game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I simply love this series! A wonderful period piece with everything from love & romance to murder & mystery... really a great series!
B007N85POS|3.0|Not as good as the original Angry Birds or the Star Wars version, but still fun to play and heads and shoulders above Angry Birds In Space.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is hilarious I would suggest watching the unrated version, NOT FOR KIDS!! Has some suggestive parts that made me blush!
B007MNV5WU|2.0|The worst game app of the series. It's the same as the Star Wars version, only with the regular cast of characters. This is the only version of Angry Birds that I didn't want to finish. Gameplay is the same as all the other versions, but something is missing. I wish I could put my finger on it!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|i highly suggest everyone watch this movie especially if you are considering a career in the medical field. It is suprising!
B008I43DYU|5.0|You never know when you are going to need a calculator or converter, so this app is a must-have for your tablet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great little game. Would be awesome for the young horse lover. Also gives one the idea of the work involved in the care of a horse.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game app and the original Angry Birds are my favorite games of the series. It doesn't take a genius to play this game, but it takes a lot of brainpower if you want to achieve three stars for every level. You know you are getting quality when George Lucas is involved.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|As a new viewer of The Mentalist, I wanted to know the backstory of this fascinating character.  Within minutes, I was watching the pilot episode.  Yea!
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I can't stop listening to the first CD! The other 2 are ok but the 1st CD is magic to me.  I have been waiting for an artist like this in R&B for such a long time... finally something different that is amazing.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Its a fun game. Addictive and Simple.<br />I find it challenging but not cheap. Ive been running from monsters for hours.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Having watched the series on HBO,I thought I would read the book and be far more impressed with the reading of it. They are almost identical!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Seemed like some parts seemed to drag on a bit.. Other parts were downright bizarre... I know its a story about zombies but the part where Rick was talking on the phone to his dead wife... lost me on that one honestly...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have this game fir SOMTHING else I wonder if it is as good as it us on my Wii  well we will see I having plastering yet!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|No idea how I stumbled on this author but very glad I did.  Been reading SciFi for 50 years and this is easily one of the top 10 Author/Universes.  If you love a dramatic and thoughtful universe with a bit of Mad Max/Apocalypse tossed in for good measure, you'll really like this author/series.  Destined to be a classic.  On my way to by the rest of the series now.  Matt
1932907009|5.0|THIS WAS A PRESENT  AND WAS JOYFULLY RECEIVED.  I HAVE HAD NO COMPLAINTS , SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN USEFUL TO MY COLLEGE STUDENT GRANDDAUGHTER.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Loved this book.  The first 150 pages were slow going, but worth the trip.<br />I saw the wonderful movie, but the book exceeds that movie.  I always read the book before I see the movie, when I can.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Good books, but I occasionally felt frustrated because Katniss was such a smart and courageous girl, yet she didn't really question the society she lived in. She didn't rebel against it or even voice opinions about the morality of what she was forced to do. She just seemed to play along as best she could. I think it would be a better book if she showed a little more independent thought, some opinions, some deeper emotional angst, and some searching for answers. I've read a lot of coming of age novels. A good book about a young woman who is smart, sensitive, and searching while living in a crazy time in the future is The Earth Girl and Queen Eliza, by C. C. Alma. [[ASIN:B00AC5MLZ0 The Earth Girl and Queen Eliza]]  I also love The Secret History, by Donna Tartt, [[ASIN:B005PRJT9Q The Secret History]]  a beautifully written long novel about college students in the 1980's. Overall, though, I would recommend these books.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is so good! I recommend it to all my friends. It is a little 'magical' but the writing is fantastic and you really get lost in the Circus world.
1616550414|5.0|Before receiving my book (which I've had on pre-order since it became available on the website), I was a bit bored. I arrived home, opened my door, and was blinded by a golden heavenly light. There the book stood surrounded in it's perfection. I grabbed the book with both my hands, held it high over my head, and a sudden musical performance surrounded the book and I (Du-Du-Du-Duhhhhh).<br />I opened the book only to view the epicness of what we know as the Legend of Zelda series. Every little detail, concept art, ideas, maps....I was wowed by this amazingness.<br /><br />In all seriousness though, this book is for the Zelda fan. Anyone who considers themselves a fan should buy this book. I'm having troubles putting it down because it's so epic. Go buy it! Buy it Nowwwww (<--Arnold Schwajhasdkjh7apsgers voice).
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Took me awhile to figure where I had read about the second guy and then I waited to see which of the good guys was going to die. I liked the vagueness of the ending as it pertained to the key players.
0345404475|5.0|This is Science Fiction at its best. Blade Runner is a great movie but this book needs to be read if you liked the movie. A cationary tale of the future that every person interested in the future needs to read.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Didn't enjoy this movie.  I wish it could of had a better ending.  Bruce dies come on.  Worst movie ever
B003OAL58E|2.0|Not that I don't like the Bergmanesque pace of the film:  That's the best part IMO, though simple to pull off.  No, I dislike the ignorant, preening contempt for pre-WWI Germans by coddled, soft, well-to-do, know-nothing moderns.  BTW, I think what most bothers \\"progressive\\" Germans and their offshoots about the two wars is not that their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents \\"started\\" them, but that they LOST them.<br /><br />But nevermind.  As Churchill said, the Hun is either at your throat or at your feet.  I think you can guess where the luvvies who created this effort are situated.  Could that change?  No, because the Germans don't reproduce anymore.  Thank God.<br /><br />All right.  What ARE the roots of National Socialism?  Same as International Socialism:  Rousseau.  Read him, if you actually, you know, read books.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good read for the weekend story. The happy ending you wanted and a story that will surprise you even more.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|This is a calm childrenl's show.  It is very clever and this is rare, I think it is better then the book.  My kids love it and want to watch it over and over again.  I never get tired of it.
B0015DRPJU|4.0|I loved this book like I did the first two books but the ending was unexpected and it just turned me off from going on to the other books in this series. I think the book just went to dramatic with the ending this early in the series.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Cost was great..packageing was great, delivery was, don't remember.  I have a problem with the way the companies are packing the movies, I want a Blu-Ray, not a dvd, why do I have to pay for both, I would buy a whole lot more Blu's if I could get just the blu instead a package deal that I don't want or need.. Sincerely
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I just bought a new 3D tv and wanted to try AVATAR in 3D but it's good overall, but not many 3D scenes that you can really tell the difference.

B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I love Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis and maybe their acting is great in this film; but the excessive cursing turned me off from movie. I am so sorry I wasted $4.99 via on demand ..... I could not watch the entire film.  I'm sadden that Mark and Mila would participate in all the cursing .... it really was not necessary.  And I'm not a holy roller ... just saying.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book first caught my attention while going through some of the quotes listed on GoodReads. Several made me laugh, and the book soon joined my to-read-pile. And now that I finished reading it, I can't wait to continue on in the series! This was a wonderful debut novel, and an intriguing (though very complete) start to the Mortal Instruments series. It was a very fast-paced and fun read, livened up by the near-constant bantering between the likable characters. And while the plot's big twist wasn't a complete shock, it certainly created a lot of curiosity about just where the remainder of the series will go!<br /><br />Clare created an interesting fantasy world - peopled with almost every imaginable supernatural being from vampires, werewolves, fairies, demons, warlocks and more. The characters weren't quite as fully developed (there really wasn't much there beyond that witty dialogue), but since there are at least four more books to the series, I am sure there will be plenty of opportunity for them to develop more!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|it acts up and don't run .. I paid for it too and it makes even my phone act up ugh
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Prometheus is a horror film that takes place in a science fiction setting.  The only problem is that it does neither of these things very well.  The setting and themes certainly look sci-fi, but nothing is fleshed out and the audience is left with shallow characters and vague plot concepts that leave more questions than answers.  The horror concept is ruined by a long and drawn out cycle of characters going from their ship, to the underground cave, back to their ship, back to the alien cave.  Throughout this, pointless conversations take place and some characters make very stupid decisions quickly leading to their demise.  The entire bit is sprinkled with alien-like creatures (ala face huggers from the original aliens series) and predators that look like large humans wearing predator masks.  It feels like an array of random scenes stitched together that lack cohesion of any kind and tell a very unsatisfying story of, \\"a bunch of people land on a planet and get killed by predator and alien like creatures, but not in any particular new or interesting way.\\"<br /><br />All in all, this is a movie you watch to burn time for the sake of burning time and ONLY if you feel like seeing the same old recycled characters and cliches.  Do you really feel the need to see the guy who approaches the slimy face eating snake like he's getting ready to pet a puppy, only to have his arm torn off and face eaten?  This is the movie for you.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved the movie.  I especially like the hulk as a hero (just like in the commic books).<br /><br />Bring on Avenger 2 on!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a game that I enjoy playing with my nephews we have a competition going on. As my 13 year old is kicking my my 43 year old tail with my 7 year old is right behind my score. Very fun!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how they brig ebb you to rate their game... I'm not complaining I'm enjoying the gems. This game is so cool.graphics are awesome. I love horses and some games are just dumb but this one is great tank you for making a great hose game... yay
B008IYR2BA|4.0|Before I get into this season specifically, full disclosure: Season 5 is my favorite season to date. Given that, season 6 had some pretty big shoes to follow!<br /><br />Overall the season was interesting and engaging with some pretty good character development on the part of Dexter and Debra.<br /><br />The overall plot arc for the season was solid as well, but I will say that this season isn't getting 5 stars from me because I really disliked the actor who plays the season's serial killer (not Edward James Olmos, he was great). I haven't had a chance to look up who he is but I really didn't care for him at all.<br /><br />In the end, the finale will leave you clamoring to see the season 7 premier! A must-watch season for any fan of Dexter.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|This book was an amazing read! I would recommend it to people who like adventurous romances. I would love to see this made into a movie... if the people make it like the book instead of making up their own stuff... ha-ha<br /> I almost cried at the end but everyone did their part in the final chapters... you will have to read to see of everyone makes it through. Read about the wolves of mercy falls!

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good entertainment. A lot of fun and good for people of all ages. Would recommend to anyone. A little confusing at first.
1849386684|5.0|I found Justin's courses on-line (youtube) after reading a WSJ article. This is great for self study. Songs are basic to get you started and you can get on Youtube to hear Justin play and give tips. I would highly recommend it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I don't have words for this book review.  Less than 10 minutes ago I was crying at what was going on in the book, now I'm stunned.  This book was amazing.  Alex, widow and father of two, was the most thoughtful and romantic guy ever. They just don't exist in real life!  Katie, an abuse survivor is guarded but slowly sees the good and learns to trust Alex through her friend Jo's guidance.  Kevin, Katies husband, is flat out crazy, but for some reason you feel bad for him as well.  The plot develops as Katie runs away to a small town to escape Kevin, when she meets jo, her neighbor not much older than her. With Jo's help and friendship, Katie lets her guard down for the local store owner Alex and his two children.  After time together, Alex begins to move on from his grief and realized he loves Katie even through her past.  Eventually events turn, but you have to read the book to find out....!!
B00935KWWO|4.0|While this, in my opinion, is the best Twitter App available, their new, obnoxious, random full and half screen ads that pop up when you're tweeting has made me not want to use it. It does have lots of great customization features, but it already has banner ads along the bottom, so the new pop-up ads are excessive, not needed and really annoying. Otherwise, this is a five-star App.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This could be a great, fun game but every other time I use the \\"save me\\" function it crashes and all coins and associated gems are gone.  Very frustrating.<br /><br />Updated-They seemed to have fixed the problem but I'll never get my lost coins and gems back so they get four stars.  My kids do love it.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It think it is a fun and creative game takes alot of skill to master it though can be addictive playing it .
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I can't get enough of the newest album from super sexy Canadian twins, Tegan & Sara Quin.<br />This album is definitely more poppy and produced than previous ones, but it works well and sounds like they're growing up a bit. Well done ladies, I love it!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I enjoyed the book, maybe not quite the same as later books but still very good and well worth it
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This was my first real automatic/mechanical watch, let alone a Seiko, and I can guarantee it will not be my last Seiko watch. For the very modest price, you get a lot for the money you pay. I have not lost more than a minute in the three weeks I have worn the watch, which is very impressive given that this is a lower-end model. In addition, it is very aesthetically pleasing, and the pictures on Amazon do not do the watch justice (seriously, take a look at some better, clearer pictures on Google images to see what I mean). At first, I really wasn't too thrilled about the nylon strap and thought about replacing it with something leather, but to be honest, I have kind of grown to like it.<br /><br />I only ask this of Seiko: PLEASE make this watch water resistant!!!<br /><br />So, to break it down with pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- very reasonably priced<br />- very accurate<br />- aesthetically gorgeous for a lower-end military-style watch<br /><br />Cons:<br />- strap is very sporty (may or may not be a con, and it is still a good and sturdy strap)<br />- rotor is a little noisy/grindy<br />- not water resistant - despite that the watch says it is water resistant, I would not get this watch near water EVER and have heard similar comments. It is not rated for water at all.<br /><br />For the price of this watch, you really can't go wrong and is a great starter watch for any beginner.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was another great Nicholas Sparks book, and I can't wait to see the movie.  It was touching, suspenseful, funny, and an all around great read.  I highly recommend it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best show EVER!!! So good I bought it again when DISH network jerked us around on our channel line up.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I am enjoying the game. it is fun as a small time occupier.  I would recommend it to any fantasy geek
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I chose this rating because I enjoyed all three of the trilogy books. Also kindle books were an easy fast download.
B00275EGX8|5.0|I am a movie person, absolutely. If you have not seen the Hurt Locker, you need to. It is an absolutely fantastic piece, and there is nothing quite like it. Blu-Ray quality is the best way to go, and I can only give this product the best!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I chose this rating because I enjoyed all three of the trilogy books. Also kindle books were an easy fast download.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|No doubt this movie has some deep flaws. The one that sticks out is the total lack of explanation for any of David's (the android) actions. However this and other plot issues can still be fixed in a sequel.This is a beautifully shot and acted movie. The theme is incredibly ambitious. It's wonderful to see one of my favorite properties filling the void that exists in the &#34;epic Sci-Fi &#34; genre.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Couldn't stop playing this if I tried.  Spent the weekend perfecting each restaurant! The whole family loves this game!  Give us more please!
B00992CF6W|4.0|best game ever. bud its hard to find gold I found 4 vanes of 8 dimands but no gold and it needs to update as soon as the update comes out for all the other app stores
B002ZG975Q|5.0|I really liked this modern take on the story. It's a great story and if you pay attention quite a bit nicer to the boy than the Disney version. It's not spectacular, but I enjoyed it and for what it is, it is a good movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love it...very addicting & fun but sometimes freezes on my kindle fire. Overall it is a great game my nephews get sucked into it for hours and I do as well cute characters and world tour different missions and highly reccommended
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|This movie is very far from a classic but seeing RC and Lucy L cavorting around in a kung fu flick is a trip.  I don't think it will go down in history as either one's best and I probably should not have given it a 5 but I really got a kick out of this movie--like a cartoon but violent, you know?  I admit it--I have a crush on Crowe and I think Lucy was the coolest angel.  So shoot me.  Or jack knife me?
B007WKEM8C|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading this cookbook.  I've noted many recipes that I will try and have made just one so far.

B000FC1RCI|4.0|Good mystery, love the ending. It is a great mystery plot line and i recommend to everyone. Agatha Christie does a great job.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Great movie, definitely a must see. One of the few classics left, and in great quality now! A must see if you have a love for the classics.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a great series!  Drama, romance, and history all wrapped up in one!  So happy to have learned about it and it is truly a masterpiece.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Quick & Dirty: Anyone that is a YA Dystopian fan will really enjoy the fast paced sequel that Lauren Oliver has delivered. There is romance, action, and heartbreaking moments throughout the whole book, making it a hard read to put down.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: Alex and I are lying together on a blanket in the backyard of 37 Brooks.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />Pandemonium is set in a futuristic United States where love is a horrible disease called the deliria. Everyone is forced by the government to get a procedure done that cures the deliria when they turn 18. Not everyone agrees with the government. The Invalids live outside of the cities and they are against the procedure being done. They believe that people should have a choice on whether or not to get the procedure. Most of them have joined the resistance to try and stop the government. There is also a very radical group called the DFA (Deliria-Free America). They believe that the procedure should be done at a younger age to try and stop deliria outbreaks. They also believe that everyone should have the procedure done even if it will kill you.<br /><br />The book is told in two different parts -- the present and the past. It starts in the present and Lena is at school in New York City, where she has joined the resistance. She is ordered to join the DFA and keep an eye on Julian Fineman. He is the son of the leader of the DFA. Lena goes to a DFA rally and is kidnapped by scavengers and is held hostage with Julian. While being held captive Julian and Lena get to know each other and they find out they aren't as different as they originally thought.<br /><br />In the past we follow Lena after she escapes from Portland into the wild. She has no friends, no family, no food and nowhere to go. She left Portland because she did the unthinkable -- she fell in love. They decided that the only way to be together was to leave, but while running away they were separated. She has no idea if he is alive or not but she has to move on and try to survive. She is rescued by an Invalid group and taken to their home base outside of Rochester New Hampshire. We follow the lives of the Invalids and see how Lena adjusts to becoming one.<br /><br />Lena grows so much through this book. She becomes this amazing character that is strong, confident and can totally kick butt when she needs to. I love that even though she has been really hurt by love in the past she is still willing to be open to idea of new love entering her life. She has developed into this wonderful strong women and she is willing to fight for a cause that she believes in.<br /><br />Julian is a new character that we are introduced to in Pandemonium. He is determined to get the cure even though it may kill him, but before he gets the procedure done he is kidnapped and meets Lena. He learns that there the Invalids aren't what he thought and he starts to second guess all the things he was raised to believe in. Of course Lena and Julian start to develop feelings for each other. Their romance develops slowing and it is really sweet.<br /><br />Raven is also a new character introduced in Pandemonium. She is the leader of the invalids at the base Lena goes to in New Hampshire. Ravens story is really heartbreaking, she has lived in the wild for 6 years now and no one really knows why she left home. Being the leader of the Invalids, she feels responsible for all of the people that live there and it is a hard life with lots of loss. She becomes good friends with Lena throughout the book and tries to teach Lena what life is like being an Invalid.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Pandemonium. At times the going back and forth between the past and present was a little confusing but it all comes together nicely in the end. There is romance, heartbreak, action and a killer cliffhanger ending. I loved the character development in this book and it is beautifully written. If you enjoyed book one in the Delirium series, you will not be disappointed with book 2. It defiantly delivers.

B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the book 1, you must read book two! It is thrilling, excelent, well written. I really loved it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game you can build anything you want and it just got a new upgrade so it now has armor and other stuff.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I though the book was excelent, exciting and not for teens only! The movie is terrible in comparison with the book. Great buy!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a great game. It has way better graphics then the first and better maps and its just an overall better game.
B000YXMMAO|5.0|This was the first vinyl I've ever purchased and with good reason - I could go on about the awesome sound tones and all that but if you've heard the album before and love it, just get it. The artwork is also more than enough reason to purchase it, seeing it in a large format is awesome.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|It's a good game. I would love to play more! It needs to have more levels or another game. Please make another game it's to short and I would love to play more.
B004EPZ034|5.0|if you have ever been on a carnival cruise, it will totally take you back. Loved it, another great kids animated movie
B00782O7IY|5.0|A great story, two picture-perfect actors. Even if it didn't have the dog, this is a film so spot-on that it will still be a fresh joy on its sixth viewing.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|great kids movie, so funny<br />it shipped fast and free<br />i am very happy with my purchase<br />buy the smurfs

B00B780TAK|5.0|After becoming so attached to these characters to the point they transcended the screen, I was angry Matthew is in the car accident at the end of this episode.  The writer better make it just be an accident and not a death.  If he dies...this is so unfair....to the viewers and the characters.<br /><br />As for the show, it is absolutely amazing...
B0086700CM|4.0|I got this game for my grandson and he loves playing it.Wasn't sure I would use the game apps on my Kindle but grandson age 6 does.
030758836X|3.0|I started this book with high hopes because it is a bestseller.  It was agonizingly slow going for the first half, and I wish one of the two narrators would just be forthcoming with what had really happened. Then I am doggedly determined to finish, so I could discover WHY this was a bestseller.  I finished the book feeling oddly cheated. I could think of some much better endings. Can't really go into what they are, as it would spoil the so-called plot.<br />It is probably well written.  But I could not like any of the characters at all. So smarmy, soul-less, and depressing to the core.<br />Read it if you must, then you will see what I mean.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book throws you for a loop which totally makes this book a excellent read. sweet love story. book is based on high school drama
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's awesome who cares what other people say 5 star I like it a lot  make more  # 3 awesome
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This retelling of the Sherlock Holmes story has it all.  Good story telling, good character development, and a good mystery (which is hard to come by).  This make Elementary look like a really bad episode of \\"Law & Order: Most Obvious Answer That Can Be Found in 30 Minutes or Less\\".
0765325950|5.0|I'm mainly writing this review in response to all the ebook protests.  It was a publishing decision to hold the release of the ebook - that has no bearing whatsoever on the quality of this book.<br /><br />This is a great end to the Wheel of Time series.  Team Jordan did a great job wrapping up loose ends, and many of the mysteries that remain are things that Robert Jordan himself specified that he wanted left unexplained.  I have no complaints, except that the series is over!

B00B7FXYJG|2.0|I watched part one last night, and part two tonight. Part two, in my estimation, was not nearly as good as part one. Even though I used to own Miller's original graphic novel, I do not recall President Reagan being made fun of. I think making fun of him in this movie, in such a callous way, demeans DC and shows them to be liberal in their dealings with the true heroes of the Cold War. So, DC and WB, you now have lost a true fan. I hope you're happy.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I'v now seen it about 7 times and still adore Tom Wilkinson, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith.<br />The cinamatography is superb, and the acting great. It has pathos and great laughter.

I now live a very happy and non stressful life...It is my way of life....Anita Moorjani book Dying to be me only enforces Dr Dyer's teachings..I go back and re read passages often...I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to  get in touch with your own magnificence  and live life fearlessly..

B009E3EXMU|4.0|Very Nice. The concert was exciting. Members of the band have not lost much in 45 years. Very impressive and worth the purchase. Jason Bonhams Father [John] would be proud. Dazed and confused was played a little daze and confused but all in all a worthy purchase.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think the Hunger Games is one of the interesting books ever, so different to other books with vampires and werewolfs.<br />I can relate to Katniss Everdeen, i feel like I know what she is going through. I love this book because it is so differant and it's a completely differant world to now and I think to myself could this happen. That 12 to 18 year olds fight to the death, just for entertainment!!! I will recommend this book to everyone in the world. So read it!!!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The stand is very easy to use, price was right, easy to remove and put back on, the elastic closure is perfect, and of course the color.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss is the best fantasy writer of this decade. The Kingkiller series is classic epic fantasy at its best, in the tradition of Tolkien, Eddings, Brooks, Martin, Pratchett, and the other great authors of this genre. Read this author, you will not be disappointed.
B009LA1QW6|2.0|I liked her previous album quite a bit, but this one was way too sleepy and monotone throughout.  I get the torchy slow song thing occasionally, but this album just drags.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Easy to get hooked on this complete waste of time....but it is one of two of the most enjoyable games I play.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to open and play.  Provides an undo key which is very important.  This app is good for passing the time.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I liked the intertwining of the 3 stories into one. The reader is given small clues to each life in all the stories. Sometimes a bit hard to keep track of the generations. I wrote down a family tree and referred to it often and that helped. Interesting book.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I downloaded this as a free app. It's easy to set up and operate.  The app works  well in my shop,too.

B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I think that, like other people said, it is awesome but too short. I was about to finish my underwater home, when I ran out of time......
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|takes a bit to get put together but once you figure it out, you got it. easy to use, and cuts well. I scored the bottle, then did boiling/ice water back and forth until the bottom fell off. Be sure to cut up a little from the bottom. The glass is very thick at the bottom and it will not break clean. Ive done 5 or 6 bottles, and only messed up one.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I rate movies by how many times I would watch it, I would watch this again, tries the previous Men in Black movies together.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Treasure island is a good classic book that gave me hours of reading enjoyment. All the pirate language made it hard to read sometimes but gave it realism that made it enjoyable.
B004OA6KIS|5.0|I enjoy revisiting this book because it gives insight into the genius that was Feynman. It would be difficult to  classify  this book since it could be considered philosophy, history,autobiographical  or even self help.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|Awesome music! The more you listen this album, the better it gets! Jack White is truly a talented young musician!
1451638450|5.0|\\"I think I was six before I realized that \\"That Idiot\\" was not Ivan's first name\\" - Miles Vorkosigan<br />This is a story in which the main character is the fellow that has, before this, played the comic-relief sidekick in all of his previous appearances.<br />I've been following the Vorkosigan Saga for a long time, since reading \\"The Weatherman\\" in Analog Magazine in 1990. We've seen Ivan grow from a squalling babe, born into the howling chaos of a Civil War, growing to manhood as the son of a widow, playing the buffoon so as not to become a focus of political strife - and finally, he is free of that.<br />The Succession is assured, his Cousin Miles is no longer in the Service...the only flaw is that Ivan is, for the first time in his life, lonely. He's finally ready to find a nice girl and settle down, but there's a shortage of suitable women.<br />And so, like any Bujold Hero, his dilemma is solved for him - by having a crazy situation dumped in his lap.<br /> A simple favor for his cousin Byerly turns into a kidnapping, along with an investigation into the theft of Government equipment, and -oh, the pretty girl he's helping is an illegal immigrant, as well as being chased by alien bounty hunters.<br />Like any Bujold Story, the situation is totally unpredictable - and do not bother to read the last page, as you will NEVER guess how Ivan got from page one to the last page.<br />In fact, I invite you to try that - read page one, then read the last page - and THEN read everything in between...in a good book, that INCREASES the anticipation - \\"how the heck did he -?\\"
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is easy to navigate.  It is user friendly.  I like it much better than some others I have used.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|A couple of slackers race through the city fighting off the undead to save a girlfriend. SIMON PEG is so perfect in this movie. He is so very funny. Always fun to rewatch. This movie is a keeper. I LOVE IT.<br />For those who really liked this movie, I will recommend DEAD ALIVE--one of Peter Jackson's first movies. It's a comedy/zombie movie (this one has MAJOR gore and blood, but is hilarious).
B000X2H8G4|1.0|Turn the earphone jack one way you get sound, turn the other you get static. Not useful for what I intended.
B0042816YK|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie.  My favorite line, Girl, you don't need a hero you need a champion.  Oh wow... love it love it.
0765325950|4.0|Considering all this series has endured to reach it's ending, I was not entirely disappointed. I still feel Mat wasn't anywhere close to how RJ himself would have written the character, but I respect that Brandon did what he could with someone else's creation. The battles were epic and plentiful and I found myself alternately cheering and gasping out loud as I read. The major characters get their time to shine, while others I would have preferred to see more of. The ending wasn't too surprising considering the amount of speculation that has been going on for years, but I felt satisfied with it. I recommend it to any wheel of time fan who wants to see how it all ends.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You better love this game<br /><br />Or I take you down temple run 2 ok<br /><br />Love who plays temple run 2 all the time

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was very well written. I couldn't put it down once I purchased it on my amazon kindle app. I found myself reading it on my smartphone at red lights while driving, or while I was stuck in traffic.<br /><br />The story line will make you cringe and you'll have so many mixed emotions throughout the book.<br /><br />Buy it, it's worth it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Excellent story. I highly recommend this book. A feel good story that had a lot of twists and turns. Beautifully written

B0083Z614S|5.0|This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up, so it was a natural choice as the first book to download to my daughters kindle.  If you have a young lady between 8-14yr old this book will be perfect reading.  You just can't go wrong with this choice.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Buy this book, read it and it'll turn you into a whole different person. Very sexual but intimate.  Couldn't wait to get started on the third book.

B0096DFBZQ|4.0|You can actually change the way you move the cart . There's a section I came upon when I paused the game I think it was settings but if you go there's a sound setting and an acceleration setting so turn the acceleration on so that you don't have to use the annoying arrows to control your vehicle. After that you just use your whole kindle like a steering wheel. Hope that helps anyone!

B009YP9L7U|3.0|Waking Up Married by Mira Lyn Kelly  is an entertaining read, the perfect quick read.  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas would have been perfect, had Megan not married Connor.  She finds herself talking to Ralf (vomiting) the next morning as Connor looks on. The events of the night before elude her and she feels the need to find a lawyer asap.  Connor has other ideas, he seems to think they could make a go at it.  Do you think Megan will agree or proceed with a divorce?  I look forward to reading the other KISS titles from Harlequin.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best season yet. Can't wait for it to return in February 2013. Well worth the price to buy the season.

B001AITH50|5.0|Just as good as it was about 20 years ago.  Old school vampires, they drink warm blood and lurk in the shadows. Not like the new generation of vampire movies.
B0035JNRYY|5.0|Great Performance and story. They don't write many great material<br />for movie screens anymore. It takes the right chemistry to make it happen<br />on screen.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|Pitch Perfect movie arrived in very good condition and was a very good movie to watch.  Kids enjoyed it alot.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|One could say that Mission Impossible is America's version of James Bond, except that our hero is married and faithful to his wife; maybe a credit to star actor Tom Cruise's membership in Scientology.  Given that statement, last year saw both a James Bond and a Mission Impossible film released.  Plot lines from both movies shared some traits; i.e. the death of a key supporting figure, two sexy female action stars, and of course the standard betrayals and gadgets.  All of this leads one to consider that maybe the screenwriters of both films hang out together.  Irregardless, this was a good movie, and probably the best MI film yet.  The lead actor is the same as before, but the rest of the IMF crew is new, with Paula Patton essentially having a breakout role in this film, showing of her looks, action skills, and some decent acting in the process.  Jeremy Renner is also featured, making this the third action franchise he is starring in, following his roles in the Bourne films and Marvel films.  The special effects are great, with awesome settings, in this case on the outer walls of an Arabian skyscraper.  Overall, one of 2012's better action films.
1451696191|5.0|First saw the movie and I HAD to buy the book! VERY good book & VERY good story! I am in LOVEEE with it. Contains some innapropriate behaviors and language. 17 +

B009SQRL4U|5.0|This is a charming film and has the Aardman marks all over it -- sweet, quirky and fun. The reindeer with a &#34;cone of shame&#34; was delightful. My seven-year-old loved it and we've watched this film multiple times.
B007SGM084|5.0|This set sucked me in and I really hope she will write more of the Fifty shades books. I love C. Gray and Anastasia. Great books. I want more. I was sad to finish. Now I will wait for her next book. My new favorite author. It is a must read trilogy.

B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of acting and character development that has already occurred in the first two episodes of this new show. I'm a huge fan, and looking forward to seeing how this season continues on. Not the typical kind of show from Fox, it's a refreshing change from their standard lineup.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A very good end to the series.  No questions are left unanswered.  The future of everyone is know.<br /><br />Although the events that take place aren't pleasant, the author manages to capture hope and the good in people.
0545425115|3.0|Finally ordered as the books and movies have been talked about alot but I have not had time to read it yet.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|I kept looking for something to pull them all together.  It took about  four stories to see the theme.  Each story drew me in<br /><br />Thankful for terrible weather so I could inhale this book with no guilt of holding the couch down.

1481251880|4.0|***Trigger alert - this book can trigger PTSD incidents for victims of sexual abuse or violence. (I will describe more later in this review.)***<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: In the interest of helping people who have trigger problems, I'm going to explain a very small bit of the plot. However, there are no spoilers until the section below labeled \\"triggers.\\" Even in that section, I haven't given names or specific information. If you think you may need to know more about what's in the book, read that section. If it doesn't apply to you, read everything up to that point and then buy the book.<br /><br />I normally don't trust the raving, five-star reviews of books, because enjoyment of literature is very subjective. I decided to give this book a shot, because I was looking for a romance (yes, with some erotic scenes) that was of a higher caliber than the Harlequin books at the grocery store. I'm well aware that this is far, far, FAR from truly great literature. I am not evaluating it in the same class, or on the same scale, or with the same standards as I do \\"To the Lighthouse\\" or \\"The Sound and the Fury.\\" I was an English major in college and adore truly superb works of literary art. This book? It's not that. Not even close. On the other hand, it isn't intended to be. It's a short novel about the romance between two teenagers. What elevates it is their mature emotional development, the genuine nature of their love, and the very, very serious issues they have to deal with. As a way to pass the time, and a break from the wordy historical romances I've been reading, it was refreshing. It was also touching and insightful - something missing from many other books in this genre. For that, I've given it four stars.<br /><br />So. Hopeless. I'll try to break this down into a few different aspects of the book, so that it isn't just a long ramble.<br /><br />First, the problems: Their age was the only troublesome aspect, for me. I'm a 26 year old married mother, and it was odd for me to be imagining two teenagers having sex. However, they were both more mature than their age. Plus, I was sexually active at that age, too, so it's a smidge hypocritical of me to feel uncomfortable with it. Nevertheless, I would have preferred it if they were college-aged rather than still in high school. That issue and the editing errors ('deduced to tears' was one of the most glaring ones) are the only reasons I'm giving it four stars rather than five.<br /><br />Writing: This book is truly well written. There were a few minor typographical errors in my kindle copy, but the story was enough to eclipse that for me.<br /><br />I felt the author did a great job using foreshadowing, and the occasional vignette into the future or the past helped move the story along. It was great that she started with a scene several months ahead of the begining of the story, because otherwise the first few chapters might have been boring (but necessary for character develooment). Since we knew there was some serious angst and drama coming up, we as readers got to go through the story looking for hints at why or when.<br /><br />Characters: I think both Sky and Holder were well developed as characters. I didn't have a very specific idea of what either of them looked like, which I liked - it allows me to fill in my own details and imagine them in my own way.<br /><br />Sky was simultaneously immature and beyond her age, which is a trait you see in many young adults caught between childhood and independence. By the end of the novel, even given as much as she's been through, she's still Sky. In some romance novels, the characters completely reform or change for the relationship. I'm always bothered when that happens, so I'm pleasantly surprised when a character maintains their own identity while still developing and growing throughout the book.<br /><br />Holder...yikes! He's sort of the perfect guy. Caring, loving, passionate, protective, a but mysterious and dark, sexy as hell...while he didn't do so much growing throughout the book, I think the focus was on Sky. His role was essentially to foster her rebirth. As such, he was perfect. He says all the right things, reacts the right way, and honestly has Sky's best interests at heart.<br /><br />Relationship: The relationship between Sky and Holder was genuinely compelling. I think they were a bit young to really feel or know \\"true love,\\" but if they'd been any older the story would have lost the coming-of-age aspect that made it so poignant. Their interactions are natural, and reminded me a bit (okay, a lot) of when my husband and I first met. While some of the dialogue is a bit over the top, it still fit with the characters and their feelings for each other. And, if that seems totally unrealistic to you, maybe you haven't been so intensely in love. My husband and I said (and meant) some pretty amazingly sappy things to each other in the early days :-)<br /><br />Sex: This book is s.l.o.w. about sex. That's not to say it isn't there, or that they don't have a sexual relationship. There is certainly a graphic scene or two, but not gratuitously so, and certainly more artfully described than many, MANY romance novels. It's erotic, but not erotica. The first love scene between them, they don't even have sex. Even so, it's amazingly, surprisingly hot. I read it several times over before going to the next chapter, because it was that delicious. The third time is the most romantic, loving sex scene I think I've ever read. They make love...and by that I mean they actually make love together. It's also tasteful but still arousing. The other sex scenes are something I'll deal with below.<br /><br />Triggers: Without divulging too much, a character of this book was a victim of sexual abuse as a child. There are flashback vignettes that describe the abuse. Additionally, this character struggles with sex as an adult. There are two scenes that could be disturbing, not from the physical actions described butbecause of the emotional state the character is in. On a more personal note, I went through something very similar to the abuse described in the book - though not at the hands of someone I trusted as much as this character does. I can say that it was gently dealt with, and that their emotions were very much what a real person can go through in that situation. I'd still encourage you to read the book, because ultimately it is an incredibly healing story. However, if you think that reading such scenes may trigger flashbacks, panic attacks, etc. please don't read this book.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This series is fantastic from start to finish ... both the soundtrack and the television set have captivated me for its originality, sensuality and even scenic art for violence and blood ... five stars!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a good game yo nowat i mean but not as good a  I thought it would be bettervthan wat i

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome read! Was done with this book in a day! Highly recommend this book--now a big fan of colleen Hoover
B009WHCYDI|3.0|The topic and acting were very realistic and well done.  The movie kept me engaged until the very end.  The ending was rediculously anti-climatic.  Not worth the money.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I LOVE this game.  It's great fun and good brain exercise, especially for spatial challenges.  I highly recommend it! Like I said, totally addicting!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|She is kind of annoying and Grey is overbearing. That pretty much sums it up. Thank you for your time.
B008OJ291W|1.0|The 'drumming' is truly awful. Bass guitar basically doesn't exist. Slight tempo and rythem changes ruin old favorites. Where is the layered, wall of sound piano in &#34;Don't bring me down&#34;? The remake of this one should go into the hall of fame of worst remakes ever. &#34;Livin thing&#34; would join it. jeff is allowed to hate the old record companies for taking most of his money, but this 'solution' is a crime to music lovers.
B004132HZS|5.0|I decided to make the plunge into the Sherlock Universe two years ago at my summer camp around the same time I was introduced to Doctor Who.  Doctor Who was really easy to find on BBCA, and I soon devoured it.  Sherlock on the other had... Not so easy to find, so it slipped to the back of my mind.  My interest was revived after a combination of another year at summer camp hearing how &#34;AMAZING&#34; it was coupled with my fellow Whovian's at marching band camp turning to Sherlock in conversation and I wasn't able to follow.  That was the final straw, I said what the heck and just bought the DVD on Amazon.  One of the best decisions ever.  I had a sleepover planned with my camp friends, one a Sherlockian, and one a fellow newbie.  We had one of the best television marathons of my life.  The morning after I bought the second dvd.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|This is a handy and versatile case. It is sturdy and attractive. I gave it as a gift and the recipient loved it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I really enjoy this game. It's funner than the first, and the graphics are great. HOWEVER, everytime I play it changes my live background. It also freezes and glitches from time to time, killing your  game. If those two things could be changed, it would be fantastic.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|It's fun finding radio stations from all over the world.  My father lives across the state, and sometimes sings solos in church, which is broadcast on the local radio station, so it's nice to be able to get that radio station on Tunein and hear him sing when we can't travel there ourselves.
0736092269|5.0|I love the book. Its a good way of learning the basics. Whats great about this book, is the detail on the muscles that work on each exercise.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I chose this book because reading a book by Sparks is familiar. It is comforting. The plot was somewhat predictable, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Taught responsibility to my kids for Christmas I am going to let them have a fish.<br /> The kids love it ; )  I can't wait to see them learn on a game
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this latest Batman movie. Lot of action and good special effects. I cannot wait to see the sequel. I recommend it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|After some research and taking into consideration reviews read and the price offered from Amazon I decided to purchase these headphones. I have been very impressed.<br />Sound is very clear and frequency response if good with almost no noise.<br />The surround sound is also very good with sounds appearing to emanate from all directions. I play a number of games and these are very useful in FPS.<br />The microphone is receptive and clear with no additional external noise. So I have been told by others to whom I chat.<br />All round one of the best value for money products I have found.<br />On top of this I ordered the week before Christmas and expected to receive the goods after Christmas and possibly New Year. They arrived on the 23rd of December to my great surprise.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I liked the movie, especially the special effects. It is different than the original movie. Overall, I enjoyed watching it. I recommend it.
0743270754|5.0|Anyone who enjoyed Spielberg's Lincoln movie will get a lot from historian Doris Kearns Goodwin's biographical treatise, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, published in 2005. This is the book Spielberg based his movie on and so readers will get rich details they probably missed in the movie.<br /><br />Goodwin's book centers on Lincoln's power of persuasion and skills in negotiating agreement among cabinet members Salmon Chase, Edward Bates and William Seward to bring about the abolition proclamation and eventual victory in the civil war.<br /><br />This jury of three would not have been selected by any attorney because of their conflicting political views but Lincoln worked with what he had and demonstrated his ability to not only reconcile a nation but reconcile these three stubborn, strong-willed egotists.<br /><br />In the end, the team of rivals became a single force to change history. I highly recommend this book.
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|It is not as good as the previous Resident Evil movies. The plot is so so. Still, it was entertaining.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|They upgraded the graphics and added some new gameplay. Great. Just as fun as the original. Must... stop... playing!<br /><br />=)
B004EPYZSU|4.0|This was an enjoyable movie, but I was expecially glad to get the blu-ray and dvd for a good price.  (I expect that's because Cowboys and Aliens wasn't widely popular, but I liked it.  The blend of western and sci-fi wasn't palatable for some.)
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|This is a replacement CD because he misplaced his last copy; and it is one of his favorites to listen to.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Legit fun, the graphics are fantastic and there is a lot to do. I sense the gems be becoming difficult to obtain in the near future
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome crap the best game ever because its free you get lots of game so cool I'll aprove this game and never doubt to not like it.
0060555661|5.0|Chapters 10-20 focus strictly on fundamental analysis, stock selection, convertible issues and warrants, and other subjects. Investors who plan to invest directly in stocks should make sure to read these chapters. However, for readers more interested in investing in mutual funds, and in particular index funds, they need not concern themselves with all the detail in these chapters unless they have the time or interest in the subject matter presented.<br />Graham lays out some important characteristics of \\"value\\" stocks. (p. 348). Some of the metrics are dated, but the principles are still valid. Even deep value investing today would seem like GARP investing to Ben Graham. Investors are now more focused on future earnings than they were in his day, and valuations reflect that.<br />In conclusion, the combination of pioneer Ben Graham's original work coupled with Zweig's meticulous and enjoyable update, make this a remarkable book about investments and investor behavior that every new and experienced investor should read. Of the 500 investing books that I've read, this one certainly is one of the greats of all time.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|the amazon mobile app slowed down my phone and messed it up pretty badly which is why i uninstalled it.
B00094ARZ0|5.0|Very sensual, sexy plot, filmed and directed very well, and of course you also get to gaze at the beauty of Bo Derek, what else do you need, good movie and story line, arrived in 3 days, and was well packed, I'm very happy with my purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids were really into this first, but I am totally addicted now. This RIO setting is absolutely gorgeous. The fast pace and new look of the game is.terrific.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for all ages.  Good for teaching young children to care for and be responsible for an animal.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|The Tenth Doctor will always be my favorite regeneration of that clever Time Lord. As such, I was very, VERY excited to get his screwdriver. However, it didn't quite live up to my expectations.<br /><br />First, the positives. It handles nicely, and while it takes a bit to get used to, it feels right in the palm of your hand. The two sounds it produces are classic and I found myself sonic-ing a lot of stuff. Excluding very pricey models you can find on other sites, this is definitely the most accurate version, especially since it extends nicely.<br /><br />Now, the negatives. The ink nibs fall off easily if you keep this in your pocket (and trust me, it'll be hard to NOT carry this around with you), and are VERY easily lost (I own two of these and have lost all the nibs). And the nibs have to be reordered from the company on a separate site and are pretty expensive. Secondly, while it produces two different sounds, they are VERY hard to tell apart at first listening. It's a shame, since all the others make at least four different sounds (excluding the Master's, but we only heard two from him anyways). After owning my first one for about two months, the top activator stud fell off and I am loath to try and fix it, out of fear of making it worse.<br /><br />All in all, it's not a bad screwdriver by any means. If you want Ten's screwdriver, this is the version to get. Just be aware that it has its flaws, and that if you are simply looking to buy any screwdriver, this would not be my first recommendation.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game!!!!  Best game we have purchased so far!!!  We would definetly recomend this game to everyone.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I get a total body work out from his DVD. I had it many years ago on VHS and re-purchased it for myself years later. I love how she and the trainer work your whole body without a lot of jumping and running around the house. I have been back on track with my work-outs because of this DVD and her earlier 1st version. I put on my own music every now and again, and when I go to the gym on off days, I use her techniques with weights there! really see a difference when you use this workout DVD!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've always enjoyed solitaire.  The fact that I can now take it with me anywhere... well that's just icing on the cake.  I love this game!

B007V65R54|5.0|This was a good treatment of the subject for the casual reader. It has many easy to understand and interesting examples to show statistical concepts.
B009O2XY12|5.0|This is fun and help to teach coordination and helps to retain it too.I like this game a lot and would advise trying it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Not the type of show I would normally watch but after seeing the ratings and hearing about it from several people decided to tive it a try. I am hooked.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft!! My friend git me into this and now I am addicted to this game. I play the Xbox edition and now I play this version (by the way I really want the pc version too!) But this version gets on my nerves a bit though... it takes forever for an update to come out and its really hard to control Steve. I would like more from this version but other then that it is a great game! You minecraft haters STINK!!! Try the game and you will love it!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game and so does my daughter.  So as not to fight over Beauty, we have to take turns taking care of her.  We really enjoy this game.
B007BVT5N4|4.0|I have never been a big fan of Justin but now I think I am!! He now has inspired me to do what I want to do!! I'm not good at it but I will do my best!
B005LAIH2C|4.0|I wasn't expecting anything deep or insightful or thought provoking when I went to see this. I was expecting a fantasy/horror movie with dark humor where I could turn off my brain and just enjoy the ride and that was pretty much what I got. I really enjoyed it. It was fun and funny and it was fairly obvious that their tongues were firmly in their cheeks when they made this. I enjoyed the 'Middle Ages meets Steampunk' aspect and thought it was a nice touch that Hansel actually developed the sugar sickness - a.k.a. diabetes - from being forced to eat all that candy as a kid.<br /><br />I enjoyed the brother/sister vibe between the two. You don't see a great many brother/sister action duos. At least, none come immediately to mind. It's always buddies/cops or soldiers and if there is a male/female pairing it's usually romantic. To have the protagonists be siblings was a refreshing twist. They both knew the other could take care of themselves but were still protective and concerned for each other.<br /><br />And as for taking care of themselves, hunting witches was never shown as easy. They each got their asses handed to them on numerous occasions throughout the film and in the scene where we see Hansel shirtless, his body is covered in scars, both old and new.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that it wasn't long enough. It's run time is just short of 90 minutes so they had ample room to expand a few scenes - or even add new ones - to flesh out the characters a little.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I am completely obsessed with this CD. If you like the show, you will love the CD. So glad they cut a CD for the tv show. A must hear!
B0045HCJ94|5.0|Charcter development, music, cinematography, dialogue and subject matter are just so far above and beyond anything we read or view today. If one loves good, dark and intense drama, both grim and hilarious this is it.
B00ABO573A|4.0|How many films have now been made on how addiction of any kind poisons an affair between two people deeply in love? In &#34;Keep the Lights On,&#34; the theme is given a good reanimation by the blond hero whose slow awakening to the fact that his partner's hopeless commitment to a drug takes precedent over their own relationship. The feelings remain, but the hero knows when it's time to get out and get back together with his own life. Harsh but wise.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Expendables 2 is more of the same from the first movie. Every action star from the 80's and 90's imaginable is in this movie. Also, every corny one liner is here too. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will like this one as well.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|A movie with lots of great characters and fun singing. Sure, it's a predictable plot, but I didn't mind at all considering it was so much fun. Nice to see a movie with so many great female characters, too. I especially loved Fat Amy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game . It is fun because you have your own pet and have  to take care of her or him.
B0086700CM|5.0|If you don't pay attention you can be playing this game for hours. The levels don't change all too much, and overall it's pretty hard. There should be easier level settings.
0199267170|5.0|I bought this gift as a Christmas present.  The receiptent was very happy with my gift choice.  Yeah - Me.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Good workouts, noticed difference in my body after 30 days, highly recommend, jillian really did a good job, will do on a regular basis to maintain, my body
B009AMALLM|4.0|This installment is the PERFECT \\"Lead In\\" to PA5!<br />Let me preface, I LOVED 1 and 2 and was extremely disappointed with PA3. With the exception of the addition of the Witch Coven/Cult I thought it was very lame.  Shortly into PA4 I realized just how important the back story of PA3 was to the continuation of the franchise.  While this one DOES take a little longer to get moving it is well worth the wait for the last Terrifying sequence.  (This coming from a guy that does NOT scare)  As you watch the ending it is a clear set-up for the physical manifestation of the Demon in PA5.  For all of you hating on this film for its slow build up and \\"few scares\\", i have this to say to you:  Grow Up or go back to your Action Junkie Films.  For MY MONEY?  the best Endings are worth waiting for and i strongly believe that this Series is about to \\"Get Real\\" with the expanded addition of the Coven.  So QUIT HATING and Enjoy.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Challenging, fun game great graphics, it is as much fun as the other Temple games and it was free, I highly recommend this!
B00865P3AS|5.0|If you liked 2CELLOS first endeaver, you'll love this one. Buy it!!! My mother and I love the cello and this CD does not disappoint.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Saw this with my gf and we both liked it, while acknowledging this is a different movie than the other Bourne offerings. Expect better and more dialogue. The new guy can act, and is not nearly as super human, but more interesting. Some cool chase scenes, but I wish there were a few more fight scenes. All in all, I would still see another Bourne movie. I think the new guy here is a much better actor - at least in this series, though not as tough in some ways as the Damon character. There is a lot more dialogue, so patience is required before getting to the action we all expect, but it comes..
B002ZG981E|5.0|Great movie...love it!  On the edge of your seat the whole time!  Non stop action.  A must see movie! Enjoy
B00942S4OY|5.0|This new album had a very nice sound.  We like how the songs are catchy.  I find myself(Mom) singing along to some of the lyrics even though the album belongs to my daughters who adore One Direction.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|What sincere voices with great range and depth.  Hope they stay together for 5-10 years as their vocal skills mature.  I will buy their next album/CD, for sure.
1250027624|5.0|This is a terrific coffee table book that is brimming with photographs, informative facts and tidbits, not just about the show and its characters, but also about the times.  Incredible details about the magazines, clothing, customs, and mood of the day.  I find myself reaching for this book more often than I imagined I would, simply because the rich details about the cast and the historical references are so fascinating.
B000ICLRJ8|4.0|I love this movie, particularly the sound and special effects and the overall cinematography which made this a natural fit for my blue-ray collection. The packaging looked and felt flimsy and the cover looked like something you made off your own printer was I was a bit nervous that I had been ripped off but apparently that was all done so they could sell it so cheap.<br /><br />Watched it as soon as it came in the mail and it didn't disappoint and rocked my surround sound.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I downloaded it yesterday and I got to play it. I try to play the game today and it brings me to my home menu on my kindle. I keep on clicking it but it does the same thing
B00AMSLRAC|4.0|I rarely pay for apps for my daughter as there are so many free ones out there but the Dr. Panda series is definitely worth it. Taken by themselves, any of the games can get a little repetitive so if you're looking for apps to keep your little ones occupied on car rides/etc. I would recommmend spending the $4 or $5 and getting all of them. The graphics are clean. The interaction is easy to understand and there are lots of different touchpoints on the screen to explore beyond the premise of each game. Dr. Panda games have been the absolute best games I've found for my 3.5 yo daughter.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Fast pace comment on why government needs to be kept small and limited. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I've been waiting for &#34;Toca Kitchen&#34; to make it's way to the kindle app store (only available from the apple store at the moment) but when I saw this I jumped on it. These people really know how to make a fun and interactive game that is perfect for Toddlers and young children. The game gives you lots of options for styling, coloring and treating hair and they even throw in an assortment of accessories to dress up your character when done. I look forward to the next Toca release for the Kindle Fire.
B0091REZMW|4.0|very intriguing game. if you like seek and find games this is perfect for you. its fun. it is a little confusing on directions.  I just wing it.
0553375636|4.0|I liked the first book well enough. You can't really go wrong with the standard fantasy formula of the under-dog hero with unrealized special powers and over-the-top antagonist. The Mistborn trilogy did it well, heck even Star Wars and Harry Potter used the same formula.<br /><br />The second book picks up the pace a bit with the hero growing into some of his powers and the bad guy beginning to reveal himself and really take shape. There is still more than a fair bit of skulking about and whining by the hero but he offsets this by some pretty great feats of bravery.<br /><br />The writing continues to impress me and the characters (while sometimes more charicture than character) are very intriguing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are tons of games to choose from all of them are different and easy to learn. Great for passing the time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book I just don't really like the title of the book I like the new book out called Young Paranoid Bank Robbers
B0010X745K|3.0|This is another King story with all his familiar story bits. There is the siege in a small retail establishment from Maximum Overdrive. There is the king stand-in with his small merry band of archtype followers. There is the young boy. There is the fanatic. There are the religious overtones. There are the mindless monsters. There is the army project gone wrong. Its not bad. But its like a random assembly of things that King has done in stories before. I'm influenced by the fact that I've seen so much of this sort of thing. If someone were coming to it a more fresh way, it would be better.<br /><br />The religious stuff is too over the top and too quickly developed to be credible. Marcia Gay Harden does a great job with the part anyway and gives it more credibility by acting that then story/script does.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are not paced quite right or thought through properly. There is the scene in the store were the bright lights are set up while the store is being attacked. There is a lot of standing around in the pharmacy after it becomes very clear that they should leave.<br /><br />The casting is above average. Frank Darabont does an excellent job directing it. But really nothing special. The ending is particularly pointless and awful.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The best of me is a great book and be read countless times a book kind of like this one is Young Paranoid Bank Robbers
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is full of awesome little challenges and tests your reflexes. It helps with your coordination reactions and its family friendly. I play with my friends and family and connect to facebook to brag!
B004ULNJIU|3.0|This was a little hard to get into because of the British language.  They use so many different words than we do that sometimes you don't understand what is going on in this movie.  Jason Statham as always is good in the action department but he talks so low some times you don't know what he is doing.  All in all this is a very nice  movie with action.  I can't say I truly love it, but maybe if I watch it a couple more times I will get to understand it better.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book. It made me hopeful that one day, my Chihuahua, Cha Cha, when her time comes, will return to me someday. I love her so much and she loves me. This was such a touching and inspiring story of a dog's and master's never-ending love for each other!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is a classic!  It is a film that shows you determination, love and a willingness to be a kind and loving human being in a comical way.  It is a film for all ages.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Any new film by Steven Spielberg has me salivating at the prospect of seeing it. I was not disappointed with his latest big movie. I would suggest that it is his most talkative film. It is almost non stop dialogue. Punctuated by scenes of war. Always as darkly lit as those candle times, it is the director's only Victorian picture.<br /><br />The opening is gruesome hand to hand, edge of screen to edge of screen combat. From then on the film is all about the words that are fought for. The two lads who could recite his Gettysburg address, the Confederate peacemakers who lament their loss of culture and history. The words which make up the 13th Amendment: the words 'freedom' and 'slavery.'<br /><br />And let's not forget business. The South had an unfair advantage over the North particularly in agriculture. The discovery of oil and how it replaced the need for human slaves was not mentioned or alluded to.<br /><br />Where the movie works really well is the back-room politicking and the court-room like atmosphere of the Senate floor. Memories of [[ASIN:B001GLX6UI Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]] and particularly the brilliant [[ASIN:B000IZXRRA Inherit the Wind]] were amply fortified by the director's harnessing of tension and suspense. I was leaning forward in my reclining chair. Transfixed. I also enjoyed the contrast between the strident emotions of Sally Field as the First Lady verses the cool perceptions of her husband. She could also verbally joust with the best of them.<br /><br />For all the magnetism of the Day-Lewis central performance Mr Spielberg succeeds in making the words within the movie resonate with a twenty first century audience. Make no mistake: this is American propaganda. The intellect and human appreciation of the former President is seen to be the driving force behind the historic decision to end slavery in the USA. Those who naively believe there is such a thing as race will be floored by Lincoln. The closing scenes beautifully illustrating the human bed covers all words into one. Love.man bed covers all words into one. Love.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I have never really played a Persona game before and didn't really know what to expect.  This game is great, the exploring ,story, adventuring, characters, and battle system....wow.  This game is amazing and I'm now wondering if I should play the previous games when I'm done with this one.  This isn't my typical kind of game but I couldn't recommend this enough even if you have never played a Persona game before.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|I liked this movie right after seeing it. But the more I thought about all the plot holes, the the less i began to respect the writing in this movie. Now that I have had some time to think about it, I can say I hate this movie, and never want to see it again. I wont get into the confusing arguments about \\"this happened because, the younger self did yada yada yada\\",  but I will say that after the last act of the film... NONE of the events prior should have happened -- but it did happen even though \\"Character XYZ\\" NEVER EXISTED. People still remember \\"Character XYZ\\" even though he/she NEVER EXISTED. This movie makes up its own rules to avoid paradoxes. These rules violate basic causality. This movie had some nice effects, and JGL's performance was really cool, but the lack of logic behind the basic premise if the movie is maddening.
B009FXIICK|5.0|My 5 year old daughter plays this a lot on my Kindle Fire. It is a big hit with her.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Fun game, but got bored playing the same three after a while.  Will probably upgrade to a paid version, if available, eventually.
B004I6JJTU|4.0|For being an original pressing of the album, the vinyl is in excellent condition. The cover was a little beat up, but I can understand that and am perfectly satisfied.
B000WDS1OC|2.0|For about 2 decades this was my absolute favorite shoe. One pair lasted me a whole decade with heavy use (almost every day in fall, winter & spring). They were the best combination of rugged work shoe (without a steel shank), sportiness & dressier look. While they weren't completely waterproof, regular treatment to the leather meant my feet stayed dry in light rain or if I was caught off guard. The sole was thick enough & high enough off the ground that water/sludge never seeped in. The seems were extremely well sewn & never once frayed, nor did the eyelets fall out. Even the original leather shoe laces lasted. While the sole wore some, particularly on the outer edge of the heel (i was a heavy over pronator), the ridges in the sole never wore down flat in a decade. I don't remember if the soles were originally Vibram or not, but they were fairly slip-proof.<br /><br />So when I needed a 3rd pair (about 7 years ago), I picked up some at a Timberland outlet store (slightly blemished, but regular quality). I noticed they were now made in China (don't know if it's changed since then), but didn't hesitate since they were also on sale for what seemed like a good price. While they might not be as poor as some shoes from China, the reduced quality was noticeable in about 6 months: first the leather layer in the floor bed separated from the shoe, sliding all around (I had to use crazy glue to keep it in place). Then they scuffed much more easily. Then water seeped in despite maintaining them as I had the 2 previous pairs. Then the seems started to unravel, shoe laces broke, eyelets fell off. The sole became slippery...all in less than 3 years. I was even wearing them less than my old pairs because of the problems.<br /><br />Despite liking Timberland's sizing (they accommodate my larger, particularly wider feet better), I stopped buying Timberland because they shifted production out of the US (with a noticeable drop in quality) while keeping their prices high. I don't mind paying a premium for a good shoe, I do mind paying premium for junk.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great time killer,  lots of puzzles come with it.  Many more available in app for download.  Well worth the $1 to remove ads.
030758836X|2.0|I had to read this book since it was the top of so many lists and best seller lists. I didn't enjoy the writing style at all and found it very confusing. How she switched the narrative from character to character. I didn't enjoy it at all, and I'm a psychology major. Unfortunately I found that my favorite author of all time had read this book and enjoyed it, but that just goes to show that not all books are for everyone. However since I didn't enjoy this book of her's I most likely won't be reading any more of her books. I was right in being able to guess how each character would act within the plot but that could just be luck. I definitely didn't like the way that she switched the narratives while one character was retelling an event or part of the story. Her writing style made it hard for me to read. But if your a fan of her writing than this wouldn't be the case. Also if you like somewhat dark topics and the ways in which people manipulate other people then this book will be enjoyable for you. I didn't like that aspect, also the perspective in which she unfolds their marriage was a little unsettling, but that could be because I'm not familiar with these issues and is an error on my part. I didn't find it much of a psychological thriller, but that's my personal opinion.
B00633W614|5.0|This was a wonderful book, great plot and a page turner, didn't want to put it down. Easy read you will love it
B008D19WBQ|2.0|You could say I'm a big fan. I've had the entire DVD series for years - my husband actually ripped them for me so I could watch it from our media server (it's easier/faster than dealing with discs). I watch Friends every single day - it's on right now! When my husband heard that Friends was coming out on Blu-ray he surprised me with this HD version boxed set and I was so freaking excited I can't even-- it was so sweet of him! But I started noticing something was off about my episodes. Little parts or scenes, and quotes that I remember... were missing. I thought it was my memory, that they were on another episode or something. But there's this ONE quote I was positive was in S4 E2 because it had sparked a whole conversation between my husband and me that had led to us watching Star Trek (his favorite show) which I had NEVER seen before (yeah, I know) but it's now my new favorite show. But that small snip of a scene was gone! Just poof! So I came on here to see if anyone else had noticed any &#34;cuts&#34; and I found I was not alone and it wasn't just one but a tons of cuts! I am so, so, so, bummed about this. For the super fans of this show (who know every line, every scene) this is a huge no-no.  We would rather watch the standard (aka &#34;fuzzy&#34;) edition than miss out on those great one-liners.<br /><br />- The missing bit I am talking about  is where Rachel is trying to make Ross angry by saying things he doesn't agree with. -<br /><br />Rachel: Jurassic Park could happen.<br />(Ross wants to say something)<br /><br />[missing bit]<br />Rachel: And you know what? Actually, I do think Kirk was smarter than Spock.<br />(Ross wants to say something again, but just slowly leaves)<br />Rachel and Chandler giggle.<br />Chandler: You were kidding about the Kirk-Spock-thing, though right?
0140186395|5.0|read the book for class I enjoyed it I mean it is one of the greatest classics so it had to be at least alright....but I did enjoy the story and the seller was very professional with this purchase so I am satisfied
B0029XFNAI|5.0|I don't usually like remakes of old classic films but this one is an exception. Both my daughter and I have a copy.

B000FC1GJW|5.0|This is the best by far out of the His Dark Materials series.  I like how this book unlike the last one makes Lyra  and Will equals and also follows the stories of others like Mrs. Coulter and Mary Malone.  I do wish that the had a happier ending though. Also the ending seems unfinished and almost requires a fourth book.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Who does not love Smallville?  I have now completed the entire Smallville series in my library.  Hopefully my grandchildren will one day want to see the story.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Seriously, if the flood of 5-star reviews hasn't convinced you to give this one a shot - I'll throw my hat in the pool.  Just rented this, and am on my way to purchase the music.  This story is truly incredible.  For the people that are on the fence, give it a rental.  If you enjoy an awesome documentary and like rock n' roll - buy this one.  It will be a music legend for ages to come.  I enjoyed this one immensely.
1933952806|5.0|This book helps to understand what is unquestionably the best camera out for the advanced photographer.  The bells and whistles of the camera make it necessary to study the manual and this book takes you beyond the manual.

B008ASGP3U|4.0|Well-written and compelling, I liked this more than the most recent Rebus mysteries. Rebus's new civilian status post-retirement offers some interesting possibilities and conundrums. We also get more of Siobahn Clark, a character I like a lot. (She needs her own series!) Rebus is beginning to be more self aware. It's not leading to changed behavior, yet, though it is a start. I didn't like the addition of Malcolm Fox - since he is a protagonist in other Rankin books, it's hard to route against him here, but have him as the main character in books like The Complaints. Also, I would have liked a little more exposition about the motive of the perpetrator. This is a book about Rebus, not the crime or criminal, but I still felt it ended a bit abruptly.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|A very interesting and well done historical film. I think the acting was great and managed to hold my interest.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game. very fun to play great graphics!  wonderful layout. great planning would recommend this game to all ages and genders!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good graphics and good storyline. Fun hidden object game with option to play Monoco if you cannot find objects. Worth the download.
B0085HWZDK|4.0|I enjoyed the music and the group, but it is still hard for me to separate Robert Plant from Led Zepplin.... who in my mind is still the best Rock band ever.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my daughter is in Luv with it! she cant stop!!!!!!! I like it myself my daughter is always talking about it and luvs
B008EZVNO0|2.0|Because the one he's been following for the past 12 years -- turning out music that's bland and boring with lyrics that are increasingly grumpy and uninteresting -- is really, really getting stale. After 45 years of eagerly awaiting his next new release, this is the first VM album I've listened to that I wouldn't pay 5¢ to own. Given this man's incredible talent and catalogue, that's ... well ... just sad.
1455502758|3.0|Hitchens revealed true human dignity and heroism in the face of death. But here is the question; can the atheists account for dignity, heroism, do unto others as you would have them do unto you, etc? No, he cannot and neither can any non Christian. The fact of the matter is only the Christian Worldview can make sense of human dignity and indeed why we should be dignified and respectful towards others. The atheist has no reason to be Dignified or brave. Even Hitchens functions with Christian presuppositions while denying the Christian God.  I wonder if Mr. Hitchens would be so tough when he stands before almighty God one day who he claims isn't great, or perhaps when he is faced with an eternity in Hell. We can only speculate, but I bet you it Mr Hitchens won't have the same stubborn grin on his face!<br />Mr. Hitchens also confuses Christianity with Roman Catholicism. Christianity saves your soul from eternal hell fire. Roman Catholicism, like all religions cannot save you! Why, according to Mr. Hitchens should the Pope or Mr Hitchens himself exhibit good moral values if it doesn't suit them in a given situation? They don't believe in judgment day, why not kill and steal as it suits them, it wouldn't be inconsistent with their Godless Worldview. But it would be inconsistent for the Blood washed Christian to act in such ways.
B007HACDLK|4.0|What a hero. Those like him help me sleep at night knowing the world is a safer place with special ops hunting terrorists.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Great when ur at school and need a Dictionary. Also its great when ur trying to prove someone wrong about something they said.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|What a shame I never heard of this guy while he was alive. Like a great artist his words will live for generations.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Great game and its easy enough to entertain my kids. Just wish the coins regenerated quicker so my two year old wouldn't freak out.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Thrilling until the very end. Mostly believable. Very entertaining.<br />President's son, hiding secret squirrel spy stuff from mom & dad?  Not realistic.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game but it won't update on my kindle fire. Doesn't mean it's bad. Still awesome. Get it
B00A12VW86|5.0|Great Greenday album for those who have been a fan of their work over their career... they hit styles from all of their popular albums, not just the most recent, so it's nice to see them head back towards their roots on a few tracks.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was an awesome book you have to read this !!!! This is one of my favorite's in the dairy of a wimpy kid series
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|Great Greenday album for those who have been a fan of their work over their career... they hit styles from all of their popular albums, not just the most recent, so it's nice to see them head back towards their roots on a few tracks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great!!! I didn't think it would be so good.. but I even paused mine craft to play it¡¡Lots of fun, and addicting too.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|As horror/devil movies go this was at least a four star. Enjoyed watching. The plot was involved enough to make it believable. Supposed to be based on true story.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|This product is okay... it looks good. I like the quality of the materials. The ability to make the Kindle stand up while using it is really good. What is not good is that the Kindle mini-usb cable is on the inside of the the case, and you cannot keep the case closed while charging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. It's addicting. I play it all the time. I'm so glad I found this free game.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This was a worthless piece of junk.  There was a terrible echo during conversations that could not be remedied.  Actually, according to LIFEPROOF, it was counterfeit.  It has been returned and I expect to be refunded,
B0088TG252|5.0|By the time the movie ends, you will begin to wonder just what the real world is all about. In most instances, films reflect reality, and this by golly is one good flick. You will think twice about &#34;I'm from the government and am here to help&#34;!
B005LAII12|1.0|We could not watch this movie. The total sexual and constant filthy talk made us take this movie off and thrown into garbage where it really belongs.  Why was there no rating listed.  It said unrated but that was all.  How would we know it was so trashy/
B006WPSQVC|5.0|As a dad, I wish I had seen this film 40 years ago. Even today, it reminds me of the joy in being a father, grandfather, and great grandfather. It is good for everyone at all ages and even for those who are thinking about marriage. There is a lot more to being a father than just being a name.
B00992CF6W|5.0|there is one big problom and I think notch needs to fix it its a killing machien and it cant be stooped it is a really good game except there is person named him don't say his real name I started a world and there was someone on a mountain and I was not on multiplayer I started mining and it came down and killed me I was so sad so I delighted the game then got it again I was ok but beware he's watching but still play the game it's really fun just get prepared for 1.2
B00846TTDG|5.0|OK, so it is not a great program for the wee ones, but for everyone else, it is great. Story line, actors, the whole film is just great. A kind of reminder of why we have our military.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|I rated this DVD as 5 star because I think Andrea Bocelli and David Foster make a great team.  It is a very entertaining DVD both touching and inspirational.  I think Andrea Bocelli is the best singer and the orchestra back up is just wonderful.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I bounce between a 3 &amp; 4 because I really enjoy playing this game, BUT you will have to spend real money (and unless you catch a sale, it could be a fairly high amount) to buy gems to unlock main characters (such as Rarity) to finish quests (and ultimately to finish the game) and take the chance that your gems randomly disappear. You also will have to recruit friends to get hearts because there is no other way to get them, and then you're lucky if your friends show up in your social tab...<br />All in all, it's fun and addicting but very buggy and impossible to finish without spending some real money.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|There are some fine moments -- Thomas and James sorting it out near the end for instance; the beauty of the Scottish landscape, etc. but the writer finds no way to develop the relationship between Matthew and Mary other than to have them off each other or sentimentally enrapt with little in the way of nuances.  This lack of development reflects a lack of imagination or interest in complex human interaction.  Since the first two seasons were primarily driven by the chemistry between these two characters and the possibilities of bringing them together, this two dimensional and clumsy handling of their marriage has the effect of letting all the air out of the balloon.  Instead, we get a shifting of focus from one relationship or situation to another to keep us interested.  It works for a time but sooner or later the audience wants to be fed and most of what transpires is not satisfying.  Killing off characters is dramatic as death has a way of stealing a scene or two, but good drama it is not.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love this show, will watch again , just ordered the 3 rd season, still watching the 2 nd season, can't wait
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Read it ...great story..interesting to get the German perspective.  While I still felt the German atrocities were unacceptable it was good to see many Germans hated the war too.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|One of the most engaging books I've read in a while. It has a beautiful storyline that just sucked me in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome with tons of updates all the time there is so much to do get this game it is so awesome btw I love the carector Lucy she is awesome at it
0345529057|5.0|Very engaging story with many different threads that weave together and complex characters that don't always fit into the easy classification of good and bad.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I am addicted to the game. It has very good game play and can be entertaining for hours. it's absolutely perfect and I haven't stopped playing other than for school and necessary breaks, and since I'm a college student that just goes to show how good the game is.<br /><br />The ONLY problem with this game is that it makes it hard to advance without paying extra money to buy &quot;bling&quot; or &quot;kibble&quot;. Although it is cheap, it may be annoying or difficult for a young child to play this.<br /><br />But if you have a buck or two to spend, this game is perfect to spend it on.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great series. It inspired the family to read together and have our own book club. Hope you enjoy it too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I haven't been a big reader for entertainment in several years. I just finished my Masters Degree in May 2012, and my wife bought me a Kindle for our Anniversary in October 2012. I read several books in a wide range of genres, but non in science fiction. I decided to seek out a great science fiction book. This one had fantastic reviews so I decided to check it out. It was amazing! I am absolutely hooked. I have read all the Shift books too. I recommend Mr. Howey as an author to anyone, whether they are a fan of the science fiction genre or not.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Once I started reading I didn't want to put it down. Rebus doing what he is good at, sleuthing, asking questions and ferreting out information. Having to cope with modern methods of information gathering. Malcolm Fox muddying the waters. Hopefully Rebus is back, please Mr Rankin
0802798225|2.0|I read about this one in the ALA's feature \\"What They're Reading for Fun\\" in which school librarians reveal what kids and teens are clamoring to borrow from libraries.  This book sounded intriguing as it's a classic Romeo and Juliet story of \\"opposites attract.\\"  A tough, Latino, gang member boy attracts a rich Caucasian girl whose 'perfect life' is less than perfect when seen from the inside of her swanky mansion.  I love a good Y-A novel full of fast plotting, snappy dialogue, and blossoming feelings of adulthood.  Who doesn't?  Well, this was not one of those books.  I'd give it a \\"meh.\\" The heroine is annoying and narcissistic.  The hero doesn't explain to her why he has to stay in the gang.  The happy ending feels rushed and contrived.  Leave this one to the teenagers, ladies.
B001BPJJ9G|3.0|Rich imagery: where did the film maker find an entire village painted in blue highlights. The child-star takes the film as a nexus for all that follows: plot, imagery, especially morality. The story and style  are presented &#34;campy.&#34; As simple as the story is on some levels, I found that I gained more on re-seeing on dvd from my first viewing on the big screen
0525478817|5.0|I first saw this one in the list of \\"Best of January 2012\\" books sent out by Amazon.  The reviews and description intrigued me right away.  This is a love story between two teens who meet in a cancer support group.  With that kind of synopsis, you know you're going to wind up crying at some point, right?  What you can't expect is how much you're going to enjoy the experience.  It's like watching Steel Magnolias, or Brian's Song, or Love Story.  You boo hoo like it's your own personal tragedy.  Plus, you get to think about LIFE and LOVE (yes, the kind of big thoughts that require all caps.)  At the end, you sigh and wish the book would keep going.  I found myself digging in my bedside table at midnight, looking for a pencil so I could underline passages to read again later.  I quoted whole passages into my Facebook status because they were just too amazing not to share.  I bought two freaking copies of the book so I could shove it into my friends' hands right away!  I just found a new book for my \\"top five of my life\\" list.  What else can I say?  Go read it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn starts you on one path and throws you an unexpected curve or two. Amazing Amy (wife of the husband) lives up to her name and in ways you will either admire or fear her. Be prepared to laugh from time to time, which I did not expect.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|i hate it. it made me restart 2 times. it pops up to the imagi studios then pops back to my main screen.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Works great!  Stands easily in both positions.  Added more weight than I thought it would.  With most cases I do not notice the weight but with this one I did.  Not enough to deter me from buying it though.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This game is so much better than the first, which was great. It has amazing graphics for an app, is incredibly addicting, and fun. However, I can only play on my friends' phones at the moment, because after a couple of games on this, it died. Every time I try to open it, it force closes on me :(
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun. Best virtual city game I have ever played. I think I will be playing this for a while.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Addictive.  But fun, doesn't take a lot of concentration.  Way to pass time when waiting for something.  It is free.
B005UBNKZG|4.0|the Processor is excellent.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and get a new CPU cooler.<br /><br />the included CPU cooler can not do the job and the processor will over heat and shutdown. runs super hot at  160 F
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Recommanded by a friend I decided to give it chance, because I've never heard of that series (I'm from Québec, Canada). WOW! I was stick on my TV: realistic, punchy, unpredictable, well acted.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My children and I really enjoyed watching Hotel Transylvania. Great movie to choose for the entire family to watch and enjoy. vent.
B003HARV4S|4.0|I liked it, was a good movie. The only part I disliked was that he didnt really have any real magic, was kinda disappointing.
B008K6DU4Y|2.0|It don't remember  this app. But it probably didn't have the songs I was searching or looking for. Yep thats it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. It's filled with so much love and hope. It makes you want to cry and laugh at the same time. A must read
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I love this app very much. When I get on my Kindle this is the first thing I will get on.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It was a great book it it was fun and cool I hope he makes a book two about this journey!
B00004W3L3|5.0|I am a lifelong progressive rock fan and find it hard to believe how bad popular music has become. I finally started to experiment into \\"neo-prog\\" with mixed results. Most of the bands are good but not great except for Marillion with Fish and Porcupine Tree.<br />Misplaced Childhood is brilliant from beginning to end, as one song flows into the next with beautiful arrangements and mellodies. At first I thought Fish's voice was too much of a copy of Peter Gabriel's but soon I could appreciate what a great singer and song writer Fish truely is. Steve Rothery's guitar work also stands out as being very tasteful and melodic.<br />The current version of Marillion, without Fish, is terrible (based on the album \\"Marbles\\").<br />I would highly recommend Misplaced Childhood to anyone who loves early and mid stages of Genesis.<br />This album gave me the same enjoyment I had with classic prog bands, just as I was giving up hope in newer quality music.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Chilling and fanciful, &#34;Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children&#34; is a story of a teenage boy who doesn't quite fit in. I greatly enjoyed the author's elegant and descriptive writing style.
B00005U8EM|4.0|It's &#34;Groundhog Day&#34;. What else is there to say? Even though it was a gift, I own a copy myself.<br />This one came with all the special features and was the anniversary edition and I paid only $7.00 for it brand new. So, assuming you can find a new copy for $7.00, too it's an awesome deal!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is such a great app! It is amazing! The graphics are so good! When do you ever get chased by a humongous monkey? I tottaly suggest this app!!!
B009GESJH2|5.0|This is a awesome cd it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this cd are<br /><br />Tracks<br /><br />1. Chickens In The Pen<br />4. Detroit, Michigan<br />5. Rebel Soul<br />7. Happy New Year<br />8. Celebrate<br />11. Cucci Galore<br /><br />if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
B00003CXTG|5.0|I love this movie with its romantic story and ending.  Very realistic action scenes.  What can I say just that I love it!
B000ICM5O4|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
B007JGAR6U|5.0|You could not ask for a better match to your Fujifilm X-Series camera, especially the retro-look X10/20/100 or X-Pro1.  This flash is small, powerful, and has bulletproof metal construction to match your camera.  True, it does not tilt or swivel like its bigger cousin the EF-20, but it can be used as an off-camera remote for special lighting purposes which is handy.  And it has a built-in diffuser for wide angle.  The controls are simple and cover a wide variety of shooting scenarios.  With this little addition to your kit bag you will cover 90% of what you need in a flash, and in style!
1582701709|5.0|this book is a true life changer..I read it over and over and finally order the dvd, so I can get the real view.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I wish they would make the update for the kindle fire.  on the phone it has baby animals plz make the update for it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These were such amazing books, I hope a movie turkey comes out and more books, I would love to hear more about her family. And his perspective was so entertaining, It makes me sad that I'm done for now. Thank you for such great books!
B0072OFM28|5.0|I like all the series so for, And will be adding the 4th set when they come out, It is a lot like our government today, a lot of under the table deals and setups, one-ups manship. which does little to help the masses.
0399230033|3.0|I have two boys under age 2, and for Christmas my husband and I opted to give them mostly books. I added this one to my cart not realizing there isn't much story in this book, mostly just a picture book. Don't get me wrong, the illustrations are adorable and we can &#34;make up&#34; a story as we go along or play a game of name-the-animal. But it's not exactly what I expected or prefer. I like a children's book with cute illustrations AND a nice story.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I like the spartacus series, and his one is very good, I wound recommend this to those that like a lot of fighting.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A lot of detail. It can be addicting and fun looking forward to advancing to higher levels and multiple horses.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|It was to bad that the main actor died after this first series, I think he was more of a real gentle person than the other two. But that being said, I will still buy the 4th series, and any other series that will be forthcoming.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|È semplicemente fighissimo!!!!!<br />Merita veramente!!!!!!<br />Bisognerebbe metterlo a pagamento xké merita veramente molto!!!!!!!<br />Bravi sviluppatori.<br />Questo gioco lo consiglio a tutti!!!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|It's a great manual on &#34;how to&#34;, even for PC challenged people like me. It's concise and very easy to follow.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have a lot of fun with this game I really feel like in having my own horse. great game
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I have this app on my I phone. It is even better on the Kindle. So entertaining and the graphics are beautiful. I highly recommend getting this app.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Finally I found something that I can just have to write in. I love writing stories so this is great for me. You can have as many notebooks on this as you want. I don't think that I can go without it. I have started early on my career. It is just writing little short books for my family. It works great I write them on there and then read them to my family. If you write you should get this app.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I chose this item because it was rated high on Amazon's recommended list.  This book is targeted for a teen audience, however I completely enjoyed it.  I laughed out loud through most of the book and then cried like a baby during other parts.  I recommend this book to all ages.  If you liked Twilight, you will like this book.  Note: Just ordinary kids...no vampires!  Good read!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is epic but updates are slower and Apple comes out with faster updates. I wish there was  faster updates
1451695195|5.0|I couldn't put this one down until I had read it cover-to-cover. This book should put to rest any questions or doubts people may have about the next phase of our existence. Dr. Alexander is uniquely qualified to render scientifically-based explanations regarding his near-death experiences, but he delivers them in words a layman can understand.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very interesting. Got to say I was very surprised just how it can keep you on your toes. Or should I say sneakers & different boards. LOL!! Was glad to see the up grade, but it could of been a little more entertaining if it had different levels included.
B008D36INE|5.0|Excellent movie, superb cast! I definitely empathized with the characters. Admittedly, I will watch anything with Tom Hiddleston in it, hands down. However, this particular movie not only resonated with me but also showcased the talents of each actor perfectly. My only qualm is it was a little slow in starting and, of course, I would have loved a happy ending between the two lovers. I kept hoping Freddy would go back to Hester, but then, it would not have been the type of movie it was meant to be. The elder chracters portray in their short appearances what true love really is: longsuffering, patience and kindness. There's still hope for all of us at least, even if not for the characters in the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is  absolutely amazing. It take  a little bit of skill but after you play it for a while you get the hang of it and its really fun and entertaining.<br /> I have had no problems  with it ever
B0038WCC62|5.0|A great album! It sounds so warm on wax. It was well worth the small price I paid for it.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|while i like the camera it is hard to center the picture because there is no focus window on the other side so to take pictures you have to try and get your subject into the window without viewing it. consequently you lose a lot of picture and have to keep taking it until you center it. I think it might be better for videos but i haven't tried it yet.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I just could of used a diffeant ending it was really great intellect the end it was like jumping off a cliff into (nothing)  the end sucked I hated it I wanted closure on a great but but was let down.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My family went to see this at the movies it was so funny! I highly reccomend this movie! Very few people review this movie under four stars
B000E1YVZU|5.0|It has so much music and I love the bonus stuff on the other Cd over all rent is a musical classic. And such a great movie that stick with u
B004TTHLBE|5.0|This is kind of like the Smithsonian....there's almost too much in it to really take in. So many references to various mythologies and religious icons, which I have an interest in, that it was overwhelming but in a good way. I really, really would love to see a movie adaptation. Of course it would be 4 hours long but I would be enthralled.
B007SGM084|5.0|These three books have been the best books, love all the details. She makes it seem like you are the character. can't wait for the movie :)
B00459GJUM|5.0|Better the show, the faster the cancel.  I think if a show requires the use of your brain for more than five minutes it gets cancelled.  TV land is littered with victim TV shows (Jericho, Journeyman and the killed before it's time FireFly).  Stargate Universe relies more on cerebral analysis of the crews situation and less on odd looking aliens with weird headgear.  Anyone who liked the Battlestar Galatica remake will enjoy this show.  Give it a shot.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Obviously not photoshop, but just as much fun. I would rather do this than play the games.  I just have to get enough photos in to keep me busy. The presets are very nice, I particularly like the colored pen where you can draw and write on your images.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|We all know Breaking Bad is an awesome show.  AMC is doing a good job putting out quality television.  I recommend this show to anyone.  This season ended with a bag.  Literally.  Best ending to a season I have ever seen in my life. Trust me, you will think so too.  Unfortunately, they must have fired the writing staff from season 4 because season 5 is terrible. Oh well.
0802473156|5.0|Great book. We give it away to our married friends!  It works!!
0156141647|5.0|I definitely couldn't top the first review. This book is as she says, it is great reading especially for a deep and feeling type of person. I would just add my impression that Charles Lindbergh was first interested in Ann's sister and I got the impression he lost interest when he found about her heart condition which ultimately led to her early death. I think Ann over romanticized him in the beginning and they were very different from each other. He was much more of the typical stoic man, unlike Ann who was so romantic and emotional. I think he wanted to marry into this family one way or another, they were rich and were a great family where his family was lame to non-existant. They stayed together a long time considering how different they were. I'm digressing a bit but this is a great book I read all of her journals. This is what people did before the internet I guess. Wrote letters and journals. This one is worth a read though. unlike mine. who could top the amazing life and reflections of AML?
B00280LYIM|2.0|It was a ok book but I would say it wasn't that good as the first three it needed more unexpected twist .
B006H5120E|4.0|Wife has watched the original many times.  this upgrade is nicely done.  will get to watch it many more times.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|I enjoyed this film especially the scene where the gang wind up in the forest surrounded by scantily clad women. Great dialogue, acting and special effects. You get used to the american cast doing english accents. Check out the Wise Wizard that Franco and McBride have to visit as he is like a gay Yoda. Charles Dance, Damien Lewis and Toby Jones also star. If you like this then you should find Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Evil Dead 3, Monty Python.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Looking to expand the 3D collection and had seen this at the movie theatre.  Not as good as the big screen but still a good addition to the collection.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This was a great sci-fi film. Great acting from Willis, Levitt, Daniels, Blunt and the little boy. Fans of time travel stories must see this. A clever and refreshing film.
B00867GKIK|4.0|Like the movie and needed another 3D movie for the grand kids.  This one has something for everyone and shows well in 3D
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book is an amazing sequal to an already great book. Its definetly worth the money and long hours to read it. You'll get hooked and not want to put it down. I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is a fantastic album! I checked out a few of the videos on YouTube and came here to Amazon to see which songs I wanted to download - after previewing them, I bought the whole album, they are THAT good. I especially like &#34;Carry On&#34; and &#34;Out on the Town&#34; oh and &#34;Step by Step&#34; and.....well, you get the point. Buy it!<br /><br />Oh and Amazon is even more awesome too, they loaded the whole thing on my &#34;cloud&#34; storage here and now I can listen wherever I go!<br /><br />Rock on fun! Hope you get your Grammy!
B004NELBPC|5.0|This is a great app, you can choose which are your interests, and the system would filter only the news that you choose (let´s say: politics, world, music, etc). Works fast, and never crash.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I was so happy when this finally came out on BluRay! World of Warcraft has a series of Indiana Jones tribute quests (&#34;Harrison Jones&#34;) in Uldum (and other places) and it got me thinking about how much I loved these movies, but I didn't want to buy it until it was on BluRay. So glad I waited, it was awesome to watch on a home theater system - just like being a kid again watching it at the movies. Fun way to spend a rainy Saturday with an Indiana Jones triple feature.<br /><br />The extra features are plentiful and it really is a must have for the fan.<br /><br />The series should have stopped at 3; I'll probably use the Crystal Skull disk as a coaster.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Enjoyed my first book on ny kindle. it was an easy read,the plot was easy to follow despite the surprises
B0001I561E|5.0|Yep, Disney does a fairy tale like no one else. Aladdin is of the fewer Disney cartoons with a male lead and one which is great for boys and girls. Robin Williams is insane as the genie - what a fabulous performance.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|For years I couldn't stand listening to this guy--for some reason I've learned to appreciate his talent.  Great Christmas CD<br />especially his duet with Ella.
0525953728|5.0|This is a well written account of the Navy Seal career of Mark Owen (pseudonym), culminating in the mission on 5/1/11 which resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />The book is much more than a chronicle of the events of that day. Owen provides some personal background, describing how he grew up in Alaska and first learned to handle guns at the direction of his father. He wanted to be a Navy Seal from an early age, but at his fathers request he went to college first, and only enlisted after finishing his degree. He also decided to join as an enlisted soldier, not as an officer, so that he could be more directly involved in the action, and the book takes us through the extensive training required, and then several of the key missions that he participated in, leading up to the Bin Laden raid.<br /><br />The descriptions of all of these military operations are given in a very matter-of-fact way, but the drama and tension is unescapable. This is a book that is hard to put down once you pick it up, and Owen's modesty is also very apparent because he is always emphasizing the team efforts required and the accomplishments of others besides himself.<br /><br />The Bin Laden raid is described in great detail, beginning with the selection of the team, all of whom were top experienced Seal veterans, basically an \\"All-Star\\" group that was hand picked for this mission. The very extensive and exhaustive training for the Bin Laden mission is described, and then we finally come to the point where the operation is approved and they are on the helicopter and on their way to Abbottabad in Pakistan.<br /><br />I found this to be an excellent book, with very little politics or opinions expressed, mostly giving a straightforward accounting of a remarkable Navy Seal career, and it was interesting from start to finish.
B0028MBKVG|3.0|This is an overview of the historical development of super long distance running. There are no magical truths revealed or even a reasonable explanation of the famous runners. The conclusion is some people are good at running far.
B000002H97|5.0|It's Metallica where could you go wrong? Good selection of their songs. Would definitely recommend it to others. Good shipping time. Good purchase experience.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This is a first hand account of the deed. It's fairly well written and very much like every other former military guy who puts out a book after we sent him to do some impressive thing. He does a good job of painting the whole picture by explaining similar raids that lead up to this one. It's a good book and you should read it but don't expect anything unusual.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Great movie showing the start of Captain America and his heroic adventures. Would definitely recommend it to others. Good delivery time and overall purchase experience.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A trifle long-winded, and there are some truly &#34;miraculous&#34; saves, but overall well plotted, without the usual awful grammar gaffs.
B002ZG999U|5.0|One of the best action flicks ever. Good story line with good actors. Would definitely recommend it to others. Good delivery time. Good purchase experience.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|We loved the movie. Story line was good. Characters were great. Would I run out to buy? Prob not. Younger kids will prob enjoy more. Our son is 12 and only wanted to watch once.
1401923127|4.0|This is a very detailed, and sometimes too scientific, history of the discovery of the connection between mind and physical states of dis-ease in the body.  If you can work through the first half of the book, explaining how Lipton finally came to the realisation that this connection existed, then you will enjoy the second half.  Certainly worth reading if you have an interest in the origins of mind-body medicine.
B009K45Y62|5.0|The Best Edition of The Dark Knight Rises!!!! A fitting set to the masterpiece that IS THE BEST PICTURE of 2012!
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I've been obsessed with T&S for years. Since If It Was You, and this is the best album so far! Every album of T&S is better than the last. I love how they constantly experiment with sounds. Their lyrics are always so beautiful and their choruses are always so infectious. I just bought this album last night and I'm already in love with it. I've been listening to it nonstop. My favorite song on this album is a bonus track called Guilty As Charged. Amazing song. I would recommend this to anyone, especially T&S fans!
B005OJTVAW|5.0|i love how sleek & smooth this is.  it stays closed when need to be w/magnetic strap.  plus its a great color for a mom of twin girls!
B00B1OEP32|5.0|This album is AMAZING!!! My favorite by far. If you haven't bought it, you should!!! It's so raw, just Justin and a guitar.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is really really really fun also it can a challenge at times I like all the different character and the different skateboards over all its a great game
B005IQZB14|5.0|My book club read this book and really enjoyed it.  We couldn't wait to go hiking ourselves.  Just a little more informed about what it is really like after reading her story.  We laughed ourselves silly at some of her tales and afraid for her at others.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This was awesome to come home from school yesterday and see this dvd in the mail!! Delivered on time so my fiance and I watched all the other episodes that havent been on TV. Let me say to those whom havent seen all of season 3 you will be pulled right into season 4 because something very tragically unthinkable happens that will leave you shocked!!!(If you thought Mrs. Sible's passing was a shocker) As a grown man watching this i cried!! BUY IT!!!!

B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is a  sweet and entertaining holiday movie tryed to watch it on Tv but got tried of the commercials. This movie is a great chick flick. Love Jude Law in it, very cute!!  Grab your cocoa and cosy up and go for a Holiday on a cold winter's night or day...

B002NWOOXW|4.0|I would watch this movie multiple times. The casting and acting are well done along with an imaginative story line.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed the message the author shared.  He described his experience in a way that created a visual in my own mind. Toward the end of the book, I found that it became a little too technical for my taste.  I lost sight of the spiritual experience that he had written about so skillfully. Still, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it for anyone who has an interest in NDE.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It wants too many permissions, I'm not giving it permissions not required for functionality! I'm not using it, I don't need it, kindle's browser is a mobile browser, I don't need your spy!!!

0446519456|5.0|This is Brian's 3rd book (1st one is 'Many lives, Many masters). This book shows a strong integration between psychotherapy and metaphysics (a bit of a marriage). Great explanations about reincarnation. Some clients have found their own graves from past lives. This book revolves around clients 'Elizabeth' & 'Pedro' - while also exploring and explaining the topic of regressive therapy. Brian discovers we are often reincarnated over and over again with spirits/souls (people) from our past lives - sometimes switching roles of parent to/or lover (in different lives) - or we can be different genders. Lots of great lessons & sayings. Elizabeth & Pedro share overlapping stories from 100's of years ago. Brian did some self-regression himself. Too many wonderful points in this book to list here.<br />I hope you read and enjoy this book.<br />Scott MacNeil
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE  LOVE  THIS APP!! One question, how do you update it on the  kindle fire?  Thanks I REALLY REALLY want the update Thanks, Embiddy
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is much easy than temple run<br />cause you can collect more coins faster and quicker.<br />and thee gems to revive your death.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Cute but a little slow moving. Could use a little action. And at least one treat that's always free. The games in between like the weed pulling game definitely help.
B007H9B8FS|4.0|another classic garbage cd that everyone should add to their collection. Great tracks all the way thru.  Has been hammered since i first cued it
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Better than fifty shades, it's a love story that will get to you emotionally. I'm attached to this book an  excited for the finaL to come out

B004W2UBYW|4.0|It is not often that I get to read interesting biography as that of Steve Job's. There's so much about him worth emulating. I will definitely recommend this book to all my friends and family.
B0088X7YMS|3.0|The story behind this flick is decent, but the CGI could've been better.... It's not as good as the first, or third, and not even half as bad as the second. Overall, I'd have to say watch it.
B008M721MS|3.0|decent<br /> application i would deffinately recommend to others. I love the fact that in our conversation we can see eachother and hear well
B008ASLK8A|4.0|The first Sherlock Holmes was really good, and the second was not as good, but definately worth buying and watching more than once.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app!!!! I play this game all the time on my phone but I love it on my kindle fire because the screen is so big! You should definatly download this app, it is challenging but relaxing.
B004VYYA2K|4.0|Great storage for Barbie's and accessories; holds more than you'd think! Also zips down to reveal a play area with different rooms. Flexible, but sturdy. The girl I gave it to just loves it...so does her mom!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I began watching this series after hearing about it a few months ago.  After watching the first episode online, I was hooked.  If you like period drama its for you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game. best part is being able to play it with my 3 year old daughter. we play it everyday.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I must confess that I am a longtime Rankin fan and Rebus is one of my favorite characters.  It's been a long time since the last Rebus book and I'm glad that Rankin found a device to bring Inspector Rebus back from retirement.  When you are an aficionado of a series such as this, you anticipate that along the way the author will write a clunker.  Happily, Standing in Another Man's Grave isn't it!  Rebus remains a great character,  Scotland remains a great setting and Rankin remains one of the best at what he does.<br /><br />Alan H. Siegel
0307887960|3.0|The Dukan Diet is similar to the Atkins diet in that it incorporates more lean protein and fewer carbs into your daily diet.  The initial phase as described in the book is intended to shock your system by allowing pure protein & a little oat bran only, and you will experience dramatic weight loss during this 2 to 7 day period.  In the second phase you  eat protein and certain vegetables until you reach your healthful weight.  The third phase is similar to the second phase, but you introduce some carbs and cheese into your diet.  The fourth part of the program allows more choices of foods, but one day a week you are only allowed pure protein meats/foods.<br /><br />The Dukan Diet advises against counting calories but historically Weight Watchers has been known to be the most successful diet in the United States, and it has stood the test of time.  I have known women that lost forty pounds using Weight Watchers, and they looked terrific, but unfortunately, did not continue the diet as a way of life, and soon gained the weight back, and then some.<br /><br />I also know women that have dropped weight using the Atkins diet, and they can keep the weight off as long as they don't return to their normal eating routines of eating carbs.  They all gained the wight back because our body craves carbs and sugars.<br /><br />Eating too much protein is bad for your heart and bad for your kidneys, which are given the task of removing the excess purine from your body.  Too much protein will result in overtaxed kidneys, which could lead to kidney disease and ultimately kidney failure.  While losing weight will help you if you have hypertension issues, and might even eliminate hypertension all together, it's clear that hypertension and CKD are linked, so if you have hypertension, this diet may not be right for you.<br /><br />If you eat 1000 calories of chocolate cake everyday, and nothing else, you will lose weight.  Every diet is based on consuming less calories and hopefully getting your body to move more.  Muscle burns calories all the time, so creating more muscle means you will burn more calories. So being at a goal weight is essential, but one must obtain that by making lifestyle choices that are livable and right for them.  I can't support a diet that incorporates absolute rules such as \\"you must eat nothing but protein one day a week for the rest of your life.\\"  Healthy guidelines suggest eating no more than 6 ounces of protein at a time, and not even on a daily basis.<br /><br />If you want to lose weight, keep it off, and have healthy organs, you will have to change your way of life by reducing calories, eating a wide variety of foods that include fruits and vegetables with antioxidants, and exercise.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|This is an okay adventure yarn that requires the reader to dispense with reality.  But, I read it to its end and therefore must have enjoyed most of the trip.  What I found irritating was the almost constant stream of quips from the book's hero, John Corey.  Nicely placed bon mots from time to time are welcome...but these are incessant and jarring and interfere with the flow of the story.  A good read if you don't want to think.<br /><br />Alan H. Siegel
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game can seem easy, then all of a sudden a game pops up that seems impossible. I love it.
B00006690G|4.0|It shipped pretty fast and was definitely in the condition that it stated. Had some scratches and marks on the CD itself but it still plays perfectly. Overall pleased with it.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Played through multiple times and had no issues. this is a extremely fun game that everyone should play at least once
B00004T9UF|3.0|The CD didn't take that long to ship and seemed to be in good condition. However, on at least 3 of the songs it skips and is static the entire time, which obviously sucks, and is definitely not &#34;Good&#34; condition. If I wanted to return it it would end up costing me $$ for shipping and in the end wouldn't be worth the time for money on my end. Probably not going to risk the purchase next time.
B005LJKEXS|4.0|This is clearly a well designed and well constructed cable, and the workmanship is top-notch. It should work nicely for most applications that the average user would put it to. BUT, be aware, this cable will NOT work with devices that require power for more than just data transfer. An example of this would be external USB powered hard drives (e.g WD Passport), high-powered USB WiFI adapters (e.g. ALFA Cards), and similar powered USB devices requiring higher amounts of power to function. (Exception: it WILL work with external hard drives that have their own power sources. In other words, hard drive with their own plug-in power adapter.)<br /><br />It probably will not charge or power most devices such as iPhones, iPads, iPods (a lot of 'i's' I know) and the like. However, it works fine with devices requiring very little power, or no power at all, but only requiring a transmission medium for data transfer. For example, it will work fine with printers and USB flash drives. I plugged mine in to several of my USB flash drives and they all work fine with it. It also works with the printer. However, when plugging it in to my external USB powered hard drives (which contain a motor which must receive adequate power), it does not work. If in doubt, I suggest you first contact the manufacturer of the device for which you intend to use this cable.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My granddaughter received this movie for Christmas 2012.  She loves it and shares it with her friends.  Perfect gift. Very satisfied and recommend to my friends.
B0091LS07E|2.0|I chose this rating because I thought the song by Alicia Keys and sung by her was on the CD.  It is not and there is not a song that I like on it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It is a heart warming story that proves you can do anything no matter who you are and what you look like
B001BNFR6W|5.0|This is a perfect boxed set. Great design, great extras, great purchase of a great show. I love it and couldn't be happier with my purchase.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|This album is great when you listen to it from a CD but it's a totally different feeling coming out of a record player. It will blow your mind how much being a record changes an album.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you haven't seen this series, now is the time!  It has something for everyone!  Best show I've seen in a long time! Love it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is go addicting I cant stop playing it I like this 1 more the the 1st one. AWESOME!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I adored this book! It took me a few pages to get into it as I've never read the author before. The prequel was an easy read but this was much longer and she had the chance to really develop the characters. And they had deep, messy feelings that were well described to the point where I even shed a tear.  Awesome book! Can't wait to read the next in the series.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|One of the best horse games for kindle that I've come across. Worth the download! The horses actually look life like, most games are cartoonish.
B008VVT51U|5.0|Enjoyable to watch seasoned actors and actresses give a premium performance. Need more movies of this type instead of the violence and foolishness being marketed today.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love the game and the graphics, but the quality of the app on my kindle is horrendous I downloaded it once and i played it for a while and then every time i clicked the app it would begin to laod and send me back to my homepage. So i deleted the app to sort of reset and then reinstalled and at first it worked and i was relieved , but then i turn my kindle off and i turn it back on and the app won't open. I am sufficiently disappointed. I will be deleting this app again. -_-'...Tell me when you work out the kinks.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|She likes but involves a lot of help for someone almost 5 and also can't do much with the free portion.
B00A4A2N6K|3.0|I'm not a nicki fan but i like a couple of her songs. i pretty much only listen to her when im angry and it serves its purpose :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I started reading this trilogy just to see what the hype what the hype was about. I normally only like to read mystery and law books. But I ended up falling in love with all three of these books! It only took me week to read them I could not put them down. I have also recommended them to everyone I know. What a great writer I hope she comes out with new books soon.
B008KW43TE|5.0|i love frank ocean's music i think he's an amazing artist and inspirational. i delve into his song's like a good book
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've loved this show from day one and have probably watched each episode from each season ten times or more. But by far season three is my favorite. Lots more zombies, and much more action. Season three is a thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A great mix of Back to the future and Groundhogs day.  That's about as deep as a review you'll get from me.
B004FQX59I|5.0|I own over 400 DVD movies, and this one is in my top 10...easily! Oliver Stone turns the JFK assassination/Jim Garrison story into an absolutely gripping thriller! I am not a Kevin Costner fan in general, but I do enjoy his performance in this flick! And what a star-studded supporting cast! Some of the the stars' roles are pretty minor but still add to the greatness and validity of this historical film. Yes, it's a long movie, but if you're a 20th century history buff fascinated by the whole story of the Kennedy assassination investigation like I am, you will not be bored for a second throughout this film!<br /><br />Also, last night I watched this DVD on my Blu-Ray player and 42\\" HDTV. Even though the DVD is technically standard definition (I bought it two years ago, long before my HDTV), I was amazed at how sharp the picture is...it looked like HD to me! Just a great picture, quality-wise.<br /><br />The 2-disc edition features a very long featurette that details the whole story of the investigation with various interviews, footage and commentary from people who were there. It might be a little more tedious than the movie itself to watch, but still very informative. Highly recommended! Get the 2-disc edition!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My wife and i had laugh after laugh watching  pitch perfect! I halfways expected the movie to be a geeky choir flick but it had a decent storyline and some great characters. Watch it!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I bought this a couple of months back but kept ignoring it. Finally, one night, I really wanted something new so I launched this game. It was the best 3 hours I've spent in a while; I moved through it quickly, not stopping to illuminate all the glyphs or add energies to my scarf. I then replayed through completely with a total stranger who had the patience of a saint and finally went back through to complete all of the trophies. This game is serenely beautiful while the gameplay is excellent as well. While I found that Flower made me dizzy - this had none of those issues and the environment was totally immersive. No matter what genre you enjoy, this should not be overlooked. I too wish I could replay it as though I never have before - it was that enjoyable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If you like romance, you'll  Love reading this book. I couldn't put the book down. If you like Nicholas Sparks this is a must read book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this constantly in lecture to take notes, keeps me very organized and cuts down on what I have to carry
0765325950|5.0|This is a masterful conclusion to one of the very best epic fantasies of all time.<br /><br />There is not much more to say than that. If you have made it this far in the series then I have no doubt you will agree. If you have not read the series--do so.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I've never really been a fan of their music, but this album has actually won me over.  Worth the listen.

1400067820|3.0|Nissam Taleb's Antifragile reads like a random walk through his brain with ideas being flung about in every which direction with no linear development of some greater idea....but perhaps that is a feature and not a bug (as the saying goes) of the book.<br /><br />Taleb divides the world into three states of fitness: fragile, robust and anti-fragile. We can all recognize the first two: fragile, being diminished or damaged by shock, stress and volatility; Robust, being resilient. Antifragile is a term he appears to have coined to mean things that benefit from shock, stress and volatility. A good example of this is human muscle that grows and develops the more it is stressed (up to a point, of course).<br /><br />The best explanation of the concept is when he writes about the health field. Fragile situations include those where the upside is known and limited and the downside is unknown and could be limitless. His example of this is our tendency in the West to over medicate. Prescribing antibiotics for minor, non-life threatening conditions (think ear infections in kids) that the body would have very likely dealt with on its own has led to super bugs that require ever stronger antibiotics.<br /><br />Anti-fragile is characterised by a certain and limited downside with an unknown and limitless upside. His example here is when someone has a terminal illness. The downside is known - death within a year or two. In this case, it makes sense to use experimental procedures and untested drugs. The worst that could happen is that the patient could die a bit earlier than otherwise; the best would be recovery and a long and happy life.<br /><br />And now, for some criticism.<br /><br />It seemed to me that on every second or third page there was a phrase similar to \\"As we saw in Chapter X...\\" or \\"As we will see in Chapter Y...\\" I say, deal with a topic or issue once, deal with it completely and then move on.<br /><br />Taleb says that Nature is an anti-fragile system, that Naturebenefits from the random variation to which it is subjected and that this helps the biosphere to survive even massive shocks. A major point is that fragile individuals are required to die to the benefit of the community.<br /><br />This is not my view of evolution. The variability of DNA, the fact that no two individuals within a species are exactly alike, is a necessary condition to Darwinian Evolution, but it is not sufficient. Darwin's point is that more individuals are born than can possibly survive and procreate. As each individual is different, some will be endowed with traits that will make them more fit for the current environment than others. These will survive, procreate and pass on the more favourable genes to future generations.<br /><br />It is not that it is necessary for individuals to die for the system to be anti-fragile as Taleb suggests, but because of the surplus of individuals and the competition for resources, some individuals must necessarily die. This is what provides Nature with its ability to survive shocks.<br /><br />His argument about variability in restaurants leading to better eateries (i.e. the restaurant industry is anti-fragile as it benefits from variability) is similarly flawed. It is the free market in restaurants and the fact that there is, in general, a greater supply of restaurants than demand that generates good places to eat. If severe regulation increased the barriers to opening a restaurant and decreased the supply, we would end up with, to use Taleb's phrase, Soviet style cafeteria food as any old restaurant would survive.<br /><br />Taleb notes the asymmetry in airline arrival times. The variance is almost always negative: planes seldom arrive early. Well, Duh! First there are clearly no uncontrollable events that would make the airplane early, but there are mechanical breakdown, adverse weather and so on that can delay flights. Furthermore, there is no payoff for any of the controlling agents if the plane is early. \\"Early\\" is as negative as \\"late\\" for airport personnel and only potential early arrivals can be mitigated (the pilot can slow down the aircraft). As a result, flights are mostly on time and when there are not, they are much more likely to be late than early.<br /><br />Yes, Dr Taleb, I know. I am nitpicking and you hate that. But if you are trying to convince me of the elegance and veracity of your ideas, you could use better examples.<br /><br />I liked this book the least of Fooled by Randomness (my favourite) and Black Swan, but still give this one a three star as I like Taleb and believe he has important insights.

B008M721MS|5.0|This Product installed easily, quickly and with out problem.  It performs as promised. I would download app again for my kindle fire hd.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|is a good idea but I would prefer the DVD in my collection.  This was an affordable alternative to DVDs and cheaper than DirectTV and cable.  Thanks!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This was the bet. Ever. I can't wait til the  trilogy of movies are out and about. I am hopelessly hooked.
0689835604|5.0|My son can't get enough of this book. Even when he's fussy and not wanting to sit still for a book, when I pull this book out he quiets down and loves trying to lift and pull the flaps. It's a fun interactive book that I think my son will enjoy for a long time.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Fun family movie.  We liked the ability to stream it to our home on a very coled day instead of going out for a movie rental.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Interesting look into the personal and business live of an icon. Especially for one that is a computer geek it is interesting to read about how things progressed
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The two disk set allows for viewing Session 2 in full, as many times as desired.  Quality is top notch.
B000L53D4O|4.0|I got this for my granddaughter and she just loves it.  Great for small motor control activity and will be great when she starts pulling herself up to walk.  I got it for an unusually great price!!
B004HD61KE|5.0|This is the first Rollins story I've read. I love the weave of ancient civilizations, religion's history as an individual perceives it, and political conspiracy theories, both past and present. Great action with multiple small story sections tying everything together. Now I just have to decided which Rollins story will be next!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game but amazon are slow to update so I would go elsewhere it you would a version that updates :(
B0098VXBIA|5.0|This movies was good. I love how they show that not every woman's pregnancy is all roses and butterfly's. Interesting!
0345505387|2.0|I purchased this after reading the book series which I am a big fan of.  I was so excited to begin this as I am a fan of graphic novels but I was quite disappointed that this is actually NOT the Outlander story, it's only about the first third of it. If you are purchasing this thinking you will be getting the Outlander (albeit in condensed, graphic form) you are not. So really the book ended just as the story was getting underway which was not something the book description indicated on Amazon.<br /><br />As for the illustrations, I was not overly bothered by the beginning images of Claire and Jamie, however I found it very strange that throughout the book Jamie had completely different features from page to page, as if he was drawn by about 20 different people. In the author's note at the end she includes a picture of Jamie that she and the illustrator came up with together, but Jamie looks nothing like that picture at any time in the story.<br />Overall I got the feeling that the Exile was a half-hearted mashed together effort by both author and illustrator which is a pity because the story could have been such a good one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!!! I Max out my kindle fire battery while playing this game. I can't turn it off.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I love the Abba songs, singing,  and the beautiful Greek island setting. The scene where the mother is singing about her relationship with the daughter always brings tears to my eyes.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Well told story of his experience with illness made more fascinating by his medical education. I was fascinated from the first page to the end.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this application get it you will not requret it. You can get multiple versions and multiple languages. Great app.
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|people  with disabled friends or family members,should watch this fact base movie twice,even better for those with disabilities themselves..trust me for once (smile)!. people all over look and wonder,.just keeping it real.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Liked that this was a different storyline than the usual.  Well written, kept me reading.  Made me think about and look into another point of view.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just started watching this excellent series. We were able to find and record the first season but we couldn't wait to continue the series! We couldn't find Season Two anywhere. (The third and current season is in progress on regular television now.)<br />Excellent High Definition quality.<br />The use and ease of this product makes Amazon movie watching enjoyable!<br />Very happy with our purchase.
0765325950|5.0|the series was great.<br />Was a little disappointed with the ending.<br />Planning on rereading soon and maybe my opinion will change since I read it quickly.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|Reminds me of when I bought my first fixer upper house to live in. It is a movie you will want to see again and again.

B00AATV046|5.0|Going back in time when things were a lot simpler and people respected each other more. How different life was back then! Makes you want to go back in time. Truly a great Christmas classic.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|My wife got a kindle fire hd 8.9 for her birthday this is pretty much necessarry so she can search i guess
B000HT3PPG|5.0|There aren't many movies that can mix up a cute codger with a long white beard, an adorable little girl, a striving single mother, an evil embittered soul-shriveled ideologue, and a New York Christmas parade without causing most people over 6 to get a sugar high but this film does it and even manages to come across in spots as a serious drama.  Go figure.  If you haven't ever watched it - do.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like it more challenging hope there is another one that's as much better than this one as this one is to the first one
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I love it! Stands nicley and when u close it your kindle goes to sleep and it wakes up when u open it, its great.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great for end of day relaxation tool to calm down and to also keep the little one off my nerves for a few minutes
B0017IKR7K|5.0|Paisley's albums are fantastic, but this one is probably my favorite. So many great songs: Ticks, Online, Letter To Me, I'm Still A guy, Waitin' on a Woman, Oh Love. They are all great. If you like country, you'll like this album.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I just switched from OneNote to Evermore for two reasons.<br /><br />1. OneNote doesn't read text from images well at all. I can actually take a picture of my hand written notes in my moleskine and search for the words I wrote in Evermore!<br /><br />2. OneNote doesn't play well with any other apps! Evernote works with everything! I mean everything! handwriting apps, browsers, everything!<br /><br />I only gave a 4 star because I have trouble editing notes that have pictures in them in this app. other than that, I have had no issues.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I have zero complaint with the content of this book - it's a classic, and fun to read in the summertime. The kindle version has some odd formatting choices where breaks in the narration are given whole page breaks in the way a new chapter would in a standard format book. A cosmetic critique, to be sure, but I found it a minor if persistent annoyance.
B008CP6RWU|1.0|The actual package was pristine and the packaging was good. The game itself is terrible. I beat it in 4 hours. There's no dialogue at all, no enemies, (except for a giant flying scarf-eating monster) and the only actions you can do are walk, glide, (limited) and activate ribbons to set them free. The whole game you see a vast mountain in the distance. A large white &#34;person&#34; is next to you and you can tell from the cutscene that you're supposed to go to the mountain. So you start in the desert, travel many miles and eventually get to the mountain. Once you get there you die and your spirit flies from the mountain. It travels backwards through EVERYTHING you just did and then you land in the desert. That's it. Game Over. The other two games suck as well because to control it you physically have to move the controller like a wii remote. Are the analog sticks there for nothing? Plus they're confusing and pointless. It wouldn't have been so much of a waste if Journey was a game by itself but since there were other games in it, I wasted $30 instead of $5. Definitely a bad case of buyers remorse. But hey, if you stll want to buy this than go ahead. It's not worth the time or money though.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The plot was.... Was there a plot? It was predictable. The characters were one-dimensional. The writing was simplistic and cliche.
B003Y8YXGM|4.0|1974's WALLS AND BRIDGES is John Lennon's fourth solo album (not counting SOME TIME IN NEW YORK CITY, which he shared with Yoko Ono). It is the immediate follow-up to MIND GAMES, rolled out the previous year, and the second in the trio of albums worked on during the Lennons' eighteen-month seperation, concluding with the cover compilation album ROCK 'N' ROLL, which followed in 1975. The waves of John's \\"Lost Weekend\\" from Yoko reverberate through the songs of WALLS AND BRIDGES.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Going Down on Love,\\" a thinly-veiled reference to the seperation, elevated by its smooth percussion beat. \\"Whatever Gets You Thru the Night\\" is a rocking radio hit (featuring harmony vocals by Elton John). \\"Old Dirt Road\\" is a serene third track, an ideal song to accompany driving. \\"What You Got\\" is a repetitive rock tune; catchy, but the song could have been much better if there were a little more to it. \\"Bless You\\" is a decent, relaxed lounge-style song, one which can be skipped over with little regret. \\"Scared\\" is a slower rock jam, one which falls just short of takeoff speed. \\"#9 Dream,\\" a song inspired by that Twilight Zone between sleep and consciousness, is a great pop song with a celestial, dreamlike groove. \\"Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox)\\" is a good pop/rock song probably written about May Pang, Lennon's companion during the seperation. \\"Steel and Glass\\" sounds too much like \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" on the earlier IMAGINE album to hold much interest; another skippable song. \\"Beef Jerky,\\" while worth noting because it's an instrumental (uncommon for Lennon), it is another disposible track. The album's climax, \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)\\" is a melancholy and poignant rock ballad about lonliness. A joking, one-minute cover of \\"Ya Ya\\" closes the album. The song wouldn't receive its legitimate due until ROCK 'N' ROLL.<br /><br />While far better than SOME TIME IN NEW YORK CITY, WALLS AND BRIDGES is more hit-or-miss than MIND GAMESand can't escape feeling like a mixed bag. It has some good songs, a handful of average ones, but nothing outright bad. \\"Nobody Loves You\\" is the album's masterstroke, but in the end, even it isn't enough to completely salvage one of Lennon's good, but flawed efforts. Though it's a mistake for Lennon fans to overlook the album, WALLS AND BRIDGES still fails to meet, let alone surpass IMAGINE or PLASTIC ONO BAND.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Never heard about these books or the author but boy I am glad I came accross this - made me think of the Hunger games!
B003Y8YXGC|4.0|MIND GAMES is John Lennon's 1973 solo album, released the year after the disappointing SOME TIME IN NEW YORK CITY. This one returns to exclusively John Lennon songs, without any shared space with Yoko Ono. In fact, MIND GAMES is the first of a trio of albums released during John's 18-month seperation from Yoko (aka the \\"Lost Weekend\\"), a period which also emcompasses 1974's WALLS AND BRIDGES and the album of oldie rock covers ROCK 'N' ROLL, which was worked on during the seperation but not released until afterward in 1975.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"Mind Games,\\" a great Lennon track advocating peace and love. While it doesn't escape the shadow of the superior song \\"Imagine,\\" what could? \\"Tight A$\\" is a light, upbeat ditty with a country rock twang. \\"Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)\\" is an apology letter to Yoko set to music. Not bad, just nothing special. \\"One Day (At a Time)\\" is a decent pop song with prominent backing vocals. \\"Bring on the Lucie (Freeda Peeple)\\" is a rousing rocker with a political edge. The \\"Nutopian International Anthem,\\" while meaningful for the Lennons, was for me a throwaway four seconds of silence. \\"Intuition\\" is another moderately enjoyable pop song. \\"Out The Blue\\" is another appeal to Yoko, one of the album's better songs. \\"Only People\\" is another okay tune with a semi-political message. \\"I Know (I Know)\\" is a good song, once again with roots in country. \\"You Are Here\\" is a mellow little pop song with a tropical groove. \\"Meat City\\" ends the album on an energized note, but is still nothing remarkable.<br /><br />When I played MIND GAMES for the first time, I was immediately impressed by the title track, but the rest of the album left me waiting for the next really memorable song...which never arrived. It took several listens for the album to grow on me, but even so, it remains on the lower half of Lennon's solo albums. With that in mind, MIND GAMES earns a marginal four stars from me. If three-and-a-half stars were possible, that would be amore accurate score. Think of MIND GAMES as the wannabe younger brother of 1971's IMAGINE. A Lennon effort not without its merits, but nowhere near the height of his first two  albums.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|loved the book more than the movie - it is one of those classics that you can read over and over again!
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|Ryan O'neal played his part excellently, a product of Stanley kubrick.  The acting throughout was super and the<br />diversity O'neal played good.

B003ES61EE|1.0|The Amazon Basics Lens Pen and The Nikon or Lenspen Brand are Basically the same but Amazons is missing the Cleaning Agent making it almost useless without it, unless you can find a Carbon powder refill to put in the cap of their pen, Buy the real thing you wont be disappointed!!! I am not knocking Amazons products there Lens pen is the only Amazon branded item that fell short of being a fully functional item. I had a second Amazon pen sent to me thinking it was a mistake in manufacturing but both were empty the sponge for the powder was in the cap but no powder. So after 2 of Amazons I Purchased a LensPen NLP-1 it's worth the few extra $$ if your hands don't get black touching the tip under the cap it's just a tiny chamois cloth that can't remove fingerprints.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|finished the book in a record 3 days - didnt put it down. well written. simple story line, but held well together. nice read
