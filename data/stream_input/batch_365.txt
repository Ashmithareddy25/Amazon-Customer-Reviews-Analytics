B0000CDLA7|5.0|Thank god it is not another boring &quot;concept&quot; piece.  This album is great.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I bought this title on vinyl when released in 1970.  Thought it pretty much sucked for 2 reasons:  (1) Back then we had no context as to the goal of the band, that it was an &quot;unplugged&quot; sort of project, a live-in-the-studio recording.  The expectations at the time were that we were all looking for another Sgt. Pepper, or a least another Abbey Road.  This isn't either, but once you listen to it without those expectations, the results are pretty damned good.  (2) Even on my first listening to the original, I thought the production was a mess.  &quot;A Long Winding Road&quot; was the most pretentious boring thing I had ever heard, and &quot;Across The Universe&quot; was just unlistenable.<br />Fast forward 33 years, and this release fixes those problems.  The production is very clean, you can feel yourself in the room with 4 guys (or 5, counting Preston) jamming, having fun.  No more BS strings on &quot;Winding Road&quot;, and that song has parts in it now that Specter completely removed.  &quot;Universe&quot; has been cleaned up before (on &quot;Past Masters&quot;) but the Specter-less versions here make them, along with title track, best cuts on the CD.  &quot;Winding Road&quot; (as we also heard on the &quot;Anthology&quot; series) is a great little song, now that the strings are gone and you can feel the emotion in Paul's voice, which Specter edited out.  2nd CD, Fly on the Wall, is of interest only to diehards, but I found it fascinating just to hear them chatter amongst themselves.<br />Only complaint is that I miss John thanking everyone at the conclusion of &quot;Get Back&quot;.  Otherwise, love the job they did on this album.
B000002U82|5.0|This album falls somewhere between the Beatles &quot;Sgt. Peppers&quot; and the Doors &quot;LA Woman&quot; on my list of the top 10 albums of all time. It spent an amazing 700 weeks in the charts. Dark Side is one of the finest concept albums of all times, and as a whole, it transcends its individual songs, which are by themselves very good. The core concept is the tightrope between sanity and insanity. It starts with a simple, insistent heart beat and a sound snippet,<br />&quot;I've always been mad, I know I've been mad. They have to explain why you're mad.&quot;<br />From there to the end of the album, every sound echos. The bass, synthesizers and drums create a universe of sound. Nothing is solid. David Gilmore's guitar resounds with paranoia and the impossibility of reaching sanity, fighting to keep its clarity and identity in the overwhelming universe of sound created by the rest of the band.<br />A solo saxophone breaks in, clawing for light. The music is interrupted by uncomfortable, frightened, small, lonely, internal voices which echo fear,<br />&quot;I am not frightened of dying. Any time will do. Why be frightened of dying? I see no reason for it.&quot;<br />Sound effects of cash registers, money, frightened running feet, and gasping, rushed, out of oxygen breathing intersperse the album. Finally, the album concludes with a simple, insistent heart beat and a last thought,<br />&quot;There is no dark side of the moon, really. Matter of fact, it's all dark.&quot;<br />This is an album designed to be listened to through headphones so you can be completely enveloped by its vision.  If you have an SACD player, I highly recommend the SACD/CD hybred version because it surrounds you much like headphones.  If you don't have an SACD player, this is one of the best reasons to buy one!
B000053NYB|3.0|TO the people who cant get enough of biting rubin<BR>First off, this movie was not supposded to be a factual account, it was supposed to make money in hollywood. And if that means twisting some facts then so be it.  This  is the reason why the Hurricane received 3 stars, it wasnt ALL facts although it first off- wasnt supposed to be and second off there wasnt as many lies in it as some say there was.........<br />But u idiots who ACTUALLY THINK RUBIN COMMITTED THE CRIMES are not just stupid but should be slapped and told to think twice. U idiots who actually believed fact for fact the disgusting [...]  site are dumb beyond belief. U rejects.......... That stupid site claimed the jury had 2 blacks in it. WRONG. it HAD a black jamaican in it then he was coincidently ( cough), voted off by the all white jury. And thefact u say rubin failed the lie detector test iz as dum as u people are. HE PASSED IT FOLKS. Just think, if the rubin is a clearcut criminal/liar/thug as much as u think he is, why tha hell would he have websites dedicated to him, movies on him, books(which unlike the movie have the facts, which actually STATE rubins actual prison records and the fact HE WAS no1 contender) Rubin DID lose the last fights he fought, though HE STILL WAS the no1 contender, all of u hataz are jus word fo word repeating the travesty of bullcrap wrote on that &quot;website&quot; i Hope rubin payz no attention to u jackasses, n REAL people apprecitate the fact that RUbin fought for so long and got his credit. What pisses me off most is that u actually think u KONW that rubin iz guilty. a trial which proceded for 20 odd years, n u retards think u KNOW the all tha court documents and facts. Go get ur facts straight and stop reading racist sites and publishing on other respected ones as these......<BR>congratz to denzel fo his fantastic performance, although we all knew he wood, he always doez
B00005UW9T|5.0|I have loved this movie since it came out. It tells the story of the last of the Russian princesses- Anastasia. The story goes with the thoery that Anastasia survived after the rest of the royal family was murdered. In the movie- she has been at an orphanage since she was 8 and remembers nothing of the past years of her &quot;former&quot; life. She &quot;gangs up&quot; with Vlad &amp; Dimitri- 2 conartists who want the reward that her grandmother- the only other surviving Romanov- is offering. The antagonist/ &quot;bad guy&quot; of the movie is Rasputin- who sold his soul to get revenge on the Romanovs for turning their backs on him. He is furious that Anastasia survived and.... well... I guess you'll just have to buy it to see!
B00005OAIE|5.0|For those of you who haven't heard of John Mayer, you must be living under a rock! This Cd is one that has continously made its way back into my cd player after months and months of owning it. Not only does John Mayer have an incredible voice, he also plays guitar in his songs. There is not a single song on this cd that I dont like!! My all time favorites are My Stupid Mouth, St. Patrick's Day, Why Georgia Why, and '83. If you like good music, and ACTUAL singing, then get this cd. Also, if you are a John Mayer fan already, check out Maroon 5, another great band destined for stardom.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Also have a defective Alien Director's Cut, behaves the same way as described by an earlier reviewer.  <br />Otherwise, this DVD set is for the true fan!!  Fantastic!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I've been a Zep fan since the late-Seventies, but I was too young to have seen them live. Since John Bonham's death in 1980, I had become a major Zeppelin fan. However, rare collectibles and bootlegs have, more or less, eluded me.<br />So, it was with great anticipation that I tore off the wrapping on my copy of this DVD. I put in the first disc, which features a famous Royal Albert Hall show, and I put the package away so I would not see the song list. I wanted to experience the Royal Albert Hall show as if I was in the audience.<br />My pulse was pounding as we see the band walk on stage and immediately explode into &quot;We're Gonna Groove.&quot; I was ecstatic! I was seeing Led Zeppelin like I always wanted to see them: Energized, and eager to play. And man, do they ever play.<br />It's a concert like none we see today. No props, no flashpots, and no special lighting effects. Just a band, plugged into amplifiers, and playing their hearts out on stage.<br />I was in heaven. This was not just another concert DVD. . . This was like watching a dream. I had imagined what it was like to see Zeppelin prior to 1973, and with this disc, I not only get to see them play, but it's a mesmerizing show.<br />I finished the first disc nearly exhausted with excitement, and having to wipe away a tear or two from joy. It's a feeling I will probably never have again, but it's one I wanted to share with you because if you are either old enough to have listened to Led Zeppelin before Bonzo's death or you are simply a fan of their music, this DVD is the most crucial part of a Zep fan's official collection.<br />You have to understand that, aside from the decidedly mediocre and indulgent concert film, &quot;The Song Remains the Same,&quot; most Zep fans today have never seen them like this. Now, thanks to Jimmy Page, we are able to see Led Zeppelin as they were in virtually every part of their career. It is an excellent document of their career as a band, and I recommend it highly.<br />If you don't get chills watching Robert Plant belt out early Zep songs in the Royal Albert Hall show, you were probably never really a Zeppelin fan to begin with.<br />Furthermore, several reviews here are critical of the pre-digital era recordings. I think that it is absolutely LAUGHABLE to criticize this disc for having less than 21st Century digital quality. Does anyone whine about the &quot;less-than-stellar&quot; recordings made by Louis Armstrong in the Twenties, or do jazz fans clap their hands in sheer bliss that they can sit and enjoy the the fact that they can actually hear Satchmo play? The fact that we can see Zeppelin kick ass on stage is well worth the ridiculously low price offered on this website.<br />Can the audio here compare to the best discs available? No. Does that matter? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Look at what you are getting: There has not been an official video document of a Led Zeppelin concert, aside from &quot;The Song Remains the Same,&quot; for nearly THIRTY YEARS! Fans who did not have access to bootlegs never heard &quot;Earl's Court '75,&quot; or &quot;Knebworth '79.&quot;<br />This disc affords true fans, who never saw the band live, the opportunity to see Zeppelin at their best. I am a fan of their music, and after I finished watching the disc, I commented to a friend that I would have paid $250 for access to this footage.<br />That's what this disc means to me. It's almost priceless material, and we get it for less than one ticket to ANY current rock concert being held today. That says something.<br />I hope you get the same level of enjoyment out of it as I did, because if you do, you are in for one hell of a good time./>If you don't get chills watching Robert Plant belt out early Zep songs in the Royal Albert Hall show, you were probably never really a Zeppelin fan to begin with. <br />Furthermore, several reviews here are critical of the pre-digital era recordings.

B00000DC10|5.0|this album foretold the future of punk rock, and that future was too much for most people to accept.  get it while you can because refused is no more.  great stuff.

B00005RHGK|2.0|Jeepers creepers is basically a ripoff of many other horror movies from the 70's-80's era, mainly stealing ideas from the texas chainsaw massacre.The movie did have some good gore and makeup, along with a few good scenes, but the main problem with this movie is that it's nothing we haven't seen before. Also, the movie can become slow and boring at times. If you want to see a much better horror movie in the same vein as jeepers creepers, check out wrong turn instead.<BR>Rated R for Strong violence/gore, Language, and brief nudity
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I actually didn't have much faith in this CD, but being the avid music fan that I am, I decided to give it a try.  The music on the CD isn't that bad.  Britney co-wrote 8 out of the 12 new songs (song 13 is just a remix of me against the music), and they are an improvement from &quot;Dear Diary&quot; off the Opps album.  The only real weakness on the album is &quot;The Touch of My Hand&quot;, the candidness of the song is hard to swallow, but the other songs make up for it.  The best song on the album is &quot;Early Mornin'&quot; with it's fun beat and hypnotic chorus.
B00006ADFL|5.0|For those who wondered how the director of &quot;Bad Taste&quot; and &quot;Brain Dead&quot; got to direct &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; this 1994 film from director Peter Jackson supplies the answer.  In 1954 two teenage girls brutally murdered one of the their mothers in what must be the most sensational murder in New Zealand history.  &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; tells the strange story of these two girls and their unique relationship.  If you think this is just a reality based splatter flick, then you are going to be much more than surprised and impressed by what Jackson has accomplished.<br />Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) is a simple and rather dull young girl who is totally dazzled when Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) enters her life.  Juliet is impressed as well, because Pauline has a scar on her leg from an operation.  Juliet declares that: &quot;All the best people have had chest and bone disease! It's all frightfully romantic!&quot;  Eventually both the romance and the frightfullness of it all reaches a tragic conclusion.  In their all consuming friendship Juliet and Pauline create a &quot;Fourth World,&quot; better than heaven (because it has no Christians), inhabited by the clay figures they have fashioned to represents their friends and where the music of Mario Lanza, the greatest tenor on earth, is always in the air.<br />Jackson brings this fantasy world alive, which allows him to explore the pivotal theme of juxtaposition throughout the film.  This comes into play most notably at the beginning and ending of &quot;Heavenly Clouds.&quot;  Jackson begins with a 1950s newsreel about Christchurch, New Zealand, which is interrupted by the appearance of the two screaming and bloodied girls, thereby symbolizing the way this sensational case shocked the nation.  Even more effective is the film's conclusion, where the murder is inter-cut with what the girls think will happen if they do not find this way of saving themselves.<br />With any film based on historical events there are omissions, alterations, substitutions, and the like, and &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; is no different.  On the plus side of the ledger Jackson attempted an almost morbid verisimilitude.  Almost all of the locations used for filming were the real locations where events occurred, including the tea shop where Honora Parker ate her last meal, which was torn down a few days after the shooting ended.  However, the cast and crew found the actual murder scene uncomfortable and moved further down the path.  All of the journal voice-overs come directly from Pauline's diary, as are the characters in the girls' make-believe world.  However, since the two filled up fifteen notebooks and hundreds of letters devoted to their fantasies, the movie actually underplays these elements.<br />However, having familiarized myself somewhat with the actual &quot;facts&quot; of the case, and the recollections of the woman one of the girls grew up to be, the key point of dispute is the motive.  But if Jackson is guilty of becoming fixated on the idea that these two young girl committed a murder because they could not bear to be separated and have their fantasy world unravel, then he can be hardly faulted for finding that a fascinating interpretation of the evidence (the girls never testified or were examined in court, but Pauline's diary was seen as providing all the answers).  More importantly, Jackson does not seem guilty of taking liberties, merely with offering a valid interpretation of the evidence.  For example, the murder sequence greatly reduces the number of blows, but the effect is still horrific, so it seems trivial to complain about any inaccuracy.<br />From an artistic standpoint his interpretation is more than justified, especially at the end.  In addition to the information we receive between the final scene and the closing credits that tells what happened to Pauline and Juliet, Marzio Lanza sings &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone,&quot; which is as perfect a choice of a song to play at the end of a film as you will ever hear, forcefully underscoring the film's thesis.  Jackson says this is &quot;a murder story about love, a murder story with no villains,&quot; and it is hard to argue with this idea after watching his film.<br />&quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; received an Oscar nomination for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Jackson and Frances Walsh.  The film won every award for which it was nominated in the New Zealand Film and TV Awards, including Best Actress for Lynskey and Best Foreign Performer for Winslet (both of whom were perfectly suited for those roles), and earned film festival awards in Venice and Toronto.  This is a striking and unforgettable film, both creative and thoughtful.  Those who are drawn to it because it was directed by Peter Jackson might be shocked by the subject matter, but they will not be disappointed with the results.erfect a choice of a song to play at the end of a film as you will ever hear, forcefully underscoring the film's thesis.

B00006RCSR|5.0|This is an excellent adaptation of the traditional Cinderella fairy tale.  It features a much stronger personality for Cinderella who doesn't just sit back and take the abuse like the character from the fairy tale.  <BR>Very clever introducing the Grimm brothers in the beginning.  Overall a wonderful story that even my boyfriend enjoyed despite his initial protest!
B00005JMFO|5.0|Fabulous movie that only the British can make! Just as good if not better than Four Weddings and a Funeral. It made me laugh and cry at the same time. I loved the opening scene and voice over from Hugh Grant - it really did make me stop and think, especially with so much terror and hate being generated around the world. The acting was classic British, very good and Hugh Grant as Prime Minster was a fantastic casting choice. You really do want to see this movie, especially if you need or want to refocus on the important things in life!
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I loved Pink's Missundaztood and was afraid that any album to follow would either not be as good (as so commonly happens in the recording industry after a hit album) or would suffer under my own comparisons.  However, Try This is every bit as awesome!  It is a different album with a different flavor but all Pink. Save My Life is hauntingly beautiful - I woke up singing it in my head the first night I listened to it.  Hooker is hilarious - and makes me wonder who it might be about (Christina?  Britney?  Or at least I hope it's about one of them!). If you are a Pink fan, you will not be disappointed with this latest effort.  She definitely meets and exceeds the challenge.  Each album stands strongly on its own.
B00008S2VG|3.0|an okay album, but the album sounds just like her MUSIC cd : electronica, vocal special effects, drum machines, etc.<br />it's almost kinda boring, and her voice always leaves something to be desired (she doesn't sound so great singing live or a cappella).   the songs seems rather repetitive or formulaic, no big surprises.<br />The videos are even lamer, and i've grown rather tired of her work actually. i don't think she can beat the ray of light album, although music was a pretty cool listen, as well.  once she hit electronica, it seems like she's done everything she can think of.  i'd like to see her pen all her own songs on her next album, as well as do the instrumentals (she sings and has learned piano, and she used to be a drummer way back in the day), so come on madonna....show us what you got in the way of music, cuz we've seen all your performing.  <br />the rapping in american life is really pathetic...i was embarrassed for her in that song...and the lyrics?  i'm waiting for her to grow up as far as lyrics go, instead of talking about having already done so much of it. i've really liked her work and performances since 1986, quite a long time, but i've had enough of gap commercials, makeup ads, etc.  madonna, you're rich enough...just relax and enjoy life for awhile, or is that not possible for her unless everyone's eyes are on her?
B00000295Y|5.0|Ahh, yes.  The good ol' days when rap was interesting and had some creative skills behind it instead of a bunch of over-hyped rappers bragging about how rich they are or how many cars they have.  Cypress Hill's \\"Black Sunday\\" is a classic rap album with some great songs, great beats, and most of all, catchy lyrics that had a nice flow to them.  They sure don't make anymore gems like these anymore... or it's very hard to come by one in the game of rap these days.<br />While following the \\"gangster rap\\" format, this album isn't as vulgar or as offensive as most rap albums.  Don't get the wrong idea and think that these guys are \\"squeaky-clean\\" or anything like that.  They have their fair share of profanities and violent/drug references.  What I mean is that the album's a lot more milder than most rap albums, but while it is milder it has a better structure to it than most.  The songs are very gun/drug oriented, but the songs do a great job of flowing and appealing to those who don't find the two topics all that interesting.  In other words, you don't have to be a druggie or a gun fanatic to enjoy these tunes.<br />This is an excellent album with some great songs.  My favorites are \\"I ain't goin' out like that,\\" \\"insane in the brain,\\" \\"when the (explicit) goes down,\\" \\"lick a shot,\\" \\"what go around come around, kid,\\" \\"hand on the glock,\\" and \\"break 'em off some.\\"  While I enjoy the entire album, those are my favorite songs.  The album has a very high replay value and never feels outdated.<br />\\"Black Sunday\\" is able to achieve what many of the new rap albums of today fail to do.  It's a great listen with songs that are simply about more than bragging about \\"bling-bling\\" or that type of nonsense.  If you're not a big fan of rap, then chances are you may not take a liking to Cypress Hill.  If you're like me and have been disappointed with many of the new rap acts, then pick up \\"Black Sunday\\" and take a trip down memory lane.
B00005JKJA|5.0|\\"Mulholland Drive\\" is a remarkable movie in roughly every way possible.  I was impressed when I first saw the movie, but after a couple more viewing, I truly began to appreciate what Lynch has created.  I love David Lynch for both his good and his bad films, mostly because he won't compromise.  I have yet to see him make a mainstream movie in a bid for cash.  \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is another one of his many bizarre and semi-coherent movies, and this time, it's a really, really good one.<br />The plot centers on the relationship between two women, Rita, who has amnesia after an attempt on her life, and Betty, who came to Hollywood bright eyed and bushy tailed to be a star.  The pair spend a good chunk of the movie playing detective and sneaking around Nancy Drew style in order to try to uncover Rita's identity.  About 3/4 through the movie, that entire approach is scrapped, and the rest of the movie is a lot of seemingly random scenes and actions.  I'll deal with the plot later on in greater detail.<br />The acting is fabulous, especially Naomi Watts, going from bubbly pert blonde starlett to emotionally unstable and possessive green-eyed monster (in the Shakespearean sense, not literally).  The rest of the cast holds up their ends of the bargain with skill as well, with not a poor performance in the cast.<br />The music and sound are phenomenal.  Lynch is a director who truly understands the subtle nuances of sound in a movie, and he uses that understanding to weild a mastery over this movie's soundtrack that is crucial to the movie itself.  The standout in the sound category (coupled with visuals) is the amazing scene in the \\"Silencio,\\" a bizarre theater that the women visit.  The scene marks the point where the movie truly stops making sense in the traditional fashion, but it also marks the point where Lynch expertly and poetically works our emotions.  The climax of the Silencio scene (I won't give any details, because it's so amazing) never fails to move me in a waythat I have rarely experienced before.  I am filled with an overpowering sense of hopelessness and impotence every time the singer . . . well, you know.  This is due in no small part to the absolutely gorgeous rendition of \\"Crying\\" that the audience is treated to in this scene.  Couples with the surreal visuals, this scene alone is worth the ticket price.<br />Now on to the direction.  In case you haven't noticed by now, I love what Lynch does with this film.  He effectively combines scenes of comedy, horror, surrealism, drama, sex, and poetry into a single knockout punch of a product.  He knows subtlety, and is more subtle in this particular film than most people realize.<br />I'll now go back to the plot.  There are two ways to view this film.  The first is as the cinematic manifestation of a bizarre and incomprehensible nightmare that affects you in many ways, but you can't figure out why.  It could very well be \\"that really weird dream you had last night\\" in cinematic form.  You could also try to find the puzzle and solution in the movie, and there are possibilities.  If you don't want to spoil the movie, skip to the conclusion now.  If you think of the first 3/4 of the movie as Diane's fantasy and dream of her relationship with Camilla, it starts to take shape.  This is not to say that the first 3/4 are a dream, that's far too simple.  Diane (who is the real character, along with Camilla, Betty and Rita are made up) is driven insane with jealousy and rage by the structure of Hollywood and her lost love with Camilla.  Notice how many objects and characters in the last 1/4 of the movie make appearances earlier in her fantasy.  Most of the characters are recognizable, but just passing through are \\"Aunt Ruth,\\" \\"The Cowboy,\\" and \\"Camilla\\".  Perhaps Diane created this fantasy to convince herself that she was a good person who did not just pay for the hit on her lover.  So what about the key and the box?  There is no rational explanation for the key and the box.  Allwe know is that the key was on the table indicating that Camilla was now dead (check the dialogue later with the hitman).  The most obvious (and most probable) interpretation is that it's Pandora's Box.  Notice that the movie makes it's final turn down the path of darkness when the box is opened.  When the box is opened, the illusion is shattered.  \\"It is all a recording.\\"<br />I wait with baded breath for Lynch's next film.  I hope he keeps making stuff like this and \\"Blue Velvet\\".
B0000C6E4D|5.0|It really bothers me how people are saying the cd is not good at all. I will fully admit that Afterglow is not as good as her previous album but it's still a very good cd. The cd is great but it is about the lyrics not the beats. My generation cannot get past the beat and just listen to the lyrics.  Buy the cd, it's good lyrically but if you want good beats or catchy tunes, go check out the billboard hot 100.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|i liked this album a lot, but it doesnt look like DT, I mean:<BR>when u listen to the other albums you feel like: wow this pice of music is awesome! n u think that only DT could have made something like that... so other albums r unic<BR>this one is like metallica in mid 90´s, which isnt actually bad for overall music, but it is a real deception coming from DT<br />I love DT 4 2 things : their skillz, n their creativness   <BR>in this album they just show their skillzbut they dont make something REALLY new, like it happened with SFAM<br />buy this if u like DT n dont expect to much
B00006CXXU|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CD. CHRISTINA GOES DEEP WITH HER LYRICS AND VOICE CAPABILITY. THIS CD IS DEFINETLY WORTH BUYING. HER FIRST CD WAS VERY CHILDISH AND SHE WASN'T ABLE TO REALLY SHOW OFF HER TALENT BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T REALLY WRITE ANY OF THE SONGS. I NEVER LOST FAITH IN HER THOUGH. STRIPPED IS DEFINTELY AN ADULT CD, NOT AS FAR AS THE CONTENT I MEAN THE MATURITY OF IT. THIS GIRL IS SOOOO TALENTED. I LOVE THE CD EVERY LAST SONG.MY FAVORTITES ARE :WALK AWAY, IMPOSSIBLE, I'M OKAY, LOVING ME FOR ME,FIGHTER, AND UNDERAPPRECIATED.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|This is a very good movie with a lot of twists. The way it goes backwards throught the whole movie was cool. It wasn't a thing like I had expected. It kind of remineded me of Jeopardy, because they gave the answer at the beginning. The thing that amazed me the most was how you can actually go through your whole life only remembering anything before a certain period of time. Like the last thing you remember is seeing your wife die. I would go crazy. I think after years go by, this movie will be said as one of the best in the genre.<br />This is a very good movie with a lot of twists. The way it goes backwards throught the whole movie was cool.

I think after years go by, this movie will be said as one of the best in the genre.<br />Woops I couldn't remember if I typed my review or not.
B000099T2L|4.0|I LIKE BEYONCE, ALTHOUGH HER VOICE ISN'T ONE THAT I CAN LISTEN TO FOR TOO LONG. EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN PREFERENCE. I LIKE THE CD. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT. WHEN I FIRST BROUGHT IT I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT, BUT THE MORE I LISTENED TO IT THE MORE I STARTED ENJOYING IT. SHE HAS A VERY UNIQUE VOICE THAT IS HARD TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO BUT SHE IS TALENTED. HER LYRICS ARE HOT. MY FAVS ARE :&quot;THAT'S HOW YOU LIKE IT, THE SONG TO HER FATHER, YES,THE CLOSER I GET, ME, MYSELF AND I, SPEECHLESS.
B0000VCZK2|2.0|I received the first copy of this on December 8th, and observed the packaging was poor, very flimsy and the plastic trays which were not fastened to the underlying cardboard well were already working their way loose or had popped off completely.  I loaded disk one and sat down prepared to be impressed by this latest incarnation of this collection of films and selected the DTS version of the 2003 version of Alien.  On the first chapter in the scene at the table during the heated argument about the change in course of the ship to intercept the Alien ship beacon, the DVD locked-up.  I did a fast forward and it locked up again later in the next chapter.  I had Amazon.com send me another copy, this time 4 plastic trays had already worked their way loose, and fell on the floor immediately after I removed the shrink wrap.  I loaded the first disk again and selected the DTS version of the 2003 version of Alien, same issue, same chapter same scene, this disk keeps locking up.  <br />Mind you I have the industry acclaimed Denon 2900 player ($1,000.00 list) which has performed flawlessly on the hundreds of movies; not one issue ever.  Couple that with the fact that I have now gone through 2 copies with identical flaws has lead me to conclude that this set is not worth it.  There is clearly a technical issue at least with the first disk, coupled with the fact that the packaging is cheap junk.  Avoid this boxed set until each movie is released separately from what I have read that will be in 01/2004.
B000002NFM|5.0|I usually only get into techno when I want to dance, but this cd is an exception. I listen to it just whenever I'm not in the mood for rock or classical music. All the songs are excellent first rate techno, irresistable beats and addicting rythms. The best cut off the album would have to be the first song, I love how it slowly builds up at the beginning and then its all a mix of beats, synthesizer and some nice feminine cooing. All in all, if you want some good beats but despise rap and its retarded bullcrap then this is a great cd for you.
B00005JMFR|4.0|I honestly have to admit: I don't understand what all the critical panning of THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS is about.  I'll concede that the first hour almost plays like a \\"Last time we last saw Neo\\" introduction, and the Wachowskis might've gone back to the drawing board to \\"revolutionize\\" a stronger opening.  However, at the time of working on the picture(s), perhaps they didn't have a clear-cut breaking point between the two storylines, and, thus, the opening of REVOLUTIONS suffers from too much exposition.  Some of it is has the feel of a manufactured recap, hinting that reshoots might've been performed after they agreed on the two films' midpoint.<br />Still, once the action begins, the action begins, and the non-stop blow-out (and blow-ups!) are technically as sophisticated as anything revealed in the first MATRIX film.  While not quite capturing lightning in a bottle the way they did with the first outing, the Wachowskis manage to pull out all of the stops to give serious 'Matrixiles' a grand send-off to this slightly uneven trilogy.<br />The theology slant was, in my humble opinion, an obvious set-up to the conclusion.  When fanboys and fangals everywhere were expecting the probable \\"ship in a bottle\\" virtual reality tie-up (myself included, to a point), the Wachowskis managed to veer off toward the \\"other\\" logical plotline to tie up the loose ends.  Little did we know that, at the end of the stellar first film, we were actually being shown an allegory for Christ's struggle on behalf on mankind.  Sure, the foundation was there, but it played out winningly through REVOLUTIONS.<br />If REVOLUTIONS has any great strength, then it would have to be creating a hunger to go back and rewatch the first and second installments for hints, clues, and foreshadowing that will inevitably appear on subsequent viewings.  While that isn't the kind of brick to build a franchise around, it certainly didn't hurt this cyber-driven action trilogy.
0385504209|5.0|I recently finished the DaVinci Code. It is incredible! It is so incredible how forshadowing with small, seemingly insignificant details, become the key to figuring out the code. Everything is intertwined. I was awake one night untill 1 in the morning, because I was so enthralled. I have talked to friends ranging in age from 13 on up; all raved endlessly about The DaVinci Code. If you can read any book, spend you money on this one!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Angel or Buffy, but Firefly hooked me from the first episode. The story and characters sort of remind me of early Robert Heinlein novels with cool gadgets, exciting action, and great characters. Of all TV series I've ever watched, Firefly is my favorite, which makes it so sad that it was cancelled by Fox. I'm praying that sales of this DVD will take off and the series will be revived by Fox or another network such as SciFi. <BR>   This 4-disc set is just about perfect. The picture quality is pristine with anamorphic widescreen transfers. Several of the episodes have commentaries with cast or crew, and disc 4 has some featurettes that fans of Firefly are sure to enjoy.<BR>   If you have any interest in the show at all, you won't regret buying this box set. Someone please revive this show!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Possibly one of the most original alternative films I've seen in the past years, Donnie Darko is a powerful mind stimulator.<BR>A brilliant deep-cutting script combined with intimidating acting and careful directing is what you get here but the more thoughtful viewers will also be awarded with valuable and out of the mainstream questions.<BR>A young teen diagnosed with bordeline schizophrenia starts having weird meetings with a human size rabbit who looks part alien, part reptile, part artificial, and who carries a message of doom for Donnie Darko (the boy, and yes, that's his name)..Donnie begins to take the message very seriously but simoultaneously he begins paying attention to the world around him and in him. He understands with the help of his &quot;friend&quot; that nothing you see and observe is accidental.<br />Predictably, he comes at odds with the people he tries to convey this message to (&quot;the world will end in 28 days&quot;), he discovers that most people out there live on the surface of reality and not only they wouldnt dare take a dive underneath but wouldnt even consider there's something constantly eluding their awareness. Probably because their awareness is, hmm, defective?<br />Donnie Darko, inspired by his visions ( or his deeper glimpse of reality) begins a personal trek of questioning, redifining and re-interpeting. The strange &quot;Grandma of Death&quot; (an old woman who years ago had written a book about time travel and spends her time ever since waiting for a &quot;message&quot; herself) becomes a focal point for Donnie. But Donnie tries also to squeeze as much information about the puzzle of reality from other people around him, most notably certain teachers, he attempts to piece things together and bond all these realities that appear before his eyes and mind together.<br />The film is, as others have noted too, incredibly hard to classify. Viewers with a particular liking in the &quot;alternative&quot; will adore it as it encompasses loads of hints and direct references not only to time travel, but to parallel universes, telepathy and astral projection to mention but a few. But if the &quot;paranormal&quot; spooks you it has strong dosages of the &quot;normal&quot; reality most people experience too even if that is portrayed as a dull and depressing one. Which is yet another asset of the movie: it is as frank and honest as it gets.<br />The young actor who plays Donnie Darko is utterly convincing allthough he has his show stolen by his mother who adds the necessary down-to-earthness to it all with her refreshing performance. But there is no actor involved in this film who goes unnoticed and I'd have to think hard to find a parallel in that respect.<BR>Lastly, this is an emotional rollercoaster of a film, it goes from scary to sad to funny and thought provoking to intimidating and back to melancholy in an stunningly effortless way (kudos to the script writer).<br />An absolute must-see.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I've been reading the books once a year for the last 30+ years. It's a beloved classic and I never thought it could be translated into a movie, though I loved the idea. My first viewing of The Two Towers gave me a bit of a 'turn' - I had a couple of surreal moments - when Aragorn went over the cliff. How could I have been reading these books for all these years and missed THAT!?? The answer that flashed back was easy - it never happened - okaaay - the first movie was wonderful - trust Peter and let it slide. One of my favorite passages in the second book was Sam and Frodo's time in Ithilien and I was waiting to see Faramir, and there he was and ....Who the Hell IS that!?  I was a bit miffed at the change in my favorite Ithilien ranger Faramir's character. However on the way to the car I realized that I understood why the changes were made. This extended DVD seems to flesh out the changes and I think that if I had seen this extended version first the changes would not have been so distracting, though I enjoyed the theatrical version, once I got over the changes. The movie still captured the flavor of Tolkeins work. This is a wonderful version of the Two Towers and I would recommend watching the movie with the director and writers commentary after viewing the 'original', particularly if you don't understand the changes (even if you do - it validates your understanding). It does give you a deeper/better insight into why the changes had to happen. <br />My only complaint is that my DVD player doesn't play the 2 appendices discs, and no one can tell me why. My Zenith DVD is new and plays DVD, CDr, CDRW and MP3s, though it's coded as region 1. It seems odd that I can view the first 2 discs and not the 3rd and 4th. (I had them back to the store where I bought the DVD's and all the discs play on the store's set up)I did not purchase the Two Towers through Amazon as I did the first and will do for the 3rd, so I'm not sure if there would be the same problem. If anyone has anyhelpful information regarding this I would be very grateful. It's so frustrating not to be able to view them. For me seeing the creative efforts that went into the making of these films is a wonderful experience.
B00005JLKN|4.0|...and the Hannibal saga goes on. The third installment of this trilogy had a few surprises up its sleeve: notably, the incredible cast, secondly that it's a very worthy continuation of the other two (a lot of people were expecting it to fail dramatically). <BR>This time around it's Lecter back to his coaching methods again as he directs an FBI agent (Edward Norton) to find the &quot;tooth fairy&quot; killer (Ralph Fiennes).<BR>The new elements in this film compared to its predecessors are that it contains more fear, more intimidation, and less dosages of dark humor. All these work in a positive way: they are not overblown out of proportion, in fact the film is superbly balanced throughout.<BR>And, speaking of balance, the biggest trick is balancing big time actors like Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes and of course Hopkins himself. Indeed, it's not Hopkins that dominates the proceedings here (even though it's impossible to even think of ignoring his presence) but Fiennes portraying the psychoting serial killer that the &quot;doctor&quot; is helping to track down. Fiennes gives a memorable (and tone setting) performance in one of his very best roles of his career.<BR>Fiennes's performance helps shift the focus point from Lecter in an overwhemling way. Aided by Norton's subtle but ultra-convincing acting the whole film becomes a classic not only for fans of the Hannibal trilogy but for fans of the genre in general. Keitel is great in his rather small role and it goes without saying that Hopkins maintains his reputation as one of the all-time classic cinematic psychos.<BR>The script is very well-crafted and maintains the suspense and the &quot;edginess&quot; from beginning to end, but what really does the trick are the dark optics that accompany it particularly the sequences involving Fiennes and his horrifying deeds.<BR>As it has been mentioned already &quot;Red Dragon&quot; can be viewed either as a sequel to &quot;Hannibal&quot; or a prequel to the previous two parts. But even if viewed as a sequel it's actually incredible when you think that it could've been a disaster especially because of the hype prevailing the other two films before it. It's far from that, it's simply a great film.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is one of the best cd I have ever got, each song is vary good and there is not one bad song on the disc.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I'm not a country music fan, and was given this cd as a gift because of the cover of NIN's Hurt.  This is some of the most honest, heartfelt music I've ever heard.  From the opening track with it's recitations from the book of revelations, Cash takes us down the dark road to his personal judgement day, allowing brief entries of light to wash in through weary cathedral windows, before closing with the chanting voices of &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot;.  This CD is grim, oilstained, and firmly rooted in a reality where all the inevitabilities have been exposed.  Every song here hits you in the guts and twists.  If you don't find chills creeping up your spine by track 3, and your throat choking up with sorrow, you may already be dead.  Buy this album, you won't be sorry.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|I saw this film last year while studying in Paris and it is incredible! I saw about 80 foreign films last year and this one is by far the best. If you have ever studied abroad before, this is a movie you HAVE to see. It completely captures the experience, and is absolutley HILARIOUS. <BR>I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD since May!
0385504209|5.0|This book was very intriguing and exciting to read.  A page turner that does not disappoint.
B000089RVX|4.0|After seing the horrible flop, at least for fanboys and seekers of a true plot, that was Daredevil, I specifically noted the song Bring Me To Life in it's pulse-pounding soundtrack. I had delayed a few weeks, afraid of the other songs on this seemingly mediocre album, but I was very surprised. <br />All of the songs are good in their own way, and the haunting piano melodies seem to amplify Amy's voice. The most notable songs, which there are many of, are Tourniquet, Going Under, Imaginary and the seriously noteworthy My Immortal, which is very calm for it's quite dark lyrics. Though it may not seem fitting, the composition in it is quite amazing. <br />While this album is great, we all know how far a little thing called audio editing can go. Evanescence absolutely sucks in concert. I am not kidding. If you have this album, don't think about going to a concert. <br />Peace Out, <BR>NW
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|In my opinion, this is what rock n roll is. None of that rap/rock, bullcrap, just solid easy going rock n roll. The Strokes are by far one of the best bands on tv, well, one of the best bands period. They did a great follow up with this album. IF you wanna buy it, but not sure of how good any of the songs are, I strongly suggest you listen to &quot;Reptilia&quot;.
B00005JLWN|4.0|This time is the not-so-distant future, after a third world war. The place is a city called Librium. The status quo is that all persons are no longer allowed to feel emotions, the reasoning is to prevent their dark emotional desires to fight and cause another world war. To supress their emotions, all persons must take a regular dose of Prozium (opiate?) which causes emotional vacancy. Also all forms of music and art, and anything which conjurs human emotion are illegal. Christian Bale plays Johnathan Preston, aka &quot;Cleric&quot;, whose job is to uphold the law and find &quot;sense-offenders.&quot; Along the way he begins to think he can feel emotions again, and he eventually stops taking his Prozium. Soon he begins to work against the status quo and tries to help the underground &quot;sense-offenders&quot;. The plot in this movie is nothing too original, but it is a valuable metaphor. What is outstanding in this movie, is the action and fight scenes. The gun battles are excellently done and well choreographed, there is also enough action to satsify an old-school John Woo (Hard Boiled, Killer) fan! Christian Bales performance is also outstanding, if you are a fan of his (he's the new Batman!) this movie is worth a watch. The rest of the casting is also pretty good, except I don't really agree with using Taye Diggs as the emotionless, new partner of the Cleric. Overall this movie is well-done and not too well-known, so if you haven't seen it and you are an action, sci-fi, or any other type of movie fan, I highly recommend it.
B0000DIXRU|2.0|Let me start off by saying that this album is by no means better than Anathema's previous effort &quot;A Fine Day To Exit&quot;. That album had a lot of memorable songs, was very coherent as a whole and also featured great lyrics. Their latest release however isn't at all up to standard I reckon; it has only two really good songs, some others are fairly good and the rest is either filler material or plain weak. This record is a lot more synth-oriented, which isn't a bad thing per sé, however it turned out to be creative disaster (hence the title?). Especially the lyrics were a serious let down to me. If you listen to tracks like &quot;Temporary Peace&quot; from their previous CD or &quot;Angelica&quot; from &quot;Eternity&quot; you'll know what I mean. Furthermore, on occasion the vocal parts now actually ruin certain songs, something I hadn't ever thought possible with Anathema as the vocals and lyrics had always been one of the strongest parts of their music.<br />Ratings per song:<BR>1) Harmonium: A reasonably good opener, in the vein of their last record.<BR>2) Balance: This is fairly good and also reminiscent of their AFDTO release, nothing groundbreaking though.<BR>3) Closer: I think this track is no good. Some sampled vocal trick repeated endlessly. Yes the song is real catchy and bareable, but it's not atmospheric in the way I appreciate it and lyricwise it's just dreadful and seems to be so out of place with the Anathema catalogue.<BR>4) Are you There?: This is one of the two excellent songs. Give this a listen. Hauntingly beautiful.<BR>5) Childhood Dream: Not bad, but really, this is filler material. A real shame, especially since there are only ten tracks here and the running time isn't that long either.<BR>6) Pulled Under At 2000 Meters A Second: This song is easily the heaviest on the album. That doesn't mean it's any good. In fact, it's the worst on the album (tied with Closer). Good Metal tracks by Anathema can be found on Eternity, Alternative 4 andJudgement, not on &quot;A Natural Disaster&quot;.<BR>7) A Natural Disaster: I really love female vocals, but the title track to this album didn't impress me at all. I find it rather annoying even.<BR>8) Flying: Here the vocal parts &amp; lyrics mostly ruin the song. Another let down.<BR>9) Electricity: This is the second (and also the last) great song on the record. Great melody, beautiful emotional vocal parts, and some excellent instrumentalism. Lyrics are decent, not great, yet meaningful to some I'm sure.<BR>10) Violence: A moderately OK instrumental. This one grew on me somewhat after a while. It's rather long though...<br />All in all I cannot give this more than 2 stars. If you're a long-time Anathema listener and haven't gotten this yet, I would strongly advise you to listen to it first before deciding if you want to purchase it.
0064471837|4.0|Garth Nix drew me into this strange new world and made me a part of it.  The magnificent characters and witty commentary were captivating. I couldn't but the book down. I recommend this to any teenager who loves to read and explore new worlds.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I have ever bought. I would recommend it to anyone. I love every song on this CD. I also like Linkin Parks other CDs, but so far this is the best one. <br />Money very worth spending. Go get one - you will not be disappointed. It's funny too because I've never heard of them till recently when this CD came out and a friend let me listen to it. I was instantly hooked.
B000002L3P|5.0|This CD is absolutely the closest to my heart.  If you are a blues lover, this CD will rock you world.  &quot;While We Cry&quot; is a masterpiece that will leave you in tears but never leave your soul.<br />But beware new Kenny fans...Noah Hunt is NOT the singer on this album, however, Freight and Jimmy are still in the band.<br />If you are thinking of getting this CD expecting Blue on Black you will be dissapointed - this is a true blues album.

B00005JMFO|1.0|This movie is perverted!  I had such high expectations, since the cast consisted of some of my favorite actors and actresses.  The movie was about cheating on spouses, pre-marital relations, and other totally inappropriate behavior.  Anyone who thought that was love has got some serious problems.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is a very good cd.If you are looking for a cd with great instumentals,and talented vocals, I strongly suggest you buy this album.Interpol is often cpompared to Joy Division, I see it a little bit, exept they are better.

Christina is totally my idol and because of her i worked up the courage to go to a studio and start singing myself! the song on her CD cant hold us down, is a awesome song first my friend showed me that song and i couldn't stop listening to it! i keep it on repeat every night! and her song voice within is my ultimate favorite song i can't get over how perfect that song is! at first i thought it would be boring untill i heard the course! that is the song i am doing for my demo then there giving me a song the do and there sending it to HOT 103! this whole CD is the best CD ever i used to be in all rap but now that i've heard her voice how it has such perfection! i changed from rap to christina! but this CD IS AWESOME and i totally advise you to buy it it is unbelievable
B000001IQH|5.0|Passionate gutter poetry. <br />On this 1995 session, Rancid had a mission and a message. Rancid was still hungry. Their subsequent releases lacked the focus and inspiration that sustained \\"...And Out Come The Wolves\\" and 1994's \\"Let's Go\\".  Success distanced them from first-hand experience of their major themes: poverty and injustice.  In addition, celebrity afforded the members of the group too much distance from each other. When the group struggled, they had no choice but to be tight-knit and that came across in Rancid's music. Now these so-called anarchists play with the likes of Pink and give props to Good Charlotte. As time went on, Lars Fredrikson's \\"English\\" accent became so pronounced, even Madonna found him affected. My advice to Lars: get a dialect coach or date Renee Zellwegger. And Tim, poor Tim, married his own Mona Lisa - in other words, Tim Armstrong in goth drag. Next time, Tim, marry someone who wants to be with you, not someone who wants to BE YOU. You're better off without her.<br />I'm only this hard on Rancid out of love. I know the heights they can reach. <br />Maybe, I should accept that they had their time, and should thank them for the two masterpieces they've given the world, but the punk in me says F**K THAT!
0380973464|4.0|This book is a very entertaining read.  It does and excellent job bridging the two timelines of the story together, giving a good overall picture of the (relative) recent history of cryptography.  It is not nearly as sci-fi as some of his other books, and the character development is good enough to make you want to know what happens to them.
B00005OWEG|1.0|maybe i'm just too stupid to understand it, but this movie is even more boring than About Schmidt is. i mean, it shows horrors of the war but not much more. not even worth reviewing. the only good thing is, i didn't buy the dvd i rented it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|When I first read your review if was rather put off by your attacks on the practice of writing uninformative reviews. After all it is just an online review forum and your essay seemed to forget that. However, after completely reading your review, I have decided that you have possibly written the most awesome review ever. I bestow mad props upon thee.
0684859106|5.0|I purchased my copy of this book from the bakery on a trip to New York.  My family is from the south and I was intrigued by the idea of the book and the bakery. I have not been disappointed.  The recipes are clearly written and easy to follow and each one I have tried has turned out beautifully. I have made many of the cheesecakes and cookies, the pies, and cakes/frostings and they seem to be fail proof. I am  giving the book out as gifts due to the many requests for the recipes. I think it is a great book.
B00006HBUB|1.0|Ok, I wanna start saying I'm a HUGE Scooby Doo fan, I simply love all the movies and cartoons avaiable, they are really funny and interesting. With that thought, I have all the reasons to tell you the truth about this horrible cash-in movie: IF YOU REALLY ARE A SCOOBY DOO FAN AND REALLY LIKE YOUR CHILDRENS, DO EVERYTHING THAT'S POSSIBLE TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!! IT'S A DISGRACE, IT SIMPLY RUINS WITH SCOOBY DOO'S GOOD NAME! Freddie seems like Johnny Bravo, Daphne is a frightened young child who wants to prove something for people, Velma are a dumb, and one scene, Scooby (the first character that are 99% good) and Shaggy (the second character that are 99% good) are competing who farts harder. Worst: there are not a single funny joke in the whole movie (except the end, that reminds me \\"Scooby Doo on Zombie Island\\"), the story is a disgrace, far from the interesting misteries Scooby and the guys always solved on the cartoons. And to disgrace even more: Scrappy Doo are the main bad guy!!! WHAT'S THIS?? IT ONLY CAN BE A VERY BAD JOKE! THAT'S NOT THE SCOOBY DOO'S REALITY, IT'S ALL WRONG!!! IF SCOOBY DO HAVE STARTED LIKE COMIC BOOK, IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED PROFANATION FOR THEIR FANS!! IF MY GRADE ARE RIGHT? NO! IT'S -5 STARS, OR WEAKER. Geez, how can awful things being so difficult to forget! That's what I want, to forget this junk forever. Now they are trying to disgrace the Scooby Doo's name a second time, so I wanna give my previous advice for people: DON'T GO TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH SCOOBY DOO 2, FORGET ABOUT, IF YOU RESPECT THE SCOOBY'S LEGACY! WAIT WHEN, REAL ARTISTS, WHO CARES ABOUT THE RIGHT THINGS, GET A GOOD STORY AND MAKE A DECENT SCOOBY DOO MOVIE, NOT THIS TRASH. At least, this movie is useful for just three things:<br />1) To illustrate perfectly what NOT to do in a future Scooby Doo adaptation;<br />2) To show how NOT TO DO an adaptation of a TV cartoon, or any other adaptation;<br />3) To reinforce the idea that Scooby Doo are a FAMILY'S CARTOON and it have to remain like this, without this tragic and scatologic adaptation for disturbed teens.<br />Ps.: Now it's the time that people starts give me negative votes about my review. Go ahead, I don't care about that! It only proves how blind people are these days. I made my part, to warn you, but if you want to continue lying to yourself, c'mon, and give me a negative vote! The worst blind is the one who refuses to see!ve to remain like this, without this tragic and scatologic adaptation for disturbed teens.<br />Ps.: Now it's the time that people starts give me negative votes about my review.

B000005JHP|5.0|Never For Ever followed the sweet and mellow Lionheart.  This time around, Kate Bush's entry into weird sounds and vocals is in the making.  And this album came out in 1980.  Pretty progressive and avant-garde-ish.  This tops Lionheart and The Kick Inside in its sheer innovation of strange sounds, vocals that reach a manic frenzy, and some sobering songs on social issues.<br />&quot;Babooshka&quot; tells the story of a woman who tests her husband's fidelity by writing him anonymous letters, disguising herself as a younger her, and seeing if he'll go through with an adulterous affair with his own wife.  The piano is struck forcefully during the verses, before the electric guitar riffs kick in the prechorus and chorus.  And what's with the glass-shattering special effect towards the end?<br />&quot;Blow AwayEis a showcase for Kate's voice, which has her singing about a man too obsessed with music.  She wonders where the music he plays goes.  &quot;Surely not with his soul?&quot;she surmises.<br />The slow but brisk piano number, &quot;All We Ever Look For,&quot; sporting an accompanying whistle, is another highlight here.  Weird stuff:  in the second verse, there's a cookie monster sounding growl that comes in every fourth beat.  Another open door is what &quot;all we ever look for,&quot; where one might find &quot;the truth,&quot; &quot;a little hug,&quot; &quot;our own tomb,&quot; and other things.  There are some sound effects that come in when someone walks down the hall and opens doors in search of that something.<br />&quot;Egypt&quot; is of someone falling in love with the ambience of Egypt, be it the shifting sands, the pyramids, and the Nile.  The rhythmic melody is like a ship that keeps time with the beater, and towards the end, a weird cacophony of multiple voices comes in.<br />&quot;The Wedding ListEis a bit of a shocker, as it tells of a pair of newlyweds, where a &quot;mystery man&quot;shoots the groom in a passion crime.  Kate's lyrics are a bit on the bloody and violent side, speaking of swooning in warm maroon, and &quot;I'm gonna fill your head with lead.&quot; In the final lines, we find out why the groom was killed.<br />The frenzied guitar rocker &quot;Violin&quot; is the closest to punk rock Kate will ever come to.  Her voice swoops up to a lunatic pitch when she sings &quot;Filling me up WITH shivers.&quot;  And her voice soars to a weird pitch and manic madness.  Even today, I can still think of people going, &quot;What is this?  It's so weird!&quot;<br />&quot;The Infant Kiss&quot; is a bit of a controversy, as it details a Lolita-like obsession, only the genders are switched and the younger party is a little boy, the older party being an adult woman.<br />The soft melodic guitar &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; featuring a group of male backing singers in the chorus, including an accompanying male voice.  The repeated refrain &quot;B.F.P.O.&quot;is a reference to the British Forces Post Office.  This tells the lack of opportunity and assets of a now-dead and mourned for army recruit.  &quot;What could he do-should've been a rock star/but he didn't have the money for a guitar/what could he do-should've been a politician/but he never had a proper education/what should he do-should've been a father/but he never made it till his twenties/what a waste of army dreamers.&quot;<br />The brooding and haunting piano number &quot;Breathing&quot;, a chilling anti-nuclear single, is sung from the POV of a baby still in the womb, affected by the radiation her mother is inhaling following an atomic bomb explosion.  The baby knows it's dangerous to take in the fallout, but her instincts tell her to keep &quot;breathing my mother in/breathing my beloved in/breathing her nicotine/breathing the fallout in out in out in...&quot;  After a casual and authoritative report of a nuclear test, the music rises to a crescendo, climaxing with a heavy guitar and poignant refrain: &quot;What are we going to do?/We are all going to die.&quot;  One of Kate's best ever songs.

B00005QW5X|5.0|Wow, what a great and unique find!  If you enjoy off-beat, wacky movies with a scathingly hillarious sense of humor, and [mostly] excellent original music, get this DVD.  Camp to the max!  One of very few movies that I have enjoyed watching several times.  Some of those tunes are hard to forget. Oh yeah, you need an open mind to enjoy...
B00005OAIE|3.0|Ok, I'm really not into the whole popstar ideal thing, but when I heard John's singles on the radio, I took a step back and stared.  He really is in a category all by himself.  While sometimes the sugar-coated lyrics he drools out to females (like me) can get a little old and a little too sweet for my tastebuds, he's not the walking definition of the genre we so blatantly call pop.  His maturity is expressed when he's not belting out tunes (with a monstrous smooth voice) about a girl he's head over heels with.  My Stupid Mouth is probably one of my favorites mostly because it expresses awkward social behavior.  My absolute favorite is St. Patrick's Day because it's romantic while being sarcastic about how our years are planned around the holidays and their meanings.  While not a must for every record collection, a good album with a lot of soul.
B000001EC1|4.0|It is just so hard to imagine the megastars we've recieved in this industry that came from New Jersey. We have recieved Whitney Houston, the legendary Bruce Springsteen, and a working class group that truly has arisen to the top, Bon Jovi. The guys who group up in New Jersey have still proven that after all these years in this industry, they still have the touch. Although many people don't find them as definitive as Manufactured Britney Spears, it is so hard to believe that Jon, Richie, and all the rest of the members are still slated as a incredible force in the industry. The music is still giving a hunger to all kinds of fans.<br />Cross Road is a collection of their biggest songs from their original golden era in the mainstream from 1980's to the mid 90's. Their power ballad blend dtill id captured very beautifully here. The songs are all still rolling out there with great ease, including Lay Your Hands On Me, Wanted Dead Or Alive, Bad Medicine, and a whole list of others. The songs may seem like a guilty pleasure right now, but the music still makes a whole lot of noise. The package also includes the only song Jon did as a solo act at that time, Blaze Of Glory,which was nominated for an Oscar in the early 90's, as well as the power ballad, Always.<br />Although none of the songs from their recent period are on this record, it still won't make a difference in what Bon Jovi has made in this industry. I just have to say that this is truly one of the top Greatest Hits collections of all time, and I hope many more and a better one is issued down the road. They just can't stop their train ever.
B00003CXB4|5.0|With almost every word memorized, this movie still has the power to move me.  Disney really did it right when they made The Lion King!  The story can easily be related to in everyday life.  I enjoyed everything about this movie.  The character personalities, along with the music, along with the beautiful animation...everything! :)

B000063V8T|5.0|I am a busy man so I cannot spend the time writting a full fledged review, however the fact that the Star Trek TNG DVDs are in Full Screen mode is a huge bonus in itself.  I was afraid of having to stare at the two huge bars while trying to enjoy this wonderful series, however that was not the case and I do not plan on spending $4,000+ dollars on an HDTV widescreen. <br />Season 5 contained some of the best episodes, and the first day I received this collection I have watched all DVDs nonstop, and I rushed ordered the 1 day delivery of Season 3 so I could keep enjoying the wonderful world of Star Trek TNG
6304602901|5.0|A new mayor, forces the local police academy to open its doors to all. Naturally a variety of people show up, for training. There's Mahoney, a guy given the option of jail or the police academy, Jones the human sound effects machine, Barbara, the film developer, Hightower, a florist, etc. The Commisioner has Capt Harris, try to force the undeserable people out of the academy. Typical 80's comedy, is enjoyable and funny, and holds up after many viewings. The DVD version of the movie, looks good and sounds good, but there aren't to many extras.
0763617105|2.0|The beautiful artwork in this book doesn't mask a storyline that is way too upsetting for a young child. From the perspective of a 3-year old, mama owl disappears on page 1 and doesn't return until the last page. The pages inbetween show 3 gorgeously drawn little birds in the throes of anxiety over the loss of their mama. As an adult, I found it unsettling as well. Too bad the talented artist got hooked up with a hold-over author from Grimm's Fairy Tales.
B00005JMFR|3.0|The Matrix Revolutions<br />How many of you Matrix lovers were at the theaters the day this third installment was released? Many, many, many people were gladly waiting for the 9:00am showing, this much I'm positive of. I was so intrigued by the first film, which is without a doubt the greatest sci-fi/acion/epic of all time. The second film, I still have a lot of doubts about. The third still makes me wonder. I can't honestly tell you if I love it or hate it. But there was no way I was going to miss it. The second was all really a missed oppertunity. They build characters like The Architect and the two---what do you call 'em? Ghosts? What happens in the third? They decided to abort on the \\"Ghost\\" characters, put two minutes of dialouge with The Architect and drop the characters? Give me a break! They should've worried a little more with story-telling, rather than \\"unduplicatable special effects\\" (words from the W. Bros. mouths). The first film was just so amazing that a second and third seemed too good to be true---and it is---or was. I don't know how they pitched the idea to Warner Brothers and somehow come out with this kind of budgit---wait, yes I can. The same way crap like Bad Boys II, Men in Black II and Dumb and Dumberer get made. The fans are dumb enough to flock to the theaters to see it. I guess after seeing the last two films, I'm just dying to throw the blame wherever I can place it. Such a tragedy.
B0000542D2|1.0|The movie itself is worth 5 stars - at least as far as Rock 'n' Roll movies are concerned. This is a classic rock film. However, this particular (Mirimax/Alliance Atlantis) version presents the picture in an incorrectly framed aspect ratio which chops off words on signs (such as the \\"We\\" in the sign that says \\"We Buy Anything\\" that Ringo sees during his \\"This Boy\\" sequence) and people's heads (check out the end of the \\"This Boy\\" sequence when ringo leaves the boy and a close up crops the frame to below his eyes!) <br />There is no way on earth that this aspect ratio is what director Richard Lester intended. Why would he shoot the film with well framed shots (as seen in earlier editions) but want it to be released in the poorly cropped, claustrophobic style of this dvd? He wouldn't. I love widescreen but only when a movie is meant to be widescreen! The original intended aspect ratio is always the desired format. <br />Using frame captures I took from both this DVD and the 1995 MPI Special Edition VHS release (I have several versions in laser disc and VHS but this is the version that crops the least from the original film negative), I discovered about 1/6th of the top and bottom of the frame has been cropped and a barely noticeable 1/14th restored to the sides. If you don't believe me and have the 1995 MPI video tape, compare them side by side. I wish a campaign to offer free replacements for these misframed discs had been started (such as the successful campaign for the misframed widescreen Back To The Future set). There is no shot in the full frame VHS that shows microphone booms or 'junk footage' so it is definitely far closer to the proper aspect ratio than this DVD.<br />Also, the audio is just the original monophonic soundtrack processed to simulate (sort of) 5.1 stereo. The great MPI release had crisp, true stereo versions of all the songs (except for \\"She Loves You\\" of course, as the original stereo master was destroyed). <br />Wish I hadn't wasted my money onthis version - what a disappointment. I will never watch this dvd again. Whenever I want to enjoy A Hard Day's Night, I pop in the 1995 MPI VHS.<br />P.S. The cardboard case the discs are in is cheaply made too...and my disc one has a crack starting to run through it from the middle, as well as a pocket of air inside the middle of the disc which most likely will eventually render the disc unplayable. This probably started because the discs are held too tightly by the plastic holders inside the case, thus you really have to yank on them to get them out.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I struggle to come up with an accurate description of YOSHIMI BATTLES THE PINK ROBOTS. It is the most interesting album I've heard in years; beautiful, melodic, though provoking, occasionally funky, and light years ahead of the rest of the pack. Over the past few years only Wilco's YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT comes close to the sonic effect of this record. From the opening robot announcement (&quot;The test begins...NOW&quot;) to the closing sighs as the interstellar balloon touches ground in &quot;Utopia Planitia,&quot; YOSHIMI BATTLES THE PINK ROBOTS is like nothing you've ever heard before; it is mind altering in the very best connotation of the phrase.<br />The real world optimism and thematic scope of late 60s concept albums, the far-thrown experimentalism of mid-career Pink Floyd, the delicacy and patience of the best Neil Young, the cosmic trippiness of Frank Zappa, the melodic traditionalism of the finest McCartney, and some of the coolest rhythm-based Bass guitar playing you'll ever hear, all on one record. It's way cool, intelligent and just great, great music.<br />The day YOSHIMI BATTLES THE PINK ROBOTS showed up in my mailbox I worked 15 straight hours putting my newspaper to bed. Going home that night I drove around for an extra 30 minutes, just so I could listen to this record all the way through. I didn't want it to end.<br />I never want it to end. It is, without any doubt, the best record of the last year; one of the three or four best--along with YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT and Aimee Mann's BACHELOR NO. 2--of the past decade, and an overlooked classic of the Rock era. <br />Five stars doesn't even begin to cover it.
0553213105|5.0|I have never read another book that kept my attention as constantly as Pride and Prejudice.  The novel involves such a vast array of diverse characters all involved in the search for love, whether willingly or unwillingly. Mrs. Bennet's incessant stress of finding a husband for her five daughters is quite a difficult feat.  Not only does she want them to have a man for the rest of their lives, but he must be one with much opulence. The need for an attraction between the couple is quite peripheral in the eyes of Mrs. Bennet. However, Elizabeth Bennet, the second-oldest daughter, would rather renounce the popular tradition of marrying solely for wealth. She searches for true love and happiness, and wealth is an added bonus. A very unexpected set of circumstances causes Elizabeth to question Mr. Darcy's love.  As their lives continue, Elizabeth reconsiders her initial judgements of Mr. Darcy and other characters. Jane Austen's satirical and ironic comments and situations give the reader great insight into the customs of the early nineteenth century. Austen presents a very tangled web of people and events. The transformation and reactions of the characters from beginning to end is very drastic and presents very sagacious lessons about life.  This is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed at anytime.  I cannot wait to read it a second time!
B00004R997|3.0|This rather cute collection of four Disney cartoons are kinda interconnected with a travelogue of South America that is very dated by today's standards, but entertaining nevertheless.<br />The best of the four cartoons is &quot;El Gaucho Goofy&quot;.  Previously unavailable on DVD, &quot;Gaucho Goofy&quot; is Goofy at his all time best.  Watch the bit with the bolas - simply hilarious.<br />The next best is &quot;Pedro&quot;.  The story of the little airplane that could (think &quot;The Little Engine That Could&quot; with wings) is very good at telling a story - and you almost believe for a moment that Pedro didn't get through the Andes.<br />Next best is &quot;Lake Titicaca&quot;.  This hilarious romp with Donald Duck fighting a reluctant Llama (could this be the inspiration for &quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot;?) will leave most anyone laughing.<br />Finally, there's &quot;Aquarela do Brasil&quot; - probably closest to the material that links the four stories and introducing the great Jose Carioca.<br />It's kind of a mystery to me why Disney considers this mixture of animation with live-action to be a &quot;canon&quot; movie.  It's simply a collection of four Disney cartoons joined together with a live-action look at travelling in parts of South America.<br />The supplementary material, about Disney artists travelling in South America is a nice addition to the material on this disc, and also helps explain that this material is presented as a courtesy to the Office of Inter-American Affairs.<br />The interconnecting material that tries to tie together these four Disney cartoons is sadly dated, and is live-action and not animation.  It also does not do near as good a job at tying together the various cartoons as &quot;Three Caballeros&quot; would later do.<br />An entertaining look at what movie theaters used to do - provide news, travel info, and cartoons together and all for a dime.  But not recommended for anything but Disney purists.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I used to only buy John Williams CD's but this one is really worth spending the money on. The music is very riveting and very emotional from beginning to end. Highly recommended!
B00005RDSM|4.0|So you want to try to never grow old.  You could pick no better movie to try with than Disney's Peter Pan.<br />The story parallels Barrie's unforgettable novel almost perfectly.  Wendy tells stories of Peter to her younger brothers.  Peter hears these stories from outside Wendy's window and decides to take her to Neverland with him so that she can share her stories with his &quot;Lost Boys&quot;.<br />With one of the strongest songs in the Disney library, &quot;You Can Fly&quot; to Neverland and watch the rest of Peter's adventures with Wendy.<br />Captain Hook is one of the most memorable Disney villains ever, especially with the croc chasing him almost every time you see him.  Tinkerbell eventually becomes one of the most seen of all Disney characters.  And the portrayal of Peter Pan is dead on to the original material - he really is &quot;the boy who never grew up&quot;.<br />The many extras packed into this single DVD, including a sing along (=without= &quot;You Can Fly&quot;?  Horrors!), the usual &quot;making of&quot; featurette, and some wonderful commentary by Roy Disney and many of the original animators, make this disc almost a must buy for Disney fans.<br />Highly recommended for any family with children.  Highly recommended for any collection of animation greats - almost irreplaceable in a library of Disney classics.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|bar none the best sci-fi to come around in a very long time.theres not enough stars on your scale to rate this show.its a real shame that the so call experts at fox could not see the show for what it was,a great show.a real jem in a time when television has hit a all time low.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Many artist come out with a lot of hype as to their talent.  Few, however, can follow that initial hype.  Alicia Keys is one of the few actually can follow the hype, and get better.  This new album &quot;DIARY&quot; is excellent.  &quot;Karma&quot;  is a good be careful what you do song.  Excellent if you are feeling paricularly unkind toward someone.  &quot;If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By&quot; has a classic feel, as does the lead single &quot;You Don't Know My Name.&quot;  (However, Alicia, I could have done without all the talking in the song.)  I also really enjoy the &quot;So Simple&quot; and &quot;When You Really Love Someone&quot; tracks.  &quot;So Simple&quot; has an unusual vocal, for someone who can actually sing, and &quot;When You REally Love Someone&quot; is just a beautiful track, in the mood of &quot;Woman's Worth.&quot;  <br />For the record, I believe Alicia Keys has shown that her five Grammys were not a fluke.  Nor is she a superficial singer, like Ashanti.  She is the cream of the crop where her talent and artistry are concerned.  It was good to see her move away from Clive Davis on this record, and find more of her own voice.  I will continue to follow her career with interest.
630521610X|1.0|I remember when SCREAM came out, and everyone was telling me about it. After finally renting it, I wanted my money back. There really isn't any point to the movie, accept that this pyscho goes around killing every teenager. The only part worth seeing is when Henry Winkler, (&quot;Fonzie from HAPPY DAYS kids), plays the principle. He eventually falls victim to the killer as well, and I'm surprised he didn't just cut up the black sheet with the scissors and tell the kid to go to class. This movie is another one of those that is aimed at teengers. Well, I was a teenager at the time, and I hated it. Save your money and get the first 2 HALLOWEEN movies.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|In what seems to be another holiday timed marketing ploy, Let It Be...Naked has been released minus two great Let It Be Tracks but plus Don't Let Me Down. Just different enough, and with a bonus &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; CD of studio conversations and slices of songs, that a true Beatles fan will have to have it. For those of us who like the Beatles but already own all their albums (or CDs, if you prefer), listen to a friend's Fly on the Wall disc - it is certainly interesting to listen to, once. Then move on.  Very disappointing overall.
B000099T2L|4.0|I am, and probably always will be, a die-hard DC fan. I will try to be as unbiased as possible on this review though. Every one of the songs on this album caught my attention in a special way, and only on the track \\"Hip-Hop Star\\" did my attention get caught in a less-than-good way. The lyrics on this track are too sexually explicit for me. Don't get me wrong, beyonce is not going to the extremes of, say, Lil Kim, but in one part she says, \\"I dare you to undress me.\\" Other than that, though, this album meets and at times surpasses my expectations for Ms. B. \\"Baby Boy\\" is fantastic, \\"Daddy\\" made me go misty-eyed, and \\"Signs,\\" besides being majorly catchy, finally made me memorize the order of the signs in the zodiac!! (I get seventeen mag, and now know exactly where to find my sign without major searching.) Anyway, though this album is not my fave of the DC girls' solo efforts (that honor goes to Kelly rowland), this is something worth checking out!<BR>(If you would like to leave more detailed feedback on this review, please click on the \\"See more about me\\" link, and look for the URL to my website.)
B0000C8AVM|3.0|&quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; is Bob Dylan's greatest album in the same way that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; represents the Beatles at their best and &quot;Tommy&quot; is the Who's best. Translated into simple english, that means it's not really his best at all. It's a good album, but its inflated reputation can only be due to the fact that after &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; Dylan's ambitions were too modest for his fans' expectations. Coming on the heels of &quot;Nashville Skyline,&quot; &quot;Self Portrait,&quot; &quot;New Morning,&quot; the &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; soundtrack, and &quot;Planet Waves,&quot; well, this seemed like a masterpiece, especially since Dylan was returning to his acoustic roots.  But just as the Beatles did better work than &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; (&quot;Rubber Soul,&quot; &quot;Magical Mystery Tour,&quot; and the &quot;White Album&quot; for starters) and the Who did better than &quot;Tommy&quot; (not only &quot;Who's Next&quot; but also &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;), Dylan has done better than &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; (namely &quot;Blonde on Blonde,&quot; &quot;John Wesley Harding,&quot; &quot;Desire,&quot; &quot;Street Legal,&quot; and &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;).<br />As for the remastering, to be honest, I have no idea if this &quot;Hybrid SACD&quot; reissue has superior sound than the version otherwise available (I don't have an SACD player) but even if it is, I wouldn't really care. The discs I own sound damn good to me, and besides I consider this entire series of remastered Dylan albums a bit of a ripoff. If Sony is going to re-release these albums, why don't they do it right and put together the complete &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; containing both the album Dylan recorded in New York during September 1974 and the versions he re-recorded in December of the same year in Minnesota? You know they'll do it someday, just as they'll go back and re-assemble &quot;Infidels&quot; to include &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; and &quot;Foot of Pride.&quot; And they'll expect Dylan fans to then go out and spend another small fortune buying yet another series of remastered discs. Not me, baby. I'll wait until they really remaster these titles the way they should have been remastered a long time ago.
B000006TRV|5.0|It's amazing that Pink Floyd has come out with two amazing groundbreaking albums (Dark Side of the Moon and the Wall).Dark Side of the Moon spent over 10 years on the Billboard charts! The Wall is their next greatest effort with outstanding songs such as &quot;The Happiest Days of Our Lives/Another Brick in the Wall Part 2,&quot; &quot;Empty Spaces/Young Lust,&quot; &quot;Hey You,&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb.&quot; Each one of these songs defines the many sounds of Pink Floyd. There is hard rock, progressive rock, and some music that defies genres. Most of the last group is really weird music which some people swear has a deeper meaning, but really Floyd was just high when they wrote the songs. Even if you own the original record or tape you must get the CD, because all of the great songs are so much more amazing as digitally remastered, which includes better sound quality and the instruments and singing sound better and clearer. Buy this album just to here the song &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; because it is that good.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|There are other Bob Dylan albums I like more than this one, but I always think of this as the most \\"Dylanesque\\" of his albums (if you know what I mean). Love that spooky \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" just as much as \\"Like a Rolling Stone.\\"
0553212621|5.0|Why does everybody think this book is about sex and adultry? Probably because it was banned, being a bit ahead of its time. In reality, this book is a lovely, wonderful metaphor for the arrival of the era of mechanization and the industrial revolution, as set against the \\"England of the Greenwood\\" (E. M. Forster). Lawrence appears to have had a fascination for this theme, as it occurs in some of his other novels as well. Far from being shunned as inappropriate for young adult readers, Lady Chatterly's Lover ought to be taught, at least at the college level, because it's a marvelous novel and should be appreciated as much, much more than a simple \\"dirty book.\\"
B0000C8AVX|4.0|My dad really likes this album. He likes almost all of Bob Dylan's albums. He says Bob Dylan is \\"groovy, baby.\\" My dad actually talks like that. He's an old hippie who smoked dope and sniffed glue to all the 60s rock classics. I smoke dope and sniff glue too, and spend the money I get from welfare on dope, glue, and Bob Dylan albums.
0553213105|4.0|An abundance of pride and prejudice inflicted on the two main characters, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, is the main obstacle of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen.  The actions of the novel revolve around the central characters who undergo tremendous changes to overcome their faults.  Mr. Darcy is accused of having such a pride that he could not believe Elizabeth appropriate enough to barely be in his presence.  From then on, Elizabeth formed harsh judgments about Mr. Darcy and his personality.  Their first impressions of one another clung to them so deeply that establishing a relationship was all the more heartwarming.  The actions of the novel, between not only Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, but with the entire Bennet family and other acquaintances, kept me wanting to read on for more.  My heart was into each character and I could not wait to find out more about their relations.  I felt myself laughing  and, at times, talking out loud because of the actions of the novel. I remained in suspense throughout, which made the events more enjoyable.  I cannot wait for the opportunity to read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; again in my free time.  I highly recommend the novel to anyone in search of a plot and a love for characters to read the amazing writing of Jane Austen.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think that &quot;In the Zone&quot; is Britney's best CD. She jsut keeps coming out with music that just keeps getting better and better. I like the whole CD and some of my favorites are &quot;Me against the music&quot; &quot;Boom boom&quot; &quot;breathe on me&quot; and &quot;Everytime.&quot; My absolute favoirte song is &quot;Toxic.&quot; That song is so brilliant and is one of her greatest songs ever. The violins and the lyrics are just brilliant and she sounds great. This CD was worth the 2 year wait and I still love Britney!!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Now in order to put this album in it's proper perspective you<BR>must remember that the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album was only mere<BR>fragments of what The Beatles as &quot;nature intended&quot;-as re-done<BR>ever questionably be Phil Spector.Well he's not on THIS album<BR>so for those curious Beatle fans who do not own &quot;Let It Be&quot; buy<BR>this instead.&quot;The Long And Winding Road,&quot;The Two Of Us&quot;,<BR>George Harrison's bluesy ditty &quot;For You Blue&quot; and all the Beatles classics are found here stripped down and without the<BR>between-song patter of the orginal album.But both are available<BR>on CD so take your pick.As an ameteur compilist I enjoy hearing<BR>John Lennon discussing how they will play 'out the angels come'<BR>at the albums opening but I think both these albums are worth<BR>having-there are important differences and this actually sounds alot more musical then &quot;Let It Be&quot;.But is it too late?Not really-<BR>you choose whitch one suits your fancy!

This DVD now rests in a position of honor, right in my DVD player just waiting and ready for my morning dose of Goonies happiness.  This movie (even more so than the Breakfas Club) takes a host of sterotypes (Nerd, Geek, Jock, Cheerleader, Fat kid, ad nausem) and show that inside we *all* are goonies, we just don't know it.<br />&quot;Thats like my moms favorite piece!&quot;

B0000E1ALR|4.0|When compiling a \\"best of\\" collection of songs from an artist like Bruce Springsteen-and you can include the Beatles, the Who, the Clash and Bob Dylan in this-the question really isn't what to include but what can be left out? Indeed, as most of his albums are thematic, it can be difficult to hear his songs out of context; thus the 1995 \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection didn't make emotional sense. <br />But if you're looking for \\"essential\\" Bruce-songs that define his art and career and are the backbone of his perspective on life, America, and rock music, then this album comes fairly close. All of his albums and epochs are represented on two CDs, albeit briefly. His wonderfully funky first two albums are finally represented-they were totally ignored on the \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation-and there is a welcome third CD of oddities, rarities, and b-sides that had not previously been collected. The set can serve as an introduction to the man's work, though I still tell friends to start by simply buying the first six albums-Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ (1973); The Wild, The Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle (1973); Born to Run (1975); Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978); The River (1980); Nebraska (1982)-and then picking and choosing from the rest. The magnificent Tracks (1998), however, belongs in any record collection. It is the best anthology of its kind-unreleased cuts, alternate versions, collected B-sides-even if it fails to include \\"The Fever,\\" \\"Held Up Without a Gun,\\" and \\"The Big Payback.\\"<br />But to truly capture the essential Bruce, it requires at least another CD of songs. Sure there are three cuts from the debut album, but where are \\"Growin' Up,\\" \\"Lost in the Flood,\\" and the lovely \\"Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?\\" (Just listen to him sing the line \\"Love's like that-sure it is\\"). We get \\"Sandy\\" and \\"Rosalita\\" from the second album, but what about the magnificent \\"Incident on 57th Street\\" and \\"Wild Billy's Circus Story\\"? (E Street drummer Max Weinberg's favorite Bruce song). Better yet, give us the live version of \\"Billy\\" from the 1974 CBS executives' convention that was released to DJs only. I've got it and it's great.<br />There are three cuts from Born to Run, but why was the thunderous \\"Backstreets\\" left behind? You could include all ten cuts from \\"Darkness,\\" but being prudent, at least \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\" and \\"Something in the Night\\" and \\"Prove It All Night\\" should have made this collection. <br />\\"The River\\" had its faults but where are \\"The Ties That Bind,\\" \\"Two Hearts,\\" \\"Cadillac Ranch\\" and \\"Fade Away\\"? Really, if any Bruce is essential it's \\"Cadillac Ranch\\" and \\"The Fever,\\" which was written shortly after \\"The Wild, The Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle\\" and only released on 1999's \\"18 Tracks.\\" Why aren't they here?<br />It's the same story for the other albums-how could \\"Open All Night\\" or \\"Used Cars\\" from \\"Nebraska,\\" \\"Born in the U.S.A.'s\\" \\"My Hometown,\\" \\"Tunnel of Love's\\" \\"Tougher Than the Rest\\" or \\"Soul Driver\\" and \\"Real World,\\" \\"Lucky Town,\\" \\"Souls of the Departed\\" and \\"Beautiful Reward\\" from \\"Human Touch\\" and \\"Lucky Town\\" be left out? What about \\"Light of Day\\"? or \\"Youngstown\\" and \\"Dry Lightning\\" from \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\\" or \\"Into the Fire\\" and \\"Worlds Apart\\" from \\"The Rising\\"?<br />Moreover, albums like this are an opportunity to let unusual or alternate versions of songs see the light of day, but this does not happen. Legend has it that a rockabilly version of \\"You Can Look But You Better Not Touch\\" was recorded with just Bruce on guitar, Garry Tallent (bass) and Max Weinberg (drums), so why can't we hear it now? As for \\"Born in the U.S.A.,\\" various CDs have the studio cut on the album of the same name, live band and solo versions, and the demo from the \\"Nebraska\\" sessions...so why not give us the fabled 17-minute version from the original studio take? And how about studio versions of \\"Fire\\" and \\"Because the Night\\" from the \\"Darkness\\" sessions, which we've only heard live?<br />Want the answer to all these questions? Money. CBS doesn't want to do a four or five-disc set and besides, if they really put all the essential Bruce tracks on this collection, then no one would buy the regular studio albums.<br />The other side of greatest hits albums is that we often hear a lot of things we don't need to hear again. To my ears, <BR>\\"Hungry Heart\\" and \\"Mary's Place\\" are among Bruce's weakest songs. However, for others they're favorites, which only furthers the point that these albums never satisfy everyone. <br />Let's face it: compilations of any great artists are difficult to make perfect. Even last year's \\"Forty Licks\\" from the Rolling Stones could easily have been \\"Sixty Licks.\\" And what always looms over these sets is the desperate need of the record companies to haul in cash. Commercial interests reign supreme these days. Look at it from this perspective: Had CBS merely released the third disc here, the rarities would not have sold well, even though many fans want it to complete their collections. As my brother asked, \\"Why do we have to buy three discs to get the one we wanted?\\" And if CBS had only released the first two discs, it still wouldn't have sold as well. So they combined all three to catch the diehards as well as the casual listeners-and they didn't do a very good job on the packaging, either. For CBS, it all came down to the bottom line. <br />Fortunately, technology has caught up to the record companies. You want the Essential Bruce Springsteen? Borrow a friend's collection and burn your own CDs. <br />But a last word: Thanks, Bruce. Thanks for being so talented, for caring so much, and for working so hard. Thanks for everything.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|So much is included in this set that I could not possibly talk about it all. Just getting all the bonus features for the first Alien movie is worth the money right there. You could almost watch this set 24 hours a day for 3 days straight. <br />The picture and sound is awesome, the bonus features are incredibly cool. I found the info on the original idea and alien design especially interesting. The only bad thing is the stupid case. Whoever decided to go with the fold out box is an idiot. If you fold it out it's about 4 feet long which is awkward to say the least.<br />Overall an excellent set worth every penny even if you're not really crazy about the last two movies like me.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let me start by saying that I don't usually write reviews on Amazon.com. But I feel pretty strongly about this series.<br />I've noticed in the past year that there have been a few DVD sets of shows that FOX killed prematurely. &quot;The Tick&quot; and &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; are the first two that spring to mind. Neither one was a masterpiece, but each showed real promise. You can tell by the last few episodes of each that they had reached their stride and were about to become something really good.<br />Now, &quot;Firefly&quot; is something altogether different. Joss Whedon's sci-fi/western found it's stride by the end of the first ten minutes of the first episode. Just the idea of having spaceships in an old west setting was a stroke of genius. But, this show was also brilliantly written and had characters you actually liked and related to. It's the perfect example of a network not recognizing a show for it's quality and giving it a shot. FOX obviously didn't give &quot;Firefly&quot; a chance from the beginning. Has anyone who bought the DVD noticed that the episodes were originally aired COMPLETELY out of order? How can you show the introductory episode 3 months after the series started?<br />At least FOX had the presence of mind to release a DVD that lives up to this amazing show. All 13 episodes (including the unaired episodes) and a ton of extras (that are actually worth watching) make for the type of DVD set more TV shows should shoot for.<br />Anyway, get it. It's more than worth it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|How enjoyable it is to see excellent literature made into an excellent movie. I have to say that when I first heard that Peter Jackson was taking on this project my first thoughts were that he had bitten off more than he could chew. Yet he continues to amaze me. I for one like Peter's interpretation of the books and have overwhelmingly approved of his direction in the films. Most of the reviewers I have read who do nothing but complain about the films are very unrealistic and have no concept of what it takes to make a movie from a book. What Tolkien could describe to the imagination of the reader with a sentence or two a movie might need half an hour to do it properly. When viewing a movie such as this it must be understood that certain elements of the book must be sacrificed for the sake of continuity in the film. To generalize movie making as the same as writing a book is hopelessly naive. <br />With that said this DVD provides a much more complete version of the story. Several welcome additions were present in this DVD that fill in the rough spots quite nicely. The extended sequences with the Ents in particular comes to mind. I especially was pleased to see that Merry and Pippin growing taller from the Ent water was in the film too. <br />The picture and sound quality of the DVD are crisp and clean. I have not yet explored all the bonus material so for that I cannot comment. All in all this movie is an great take on a classic work of fiction and should be owned by any Tolkien fan.
B000089QEN|1.0|Vanity Fair is one of my all-time favorite novels, but while the book's wry social satire is perfectly crafted and executed, the translation to film was difficult to watch.  I did so to its conclusion, but only because I had paid good money for the set, and guilt alone made me stick it out.  Never before has such garish ugliness been presented so relentlessly.  Though the acting throughout is tolerable, I found the casting to be lackluster at best.  Many of the characters are monstrously presented, and with the exception of Becky Sharp, who is delightfully played by a beautiful young actress named Natasha Little, in my opinion the whole thing would have done well to be recast.  Making matters worse is the hideous musical score, which seems to consist mostly of accordian or some other screechingly jarring instrument, played in an unnecessarily over-the-top, satirical style that jolted me from the story each time I heard it, and, sadly, I heard it alot.  This is not a well-depicted telling, and I caution everyone not to waste their hard earned dollars.  I am completely stunned that people actually gave 5 stars to this awful rendering of a masterful work of literature.  The fact that it is a faithful adaptation of the story is completely obscured by the deliberately circus-style uglification employed to emphasize the bawdy qualities of the tale and many of its characters.  That's how bad the production and direction are.  They ruined a fabulous opportunity to bring a great book to life. Do not make the same mistake I did in trusting the recommendations of earlier reviewers. Sometimes we just need to stick with the book, and this is definitely one of those occasions!
0553213105|5.0|I have to say that Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books I have ever read...and I have read a LOT! I think the first time I picked it up was back in 6th grade. I loved it then, but how much does a sixth grader really get out of it? Reading it again for my English class opened my eyes to some of the more subtle humor and details Austen includes in her witty satire of Regency England's society and customs, particularly those dealing with marriage. Perhaps one of the reasons I liked this novel so much was-it wasn't a \\"fluff\\" romance. I admit, I love romances, but this one surpasses them all, simply because it has sustenance. It has a fully-developed plot, well-thought-out characters, etc. It is thought-provoking and at the same time, a fun read.<br />The heroine of the novel, Elizabeth Bennet, is intelligent, witty, and-of course-prejudiced. Mr. Darcy, the proud hero, epitomizes the saying, \\"Appearances can be deceiving.\\" Lizzie's journey to true love is fraught with obstacles-some of her own making and some due to her matchmaking mama; her indulgent, sarcastic, and perhaps at times insensitive father; her love-lorn older sister; and two boy-crazy younger sisters.
0385504209|2.0|While the subjects upon which the plot of this book are built are interesting ones, this book fails to live up to the great potential for a truly suspenseful and interesting story that could be created about them.<br />I think Dan Brown makes a fool of himself by trying to sound intelligent and knowledgeable with unnecessary flourishes, only to follow up by spelling everything out so deliberately that he insults the reader's intelligence.  It makes him come off like a pompous professor, and not a very bright one at that.<br />Similarly, the dumbed-down dialogue undermines the intellectual potential of the subjects.  I laughed out loud when someone described as a high vatican official actually said &quot;the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.&quot;  He should have followed up with &quot;Bummer -- eh, dude?&quot;<br />In parts it reads like a cheap romance novel -- you can tick off the steps in the characters' romance, which are just stuck in awkwardly throughout the book, and are only there so the book can end as a schmaltzy and uncompelling love story.<br />I'll admit that it's a quick and engaging read, but there were too many times when I thought &quot;okay!  I get it!  can we PLEASE move on?!&quot;  And while it kept me busy during a long flight, by the end I felt cheated.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This 1982 version of Annie is the best. The newer version can't even touch it. The older one has everything a musical should and it doesn't leave out character development like the newer one. The original Annie makes me still want to get up and dance and sing along! I am appalled when people say they have only seen the new one because they are missing out on so much! The older one tells the story of orphan Annie as is should be told and makes you truly get involved with the characters. Carol Burnett is absolutely perfect in the role of Miss Hannigan, a lush who goes after anything male and living and Albert Finney is wonderful in his portrayal of Daddy Warbucks, the hard no-nonsense kinda of guy who eventually realizes that there is more to life than money. Aileen Quinn has a wonderful voice and is wonderfully exuberant in her role as Annie. This is definetely a must see movie!
0792839730|4.0|I managed to pick up a copy of the MGM Special Edition here in Aussie land for 10 bucks (yipee).<br />It features 2 Disks Including;<BR>- Audio Commentary with William Goldman<BR>- Theatrical trailer<BR>- &quot;Heroes from the sky&quot; Documentary<BR>- A Distant Battle: Memories of Operation Market Garden (this is excellent its great to get the low down from veterans who were there)<BR>- Richard Attenborough: A film maker remembers Documentary<BR>- Photo gallery<br />And certainly seems much better than the version offered here at Amazon. It is also produced by MGM so i'd advise anyone looking to pick up this classic movie to look for the MGM Special Edition.
0679428895|4.0|Having visited Pompei a couple of years ago and having had a rather truamatic experience there myself, ( My wife and daughter got seperated from me and it took me 4 hours to find them - Pompeii is big!)this book really fleshed out that experience. The last half of the book is particularly compelling to one who has visited because it has been accurately researched and the streets, locales in the book correspond to what you will experience there. Also many of the prominent characters correspond to names on election posters on the walls of the streets. After seeing the tortured looking stone figures of the victims of Vesuvius at Pompeiithe description of the eruption is particularly compelling. The insights into the administration of the aqueducts, the corruption etc. also is very interesting. The characters could have been more fully developed but in the end this does not deter from the engaging experience of reading the book. Bottom line: If you're going to visit Pompeii make it a point to read this book first and then bring it with you so you can visit the spots described not only in Pompeii but also in Herculaneum and Stabaie, Miseneum etc. and also the mountain itself.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|So Paul says this is as nature intended? I like it, but why was Paul so upset with the original. After all, every McCartney concert and live recording of The Long and Winding Road seems to emulate the Spector recording.I don't get it.
B0000931QR|5.0|Estos españolitos estan de vuelta despues de su ya aclamado disco &quot;El Viaje de Copperpot&quot; con un super disco: &quot;Lo que te conte mientras te hacias la dormida&quot; (que titulo tan intenso y largo).<br />Todas las canciones en este álbum esta increible.  Noy hay ninguna que me gustaria saltar pues es un disco de calidad y talento. La voz de Amaia si que sobre sale.<br />De nuevo, todas la canciones me gustan, pero hay una que me encantan.  Voy a calificar las que me encantan de este álbum.<br />~1: Puedes Contar conmigo: Esta canción es para cualquier persona que quieras: tu pareja, tu amiga(o), tu mamá, tu hermana(o), o X persona.  Lo importante es que le estas diciendo que esta persona puede contar contigo por todo el timpo.

B0000C6E4D|4.0|Sarah has an amazing voice and a gift for lyrics.  She reaches into her heart and expresses her feelings in a spectacular way.  This album is devoted to her daughter and her mother who recently passed away.  No, it's not Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, but it has beauty of it's own.  I am just thrilled she came out with something new.  At first I was a little disappointed, just not knowing quite what to expect, but like all of her music it grew on me and now I love it at least  as much as her other previous CD's.  If you are a die hard Sarah fan, you will love this like all the others.
B00005YW4H|5.0|At first I thought she was so overated, but now I bought her CD and I love it. I can listen to every track without skipping. She is an artist in a time when image is so much more important than the music. It is really nice to see someone who can sing, write, and perform. She makes me glad that I can hear.
B00004BZ16|4.0|Loved the music, hated the politics.  Would that have offended Joe Strummer? I hope not.  Their music stands by itself.  And while this album was a bit too long, it still represents a great album one of the greatest band of all-time.  RIP, Joe.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I think that she is one of the best singers I have ever heard and that sometimes people judge her by her clothes when the music matters the most. Her album was beautiful and as a man I looked past her good looks and listened to her CD and it was excellent. &quot;Beautiful&quot; should be an inspiration to a lot of people and that song alone makes her album a must have. By the way if anyone says that her ablum is trash or Britney Spears is better, they should get their ears checked.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys doesn't stop. She will not be moved. This is the best album I own to date. I at first perceived her at a bit overrated, but now that is not the case. This girl has SOUL! The album is the perfect blend of hip-hop, soul, jazz and classical. She tries different things on this album that are way different from the first. This album can play all the way through and then 3 more times, because it is ADDICTING. There are no songs you will wanna skip. This album flows very nicely. There are two songs that have to grow on you which are &quot;Dragon Days&quot; and &quot;Mr. Samsonite Man&quot;. Those two are very different from Alicia, so they will take a little more time to get used to, but besides that every song on this album if hot. If you don't have this cd you are really missing out.
0156027321|5.0|Is there anything better in life than enjoying a novel so much that you don't want to finish it?  A novel so good that you ration the chapters to make it last as long as you can?  Characters that you can almost feel breathing through the pages?  These types of novels are few and far between but Life of Pi definitely qualifies.  I'm angry at myself for not picking it up sooner than I did.<br />The story, as told by Pi Patel to author Yann Martel, is one of courage, faith, determination, creativity and survival.  In young Pi, we find a wisdom and spirituality far beyond his 16 years, but we're constantly reminded of how human he really is.  In fact, the beauty of Mr. Martel's writing is that he can so effortlessly make the non-human characters spring to life with their own unique personalities just as much as the human characters.  While we pray for the safety of Pi, we are just are frightened for that of Richard Parker's--the 450 pound Bengal Tiger who poses as Pi's #1 threat.  It takes a truly gifted writer to make the audience root for the survival of both the antagonist and protagonist of a novel.<br />True to it's claim, if this story does not make you believe in God, it will, at the very least, make you re-evaluate your beliefs.  An especially intriguing touch are the parallels between zoology and religion (and I guarantee that you will never look at zoos and zoo animals the same way again). <br />I'm finding it hard to put into words the feeling I was left with upon finishing this book, but it's almost like seeing a movie that was so engaging you can't get up from your seat until the credits have stopped rolling.  I think words like &quot;heartwarming&quot; tend to cheapen something, but I can think of no other word but &quot;warmth&quot; to describe the feeling I had after finishing the last page.  I can't stop thinking about this book.  I can't stop talking about it.  This is one delicious slice of pi.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Like the first Strokes cd, one song caught my attention. The song 12:51 instantly became my new favorite strokes song. After hearing the song, i went out and bought the cd and was not dissapointed. This cd is very much like their first cd, but in a good way. Also like the first cd, After listening to the entire cd a good 3 times, i was hooked and became my new favorite cd. In this cd, Julian does an amazing job at the vocals (after the third time of listening to the cd, you wont even notice his distorted voice) and the guitar riffs are awesome. The Strokes are a rare band with catchy, rock beats that actually accomplish sounding like a 60's-70's rock band. If you enjoy classic rock such as the rolling stones and bands of that nature, i suggest you check this band out. Don't buy into the new crap like Good Charlotte and bands like that. Take a retro trip and listen to The Strokes.<br />Strokes Rule!!!
B00003CX95|3.0|A vanity production if there ever was one, Mel Gibson's 1995 &quot;Braveheart&quot; is not so much a movie as it is a video game of medieval mayhem. As the 13th Century Scottish rebel Sir William Wallace, Mel makes love to beautiful women, fights gruesome battles, and barks speeches filled with repetitions of those democratic catchwords &quot;country&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot;. Aware that the average 14-year old's eyes glaze at the mere mention of the 13th Century, the screenplay by Randall Wallace skims over the English domination of Scotland, quickly resorting to standard blood and guts, while the conflict between the clans and William Wallace's uneasy allegiance are too sketchy to be enlightening. Edward I of England, called Longshanks,is the movie's villain; and he's represented as a sadistic psychopath. In &quot;A History of the English Speaking Peoples&quot; Winston S Churchill says that Edward I &quot;presents us with qualities which are a mixture of the administrative capacity of Henry II and the personal prowess and magnanimity of Coeur de Lion.&quot; Granted, Churchill was somewhat partial to royalty, but another source says Edward I was &quot;at heart a good and honest man.&quot; In a hagiography like &quot;Braveheart&quot; the opposition must look as bad as possible if the hero's murders and arson are going to be represented as sympathetic, so Longshanks gets the shaft. (Shakespeare had to dramatize Richard III as a ruthless child-killer to make justifiable the usurpation of Henry VII, who was the grandfather of Shakespeare's sovereign.) As a director, Mel Gibson is no Eisenstein. As an actor, he woodenly plays Wallace as a peace-loving man who just wants to tend his farm and raise a family. When Edward establishes droit de seigneur in Scotland, Wallace marries in secret, but even then his wife is assaulted by English soldiers. In defending her honor, Wallace starts the rebellion almost by accident; and he soon becomes the hero of the Scottish cause,his followers (in a ludicrously anachronistic touch) chanting &quot;Wah-les! Wah-les! Wah-les!&quot; Little is known of the real William Wallace, the nearest thing to a biography being a poem that may or may not have been written by a bard named Henry the Minstrel about 180 years after Wallace's death. There is no mention of this poem in the movie's credits. Whether or not Wallace was multilingual is anyone's guess, but it's extremely unlikely he had an affair with the future Queen of England, a subplot thrown in to gratify the Harlequin Romance element in the audience. Isabella is depicted here as a yearning soul, but she's known to history as the &quot;she-wolf&quot; because of her cold-blooded betrayal of her husband Edward II. I know a lot of reviewers have said &quot;Lighten up, it's only a movie&quot;, and I would agree if &quot;Braveheart&quot; were not so solemn and sententious. Bending facts is one thing (Sir Walter Scott did it all the time), but then to plaster these distortions across the screen in pseudo-historic splendor is a little dishonest. Now I see that Mel's coming out with a film based on the Passion. God help us.
B00007E8V4|3.0|well this EP was good, but it did have some problems, first off these are mainly songs that are stuff that didn't make it on to Toxicity, and for good reason, many are repititious and just plain annoying when all it is is screaming, and what I don't get is why X wasn't on this Album (listen to X on Toxicity and you'll probably agree) and Roulette wasn't on Toxicity. The other problem is the fact that it's overproduced. and yes you heard me right, I called it an EP and not an album, simply for the fact that it is presented, plays like, and sounds like a SOAD EP. And if yer gonna give bad reviws to a cd review the CD, don't put up Ad Hominem comments about the band. (BTW an Ad Hominem comment is when you consider a pice of art, wether it be music, art, or writing, to be bad because you dislike the band, for example, System of a down sucks because they're all against war. =Ad Hominem)
0385504209|1.0|With much hoopla and praise behind it, and an intriguing concept for the plot, I picked up Brown's The Da Vinci Code with enthusiasm.  The premise is that there is an incredible secret that the Catholic Church will stop at nothing to suppress, and warring secret societies plot to possess this powerful information.  The secret has been protected and kept by such luminaries throughout history as Isaac Newton, Dan Quayle, and, yes, Leonardo Da Vinci (I'm being facetious about one of those).<br />Promising start, but from there is all goes downhill.  The main charactors are intensely familiar from airport novels galore - the intelligent and unconventionally beautiful heroine (whose strong, clear eyes keep flashing), and the intelligent and unconventionally handsome hero (who keeps giving lopsided grins).  These cookie-cutter charactors lack real depth, and instead are given quirks with pat explanations that well-written charactors don't need.<br />The plot jerks around, with one cliff-hanging chapter after another, with so little pay-off that it comes off as just manipulative rather than honestly suspenseful.  And here's the big disappointment: the revelations - about Church, Da Vinci, and the Holy Grail - are all completely passe.  We knew that already!  Or at least you should know all this information already if you had spent at least a little time reading about Church, art, or feminist history.  Or even if you watch the Discovery Channel on a semi-regular basis!<br />So my advise is:  Go buy a book on Church history, art history, or Barbara G. Walker's Women's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets if you're interested in this kind of thing.  Unless you can't read about history without a mad albino monk villian and a heroine who walks with long, fluid strides to liven things up - in which case, fair enough, this book is for you.
B0000C1733|3.0|I have always been an enthusiastic fan of the Chili Peppers unique, funky music stylings.  I was skeptical about getting this cd until I saw the package that came with the DVD, and couldnt resist all the videos on one disc.  The cd itself left more to be desired for the second offering of greatest hits on one cd.  Like most compilations, it has its ups and downs.<br />Tracks like &quot;Higher Ground&quot; and &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; are among the best of their earlier years, but have already found their way onto the last greatest hits compilation.  This is ten years later, and Chili Peppers fans need the newer generations tunes of &quot;Around the World,&quot; &quot;Can't Stop,&quot; &quot;The Zephyr Song,&quot; and &quot;Aeroplane&quot; to name a few.  If I were producing this album, I would have gladly sacrificed not so popular singles such as &quot;Universally Speaking&quot; or &quot;Road Trippin'&quot; to see these loveable tracks make the cut.<br />Don't get me wrong, the cd has plenty of positive notions as well, which made me want to buy it in the first place.  The new tracks &quot;Fortune Faded&quot; and &quot;Save the Population&quot; make nice additions to the RHCP library, and fit in seemlessly as if they were hits of their own.  The forever enjoyable &quot;Soul to Squeeze&quot; finally gets onto CD form other then the Coneheads Soundtrack.<br />When all is said and done, every track on this cd is amazing and anyone starting to get into the Chili Peppers might want to pick this up.  Otherwise hardcore fans would want to pick this up as well for the amazing DVD set.  Otherwise, purchase all the albums and pick your own favorites.
B00006J3WH|4.0|I became intrested in Buffy after it was finished for some reason, and have been watching it in reruns. I also have a theatre background, so this soundtrack and this episode were a must. Most of the songs are incredible; The music on all of them is excellent. However, it would have been much better without Nic Brendon and Allyson Hannigan singing on it. They can't sing. Sorry guys. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, she may not be that powerful, but at least she can carry a tune. And she did have a few bits of power, during &quot;Walk Through The Fire&quot;, and &quot;Something To Sing About&quot;. Here's the review song by song:<br />1. Overture/Something To Sing About - Good song. The lyrics are well-written, the music matches a good Broadway opener, but Gellar is too weak here. 3.5/5<br />2. I've Got A Throy/Bunnies/If We're Together - The opening is hilarious, Anya's solo is even better, the ending is cliched and unimportant. 3.5/5<br />3. The Mustard - Sucks. End of story. 1/5<br />4. I'm Under Your Spell - Amber Benson is one of the best singers in this cast. Music is great, lyrics are great, vocals are great. 5/5<br />5. I'll Never Tell - Funniest song on the CD. Emma Caulfield has a decent voice, but Nic Brendon does bring it down a notch. The writing is great, so this one still comes out a winner. 4.5/5<br />6. The Parking Ticket - Not as bad as Mustard, but still bad. 2/5<br />7. Rest In Peace - Great song. Sure, Marsters can't hit every note perfectly, but what singer who sings this type of song can? It's a great listen. 5/5<br />8. Dawn's Lament - Useless. At least the music's good though. 3.5<br />9. Dawn's Ballet - Great scoring. Even on its own, without the visuals, this one works. 4/5<br />10. What You Feel - Jazzy, great singing, great listen. Hinton Battle is all style, but with substance. Michelle Trachtenberg does affect this song, though, so it can't be perfect. 4.5/5<br />11. Standing - My second favorite on the CD. Anthony Head is a great singer; the song is touching, well written, great musically, what else can be said? 5/5<br />12. I'm Under Your Spell/Standing (Reprise) - Okay. A little short, but the meshing of the voices works. 4/5<br />13. Walk Through The Fire - My favorite song on the CD. It's funny where it should be, it's deep, it's powerful, the music is excellent, the singing is excellent (except for Willow's line), and the harmony at the end is incredible. 5.5/5<br />14. Something To Sing About - The &quot;Life's A Show&quot; part I could have done without. The ending is good, it's deep. And this is one of the few areas where Sarah Michelle Gellar's voice becomes powerful. 4/5<br />15. What You Feel (Reprise) - Read the review for the first one. Same thing. Only shorter, which sucks. 3/5<br />16. Where Do We Go From Here? - This is really one that's short and sweet. Very poignant too, if you think about it. 4.5/5<br />17. Coda - Not much to be said. very average. 3/5<br />18/19. Main Title/End Credits - Average scoring. Okay for what it is. 3/5<br />20. Suite from Restless - Beautiful. That's all that can be said. Aurally stunning. 5/5<br />21. Suite from Hush - So haunting. It's incredible. 5/5<br />22. Sacrifice - Great scoring. Too shirt though. 4.5/5<br />I don;t care about the demo, so I'm not gonna comment on it.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's fourth and best book<br />This mystery thriller doesn't disappoint as it examines how history might have been rewritten if certain historical events had played out differently. Multi-layered, the book takes readers on a trip through a puzzle that requires a different set of operating instructions for each of the levels. And here's the fun part: when you've finished the book, you can go further in the quest via a website!<br />Superb.
B00005RYL2|4.0|This film is fascinating in many ways. I have the European version with the flashback to the second world war but without the killing of Yung Dol Kim by the Kurgan, which explains the discrepancy in one scene where a paper title announces : HEAD HUNTER 3 POLICE 0. In fact there has only been two killings by the Kurgan at this moment, and will never be three in the film anyway. But it is a marvellous film built on constant flashbacks, very well done all of them, and this navigation through time is thrilling. Then it presents us with a plot that is of interest for our over-famous post-modern world. A new species of humans is born by some mutation. These humans are immortal but they are supposed to fight to the last and to their death for only one of them to survive. This last one is granted special powers over the world. This is a new version, a post-god version of God, as if our imagination and brain could not survive and work properly without a supreme being of some kind. We are here dealing with an essential dimension of human civilization : men need a supreme principle, on a higher level than themselves, to be able to manage the world, manage its knowledge and science, manage its peace and violence. But this archetypical approach goes even farther and reaches a mythical level. We are dealing with a species that pushes its roots deep in the oldest human civilizations : the Celts in Scotland, the « archaic » societies in Siberia or Russia, old Japanese societies, etc. This new species is founded on two elements : they have to fight in duels with broad swords and they can only die if they are decapitated. The first element is typical of the iron age, of the iron society best represented in our history by the Celts, with some roots in the ancient Greek mythology with their Gods of fire and metalwork (smithing), but also with the Greek Zeus and the Celtic Lud, and even the Biblical and Semitic God, who have the power to dominate and use thunder and lightning to punish and frighten men. This touches something in the average public that goes beyond simple action. It moves some old stories, and even superstitions, in our memory, in the memory of humanity. This is one of the deepest layers of our human and universal consciousness or unconsciousness. This then makes a gripping film for which the added suspense and spectacular action can only become mesmerizing.

0316096199|5.0|Frankly, I liked (if that's a word that can be used about a book concerning the subject of personal rape) Lucky more than The Lovely Bones, her second book, the one that put her on the map. Perhaps `appreciated' would be a better word for my feelings about Lucky. <BR>To bare oneself, to detail the experience of rape so unsparingly, to extend the memoir back to her childhood and forward to her downward spiral into heroin addiction and depression is to strip naked for your public. It takes guts, something Alice Sebold has in spades.<BR>The book's title comes from a comment by a cop that she should consider herself \\"lucky\\" to have just been raped, as another young woman was murdered in the same spot just a short time earlier. Not feeling very \\"lucky,\\" Sebold proceeds to show how this incident of brutality and violence changed the course of her life.<BR>I have heard Alice Sebold speak on several occasions and greatly admire her candor, her honesty, and her insistence on calling rape by its true name. Bravo for this sere and scathing memoir by a remarkable woman and writer.
B000089RVX|2.0|The first couple of songs were worth a listen; however, by the fifth track, I noticed something...the songs are in EXACTLY the same key and the same subject matter is repeated incessantly - love and death.  By the end of the album, I was bored.  No doubt the album &quot;rocks&quot; at times, but there is nothing new or original here, just repetitious themes (both lyricially and musically).  I doubt if one year from now, I even bother to listen to the one or two tracks that were okay.  Buy the CD single &quot;Bring Me to Live&quot; and spare yourself the expense of purchasing the entire album, that way you won't have to listen to the various incarnations of the same song.
0385512104|5.0|When autistic 15-year-old Christopher Boone is wrongly accused of killing a frikkin' poodle, he decides to employ techniques of Sherlock Holmes' to track down the killer himself. In the process, difficult for anyone, but imagine trying to do it when you're autistic, he finds it necessary to navigate the emotional complexities of a social world that requires what must feel to him like swimming in molasses. From this improbable and potentially confusing premise comes a completely original work in a unique and compelling literary voice.<BR>Watch for this Mark Haddon guy; he's going places.
0312965788|5.0|I consider the characters in James Herriot's book to be among my best friends.  They have always had the ability to make me laugh or cry as I read about their exploits.  James Herriot wrote about his life in a way that should be a model for all of us as we live our lives.  His stories show a deep respect for all living things and a love for nature.  He was a keen observer of human relationships and an admirer of the essential traits that make us all tick.  Besides being all of these things, he was a masterful writer.  Each of his anecdotes ends with a satisfying clincher and his descriptions are rich enough that you can smell the Yorkshire pudding and feel the blistering wind.  He created in me such of love of that environment, that I went to &quot;Darrowby&quot; on my honemoon just to retrace his steps.  Do yourself a favor and read this book!
B00009PN1R|5.0|dont be so stupid to go buy an import album thats just like the original. Hail to the Thief was undoubtedly the years best album, but get the special edition that isn't an import, because this one is no different.
B000002L75|4.0|Yes, this is the in-between album.  Martin, Dave, Alan and Andy were ready to leave the cloyingly mindless sounds of A Broken Frame and Speak and Spell, while it was quickly acknowledged that a political career along the lines of Construction Time Again was not quite the right way to go either.<br />Having said that, sonically we still have many of the sampled, proto-industrial elements of Construction Time Again.  Some Great Reward thumps, bleeps, hisses and clicks like an army of appliances on PCP.  The crashing sound of \\"People Are People\\" is of course recognizable to many, but that song has been an embarrassment to DM for some time now because of its preachiness and naivete.  \\"Master and Servant\\" was meant mainly to be a thorn in the BBC's side, along the lines of Frankie Goes To Hollywood's popular song, \\"Relax.\\"  It is what it says it is: \\"disposable fun,\\" with an irreverent edge.  And of course there is \\"Blasphemous Rumours,\\" a song that is either utterly depressing or just another goth anthem to listen to while you dye your hair black, depending on your point of view.  It's meant to shock audiences and raise the hackles of parents and entertainment watchdogs.  Mission accomplished.  Fans of Nine Inch Nails (especially Pretty Hate Machine) who also like 80s music will take to this song very quickly and cherish it as their own.<br />But the best-known songs on Some Great Reward are not necessarily the best overall.  The cynical, elegant sexuality of \\"Lie to Me\\" speaks to a maturity that fleshes itself out on later albums like Violator and Music for the Masses; this song is kind of like \\"Policy of Truth\\" before the latter even existed.  It may be the best song on the album.  \\"If You Want\\" is also noteworthy, with its creepy, desolate intro leading into a more danceable sound.  Lyrically this song seems a little more at home on Construction Time Again (\\"Exercise your basic right / We could build a building site / From the bricks of shame is built a home\\"), but it sounds good here too.<br />If the span of Depeche Mode's work is a person, then Some Great Reward is that person's awkward adolescence.  For the most part, the juvenile traits are falling by the wayside (the cotton candy sound of \\"Dreaming of Me\\" or \\"New Life\\" is nowhere to be found here), and filling that void is a bleaker, more skeptical outlook on love and \\"life in general.\\"  This album is the beginning of good things for DM, and although it has a dated sound to it, it is a precognition of the Black Celebration era and beyond -- when Depeche Mode really found their footing musically and otherwise.  Strongly recommended (but not a must-have) for any serious DM fan, particularly if you like the older songs found on 101 and The Singles 81>85.t sounds good here too.  <br />If the span of Depeche Mode's work is a person, then Some Great Reward is that person's awkward adolescence.

B000083E79|5.0|CHER is the best ever in the whole wide world, period.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah is an amazing singer, and you really hear it in this cd. This cd is so relaxing, and soothing that it will calm anybody down. It is a very soft album with mostly ballads. I would highly suggest this cd to anybody.
0553213105|5.0|The reason I liked this book so much was the main character, Elizabeth Bennet.  Her honesty and spunk are a wonderful combination.  In a time where frankness was discouraged, hers grew.  I also admire how she matures through the course of the novel.  Her 'pride and prejudice' are put in their proper place.  Her and her father also contribute much humor to the story.  Their sarcastic wit made me laugh.  Generally, I enjoyed Austen's sense of humor: there were many funny moments.  I also found the story's end heartwarming... perhaps I am just a sap, but you should read it and find out!!!  I think this would be one of my favorite books so far; I definately want to read more Jane Austen in the coming months!!
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Okay I wrote a review before on this album giving it 5 stars but now i give it 3 stars because i got bored of this album. When you get this cd you will love it like I did but then after a couple of listens you might just start to get bored of it and listen to it less and less. Her magic she has on her songs start to die out. When I first got this album I was listening to it everyday without skiping songs then i started finding my self skiping more and more songs and finiding that there was no good song on this album so i havent listened to it for like 2 weeks now. If you want the magic to stay i suggest you listen to this album once a month. And im tired of people saying that this album is better than christina aguileras stripped album. Cause its not. Stripped is way more mature than this and it doesnt get boring like this one does, i've had stripped for a year now and i listen to it atleast once a week well not really once a week more like once every three days or so. Stripped has much more mature lyrics and sounds and i love it, so stop saying in the zone is way better than stripped. I LOVE CHRISTINA AGUILERA! You are the best! I can believe thoughts occured to me to become a britney fan i feel disgusted with myself.
B0000399WI|5.0|I figure most people reading these reviews have seen this movie, but they just want to know if their opinion is in synch with others. This has to be among the five best movies ever made. I honestly cannot think of one negative thing to say about this film.
B00006RU5B|5.0|in my honest opinion this is one of the best cds i have heard in a long time. the cd has explosive lyrics and music i have not exspearianced in few years. i think chris cornell brings something to the former ragers that the band strongly needed. this is coming from one of the biggest rage fans in the world. i honestly think that the only reason that this cd would recieve a bad review is if a few people who are living in the past are expecting a new RATM or soundgarden to suddly erupt out of audioslave. this is a HUGE mistake. when you listen to this phenominal cd dont think about all of the acomplishments that RATM and souindgarden have had in the past and just turn up the volume on your stereo, close your eyes, and exspearance the music for yourself. in conclusion if you have an open mind, and listen to the music, your rage will definatly be inslaved by this band.
0375703764|5.0|The other reviews listed here give a pretty good impression of what the book is: its layered plots, its broad scope, its unconventional conventions. And people love it or hate it. A surefire sign of great art is that it arouses passion, and whether that passion is in support of the work or in its derision is immaterial. That's my opinion, but be warned: House of Leaves certainly isn't for everyone.<br />There are a lot of people, traditionalists, die-hard Hawthorne and Melville fans, who will dismiss this novel as a pile of post-modernist putrescence. That's fine -- its very creative and pretty out-there, both in its concept and its approach. Those who do dare to pick it up, be sure to have about a week set aside to be consumed by this thing.<br />It's a dense book. Very dense. I have read it several times, very closely, and I know that I've only seen a third of what's there. Everything has something to do with something else -- there are no insignificant details, no fluff, in this book. And the overall effect of the plethora of STUFF here is remarkable.<br />You may not be sure of everything that's in there, but you intuit it. You start to get the feeling that Johnny Truant warns you about in the very beginning. As you give yourself over to the book, as you get absorbed into its world, Truant's paranoia creeps off the page and into the reader. It's scary because of the layers, and each voice's belief that the story it tells about is fiction; The Navidson house seems an awful dream, Zampanó approaches the film as fiction, Johnny doesn't know what to think -- he's just engrossed in this bizarre world, trying to put it all together and make sense of it, and &quot;The Editors&quot; raise questions as to whether Mr. Truant is even a real person. The reader, meanwhile, takes on much the same job as Johnny, trying to piece it all together, to find some hidden detail that will unlock these stories, tell us whether they really are fictional. As a reader, you start to doubt. The world gets that shimmer. And at the very end, you realize what's been going on. It's scary while it's happening, but ultimately it's pretty darn funny, as well; the real world is just another layer to this book.<br />The book asks more of the reader than any ordinary novel; you have to work with it, jump backwards and forwards to reacquaint yourself with some clue, read with a suspicious eye, sometimes set it aside and think on it. In the end, though, it's a gripping experience that's very repeatable and worthwhile. Like everything in the novel, there's something there -- it's just tough to put your finger on it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Ok. This is a reply to the Britney Spears is sooo much better... Ok, maybe at using the pop industry, but as far as vocals, there is few people who can touch christina's talent. Her voice is simply amazing. You may not like the clothes she wears, or what she does, but if you look past all of what she looks on the outside, you will find a wonderful artist, with a priceless voice. Stripped is a CD which just shows you how Christina can sing with any kind of beat and any genre. She is true to herself, and she doesn't care what you or anyone else says about her, not that she doesn't care about people, but because she believes in what she sings. I recommend anyone to listen to this CD and try to hate it, even my boyfriend confessed that if you listen to the CD everything about her songs are real, and real to lots of people around the world. This CD couldn't get any better. It's wonderful.

B0000VCZK2|3.0|Are the rumours true? I have the choice of either buying the region 1 collection or the region 2 collection. I want to buy the region 1 collection because I heard it has more special features than region 2 and I also prefer the cover of the region 1 collection. Is everyone having a problem with the trays falling out and is everyone experiencing problems with the director's cut of ALIEN. Please be honest so that I make a fair desicion. If you dont have any lock-up problems, please email me! Thanx
0930289234|4.0|This book's towering reputation is perhaps a bit overdone, and as a whole it is not Alan Moore's most satisfying work, but its richness can't be denied: multiple readings reveal details easily missed at first. At the same time, though, such further readings do emphasize a few limitations, namely a very even tone (despite the wide array of approaches used, both in the text itself and at the end of each chapter), a tendency to overstress some points (which dilutes the sheer power of certain events) and a somewhat unbalanced structure that hinders the last tier. Its novelty lies more in its massive stature than in its themes: a world has been created in Watchmen's pages, with elaborate codes that remain true from the beginning to the conclusion. There's a very high sense of cohesion, not only in the story but also between the writing and the art, to the point where it becomes difficult to isolate one from the other as the project's driving force - Watchmen is as much Gibbons' book as it is Moore's. In the end, both its weaknesses and numerous strenghts have a lot to do with the series' important lenght. More than read or watch this book, one experiences it. And whatever its shortcomings may be, that experience (and the characters depicted - especially Dr. Manhattan, whose 'solo issues', #3-4, are the most intriguing) can't be forgotten.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesday's With Morrie is an inspirational book above all. Morrie was a college professor who had befriended a student named Mitch Albom. Mitch had learned a lot about friends, family, and just life in general from Morrie. They always met on Tuesdays after Morrie's classes; that were, until the day Mitch graduated. He promised he would stay in touch with Morrie and never did. Sixteen Years later, Morrie is diagnosed with a life-threatening disease that slowly eats away at his body.<BR>One night, while Mitch was having difficulty sleeping, he flips through the channels on his television and comes across Morrie being interviewed on TV. Mitch gets on a plane and goes to see Morrie. They get reacquainted and realize that their friendship never really died. <BR>From then on, until the end of the biography, Morrie and Mitch meet every Tuesday where Morrie teaches Mitch about the real important things in life.
B000059XUO|5.0|I didn't know he was the kid of Bruce Lee. The whole fact that I waited to see this movie on encore really depresses me. My dad told me to get out when he was watching it on dvd a long time ago. I never got to see it until now. This movie is awesome.<br />The first thing you will probably notice is the set. It's probably one of the best ever done next to lord of the rings, possibly even better. Everything is gothic and such. You will mabye feel comfortable in the setting once(in the little girls house) but thats basically it.<br />Anyways, this dead rockstar comes back to life to avenge his death and the death/rape of his girlfriend. He sets out on revenge and he basically is the perfect combination of good and evil.<br />As for the other reviews. The movie is good. I saw that most of the reviews have 0 out of 2 or 0 out of 1. That is because 2 people who hate violent movies decided to make everyone's reviews look bad. This movie is awesome. Every review should be 5 stars. Action, drama, a little humor, and the best set designs make this an above-average action film that is a true classic.
B000002L5I|1.0|While the first KWS release showed promise, this sophmore effort serves up nothing more than rehashed texas guitar slinger crap-ola.<br />Wake up people!!! SRV has left the building.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Everyone is dogging this album for being lyrically and musically disappointing.  I personally think it is nice to see DT branching off and attempting a sound they hadn't tried before.  Yes it is much heavier than their past albums, but in my opinion the music is still very complex and well thought out.  For those who are comparing ToT to Metallica of old, do you remember how revolutionary And Justice for All was?  My only complaint is that I do agree that Jordan Rudess seems left out of this one and that is a shame considering his prowess on the keyboards. I do, however feel that this was put to good use by showcasing some new chops that John Petrucci seems to have picked up from Satriani or Vai.  And of course, Mike Portnoy is as lethal as always.  I give this one two big thumbs of for stepping out of the box and creating something we have not experienced from DT.
B000002I2G|5.0|It just goes to show you that you can't let some negative reviews keep you from hearing something that you might enjoy. Now I can definately see where some people would not enjoy this album. I mean, they've got an entire orchestra in there on some songs. What was Morrison thinking???<br />For me, this is one of my favorite albums. Period. I love how Soft Parade builds and builds into a screaming cresendo. Shaman's Blues displays the absolute best of Morrison's vocal talents. Wishful Sinful is a tad corny but a great song, nontheless. My point is, if you like the Doors, try it out. Listining to this album may not change your life, but there are enough quality tunes to make it worth your while.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Several people have commented that Dylan is worse than Justin Timberlake and, though I disagree, I would have to argue that he is worse than many other singers, including Robin Zander of Cheap Trick. That said, Highway 61 has many songs on it that are quite good despite the primitive recording technology. Recommended.
185984054X|4.0|If you're looking for the case against Mother Teresa, this is not it. Christopher Hitchens's purpose was narrower, and intelligently so. The Missionary Position is only an indictment of Mother Teresa.<br />But don't let that &quot;only&quot; fool you. What Hitchens does superbly here is wonder, quite persuasively, &quot;Why hasn't anyone ever questioned this woman?&quot; He alleges sufficient particularized facts to create a reasonable doubt about the means and ends of someone whose saintliness has always been taken for granted. Hithchens's charges are compelling enough to make you conclude discovery and a wider investigation are necessary, but he never carries out a full-on prosecution.<br />Besides consorting with unsavory characters (and taking their money), Mother Teresa's greatest trespass, according to Hitchens, was accepting the mantle of compassionate caretaker of the poor, while harboring a philosophy that celebrates suffering and does little for the poor but let them wretch, surreptitiously convert them, and let them die so that they might go to heaven. Meanwhile, her well-to-do patrons in the developed world sleep well at night after having written her a check, knowing that they have done good. Her unbending opposition to any contraception also doesn't win her any points in Hitchens's scorecard, but what does he expect from a Catholic nun?<br />If you believe in God, you might take offense to how easily and unapologetically Hitchens dismisses any notions of a creator or afterlife or other mysticisms. But if this is the case, I don't think this book was written for you; I think he wrote this book assuming (at the very least) an informed secularism on the part of the reader. As always, Hitchens proves to be a good and interesting writer, and I recommend this book.
B0000C1733|3.0|What makes me happy is there are quite a few songs that I love on this CD. What makes me unhappy are the songs left off. &quot;Zephyr Song&quot;, &quot;Dosed&quot;, and &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, to name just three. Sure, the first and third of those made the DVD, but I would've loved to have them included in the CD, even if it had to have 20+ tracks just to include them. I'm going to have to make another trip just to pick up By The Way, and I don't like doing that. The true plus of this CD is &quot;Fortune Faded&quot;, which is a catchy and cool song.<br />The only way I can figure that &quot;Universally Speaking&quot; could've made the CD would be the &quot;God Put a Smile on Your Face&quot; method: the song would've had to be released just after &quot;Dosed&quot;, but be overshadowed by &quot;Fortune Faded&quot;, and thus not played. (&quot;God Put a Smile on Your Face&quot; is an excellent Coldplay song, released as a single just after &quot;The Scientist&quot;, but overshadowed by &quot;Moses&quot;, which was released at the same time, thus resulting in &quot;Moses&quot; being favored and played more...unfortunately, only one band in recent memory has perfected the art of multiple yet distinct singles, and that's Good Charlotte, as much as I hate to say it)<br />Anyways, as another review somewhere on here said, if you're picky about your singles and already have the CDs that really matter (BSSM, Californication, By The Way), steer clear. Even though RHCP do have too many good singles to properly include on a greatest hits CD, I think that more thought could've gone into the track listing.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Anyone who saw X-Men 1 and then 2 can clearly see the improvements made and that X-2 is better, no denying it this time around. I think what hurt X-men 1 is that the special effects werent as good as X2 although the storyline was strong. From start to finish there was action, drama, mystery and storyline within storylines. I think the directors main goal with this was to make it watchable and &quot;easy to relate&quot; to someone who has never followed the Xmen series before. Being that I have (Also a big Xmen fan), I payed close attention to how close the charaters followed thier actual description in the comic books. There are so many underlying messages brought up by the story line like discrimination, faith, religion, Trust, and Humanity. The main one being discrimination which many people can relate to. The intro is one of the coolest parts of the movie that takes nightcrawler to a whole different dimension. Overall they took Xmen to a whole different level with this one. Special Effects, Story line, the in-depth conflicts shown within each character, and timing of it all makes for a good movie. The ending alone is all you need to know that a Part 3 is definetly coming and from what i saw(phoniex), and the story and special effects are only about to get even better.<br />Get It!
B0000019PA|1.0|Alot of people want and like to say this album/band are really good, but the truth is, it/they are not really that good. It is a very bland album. Basically a modern version of The Beatles entire catalogue, only without all the genius that those songwriters had. People really need to stop saying albums are good just because the &quot;style&quot; is good. This songwriting is just not that good. It's an album just like all the other albums it is comparable to, by the bands they are comparable to. Albums by the shins, and apples in stereo: boring albums that sound sort of like modern kids influenced by a mix of The Beatles and Punk Rock, with a couple good pop songs somewhere on the record. Much, much better pop and rock records have been made over the last 40 years that people should by before ever buying anything like this. sorry.
B0000E6XKF|5.0|The Red Hopt Chili Peppers have become one of, if not the greatest live performers of today. This dvd captures the red hot chili peppers at the peak of their musical careers, and is a necesity for any red hot chili pepeprs fans.  Although not listed, there are jams/solos inbetween the listed titles that show off their amazing musical talent.   After &quot;give it away&quot; there is a break before they came out for the encore where chad comes out and plays a solo and flea comes out and palys trumpet with him.  They did this many times on the By The Way tour and seeing them live was an amazing experience.  I definitly recommend you get this dvd, it is jam packed with all of their greatest songs and its definitly one of the better live dvds out there, far exceeding their previous live dvd, &quot;Off The Map.&quot;
B000065V1V|5.0|Heathen is something that needs to be played again and again and again.  The music, lyrics, and &quot;guest&quot; musicians are perfectly written and chosen.  The best is the second cd with the Moby remixes.  Get this now.

B000001F6T|3.0|While Alvin Lee and Ten Years After made several classic albums in the early to mid seventies (Cricklewood Green, A Space in Time, Rock and Roll Music to the World and Live at the Fillmore are some of the best Rock albums of all time), this was one of their first and it shows. The songs are not great, but it isn't bad like some of the other reviewers seem to think. Comapre it to the later efforts and Stonedhenge shows how Alvin and the band evolved in to the greatest forgotten band of all.
B00003CXI1|3.0|This film is a case of if you don't know the story, you will have questions all through the film and or miss some points.<br />I was one of those rare people who hadn't read any of the books till this year.<br />Now that I read the books, the film could have been much better!<br />I thought Dumbledore was a guy that you wondered if he was either insane or the supreame genious.  Richard Harris(God rest him) came off as a little too grandfatherly for my vision of the character.<br />I thought Snape was right on as was Mcgonical(sp) and somewhat Hagrid.<br />The children were almost there.  I kind of thought Harry had a bit of the smart A-- to him which Danial did not portray.<br />Hermione was supposed to be the busybody knowitall and that almost came across.<br />Ron and the twins were good!<br />Overall if you read the books, it is a fun film.
B000000WG4|5.0|To start of with to state what it says on the box &quot;this can't be played on old tin boxs&quot;this is true. It sounds and feels alot better if you play it on an analog valve system this is proper 3d music
B00003CX5P|2.0|I was extreamly excited when the film was announced.  I remembered the first three and was looking forward to this!<br />A big disappointment!  George now seems to think that if we wow them with special effects then the story line does not matter.  This film proved him wrong.<br />I don't subscribe to the &quot;hey how does technology look better then the first three films&quot;  since a great story line will smash a beautiful film.<br />The characters had awsome potential!  JarJar the exception of course.<br />I found young Anakin a little too great and thought the emaculate conception idea was a little trite.  And I felt the queen seemed to be comming on to Anakin rather then &quot;Aren't you cute&quot; response.<br />The best part of the whole film was the the light saber fight between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon.<br />George gave a great villian and then killed him off!<br />The film failed due to the poor story line.  George tried to wow people with the race which was long and looked interesting but he it took away from the story line.<br />I hoped the next installment would recover but it doesnt.<br />The DVD itself has some nice stuff added but unless you are a real fan of the genra, you might avoid it.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|I must agree with the &quot;One With the Crowd&quot; review for the most part - <BR>But did not ANYONE read the insert &quot;Flying Down to Rio - Leaving Vapor Trails Behind&quot; by Neil?? It explains much of why things are the way they are, and how this historic recording  was almost not, including Rush! <BR>Considering the definition of the instruments that comes  through on the recording, in my experience based on recording and doing live sound and given they had played in a driving rain the show before, then dealing with rain soaked gear, the result is absolutely astounding. To play to a &quot;heaving, waving, singing, dancing, sweating mass of humanity&quot; as Neil described it, I think this release puts you smack dab in the middle of the crowd better than any live recording I have ever heard - hat's off to the whole crew! If you gotta play the blame game for any flaws, blame it on nature, but give credit to 3 guys who far exceed most in dedication,  creativity, humor and the fact they stayed together through the worst of times creating a music legacy that will live long after they are gone. Today's music groups can only hope to achieve a fraction of what makes a band like Rush what they are - a legend.<BR>I'm waiting delivery of the DVD, so I'll address my thought on video when I get it - I expect all the crying about technical flaws are far over rated given the general public couldn't tell the difference and after all that's what matters in marketing a product such as this. <BR>If you want a studio mix, listen to the albums. If you want a live recording that puts you in the front row, get this CD!!<br />It was great to hear that Alex can still sing! LOL!!<BR>And yes, the world most expressive bass player Geddy Lee always &quot;plucks the living hell out of his bass&quot; defying age!!<BR>As for Neil's kit , ever sat behind or played a &quot;cyborg&quot; kit? An absolute humbling &quot;new millennium&quot; experience!<BR>For their age, Rush still spank the little baby butts of today's acts! <br />&quot;Rush&quot; a name befitting the legend!<br />Plus ça change, Plus c'est la meme chose!
6304711905|2.0|I thought that the movie was okay and I'm being generous when I say that...The movie went on and on and just when I thought I was going to puke.Val Kilmer shows up still trying to die from Tuberculosis.It just got old after a while.
B000089RVX|5.0|Trying to decide whether to buy &quot;Fallen&quot;?  I'm almost 50 y.o. and like selections from Switched on Bach to Jethro Tull to Benny Goodman to Michelle Branch ... you get the picture.<br />&quot;Fallen&quot; is terrific: fat high-distortion chords in familiar progressions on electric guitar, sometimes backed by a wonderful choir, and led by full power female vocals that soar.  The rhythms are familiar to alternative and hard rock fans, with variations that catch and please you.  It's fabulous to immerse into this music -- and study the lyrics to divine their subtle meanings ...<br />One thing I liked:  the electric bass is, for the most part, *not* loaded with distortion ... and thus stands apart with its own creative musical line, giving the songs just a little less of the heavy effect. Also nice is the piano that wanders in and out of songs with seemingly improvised figures, just under the surface.<br />Someone pointed out that &quot;Fallen&quot; contains songs that are similar or repetitive, in instrumentation, rhythms, effects, vocal lines, and lyrical themes.  At first I was inclined to agree ... though I remained quite willing to rock out repetitively :-)<br />It occurred to me, however, that the CD is not a collection of &quot;songs&quot;  -- it is a *suite* -- and when understood that way, the common elements interconnect the pieces, just as do the repeating themes and structures in any of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, Handel's Water Music, or nearly any of Vivaldi's popular works.<br />So, that point having been established, I feel entirely justified to<br />TURN IT UP LOUD !
B00005JKWI|5.0|Blade 2 is awesome. Blood,weapons,vampires oh my! Blade is even less remorse to vampires than the first movie. Vampires getting cut up and split up! I would recommed this movie to anyone who likes a movie that has alot of action and a tiny bit of horror in them!
B0000025C0|5.0|Close on the heels of their record-breaking debut release, Boston followed up with this highly successful sequel cd.  Although not as critically acclaimed as the &quot;Boston&quot; album, &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; is very good in its own right.  Once again, Brad Delp's incredible vocals shine through on the title track as well as my favorites &quot;Its Easy&quot; and &quot;Feelin Satisfied&quot;.  The late 70s and early 80s was the era of the great arena rock bands, and Boston was at the top of the list.  This is a first-rate cd with searing guitars and top notch keyboards from Tom Scholz and the boys.  Buy this great cd and take a trip back in time to the great arena rock days.

B0000AK7AG|5.0|Babe, a little piglet lives on a farm.  He becomes friends with all of the other animals that live on the farm also.  He has quite a personality for such a little pig.  The family that owns the farm intend to make him their holiday dinner, but this brave little pig shows that he can heard sheep.  And he becomes a very loved and needed pig (quite an asset to the man and his wife).<br />This little pig becomes quite a legend and is respected by all.  This movie will warm your heart and soul and should be in everyone's home library.  After you see this movie, you will look at pigs in a different way.  As animals that are very sensitive, smart, cute and cuddly.  This little pig will remind you of your favorite pet, whether it be a dog or cat.  Babe is a movie to be enjoyed for many years to come and one that you will want to watch over and over again and not get bored.  Babe is a movie that will go down in history and gives pigs the respect that they so deserve.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has a heart and soul.  Those who don't, will truly miss out on such a wonderful film....

B0000AXE8I|1.0|And so, Hollywood greed swallows another would-be classic. If you take both Reloaded and Revolutions, cut out all the pointless eye candy you would have a worthy successor. The bulk of Reloaded is nothing but over choreographed, completely plot unrelated video game like fight scenes. Why do this Wachowski? Why sell your soul to Silver? Or did you?<br />I felt like crap watching this movie, and I really wish I hadn't. I am going to go to a hypnotherapist and get him to convince me that I have never seen this trite torment of a film, just so I can enjoy the first one as I always have. I am not just disappointed because the second film is slightly worse than the first. It's so pathetically bad I wanna cry.<br />In the first film every single scene meant something. Everything was a precursor to something else. When Neo fights smith in the subway, it's a lead-up to him waking up to the realities of the matrix. When Morpheus fights smith in the bathroom, he is sacrificing himself to save his crew and fulfills the prophecy Oracle made. Everything is connected somehow. But what do we get in Reloaded? We get Neo flying and fighting quadrillion agents, for the sake of flying and fighting quadrillion agents. Only at the very end of the movie do you get that same feeling of mystery, of something important, something significant is about to take place. It feels like the first movie again... and then you see \\"To Be Continued\\".<br />Oh and the dialog. Morpheus delivers lines with such incredible intensity and depth that you actually think he has something important to say. He doesn't. It's so pretentious it was almost insulting. He might as well come into a dark room, wearing sunglasses, and say: \\"I... had... waffles! For breakfast this morning\\" in his slow deliberating tone, it would have been just as deep as most of what he had to say.<br />I loved the first movie, I watched it at least a hundred times as it was set looping on my DVD player for a month straight at one time. I saw Reloaded and couldn't believe what a sad excuse for a Matrix sequel it was. Based on what I've heard I will never pay to see Revolutions.
B00005JL3A|4.0|This movie is great! You have a virus sweeping up a whole entire building turning everyone into a zombie! This movie is better than the Resident Evil 1 or 2 video games. One of the most fantastic parts in this movie is when the four or five officers get trapped in a room where a laser is coming straight from the walls in a straight line killing everyone inside. After only one is left in there he dodges like 2 lasers, then he thinks its done but he's wrong the straight laser suddenly spreads out in a enormous square with tiny squares in the middle and he says, &quot;That can't be good!&quot; And he's right his body gets cut up<BR>into tiny little squares.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I know that it probably has been said by thousands of folks but lets say it one more time. Lonesome Dove is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made. EVER. Robert Duvall as, no make that Robert Duvall is Gus McCrae and Tommy Lee Jones is Captain Woodrow F. Call. They embark on a 2500 mile cattle drive from Texas to Montana to set up ranch and be cattlemen. Gus is the kind that likes to play cards and get pokes and Call is all about business. They were Texas Rangers together in the old days and have a friendship that we all wish we could have. Along with Jake Spoon, Deets, Newt, Dish and the very underrated Tim Scott as Pea Eye they go and re steal horses from the Mexicans and then head on their way to Montana. Gus is not thrilled about going but is on the trip for only one reason. To go and see his long lost love Clara Allen. Along the way you are introduced to the Indian outlaw Blue Duck, who has alluded Call and McCrae from their days as rangers, Sheriff July Johnson and his deputy Rosco along with other great characters. Every actor or actress who played in Lonesome Dove seems custom made for the part they play.  In this movie you have some of the best supporting roles in movie history. You have Diane Lane as Lorie, Barry Tubb as Jasper Fant, Leon Singer as Bolivar the cook from Lonesome Dove, D.B. Sweeney, in one of the best character developments, as Dish Boggett, Rick Schroeder as Calls unclaimed son Newt and many others who are just as important to the story but just to many to name. The ones above are the major characters through out the whole movie.   I really don't have the time and space to tell you about all the great things about this movie so you will need to set aside 6 hours and sit back and enjoy the greatest movie ever made.
0156027321|4.0|Lili Bentley<BR>Life of Pi<br />     The family of a young boy named Pi, sets off for Toronto from India. They own a zoo in India and have sold all the animals to different places all over the world. Pi's family boards a Japanese cargo ship with all the animals and head for Canada, but they don't get far. In less then two weeks the ship sinks and Pi is stranded in a lifeboat with a tiger, a zebra, a hyena, and an orangutan. Pi has many hardships along his life in the lifeboat, for instants finding food, but Pi survives. And as strange as this may seem the tiger actually helps Pi survive on the lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Life of Pi has aspects that make it wonderful and other aspects that I didn't enjoy as much. <BR>     This book opened me up to different religions. Pi becomes involved with Islam, Hinduism and Christian. I liked this part of the book because it taught me new aspects of the different religions that I didn't know. It was interesting how Pi had different parts of each religion intertwined with his life. I also enjoyed the part of the story when he tells the reader how he survives on the lifeboat. For example when he tells us about him catching fish. Another aspect I enjoyed was the way the story never became boring. I never thought that something was going on for too long or that something was boring. I didn't think the time of the lifeboat was too long because something interesting is always happening. <BR>     There is also a part of this book that was not as interesting and enjoyable. Life of Pi is a little confusing. In some points in the book you don't know whither Pi was talking to himself or another real person. This is the only complaint I can think of that wasn't compelling and exciting about Life of Pi.  I would defiantly recommend people to journey into the life of Pi, this amazing young boy.
B00009XITP|5.0|This is one of the best Cinderella-based stories I have ever seen! <br />Amanda Bynes portrays a 17-year-old American girl who has lived her entire life without a father, or even a fatherly figure. When she turns 17, she realizes that she is missing half of her, and decides to give in to what she really wants: a father. Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) crosses the Atlantic to see Daddy Dearest.  She finds out that her father is Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), high in political power and also engaged.  Daphne quickly discovers that this is almost no different from her own Cinderella story.  There's the evil step-mother [almost, since she's not married to Henry yet], Glynnis who only wants to be married to Henry for political power.  Her daughter, Clarissa is the evil step-sister who only wants a title and recognition.  Clarissa and Glynnis both try to stand in the way of Daphne getting her father to go with his conscience, instead of the politics.  <br />This is a really sweet movie, I'd say for all ages.  If you enjoy this movie, then I would highly recommend the following: The Parent Trap (G), any Cinderella movie, or Cinderella-based synopsis, The Princess Diaries (G), Big Fat Liar (PG), and Agent Cody Banks (PG).
B00008J2DQ|5.0|GODSMACK is so awesome! I love this cd as well as their others. This is by far my favorite though. It has a much harder edge than their others in the past. They have went to more of a Metallica type of playing and they can pull it off better than anyone ever could. I hope they stick with this formula because it rocks hard. Even the 2 ballads at the end are great. &quot;I F*CKING HATE YOU&quot; is my favorite song this band has ever put out. Buy this album!
B000002504|4.0|With new drummer John Weathers, who would remain with the band right to the end, Gentle Giant released their fourth album, 1973's &quot;Octopus.&quot; It's another slice of GG's intricate &quot;acquired taste&quot; sort of progressive rock, but for those who are open to it--like me--it's great stuff. The band get some good jams in on tracks like &quot;The Advent Of Panurge,&quot; &quot;Knots,&quot; &quot;The Boys Of The Band,&quot; and &quot;River,&quot; as well as showing their softer side on the lovely, ballady &quot;Think Of Me With Kindness.&quot; The band's musicianship is tight, the vocals are excellent. All in all, &quot;Octopus&quot; is yet another fine prog-rock album from the daring Gentle Giant.
B0000844IT|5.0|It's probably the Greatest Movie Ever Made... and it stunned critics across the land!  On its release, few people knew what to make of it, and for a Dino Di Laurentis production, its promotion and release were rather limited.<br />One critic from \\"People\\" magazine dismissed the film as abhorrent and complained about the character Ash killing \\"an old lady\\" with a sawed-off shotgun. Talk about being misunderstood, that takes the cake.<br />Years later, it's the cult favorite that keeps winning new beleivers.<br />\\"Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness\\" is a classic comedy of errors, one of my top ten favorites of all time.  Nothing about this film can be taken seriously.<br />If you don't have a good sense of humor, you'll dismiss this film as a lot of schlock, which basically, it is.  However, it's also high camp.  Bruce Campbell, an astonishing comic actor, creates the persona of Ash by systematically giving an excellent impersonation of himself, which is very amusing.  Embeth Williams is also good as Sheila.<br />Sam Raimi does an excellent job of stringing a lot of silliness together and making it work, but it's Campbell, as sort of a failed Jimmy Stewart type, who really carries the film.<br />The alternate endings are great.  While I like the \\"Back to the Future\\" ending, I'm not sure that it would have worked that well as a sequel.  As a purist, I think the final cut of the movie, complete with K-Mart ending is the better of the two.<br />If you don't have a sense of humor, you won't appreciate this movie for what it is.  Thanks, Sam and Bruce!

0790729342|4.0|Despite what one reviewer said, the widescreen version on this disc is true widescreen. I am guessing that the reviewer did not watch beyond the first five menutes, which is in reduced full-screen mode as it was originally shot for the cinema.<br />One the down side, this is not the full-length European version which is around a minute longer and has a more graphic boomerang scene, rape/murder scene, and chase scene at the end.<br />It's worth the $10 I paid for it, even though it is the original US release version.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Every artist has their musical peaks and valleys.  Mclachlan's &quot;Surfacing&quot; was a watershed event in her career.  Her life's changed from the response to the album, and from personal growth and new beginnings in her family.  She doesn't disappoint me here, just doesn't begin to reach the apex that was &quot;Surfacing&quot;.  Although I agree with others that &quot;Fallen&quot; is the best song on the CD, I can't get &quot;Train Wreck&quot; outta my head after weeks and weeks with the CD.  &quot;Push&quot; is revealing and satisfying, and the only real song I continuously skip while playing the CD is &quot;Stupid&quot; (need I say more?).  Lush backgrounds on each of the tracks, a focus on soft percussion from her hubby....Sarah has another winner here.<br />Definitely a keeper....
B00005JKC3|1.0|Perhaps I was distracted the night I watched the movie.  Perhaps it was all of the pseudo-scientific jargon.  Perhaps it was the cheesy &quot;comic book frame&quot; technique that Ang Lee seemed to use ad nauseum throughout the film.  Whatever it was, the film did not resonate with me at all the way I thought it would.  <br />Eric Bana displays the range of a turnip as Bruce Banner.  He has a total of three expressions throughout the film: vacant, morose, and angry, and tends to remain in the first through most of the film.  I grew up watching Bill Bixby &quot;hulk out&quot; into Lou Ferrigno, and for all the cheesiness of the series, I'd take it any day over this overblown piece of cinematic fluff.  <br />This film is painfully slow and pathetically written.  If you haven't seen it already, save your money for the X-Men or Spiderman franchises--they know how to do comic book action properly.
0345452577|1.0|I, too, have been very into the Alex Delaware novels and was so excited about this one coming out.  I was also disappointed when I found out it had a new main character (after I checked the book out), but was willing to give it a fair chance.  I had to fight to stay awake almost 100 pages into this book, as it went nowhere!  Arthur Chess is such a pointless character and the conversations they have are as boring as a forced lecture in college.  Bottom line, if you have not read the previous books with Alex in them, go back a few in the series and read those.  Save yourself the time on this one!
6305263248|5.0|This film has the best ultra high speed pursuits I've ever seen on film. Bullit, Vaninshing Point, French Connection all taken exponentially higher. The video and sound editing are phenomenal.  The driving and sound are as real as the sound editing in the shootout in Heat.
B0000009S3|3.0|If you regard of the early sixties in the USA, this rock and roll/blues rock album was already quite progressive, even though in some circumstances only..that is you can get an inkling of his talent, which will be developed better in the future.In fact tracks such as &quot;Don 'Sugarcane'&quot;,&quot;Harris&quot; or &quot;Willie the Pimp&quot;, are a tasteful example of things to come later (listen to the experimental album &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot;)...well these songs actually are almost equal to the most disappointing version of &quot;Gumbo Variations&quot;, which is more similar;nevertheless there are some stunning spare classic breaks through (of course I remark these latter as &quot;classic&quot;, regarding of his usual high standard).Moreover some of the themes will appear on other albums such as the &quot;Grand Wazoo&quot; and &quot;Waka Jawaka&quot;; while perhaps the song &quot;Son of Mr. Green Genes&quot; is the only one which is not much inspiring...it never minds, this work, not completely mature, is anyway worth checking out at least!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|While the extra footage in the extended edition of FOTR was nice, particularly the additional Shire footage and the gifts of Galadriel (I'm still not sure how they could justify cutting THAT section), I was left with the feeling that while it was nice to see, it didn't add that much value over the theatrical version.  Consequently, after multiple viewings of the theatrical version, I was not certain that TTT could be improved by adding additional footage.  I am happy to say that I was dead wrong.<br />Not only does the additional footage add some nice back stories that help the viewer to clarify motive (e.g., Faramir's stormy relationship with Denethor), it makes the overall fabric of the movie richer.  Tolkein purists may quibble over the artistic license that Peter Jackson has taken on certain plot points and characters, but in my opinion, most of the changes he has made were necessary to translate the books to film.   I had trouble getting through the book TTT because of the way the story was subdivided.  <br />For example, Jackson wisely distills Merry and Pippin's time with the Ents into a few key scenes that last far too many pages in Tolkein's novel.  Jackson also wisely minimizes the time we see Frodo and Sam crawling through rocky outcroppings and walking across the countryside.  For a visual medium, hobbits walking through a forest or crawling up a mountain are just not that interesting.  Instead, Jackson invests a significant amount of time where it belongs, with Aragorn at Helm's Deep, thus setting up the final film nicely. <br />Since this review is being written before the release of ROTK, I can only say that I hope the final installment is as good as the first two, and I cannot wait to completely the DVD trilogy with both the theatrical and extended editions of ROTK.  These are movies that can be watched time and again and never become tiresome.  I do not mean to sound like a raving fanboy for the LOTR trilogy, but I am very glad that Peter Jackson and New Line took the time to do the films and the DVDs properly!
0385504209|1.0|I was very excited to read this book, as I had heard many excellent things about it.  However, everything about it after just a few chapters was disappointing.  The characters were flat, the plot was highly predictable, and the writing style left much to be desired.  My only guess is that this book is selling on the sensationalism of the secret society.  If you're looking for worthwhile reading, this isn't it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I've been a big big fan of Brit ever since she came up with Baby one more time in 1998. I was damn upset when I heard she's changing her style of music to hip hop in October. But I bought it becuase I was a britney fan and I listened to it very reluctantly. Almost everyone will find some song they like. There's a big variety and I loved each and every song. It's very sad to see that people who hate her don't want to give her new music a chance. Madonna and Britney sucK?? Madonna's legend and Brit's on her way to become one. You should give this CD a chance and buy it.
B0000009SE|4.0|It's difficult to appreciate it at its first listen, but after being in the habit with his experimental stuff, this album can be essential in every &quot;prog collection&quot;, even though the whole material is a bit out of such &quot;progressive genre&quot;...I suggest you to listen to every song carefully, and then you can enter his magical world more easily!! <BR>Recommended!!
B00005Q4CS|2.0|Ok, after hearing things about this movie such as &quot;The most realistic depiction of drug addiction ever!&quot; and &quot;Number 1 movie of 2000&quot; I decided to pick up this &quot;Masterpeice&quot; and after viewing this 102 minutes of eyes dilating..I decided something..I do not like this movie.<br />Ok, to start off with, I was under the impression this was supposed to be completely realistic. Off the top of my head I can think of quite a few scenes that I feel have insulted my intelligence, for instance:<br />The constant shots of pupils dilating as the characters are shooting heroin..I may not know a whole lot about heroin..but im pretty sure it causes your eyes to contract, not dilate!<BR>Also, when Harry and Tyrone arrive at the hospital and Harry's arm is practically rotting off, what does the doctor do? He calls the police and they are sent off to prison. Would a doctor really do this? Especially without treating him first? What a load.<br />Oh yeah, I didn't know that when they amputate your arm blood splatters all over your face, all yeah, and you're still conscious!<br />Well ok, a movie does not have to be completely realistic for me. But what it does have to be is at least a little fun or interesting to watch. This movie was neither; I didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. There was no development, just some stupid druggies, they never showed there family lives, except for the exception of Harry. The only character I felt the least bit sorry for was the mom, that was the only story, which I thought, was the least bit effective. I mean come on is a bunch of flashes (The exact same flashes, at that) of dollar bills rolled up and eyes dilating supposed to shock me? Maybe I'm just more into slower paced movies that allow time for character development and explain things more. Almost this whole film is shot in hyperspeed..It's just a mess of quick flashes, and that does not excite me. If you want to see a good, realistic drug movie, watch Trainspotting or Traffic.
B000000OQF|5.0|This album is a classic package of 80's hard rock. <BR>\\"Apetite For Destruction\\" is everything a great rock record should be. Here's a song by song synopsis:<br />1. Welcome To The Jungle: A great way to open the album. A story about the terrors of hollywood. 10/10<BR>2. It's So Easy: The classic bad-ass attitude song full of blistering drums, growling vocals, and searing guitars. 10/10.<BR>3. Nightrain: Booze-soaked rock n roll at it's best. Catchy guitar hook, and good vocals. 10/10.<BR>4. Out Ta Get Me - A rocking tune about hiding from either the law, or any other enemies that may be on Axls' tail. 9/10.<BR>5. Mr. Brownstone: Catchy, rockin', awsome. What more can I say? One of the best songs here. 10/10.<BR>6. Paradise City: What more can I say but AWSOME. 10/10.<BR>7. My Michelle: Catchy chorus, nice calm intro, which explodes into a barrage of distorted guitars and thundering drums. 10/10.<BR>8. Think About You: Vastly underrated, yet not as good as the other songs here. Still, don't skip it. 8/10.<BR>9. Sweet Child O' Mine: Probably the song that most people know them for. Awsome song, beautiful guitar riff. 10/10.<BR>10. You're Crazy: Another underrated one. This is a good tune, and is not a filler, or anything like that at all. 8.7/10<BR>11. Anything Goes: Clearly a song about sex. But what do you expect with Axl Rose? Good song, but not the best. 7.9/10<BR>12. Rocket Queen - Groovy riff, great vocals, goes from sleazy rock song to almost gentle, Sweet Child O Mine-ish ending. A great way to close the album. 10/10.<br />So there you have it, a classic piece of music, 12 rocking tunes<BR>that have helped define the course of hard rock in the early 90's up until today. My suggestion: BUY IT!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD has been in my CD player for weeks.  It's one of the only CDs that I actually like more than one or two songs on, in fact I like every song.
B0000009SF|3.0|This is a jazz-fusion album,with a classical orientation, which is quite similar to that one of &quot;Hot Rats&quot;,although it is a bit lighter in tone, despite of containing such odd instrumentation like horns and woodwinds...well these latter were not present within &quot;Hot rats&quot; and for this reason at last I prefer the present one (or anyway in some circumstances at least).The track &quot;Eat That Question&quot; is brilliant, but there are also other simply structured and remarkable songs. Sometimes this &quot;Eat That Question&quot; reminds me indeed of the memorable job at the electric piano and organ as well within some classic jazz albums, in the vein of George Duke;the whole job is filtered through a personal style of his own, thanks also to his wah-wah guitar-effect and some other strange tunes. The whole album is mostly instrumental, with a very few inspiring and less inspiring songs, such as &quot;Blessed Relief&quot;, which concludes the album in a simplistic and easy listening manner , but it never minds... <BR>This work is recommended, even though it is not completely essential!!
0061015725|5.0|My grandma gave this to me Thanksgiving 2003, and I was skeptical because I had never read a Chrichton book before.  Well, I started reading it and I was quickly lured in this thrilling story of a Tech firm gone mad.  The character of Jack is easily appealing and his suspicions of his wife makes a great double-plot story.  And remember: things never turn out the way you think they will...
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The soundtrack for the final installment of this series is by far one of the greatest sounding musical scors ever created. The Return of the King has not yet come to the big screen but it will soon. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum will reach Mt. Doom. Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf will test their might in one final encounter with evil on Pelennor Fields. Merry and Pippin will also find their strength and courage. The album starts innocently enough and leaves own frantically trying to figure out what is happening but in the case of this album that plays perfectly to Howard Shore's image. This album is by far a tour de force in fast paced listening. The War of the Ring reaches its peak and there will be one victor. Thus music in this album does not hold to any of the old themes except for one which is a very welcome sight but I won't spoil it for the reader. A new theme which is being used for the trailer is the them for Gondor which is much more military and epic sounding than the theme of Rohan. For any Tolkien fan, or Peter Jackson fan, or just a lover of anything Lord of the Rings this is a much have. Some of the songs which make this album worth buying is Minas Tirith, The White Tree, The Steward if Gondro, Anduril, The Field of the Pelennor, The Black Gate Opens, The End of All Things, The Return of the King, and The Grey Havens. The music in each album have managed to surpass it predecessor. This is no exception. The series has been triumphant on all fronts and I enjoyed the book first and foremost over the movies. The movies have made a believer out of me and I am as passionate for this series as I am for life itself. It is pure genius and should be considered to be the greatest movies ever made as well for these soundtracks. The music is a movie unto itself. It is epic in every right and amazingly orchestrated. I can't wait for The Hobbit which is rumored for a 2006 release
B0000UMD00|1.0|I loved &quot;Mizzaunderstood&quot;.  Fantastic album.  This album is a terrible, shameful follow-up.  It is nothing more than a jamble of terrible song-writing and loud guitars.  No emotion.  The only decent song is &quot;Trouble&quot;.  Even that sounds terrible in comparison to Mizzaunderstod.  It's like she walked into the studio, said &quot;i don't give a ****, let's just record some *** so i can get out of here and get wasted.&quot;  I would have given the album no stars if that was an option.
B0000009SG|4.0|This is the beginning of the so called \\"New Era\\" for F. Zappa: such an accessible stuff, enriched with a lot of sexual references and bizarre features of \\"depravity\\" as well...otherwise it demonstrates also his ability in telling a story, by means of his particular music language!Moreover by regarding of his killer guitar solos and other stunning examples of some violin solos by Jean Luc Ponty, it isn't difficult to fall in love with this album. <BR>Recommended, also for his sociological tough satire!!
0385512104|5.0|Read the book cover to cover in one sitting.  Couldn't put it down!  Wonderful ending
B00007BH5C|5.0|Picking up where the Academy Award winning soundtrack for the Fellowship of the Ring ended; this soundtrack proves that it can be continue to have an epic sound and be original. The Fellowship has been broken apart as Sam and Frodo are now alone on their journey to Mordor. Merry and Pippin are held captive but manage to escape into the realm of Fangorn Forest. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas continue to pursue Merry and Pippin but instead ecounter an old friend returned from the great unknown: Gandalf the White who has departed from his old title of Gandalf the Grey. The soundtrack has some old themes from the first soundtrack such as a small portion of the Fellowship Hero theme. However, other themes are now presented in this album such as a much more evil and gut wrenching version of the theme of Isengard. A new theme is the one for the Rohan race which is has many hints of having an old english feel. The themes are darker and more mournful. The movie has many glaring moments of hope but is darker in context. This album continues the trend of being faithful to the movie. It is grander than the first album and doesn't hold back. It is an emotional masterpiece as the Journey in Middle Earth continues. Howard Shore and Co. are brilliant people to be able to make this type of music. Songs that are worth buying the album alone are The Foundation of Stone, The Riders of Rohan, The Uruk-Hai, King of the Golden Hall, Evenstar, The White Rider, Forth Eorlingas, and Samwise the Brave. The third album is expected to probably be the best of the three. Here is to The Return of the King
0553274503|4.0|I'm not a big fan of science fiction. Although this is classified as science fiction, it isn't the type of book that could easily fit into one specific genre. It raises philosophical questions about the nature of knowledge,genetic engineering, and the human spirit.<BR>The plot is fairly straightforward. Charlie is a mentally challenged man who works in a bakery and remembers little about his real family. He attends classes at a special education center for adults. Through this center he meets Professor Nemur and Dr. Strauss. They preform an operation that alters his cpacity to abosrb and understand information, giving him a &quot;super genius&quot; I.Q.<BR>The book is written from Charlie's perspective and follows his mental state from an eager, well-meaning, mentally challenged man, to a cynical, super-intelligent observer of human folly. The transformation in Charlie's emotinal state as well as his overall capacity to understand the world is what makes Flowers for Algernon so fascinating. I also found Charlie's recollections about his family very revealing. Through his memories, the reader is able to witness how a strugging family deals with having a mentally challenged child. His mother was an especially interesting character. I thought one of the best scenes in the book is when he goes back to confront her after &quot;becoming smart&quot;. I had one image in my mind of what his mother would be like, but then when he met her in person I was amazed at just how frail and utterly human she actually was. The role reversal between Charlie and his mother and sister after his transformation is astounding. The ending of the book brought me to tears. I was really moved by the author's ability to capture the  delicacy of the human mind as well as the stregnth of the spirit.
B0000009SY|4.0|Perhaps this is one of the most famous albums and of the best ones as well (perhaps the best one)...it's a sort of concept album telling the story of Joe and his role of &quot;Central Scrutinizer&quot;, as He's obliged to hold an unnatural behavior, within such role, till becoming an outlaw.The album begins with the accessible title track: Joe's Garage. After this easy intro, He becomes more and more ironical and quite bizarre too. <BR>Zappa doesn't perform a particular complex job with his guitar here,that is simply his typical rock and roll guitar solo, but his inspiration also in the lightest things is high as usual. Watermelon in Easter Hay demonstrates his skillful technique on guitar:his guitar playing inside is fantastic and as an incredible testament for his life, this song was played at his funeral...anybody, except on his Son Dweezil,won't play this &quot;cover song&quot; anymore!!At last all the songs for instance on Act I are a must-have,but this &quot;Watermelon in Easter Hay&quot; in particular is an unforgettable tribute,whenever it can be played by a capable and amazing guitarist too! <BR>So this testament is essential for every kind of personal &quot;discoteque&quot;
B00005JLT5|2.0|This film is competently made, even very involving in the beginning, but the disappearance of the Pianist's entire family so early on and endless shots of him staring out of various windows made me think there was a more interesting story going on elsewhere.<br />It would have had a much more profound effect if I'd never seen SCHINDLER'S LIST, Steven Spielberg's best &quot;adult&quot; masterpiece, but I kept comparing the atrocities of this film's color scenes of horror with Spielberg's black-and-white ones and had to go with SCHINDLER every time.<br />I've always loved what Polanski did with THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS, ROSEMARY'S BABY and especially CHINATOWN, but I've been scratching my head since then with efforts like FRANTIC, BITTER MOON and THE NINTH GATE.<br />THE PIANIST is one of his great films told at the pace of one of his bad films.<br />Sorry.
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King gives you three books for the price of one in this volume that combines literary memoir with an insightful guide to writing as well as an account of his brush with death.<br /><br />In the first section of the book, about a hundred pages, King describes his childhood and young married life in ways that explain those events' impact on his writing. There is a lot of affection for his mother and family, and this part is interesting primarily because King, as you would expect, weaves the story well and brings relevance to his anecdotes.<br /><br />The second section, about 150 pages, is composed of Toolbox and On Writing. These cover the very basics of writing (vocabulary, grammar and the overused adverb) and the craft of writing, respectively. On Writing is the section I enjoyed the most. Here, King gives practical advice on writing goals, the first vs. second draft, narration and description, dialogue, plot vs. story, theme, pacing, back story, symbolism and revision. He also discusses more esoteric points such as the redemptive power of writing. Using examples and naming authors, King imbues this portion with invaluable  instruction and recommendations.<br /><br />About 20 pages are devoted to the author's being hit by a van as he walked along a Maine country road, and this will be of interest to those who want to know more about this episode in King's life.  This incident and King's recuperation occurred while he was writing this book.<br /><br />The book concludes with a 5-page first draft of a story's opening scene followed by an edited version of the same passage, and a list of books King had read recently that he found exemplary in some regard. Both of these sections are useful for someone who is interested in writing or wants to pursue King's ideas further.<br /><br />I think this book was interesting, entertaining and instructive, and I would highly recommend it to aspiring authors (whether or not the horror genre is your cup of tea) or those who are interested in King the man. This is a great chance to get practical advice from a very successful author.ance to get practical advice from a very successful author.
B00005LC3Y|5.0|As a veteran of Marine Corps boot camp circa 1964, I can attest to the reality of the first half of this film. I literally had flash backs while watching. Whether one agrees with the methodology of the training or not, it was very real and in fact worked quite well. I would not trade the experience for anything. I don't think I'd like to do it again though... Once was enough.<BR>I believe the actors were well chosen for their roles and the movie is a winner and a part of my film library.<br />The Vietnam segment did leave a bit to be desired, but there was more reality to it than any other Viet Nam era movie that I have seen to date.<br />I recommend this film to anyone interested in finding out what Marine Corps boot camp was really like back in the &quot;Old Corps&quot;.
B000002H33|1.0|I hated this album so much. The only thing worse then new Metallica is Old Metallica. Someone told me to buy this album, so I did and it is the worst album in my collection. The SONGS NEVER END. If you want a good album Buy BLEACH by Nirvana... all you Metal heads will like the album...Bleach sounds nothing like Nevermind. <br /> P.S. did i mention that this is the worst album I have ever listened to. I am surprised that Metallica didnt fizzle out as fast as the spice girls.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|this is an instant classic!!!, a very emotional tribute to one of the greats...a must for all beatles fans..put a log on the fire, get cozy and get a box of tissues and enjoy this dvd..the song selections and the musicians who appear make this the best dvd ive seen!...thank you to all who helped put this together!!
B00005JKJA|1.0|Two words perfectly describe this movie:  SO WHAT!<br />David Lynch once again shows that he has the intellectual mind of a peanut.  <br />Hey, look at that weird old lady!  How about that Cowboy?  Lesbian love scenes?  We've got 'em!<br />Was it all a dream?  A slow, slow, slow moving dream?<br />Yawn.
B0000035E7|5.0|This CD is amazing... I bought it a wile back, listened to it and thought it was not nearly as good as Nevermind. I picked it up about a year later and listend to it again, and it dawned on me that this was a great album. It hardly sounds like anything else they released though. ( although none of their albums sound alike, (which is a good thing)). The Bass guitar on this album is excelent, and the guitar on the album is catchy. Buy this album, but dont be expecting a 'Teen Spirit'. Expect a deeper album that is driven by the AMAZING BASS.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|After waiting for this movie to come out on DVD, I was beyond impressed with the 2 disc offering.  Leone is a master of the art and I pick up more and more with each viewing!<br />The narration by film historians, directors, and members of the cast add so much to the film, so be sure to watch it once with the commentary turned on!!<br />Buy this video...you'll love it!!
B000089RVR|4.0|A beautifully written group of highly refined pop songs.  Lyrically excellent and an original sound.  The only thing comparable to Dido is possibly Seal, who is excellent in his own right.  This and her last album have a very British neo-pop sound that many Americans have problems digesting, but if you can appriciate high quality original pop, have a listen... you won't be dissapointed.
B000003TBP|5.0|Beck is a genius and this cd proves it. It haves everything : rock, hip hop, country, nice melodies...just EVERYTHING. Songs like Devil's haircutt, Minus and Jack-ass (with all the other songs on the album) will make you feel like you're tripping on acid on a magic carpet over heaven. It's one of my favorite cd's of all time(and its my favorite cd from BECK). If you are tired of the same old money loving music, and wanna hear something new, even if you are in the year 3010, this CD will satisfy your hunger for something NEW and FRESH.
0553213105|5.0|While I had many high expectations for this novel, they were all far exceeded when I actually picked up the book and read it -- and then could not put it down. Jane Austen's wit and charm constantly present throughout this story make it quite possible to laugh out loud. At a time when marriages were to go not beyond political correctness and money, Austen writes about the Bennett family, whose 5 daughters are all meant to find these advantageous lifestyles. While Mrs. Bennett is on a hurried and frantic quest to marry off each of her daughters, the two eldest, Elizabeth and Jane, are each on a journey of finding their true loves, whether they first realize that at meeting them or not. The plot line keeps entertainment and holds captive attention, and the twists and turns of this novel keep the reader coming back for more. It has my highest recommendation -- so go out and read it today!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Okay, so - chances are, if this is the first album of Rufus Wainwright's that you're buying and you come away not liking it?  Chances are good that you won't like the previous two.  People usually either love Rufus Wainwright's music or they hate it, either taking to it like a duck to water or dismissing it as self-indulgent, over-produced dreck.<br />I'm reminded of what Richard Gear's character said to Julia Roberts' character in Pretty Woman: &quot;If they love [opera], they always love it... but if they don't like it, then they spend the rest of their lives trying to appreciate it.&quot;  Rufus Wainwright's music, without a doubt, is definitely to be appreciated.  His melodies range from quiet and simple to strong and cacophonous.<br />The first two albums are a little easier on the ears, they don't place as many demands on your ears as Want One does.  Rufus Wainwright's music is very challenging to listen to - and I know that isn't often said about music - because the sheer number of instruments and sounds and harmonies featured in some of the tracks (especially on this album) is simply astounding.  His songwriting style also takes a while to get used to: he goes from pensive to quirky to poetic to wry, sometimes all in the same verse.  But his lyrics give you startling insight to his life and the lovely, everyday things he experiences... he's definitely a writer's songwriter, in that sense - all eyes and ears, observing and noting things down for future tracks.<br />If you're keen to listen to Rufus Wainwright's music, then I'd suggest the self-titled first album or Poses.  Me, I'm a little bit biased, I guess, as I love all three albums and await Want Two with bated breath...<br />If you love his work, you'll always love it - if you understand it, you always will.  If you don't love it or understand it, then you're missing out, big time.
B0000DD7LC|3.0|I've been a huge fan of Miss Keys since her first album dropped in 2001.  I was definitely looking forward to this one, after hearing her &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot; single in heavy rotation on the radios.. .but I have to say, this album was a bit of a disappointment.  Alicia's extremely talented and blessed with a powerful voice, but there were some awkward moments on this album.  She sings about her medulla oblongata being electrified, having cardiac arrest, and trying medication for her &quot;heartburn&quot; on &quot;Heartburn&quot; and &quot;Slow Down&quot; ..?!  And &quot;When You Really Love Someone&quot; sounds like another version of &quot;A Woman's Worth.&quot;  She seems to be artistically experimenting with several of her tracks and she's certainly shown passion and dedication to her work.  I just don't think this album matches her incredible talent and potential.  Still, some beautiful melodies on this record like &quot;If I Ain't Got You.&quot;  Good album, definitely not my favorite.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I think there is no sound more beautiful than Josh Groban singing in Italian.  &quot;Closer&quot; once again proves why.  &quot;Mi Mancharai,&quot; probably the song with the most classical influences, sends shivers down my spine.  Josh's phrasing in this song shows just how much he has grown musically.  The opener &quot;Oceano,&quot; a programmatic song reminiscent of a John Williams film score, finds Josh's voice undulating between major and minor with absolutely perfect pitch.  &quot;Closer&quot; reveals many songs that sound like they are from a grandiose film score.<br />Two of the English songs, &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot; and &quot;Broken Vow&quot; have a pop appeal and have great potential to become hits on Adult Contemporary radio.  These songs do not have the expansive sound as some of the others, but they embody a simpler, more intimate sound.<br />Perhaps Groban should have waited a few years to record &quot;Caruso,&quot; a tribute to the great tenor, and &quot;Hymne a l'amour,&quot; originally sung by the great Edith Piaf.  These songs call for more emotion than he is able to muster.<br />Overall, this CD is a huge leap for Groban.  The song choices are stronger and his voice sounds more mature.  In fact, Josh's compelling voice alone makes this CD well worth purchasing.
B000002AVF|5.0|Mariah was already huge by 1995, having sold millions and millions of records and achieved 8 #1's. She followed all her success in a big way with Daydream. With the amazing &quot;Fantasy&quot;, Mariah, became the first female artist to debut at number one with the album's first single, and then the album. &quot;Fantasy&quot; was an odd combination of lyric and sample that worked on every level.  The two subsequent singles &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, the record holder for #1, and &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot; (one of my favorite Mariah songs)were just as powerful. The R n'B feel carried over to tracks such as &quot;Long Ago&quot; and &quot;Underneath the Stars&quot;, but most tracks were similar to Mariah's previous AC ballads. This is hardly detrimental, as songs like &quot;Forever&quot; and &quot;Open Arms&quot;(remake) are simply beautiful. &quot;Looking In&quot; is deeply personal and a good way to end the album. Even though &quot;Melt Away&quot;, &quot;When I Saw You&quot;, and &quot;I Am Free&quot; may not appeal to everyone, any Mariah fan will appreciate the effort she put into this album. With 10 million copies sold, you more than likely have this. If not, it's time to travel back to 1995 and give this one another look.
1565117808|5.0|Amazing book. I hate it when people spoil books and movies for me so I won't say anything important. But I love the way Pi relates to religions, even conflicting religions of the world. I also enjoyed thoroughly the detail included while describing the mental and physical effort involved in survival. This fancifully woven plot is hard to set aside and is rewarding to the last word. I find that I still, 3 months after reading it, get flashes of emotions conveyed through its pages. I remember it fondly. I feel like a better person for reading it. Books don't often stick with me that way. The Life of Pi is highly recommended.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Miyazaki is a genius of animation: this is undeniable. Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro, Mononoke Hime, and Nausicaa are all masterworks of their various genres (anime is NOT a genre unto itself), or so I've been led to believe for Kiki's and Nausicaa. Spirited Away is another film in Miyazaki's spendidly grand tradition, mixing broad appeal in the design elements with Ghibli's always-beautiful animation style. I really can't gush about this movie enough, so I won't: just go see it. I don't care if you don't like anime, or if you've never watched it: everyone I've shown this film to has been stunned by its beauty and power.
B00003CXAW|5.0|I love both movies.  But I would not call Godzilla a superior film.  King Kong was animated utilizing stop-motion photography, a huge mechanical bust, a gigantic hand with finger joints, back screen projection and the optical printer.  The 18\\" high figures were extremely detailed in their joints and muscles so that animator Willis O'Brien could manipulate the movements to a high degree of accuracy.  These figures \\"the dinosaurs of Skull Island\\" not only jumped but also flew and, of course, no hint of wires could be seen.  Remember, there was no computer technology (the first electronic computers were developed in the 1940s)to perfectly smooth out the animation. The animation could not be checked til the film was developed and screened; not until then could it be corrected.  Of course this could get very expensive.  Godzilla used a man in a suit and a puppet for close-ups to great chilling effect and scale scenes of the monster combined with people were very realistic but the film looses credibility in its tonka toy like tanks and fire-engines. A wire is seen in a few scenes of Godzilla's tail but that doesn't bother been since it is so faint.  One point I have to address is the usage of that old hackneyed phrase, \\"The film's effects were great for its time,\\" which does such an injustice to both films!  Even recent films like 'The Hulk' with its innovative camera angles and great use of smooth computer animation could not keep its main character from looking cartoon-like and lacking a perfect 3 dimensional form.  But don't get me wrong I love The Hulk film.  I'm just making a few points to be fair and honest since the producers of all the films mentioned worked very hard to make a good product and should be treated fairly and reviewed in a tacful and mature manner.
0142004235|5.0|It's always difficult reading a book that has been praised to the skies without expecting too much, and that's why it usually fails to deliver. Those who read it after this book became an Oprah Book Club selection seem to have come to it with just such expectations.<br />Try, however, to always approach a book or movie, however much it has been praised, as any other. Simply pick it up and read it without any expectations. This is how I read it, and gosh, was I pleasantly surprised. <br />The characters are people I wish I could know personally--especially Samuel, I wished I could be one of his many children just to have him as a father; Lee, so taciturn yet wise and always there, such a comfort to have and know such a person; and Caleb, whom we tend to identify with in so many ways. <br />True, the story might have extremes, and be predictable if you were able to keep yourself so uninvolved in the story. Those who commented on the 'plot', perhaps such a book is not what you ought to read. Pick up a Grisham or some other fast-paced 'plotty' book. <br />East of Eden is for those who think, who care about who they are and who they want to be or ought to have been. People have talked of its being depressing. It's not. I hate depressing books myself. At least it's not a meaningless depression in which you can't identify with the story at all, but it simply sucks you down. This book made me cry at many points--from empathy or sympathy for the characters, from the beauty of the language, and from appreciating the wisdom in it. <br />I admire passages, descriptions, dialogues so much in this book that I re-read them, and re-read the entire novel already, and may do so again. I'm not the kind who likes to re-read books either. There's simply so much wisdom and simplicity and reassurance in here that it's a treasure--for me, at least. I think I'm lucky to have a book that means so much to me.
B000006U44|4.0|Very surprised no one has yet mentioned the fact that 'saxophone song' and 'the man with the child in his eyes' were recorded(at least the vocals were) a couple of years before the other tracks. The differences in Kate's vocals are stark, I love it when she sings in her 'pure' style like these two tracks. I'm not so keen on the strange vocal style she must have developed in the intervening period, just listen to 'feel it' and compare the vocals with 'the man with the child in his eyes'. <BR>My other two favourite Kate Bush tracks are also sung in her 'pure' voice - 'This Woman's Work' and 'Moments Of Pleasure'. I just wish she had stuck with this style throughout her career.
B00005JLKB|5.0|&quot;Metemorphis&quot; the second episode in the series is the absolute best episode in &quot;Smallville.&quot;  It features my favorite villian Greg Arkin (aka the bug boy) in a excellent &quot;Smallville&quot; episode with an &quot;X-Files&quot; touch.
B00000263T|4.0|This is without doubt one of Accept's finer albums. The title track, \\"Metal heart\\" (with its \\"Fur Elise solo\\") as well as the closing \\"Bound to fail\\"  are hard and groovy numbers with quite a lot of melody. \\"Wrong is right\\" is fast and attractive track, rather similar to \\"Fight it back\\" from the \\"Balls to the wall\\" album, while songs like \\"Midnight mover\\" and \\"Screaming for a love bite\\" has a lighter touch. The over all impression is that Accept's \\"Metal heart\\" is a solid effort, and it reminds of a time when we all knew what heavy metal stood for.
B00001QEE9|5.0|I am 70 yrs. old, and saw all of the great Disney movies on their original release as a child. Lest my qualifications are questioned, I have TWO PhD's, and am a retired professor who at the moment am building computers and reading at least 2 books a week. I've travelled all of the &quot;lower&quot; 48, and visited over 20 (again) in the last 3 years. <BR>We have become a nation so frightened and split into groups that teach children fear and hatred. I'm afraid of what the children will become. I have a dozen grand children (at the moment) and have bought them all copies of the my fovorite Disney movies, with Snow White, Pinnocchio and (original) Fantasia at the top. Neither I, nor any of my friends my age, thought of those early movies as anything but what they were--wonderful stories. An example of the worst of our society is Eisner--a monster who takes movies off the market for years, and has stated he won't release the great folk tale &quot;The Song of the South&quot; because it MIGHT be &quot;politically incorrect,&quot; an ugly concept that divides our country into &quot;clans&quot; walking on eggs in fear of &quot;offending&quot; some other group. I have watched most of the movies with each of my grand children, and SURPRISE, they loved them and are growing up to be intellegent and open minded, without fear or hate or whining. They learn their values from parents,grand parents and friends, not from movies and not from the twisted ideas of people they are pushed to associate with.
B00005YRLG|3.0|When Accept released \\"Restless and wild\\" back in 1982, heavy metal was a very dominant musical genre. \\"New\\" bands popped up everywhere and some were better than others. Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Motorhead, Saxon, Scorpions and of course Accept were proudly exposed in the form of patches on the long haired fans' jeans jackets. <br />This efforts starts with the furious \\"Fast as a shark\\" which has become more or less Accept's trade mark, and closes with a slower fan favourite by the name of \\"Princess of the dawn\\". In between there's plenty of heavy metal in the style of New Wave Of British Heavy Metal. Singer (some might object to call Udo Dirkschneider that) has a growling and rough voice with more in common with Brian Johnson (AC/DC) and Lemmy (Motorhead) than the likes of David Coverdale (ex Deep Purple, Whitesnake) or Ronnie James Dio (ex Rainbow, Dio). But Dirkschneider works just fine in Accept, and the rest of the band (especially guitar player Wolf Hoffman) can surely play. With songs like \\"Restless and wild\\", \\"Shake your head\\" and \\"Ahead of the pack\\", this is a fine example of traditional heavy metal. This effort might not be Accept's best work as some people claim but it would certainly be treat to anyone who's into this kind of metal. It's raw and it's unpolished and it will most certainly upset your neighbours as long they're not real metalheads.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is sooooo much bettter than her first.  The lyrics and music are excellent.  The songs all have a different feel.  Definitly recommended!
B000002672|3.0|\\"Russian roulette\\" shows Accept in fine form and it's not at all a pop album or a sell out. I can't see how some people think that Accept turned commercial with this one. With tracks like \\"TV war\\", \\"Aiming high\\", \\"Another second to be\\" and \\"Man enough to cry\\" it would be obvious that Dirschneider and his gang stay faithful to their former approach. And guitarist Wolf Hoffman is just as great as ever with his own style. To me, Hoffman is one of the most under rated guitar players in the whole genre. This album might not be in the same class as \\"Balls to the wall\\" and \\"Metal heart\\" but it is without doubt worth having if you're into traditional heavy metal.

0375703764|4.0|If you like the movies Fight Club or Mullholland Drive, you'd probably get a kick out of this novel.  Following the multi-layered plot of House of Leaves is sometimes difficult, but if you piece together the multiple plot lines of the entire novel, the overlapping thematic strands are quite interesting, and pretty obvious.  It's not your average Harry Potter read (no offense intended to fans); there's quite some depth to the book, and in looking into a general overview of the author's life at the time he wrote it, one understands that the book speaks of the figurative inner labryinths of our minds and consciousness through the literal descriptions of the maze of the house.  It's a unique and experimental novel, and plays with your head (in a good way).  The narrator and the book he's talking about are represented simultaneously in the text, so I recommend reading a few pages of Johnny's story, a few of Zampano's, and go back and forth as such (don't read all of one story and then all of the other - it won't make any sense that way).  The parallels between the two stories are intriguing, and in the end you'll understand what's up with Johnny.  The format of the book alone is art; very original, very postmodern.  If you're into different areas of art weaving together, I suggest listening to his sister Poe's cd Haunted before reading the book (to better understand the psychological basis for the novel).  Reading the poetry in the back of the book also clarifies the theme and plot a bit more.  I suggest not reading about the house as a literal object, but as a symbol for the inner workings of the mind - it will make more sense that way.  Scary, provoking, and wickedly original, House of Leaves will weave in and out of your consciousness for months after reading.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|To help celebrate the big-screen re-release of Alien (a special director's cut), Fox home video has unleashed an unprecedented \\"Quadrilogy\\" set of all four Alien films, spanning the years 1979 - 1997). Just in time for the Holidays, too.<br /><br />If you are from another planet and haven't seen Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) yet, here's the gist: the Nostromo crew lands on a far-flung planet in deep space to investigate a mysterious transmission emanating from its bowels. While on the alien planet, one of the crewmembers is attacked by a spider-like creature that adheres itself to his face. He is taken back to the Nostromo, where it is learned -- too late -- that the creepy critter has laid an egg into his body. Like all incubating eggs, it waits only to hatch... and it turns out to be anything but over-easy as it stalks the crew, picked them off one-by-one in the hollow, dark, shadowy and cyberpunky floating vacuum of the Nostromo. Where no one's screams are heard. That is, until the sequels were made.<br /><br />Staci Layne Wilson
B00005JMFR|4.0|I will not waste your time on descriptions of story and explainations of how I understood each theme is represented. This, like the first movie, is up to you, the individual viewer. I will say that if you have fallen into the trap of thinking these movies are anything more than above average intellect popcorn movies, you will surely be disappointed, thus should just wait for the DVD release. There is no higher purpose here, except what YOU personally take from these movies.<br />I thourghly enjoyed this movie. Where the second chapter suffered from a bloated \\"wow\\" factor, Revolutions is a stripped down, to the basic core, fight for survival. Gone is the overabundance of pointless kungfu and \\"watch us top that\\" action. In its place is the simple fight to keep a race of people alive.<br />I have issue with the choice of lead character that is killed off just because it renders certain events of Reloaded pointless. Other than that, the ending was handled the only way it could be. If you are one that expects neatly tied up endings with everything spelled out for you, you will be disappointed.

0385504209|4.0|The Da Vinci Code, at the moment, seems to be the book du jour.  Everyone's talking about it - and for good reason.  In what is rare in modern fiction, it combines the rare duality of highly suspenseful entertainment along with provocative historical insight.  The intriguing settings of Paris and London make for an ideal backdrop for this well-crafted tale(it is fiction people) that you can't put down.  This is one of those rare books that will keep you up at night reading - as opposed to serving as a cure for insomnia.<br />Si vous pouvez parler francais, c'est tres utile pour ce livre.  If you can't(speak French, that is), then a French-English dictionary would be of use when reading The Da Vinci Code, which, at times, uses French without translation.  The characters are well designed, yet mysterious - which lends itself to the making of a great mystery.  Not only are you trying to figure out the identity of the murderer(it happens on page 1 so I'm not giving anything away here), you also find yourself deeply ensconced in the quest for the historical truth of, among other things, Mary Magdalene, Jesus, Da Vinci, The Holy Grail, Opus Dei, The Vatican, and most inscrutably, The Priory of Sion.  While this is fiction, it will invariably raise some eyebrows in any circle.  Read it yourself and be your own judge.

0790730960|5.0|Yeah, the first Tim Burton Batman movie was really good(would have been better if they didn't have annoying Kim Basinger!), but this movie is just AWESOME! Why? Because CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN are just awesome in this all over! I saw this when it first came out to video and I had never been into comics nor did I have a favorite female comic character(like most girls do). Well after seeing Michelle Pfeiffer practically steal the whole movie as Catwoman, Catwoman became my fav comic character and still is! Michelle is just AWESOME!!! I wanted to be her so badly as Catwoman! I became practically obsessed with Catwoman and I would watch this movie obsessively! And Danny DeVito is just perfect as the Penguin! He is just awesome as well! I just love this movie, and it's definitly my FAV Super Hero movie ever! I wish Michelle had done a spin-off as Catwoman! That would have been a dream come true!!!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|The first time I listened to this album, the only songs that caught my attention right away were Fallen and Dirty Little Secret. You really have to listen to the other songs more than once. World on Fire, Answer, and Stupid sound really good if you pay attention to the instrumentals and lyrics. The remaining five songs are alright but were not great.  Parts of the songs sound really good, like the refrain in Push and the instrumentals in Train Wreck. Since there were only ten songs on the album, I would have preferred it if Sarah had released a two disc greatest hits album.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is an awesome book. When I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Orson Scott Card just drew me in. I was amazed how the kids are so intelligent. In the book, Peter, Ender's brother, has a major influence over world events when he is fourteen. It has all the essential parts of a great novel. Ender's Game has an amazing plot, and is very interesting. Card is very detailed about everything. I liked how he put so much detail in Ender's virtual game. Card explained it like if you were playing it. I started the book, and was required to read it in a couple weeks, and ended up reading it in three days. It is a very detailed science fiction book. The stuff in this book was science fiction, so it probably wouldn't happen now. But it could in the future. I think that in the future we could go live on a different planet like Ender does. I haven't read the other books in the series, but I hope that they are all as good as or better than this one.

B00003CXAA|4.0|The Godfather I and II are two of my favorite movies. Everything about them is impeccable. Wonderful acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography, and a great score to boot. Unfortunately, the lackluster Godfather III is also included in this DVD set. Although not a horrible movie when compared to most of the dreck which comes out of Hollywood, Godfather III still fails on several levels and is certainly one of the grossest miscalculations in movie history. Were it not for the flawed 3rd installment, this package would get 5 stars.

0316666343|4.0|My mom and I read a book recently, called The Lovely Bones, by Alice Seabold. It is written in the form of a fiction novel, and would be considered to have a genre of horror, suspense and tragedy, since the book is just one big tragedy after another. The book's copyright date is 2002, which would make it relatively new, yet the book is set in 1973, in a small town in the United States in which a girl is murdered. In this essay, I will explain the main character of the book, give a short summary about it and identify and explain the theme, as well as give my own opinion about the book.<br />The main character in the book is Susie Salmon, who is a 14 year old girl living in 1974. She is skinny, with long blonde hair, and blue eyes, and could be described as pretty. She has good grades in school and over analyses every situation, which can sometimes get to be annoying, since the book is written in first person, and she is narrating it. She has a very friendly behaviour, and she is pretty confident about everything. Also, she is a too outgoing, which is what led her to be raped. In my opinion, she lacked decision-making skills and self-awareness, but because of this, her character is very interesting.<br />The book is written in the first person with Susie Salmon narrating it. It all begins with her going with a complete stranger to his special place, where he rapes and killer's her. After that, Susie goes to heaven and describes how everything works in heaven, which in my opinion reflected what the author thought of heaven. That allowed me to get to know a little about the author, and what feelings she tries to transmit as she writes. During the whole book, Susie describes what she sees as she looks over her family, and describes how they get over her death, and how each member of the family carries on with their lives. The book's main conflict is that no one knows, or even suspects who the killer is; No one, that is except the father, Jack. This makes everyone in theneighbourhood think he is mad, and makes his wife cheat on him with the detective, Mr. Fennerman. The climax of the book is definitely when the mother, who ran away from home and abandoned her two other children, returns, because from then on, everybody's problems start resolving themselves.<br />The main theme of the book, however, is the girls death, and all of the problems created by her death, especially within her family. As she watches on heaven, her family begins to break apart. Her sister completely loses contact with her parents, even though they are still living together. The mother abandons her old life and her children and runs off with some man to California. The father, who is the only one trying to solve the mystery of her daughters murder, is caught between insanity and loneliness, as no one helps him catch the murderer. All of these problems start creating more problems themselves, making the girl's death, along with all of these initial problems, the main theme of the book.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to others, because even though the content is depressing, and the interpretation of heaven is farfetched, it is the insanity and sadness of the book which makes it so enjoyable to read. I consider the main idea of the book important and worth studying, because rape and murder is something that does happen in the real world, and we must find ways to prevent them. It is also a great book to help you see that not all families are perfect, yet anyone can find a way to happiness. The main idea of the book, is however, not convincingly explained, since the main character lacked self-awareness, and accompanied a perfect stranger to the middle of a cornfield. I do not believe that any 14 year old girl would be so stupid, as to go with a stranger to an isolated area. <br />In this essay, I have explained the main character of the book, gave a short summary about it, identified and explained the theme of the book, and gave my own opinion about it. The book itself included many morals, which can be very useful in real life, such as never fully trusting strangers, and that anyone can find happiness somehow. Some aspects of the book were idiotic and unrealistic, but it is those frustrating moments, mixed with a great feeling of depression, which made this such a great book. <br />My mother's opinion on the book:<BR> I find that there are several topics that are very difficult for parents to deal with, and one of them is definitely the death of a child. This feeling is intensified if the subject we are dealing with involves rape and violent murder.  So I find that reading a novel that deals with these subjects can be a chilling experience.<br />I found The Lovely Bones to be a book that was hard to read, not only because of the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraph, but I didn't agree with Alice Seabold's interpretation of Heaven. I found it to be more a wishful appreciation of what Heaven can be like than the creation of a Fantasy. <BR>Death is definitely a complicated subject to deal with, and the family complications that arose from the murder of the main character were perhaps one of the issues that I found interesting. On the other hand, I enjoyed the nostalgic scenes that were set in the 70's. Particularly, the smoking area at school, which demonstrates that smoking was widely accepted, and the naivety of teenagers during that time period.
B00008LDPU|4.0|For those who enjoyed the Matrix trilogy and want still more, you are in luck.  The Animatrix is a series of animated short films that all take place in the Matrix universe and are reasonably faithful to the movies.  In total, there are nine films by eight different animators (one does a two-part story); each one is done in an anime style, so this is not your standard Disney stuff.<br />As this is a mixed bag of animators, there is a mixed quality to the stories, although they are overall pretty good.  Probably the shiniest gem in the whole bunch is the two-part story (The Second Renaissance) that gives a history of the man-machine confict and shows that fault can be definitely attributed to both sides.  Unlike the Terminator films, which depict the computers as completely evil, the ones portrayed here are not nearly as malevolent.  <br />The other stories are pretty intriguing too for the most part.  Some just look pretty without really being decent tales.  Some of the more interesting include a tale involving a group of people trying to reform the machines and the off-beat way their plan backfires (Matriculated), a film noir detective story (Detective Story) and a look at a building where \\"errors\\" are occurring, and the strange physics that people encounter there (Beyond).  Less satisfying are a couple stories about a teenager and an athlete (Kid's Story and World Record, respectively) who start noticing the line between Matrix and reality; these fit into the look-pretty-but-little-else category.<br />If you are not a fan of the Matrix or are unfamiliar with the movies, this would not be a good viewing choice; there is an assumption that the viewer is knowledgeable of the films.  If you are a Matrix fan, this is a nice supplemental feature that shouldn't disappoint.
1593080204|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an account of society in the early nineteenth century.  Austen primarily focuses on the ridiculous pressure to marry.  She does an exquisite job satirizing or \\"poking fun\\" at the extreme views of those who lived during that time.  She gives the reader a good look at how truly important first impressions are and how love can conquer all.  Austen develops her main characters Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, with very conflicting character traits.  These conflicting traits allow the build up of tension between these two characters.  This gives the novel a pleasant amount of intensity that leads to an ousting ending.  Austen sucks you into a thoroughly enchanting world, making the novel impossible to put down.  I recommend this novel to those who enjoy intellectual wit and have a soft heart for romance.  Pride and Prejudice is a wonderfully endearing novel that is bound to touch women of every age.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Jeepers Creepers is one of those disposable monster movies that is reasonably entertaining while not offering anything particularly new.  While it's not a waste of time, if you missed it, your life would be none the poorer for it.  Executed with slightly more intelligence than usual, Jeepers Creepers does offer some fun.<br />A brother and sister are traveling along a near-deserted highway when they are nearly run off the road by an old truck.  Later they see the truck near an abandoned church and see its owner dumping what appear to be bodies down a pipe.  The sister is smart enough to want to get away as far as possible (and notify the police in the process), but the brother wants to investigate, motivated by curiosity and a desire to save anyone who might still be alive.  What they find is far worse than they imagine.<br />However, in an inversion of most of these horror films, the characters are actually at their greatest peril not when they stupidly head towards danger but rather when they intelligently go to safety.  Therefore, the more the brother and sister do what the viewer thinks is the right thing, the worse things actually get.<br />This is pure monster movie.  There is little in the way of plot twists or deep characterization and no romance to speak of; on the other hand, there is a little bit of humor and some okay effects.  Overall, this is slightly above average, a weak four stars, and a pleasant diversion even if it is not anything overly special.
0064407667|5.0|This book is a must read! The book is sad, funny, witty, sarcastic, and interesting. I highly enjoyed the sarcasm, the depiction of adults in society, the incredibly intelligent Baudleiers, and the horrid Count Olaf. The book is descriptive so you imagine the story as you read and wish the the best for the Baudeliers even though Lemony keeps telling you that there is no happy ending. One of my favorite parts in the book is when Snicket talks about lawyers as being necessary because no one in their right mind would want to read law books. I really enjoyed this book and  even though I do not fit the age category for this book, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to have as Snicket would say \\"a miserable time reading a depressing book, when you could be outside playing in the snow\\".

I don't think there will be another story told as wonderful as this one.

Greed and Forgiveness are two important ones that we all could learn from.
B0000E1ALR|3.0|This is great music by a great artist. However, &quot;The Essential&quot; could have been so much better!<br />The sequencing is strictly chronological, while the selections lack too many songs to make this a chronology. Instead of the third bonus disc, &quot;The Essential&quot; itself should have been stretched onto three discs (i.e. like Dylan's &quot;Biograph&quot;) - with more songs and a different sequencing. <br />This is what it should have been:<br />DISC 1: <br />1. Blinded By The Light <BR>2. It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City <BR>3. 4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)<BR>4. Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)<BR>5. Spirits In The Night <BR>6. Lost In The Flood <BR>7.

Light Of Day [Live]<BR>8. Secret Garden  <BR>9. Streets Of Philadelphia <BR>10. The Ghost Of Tom Joad<BR>11. Youngstown<BR>12. Dry Lightning<BR>13. Brothers Under The Bridge <BR>14. Blood Brothers <br />15. This Hard Land  <br />Due to its background, material from &quot;The Rising&quot; should be excluded from a collection like this. It is an important and a much appreciated album on its own, but it's neither essential, nor does it belong here to the prior body of work, that for its better parts has written rock music history.<br />Also, if there had to be live-performances, why choose two songs that fans would much rather hear in STUDIO versions? Why choose them over more representive live gems such as &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze Out&quot; or &quot;Light Of Day&quot;? Also, there is already &quot;Live 1975-1985&quot; to do Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E-Street Band as one of the greatest live acts of the 20th century justice.<br />As for the rare material of the bonus CD - it should not have been included here, but much rather on &quot;Tracks&quot;. No matter how great the material is, the way it's issued here is a slap in the face of every hardcore fan who bought the expensive &quot;Tracks&quot; box set.<br />The music on &quot;The Essential&quot; is worth every single penny. But unfortunately, &quot;The Essential&quot; as a release isn't. What I'm saying is that the music should be presented (and consumed) in a much better context than this. So I'll give 5 stars for Bruce Springsteen and his music, minus 2 stars for a release like this. <br />Beginners should much rather start with &quot;Live 1975-1985&quot; or the classic albums instead. On &quot;The Essential&quot; you get lot of great music, but a bit too few Bruce Springsteen for your money.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|At what point in its history did rock and roll become an art form?  One could very well argue that the genesis may be Bob Dylan's &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;.  On &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; Dylan puts aside his acoustic guitar and plugs in to fuse electric blues with poetic lyricism.  This combination would provide the palette for many rock and roll acts to branch out and write songs about topics other than fast cars and girls.<BR>  In songs like &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot;, &quot;From a Buick 6&quot;, and &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; Dylan and his band rip through the songs with a jangling blues sound that is matched with rapid fire stream of conscious lyrics that will keep your mind occupied for days.  <BR> Dylan and his band are also able to slow the tempo down enough to play some of Dylan's hidden gems &quot;It Takes A Lot to Laugh, It Takes A Train to Cry&quot; and &quot;Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues&quot;.  <BR> Ironically, one of the best songs and probably most interesting in terms of lyrics on the album is the epic &quot;Desolation Row&quot; in which Dylan straps on the acoustic guitar and shows his critics that he has not forgotten his roots.  In &quot; Desolation Row&quot;, Dylan brings to life an apocalyptic tale that is so descriptive that it mesmerizes the listener.  No other song of this length has held my attention for its duration as &quot;Desolation Row&quot;.  The lyrics alone will occupy your mind for as long as you are alive.  <BR>  Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy now.  The SACD is well worth the purchase as the remastered version really does an excellent job of separating the various instruments and sounds as fresh as if it were produced this year.
078322804X|5.0|This is my favorite movie; no matter how many times I see it, I feel great after watching it.  The story is almost there (but somehow, it all works, on a very &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; level) but the exuberance and THE SOUNDTRACK is without equal. Period.
068485743X|3.0|The premise of this book is dark: Most writers, and especially beginning writers, have little chance of getting published or even catching the interest of a literary agent.  You'll probably get rejected before agents reach page six.  You can improve your chances a bit (or get rejected with dignity) by making some adjustments in your presentation and writing.  Along the way you might sanitize your art to the point all signs of life are gone, but better that you get agents what they're looking for.  <br />Lukeman acknowledges the contradiction, and he's not responsible for the facts of publishing life.  As many rejectees have figured out, the capitalist writing market is cruel and unfair.  Take this book for example -- although its subject is writing and it weighs in at fewer than 200 pages, it contains numerous writing and editing gaffes, including a several in its first five pages.  Lukeman is an agent, so presumably he had no trouble despite violating his own standards.  <br />To be fair, this is a straightforward and practical book.  My writing improved as a result of reading it, and I thank him for sharing his insights.  In the end, however, Lukeman's most dramatic point may be one he made inadvertantly.
B00005JMFI|5.0|A delightful holiday movie for the whole family.  The story line was great and followed through the entire movie. Lots and lots of laughs in this movie.  It points out some of the things we take for granted, including Christmas Spirit.
B00005JKN9|2.0|I've seen most of Scorsese's films. But I've seen none of his as dissapointing as this one is. On a film that should have been a perfect vehicle for Scorsece to shine yet again he fails in dramatic and pompous fashion.<br />  Rewind about 200 years back. New York is basically a battleground for gangs of different ethnicities, as everyone struggles for turf, survival, and the avoidance of a future in a casket. We are introduced into the rivalry of two such gangs, the Natives headed by the knife-happy Butcher and the Dead rabbits headed by the Priest. The Butcher slaughters the Priest in a daylight brutal battle as his gang comes out on top leaving tens of chopped up corpses on the fresh snow. &quot;So far so good&quot; but we're only 10 minutes into the film and it only goes downhill from there on.<br />  How so? Because from that point on the film traps itself into the following ill-advised choices:<br />-it focuses on the rivalry between the Butcher and the son of the dead Priest, Vallon or &quot;Amsterdam&quot; (played flatly by Di Caprio).It becomes impossible to identify with either of these characters, indeed as the film drags painfully on (close to 3 hours) you dont care who slaughters whom. You just want this film to end.<br />--It introduces us into a Titanic-like love affair between Di Caprio and C.Diaz which has nothing to do with anything as far as the plot of the film is concerned and further ties up the pace and development of the plot.<br />---Because the film tends to focus mostly on two people it has little time (and means) to actually get busy with what it's supposedly about: the history of the gangs of 18th century New York.<br />  It's really hard to understand Scorcese's choices on this one. To begin with, the cast. Di Caprio, predictably, is totally out of his league here. He looks in place acting out the sorry and insignificant love affair that kills the middle part of the film but is basically unconvincing for the remainder. Furthermore he's drowned by D.D Lewis who is the only character with any depth and the only played with any inspiration  Cameron Diaz? Her part in the story looks like it was rammed in from another film. Titanic meets the Gangs is really not a good idea at all. But they are similar in a weird way: they both sink with few survivors.<br />  As if this was all not bad enough the script is a majorly poor job. Whereas Scorsece's films are usually noted for strong scripts this one isn't. Quite the opposite. While the script loses itself into the pointlessness of Vallon's love affair and the micropolitics of his plan for revenge against the Butcher it has no time and no space to narrate the story most of the audience will be looking for: the story of the gangs of New York that is. There are scattered references here and there, the draft riots, the corrupt politicians, the horrifying living conditions of the city inhabitants, but they are few and far in between.<br />  For anyone who doesn't have a knowledge of New York history before watching this doomed epic chances are small he'll emerge with more historical knowledge than before he saw it. It's hard to put together the pieces , it's even harder to extract any explanations, any historical explanations, as to why this is all happening.<br />  All in all, Scorcese fans will probably be alienated with this. This is not what this director has accustomed us to.<br />  Two stars are well in place because:<br />-of D.D.Lewis's performance which is the only one that stands out in this tragic affair of poor performances. Sadly he's the only pole of attention here. He basically goes it alone.<br />-of the stunning visuals, particularly the incredible reproduction of 18th century New York which is truly breath-taking. But even that isn't enough to salvage the &quot;gangs&quot;.<br />  One of the rare occasions where Scorcese misses.

B000089RVX|5.0|This album is absolutely well done allthe way through. The styles--rapping and singing---are well put together. Amy Lee sounds like a goddess
B00005NG9Z|1.0|I have a large collection of music DVDs and laserdics, so I have a pretty good spread of quality in terms of video and audio quality.  First of all, you can't beat the bang for the buck on this one.  Pricing aside, I really liked the way they inserted some documentary footage, especially from the band's earlier days to show some personality.  The videos look clean (even on a large HD projection screen) with good color as well.  I was very pleased with the 5.1 surround mix on my system, which is where many of these DVDs fail.  I recommend this highly if you want both a greatest hits collection with some well produced videos.
B0000636UN|5.0|This album has received mixed reactions from fans. It was her first album in 3 and a half years, and the thing is you either love it or you hate it. I'll go with the former. C'MON C'MON is a good set of songs, great soundtrack to the summer. Opening with the uptempo &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, the album plays like a tribute to 70's rock. &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; was the big single from the album, with its instantly catchy and accessible chorus. The album has some amazing songs, like the closing &quot;Weather Channel&quot; which fans will like if they enjoyed her previous forays into the darker side of life, the more depressing side. The title track is a nice piece of rock, with a great chorus. The duet with Don Henley, &quot;It's So Easy&quot;, is a great emotional ballad about not being able to let go of someone you are having an affair with. &quot;Diamond Road&quot; has some really nice lyrics that are reflective and positive. &quot;Safe And Sound&quot; is absolutely brilliant, a great song. &quot;Over You&quot; and &quot;Lucky Kid&quot; serve as nice rockers. The songwriting is good on this album. Sheryl has a good grasp of rock and roll, what works and what doesn't. Other highlights include &quot;You're An Original&quot;, &quot;Abilene&quot; and &quot;It's Only Love&quot;. Overall, give it a shot, like I said if you are a fan of Sheryl's you will either love this album or you won't like it.
0684800713|5.0|A book about people partying and living life. It is about taking a glimpse into the lifestyle of the wild characters. It is fun and would say it is a must read once.<br />Cohn the Jew Boxer, Brett the lady, Montaya the hotel owner, the bloody bull fights,the flirty evenings in Paris, Romero the bullfighter, careless fishing, those drinking days..........its all in here....Hemingway's style makes this book very colourful and you will feel like having an escapade of your own. So grab a copy and then go plan your escapade
B0000BWVCJ|5.0|Xmen 2 is better than the first one. There is more action, more special effects, more mutants, and more of everything compared to the first one. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies based on comic books or even the average movie audience.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm not Lewis Tatem, I'm his 14 year old daughter. I just bought this album yesterday. I was supposed to save it for a christmas party. I couldn't wait. This, so far, is Britney's best album so far, probably because of the collaberations and the fact that only two of the songs are weak ballads (like the album Baby one more time was all weak). Also, her music finaly matches her image, which is great. This album is worth buying, I also reccomend Dangerously in love by Beyonce.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Despite your particular musical tastes, Radiohead's influence on alternative rock is difficult to ignore.  Love them or hate them, they're a seminal band who have covered a lot of ground.  And whenever the band is mentioned, the first album to come up is almost always &quot;Ok Computer&quot;.  Many fans were alienated by Radiohead's departure from the true rock sound of &quot;The Bends&quot;, but seemingly more were turned on to the sound of something new, an idea which the Fab Five are pursuing to this day.  Look on any list of best albums of the 90's (often of all time), and you'll always find &quot;Ok Computer&quot;.<br />Radiohead is best reviewed by their musical sound, as frankly, its hard to understand what Thom is saying some times.  The cd starts off well with &quot;Airbag&quot;, not the greatest song on the cd, but with a beautiful refrain meeting the listener at the end of each verse.  Next is the first single from the cd, &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, a track which, while overrated, is still extremely solid, despite having a completely random structure that doubtlessly confounded listeners at first hearing.  Radiohead's weird prefascination with aliens comes through on this cd, with this track and &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;, a description of the people of Earth for an alien from outer space.<br />&quot;Exit Music (For A Film)&quot; is best recognized as the exit music for the 1996 &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;, and no music could be more appropriate.  It's a total departure from the rest of the album, though the subject material is the same.  The entire album reminds us of how inane and trivial people are, but Track 4 is the first track to truly mourn it, and place a curse on our houses.  &quot;Let Down&quot; is oddly enough, a pick up, with some of the most beautifully depressing lyrics written.<br />However, the high point of the album for me are the next few tracks.  &quot;Karma Police&quot; takes a ridiculous concept and turns it into gold.  &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; is far more complex than its simple composition merits, and has the best commentary on the album.  And &quot;Electioneering&quot; is potentially the most solid track on the entire album, with an anti-establishment poke in the ribs and a killer guitar hook.<br />With the exception of &quot;No Surprises&quot; (a beautiful song, that sounds almost childish in composition), the next few tracks aren't particularly exceptional, but &quot;The Tourist&quot; does its job (with the repeated &quot;slow down&quot;) in bringing the album to a close.  Thom Yorke spends the entire 53+ minutes crying for the world that we live in, and what its become.  In the last five minutes, his voice is not only beautiful, but for the first time in the course of the cd, it sounds like there may be, potentially...some glimmer of hope?old.  &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; is far more complex than its simple composition merits, and has the best commentary on the album.

B00009RDG9|3.0|\\"The Hunted\\" is a nice action film that follows in the footsteps of \\"First Blood.\\"  It was filmed right here in Portland, Oregon, so Oregonians will get a kick out of seeing Portland become the battlefield for several chase scenes.  The script of this film is quite bad.  While I like Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro, their lines seem to be quite awkwardly delivered.  I'm not quite sure about the reason for this.  Jones seems to be playing a character he has played before and rushes his lines without giving us any sense of why he is doing so.  Despite this setback, the film does achieve much in the action sequences and does a pretty good job when no one is speaking.  Furthermore, I enjoyed the fact that I had a hard time taking sides in this film.  It is unclear who the \\"bad guy\\" is, and the only real candidate for the slot is the government.<br />I really enjoyed the knife fighting sequences in this film.  They look exceptionally realistic and more down-to-earth than many other knife fighting scenes I have viewed over the years (think Segal).  The survival and tracking aspects of this film will awaken any outdoor enthusiast and make him or her want to head out for the wild.  I enjoyed all of these sequences and even wanted more of them.  All in all, while I was entertained by this film, it drags in many sections and I would have liked to see the characters develop themselves more.  As far as the special features are concerned, the documentaries are quite interesting-particularly the one on Tom Brown, the tracking and survival expert used to give the film a realistic feel.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta - De Loused In The Comatorium is one of my two choice for album of the year (the other being the incredible 'Avalanche' by Matthew Good). After the demise Of At The Drive In and the passing of the ashes, Mars Volta proves they have gotten the better half of the remains, as opposed to Sparta. From the moment you put the cd into your player to the end of the last song, you will be impressed. This band has taught me that 'love at first listen' songs can stay excellent instead of fading away and becoming repetitive. I'd rather not describe every track to you and ruin the ride, however I will tell you my personal favorites off of the cd. The epic masterpiece of 'Cicatriz ESP' opens with the backround music of 'Inertiatic ESP' but soon proves to be a much stronger song. It may seem long to some, yet the long break in the song is almost necessary to bring back the brilliant chorus. My other favorite song happens to be 'Eriatarka.' A very catchy chorus and intelligent lyrics makes this song something special. Especially adding in the jaw-dropping guitar work.<br />All in all I am proud to own this cd. I can listen to it over and over without it losing it's perfection. De Loused In The Comatorium should be at the top of any music fan who enjoys intelligent, yet catchy songs.
B0000640S2|2.0|Now...I like action just as much as any guy.  I grew up watching these films with my father, running around the backyard pretending to be Rambo.  But as I grow older, I cannot understand why Rambo fans want to defend this film.  Whereas the first film had interest, the next two films completely lose it.  \\"First Blood\\" had an interesting Vietnam vet dealing with issues in the states.  Stallone's acting in the final scene of that movie actually is a credit to his ability.  But this film...well...they might as well have called it \\"Rambo Takes On Vietnam\\" or \\"Screw the Plot, More Action.\\"  While this film tries to recapture a bit of the first film's message, particularly in a few monologues that speak to the hopelessness of the Vietnam situation, it quickly descends into a bloodbath.  Rambo starts using rockets and explosives to take out single enemy soldiers-the very definition of overkill.<br />Two scenes do create particular delight for me, however.  The scene in which Rambo emerges from a muddy embankment and the scene in which he calmly takes out the Vietnamese captain with a single arrow, despite multiple bullets being hurled his direction.  These scenes must be watched over and over again, if only for their hilarious content.<br />All in all, I think it's important for anyone to see the entire trilogy-if only for completion's sake.  Just don't expect to find anything remotely close to the first film.
0061015725|3.0|Prey is your typical Crichton novel High on the scale of tension. And as with most of his books, it'll probably give me some frightening (or at least incredibly creepy) nightmares for a few nights. If you liked Sphere (the novel- no one liked the movie) this one will meet or surpass your expectations.<BR>Unfortunately, it is slightly crippled by the first person perspective. In hindsight I can see why this approach was taken, but...<BR>My other minor qualm, it seemed too easy to figure out what was going on. Now, I don't pride my logistic skills. My problem-solving abilities leave something to be desired. However, I was a step ahead of the main character almost the entire book. But maybe I'm just starting to know Crichton's writing style a little too well.<BR>As with Timeline, the ending makes you look back and notice more than a few plot holes as well as raise nagging questions, in a story that had, until that point, been airtight. The unneccessary commentary on the last paragraph gives you that queasy Outer Limits/Twilight Zone kinda feeling.<BR>I enjoyed the book and think every Crichton fan should give it a   try. Just don't expect too much.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|\\"The Italian Job,\\" in many ways, seems to remind me of a sequel to \\"Ocean's Eleven.\\"  Get together an interesting, big name cast and assign them each a specialization.  Launch this talented group of individuals into a world of immense action and crime in which the cops and authority seem to hold no place-the battle is purely between the \\"good\\" bad guys and the \\"bad\\" bad guys.  I enjoyed this film, but not as much as \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" or even \\"Sneakers\\"-another film with a somewhat similar premise.<br />Although I don't think I'm as harsh as some others have commented, I wasn't particularly impressed with the acting in this film.  I was expecting more from Edward Norton, but perhaps the role just didn't allow for anything.  The action sequences in this film are good and I was particularly impressed with the helicopter scene-the flying is incredibly difficult to pull off and, as the special features inform us, was not added with computer graphics.  The special features on this disc are not anything special.  I watched all of the little short documentaries on the various aspects of the film.  While they are interesting and provide some insight into the making of the film, there really isn't a whole lot to say about a pure action film.<br />While it's not as good as \\"Ocean's Eleven,\\" the film is still worth a look if you're interested in those types of movies.  Grab some popcorn, turn off your brain, and enjoy little Mini-Coopers drive around the screen.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV is the band's most popular album and one of the best hard rock releases of all time. While their second album concentrated on heavy rock with memorable riffs and their third album was largely comprised of acoustic tracks, Led Zeppelin IV combines the best of both worlds. Quite simply there is not a weak moment on the entire album. &quot;Going To California&quot; and &quot;The Battle Of Evermore&quot; are great acoustic tracks highlighting Robert Plant's excellent vocals. &quot;Rock And Roll&quot;, &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;, and &quot;Black Dog&quot; are hard rock classics with the latter containing one of the most memorable riffs in rock. &quot;When The Levee Breaks&quot; and &quot;Four Sticks&quot; are probably the least known songs here, but they're both excellent, with the former spotlighting the heavy drumming of John Bonham. Oh yeah, &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;, the most popular track in the history of classic rock, is here too. A timeless album that should be part of every music fan's collection. Highly recommended.
B0000640S1|4.0|\\"First Blood\\" has to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite action films of all time.  I believe that I enjoy it so much because it does a nice job of balancing action scenes with drama.  Thus, this film does not reek of the overkill violence that plagues the two sequels (as well as the films of other action stars).  Stallone actually does some acting in this film.  His performance as a Vietnam Vet come home to find a thankless country is compelling and his emotional breakdown near the end of the film is fantastic.  There is a lot of suspense in this film and the characters are certainly memorable.  Rambo has a clear enemy in this film, played by Brian Dennehy.  He is not taking on the country of Vietnam or the Russians-he is simply defending himself from a small-town cop.<br />My recommendation is to see this film and forget about the two sequels.  Of course, any die-hard Rambo fan will tell you that the action sequences only become better as the movies progressed, but they sacrifice much to do this in my opinion.  If you enjoy action films with a little class, you'll love \\"First Blood.\\"
B00005JM02|5.0|The more I think about it, the more fond I am of it. The movie's morality, classic storyline and flawed yet heroic characters... Finding Nemo is much more than just a parent son story.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I can't believe it.  At this price and this kind of dvd picture and audio quality, it's a steal.  Buy 2 or 3 and give them away!  Maybe now I can rest in peace without caring that this movie didn't make it into the Film Institute's top 100 movies or that Roger Ebert slammed it.  It's mine, all mine!
B000002H2H|5.0|Truly one of the greatest metal albums ever recorded. Nothing on this album can be labeled as a filler song.  This is what Metal is supposed to sound like. Many songs on this album have become classics since its debut. Any negative reviews that are written concerning this album shouldn't be taken seriously because it is flawless from beginning to end. Songs like Fade to Black, Creeping death and Ride the Lightning really add to the album's greatness. All albums of metallica starting from Kill em ALL to the black album should also be considered, all of em are truly great.

This disc with a glass of wine is as close to nirvana as this DC chick may ever get.<br />I first discovered Hartman after reading Billy Collins' poem, &quot;Nightclub&quot; which describes the voice as curling through the air like smoke from a cigarette someone left burning on a baby grand at 2am.<br />Listen to &quot;Beautiful&quot; and just thank your lucky stars for life and love and Hartman.

B000089RVX|3.0|I see so many people on here trying to rip this band for what you perceive them to be...&quot;goth&quot;, &quot;nu metal&quot;, etc...<br />Who cares ???<br />For God's sake, get a life, you miserable idiots !<br />This is their FIRST ALBUM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could.<br />It is not perfect by any means, but it shows an enormous amount of promise, and I'm sure their follow up will be much more complete, and not as raw.  They are learning on the fly.<br />The standouts are &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and the amazing &quot;My Immortal&quot;, which is undeniably a great song, and one of the most touching ballads I've heard in a long time.<br />The reason EVANESCENCE has hit it big, and these other bands I hear you people comparing them to haven't, is simple:<br />They haven't released songs as good as BRING ME TO LIFE, which despite being wildly overplayed, is a groundbreaking song and earned them the acclaim and success they've received.<br />The first time I heard that song, I knew immediately that I had never heard anything like it before.<br />I find it very difficult to have such strong opinions (good or bad) about a band that just made their debut album.<br />I think the sky is the limit for Evanescence, especially with the extraordinary talent of Amy Lee at the helm.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|If anyone in these reviews says Britney cannot sing then they are just Britney haters and use this reason since they have no other reason to hate her.  She is beautiful, healthy, can dance like no other, wrote over half the album, and can sing.  I didn't say shes the best singer but she can sing.  How would someone be signed to a record label if they cannot sing.  People are just too ignorant to get in her zone and are afraid to admit it.  I'm in college and had Me Against the Music first and played it right away.  Everybody loved it and asked who is was.  I was like new Britney and they said well its really good.  Seeing is not believing.  If she lipsyncs a dance track, you try doing what she does and sing the song.  You probably look more stupid than a person on Jackass.  <br />The album is amazing with a different sound on each song.  The best producers wanted to work with Britney and did to make amazing songs.  It was her 4th number one album and Me Against the Music was a top ten hit on radio.  She is not fading but evolving as everyone does.  Stop the BS and believe in BS(Britne Spears)!  She has us all in her zone.  Like that!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|\\"Requiem for a Dream\\" offers an absorbing, terrifying, yet fascinating look at the downward spiral associated with drug addiction.  While the picture certainly doesn't tell us anything we don't know already, it is an unflinching look at the possible consequences of drug addiction.  Amazingly enough, while you certainly don't condone even the reasons (excuses?) of each circumstance, you cannot help but feel empathy for the four lives depicted.<br />The standout performance, hands down, is Ellen Burstyn who was cheated out of an Oscar.  Her performance is quite simply spellbinding.  Even more so are the supporting players, most notably, Marlon Wayans.  Because he has previously been cast in comedic roles, it is quite surprising how well he handled such a dramatically demanding role.  He should invest in more dramatic parts as he proved to match his stellar cast members.<br />This is one of those movies where you immediately need to take a walk and \\"shake it off\\" or merely have a nice long cigarette.  This is an intense movie experience following the results of drug addiciton on 4 hapless souls.  Even more harrowing is that the movie offers not one shred of hope.  In that instance alone, it should be applauded because it implies there is no hope as long as you do not posess enough responsibility to recognize dangerous behavior and do something about it.<br />I highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JM20|3.0|Rowan Atkinson can turn average material good and good material great. In this case, it's average material that he elevates to good. While many of the jokes are predictable and the humor not terribly sophisticated in the way that Blackadder or Monty Python often provide, Johnny English nevertheless made me laugh out loud more than once, largely due to the excellent delivery and timing of Rowan Atkinson. There is a lot of fun physical humor similar to what one might expect from Atkinson's Mr. Bean or Peter Sellers playing Inpsector Clouseau.<br />Of course, the slapstick silliness of it all means that many kids will enjoy this, especially if they've seen a few classic James Bond movies first and part of the fun of this movie can be watching it with your children just as sharing the original James Bond movies with them can be a fun shared experience for those of us who grew up watching Sean Connery as 007. Much in the way that Peter Sellers made the more average entries in the Pink Panther series worth watching, Rowan Atkinson does the same for this film. Not as funny as it could have been, but funny nevertheless. If you need a light laugh to cheer you up and there are no Three Stooges shorts handy, this film will provide a lot of the same kinds of laughs.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I first heard about this movie, I was in a comic book store,had to check it out for myself. Just the title of this film tells you that this is going to be one of those movies that will blow you away. This film is cut up in 3 sections,&quot;Summer&quot;,&quot;Fall&quot;,and &quot;Winter&quot;. This film focusus on 4 main characters and how their lives go from good,to just hanging on to the hard wretching fall. In the very beginning &quot;Sarah Goldfarm&quot; is one of those ladies who is lonely and recently lost her husband &quot;Seymour&quot;.She finds some great news that she has been selected to be on television.She becomes obseseed with fiting in her red dress she wore back in her son's high School graduation she will do anything.&quot;Harold&quot;,&quot;Sarah's&quot; son, is a dope fiend and tries to do whats best for his mother and his girlfriend &quot;Marion&quot;,he was told not to use the same arm to shoot up with.Its too late for him to change things...his life will now drastically change. 'Marion&quot;, &quot;Harold's&quot; girlfriend is to the point where she doesn't want to be with her parents,and just wants to be with &quot;harold&quot;. She too is a dope fiend will do anything to get money when times are getting tough,soon at the end she will realize the fear of being alone.&quot;james&quot; i believe thats what his name is,he strives on making things work,so he could go head the road to the easylife,he realizes,that he better stop what he's doing or his life will quikly end.I noticed in this film,it showed shots of him and his mother meaning,he can't depend alot on himself without thinking back of his mother comforting him during his troublesome times or pain of lonliness. This film is brillant,and the camera shots and angles fit right with this film.The music,all together really fits how the movie is played out.I did notice during 'Summer&quot;,&quot;fall&quot;and &quot;Winter&quot; you see how thing in the beginning are going well,then begin to fall,towards the end,suddenly thing turn for the worst.When &quot;Sarah&quot; is hooked on them pills,she doesn't listen,in the end its too late for her,she put away and taking &quot;EST&quot;. &quot;Harold&quot; is told to quit doing the drugs,in the arm his arm is amputated.&quot;James&quot; thinks he can make it out there selling and buying drugs,when in fact he has a close encounter of death himself,but is sent to jail for a longtime in the end.&quot;Marion&quot; thinks things are going great but she winds up taking things for granted,and ends up being alone.I love how this movie focuses on these main four characters,this film is supurb,wonderful,just what they went through makes me feel sorry,and sad.This film is brillant and tragically sad,somewhat disturbing.......all in all very powerful and tragic!!!
0374172897|3.0|I can't share the excitement over this book.  It just didn't live up to its press.  And didn't anyone catch the references to Doris Lessing's story, To Room Nineteen?  About a woman who must rent a motel room to have some time alone.  You see, this book is well enough written, hence the three stars, but so unoriginal it's discouraging how much people have applauded it.  I do think the author has a great novel in him somewhere.  It's just not this one.  He needs to let go of his literary diva worship and take the plunge into originality.  I know... he's laughing all the way to the bank, but that's my opinion.
0808519387|5.0|This book provided me with the insight I needed to change my life. I feel better about my-self and now I understand my-self in a way I never thought possible. This is a truly great read for anyone who is up to the challenge of changing. I recommend this book to anyone that ever hopes to achieve freedom and to anyone that would like to understand what freedom truly is.
B00000JCB2|5.0|If there's anyone out there who doesn't own a Limp Bizkit album, this is the one to get.  Forget &quot;Results May Vary&quot; and &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water,&quot; this is the real Limp Bizkit right here.  Other than Linkin Park, I've never heard better rap-rock before.  &quot;Three Dollar Bill Y'all&quot; is also a recommendation for the ones who like the old school Bizkit (like myself).  But this is their best album by far.  If you feel you need to get more Bizkit, THEN go buy the newer stuff, but make that your last resort.  &quot;Significant Other&quot; is the peek album of Bizkit's career, so you should listen to it and enjoy it!
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was an excellent novel because of its distinct feminine superiority. Elizabeth Bennet, being the heroine in the novel, was a great character to whom women can relate. Her clever, independent quallities are what makes Elizabeth such an admirable character. My favorite chapter would be chapter eleven, volume two. This chapter is when Mr. Darcy proposes to Lizzy, and he expresses his feelings to her for the first time. Thisis my favorite chapter because of the way Lizzy refuses Mr. Darcy's proposal. She wasn't intimidated by Mr. Darcy's arrogance and his billowing attitude or his wealth. Not only did she decline his offer of marriage, but she criticized him for all his faults of pride and prejudice. This book is appropriate for ages fifteen and up because of its complex speech. The one literary device that I appreciate was irony. I found it ironic that a prideful, arrogant man would fall in love with an independent, strong willed woman. It was ironic that Elizabeth could see Mr. Darcy's faults of pride and prejudice but not see it in herself. Austen was able to use this irony to create the plot of the story. I enjoyed this novel because of the way it was written, the characters, and the relationship between the characters, especially the relationship between Mr. Dary and Elizabeth. The way that Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth despise each other at the beginning and later realized their true feelings for each other was very romantic. It was an explicit novel that I believe anybody who enjoys reading would enjoy.
B00000IOSU|5.0|After listening to this cd time and time again, I feel that it is one everyone should have the privelage of hearing. Sarah's intricate lyrics and smooth, but moving, voice literally come to life in this cd. If you missed the concert or are just interested in the music, either way its a great buy. I assure that you will be pulled into her whirlwind of emotions and just want more after its all over. Its WONDERFUL!!!!!
B000088E6M|1.0|I don't understand how anyone in their right mind can even put 50 Cent in the category of being a rapper nevermind and emcee. He has no talent. His lyrics, if you want to even claim that they are lyrics get old immediately and aren't original. Not to mention 1/2 the time he doesn't even make sense. I.E. in P.I.M.P, and I quote \\"I'm your friend, father, and confidant\\" Since when do pimps claim that they're your friend or father nevermind confidant? Real pimps just use their hoes. This guy is a fraud. Plain and simple. All he talks about is getting shot. I can't believe how blind everyone is. People who think this is good music just have no clue what they are talking about. 50 knows he's a bull$hit rapper, but why does he care, he's laughing all the way to the bank. Not one song on this album is worth listening to. Out of the whole album the thing worthy of letting your ears hear is Eminem's verse in \\"Patiently Waiting\\". What's the golden rule? Never let someone outshine you on your own track. And oh my god it's not even close. 50 shouldn't even have one line in that song he's that piss poor compared to Eminem. As far as I'm concerned Obie Trice is a better rapper than this clown, and he's pretty much close to as bad as it gets. This CD has been out too long for my review to thwart anyone from purchasing this album, but if you did buy it, I honestly think you could have burned your $ and still got more out of it. 50 cent is the reason I don't listen to the radio anymore, because he pollutes the airwaves with this pure garbage. Hopefully by the time he tries to release his 2nd or 3rd album he'll be completely forgotten. Somebody please help the mainstream rap industry.
B0000028MA|4.0|What got me into this Singles soundtrack was that i had heard that there was some unreleased Pearl Jam tracks.  I went to my local A&B sound and checked it out.  I saw a track by Alice in Chains (but i already had Dirt), a Chris Cornell track, a smashing pumpkins, and a soundgarden one.  Seeing these bands i liked i decieded i might as well give it a try. This cd opened my eyes to other bands like the screaming trees, mother love bone, and mudhoney.  All of the tracks by the bands i stated above were great songs, along with the song by jimi hendrix, and the love mongers do a fantastic cover of a fantastic zeppelin song. <br />     The biggest downside to this CD is the 2 songs by Paul Westerberg.  I heard them and almost thought that they were a joke.  Both of those songs are extremly poppy, with the chorus of Dylexic Heart being \\"na, na na na, na, na na na na na\\".<BR>     <BR>     With that said having 11 out of the 13 songs is still good and all of the other songs make up for it.  I would suggest this CD to any fan of the \\"grunge\\" area, any rock music from the early 90's, or being a fan of any of the bands stated above (besides paul westerberg.  This is the only soundtrack i have ever thought of buying and i never regretted it.  (The minus one star is for the 2 paul westerberg songs)
B0000VCZKM|5.0|The only reason I'm gonna get the Annie DVD is because of the band PLAY. They totally rock and I can't wait until it comes out. Play is the best band and if you haven't heard of them, then you should really check em out. I'm a huge Play fan and am so excited that they are doing something like this again.
B0000029GA|5.0|When nas dropped &quot;Illmatic&quot; in 1994 he dropped one of the best lyrical performances in hip hop history. This 9 song plus an intro 40 minute album is filled with intelligent thought provoking lyrics from a young hungry MC over smooth beats. Nas' story tales sound fresh from the street and his flow is so incredibly smooth. There are not too many unnecessary guest appearences, but the two notable ones are outstanding and they come from AZ on &quot;Life's a B**ch&quot; and Q-tip on &quot;One Love&quot;. Az's appearence is outstanding and he more then adds to the greatness of the track sounding just as hungry as nas with a powerful flow. With Q-tip, he adds a chourus which like AZ in his appearence, it adds to the song but in a different sense. Q-tip also produced the track. The beats are not repetitive either, a song like &quot;Halftime&quot; is an uptempo song with a fresh party beat but nas does not minimize the song with watering down the lyrics for the radio, he brings it just as hard as any of the songs on the album and it is actually one of the best on the album. A more laid back song with a mellow beat is &quot;memory lane&quot;, on this track you can really notice nas' smooth easy going flow as he spits over the relaxing beat. Two harder tracks is the incredible &quot;N.Y State of Mind&quot; and &quot;Represent&quot;. On &quot;N.Y State of Mind&quot;, nas opens up the album with a song that immeadiately pulls in and sets you up for the rest of the album. The song has a bass pounding beat and gets you into his mind set in the streets. &quot;Represent&quot; has nas with a tone that is slightly angry but it doesn't take away from the lyrical performance, he brings it just like he had done throughout the album. The best song on the album and one of the best tracks ever is &quot;It Ain't Hard to Tell&quot;. It is a thought provoking epic with nas spitting his usual fire, and the lyrics are mostly a freeverse. The beat is very good using an old sample whichbrings it all together. There is almost no denying the greatness of &quot;Illmatic&quot;. Unfortuneately, nas was never able to repeat the greatness of this album but he did have some other good work, notably &quot;It Was Written&quot;. But repeating the sucess of this album is nearly impossible and a high level of expectations was given to him. If you do not have this album already and you are a true hip hop fan, pick it up, it can make almost anyone a nas fan.
0739307312|5.0|The DaVinci Code is an exceptionally written and deceptive story that takes you through the twists and turns of a mystery that keeps you on your toes the entire time.<br />Sophie Nevue is a DCPJ cryptologist, which is someone who deciphers codes.  She was raised by her grandfather, Jacues Sauniere.  They had a fall out when Sophie was in college and accidentally saw something unforgivable.  She hadn't talk to her grandfather in 10 years until a picture of him dead was sent to her at the DCPJ lab which had a code next to him.  The last line of the code clearly had the words saying, P.S. Find Robert Langdon.  As a young child her grandfather had called her Princess Sophie so she new that she had to find Robert and figure out what he was trying to tell her.<br /> Robert Langdon is a Harvard symbologist who has published many books.  Robert and Sophie play a cat and chase game with Bezu Fache, the head of the DCPJ police who believes Robert to be the killer.  Fortunately Jaques had left many clues that all were interconnected and made the path for Sophie and Robert to find out the truth about her deceased family and how to find the most sought after possession for over 200,000 years.<br /> As they make there way from place to place they find out that Jaques was part of a secret society, which were the protectors of the possession.  By the end of the story they have the power to keep the secret that has lasted since Christ's death or to change history for ever.  Robert and Sophie meet many people that help them but at the same time make it that much harder to find whatever Jaques intended for them to find.  Dan Brown, the author, is able to lead you in one direction and then completely change it to the point that you are completely baffled.  After finding out the history and the intelligence of Jaques Sauniere you think of him as a wonderful and powerful man that you would be honored to meet.  The book has so many twists that there isn't a point in the book that you aren't fully intrigued.  Another part of this book that stunned me is how much I learned about  Jesus and the sought out possession as well as the true meaning of signs we use today.  Over all this book is incredibly well written and beats all other books that I have read in the past.  Dan Brown was able to combine history into a thrilling mystery.<br /> I don't have any complaints about the book at all because you couldn't tell what was going to happen in the future and you learn many things about the history of paintings and unknown facts about famous people.  The one small change that I would have is that there is a code towards the end of the book which dumfounded Robert and a man who has devoted his life to learning about the possession and trying to find it.  It was easy for even me to figure it out.  But that only lasted maybe a page and didn't have any affect on the book.  From beginning to end this gripping story of two young, intelligent people seeking for the most powerful object in the world is believable and amazing.  Dan Brown did an exceptional job and The DaVinci Code is sure to be a Pulitzer Prize winner.  I would recommend this book to anyone who really wants to hear a story which will mislead you, interest you, and teach you all in an amazingly written novel.'t fully intrigued.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is a book that most American students will have to read. And for good reason; Lee writes in such a way that there are no lies and only truths. She writes from the perspective of an eight year old girl, who is, if nothing else, a tomboy. She describes the most subtle extremes that only children would see that way. It is the perfect story of a family in the south, where prejudice is the story of the peoples' lives. The book doesn't hint where the plot is going or what it is, it just happens. This book is great, and I suggest all students should read it if they already haven't.
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an excellent novel written in the 19th century about the hardships of love, pride, and prejudices.<br />  My favorite chapter in Pride and Prejudice is Chapter 8, Volume 1. In this chapter, Elizabeth goes to visit her sick sister, Jane, at the Bingley's estate and during her stay at Netherfield, Caroline continues to insult her. ELizabeth, being the head-strong, outspoken person she is, became fed up with Caroline's constant insultsand began to reciprocate in the same manner and made Caroline feel foolish.<br />  Pride and PRejudice is a great, romantic classic that most people would enjoy. In my opinion, this particular novel is directed towards a more mature audience. Because of the sophisticated language and the constant event change, I also think that this novel should be read at a high school level or higher, depending on the person's own reading level and his/her understanding of the use of language in the 19th century.<br />  One literary device that I appreciate is the external conflict between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. At first Elizabeth &quot;could hardly stand to be in the same room as him,&quot; but as the plot progresses, she and Mr. Darcy become infatuated with each other and will not speak of their hidden feelings.<br />  I enjoyed this novel because it challenged my mind. It made me wonder what role women play in today's society: it has indeed changed dramatically, but the process has been slow. The novel forced me to think about my past predilections and the disorder they caused in my life.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|ok ive been reading what people saying about this ablum. &quot;it's too heavy&quot; &quot;not to standards&quot; blah blah blah. thats what they were going for in this album and i think its great,i love the heavyness in this one. And people say they went backwards in their musical career thats alot of BULL. I truly recomend this album for the true dream theater fan.

The Halloweeners in town gather for a celebration as done in the various years. This particular year, however, Jack stumbles across Holiday Doors, and learns about Christmas.

0486266885|5.0|The 'Strange Case Of Dr. Jerkyll And Mr. Hyde' by Robert Louis Stevenson, the same author to bring us 'Treasure Island' and 'Kidnapped', seems to be a basic good vs. evil within the soul of man.  Yet Dr. Jerkyll's problems dealing with the evil within turns out LESS than basic.  In fact, while Jerkyll fights the evil it seems to grow, becoming stronger.  Near the end Mr. Hyde is not only larger than before but seems to be able to appear at will.  Yet this is not a DIFFERENT person, both men are the same, sharing the same desires.<br />Within each of us is a Hyde who wants to strike out, to crush those who hurt us or make fun of us.  Why else would we love all those action flicks?<br />This is a timeless theme and something everybody has to deal with.
0446677450|5.0|I have been away from this website for nearly a year but find it laughable that the one and only basher of Robert Kiyosaki now has his very biased, negative and bullcrap review #1 with over 2,000 helpful votes? WOW! Holy Hupalo! I didn't know you could vote for yourself that many times.     Nonetheless, it shows that his rantings and constant voting for his own review are basically meaningless. Rich Dad Poor Dad continues to be a best seller. People who have read and applied the techniques continue to rave about the book and even here at [...], the book still is in the top 30. WOW! That is especially significant knowing how certain people have manipulated book rankings in the past here.    Well enough of that. All I want to say is that I have met persoanlly too many people who have benefitted enormously from the ideas in Rich Dad Poor Dad to give this book anything less than FIVE STARS!!!! FIVE STARS!!! But I do believe that Aamzon should go back to giving TEN STARS. Rich Dad Poor Dad is that good and is deserving of at LEAST TEN STARS!    That said, now watch all of the negative and unhelpful votes pile up  on my review by one person who doesn't seem to realize that nobody cares about his stupid review, most I am sure, ignore it and realize that he is probably and undoubtably, \\"mentally challenged.\\"     Thank you RICH DAD!
B000069AUI|4.0|A great CD is quite hard to come by these days. I was skeptical when I bought the CD. I had heard &quot;The Scientist&quot; on the radio, which was completely mesmerizing. &quot;The Scientist&quot; is probably the stand-out track on the CD, but is laden with a supporting cast of masterpieces. &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot;, &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, and &quot;Green Eyes&quot; are among the ear candy that awaits you. If you like U2, R.E.M., Radiohead, etc., then you will love Coldplay.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|After listening to this CD, I think you have to be a \\"hard-core\\" Britney fan in order to like it and to give it 5 stars. I like her first album, but after she declared to be a \\"mature\\" woman (actually her behaviors & music declare more immaturity than ever), her music starts going downhill real fast.  The music of this CD shows no signs of maturity, the maturity Britney talks about means exposing more of what/who she really is instead of growing up.  I think her first album is the most decent one among all her albums; if you already have it, then you have it all. Don't need to waste a penny on this CD. If there's a CD rental store, this CD should be a rental and not meant to be owned. Because you'd probably just listen to it once....and that's hard enough. Listen to samples before you actually pay for it...you will definitely regret if you're not a hard-core Britney fan. <br />Btw, what's up with the heavy nasal sounds?? I find that very annoying! Stop using your nose to sing!
B00002DEQQ|5.0|here's MY experience with this album: the guy at the record shop told me: buy this for your old lady. he knew she liked elvis and other acts of that kind, so i did. i brought it home, she listened to it and every track she heard she said: aw i don't know, this isn't quite what i like. this isn't the tom jones i remember. and her fifteen-year-old daughter sitting beside her was going: oooh tom jones- cool. and every track she was listening to  she was going, oooh i must have this -- so naturally she made about 15 copies for herself and all her friends. my old lady never warmed to the thing, and gave it back to me. i could never STAND tom jones, so i didn't listen to the record all that often, if at all. then i got mick jagger's &quot;angel at the doorway&quot;, and i thought: what a let-down. tom jones did a better job than this. i mean, EVEN tom jones. so i picked the cd back out from the never-listen-to-this-****-bin i'd consigned it to and hey, bingo! it really gooo-roooved. i've been enjoying it tremendously ever since, i've got the whole thing inside my imac and come across it frequenly without ever pressing the &quot;get rid of this&quot;-button. mick jagger will have to try really hard to catch up! so if you guys in america haven't got this cd on the market as a regular day-to-day available everywhere item, boy, you're really missing out on something. it's the only one of its kind that i know that actually works, where a semi-past it male bullfrog type of singer gets a new lease of life through a cooperation with younger artists. the music, the arrangements, and the actual songs are great too, ranging from an obscure elvis track to gospel, from modern pop to frivolous tin pan alley. and it actually works, it's fun to listen to. i could never understand why frank zappa, of all people, the most exacting task-master of american pop, liked tom jones but here it's obvious: he's a tremendous musician and singer, not just a shlock artist!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This Britney C.D. is great. Her vocals are differenciated in each song. I don't care what people say about it. I personally think that it's a wonderful C.D. and I'd say it's mature and is a work of art but if you aren't into club and dance music and soft ballads then I wouldn't recommend it. Even though you don't like that type of music I'm sure you'll like at least one of her songs on this C.D. It's eclectic mix of beats, vocals, and lyrics. So hey britney I think you're ready!!
B000002H6C|5.0|The sophistication and complexity of this album alone is astounding.  The cynical yet truthful lyrics strike deep politically, and the gut wrenching guitars layered with violent and fast drums provided by the masters Kirk and Lars are simply fantastic.  The digital guitar sound is surreal, and I do not believe that any other band has even come close to perfecting the sound of the solos that are found here.  Sure, that sound very well could have been accidental (Due to the lack of bass) but I adore it, even more so than any of the other solos done by Metallica.<BR>     Gritty, real, lyrically precise and relevent still to today, Metallica's ...And Justice For All cannot be considered anything else other than a masterpiece.  Even though all the songs are six, seven, or eight minutes long, there's really nothing on here that's tedious or boring.  It's hard to comprehend how they accomplished this, especially with a genre as repetitive as thrash, but they did it.  Not only that, but they made an intellectually nerve wracking experience, opening your mind with shocking and emotionally draining words spilled out by the charismatic frontman known as James Hetfield.  His growl is fierce, (Duh, it's an old Metallica album, what'd you expect?) and his feelings and political opinions expressed on the album protest...lots.  <BR>     The drums often sound like Lars is doing nothing more than beating on a plastic barrel with butterknifes, yet I love it.  It just adds to the claustrophobic and powerful feel of the whole thing, which was a necessity for the beauty of this album.<BR>     Bass?  Where is it?  Who cares?  Get over it. I think it would have almost weighed the music down.  It just goes to show that a band does not need a bass player in order to make great music.  Plus, the production is still top-notch, without sounding glossy clean.<BR>     If you haven't experienced this yet, please do.  You will not regret it, I can assure you of that.
0812550706|3.0|It was a real page-turner. The charm of the book lays mostly in character development (Ender's and Valentina's - others are mostly cardboard) and vivid and somewhat gruesome descriptions on the here-and-now events. The book is flawed though by the mostly linear storyline and sickeningly melodramatic ending with an Alaska-sized logical hole. Nevertheless, quite recommended for the fans of hero-based sci-fi.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I'm giving this new mix 4 stars, whereas the original Let It Be would get 3½. The new track order is better, and the sound is very clear. However, if you own the Phil Spector-produced original and The Beatles Anthology 3, I think this new mix is mostly superfluous.<br />Get Back, Dig A Pony, For You Blue, Two Of Us, I've Got A Feeling, One After 909, and I Me Mine, all sound substantially the same as the classic Let It Be CD. The sound is undeniably cleaner, and Ringo's drums seem to have more kick, but on I've Got a Feeling, the engineers have removed the some of the necessary bite from the electric guitars. Solo instruments are mixed lower in volume, like the slide guitar on For You Blue. The new &quot;Naked&quot; mix giveth, and the new mix taketh away. <br />Don't Let Me Down was always a throwaway song to me, and its inclusion here doesn't add any value. The version on The Beatles' Past Masters Volume Two is sufficient, and probably superior. <br />Anthology 3 was mostly a collection of archival junk that should have stayed archival, but it contains George Martin's remixes of The Long And Winding Road and Across The Universe that beat the Naked remixes.  George Martin was a genius, and the team of producers for Let It Be...Naked cannot match his judgment. <br />I am forced to conclude that the only song on Let It Be...Naked that substantially bests previous versions is the rousing Let It Be, which now closes out the set in the new track ordering. But even this track is marred by a lackluster George Harrison guitar solo, clearly inferior to the solo on the original CD and the other solo that graced the original single.<br />This is a fine purchase for those who do not own the first &quot;overproduced&quot; version of this album. For Beatles fans who already own the previously released versions of these tunes, it hardly seems worth the bother. At the very least, it would be wise to borrow a friend's copy before paying good money to go... Naked.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|I think this album is great. Whitney has a very strong voice on this cd.  What I love the most is how she gave the old classic life, and made a great new cut &quot;One Wish&quot; which will soon be a classic Christmas ever year around. All in all I think this album is wonderful, and a must have for the holiday cd collector! Nobody can do it like Whitney!
B00009V7RF|5.0|THIS IS AN EXCELLENT ALBUM. TRACK 13....RAISE THE VOLUME AS FAR AS THE WALLS WOULD BEAR...AND EXPERIENCE ULTIMATE ENJOYMENT!!
B00000AFGM|5.0|This album is musically brilliant! Gary Glitter/David Bowie esque glamrock, with a slight electrosynth tinge.... ITS GOOD!<br />However, it is in the storyline where we find the brilliance on the record. Manson plays two characters in this, these being the \\"Marilyn\\" or good side, called Alpha, and the \\"Manson\\" or dark side, called Omega. Even though the caracters are the same person, they represent opposite sides of the personality, with Alpha being naieve, hopeful and somewhat charitable, whilst Omega is a cynical, bitter manic-depressive addicted to every drug in California.<br />As for the songs....<br />1. Great Big White World: Genuinely goregous glam track, sung by Alpha, as he is horrified by the conformity of our world.<BR>2. The Dope Show: Musically brilliant, this lets us in on Omega's cynicism, and the emptiness of his fame.<BR>3. Mechanical Animals: Alpha dealing with the mechanical nature of this \\"Bride\\".<BR>4: Rock Is Dead: Industrio/Glam mixture, Omega bitching over the agonisingly ignorant criticism he recieves for being controversial. Damn catchy too.<BR>5. Dissassociative: Omega overdoses on drugs (again), obstensibly for his depression, and reverts to Alpha, seeing the world as a \\"Dead Astronaut\\". Very Bowie, and very good.<BR>6. Speed of Pain: Omega, now on a come down, vents his angst, and it is here where we first see his despiar.<BR>7: Posthuman: Alpha, infuriated at the superficiality of our world and our religion, reminds us of the Antichrist Superstar and tells us to wake up to our god being a Statistic.<BR>8: I want to dissapear: Omega, full of anger and frustration, blasts us in a punk sneer about how shallow he has become thanks to our screwed up society.<BR>9: I dont like the drugs: Omega makes fun of all those who have supposedly 'given up' their addictions, but really traded in the drugs for the church, ending up with another addiction.<BR>10: New Model: Omega raves about how the media is creating a new type of person, all shallow and\\"Homopolitan.\\"<BR>11:User Friendly: Omega is distraught, and now the sex is as mechanical as the people, with it being a weapon and not a f**kfest.<BR>12: Fundamentally Loathsome: Omega resolves to end it all, not knowing what is real emotion, and what is preprogrammed.<BR>13: Last Day on Earth: Omega reverts back to Alpha, and confesses his love for Coma White, and pledges eternal devotion. The most moving song on the album, and a good one too.<BR>14: Coma White: The death of our Heroine, exiled from society for the 'crime' of individuality. Tragic ending, but beautiful...<br />Overall, this is Marilyn Manson's masterpiece. The music is far more sophisticated (and more rock than metal) than any of his previous efforts, and it has some of his best songwriting ever. It is deeply intellectual, it sounds great, and works very well overall.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm sick of reading about people hating on Britney. All those people who says 'In The Zone' is bad, probebly didn't even hear it. Britney's 4th cd is her best, and one of the best pop cd's to come out this year. The songs on this cd are great, each one is unick and has it's own style. I recommend all of you to give this album a try. It won't hurt you to listen, and you'll probebly find yourself enjoyng it as much as I did. It's GREAT!
B00009TB5G|2.0|These movies are a rape of the books of Tolkien in so many ways that a book could be written about that alone. It no more resembles his works than Armageddon resembles Nasa's space program.<br />As for specifics: The characters in this movie don't even resemble Tolkien's in far too many cases. Scene after scene of places and events that weren't in the books and bad dialog writing not worthy of an Oxford scholar.<br />Christopher Tolkien in his wisdom said that he didn't believe that his father's books could or should lend themselves to be made into film. I heartily agree. Not with the film making of today. The visual effects may be up to par worthy of the scenes in the books but as long as there are writers and directors that don't care about the author's intent what's the point?<br />I don't understand why these directors, producers and writers have to dumb down a classic book for the masses. Especially since they have been so widely read. Were the millions who read the books too stupid to understand them so that Peter Jackson has to use cliche and exposition, not to mention characters and incidents that were not even in any of the three volumes, to explain to the dullards what is happening?<br />And to the reviewer from Canada-just because millions of people have loved these movies doesn't make them any better, just as millions of people that listen and love Britney Spears doesn't elevate that to art. Instead of trying to teach illiterates about books through movies how about teaching them to read and not be force fed crap. But I guess that is the socialist's way of doing things. Don't attack the real root of the problem, just dumb everything down for the masses. After all they are just sheep.<BR>I would give it one star but like I said, the visual effects are good.
B0000UMD00|5.0|I have always been impressed by Pink's voice, style, song-writing abilities and versatility. And her 3rd album did not cease to bring about the same reaction I'd had to her previous two. This album is- like the others- a mix of many different sounds including rock, R&amp;B, punk rock, and blues. This album has even more variety than some of the others- Pink tended to stick to upbeat songs, but she brings things down a few notches with songs like &quot;Waiting For Love&quot; and &quot;Save My Life&quot;. Pink demonstrates her unique but powerful vocal abilities on many of the songs, and just blows you away with the emotion and feeling in them. I bought albums by two of my favourite artists in the last quarter of 2003, but Pink's album far exceeded both of them. I have one thing to say about her album: Try This!
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Picked my copy up at Borders last night and I paid about $16 more.  Dooope!  Watched ALIEN Director's cut last night.  Given that Ridley Scott goes out of his way in print and on screen to say that he liked the theatrical release just fine but he added the deleted scenes and fixed some stuff at the request of the studio moguls so they could package these movies and take my money once again, the added scences add nothing and to this reviewer make the movie more disjointed and the &quot;remaster&quot; disappointing.  This is and was a great movie but...it doesn't hold up as well under scrutiny as it did in it's first run in '79(?).  Opening scene, the ship shakes on my 60&quot; screen. How did Dallas and Lambert get Kane back to the ship after getting face hugged? Why do they look for the chest buster alien for about 30 seconds before shooting Kane out into space wrapped up like a mummy and then go back and regroup and look for him some more?  What do Alien's eat to grow to full size in a few hours?  Why does it rain in the ship?  Why do they need bottles of coolant B4 they can get on the shuttle/lifeboat?  Do you really need coolant in space in an absolute vacuum?  Wouldn't the lifeboat already have whatever they needed on it?  Why do all 4 self destruct control rods go down when Rippley is trying to stop the self destruct and then we see at least one of them back up and her pushing the button inside of it?  <br />The best Alien movie is not a movie at all.  It was the book by Alan Dean Foster.  None of the problems of the movie.  Both are still great.  I can't wait to watch ALIENS tonight.  Buy the Quadrilogy here or used, don't go to Borders and pay to much, also the packaging stinks.  It's like a slinky.  And remember, &quot;In space, no one can hear you scream...after finding out you paid too much.&quot;
B00008J4P5|2.0|Everyone needs to quit saying that the white stripes are the best band ever, and that this is the best album ever, and that jack white is the most talented guy ever. this band, this album, and this front man, are not that good. everyone needs to admit that while the white stripes are a breath of fresh air on the radio these days, they are not actually that good. this album is perhaps an average rock album, but not genius by any stretch of the imagination. a lot of the songs sound the same. none of them are really that memorable. honestly. I own this album, if you don't, don't waste your time. buy something better.
B0000AMJED|1.0|Summary:<BR>Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is a former cop turned fugitive whose hobby happens to be racing cars.  Having left the L.A. area (the location of the first movie), he is finally caught in Miami.  But instead of sending him to jail, the authorities have a proposition for him - help them bring down local drug lord Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) and they'll forget about his criminal record.  Brian agrees, but only if he can choose his partner.  So he chooses an old friend from his childhood days in Barstow, CA, ex-convict Roman Pearce (Tyrese).<br />The DEA has an agent inside Verone's operation, Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes), who hooks them up with a job to drive for Verone.  But for some reason Verone has decided he is ready to leave the country, so he has only one job for Roman and Brian, pick up a bunch of cash and drive it to an airport where he can get out of the country.  Roman and Brian, who are constantly fighting their police and DEA handlers, pull a few tricks in the process.  The result, they pull off the job, get Verone his money, capture him, save Fuentes (who has fallen in love with Brian), and get away with some of the loot - what a surprise!<br />My Comments:<BR>Let's see, what does the movie have going for it... Story - terrible.  Acting - even worse.  Fast cars - nope.  What?  It doesn't even have fast cars?  Unless you consider 85 mph fast, nope.<br />The story is just plain silly.  To begin with, Brian apparently has a massive rap sheet, but he was a cop?  Um, are cops allowed to do that?  I don't think so.  Second, okay, let's pretend that the DEA would be willing to let Brian expunge his record in order to help them.  And let's pretend even further that they would be willing to let a violent ex-convict be his partner.  And let's pretend even further further that they would completely disregard that Brian and Roman break a gazillion laws every time they get in a car and that Roman shooting at a DEA agent at one point in order not to blow their cover is 'cool'.  With all of this pretending, I just could not keep pretending when the movie has a highly successful drug lord use two cop-attracting racing cars to transport his money.  I mean, I'm no drug lord, but if it were me, I'd use old women in Cadillacs; cops never pull them over.  This has to be the silliest premise for a movie I have ever seen.  The sole purpose is to present a situation where cars can go fast.  Who cares that it would never happen, right?  Well, why make it into a movie with the trimmings of a story if the story is so implausibly ridiculous that it would be better if it didn't exist?  I don't get it.<br />Another serious problem I had with the story and movie is the fact that every time you got more than one car racing lunatic together with another, it inevitably included about 100+ scantily clad women who were perfectly okay with the fact that they were just being used for their breasts and vaginas.  The car racing culture portrayed in this movie doesn't exist (if you believe it does, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you in Brooklyn...).  I'm supposed to believe that these women have nothing better to do with their time than sit around and watch people race cars, watercraft, etc. all day.  They don't work?  Please!<br />As far as the acting goes, this are B-movie actors.  No one is good.  But since this movie isn't about the story or the acting, just about portraying a non-existent racing culture and fast cars, it shouldn't matter.  But wait, the cars aren't fast...<br />So, what was up with the cars only doing 80 to100 mph?  I do 80 on my way to work in the morning.  Maybe I should take a camera with me and make a movie.  I drive a Honda Civic; does that mean I've got a racing machine?  Heck, I've even driven 120 mph (not on the way to work, but that's another story...), which was about the fastest I think I saw the speedometers go.  So, why is this movie called 2 Fast?  Ideally it would be in reference to the length of the movie,as it would be in its best interest to get it over with quick, before anyone realizes that what they just saw was ridiculously stupid.<br />Overall, I don't recommend this movie for anyone, except those people who actually believe their is a cool, car-racing underground culture where stuff like this actually happens.  Sure, people race cars, but do they gather around several thousand people and close down streets to do it?  Only if they are as stupid as the makers of this movie and want to go to jail.  Don't see this movie!
B00005JMTQ|4.0|Harry (Jack Nicholson) and his much younger girlfriend Marin (Amanda Peet) plan to spend a romantic weekend at Marin's family home in the Hamptons. But their plans go awry when Marin's mother Erica (Diane Keaton) and her aunt Zoe (Frances McDormand) show up unexpectedly. The couple is further foiled when Harry has a heart attack in Marin's arms. As Harry is unfit to travel, Erica reluctantly allows him to stay in her home while he recuperates.  Erica, who is an accomplished playwright and 50-something divorcee, and Harry, an aging confirmed bachelor who has always confined his romantic aspirations to women half Erica's age, find themselves both attracted to and repulsed by one another. And the friction between them may ignite an unexpected spark.<br />Let me first say that \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" elicited more laughs in the movie theater than any film in my memory. It's a good time at the movies. It's too bad that the movie runs too long and doesn't maintain its charm through the third act. It would be nice if the audience could leave the theater in as good a mood as they experienced for the first two-thirds of the movie. At about 2 hours long, \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is too long for a romantic comedy. It has a few subplots and a few acts too many. The film is charming enough and paced well enough to overcome it, but a tighter script would have done wonders. And although most of the film is hilarious, it loses a lot of its charm and humor after the action moves from the Hamptons to New York city.<br />The comedy and romance in \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" are, of course, derived from the notion that women of a certain age have a terrible time finding suitable men because the desirable men in that demographic date much-younger women. That's funny stuff, but it often seems like writer/director Nancy Meyers is trying to do more than entertain. She waves the older-women-can't-get-dates and older-men-who-date-younger-women-are-scum flags a little too high. And the repeated assertion that both old and young women are somehow victims of these aging Casanovas is insulting and, dare I say, inaccurate. This is a comedy; why not simply see the humor in the situation? It would be fine if the film said nothing. But mixed messages are a nuisance. Harry is chided for constantly cavorting with younger women, while Erica is congratulated when she does approximately the same thing.  And why are these people so preoccupied with the age of their mates anyway? It's tiresome.<br />\\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is undeniably funny but far from perfect. Erica's neuroses wear thin after a while. Harry is lovable when he's  lecherous, but trying when he's earnest. The film is too long. I didn't for a moment believe that Harry and Erica were actually compatible, but romantic comedies are contrived by definition. But ultimately a comedy is required only to be funny in order to succeed. And two thirds of \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is laugh-out-loud funny. Jack Nicholson deserves a lot of credit for being willing to look like a fool -and an old fool at that. There's some terrific physical comedy. I like the decision to use brief nudity  for comic effect. And Keanu Reeves does a nice job as a very handsome doctor who pursues Erica. It would have been better if some of the clutter had been cleared out, but smart writing and no-holds-barred performances make \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" a funny and enjoyable film for just about everyone.d assertion that both old and young women are somehow victims of these aging Casanovas is insulting and, dare I say, inaccurate.

B0000CABBW|5.0|Summary:<BR>The small town Maori culture in New Zealand in which Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes), a strong-willed 12 year-old girl is being raised is dying.  At least, that's the impression her grandfather, Koro (Rawiri Paratene) has.  Koro is the leader of the town, which is made up primarily of Maori people, and he is troubled by a number of things, not the least of which is the fact that his oldest son, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), who should be following in his place, is not.  Also, Porourangi's first born son, Paikea's twin, died in childbirth, along with Porourangi's wife.  Koro, who was expecting Porourangi's son to become the next leader of the town, has been in a slump ever since.  But the real problem is Paikea, Koro's vivacious granddaughter who feels the burden of the fact that she lived when Koro really wanted a grandson.  But Paikea isn't about to let her grandfather, who despite his initial lack of interest in her has now grown to love her, witness the decline of their culture.  But Paikea is a girl, and girls have never lead the town.  Thus, she has more to overcome than just learning the ways of the ancients, she also has to illustrate how she, as a female, can be a prophetess, lead the village, and get her grandfather to accept her role in the revitalization of the village.<br />Marshaling her Uncle Rawiri's (Grant Roa) talents and secretly supported by her grandmother, Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton), Paikea eventually teaches Koro a powerful lesson about the potential of women and the ways of the ancients.<br />My Comments:<BR>This is an incredible movie!  It uses a touching story to explore the clash between the old and new; between Westernization and Maori culture; between traditional patriarchy and gender egalitarianism.<br />The story is touching, convincing, and lucid.  I may have found it hard to critique the story line because I am so unfamiliar with the Maori culture, but I really couldn't see anything wrong with this story.<br />As for the acting, it was stunning.  I was absolutely astonished by the performance of Keisha Castle-Hughes.  Maybe she was just being herself or maybe she has incredible potential.  Either way, she was the perfect choice for this role and without her, this movie never would have worked.  The rest of the cast is also excellent.  I have absolutely no criticisms of the movie on this front; the acting is superb.<br />Everything about this movie draws you into the the world of the Maori people who, like many people around the world, are currently negotiating the clash of their culture with Western culture.   I would highly recommend this movie for everyone.
B0000DJZ9T|3.0|After being totally blown away by U2's latest concert DVD and David Gilmour's also, I was thoroughly disipointed with the audio of Coldplay Live 2003.  Very flat.  The audio engineer for this should be canned.  The film shot for this and the editing I thought were very good.  It's a shame that the sound quality couldn't compare.  It sounded as though certain parts were pumped up and others were toned down through the mix.  I'm sure the actural concert didn't sound this bad.  I haven't listened to the live CD yet.  I'm thinking it will sound better.  If I knew this DVD sounded so bad, I wouldn't have purchased it.  If I could get my money back, I would.  Love ya &quot;Coldplay&quot;, but the audio on this DVD sucks big time.
B000075BFK|5.0|What can i say.<BR>I head tupac a long time ago (me against the world) and i was kind of disspointed. but this album got me. all tracks are good but some are worth mentioning.<BR>Still ballin' : MY FAVOURITE<BR>My block : cool song<br />BUY THIS ALBUM. PROBABLY THE BEST RAP ALBUM EVER
B000087DRK|5.0|I was sucked into the maelstrom that is Turbonegro by the first track off this album: The Age of Pamparius.  There is so much complexity to this band, yet understanding is simple bacause all you really have to do is listen.  Euroboy's thunderous riffs are sublime, and Hank's hysterical lyrics give the music added legitamacy.  Don't pay too much attention to those homophobics (Ken B.) who fear Turbonegro because of their homoerotic lyrics.  This theme was created because it was the only thing that would &quot;strike fear&quot; into the hearts of the hardcore Norwegian death punk kids.  In addition, the theme was adopted long before the great american media acceptance of homosexuals.  So put aside your preconceptions and give Turbonegro a chance.  What you'll find inside is heavy hitting, body moving, head pounding rock n' roll.  Punk isn't dead, but Turbonegro isn't exactly punk.  They do put on the greatest live show around.

B00005JMTQ|4.0|Firstly, let me just say that I have never been a fan of Jack the sleazy, old, smug, bald, wifebeating, young-girl chasing (a la Woody Allen) Nicholson.  And after this movie, I'm still not.  Hollywood seems to love him (the man's won numerous oscars), and I just don't get it.  Maybe I'm not meant to.  That said, \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" was a good movie; well-conceived, clever, and well-directed.  Kudos for Nicholson willing to poke fun at his own age and the incredulity of him dating women young enough to be his daughter (dare I mention, \\"As Good As it Gets\\"?).  But he's still the oily sleazebag who thinks he's all that.  I don't think it's gonna change.<br />     The main conflict of the movie revolves around aging playboy Nicholson and young doctor Keanu Reeves both falling for, and competing for the love of Diane Keaton's character.  Keaton is absolutely radiant in this film, seething with feminine charm, with a beauty that seems to defy her age (unlike Nicholson).  Her eyes have never been more expressive, and I think in her younger days she would have played a perfect Elizabeth Bennet from \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  Keaton continues to amaze me as the most beautiful and charming woman over 50; in other words, way too good for Nicholson.  <br />     Keanu Reeves, on break after playing the Messiah Neo, makes a welcomed supporting appearance in this movie.  Reeves plays a handsome, young doctor every bit as suave as Nicholson, just minus the sleaze and dislikeability.  He's instantly smitten with Keaton's character and does his darndest to win her heart.  <br />     I did not spoil the movie's ending for you:  you already knew the ending, and I already knew the ending.  This movie is about Nicholson and Keaton, so of course they end up together at the end; the only mystery is how the plot ends up there.  Nevertheless, I gotta say the ending left me unsatisfied.  Incredulous to me that Keanu Reeves would loose to...that.  There was no doubt in my heart that Reeves'character would have made a far superior match with Keaton.  <br />     A professional reviewer from a newspaper claimed that Nicholson and Keaton had real chemistry and a believeable romance going, whereas Keaton's relationship with Reeves was farfetched.  I beg to differ.  To me, the Keaton-Reeves relationship was far more real and believeable.  The writers could have either made Reeves' character so minor that he served only as a plot device that no one cared about, or they could have let him \\"get the girl\\".  Instead they chose to flesh out his character just enough for us to care about him, and then leave him out in the cold at the very end.  I bet Reeves' character is wishing he never invited Nicholson to sit down at the table at that Paris restaurant.  <br />   Oh well, I had a good time.  As I said, it was a well-conceived and well-made movie.  Even Nicholson did a good job with his role; I just don't have like him for it.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|OK, let's be clear that I absolutely love the Beatles. The original Let It Be record was never my fave, though it had some great cuts on it to be sure. And it had a lot of sentimental value due to the timing in my life of when it came out, etc., just personal stuff you bozos couldn't care less about. To be honest, I haven't even heard this disc--and I don't need to. If you've seen the movie, or listened to the 8 zillion hours or so of crap Let It Be-era bootlegs that are out there, you've heard this stuff before. Personally, I never thought there was too much wrong with the original record. All the schmaltz on Long & Winding Road never bothered me that much because it's really not that great of a song anyway!!! (Sorry, Paulie) What should have happened here was this:  The original \\"Naked\\" versions, then the old soundtrack version, then a 2nd CD with the COMPLETE rooftop concert, and some highlights of the alternate takes, and how about the DVD of the movie as a co-release. Now THAT would be a package I'd run out to buy. Not this wimpy amputee. Oh, and the title--DUMB DUMB DUMB. The Beatles always had class--this was cheap and DUMB etc. As another reviewer opines, the Beatles really need a total makeover of the catalog. The versions we have are from the mid-80's. On the one hand, the Beatles have not engaged in the exploitation game of re-releasing their music 3 or 4 times,such as have Bowie, Costello, Hendrix, Stones--I mean, come on already!!! But I think they could use a one time new-do with really great extras & packaging, kind of like the Who have done with their \\"deluxe\\" editions. Maybe have one CD with the record and another with some live stuff, the Xmas records, out-takes, interviews. A class job, not the hack job of Let It Be Nek-ked. Forgive me boys!!!<br>PS from 4/8/04:  Wow!  How stupid of me to write a negative review of the Beatles! Of course, everyone wants to BUY BUY BUY anything that the Beatles Industry puts out--it does not matter if it is a scrambled rehash (the \\"1\\" record)...the travesty that is the Hard Day's Night DVD reissue...an incomplete, inferior version of the Washington D.C. concert...or this naked, amputated, un-generous offering of Let It Be. I mean, where is a DVD of \\"Help!\\" or \\"Let It Be\\" or \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\"? (Try pricing those out-of-print babies!) Where is \\"The Beatles at Hollywood Bowl\\" ? Or the Beatles Christmas shows? Or how about a DVD of the Shea Stadium show? Or an official \\"Bootleg\\" series like Dylan is putting out? Zillions of lemmings buy whatever crappy pablum the Beatles Industry puts out, but the Beatles Industry is sitting on some really great stuff that BELONGS TO THE WORLD!!! What are they waiting for? C'mon, Paul, Ringo, Yoko, and Olivia--RELEASE THE GOOD STUFF!!! GIVE THE FANS WHAT THEY DESERVE!!! PUT IT ALL OUT, LADS!!! Oh, and all you lemmings please make sure to vote \\"unhelpful\\" on your way over the cliff...
B00000J7S8|5.0|This is the very first album that I truly appreciated Diana Krall's vocal artistry. I have listened to her earlier recordings prior to this and I must say that this is *the* best from my Diana Krall collection. My number two choice is [[ASIN:B00005N9CV The Look of Love]].<br /><br />This Grammy-winning CD, \\"When I Look In Your Eyes,\\" won the \\"Best Jazz Vocal Performance\\" and was also nominated for \\"Album of the Year.\\" My congratulations to Diana Krall and everyone involved in this wonderful recording for a well-deserved recognition.<br /><br />With her sultry voice, commanding piano skills, and Grammy awards to add to her impressive musical qualities, Diana Krall is worthy to be considered as one of the modern day divas in the jazz scene today. This is a showcase of her most outstanding performances marked by elegance and a great sense of singing style so distinctively her own. What makes her an extraordinary performer is her ability to sing and play at the same time, and excel in both. What a great talent!<br /><br />The beauty of this album is also credited to the producers, Tommy LiPuma, David Foster and Johnny Mandel, who is also the album's brilliant and remarkable arranger/orchestrator, Eddie Karam, Al Schmitt and all the equally talented jazz musicians: Russell Malone (guitar), John Clayton (bass), Jeff Hamilton (drums), Ben Wolfe (bass), Larry Bunker (vibes), Lewis Nash (drums), Pete Christlieb (sax), Alan Broadbent (piano - track #13), Chuck Berghoffer (bass).<br /><br />This CD contains a repertoire of unforgettable classic standards from the Great American Songbook composed and penned by the most brilliant songwriters of all-time: George and Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Dorothy Fields, Harry Warren, Al Dublin, Jimmy McHugh, Ted Koehler and Harold Arlen, among others. And not to mention original songs written by Michael Franks and a budding songwriter, Clint Eastwood, \\"Popsicle Toes\\" and \\"Why Should I Care?\\" respectively.<br /><br />My top favorite is \\"Let's Face The Music And Dance\\" which she delivers enchantingly with a charming Bossa Nova arrangement. It is overwhelmingly impressive! It's absolutely the best rendition I have ever heard for this Irving Berlin gem of a song.<br /><br />Cole Porter's \\"I've Got You Under My Skin,\\" one of the widely-performed songs, is given the most mellow and softly sweet reading, thus, making it the album's emotional highlight. \\"I'll String Along With You\\" co-written by Harry Warren and Al Dubin, is such a notable song and one of my favorites from this bunch.<br /><br />\\"You may not be an angel<br />Cause angels are so few<br />But until the day that one comes along<br />I'll sing my song to you\\"<br /><br />With a collection of flawlessly interpreted songs, it's so hard to single out a favorite song for they are all my favorites, but the most stunning tracks include \\"East Of The Sun (West Of The Moon),\\" \\"Let's Fall In Love,\\" \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love,\\" \\"Pick Yourself Up\\"  and of course \\"Popsicle Toes.\\" (How can I forget this song when I was a huge fan of Michael Franks in the '80s? I have collected some of his remarkable albums since [[ASIN:B000002KCF The Art of Tea]]).<br /><br />This CD is a treasure and the more you listen to it, the more enjoyable your listening experience will be.<br /><br />* * * * * TEN STARS * * * * *Face The Music And Dance\\" which she delivers enchantingly with a charming Bossa Nova arrangement.

B0000013GT|5.0|ATLiens is a blend of funky beats and crafty wordplay from Big Boi and Dre. Southernplayalistic was a good way to begin their career really getting them on the map and Georgia too. I see that as their second greatest album ever. ATLiens is just too good, few songs on here are not considered \\"great\\" by every day standards. Aquemini is a great follow up to ATLiens and is the key success that Outkast with these three albums that Outkast is one of the greatest in the hip hop world.    Here is how I rated the album. I rate on three different things (Lyrics content, How good the beat is, And how good the flow of the rappers is with the beat). I take all the scores and find the average then take the total from all 15 songs and find the final rating.    1. You May Die (Intro)- A piano for the beat while a women sings a funky melody and sets the mood for the entire album.  Lyrics: --   Music: --   Flow: --    2. Two Dope Boyz (In A Cadillac)- A very short song (lasting about 2:45) to truly begin the album. This is just a classic song to roll your windows down to and drive down the street. Dre's first verse comes hard and also a great chorus by Dre.  Lyrics: 9.5/10    Music: 10/10    Flow: 10/10  Total=9.8/10    3. ATLiens- My favorite song on the album and one of my all time favorite songs. Big Boi's first verse is the best ever in my opinion with crafty word play (Well it's the M-I crooked letter, aint no one better and when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater cause im cooler than a polar bear's toe nail.) And the coolest hook ever of course. (Now throw your hands in the air-er and waive em like u just don't care-er. And if you like fish and gritz everybody say Oh yeah-er)  Lyrics-10/10   Music= 10/10    Flow=10/10  Total score=10/10      4. Wheelz Of Steel- Crazy song. My second favorite and second best on the album with the greatest minute of scratching you will EVER here. The verses are short but sweet. The set up is perfect (Dre giving the shout out's atthe end before the scratching begins) And a whicked beat.  Lyrics=10/10   Music=10/10     Flow=10/10  Total score=10/10      5. Jazzy Belle- One of the first story telling songs of Outkast (Aquemini full of them). Story about a . . . named Jazzy Belle. This song is the first change in the album. Before all the songs were quick paced and \\"hardcore\\" this song has a lighter slower beat. And a heavenly chorus sang by women just humming \\"la la la\\". Good scratching too    Lyrics= 10/10     Music=10/10   Flow=10/10  Total Score=10/10    6. Elevators (Me & You)- Another slow song but not quite as soft as Jazzy Belle. Outkast sings the hook themself here (Me and You, Your mama and your cousin too, rolling down the strip on fours, coming up slammin cadilac doors) haha great hook. The beat could've used work though, I don't think it goes good with their flow. The beat is good but would've been better with a different song. Good . . .  wordplay though.  Lyrics=10/10    Music=8/10     Flow=9/10  Total=9/10      7. Ova Da Wudz- \\"Something's gotta give\\"- First words of the song then the beat lays in. Crazy beat is in, every 8 seconds or so you hear a voice in the back \\"ummmmmm\\". Really plays with your mind. Good hook and pretty good wordplay. Big Bwoy is awesome.   Lyrics=9/10    Music=9/10     Flow=10/10   Total=9.3/10       8. Babylon- Dre is very good on the track with some good lines (\\" I came into this world high as a bird from second hand cocane\\") And a good hook and light soft beat. Another smoootth track.  Lyrics=10/10   Music=10/10    Flow=9.5/10   Total=9.8/10         9. Wailin'- Kick . . .  kick . . . kick . . . kick . . . beat. Would've loved the song more with a hook. With a crazy beat like this they could've made an awesome hook. Outkast shines again.  Lyrics=10/10    Music=10/10    Flow=10/10  Total=10/10          10. Mainstream- Song begins with a splash. Then about 15 seconds into the song the beat comes in. This is the third best song on the album. The beat is alight quick paced beat. Good hook (\\"Think is it but it aint all peaches and cream. That's why I sing this song floating face down in the main stream\\") Dre and Big Boi are the best on this track but the guest appearances verses are alright.  Lyrics= 10/10      Music= 10/10     Flow=10/10  Total=10/10        11. Decatur Psalm- One of my favorites and one of the most creative songs ever. Good beat and better lyrics and a classic hook (\\" It won't be over till the Big girl from Decatur sing\\") haha I love this song.  Lyrics=10/10    Music=10/10     Flow= 10/10                12. Millennium- Dre just rips this track apart. Probably his best verse ever in my opinion (his first) and a creative hook that you would never expect. Dre just goes off for 25 seconds of so with (\\" uh uh uh uh uhu huh uhuh uhu uh uhuh uhu\\") While a little girl repeats \\"Planet stars--- Earth, Jupiter, Mars--Hoes, clothes, car-- It's who you are.   Lyrics=10/10     Music=10/10    Flow=10/10 (One of the best)     Total=10/10    13. E.T. (Extraterrestrial)- Just a crazy . . . song. The lyrics are awesome. I'm not sure about the beat though.. at one point I'm thinking they can do better but at another I'm thinking how creative and soothing it is. I don't know.. buy the album and be the judge.  Lyrics=10/10     Music=8/10    Flow=9/10  Total=9/10      14. 13th Floor/Growing Old- First minute 30 is just a piano with someone talking. Then a sick slow whicked fascinating beat cuts in. One of the best tracks on the album.  Lyrics=10/10    Music=10/10    Flow=9/10  Total= 9.6/10          15. Elevators (ONP 86 Mix)- A remix of Elevators me and you. With a better beat.  Lyrics=10/10    Music=9.5/10   Flow=9/10  Total= 9.5/10    Total Score For ATLiens= 9.7/10  Nearly Flawless    If you don't find this review helpful.. you're just a hater
B0000DD7LB|2.0|OK, I don't hate Britney, so to all the Britney fans, don't say that I do. But the only song I really think is good is Me Against the Music. No other song sounded good, well yea in the beginning it does but after listening to it, I can honestly say I wasted my money....don't waste yours.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Before I start, I do have to say I miss the some of the chatter between songs as well as the guiter work on the original 'Let it Be'. Having said that, I never liked Phil Spector's way of record producing. I always thought it was gimicky, over the top and not up to par with George Martin's style. <br />This album, on the other hand, shows the music the way it should be; up front and without fluff. I gotta believe if George and John were around today, they would have approved. In the past, all Beatle albums were produced so well, with the exception of 'Let it Be'. Now they got it right. I also liked how the version of 'Don't Let Me Down' was added to the mix. I am so glad the didn't let this album 'let it be'.
B00005QENZ|4.0|A very uneven cd, luckly there are more good songs than bad. When it works, it rocks as good as any Aerosmith cd, and when it flops, it sucks big time.  FLESH, WALK ON DOWN, SHUT UP AND DANCE, GOTTA HAVE IT, &amp; LINE UP, are bad, beyound bad.  They cross over the line, trying too many things at once. The production is too brassy.  And when Steven ain't singing, it ain't Aerosmith.  Rest of the songs, are top notch, at times catching the magic, of years gone by, before and after the drug days.  Steven is a good rapper, with very unsmooth voice, that times sounds like he will not be able to whisper another word, much less sing or yell it, but it works.  INTRO, the uhh, intro for EAT THE RICH, is on the best preludes to a song in ages, just too short.  But is a good veiw of what is to come on this cd, a wild ride, with some surprises.  GET A GRIP is another good song, with a good beat taylor made for the voice of Aero.  CYING, CRAZY, &amp; AMAZING , you have heard them on the radio, seems like they played forever, and they belong still on the airwaves.  LIVIN' ON THE EDGE, another good song about mother earth, and how made we treat her.  All the good songs can be found on the hits collection BIG ONES, so I would suggest skipping this cd and buying that one.  Prodution on this cd is not as heavy as PUMP, but not as light weight as PERMENANT VACATION. Sounds As though they were trying to get the &quot;grunge&quot; feel of the day, which may have been what hurt a lot of the songs on this cd.  If you got to have all the Aerosmith cds for a collection, get it, BIG ONES, is still a better deal.
B00000JPYD|5.0|I am a huge Amazon customer but have never lent my 2 cents to any review..... I am here to say that Trower is amazing.... Bridge of Sighs is the most awesome... of course I was a child of the 70s but I recently played this for a couple who were just turning 30... they of course had never heard of this (i almost said album) and were awestruck... if you've never been moved before, this music is bound to do the trick!  Every single song rocks and moves one's body and soul to another level!
B00005QEO1|5.0|This is my favorite cd of theirs.  Even all the way thru. No dead wood or filler on this one.  The production at times seems a little heavy handed, but that's the feel thru out this cd, is that it rocks, even on the power ballads.  The group has always sung about women and rock, but this time they have shown a more mature side to their lyrics, with songs like MEDICINE MAN (about not taking care of earth, etc),&amp; JAMIE'S GOT A GUN (child abuse).  A great cd, worth buying.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Thanks to Neil Young i belive i have! simply brilliant!
B000002LND|4.0|I generally avoid pop music at all costs, however for Madonna's music I will make an exception. Even though nowadays I think she should long since retire and give it up, I actually enjoy her music from the '80s. I would never be caught with a Madonna CD, it's one of those CDs that you would play discretly. Yeah, I know the dance beats and some of the lyrics are corny but it's so bad you gotta love it. My favorite song is 'Like A Prayer' because it's a song that actually shows some depth. I love the opening line: \\"Life is a mystery/everyone must stand alone\\". However I realized that a lot of the songs aren't the originals, and this terribly disappointed me. What a complete ripoff!! If you can get beyond that however, you will actually enjoy the CD itself.
B000055Y0X|5.0|5 Stars aren't enough for this film.  It is the first DVD I ever bought and rightly so as it is, if not the best comedy movie of all time, certainly one of the top two.  It very accurately captures the near-paranoia of the cold war in the early sixties.  Peter Sellers never did a better job of acting multiple rolls in any other movie. The supporting cast did very well by themselves as well.  Yeah, Slim Pickens performed convincingly as a B-52 pilot to his credit. This movie was shot in black and white and wouldn't have had nearly the impact if it had been shot in color. If you haven't seen this movie, buy it and see it.  See it many times over.  It is a first rate flick on all counts.
0385504209|4.0|Great book, very provocative. It held my interest from begginig to end.
0385504209|5.0|It's important to remember that this is &quot;fiction&quot; and isn't supposed to be a historical research paper on Christianity and Christ.  It's fiction.  It's a very good read.  It's supposed to be and is a fun book.  If you are looking for historical reference material...go to the Vatican website.<br />The ending could have been better...but I still give the book 5 stars for entertainment value.  I enjoyed it very much.  It would make a good movie.
B00008J4P5|1.0|do not buy this album. besides the hype, this band does nothing but take up space. They are not special, the record is not that good. Actually it's kind of repetitive. and the fact that SPIN magazine said this was the top cd of 2003, i think i better go change my underwear then throw up. better music out there, for your better money...
B00009TB5G|5.0|Wow.. barely ever do you see an extended version of a movie and have it actually be way BETTER than the theatrical version!  The Two Towers does it seamlessly, and does it well!  The additional scenes looked like they should be there and I wish most had been there in the theatrical version - I don't think I can watch the shorter version again.  The extended version is that much better!<br />I have not read the books (blasphemy, I know!), so I felt like the additional scenes really made the movie come together more, and explained to me why certain characters act the way they do.  One particular scene is where Aragorn sets the horse free in the stable, then that same horse later comes to save him.  In the theatrical version, I was left wondering why this random horse saved his life - the extended version answered that question for me.  There are many other added scenes, including more with the Ents/Merry/Pippin, some more with Arwen and her father, more of Faramir and a great scene where Eomer finds Theoden's dying son after a battle with orcs.<br />I haven't gotten a chance to view many of the extras on the DVD set yet, but what I have seen so far is excellent!  My favorite extra so far is the stuff with Gollum and Andy Serkis - which I find fascinating!  Plus, there is a cute Gollum 'easter egg' which I'll not reveal here - but it's worth checking out.  I also listened to a bit of the director's commentary, and can't wait to hear the entire thing.<br />This set is great, well worth the cost.  So far, between the Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers, Peter Jackson is on his way to making one of the best trilogies of all time (in my humble opinion, of course).
0395389496|5.0|The Polar Express captures the innocence, charm and magic of childhood.  The story is about two siblings that climb aboard \\"the Polar Express\\" that takes them to the North Pole at Christmas time. There they meet Santa, see the sleigh and reindeer, and receive a special gift.<br />The drawings are almost Victorian in form and are incredibly detailed, which adds to the power and magic of the book.  It would make a wonderful Christmas gift for a child, and is a joy to read as an adult.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I never read the Laura Hillebrand book by the same name, but I did see the Seabiscuit movie and let me tell you - it was phenominal!  I know some say it was cliche - but the story is TRUE!  It's not just some Hollywood writer trying to come up with the latest feel good animal movie, it's actually true.<br />The acting was amazing in the movie.  Tobey Macguire did a great job as alcholic jockey Red Pollard, and Chris Cooper was outstanding as the horse-whisperer-like trainer Tom Smith.  Jeff Bridges (who is not one of my favorite actors) did a decent job in his role as well.  One of the funniest characters was William H. Macy's announcer during the races, he cracked me up!  Another surprisingly good performance was real life pro jockey Gary Stevens playing Red Pollard's friend and rival, jockey George Woolf.<br />The story is wonderful, taking place during the 1930's when the country is reeling from the Great Depression.  Jeff Bridges character, Charles Howard, is a business man whose wife leaves him after their child is killed.  He suffers from depression and ends up at a horse track where he meets a new girl and ends up buying the unruly Seabiscuit.  He meets up with outcast horse trainer Tom Smith and the unpredictable Red Pollard and the three of them take America by storm with the amazing Seabiscuit.<br />The film is beautifully done.  The locations are gorgeous and the race scenes are phenominal.  Seabiscuit is a hero and an inspiration in his own right, not only because he won races - but also because he gave hope to so many people at a time when they really needed it.
B00009TB5G|4.0|It's true that this is not as close an adaptation as The Fellowship of the Ring was.  But it's still a superb movie, and  better than I ever expected.<br />Peter Jackson and company have done beautifully. I honestly cannot understand the opinion of those who feel that the films have somehow been dumbed down from the books, or lost their spirit.  Tolkien's writing has been part of my life since my father read me The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings as a child and I feel no loss in their translation.  Tolkien's rich cultures, his profound love of nature, his hope in the face of greed and war are all here.  If they are not as detailed that is because film, being visual, is not as subtle a medium as writing.  For those who object to the scenes appearing in the movie that did not appear in the body the book: realize that many of these scenes, such as those between Arwen and Aragorn, are based on material from the LOTR appendices.  As for those that are not - such as the warg battle - perhaps they don't improve on Tolkien's story, but what do they detract from it?  Leave off the pompous moaning and enjoy the movies on their own terms.
B00005JMFR|2.0|While visually all three Matrix movies were stunning - the story was severely lacking.  In all honesty, I think they should have done the first movie and left it alone after that.  The first movie was amazingly good, fun action sequences, intriguing storyline, great characters.. but the second and third just don't compare.<br />The action scenes in both the second and third movie were amazing, but most of them did nothing to further the storyline.  The plot seemed juvenile and at times was boring.  Characters were introduced that really did nothing for the storyline (ie: the train man) and the last movie especially focused far too much on secondary characters.<br />I saw the Matrix Reloaded and I didn't hate it, but it didn't impress me like the first one did.  But after seeing Revolutions.. I was disappointed and angry.  The ending made no sense to me, the film spent too much time revolving around characters that I didn't care about.  I expected the third movie to be mostly about Neo, Trinity and Morphious.. which it didn't.<br />Overall...it was disappointing.  I still adore the first movie and I plan to watch it and just pretend the last two didn't even happen.
014028009X|1.0|I just can't understand the hype about this book.  This tedious, shallow-minded excuse for a heroine bumbles her way through an entire year, learning nothing and changing little.  <br />On and on she moans, mostly about not being in a permanent relationship, with endless reflection about couple and 'singletons'.  And why is she single, we might ask?  It's because she's a child.  <br />The book is very much in the manner of the Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, aged 14.  A common device used in both books is the accumulation of facts and circumstances, all pointing to an obvious conclusion which the reader can see but the main character cannot until late in the day (we all know, long before Adrian works it out, that his sister has been fathered by a man who is not his mother's husband;  we can see the signs that Bridget's mother's boyfriend is a crook long before she can).  But while this touching naivety is amusing for a 14 year old, it wears pretty thin for someone in her 30s.<br />So when we hear her, near the end of the book, talking about going 'home' for Christmas - meaning the place where her parents live - it's no surprise.  She bemoans that she isn't treated as an adult, she can't have an adult relationship; it's because she's never grown up or even tried to.  She still thinks of herself living with Mummy and Daddy, even though she might sleep over in her London flat (which they probably pay for) from time to time.  Emotionally, she's 14.<br />So, Bridget, I'm not surprised you're a 'singleton', and I don't think the relationship you've stumbled into at the end of the book will last long.  Stop wallowing in your childhood and grow up.<br />If you're still reading this book and wondering whether to press on to the end just to see what happens, don't bother.  It's not worth it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I read all the reviews on this;  and just a very big<BR>Thank You to all for the great input. <BR>I went out and bought it this am. <BR>WOW! an absolutely incredible dvd; even better<BR>than I thought it would be. <BR>Rhonda
0345452577|1.0|I am a huge Kellerman fan; own all of his books and love them all including Billy Straight and The Butcher's theater; both non-Delaware books. This one is just plain a miss. The characters never strike a note, the book is made up of 50 some chapters often 1 or 2 pages long, seemingly inflating a short story to a 280 page novel; a trend I think started by Mr. Patterson, and one I despise. 25 bucks for a 280 page book that is actually about 220? And the ending; I for one hate books that introduce the murderer 4/5'ths of the way thru. Pass this one; if you don't have all of the other Kellerman books, treat yourself and pick up one or two that are already published.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I saw this film first some 15 years ago - and I laid hands on the DVD version recently. While yes - the extras were great, and I discovered the soup song for the first time, what thrilled me most was the film itself. I was pretty surprised to see some complaints over the animation - for to me, this is the most perfect of all Disney animations. I find the more modern films like &quot;Beauty &amp; the beast&quot; to render the feature corners a little too sharp. The dwarfs are perhaps the most enjoyable part of the whole film with Dopey an obvious favorite. And Snowwhite is my favorite princess too !! And like the icing on the cake, we have the superb music - perhaps the best of all Disney soundtracks. While every song is a delight, my greatest favorite is &quot;With a smile and a song&quot;. Simplicity of words and tune create the most magical of melodies. A joy forever...
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I must say that I have this directors cut on VHS, but I am sure the quality is better on DVD. I saw Pink Floyd's Dark Side tour in 1973 and they performed all of the songs included here, except the take off on Seamus with the dog ( it is a treat). To me, this documents Pink Floyd's moment of ascension into their musical glory. I actually saw this underrated film on PBS back in 1975! The editorial reviewer hit the nail on the head with his cultural discription- completely in synch with seeing themself as \\"Relics\\" from the 1967 scene in London and San Francsico and wanted to break free of that stigma. A fate which the band managed to cheat!      Truely, what is astounding to me is just what exceptional musicains these guys are! As when I saw them live, I was astounded that they could put on such an effective live show without studio manipulation. This movie also shows us this. The playing is what it is about. The dress is dated but WHO CARES! People are dressing that way again (gag)! Ignore the cheese and really HEAR the music! Excellent, EXCELLENT film!
B00003CX8Y|3.0|Another classic from the Disney stables. But I would not call this Disney's best ! For me, a Disney film is not meant to be just a &quot;film&quot; - rather an experience. While the animation is almost as good as ever (though the faces are a little too sharp), I think Disney just tried to make a &quot;film&quot; here. At the end of it, while I could applaud the slick animation and technology, I could not realize any sort of that &quot;bubbling happiness&quot; that I expect from Disney. The music is good (though nowhere near Snowwhite and Sleeping beauty). What I miss most is the lack of sufficient *characters*. For example, in Snowwhite, every animal was given a part - the tortoise, the squirrels, the rats, the birds, the deers, the fly etc. Here, the focus is only on the lead characters. <br />Anyway, it suffers only in comparison - overall a good watch.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Let's see where to begin.  Allright, Jaws was an instant classic.  It still scares home viewers today.<br />The Basic Plot:<BR>Chief Brody is in his first Summer in Amity, a small town by the beach.  But when a girl gets eaten by a shark in the first few minutes, things start to get a little creepy.  The shark keeps on attaking, and the people still go swimming.  The mayer wants the beaches open for &quot;summer dollars.&quot;  Then when his son is in shock from a near death experiance, Brody knows he has to go after the beast.<br />The Good Points:<br />You don't see the shark until the movie is half over which builds up the tension.<br />The Bad Points:<br />The uses of profanity.<br />The DVD's Good Points:<br />The Making of Jaws was so much more interesting than the<BR>Making of Jurassic Park.  The trailers show us what we would have seen in a preview when the movie was first out.<br />The DVD's Bad Points:<br />The Production Photographs are very interesting but if you don't skip to move on to the next picture it runs about 45 minutes.<br />Overall:<br />The best in the series.  A timeless classic by Steven Speilberg that will never be forgotten.
0783204914|5.0|Pacino plays a blind, ailing, cantankerous old crotchet, retired military Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade with simmering thoughts of ending it all. Wow, talk about a fantastic performance. Will you ever forget the dance floor scene where he asks the kid for some parameters, size of the dance floor, and then dips into a spectacular tango? Or the sports car scene and the cop who stops him? Or the whole movie, for that matter. But especially, especially, especially for the final speech in front of the prep school that was trying to expel his assistant, one of the school's students at a trumped up disciplinary hearing.
0345409671|2.0|This boring installment is a notch worse than &quot;Body Thief.&quot; The series is masterful as a trilogy. Don't ruin a good thing. Read only the first three: &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;Lestat&quot; and &quot;Queen.&quot;
6300216543|5.0|Fantastic film with Al Pacino in the title role playing Frank Serpico, a real-life NYPD detective whose integrity nearly cost him his life (by disgruntled co-workers) and definitely cost him his career. This movie made Pacino an icon during the 70s, and he's never slowed down since. The plot is that Serpico goes undercover to ferret out other cops who are on the take. <BR>When we first watched this film it was on TV, and about 15 minutes from the end we suffered a power outage - and we freaked out, ran outside, up and down the block, looking for a neighbor who maybe still had power. No such luck, of course: the whole area was blacked out. It was about 3 years later that we rented it in video and finally got to watch the rest of it. Well worth the weight, but talk about frustration!<BR>Don't miss it.

Change The World: 11/10 best song on here.. really cool meaning, catchy intro (fun to play, too). plus, as a sign of the energy in this song, i have a habit of cranking the volume after the bridge.. raelly cool chorus, amazingly written.. whats not to like? great way to end the cd!<BR>(extra track): an old guy saying something about heavy metal.. uh.. not even going to bother rating it
B00005JMFO|5.0|Love Actually is so infectious...everyone I know who has seen it wants to go back and back.  It moves quickly with several hilarious and some tender stories.

B0000DD7NL|2.0|First of all I respect Alicia's musical talents.  But this album has BAD! writing and production.  Its not consistent at ALL!<BR>It has a couple of tracks that are okay, but the rest is just wake.  She gets to personal with the male bashing and stuff.  This CD for WOMAN ONLY!  to emotional for me.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Recently Whitney Houston has recieved more attention for her personal life and turbulent marriage than for the release of her two latest CD's Just Whitney and the One Wish Holiday Album (which debuted at #58 ?!?!?!) I closed my eyes and put this CD in my CD player to grasp the emotion in her voice and the surrounding music without focusing on WHITNEY HOUSTON.  The first track THE FIRST NOEL is the albums best.  The vocals and simplicity of the production really make the beauty of the carol come through, but to the above average vocal listener . . . We notice that Whitney is struggling with her upper register (her higher full voice range) It's coming across throaty which for someone like Mary J Blige would add character and emotion to the voice.  Because we are so use to Whitney's crystal clear belting, its a little disheartning.  The next track . . . The Christmas Song is very nicely done . . . with a few grammatical errors (Everybody's mothers child is going to spy. . . .)The little drummer boy couldve have survived without her daughter but it is a nice thought anyway.  Cantique De Noel/ O Holy Night is very beautifully done however . . . when you hold it up to Mariah's 1994 and Celine's 1998 and Christina Aguilera's 2000 versions . . . its very flat.  Now thats not really fair since each of those vocalists were at the top of their vocal game (at those times respectavely)  The rest of the album is pretty standard Whitney Houston Christmas Carols two songs stand out I'll be home for christmas (she sings this over an electronic keyboard no other instruments and it sounds wonderful wonderful wonderful --- even though there is struggling to get up in her higher range)  O Come Emanuel is nicely done especially the last run/riff.  I am pissed they included two songs from the 1996 Preachers Wife soundtrack because that made it in total only 9 new songs recorded for the album.  Overall even though i seem overly critical in the review this is a Good Chrsitmas Album . . . wejust expect Great work from Whitney Houston.
B000002JPA|5.0|This was a new sound for me back when it came out in 1993.  I mean, I like the heavy metal/rock type sound, but this defintely has an edge to it.  &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; sounds very metal/rock, yet &quot;Another Day&quot; is very melodic.  Now let me tell you, almost every song here is VERY lengthy and they do go on for quite a bit, but Dream Theater is an extremely talented band and I really like the sound.
B00004RYZT|5.0|YOU MUST SEE THIS PRODUCTION!!! Let me explain.  I'm nearly 51 years old, and have seen more stadium and arena concerts since 1970, than I can count.  My listening experiences have ranged from the San Francisco sound, to progressive/art rock, to fusion jazz, to bluegrass/finger-style guitar, with a little classical and symphony thrown in.  Let's not forget Trans-Siberian Orchestra.  I actually play classical guitar.  When I first heard Rammstein on the radio (Du Hast), I thought it was Megadeth singing in German.  When I saw the opening segment in the movie \\"XXX,\\" I couldn't believe it.  I decided I needed more \\"footage.\\" I ordered Live Aus Berlin on DVD, and can't quit watching it.  From the \\"space-men\\" intro, to the final note, it just totally blows me away.  My effort to categorize it fails, but images of Kiss, Devo, Ozzy, Kraftwerk, and Sparks all materialize, though nothing nails it.  It is way over-the-top.  What impresses me nearly as much as the performance is the audience.  My image of a Rammstein concert in the US would be attended by gothic, punk, or broom-headed mohawk types, which in total may fill a small theater.  When the \\"Live\\" camera view panned the stadium, revealing the huge Berlin audience, there were high-schoolers, working stiffs, war vets, real people, even over-50s like me.  This would be a Bruce Springsteen audience in the States.  What this tells me is that music like this is \\"mainstream\\" in Germany.  If this is indeed the case, about Germany and the music they embrace, then surely these are my people!  I'm really tempted to book a flight right now to see a live show... It's that good.

B00006CXXU|1.0|I will admit that im not the biggest fan of Christina, but I loved the song \\"Dirrty\\" which made me purchase this.  Anyway, this is very boring.  It drags on too long, you'll be half asleep by the time you get to the end.  I cannot believe that she has wasted a lot of precius time and talent into a bland and cleche album.<br />1. Intro- Unrated<br />2. Can't Hold Us Down feat. Lil Kim- Cool song. One C.A.'s never done before. Very unique. The lyrics are a little repetitive in some cases, but the song is an obviuos single. *Stand out track* 4.5/5<br />3. Walk Away- I think that this is one of the best ballads on the album. Its very laid back and haunting. Very cool, not a single however. 4/5<br />4. Fighter- My favorite of the tracks. This is another stand out track being the only rockish song on the album. Everything in the song falls into place very easily. 4.5/5<br />5. SKIT- NOT RATED<br />6. Infatuation- Cool beat. This song is one that will make you want to dance. I am a little fond of it, but, its not a single. 3.5/5<br />7. Loving Me For Me- SKIT- NOT RATED<br />8. Loving Me For Me- The lyrics spark intrest, but, the song is boring. I dont think you will like it. Its a \\"filler\\" track. 2/5<br />9. Impossible feat. Alishia Keys- Alright track. It is another stand out track, but, not a single. I think that this is a kind of music Christina shoul stay away from. Not that bad, Not that great. 3/5<br />10. Underappreciated- The only thing I can think of to describe this track is, stupid. Its so dumb that its mind filling. You wont like this track. Another album filler. 2.5/5<br />11. Beautiful- I used to like this track. It was cool, but it got old real quick. You will probably like it, for the first couple times around. Then, it gets old. 3.5/5<br />12. Make Over- This is an alright track. It barely stands out amongst the entire album. I like it, but, its not a single. You might like it if you like upbeat, rockish type tracks. 3/5<br />13. Cruz- This and Soar kindof blend in with each other. I wouldnt call this a single, and i wouldnt listen to it over and over again. Not too stunning. 3/5<br />14. Soar- I like this better than Cruz, but, still not to great. Its alright, but, again, not a single. 3.5/5<br />15- Get Mine Get Yours- I like this track. Its seducing, and it stands out amongst the upper album tracks. Its a good dance track. 4/5<br />16- Dirrty- I love this song, thats why I bought the album. You probably have heard it. I let you decide if you like it or not. 5/5<br />17- Stripped 2- SKIT- NOT RATED<br />18- The Voice Within- This isnt that bad of a track. Its lyrics are a little like Soar, but i like it. Its very laid back and mellow, and i love the middle part of the sing. 3.5/5<br />19- Im O.K.- This is a haunting song, and i think it will grab your attention, if you can make it this far through the album. The song is slow, chilling, and magnificent. I like the song. The lyric content is very strong as well.4/5<br />20- Singing My Song- Awful. I wish she would stop singing this song. Its what, 6 min. long, and its so boring it will put you to sleep. Not cool, very stupid, and not worth the time.<BR>1.5/5 <br />I hope that she comes out with something more defyning for her career next time.  Nice try, but too short of 5 stars.
0385504209|1.0|The overwhelming popularity of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is puzzling to many of us who care about good writing, and who have devoted a lifetime to the study of Judaism and Christianity.<br />First of all, Mr. Brown's writing is poor, even by popular mystery novel standards.<br />Second, the supposedly-remarkable discoveries concerning Jesus' life that are at the center of The Da Vinci Code are quite well known to people who have read beyond the New Testament for their religious history.<br />Perhaps the popularity of The Da Vinci Code stems from a newly-popular interest in developing a deeper understanding of all things Jewish, Christian and biblical. If this is the case--and I hope it is--I would strongly recommend that readers save their time and money, avoid reading The Da Vinci Code, and instead, read one or more of the following:<br />1. The Genius of Genesis by Dennis Shulman.<br />2. Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time by Marcus Borg.<br />3. Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Richard Leigh and others.

0767817478|3.0|After scoring a huge hit with ID4 everyone expected Roland Emmerich to really impress us with this movie. Godzilla had a lot to live up to. It disappointed on every level imaginable. The only way to enjoy this is as purely brain-dead nonsense. Think about it and you'll realize how bad it is. So seriously, switch your brain off.<br />The problems mainly lie with the fact that Godzilla himself is very unremarkable. He's just a giant lizard. Hardly threatening. And like Matthew Broderick's character says, he's not evil-he just wants food. It's hard to consider him a baddie when all he does is accidentally trash New York. Plus he moves and looks too much like the Jurassic Park T-Rex to be particularly impressive.<br />None of the characters are interesting either. Which makes the 'character building' scenes completely useless. That time could have been put to much better use in this 140 minute long film. Only Jean Reno comes away with his dignity intact (can you believe he turned down playing Agent Smith to be in this?). Though it is cool to see Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria (Principal Skinner/Kent Brockman and Moe/Apu) in a movie together but they don't get much screen time.<br />In comparison to ID4, Emmerich's direction kind of falls flat. Remember the public reactions as huge spaceships descended upon New York and LA and how everyone kind of watched in hypnotical awe as panic arose around them. The same could have been used in Godzilla but far too much of the movie has New Yorkers acting completely indifferently to a 1000 foot reptile hopping through the city. And I know those Apache helicopter scenes featuring the 'miniature' buildings are supposed to be an homage to the Japanese Godzilla flicks but here they look completely stupid and seem like they belong in a different movie. They just don't fit in with the rest of the film and it's very distracting. That could have been handled a lot better.<br />The ending sets up story for two sequels which never happened because of massive audience disappointment. A shame kind of since Emmerich could have learned from his mistakes in this movie and made a sequel that is much better.<br />I own the Superbit DVD of Godzilla (only available in Region 2 at the moment) and the DTS 5.1 sound is awesome. With every pounding footstep of the big lizard the living room booms and shakes. Plus the 2.40:1 anamorphic picture is flawless.cause of massive audience disappointment.

078681859X|4.0|I know it's unoriginal to compare children's fantasy to Harry Potter. But when said young wizard is the standard practically all authors in the genre have to live up to it's hard to avoid comparison. The Amulet of Samarkand is the first book in the 'Bartimaeus' trilogy and it's definitely more sophisticated than Harry Potter or Artemis Fowl.<br />The story is of a 12 year old boy called Nathaniel who is adopted by a sour, strict magician at the age of five to train as magician himself. In this world the Houses of Parliament is full of magicians and they run the country using their own reckless methods, much to the distain of the commoners (Muggles in the Harry Potter world). As a way of getting revenge on his cruel master, Nathaniel summons a cynical, sarcastic djinni called Bartimaeus to steal an apparently ordinary amulet (of Samarkand) from his master's colleague's house to frame him.<br />But the Amulet of Samarkand is a very special artefact indeed and is the centrepiece of a sinister plot hatched by evil magician Simon Lovelace. Of course Nathaniel realizes this all too late as he's soon in the middle of Lovelace's evil plan. Though he does have Bartimaeus under 'verbal contract' and with the help of this disgruntled djinni he attempts to foil Lovelace.<br />The story is told from two narrators. Nathaniel's part is typical 3rd person perspective and Bartimaeus is first person. The book regularly switches between them after every three or so chapters. There's a lot of pathos to be had in Nathaniel's side of the story and he's definitely a stronger character than Harry Potter or Artemis Fowl and Bartimaeus's version of events are always interesting especially with his often amusing footnotes at the bottom of every page.<br />Stroud's world seems much more probable than JK Rowling's too. The word wizard is only mentioned twice in this book (tho it would have made more literal sense to have not been mentioned at all) and no one uses wands (magic is either done with the hands on inside pentacles with incantations instead of spells). Plus Stroud seems to stick to ancient middle-eastern mythology as his source of inspiration rather than just make up silly sounding words to add a bit of light humor (the Harry Potter books are extremely guilty of this). His cold London winter setting and slightly oppressive tone make this harder than normal children's fantasy and (for a first novel in a series) it's a highly detailed world to be immersed in. Giving the impression that Stroud thought about all this beforehand and it's not something he'll develop as he thinks about it over the course of three books.<br />The Amulet of Samarkand is a long book. And takes some time to get thru. I was a little put off by the middle of the book, which sagged somewhat. For this reason I cannot give the book 5/5. But it's still the most superior and intelligent children's fantasy I've read. I eagerly await 2 and 3. My copy is signed by the author.ith the hands on inside pentacles with incantations instead of spells).

We have been to Gettysburg, Pa and walked the battlefield, and you can almost see what happened and hear them talking to you.  It gave credit to those that fought and fell on both sides, and did justice to the truth of what happened.  This is a movie that is part of our American history.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I am hoping to get it on DVD when it comes out.
038572179X|5.0|This book is divided into three parts, the first of which has quite a different style--much slower with more stream of consciousness (but not too much).  However, the book as a whole is cohesive.  As the main character suggests about her own writing, the first part of the book (which some describe as plodding) owes much to Virginia Woolf's style, but not so much that the reader has a difficult time figuring out what is going on.  I think the first part of the book is the manuscript that Briony submits to a publisher around the time she begins nursing.  Thus, while the style is somewhat confusing, it helps us to understand the characters more--Briony herself, and also those around her who form the tragic events of the novel.  Perhaps I am mistaken!  The &quot;twist&quot; at the end was truly beautiful and tragic, without being &quot;cute&quot; (like the ending of Amsterdam).  I highly recommend this book for plot, style, and innovation on the form of the novel itself.

B00005JKG9|4.0|Anyone who has not yet seen a David Mamet film needs to do themselves a favor and get a hold of this one.  Mamet transferred his play into this film version and put together an incredible cast to play the salesmen.  How good is the cast when Alan Arkin is basically overshadowed both by the names on the list and the characters on the screen?<br />Times are tough at Premiere Properties.  Sales are down for all except Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), who is on a streak.  The others have to endure a &quot;sales conference&quot; at the beginning of the film from corporate heavy Blake (Alec Baldwin) where he basically challenges their manhood and insults them in one of the funniest seven minute monologues in movie history.  Basically, if they don't meet their quotas, they will be canned.  Some of the veterans like Shelley &quot;the machine&quot; Levene (Jack Lemmon), George (Arkin) and Dave Moss (Ed Harris) then try to pick up from there and go sell this garbage real estate to the &quot;deadbeats&quot; the office manager, Williamson (Kevin Spacey) has given them as leads.<br />The big problem is that there are new leads which are apparantly very promising, the Glengarry leads, but Baldwin and Spacey make it clear that they will only go to &quot;closers&quot;, people who can get customers to sign on the dotted line.  If you are not doing well, you don't get the best names.  This presents a paradox.  If you can't get legitimate customer prospects, how will you ever get out of the hole?  Somewhere in the movie a crime is committed which changes the premise of the film for the second half, and the characters all have to respond to the new situation put upon them.<br />What makes this a remarkable film is the dialogue.  It's not for kids- this film features more swearing than most movies you will watch, but the actors really get into the lines they are given and are all enjoyable, except Arkin, who looks like someone who has had one too many labotomies.  Lemmon is fantastic, as is Pacino.  Harris is a sniveling crybaby and Spacey does a great job as an office manager who really does not know how to do the job he has been given.<br />The DVD is good.  Not great, but good.  The DTS track is clear, as is the transfer.  The first half of the movie is on a dark rainy night, which can be a problem visually, but the film handles it beautifully.  The bonus features are ok, but I would have liked to hear Lemmon's commentary which was on the laserdisc.  The other features are interesting, but nothing extremely special.<br />I recommend this film.  It is another example of why movies are good.  They are not good for the computer graphics, or the explosions, or action.  Movies are good because of good characters.  That's the way it has always been.  This film will give you great actors playing great characters.  That's all you need.
B000002TP7|1.0|It's pretty simple - if you think this is a good album then you don't know much about music.  If you think this is good hip hop then you are just stupid.<br />This album is a dreadful combination of overdone production effects, retarded lyrics, and unbearably simple political messages.  The Beastie Boys bludgeon the listener with messages about the burning of the rainforests and the wrongness of violence throughtout the album, giving it the feel of a public service announcement.<br />There are a few highlights on this album - &quot;Sure Shot&quot; and &quot;Flute Loop&quot; both of which rely heavily on a piece of music that the Beastie Boys did not write.  Of course sampling is an art in it's own right, my point is simply that to think of the B Boys as actual musicians in their own right is laughable.  Their attempts at original composition on this album are dreadful and could only be percieved favorably by fans, most of whom are probably morons who would tell you that 311 have meaningful lyrics.  Lastly, the BBoys can't seem to get away from the distorted voice effect on this album, they use the same effect on virtually every track - it gets old and seems lazy.  Even the guest appearance by QTip on this album seems lazy and uninspired.<br />If the Beastie Boys claims on this album are to be believed, they've stopped smoking weed and have &quot;grown up&quot;.  Obviously the music has suffered from their sobriety.  Fortunately their next album &quot;Hello Nasty&quot; is much better than this one.
B00003RQNJ|4.0|Butch and Sundance (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) are two affable outlaws who bear no malice toward anyone although they make their living by robbing trains and banks.  They enjoy their freedom and their easy-going camaraderie until they make the mistake of stealing from the wrong man, a powerful millionaire who sets a skilled, relentless group of hired killers on their trail.  From then on, death is always in the background, implacable and ever-present.  They may escape for a time, but the end is unavoidable./    Newman and Redford have great chemistry.  Their timing and the way they play off each other is the main delight of this film.  This movie helped redefine the modern Western and issued in a slew of buddy pictures.  Watch it to see two Hollywood legends at their finest in a hugely entertaining film.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I first saw this movie on Pay Per View recommended by someone I met at the doctors office.  She seemed really passionate about liking this movie. So, my daughters and I bought the movie and fell in love.  It is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  The actress that plays the little girl in the movie should have won an Oscar for her portrayal. She was so believable that you almost wonder if the story is true and that you were just watching a documentary about her life.  I am going to buy this and watch it over and over.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Ok, this isn't a review, but a venting.  I just checked on 4 series that I've started collecting (Six Feet Under, All in the Family, Mary Tyler Moore and Twin Peaks). Now they are all on hold or canceled or whatever. They get me started on these shows and then STOP releasing them!  I'm sick of it, I think they are hurting their sales in the long run due to frustrated customers and eventual dwindling interest.  Oh yeah, Six Feet Under is original, quite unique and awesome.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is by far the greatest album ever constructed. Those of you that have never experienced a &quot;toolgasm&quot; be prepared.  Aenima is without a doubt Tools greatest work. Highly recommended for all music lovers. Even if you're not a heavy metal listener this CD will grow on you.
6305364648|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite Schwarzenegger movies. I have spoken to many friends who all liked this movie. The action is incredible. The cast is very talented. It has incredible tension - keeping you at the edge of your seat. Finally, it has excellent special effects.
0385504209|1.0|This is a drawn out, poorly written piece of fiction portraying a plethora of pagan opinions as historical fact.  It's every<br />&quot;Woman's Book Club&quot; dream as the plot lures them in with references to the &quot;Sacred Feminine&quot;.  Written for a mass-market audience, it attempts to discredit not only the Catholic Church, but all Christians, and even Jews and Buddhists.  It mocks the very idea of &quot;Faith&quot; in anything, besides the ridiculous notion of a &quot;Sacred Feminine.&quot;  The author's interpretations of da Vinci's art are distorted and far-reaching as well.  Unfortunately, lay readers presumably cannot detect the misinformation and trust in Brown's pagan-inspired &quot;history lesson.&quot;  He even tries to persuade his readers that the Satanic Pentagram is a beautiful misunderstood symbol of femininity that should be respected.<br />Please spare yourself from this blasphemous piece of trash.  For, even if you are not offended by the notion that Christianity was simply a political trick of Constantine, the writing itself is didactic and boring.  Sadly, the book has remained a number one bestseller for months because Brown takes the reader down interesting intellectual paths (on which I assume the average reader has never ventured). This instantly excites the ignorant and unsuspecting reader lacking the educational background to see through his faulty logic.  So, while any person endowed with a shred of intelligence should not be spiritually affected by this book, at worst, its 449 pages will amount to a colossal waste of time.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made in Hollywood -- right up there with Casablanca.  The story is engaging, the action is suspenseful, and the ethical issues are thought-provoking.  In addition to a wonderful score, there is even a bit of English history available if one cares to absorb it.  <br />My children were mesmerized by this movie when they were younger, and I always enjoyed watching it with them, marvelling at the quality of the production, lamenting that current fare can't hold a candle to its quality.  I am so happy there is finally a DVD; our VHS is worn out.  The children are grown now, but this is still a family favorite, thus attesting to the movie's appeal to all ages.

0446530891|1.0|A page turner all right, but when done with the book, I wished I had my time back. Ending was contrived and grossly artificial. Made Da Vinci Code look even better by comparison. Save your money.
0156027321|1.0|Yes, people who cannot understand the meaning that is hidden in the book believe it is touching, wonderful, adventurous, miraculous, etc.<br />But, it essence it supports the captivity of animals through Zoos. It condones non-vegetarianism through desperation. It is not a book that supports non-vegetarianism for reasons of health or religious text -- it is pure barbarism.<br />And not only this, it is vividly descriptive of these vile acts.<br />Before we mix religions, and cloud ideologies, we must know that this book is a skewed opinion of reality. Email me at gjagannath@ucdavis.edu for more on my opinion of this.
B00005O3VC|2.0|Sounds like a fine mockumentary for the bored and useless.
B00005JLD4|3.0|I've read a large number of glowing reviews of this film - and I don't necessarily disagree - it's a very good movie - well structured, beautifully shot, etc.<br />But I'm going to be brave here and say the unspeakable - this is a boring flick.  No matter how heartfelt and important the content of this film is or how true and fully realized are the protagonist's epic journey, these young girls just _don't say anything_(!).  A good subtitle would have been &quot;Mimes Across the Desert&quot; (ha ha ha... heh)<br />These girls never come to life for me - they have no opinions about anything, no distinct personalities, no inner life.  The audience can empathize and project themselves into these runaways, so the film does work - but this film could have been so much more if only it had an additional 5-10 minutes of dialogue.<br />The commentary however, is very interesting and informative of the whole process. Mr. Noyce shares with us his irritation with Hollywood and takes a verbal stab at Harrison Ford.  Unintentionally funny stuff.
0671027344|5.0|'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is perhaps the most true-to-life novel that I have read about 'that difficult age'.  Charlie's experiences, in some ways, mirrored my own feelings of aloneness, insecurity, thinking, emotions, whatever.  In a way, I think we all can relate to Charlie in some way.  He is just a normal kid with extraordinary circumstances that we all have faced.  The book was painful and joyous at the same time.  It was not a 'look' at teen life or an 'expose', but a tribute or a celebration.  <br />(And Charlie didn't cry too much!  I remember crying A LOT through high school.  It was the center of the universe for four years, remember?  Everything was absolutely important, just like in Charlie's story.)
B0000DJZA5|1.0|&gt;Correction to one earlier review: The &quot;Hey Jude&quot; album was most definitely NOT a bootleg; it was a legitimate EMI/Capitol release that tried to put a bunch of stuff on an LP that had never been on LP before. A sloppy job, to be sure, but legit all the same. <br />Funny, as I remember, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was generally thought to be one of the four best Beatles albums, along with &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; (the American version, not the British version later released on CD-what you leave out is as important as what you put in) and, of course, Sgt. Pepper and &quot;Abby Road&quot;. <br />Vinyls aside, as the Past Masters liner notes point out, if you've got the thirteen and the two Past Masters, you've got the Beatles; it's over and done with; you're through; STOP already.<br />I understand your problem, though. It's Christmas, and the Beatles fanatic on your list has the thirteen and the two Past Masters. What to do? <br />Let's quote Rolling Stone magazine: &quot;Both Lennon and Harrison went on to work closely with Spector, who produced Plastic Ono Band, Imagine and All Things Must Pass -- arguably the three best albums of the Beatles' solo years&quot;. <br />Does he have these? Plastic Ono features one half of the Beatles, John Lennon AND Ringo Starr (on every cut!). &quot;Imagine&quot; features another one half of the Beatles, John Lennon AND George Harrison. For a third one half of the Beatles, how about the excellent &quot;Concert for Bangladesh&quot;, featuring George Harrison and Ringo Starr? As for the remaining one fourth of the Beatles, Paul McCartney's &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot; includes a very Beatle-like &quot;My Brave Face&quot; as well as the beautiful ballad &quot;Distractions&quot; (with a great arrangement by jazz pianist Claire Fisher).

0694524441|3.0|The Prologue from the book, The Alchemist...<BR>The Alchemist picked up a book that someone in <BR>the caravan had brought. Leafing through the pages, <BR>he found a story about Narcissus. <BR>The alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a youth <BR>who daily knelt beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty. <BR>He was so fascinated by himself that, one morning, he fell <BR>into the lake and drowned. At the spot where he fell, a flower <BR>was born, which was called the narcissus. <BR>But this was not how the author of the book ended the <BR>story. <BR>He said that when Narcissus died, the Goddesses of the <BR>Forest appeared and found the lake, which had been fresh <BR>water, transformed into a lake of salty tears. <BR>&quot;Why do you weep?&quot; the Goddesses asked. <BR>&quot;I weep for Narcissus,&quot; the lake replied. <BR>&quot;Ah, it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus,&quot; they <BR>said, &quot;for though we always pursued him in the forest, you <BR>alone could contemplate his beauty close at hand.&quot; <BR>&quot;But..... was Narcissus beautiful?&quot; the lake asked. <BR>&quot;Who better than you to know that?&quot; the Goddesses said <BR>in wonder, &quot;After all, it was by your banks that he knelt each <BR>day to contemplate himself!!&quot; <BR>The lake was silent for some time. <BR>Finally it said: <BR>&quot;I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus <BR>was beautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my <BR>banks, I could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty <BR>reflected.&quot;<BR>&quot;What a lovely story,&quot; the alchemist thought.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a very romantic story about Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy and the pride and prejudices of the various characters in the novel.<br /> My favorite chapter is nineteen of volume three because everyone is happy.  Elizabeth is married to Darcy and Jane is married  to Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet is happy because three of her daughters are married.<br /> Pride and Prejudice is appropriate for people 15 years and older because it is interesting  and romantic. I would really recommend them to read the novel because they would really like the novel.<br /> One literary device that I appreciate was how Jane Austen uses the letters in the novel to advance the plot in the story. For example the letter from Darcy to Elizabeth told the reader that they might get married because now Elizabeth would know that Wickham was a liar. The way that she did that was when Darcy wrote to Elizabeth to tell her that Wickham was not saying the truth about him and that Wickham was a liar . Another example would be when Jane wrote to Elizabeth to tell her that Lydia had run away with Wickham. Lydia has to marry Wichham so that it wouldn't be a disgrace for the family.<br /> I like the novel because it makes us think about pride and prejudice against others, and about knowing people before we judge them.  This novel is also very romantic for people who like romantic novels. I would recommend everyone to read it.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|If you missed the first outing of the Strokes, then thats what you should be taking a look at first- &quot;Is This It&quot; from 2001, the album and band that have instilled a sense of optimism in the rock-loving folk of the nation. Alongwith other current bands like White Stripes, The Strokes are a welcome change from the ocean of Hip Hop and its off-shoots. While &quot;Is This It&quot; demonstrated that The Strokes had the magic, &quot;Room on Fire&quot; confirms that it wasn't a fluke- they have something special.<br />For fans of &quot;Is This It&quot;, there is no excuse for reading this review- if you like that one, you'll love this. For those not well versed with the ways of The Strokes- go see them live; its a treat. This album (as did its predecessor) pulls influences from 70s rockers like Velvet Undergroud and others as varied as The Beatles; to form a unique sound of their own. Start to finish- its a winner.

B00005K3LU|5.0|Die Hard is an action packed thrill ride from director John Mctiernan(director of Predator,Rollerball,Basic, and Die Hard with a Vengeance).  The film is about a New York cop named John Mclane who flies to L.A to visit his wife Holly at the Nakotomi plaza where she has a great job.  John arrives at the skyscraper and proceeds to the 30th floor where a christmas party is going on.  He meets Nakatomi(Holly's boss) and discuss his business profits.  John argues with Holly over the use of her maiden name and then she walks out of the office.  The next thing our hero knows is that Hans Gruber(a very menacing Alan Rickman)is shooting up the place.  He takes everyone hostage except John, who escapes and then plays a cat and mouse game with his enemies,  Terrorists with HUGE artillery that the Los Angeles police can't even compete with.  Bruce Willis steals the show in his breakthrough role.  Great 80's movie

She really doesn't care what you think, she just wants you to have a merry christmas, using her music as an inspiration. Is that so hard? The tracks are hot and you will definitely keep this cd spinning at all your holiday events.

0380973650|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It is a tale of what exactly Gods are and that in fact they are not just some footnote in the history books. Its main plot concerns a Nordic Ragnarok-like showdown between the Gods of Old and the new Gods that most of don't realize we worship. However there are also many short stories of Gods from the many different lands and cultures that the North American society has attracted. I found these to be the most interesting and endearing. These stories makes the book into something special, like a collection of rich spiritual possibilities and has a very sweet ending.<br />I read some rather nasty reviews of this book which is unfortunate that they could not see the forest for the trees or simply enjoy it like I did. One complant was that the new Gods of Telivision and automobiles were not fleshed out, perhaps, but they are beings that we are all familar with and as to their desires they are made from the same essence as any other God and simply desire to be worshipped, loved and remembered. At least that what I got out of it.<br />As a Canadian it would cool to see a book like this on the people up here but then again I am very aware that Canadian and American culture despite what Molson ads proclaim, are VERY similar. Really the only significant difference is the huge province full of lovable frenchmen in Quebec (If you have not been to Quebec, GO!). I also read this book on a road trip of sorts of Canada from sea to sea and it was one hell of an experience. The book also touched me deeply on a spiritual level as I consider myself a Wiccan amongst other faiths so the excellent characterization of Odin and many other Gods I have always had a softr spot for was very well done.<br />I hope my review has made you consider delving into the rich mythological lore that is this book, if its narrative constructs are not original thaen so what? When have mythologies or Gods for that matter ever prided themselves on originality, its the journey and description that matter and the kinds of paints that used to paint the picture. American Gods is truly worthwhile.iption that matter and the kinds of paints that used to paint the picture. American Gods is truly worthwhile.
B00005JM4Z|1.0|This movie seemed like it took 2 days to write the script.  It begins with the star of the first film Brian O' Conner racing his Nissan Skyline to make some money.  I live in Downtown Miami and there could never be a race around downtown that fast without some driver running over a group of kids or seniors.  The police shoot Paul Walker's car with a ...looking gun and coerce him into going undercover to infiltrate a money launderer/soft gangster named Carter Verone(Cole Hauser).  Brian says he wants a partner, Roman Pearce played by Tyrese.  Why does there HAVE to be actors in movies just because they are somewhat good looking.  The Fast and the Furious was a great movie and this one pretty much erases all the credibilty and respect that the original had.  Paul Walker should have demanded creative control and made sure it did not end up ... LIKE IT DID.  The people that saw this movie in the theatres do not have a life and anyone who enjoyed it is on some kind of controlled substance or alcohol.
0802130208|2.0|I wish I knew how a posthumous book should be edited.  As a first novel (excluding the one Toole wrote as a child) it shows enormous creativity and imagination, but I schlepped through the second 200 pages hoping for a change of pace.  He showed  acute powers of observation -- I have known the group of not-so-smart bowling friends in Brooklyn, and I have worked at the long defunct Gloria Gloves in lower Manhattan, with the factory shut off from the office headed by the loyal office manager, the misfit clerk, and the owner impatient to get back to her hobby of show dogs, while the business decays from obsolescence and neglect. Burma Jones, the African-American sweeper working under threat of blackmail, is perhaps only drawn as broadly as the white characters, and he voices truths of life in the 60's, but he borders on a stereotype.  Minkoff, the radical bohemian, exists even today on college campuses and in Soho. Ignatius's character can probably be found in the DSM-IV under dependent borderline personality with delusions of grandeur. He is funny until he's not so funny.  The factor that keeps Ignatius from being Dickensian is that in Dickens's works the eccentric people who were funny had some basic worth, while the evil people were obviously evil.  But Ignatius is too destructive -- he is parasitic on his mother, he writes a slanderous letter over a forged signature, he wants to lead the factory workers to do physical harm to the office manager, he ruins a desperate stripper's opening night, and he always bites the hands that feed him.  Yet, I think Toole wants us to like him.  Shakespeare shows us that Falstaff is destructive by having the prince reject him in the end.  Ignatius's mother rejects him in the end, when he will stand in the way of her last chance for happiness, but the bohemian girlfriend accepts him, even as he is making her his chauffeur.  I would want Toole to save some of the many incidents for a next book.  I would also want him to have Ignatiusshow some growth, but he remains clueless all the way through, although the other characters grow.  I would say this is a good book to taste, but it's not a good meal.
B0000VV3UU|4.0|If you found this review, you're probably specifically looking for the Reality SACD.  It's fairly hard to find, because sony has done a poor job of issuing this release.  First of all, its a CD/SACD hybrid, so why they decided they needed to issue a regular cd version, a special edition version and a hybrid SACD version of this release is beyond me.  Secondly, the SACD release date was pushed back for so long that many people who might have bought the hybrid disc have already purchased one version or another.  This might explain why stores don't seem to be stocking the SACD version--they probably have more than enough unsold special editions sitting on their shelves.  Sorry for the rant, but sony's approach to sacd pisses me off: first they issue sacd only discs that won't play on a normal cd player, then when they finally realize how stupid that was and issue hybrid discs like this, they screw it up as well. <br />That said, this is a very good production from Bowie.  Nothing jaw-dropping (though Pablo Picasso might come as a shock to Modern Lovers fans), but not boring either.  Given that the album's music has more of a &quot;live&quot; sound, it's not surprising that the 5.1 mix is pretty straight forward.  There's a few songs where the drums and effects are spread out to the surrounds, but Bowie's voice mostly stays center.  Sounds good though.
0679311718|5.0|This book will have you reading into the night. You simply can't put this book down. The other thing you can't do, is understand the way the world acted - or rather did not act - in Rwanda. Dallaire's book is shocking and is probably going to make you question a lot of things about international politics. Dallaire is a tragic hero, a self described casulty of this genocide, and his book is a very important historical document. Don't miss the opportunity to read this, it is a life changer.

B00006LLNU|5.0|( ) is a darker, more brooding album than its predecessor Agaetus Byrjun, which, in what may be a deliberate irony, is very much the opposite of its brighter cover art.  I recommend it to anyone interested in Pink Floyd, Rick Wright, or Radiohead for their musical aspects.  There are even some classical overtones, despite their seeming to move past the full-orchestra approach for a more minimalistic one.  Don't be daunted by Sigur Ros' deliberate air of mystery--this is truly a worthwhile album.<br />This album has new emotions for Sigur Ros--sadness, even full-blown rage at the end of Track 8.  The first group of four songs is closer to the old Sigur Ros, more delicately beautiful, and while mournful at times, also uplifting.  Track 2/Track 3 are the perfect examples of this, especially Track 3, which is a pure instrumental (no singing at all), with a gorgeous piano sequence.  It's one part elegy, one part celebration.  For all its sadness, it slowly builds up an amazing amount of power, and even as it dies away, you can't help that remaining sense of lingering joy.  It is achingly bittersweet.<br />Over the second half of ( ), Sigur Ros moves into its new emotional territory.  Discord, heavy, brooding arrangements, and much more anguished, sometimes bitter vocals set this section apart.  I appreciate the Hammond organ, which becomes more prominent on the second half of the album.  Track 5 in particular shows them off well.  I am reminded in part of the way Rick Wright used the Hammond on Pink Floyd's classic &quot;Us and Them&quot;, and for that feature especially, I commend Track 5.<br />You have to be patient to listen to ( )--the songs build very gradually to a crescendo that does not always come.  Track 7 moves closer to bitterness--and then there is the explosion in Track 8.  At first it sounds like it will be a triumphant closing anthem and then--WHAM!  I've heard few better expressions of such blinding anger...it's actually stronger because it has no recognizeable words.  Rather than a momentary and someday laughable teenage-angsty outburst, this is an expression of pure emotion itself almost up there with Pink Floyd's &quot;One of These Days&quot; (which does have one distorted lyric, but is otherwise an instrumental).  That is why I can appreciate it so much as Sigur Ros explodes into rage with Jonsi's chilling voice hovering over the chaos.<br />The only weakness of this album, in comparison with Agaetus Byrjun is, as other reviewers have pointed out, that Jonsi seems far less creative with his made-up language than before.  However, this is still a spectacular album well worth its 5 stars!
0811729117|4.0|Okay, this one is a great read, full of technical details about the german panzer units and anecdoctes about the army and so one. This type of really mundane info is pretty hard to find, so it makes for a good read. Yet, the book suffers from the same flaw as a most other books written by germans verterans. Being: the constant and arrogant complaints about allied material superioty, i.e: germany was outproduced by the allies and so on. By the same logic, which apparently explains every battle lost by the germans, France would have never fallen since they had more tanks and soldiers than the germans, in 1940. So i guess it's kind of a one way thing. Yes, industrial might played a huge part in the war, but such a brilliant soldier (Carius really was, the man was amazing) should realize that its much more complicated than that. Still, i strongly recommend reading the book. Carius's account of the war is realy fascinating.
B0000CD5I6|4.0|Well, no. Thank the gods! Frankly, I really, REALLY don't care for traditional Christmas music. When I heard that Jethro Tull was going to release an album of exclusively Xmas music, I was worried and skeptical in equal measure. I mean, releasing a Christmas album is something akin to the kiss of musical death. It implies that the artist is either creatively bankrupt or is cashing-in those nostalgia bucks.<br />Happily, this isn't the case here. Longtime Tull fans know that Ian A. has a special place in his heart for the Winter Solstice/Yule/Christmas holiday(s), so the concept of a Xmas-based collection isn't incomprehensible. He and his band deliver in a big way on several tracks. \\"Holly Herald\\" is the most cheerful piece of music in the Tull repertoire, and should be a big concert fave for years to come. Speaking of concert faves, Tull's jazzy take of \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" has been a live staple for years. It was the most obvious selection for this set, and Martin Barre's guitar work is elegant, as is also Andrew Giddings' piano playing.<br />\\"Greensleeved\\" recalls Rahsaan Roland Kirk (one of the few Tull tunes to actually do so, you critics!), and \\"We Five Kings\\" is a tuneful recall of \\"Living In The Past\\" and the Brubeck sound of the sixties. \\"Pavane\\", like \\"Bouree\\", reworks orchestral music into the Tull folk/jazz-fussion mold that all the fans love. The new tunes all recall the Heavy Horses Tull that I fell in love with when I first heard that album, way back in...1993! Hell, I'm only twenty-seven, which by JT standards is virtually a newborn. \\"Last Man At The Party\\", \\"First Snow On Brooklyn\\", and \\"A Winter Snowscape\\" are particularly nice.<br />The re-recorded tunes are a mixed bag. \\"Jack Frost & The Hooded Crow\\" and \\"Another Christmas Song\\" are among Tull's greatest songs, and they sound even better here. \\"Bouree\\" is re-worked in a rhythmically dynamic way. Unfortunately, \\"A Christmas Song\\", \\"Fire At Midnight\\", and \\"Ring Out, Solstice Bells\\" lack the rich vocals and instrumental passion of the old versions.

B00000K19E|4.0|I thought this movie was fantastic, except all the unnecessary talking of crap on a pile of more crap.  The fighting scenes ruled and the action was perfect.  All in all this movie was 4 stars for me.
B0000084J7|5.0|Those who enjoyed Talk Talk's Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock should find much to love in this solo outing.  Do not expect virtuosity.  Coming into Mark Hollis with such an attitude will cause you to miss the point of this album.  This is about emotion, and the very frailties that make us human.  If you seek machine-like precision and processed-to-death sounds, look elsewhere.  Mark Hollis is a much more *intimate* album than that.  Imagine sitting in a circle of musicians, tucked safely away in a back room somewhere, playing without an audience, without pressure.  On occasion, a chair squeaks or someone misses a note, or someone joins in just ahead or behind where they &quot;should&quot;...but that's *not* what matters.  Instead, it is the private communion with each other, and with the music created between them, that matters.  Unconstrained, slowly flowing along from one song to the next, it's rather like a beautiful, spontaneous practice session committed to tape.  In today's world of grandeur and overprocessed everything, this is a value we've forgotten.  Perhaps that's why Mark Hollis so stirs the heart.<br />Mr. Hollis' voice and lyrics are as vulnerable as ever, and these soft, melancholy wanderings offer an intriguing contrast to the open, sometimes even refreshing, uplifting arrangements.  While never building into the crescendoes of Spirit of Eden's &quot;Inheritance&quot; or Laughing Stock's &quot;Ascension Day&quot;, there is certainly enough of interest to keep the ear engaged.  Soft and subtle are the key words here.  Listen for the murmurring choir in &quot;A life (1895-1915)&quot; for such beauty...I could live in that gorgeous section forever.<br />While, to be honest, I do not listen to most of the lyrics (they are rather depressing, but furthermore, Mr. Hollis has always focused on tone and expressiveness more than on clear enunciation anyway), I was very impressed by the lyrics of &quot;A new Jerusalem&quot;, which seem to capture quite accurately the desolation left in the aftermath of war.  This is the return of the shell-shocked soldier to a home that has been ravaged in his absence.  I showed this song to a friend who has been personally affected by war, and he was quite moved.  We both focused immediately, on our first listenings, on these lines:<br />&quot;Heaven burn me<BR>Should I swear to fight once more.&quot;<br />This song is lyrically on the level of &quot;New Grass&quot; or &quot;I Believe in You&quot;, and that alone is worth the price of the entire album, as well as the stunning music of &quot;A life (1895-1915)&quot;.  Of course, there is not a bad track to be found on this album.  If you cannot tolerate minimalism, imperfection, or improvisation, I recommend looking elsewhere--but if you can keep an open mind, Mark Hollis is well worth obtaining.  And, as with the solo works of Pink Floyd's keyboardist Rick Wright, this is an underappreciated work where too few copies were made--so be sure to get it before supplies run out.
0780622650|5.0|I was living out of the country and never heard the terrible reviews of this movie - and thank goodness!  If you approach this movie without any preconceptions - except those you bring as a fan of the original series, you will be impressed!  They couldn't have done a better job of capturing the original flavor of the series in this modern version.  Unlike other disappointing TV remakes where the new cast playing the characters you loved end up annoying you to tears (Just watch about 3 minutes of Beverly Hillbillies - then toss the DVD in the fire and stomp on your spectacles) - The casting for Lost in Space was dead-on perfect with high marks for Don (Matt LeBlanc) and Maureen-mom (Mimi Rogers); and especially high ones for Lacey Chabert, Gary Oldman, and Jack Johnson (Penny, Dr. Smith, and Will).  All three played the characters flawlessly with the added bonus that they all somewhat resemble the original characters.  And casting kids cannot be an easy task. (For annoying child actors, see Spy Kids). It is rare to find young performers who are really likeable.  In the beginning, Penny, appears to be a typical, superficial teen-aged mall Rat clone - and Will, a stereo-typical brainy brother.  But when they are thrown into an extraordinary situation - Just like Swiss-Family Robinson, they become extra-ordinary kids.  Will, just like in the series, becomes the Robot's best friend after he saves him from oblivion.  And Penny figures out that living on a flying saucer can be cool.  The updated Jupiter 2 is sleek, hot, and beautiful.  And they found a creative way to re-create the robot, in his full retro-1960's glory, without damaging the film's polished look.  Just as you would expect, there's a layer of corny, warm-fuzzy family schmaltz which at times will make you roll your eyes (like Judy's sappy flirting with Don), but THAT'S what qualifies this movie as a RE-make and NOT the \\"Revenge of Star Warz XXII\\".  In Lost in Space, there's lots of action, aliens, science fiction toys and gadgets, peril... What else do you need?  I'll tell you.  THis DVD has loads of extras, like interviews with the cast, deleted scenes and a SFX making video.  Get this if you love LOS.  You will be pleasantly surprised.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is the Ultimate DVD box set for any Alien or Sci-fi fan. The movie quality is supurb and the bonus features offer wonderful insight, literally hours of extras.  <BR>Alien and Aliens were the best of the series, very scary not just shock and awe but also psycologically disturbing.  Alien 3 and Alien Ressurection are weaker but still very entertaining.<BR>This is a must have. Just don't see them alone in the dark!
B00009UW0N|4.0|Ok, this movie wasn't that bad or that good.  It was ok.  Dr. Loomis is the best character in the Halloween series.  This movie wasn't really that informative about who Michael Myers is.  It did have some jolts and was pretty entertaining.  The rests of the series where assome, except 2 and 3 which sucked, , (Halloween 4-8 highly recomended)
B00005JMFR|3.0|After watching the first Matrix, i thought to myself, wow what an amazing movie, its one that makes you think all the while displaying non-stop action. Then The Matrix Reloaded came out (my personal favorite of all of them) and it was even better, more action, more noise, it was much more familiar than the first. Then we get to the sub-par 3rd installment. The Matrix Revolutions is by no means a crappy movie, tons of non-stop action and it fills in the holes from the previous 2 rightfrom the get-go. The only problem is that I was expecting the unexpected, in other words, anyone could tell what was going to happen, and that is what this movie lacked, mystery. It was more of an out there deal, you know whats going to happen. Bottom line is that if you liked the first two of course its a must see, even by anymeans its a must see.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|The first X-Men movie was not what many fans had expected it to be, simply because the first X-Men movie was simply introducing the characters to the audience. The thing that X-Men fans do not understand about these movies is that these movies are not meant specifically for just X-Men fans; because it is a massive production, it will reach a much broader audience that know nothing of what the X-Men are. Story has to be changed a little, but the layers of stories and characters will remain. Many of the aspects from the original X-Men story may be changed or added, but this was done with careful consideration to fans.<br />X-Men 2 picks up off where X-Men 1 left you, with the introduction of the main X-Men characters, Wolverine without remembrance of his origin, the love triangle between Wolverine, Jean Grey, and Cyclops, the differences between Magneto and Professor Xavier. Wolverine discovers his origin, as well as meeting his enemy and maker. The enemy in this story is not mutant threat as the first one, but rather the human side to evil, which is a nice touch. The school is attacked, and there is a threat to mutant kind. It shows new characters, new relationships and new alliances forming. Jean Grey is also evolving, which gives more insight into the next film. A new character is introduced, Nightcrawler, who is a much layered character and plays a significant part in the movie.<br />One of the major aspects of characters in this movie, as a sequel especially, the same actors/actresses return to play their characters. New characters are introduced as well, many subtle and only known to those X-Men fans out there. Each character is based off the comics, layered and each with their own personal stories, powers, and struggles. Though the number of characters to remember may be boggling to some, the movie clearly shows who is who, and what those individuals are. This movie simply shows glimpses of new characters: Colossus, Hank McCoy (Beast), Shadowcat, who will no doubt appear in the next X-Men film.<br />Action sequences are just awesome; they did not hesitate with special effects and stunts. It is constant set-up fight scenes, it leaves you just amazed and wondering on how they did certain effects. This movie does not leave you bored, and you have to see the movie to know what I am talking about. Let me just tell you that these action sequences are not to be missed. Some of the best so far that I have seen, even when compared to the Matrix trilogy. Wolverine actually kills people in this movie, something most people have been waiting for Wolverine to do.<br />Besides being such an awesome, character-filled movie, with great storyline, and awesome action and effects, it is very well thought-out, touching on the issue that X-Men 1 touched on: acceptance. This goes further into that area and whole idea of being different, and being hated for that reason. One must watch this movie to fully understand.<br />This DVD is a must for people who like this movie, or still haven't seen. It gives you the most incredible insight to the behind the movie, the thinking behind it, the ideas. It goes through action sequences, interviews with cast, and hours of other extras. Let me tell you that watching the movie, then the behind-the-scenes look really shows what kind of brilliant gem this movie is. It shows the origin of X-Men, comic books to movie screen, the story behind Nightcrawler, behind the effects of fight scenes, and more possible story lines for future X-Men movies. It also has commentaries from Bryan Singer, the director, and Newton Sigel, cinematographer, and writers and producer commentaries. The most significant feature is the ultimate making-of documentry. I have noticed many comments on the lack of closed-captioning. If you are deaf or hearing-impaired and need the CC, then you obviously have a TV that has CC on it. You don't need the DVD to have to do that for you. It wasn't a necessary addition to the DVD. Besides, it's too packed with other awesome extras to fit CC.<br />The movie is awesome for X-Men fans, awesome for movie fans who want to see some action and excitement, a thoroughly good movie. This movie does what a good movie does for everyone: leaves you with questions of what's going to happen, leaves you wanting to watch the next movie. It just leaves you saying, &quot;Cool&quot;.<br />I truly give this movie 5 stars: 1 star for avoiding the lable of a typical bad sequel, 1 star for continuing use of same actors/actresses and new characters, 1 star for awesome action sequences and effects, 1 star for the story continuing from the first movie and blending it still with the original comic book stories while keeping character and conflict interest, and the last star for just pulling it all off so well and being such an awesome, well-thought, well-coordinated film.<br />A movie that everyone, regardless a X-Men fan or movie fan, should watch at least once. Because if you like it the first time, it's guaranteed to watch it at least one more time.
B00004Y6RO|4.0|A music fan from Milwaukee, WI is wrong, considering Slipknot was not the first band in metal to do this. Other bands came before Slipknot with masks and etc that was also in the metal genre. For example Mushroomhead and The Berzerker. This cd is pretty good. I wouldn't say its the best metal cd I heard, but it was pretty good in its year time frame. If you like the nu metal type of music then this cd is perfect for a person of that genre specific, but if you like heavy metal with some thought provoking lyrics then listen to Mushroomhead(which was out in 1993 and they are still playing music.)
B000069I3K|5.0|I'm 15 and I think this movie is pure gold.  Asside from action and horror movies, this movie is fantastic.  No there is no killing or violence, that's what makes this movie unique.  I did not get bored one bit, and E.T. he's soooooooo cool.  The scene when they're on the bikes is my favorite.  Anyone who thinks this moving is boring, then I don't think your brain functions right, distruction is all you wanT than go see House of the Retards i meen Dead, I died watching that movie  or other plotless movies that show people killing people for fun.  Yes horror movies and action movies can be fun but not all the time.  trust me watch this movie and you'll feel like a kid again!!!!!!!!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|If all the albums in the world were like Christina's (Matured and about life and stuff) then there would be no variety. I mean Britney's a different artist and Christina'a different. So far from what I've read it's all about how the lyrics aren't like Christina's and her voice isn't like Christina's. Hello?? If it was, then Britney would be another Christina! Britney's an artist in her own style and her style's changed now. You should give this album a try and ignore the one-star reviews written by people who just hate Britney. I love every song. (Except early morning) So do check it out!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I'm french and i'm only 15, so excuse me for my english .<BR>I would just say that this movie is exceptional. It's the best movie about the world war II's american soldiers I hav ever seen!<BR>I really like it, i have seen it many times. The actors are rights .It's really moving . I think that is really good to honour this soldiers with this mini sries, to not forgotten their action. <BR>They are an exemple and a lesson of courage for all.<BR>I would say them thank for their help, them so young who were so well , happy and quiet at home in America and who come to help Europe to find the way of freedom.<BR>I recommend this movie with you all.
B000003S2K|5.0|Ambient 1 is a simple piano, the angelic chorus of an electronic choir. Subtle, soft, repeating, meter-less loops of sound. Peaceful, yet longing. Initially non-descript. With subsequent listenings, it is memorably relaxing, a non-intrusive, background for the scenery in the room. This is my favorite album by ENO defining the genre of ambient music and soundscapes. It has been my choice as the background music for some of the most memorable, emotional moments in my life. It is a work of genius and I cannot recommend it enough.
B00005JLTM|5.0|Go ahead and buy the VHS version of this if you find it cheap. I was worried that I would not get the same movie theater effect, but the VHS is rather good. <br />At the end of the VHS there is: A short trailer for Revolutions, and a Director's interview of 4 TV commericals that used the matrix theme. You get all this on the VHS version. Therefore you don't have to struggle with cumbersome menu commands, or insert Disk 2.<br />Don't be adicted to DVDs. Save some money.
0767830555|5.0|Truly beautiful in a way that many movies aren't. Honestly one of the best screenplays ever written, Taxi Driver can't be beat. My favorite of Scorcese's films(and my favorite ever).<br />Taxi Driver revolves around a Vietnam war veteran who works as a taxi driver. He is the example of an alienated human being. He tries at first to win over Betsy, a political campaigner regularly by taking her to lunch, and a movie, etc. When that fails, he begins to realize that she is like the rest of them. He then tries to save a young prostitute, Iris, by... well you're gonna have to see it for yourself.<br />Nominated for Four oscars, if that makes any difference.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Follow Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, U.S. Army. An elite rifle company parachuting into France early on D-Day morning. Suffering heavy casualities through out the war.      The performances are incredible and the action is intense. Story lines are easy enough to follow. However trying to indentify the different guys who die is hard sometimes.       I would recommend this to everyone!
B00009TB5G|3.0|I love this movie - but many of the extra scenes don't mesh very well or break the mood.  Case in point, toward the end of the movie, an extra scene involving Fangorn forest and the destruction of the Uruk-Hai after the battle of Helm's Deep abruptly cuts to Aragorn hugging Eowyn and then abruptly cuts to another scene with no transition.  Also, many of the extra scenes are humorous, but they don't fit in the overall somber mood of the movie - such as when Pippin and Merry discover all the food and tobacco that Saruman is hoarding in Isengard.  One scene that should not have been deleted is a scene in Osgiliath (a flashback), involving Faramir, Boromir and their father.  This scene explains a lot about what drives Faramir and helps to flesh out Boromir....
0790744295|4.0|Now heres some saturday night fun. Put the kiddies to bed and pop this in. Its a series of short films and theres one for everyone. First, its not scary stuff. Sorry stevie and george, i just didnt feel my legs quaking on this one. But hey, i had a good time anyway. Who can't get a chuckle out of good old pops wanting to know &quot;wheres my pie!&quot;...And the one with the guy who gives his wife to the new friend in the box, precious! My favorite of the bunch was with the bugs. I know people like the old codger in this one. Fitting, very fitting. So if you want the horror lite version of the saturday night gorefests, this is a good one. Consider it an apetizer to more sinister and bloodier fare you might have on tap. <BR>DVD wise, pretty average. To average. and whats with the 2.0 sound! come on!
B00009V7RF|5.0|Ok, the first time I listened to it it felt... strange. Something i haven't never heard. i was going to regret buyin' it. Only good songs seemed to be &quot;where is the love&quot;, &quot;shut up&quot; and 2the anxiety&quot;, which was very different from other songs in this album. It sounded like Metallica in some places...<BR>  But then... I listened to it again. And i liked it. Second time it was better... and third time i loved it!!! <br />anyway if i say it honestly i really didn't like &quot;Where is the love&quot; @ the first time i heard it too...
0446530891|3.0|Being a native Virginian, I'm a big David Baldacci fan.  This book starts out great.  The action and plot are gripping.  Then about 3/4 into the book, the story bogs down,and becomes difficult to trudge through.  Perhaps one problem is the use of too many characters to follow.  I had a hard time keeping characters straight.  The final 1/4 of the book takes some bizarre (if not unbelievable) turns.  Overall, not a bad read.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I first heard Gavin when he appeared on 'Last Call with Carson Daly'and sang Chariot.  I knew immediately I was hearing something special and wanted to buy his CD the next day. I was devastated to find out it wasn't being released for almost 2 more months....It was worth the wait!  I purchased the CD the day it was released and it has not left my CD player since.  Gavin has a depth to his music that is very rare to find today. His soulful lyrics and fantastic piano playing keep me listening again and again.  There is not one song that needs to be skipped over on this CD.  In my opinion each song is a contender for a Grammy (yes, it's that good!)Everyone I play this CD for is instantly hooked and immediately goes out to purchase it. I would strongly recommend purchasing the CD.  Don't pass up the opportunity to hear something you will never forget.
B00007KKXJ|5.0|Often imitated but never truly duplicated.  What can one say about Stevie that has not already been tatooed in our minds?  Songs in the Key of Life is the benchmark of music genius.   Spiritual, soulful, introspective only begin to exemplify what a treasure this CD has been to my collection-which includes 5,500 various artists.  My travels started in Birmingham, England, with stops in Boston, New York and now Atlanta, Georgia, and there is not a place on my musical journey where Songs in the Key of Life was not warmly received.<br />Artists like Omar, the late Bob Marley, Maxwell, Common,The Roots, and the late Tupac (just to name a few) owe their career sucess to Stevie Wonder, and this CD is the ultimate key to life.
B00005JM02|5.0|I would just like to say that this movie is the funniest movie ever!  It appeals to both young kids and adults because the humor can have so many different meanings.  Everything about this movie, from the voices, to the animation, to the storyline and characters makes this movie hysterically funny, fresh and just plain grereat!  I have watched this movie several times, the first being in the theaters, and I was about to roll down the aisle from laughing so hard!  I think I liked it more than the little kids there!  The DVD is also packed with great inside featers, games, stories and more.  IF YOU SEE ONE DISNEY MOVIE THIS YEAR, YOU MUST SEE FINDING NEMO!!!!!!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I've been a dedicated fan of Dream Theater for over 5 years, starting with their first albums and buying more recent ones, discovering that every album was different from all other. There were serious doubts if DT is able to record even better music than they had on SFAM or Awake or any other album. The only way for their music not to be received as 'old' is to make it totally different. This was a short introduction to TOT. It's DRASTICALLY different. Those who expect reminiscents of old stuff may be dissapointed at first, but don't sell the album or put it on the shelf! Expansion of musical horizon is what keeps DT's music 'up to date' and differs them from other bands that try to do the same thing for 20 years and stop getting new listeners after 10. I think ToT is an excellent album because it reaches people who would never listen to DT. Some say it reminds so called 'nu-metal' too much, but when you give it multiple listens, multiple music layers show up. Believe me, the music is superior. Of course, Dream Theater isn't the band it used to be 10 years ago, but that is far from bad (as it is with Metallica for instance). You could listen to WDADU or Images and Words for your whole life because you think their later music is crap, but imagine what you would be missing. Dream Theater are pacing not only forward but take new directions with every album. Isn't it the thing that really keeps ordinary rock from being progressive? I guess making things new and fresh is what the word 'progressive' really means.

B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce Knowles indefinitely is an amazing artist and is very zestful, in this CD there are definitely references made to her mysterious lover Jay Z, in the song signs. While listening to her CD it kind of threw me off because she begins to talk about being crazy in love and in the song me my self and I she begins to go into a depressed disposition and leak all of her personal idiosyncrasies. Overall I must say Cudos
B0000CDLA7|2.0|It's a boring mush. What ever happened to the cohesive tight little songs they used to write? Why does everything have to segue into a Spinal Tap-Esque Metaljazz Odyssey a la LTE? Under A Glass Moon wipes the earth with everything on ToT. Come to think of it, so too does Hell's Kitchen, and another ToT: Trial of Tears, from the very overly maligned and underly rated Falling Into Infinity. There's more passion and artistry in the guitar solo from Lines in the Sand than in the whole of Train of Thought. <br />Nice cover, though.
B0000C83YJ|5.0|LMAO! Clowns caress you? What is that? Figures undress your fears? HAHAHAHAHAAHAHA. Those are the funniest lines I have ever heard in my entire life. I am not joking. Get this album for the song &quot;That's The Way&quot; and listen to it. You will say to yourself &quot;Did he just say clowns caress you?&quot; My friend, he just did.
B000065KFV|5.0|For those who wondered how the director of &quot;Bad Taste&quot; and &quot;Brain Dead&quot; got to direct &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; this 1994 film from director Peter Jackson supplies the answer. In 1954 two teenage girls brutally murdered one of the their mothers in what must be the most sensational murder in New Zealand history. &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; tells the strange story of these two girls and their unique relationship. If you think this is just a reality based splatter flick, then you are going to be much more than surprised and impressed by what Jackson has accomplished.<br />Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) is a simple and rather dull young girl who is totally dazzled when Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) enters her life. Juliet is impressed as well, because Pauline has a scar on her leg from an operation. Juliet declares that: &quot;All the best people have had chest and bone disease! It's all frightfully romantic!&quot; Eventually both the romance and the frightfullness of it all reaches a tragic conclusion. In their all consuming friendship Juliet and Pauline create a &quot;Fourth World,&quot; better than heaven (because it has no Christians), inhabited by the clay figures they have fashioned to represents their friends and where the music of Mario Lanza, the greatest tenor on earth, is always in the air.<br />Jackson brings this fantasy world alive, which allows him to explore the pivotal theme of juxtaposition throughout the film. This comes into play most notably at the beginning and ending of &quot;Heavenly Clouds.&quot; Jackson begins with a 1950s newsreel about Christchurch, New Zealand, which is interrupted by the appearance of the two screaming and bloodied girls, thereby symbolizing the way this sensational case shocked the nation. Even more effective is the film's conclusion, where the murder is inter-cut with what the girls think will happen if they do not find this way of saving themselves.<br />With any film based on historical events there are omissions, alterations, substitutions, and the like, and &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; is no different. On the plus side of the ledger Jackson attempted an almost morbid verisimilitude. Almost all of the locations used for filming were the real locations where events occurred, including the tea shop where Honora Parker ate her last meal, which was torn down a few days after the shooting ended. However, the cast and crew found the actual murder scene uncomfortable and moved further down the path. All of the journal voice-overs come directly from Pauline's diary, as are the characters in the girls' make-believe world. However, since the two filled up fifteen notebooks and hundreds of letters devoted to their fantasies, the movie actually underplays these elements.<br />However, having familiarized myself somewhat with the actual &quot;facts&quot; of the case, and the recollections of the woman one of the girls grew up to be, the key point of dispute is the motive. But if Jackson is guilty of becoming fixated on the idea that these two young girl committed a murder because they could not bear to be separated and have their fantasy world unravel, then he can be hardly faulted for finding that a fascinating interpretation of the evidence (the girls never testified or were examined in court, but Pauline's diary was seen as providing all the answers). More importantly, Jackson does not seem guilty of taking gratuitous liberties.  Instead he is offering a valid interpretation of the evidence. For example, the murder sequence greatly reduces the number of blows, but the effect is still horrific where the sounds alone can force you to shut your eyes, so it seems trivial to complain about any inaccuracy given the scene's effectiveness.<br />From an artistic standpoint Jackson's interpretation is more than justified, especially at the end. In addition to the information we receive between the final scene and the closing credits that tells what happened to Pauline and Juliet, Marzio Lanza sings &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone,&quot; which is as perfect a choice of a song to play at the end of a film as you will ever hear, forcefully underscoring the film's thesis. Jackson says this is &quot;a murder story about love, a murder story with no villains,&quot; and it is hard to argue with this idea after watching his film.<br />&quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; received an Oscar nomination for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Jackson and Frances Walsh. The film won every award for which it was nominated in the New Zealand Film and TV Awards, including Best Actress for Lynskey and Best Foreign Performer for Winslet (both of whom were perfectly suited for those roles), and earned film festival awards in Venice and Toronto. This is a striking and unforgettable film, both creative and thoughtful. Those who are drawn to it because it was directed by Peter Jackson might be shocked by the subject matter, but they will not be disappointed with the results.line and Juliet, Marzio Lanza sings &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone,&quot; which is as perfect a choice of a song to play at the end of a film as you will ever hear, forcefully underscoring the film's thesis.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney's 4th album is actually really good! It's more diverse and mature...Way less cheese and filler for sure. Get a taste of her album and you WILL hear the difference...trust me!<BR>Britney is an entertainer...She is not meant to be taken seriously. She is all about going out dancing and having fun. Something that been lacking due to the stale, strict, and often too meaningful world of music we have now. Make sure to CHECK OUT her bonus songs that weren't on the US version of &quot;In The Zone&quot; like the bump and grind techno song &quot;The Answer&quot;, the sonic new age-like ballad &quot;Don't Hang Up&quot;, and the very RARE retro-electro-rock lite &quot;I Just Begun(Having My Fun)&quot;.
B00014NE62|5.0|I fell under the spell of this underrated masterpiece many, many years ago and practically wore out my original VHS copy while patiently awaiting the release of the DVD.  It's quite an enchanting film indeed!  More than anything else, this is a satisfying love story painted with characters and settings that will definitely transport you to another time and place!  I like the new cover art too!  Can't wait until February!-----MoonWing Pamela
B00005JMCN|4.0|\\"You don't throw something away just because it's banged up a bit,\\" says trainer Tom Smith of his current horse with a wounded leg.  This proverbial line of dialogue presents one of the major themes of Seabiscuit; it's a film about second chances, turning nothing into something, and rising to victory during the darkest of times and circumstances (the fight of the underdog).  The film borrows its title from the legendary racehorse Seabiscuit, who rose from the depths of mediocrity and assumed worthlessness to become a vastly adept racer capable of remarkable things.  Long before \\"The Biscuit\\" ever set hoof in an arena, he already had one strike against him: he was too small. To boot, he was notoriously lethargic with a violent temperament. After the horse shook too many disappointed heads and caused too many grimaces (resulting in him being shoved from owner to owner at rock-bottom prices), his career as a racehorse was finally given the chance to flourish as he falls into the caring hands of hard-working and determined automotive businessman Charles Howard. He employs empathetic trainer Tom Smith, who had worked with less-than-perfect horses in the past, and young jockey Red Pollard, a bruised-and-battered boxer who also happens to be 5'7\\"-considered too tall for a jockey and a perfect match for the likewise imperfect Seabiscuit.  The band of underdogs finally set out to race, and together they bring Seabiscuit to victory and acclaim, while simultaneously helping each other to accomplish their goals and realize their dreams. And because this story is true, their triumphs become all the more satisfying and genuine.<br /><br />The film shines courtesy of outstanding performances by the lead actors.  In \\"period pieces\\" such as this one, actors are presented with a double-challenge: say the lines passionately and believably, and be able to make the character realistic within the context of that period.  The period in this film is the 1930s, in the wake of the Great Depression, and the performances by Jeff Bridges, Tobey Maguire and Chris Cooper beautifully reflect the feelings, the dreams, and the ideology belonging to many people during the period.  It was wise for the filmmakers to emphasize the historical context in which the story of Seabiscuit took place: such aforementioned ideals of hard work and determination are greatly enhanced by the circumstances of this disappointing time in history.  Rather than completely delineating the back-stories of each of the central characters, the filmmakers give us snippets of what looks to be extracted straight from a Depression documentary, using still images and dictated factual information to bolster our understanding of the early-30s zeitgeist.  We can then slip into the characters' stories en media res and clearly understand each of their motives.  The film also boasts technical prowess. The cinematography is often used creatively to represent elements of the theme.  At times, the higher-angle shots can be quite breathtaking.  The editing works well; a fine mixture of extended shots and quick cutaways captures all of the nail-biting suspense of horseracing.<br />Seabiscuit is an inspiring and beautifully told story of the ability to achieve even the most impossible of goals during the most unforgiving of circumstances.ion, and the performances by Jeff Bridges, Tobey Maguire and Chris Cooper beautifully reflect the feelings, the dreams, and the ideology belonging to many people during the period.

B000127LW2|5.0|In the year 1987, I fell in love...with Star Trek.  I was 4 when I watched the original broadcast premier of TNG in our livingroom.  I sat through the whole thing without falling asleep, and since then I've made it a point to watch each and every episode of each series.  After TNG ended, DS9 came along and filled the void...very admirably I might add.  After that was Voyager, and then Enterprise (which I think is a great show).  I have to say that although I enjoyed all the different series, Voyager was different.  Captain Janeway had to fulfill not only the duties of a Starship Captain, but she also had to become a friend to her crew while simultaneously heading back toward the Alpha Quadrant, making new allies and enemies every day. To me, this added a new dimension to the show that had not been present in the rest.  Over the course of seven great seasons there were, of course, episodes which should have been written better...every show has them.  But to me, the true judge of a show's character is not necessarily how many 'excellent' episodes there are, but rather the stories they choose to tell, and the way they choose to tell them.  Star Trek has always been about the imagination, and Star Trek Voyager is a wonderful example of the imagination at work.  All of the shows are.  TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager, and even Enterprise (which I think, after three seasons has finally found its place) are all a part of the greatest story ever told, and no story is complete without all its parts.  May Star Trek live long and prosper...as may all of you.  Thanks for reading my review! :)
B0000C6E4D|3.0|compare to the last few Albums, the lastest album is not a very &quot;suprising' CD indeed. Not a fresh one and th style remain the same. Anyway, still very appreciated to hear Sarah's angle's voice, although the songs are not really  special. Maybe the high expectation of the CD makes things worse. Recommand first time listeners to buy the concert &quot;MirrorBall&quot; rather than this one.
B00005NGZX|5.0|After owning &quot;Jane Doe&quot; for almost two years, I simply must say that this album is ESSENTIAL to any hxc/open-minded music fan. This album is not just mind-bending insanity, it is a pure work of art. The drums are fast and brutal, guitar work is amazing, and Jacob Bannon's vocals are absolutely incredible. If you don't own this album, I pity you and suggest strongly without a doubt that you pick this up.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I thought that this was a really good album and would be really helpful to those just starting to listen to the band. My only complaint was that it would have been cool if Jim DeRogatis did the liner notes. If you've read his book, Milk It!, you'd know what I mean. But that wasn't the music, and the music is what really matters.
0783229526|4.0|&quot;Fear and Loathing&quot;, like many of Gilliam's films, is an excellent artistic rendition of the darker side of the American dream. Much of the movie, however, will be lost to general audiences as it is blurred and obscured by ramblings and drug induced incoherence. But, the film still manages to grant us a well crafted snapshot of the psychodelic drug craze that most of us, hopefully, have not experienced, and proves to be incredibly funny and entertaining in the process. So, take this movie with a grain of salt. Don't dig too hard for the deeper meanings and linear plot; just relax, laugh, and don't think about it until it's through.
B000053VAF|4.0|\\"DOGMA\\" is a good movie. It's incredibly bizarre, but in an interesting way.  Some may hate it--sex is mentioned, drugs are used, and language abounds.<br />Alan Rickman, as Metatron, is excellent and probably the best actor in the film. Matt Damon & Ben Affleck (renegade angels banished to Wisconsin for the entire span of human history) are actually quite good, and their friendship comes across.<br />My only complaint with this movie is that it could be so much more polished.  The story line is a little choppy and jumpy in some places, the language could be cut down (not because I find it offensive, but because it disrupts what the characters are trying to SAY), and some of the drug usage (do we really need to see an angel smoking weed?) is absolutely pointless. <br />Good movie, though, with good points. If you're interested in watching it, rent it.  Chances are you'll hate it--or love it.
1563894696|3.0|To compare this with Batman year one is an insult to Batman year one. The ridiculous parade of batman foes, all of them just crammed into the story to satisfy brainless fans, is dissapointing. Not a single one of them is of real importance to the plot. You can really forget about them. And the captions in every single issue, telling you who is who, you can really see how the Long Halloween was more of a marketing excersise than anything else.<br />Now, that aside, the art is great, as the ending, and also the transformation of Harvey Dent. This is a good comic book, but by no means a great one. If Loeb had only worked with the crime families this would have been a much better story.<br />Do not believe the hype. Read at leas the first part before you buy this, decide then.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Simply outstanding. It is really a gem of a DVD. I loved all the extras and the special features. The commentaries were fantastic. The Hero of Canton was so funny, he made me cry. The special effects are like nothing else I had ever seen on television before. I would recommend this to any science fiction fan out there. Even if you are not a science fiction fan, you will love the character interactions in this show.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|If your a George Harrison/Beatle fan, then your probably going to purchase this DVD and accompanying CD. I don't need to convince you. If your a music fan, and want the best DVD concert for your collection, then please pick this up. You won't be sorry! One year to the day after George's death, Eric Clapton gathered many of George's friends and musicians (many of those who were on the original recordings) at the Royal Albert Hall, for a benefit concert honoring George's life &amp; works. I had honestly forgotten how many great songs George wrote, (many are included on the DVD) and what a talented song writer he was. If George's songs doesn't want too make you run out and buy this DVD, then the all star line up on stage should. Where else can you see Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, Billy Preston plus to many else to mention here, onstage, all at once. Truly remarkable &amp; historical! This DVD will make you laugh, cry, and even have a chill run down your spine watching George's son Dhani (who is the spitting image of his father) playing guitar onstage. Trust me...buy this DVD, turn the lights down low, crank up the sound, and reminisce. You will truly enjoy watching this concert over and over and over again!
B00005JMF6|5.0|This movie was so awesome! I'm definitely buying it on DVD! As a Doctor who has spent considerable time in Psychiatry, I really found this movie interesting on that level. It's a tad bit weird, but you'll love it, trust me!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Well, for all of you A Perfect Circle fans, whether new or old, this is a great album. It did what no one imagined could be done; followed their first, Mer De Noms. Of course, no one wants the same album as the last and APC gives you more, more hard hitting, ars kicking, punches as well as great bass, especially on &quot;The Package&quot; by our good friend, Twiggy, great guitars from ex-Smashing Pumpkins man James Iha and Billy, and of course great melodic placebos for Maynard's lyrics. <br />You won't get the first album, but you won't be dissapointed. It will grow on you and drive you insane. Enjoy!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This is my favorite ganster movie. For me this is the best ganster movie i've ever seen in my whole life.
B00008NRLX|4.0|The problem with the Jayhawks is that they don't fit a genre.  Country stations will play them rarely, and Adult Contemporary stations even less.  The beauty of this band is that they have their own quasi-country sound, and in my opinion they are more melodic and better crafted than the similar Wilco.  Try this album... it's different than the past few, and better in many ways.  Rolling Stone gave this album a great review for good reason.  Check it out.
0790729725|5.0|This movie was one and maybe the best mob movie the great Martin Scorsese has ever made. The acting was awesome. Pesci, De Niro and Liotta were at their best. The whole movie was GREAT!!!!!!!!!
B000068IEU|1.0|hi, guys, give me a break! What are all these hypes for? This is one of the stupidest movie I have ever seen! The plot is too stupid to be believed. I will give it 0 star if I could. If you want to see anything disturbing, creepy, skip this movie!
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather I II and III(the weakest one of all but a great movie anyway) are the best mafia movies i've ever seen so far.
B00003CXI0|5.0|This film is ace, not quite as good as the second, but certainly better than the book. I didn't like the book i thought it was boring. This film is a MUST SEE. Great action and great magic. All though it is not real, i thought that it was great how they did it. It would be ace if magic was real, then you could use wands. I have watched this film lots of times, and never got fed up with it. I hope number three comes out soon, i am dying to see it. If you like films with magic, you will like this film.
0783225792|5.0|Martin Scorsese does it again and again. This why he's one of my favorite directors. He always makin' great gangsters movies and this is one is not the exeption. When De Niro and Pesci get together with Scorsese they always score big. Casino is one of the best gangster movie i've ever seen and i recomended to everyone who enjoys ganster movies.
B00005JM02|5.0|The humor as well as visuals that this movie contains can be enjoyed by all ages.  A great gift idea as well.
B0000AM6JI|5.0|This was a great mob movie. Pacino is always at his best and in this movie he does a great acting again. For me this movie was  scarface with a twist.
0385337388|5.0|In this age of reality TV, many will be fascinated, repelled, disturbed and intrigued about this look in the life of a resident intern at a large teaching hospital.  For those in the know, it is a sarcastic yet honest glimpse of the perils of an intern.<br />  House of God focuses on Dr. Roy Basch- a new intern who is working at a large teaching institution.  Like all interns, he is thrown in with the instruction to &quot;keep the patient alive.&quot;  He battles grueling schedules, hopeless patients, attendings and disease.  He learns from the chief, interns and residents--and even the patients &quot;gomers&quot;.<br />  For those who are unfamiliar with medical training this book would be very disturbing, but for those of us who know what residents go through...it is surprisingly real.  I first read this book as an M4- just about to start July 1st internship.  As an M4 you are cocky, arrogant and optimistic and this book was funny, sacriligous even.  I read it again after finishing residency and was struck by how honest it was to the residency experience..sometimes painfully so.<br />I liked the book when i first read it, but i can appreciate it more now...It is surprising that the author was able to capture the feelings of interns and be brave enough to put it into book form.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|For anyone who missed the amazing opportunity to see this show for the limited time it was on TV, I strenuously recommend this boxed set, you will not be disappointed.  For those of us lucky enough to have seen it during its short run, this DVD set is all that remains, and we relish finally being able to see it as it was meant to be seen.  In its original order, in widescreen format as originally shot, and with original content, before Firefly had to go back and change things in an effort to make it work for Fox.  The commentary itself is a reason to buy this set, never before have I seen and heard more passion from a cast and crew than those who had the pleasure to work on this show and who wholeheartedly believe that it is the most fulfilling work they will ever do.  And to Joss Whedon, who created this beautiful masterpiece and continues to work everyday to see that it finds a way to continue, all Firefly fans are greatly appreciative.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|I recently purchased the 2-DVD set of the Concert for George and, desiring to listen to it in the car over and over and over again, went out and picked up the 2-CD soundtrack. Overall, marvelous and just as spectacular as the audio on the DVD. One gripe--the track &quot;Horse To The Water&quot;, performed by Jools Holland on the DVD and featuring a blistering Tom Scott sax solo, was left off. Otherwise, I think all the concert tracks (save for the Monty Python numbers) are included. This set is sure to see some wear and tear in the Honda over the coming weeks, and is a perfect complement to the DVD set. Well done!
B0000636UN|1.0|Es una lastima anunciar que La Sheryl Crow de &quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot; Y del Disco THE GLOBE SESSIONS, Se vendio al pop mas infraganti y meloso como melcocha de mascar.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|Well after reading the comments about Alien the Directors Cut in DTS I decided to play the DVD last night, I wanted to wait till around Christmas but a couple of people had stated that this DVD with the parameters I mentioned above locked on them during playback. There was also a South African gentlemen that wanted to see if this was true. Well I have a Panasonic RP-91 and it played Alien Disc 1 Directors Cut DTS with no problems. I recently sold my Alien Legacy set to purchase this one and received mine from Amazon on it's release date. The packaging is nowhere near as bad as others are complaining about, it is actually very similiar to the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions. Grant LOR may have slightly thicker cardboard but the DVD storage areas are the same. It is a little cumbersome to open the entire collection so I have been opening a half at a time which makes it about as long as Lord of the Rings Extended edition DVDs. I have only viewed Alien thus far as per my comments above but the picture quality is awesome. I mean it looks like a new movie and the quality is very close to Lord of the Rings, remember we are talking about a movie that is almost 25 years old! The DTS track really added space and depth to the sound track and FX effects. The spoken audio was only slightly better than the Legacy 5.1 track but the music and FX were a night and day difference from the Legacy audio track. I own over 500 DVDs and I would say hands down this is the best box set I own surpassing the likes of Band of Brothers, Scarface, ET, Spiderman, Die Hard Trilogy, Lord of the Rings, Godfather, Indiana Jones, etc... All of the above that I just mentioned I own as well.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Now, you have to understand that this a <BR>Britney Spears album that you are considering. Not the greatest singer, but a performer for Generation Y. I am comparing this album to her three previous albums, so if you haven't heard all three other albums, then think of ITZ this way. Adult Pop with SOME sexual lyrics with a touch of electronic music (Breath on Me, Touch of my hand), and the rest subtle hip-hop Pop. Her voice and experimentation depart from her typically recognized sound of Opps!, or one more time. IF \\"Slave 4u\\" wasn't on her last album, it would be on this one. So if you have read all these bad reviews, it's because it's being compared to the enormous collection of great albums out there. This is Britney's best CURRENTLY. It's like Madonna's \\"True Album\\". Slighty pop like \\"Virgin\\" album, but heading to the directoin of the 'take me serious' statement of \\"Like A Prayer\\". This album isn't like her previous album, it more bold, experimental, and mellow. Don't expect a Sgt. Pepper or Ray of Light.
B0000E1WKE|3.0|What happened to Whitney's voice? She sounds so low and hoarse. The only song that really soars is Who Would Imagine A King? from The Preachers Wife which was done years ago. If you loved Whitney then it's bittersweet listening to the this album. It's like looking the ruins of a palace and wondering what happend. <br />On the plus side, Whitney does make do with what voice she has left and this album has more 100 times more style and warmth than Ahsanti's Christmas effort.
B000003S28|4.0|'Music For Films' was my first Brian Eno purchase.  It was a good choice, because it prompted me to check out many of his other works as well.  <br />The best description of the album I could give is that Brian presents 18 portholes into 18 different worlds that range from ethereal to downright eerie.  It's perfect for late light listening in the dark with headphones.    <br />Recommended for any Brian Eno fan, or anyone who enjoyed the instrumental tracks on David Bowie's 'Low' and 'Heroes.'
B000002JSJ|5.0|This is probably the most emotional album for Zeppelin.  It comes at a time when Zeppelin has reached the epitome of stardom.  Everyone knows their songs and knows who they are.  The band has matured and this album shows that.  This album comes after a hard time for Robert Plant.  his smoking has finally affected his vocal range and he had just recovered from a car accident.  And soon after, his son Karac died.  So the emotion in Plant's voice is evident.  The highlights of this album are Achilles Last Stand and Tea for One.  Two of Zeps best songs of all time.  Achilles Last Stand is Jimmy Page's masterpiece of overdubbing and is phenomenal.  Tea for One is my all time fave zep tune.  It is their bluesiest song and has so much emotion in it that it's barely comprehendable.  The solo is magnificent, with page recording it in just one day! Don't let this overlooked album slip by you.  Check it out, it's just plain ole hard rocking Zeppelin.  No acoustic guitar or keyboards here, just plain rock!
B00005JM02|5.0|Disney and Pixar are on a roll! It's starting to seem that they can do no wrong. <br />The movie begins with a sad introduction, dealing with how Marlin, a clown fish, and his son Nemo are on their own. But, the sadness doesn't last too long, jumping on to Nemo's first day of school, where the story takes off! Nemo is kidnapped, or should I say fishnapped, by a scuba-diver, leaving his overly cautious father to face his fears and save him. Along the way he meets scatterbrained Dory, a blue Tang fish, who is just as much hindrance as help. From there the two fish encouter fish friendly sharks, squishy jellyfish, surfin' sea turtles, monstrous whales, and the most hilarious adventure of their fishy lives. And remember! Just keep swimming... just keep swimming... just keep swimming...
B00008PW2E|5.0|this show gives me goosebumps every time I watch it.  I'd say it's more of an emotional rollercoaster than the sopranos, which is also excellent but just can't live up to six feet under in my mind.  truly, this show is one of a kind, and it has never failed to amaze and move me.<br />I'm surprised it hasn't come out on DVD yet--they've been far more forthcoming with their other series, but perhaps that's not saying much.  well, I'll be waiting here, impatiently.  hopefully they'll get the picture that pretty soon, only the core audience will be remaining, and their cult hit will begin to lean more toward &quot;cult&quot; and less toward &quot;hit&quot;.  and in terms of a show as fine as this, that'd be a shame.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The first Anime movie I ever saw was Princess Mononoke, when my friend forced me to watch it at her tenth b-day sleepover.  I loved that so much, that when SPirited Away came out, I made my mom see it at the  first show that wasn't sold out-9:30 PM at the Pavilion in Prospect PArk.  I was completely blown away.<br />This movie tells the story of an whiny, slightly spoiled girl named Chihiro (Daveigh Chase, Lilo and Stitch) who is extremely unhappy about moving to a new place.  On the way there, her father gets the family lost on a detour.  The family finds themself at the entrance to a tunnel. Upon walking through, the come out in a train station.  But when Chihiro's father follows his nose to an apparently abandoned but full concession stand at an abandoned amusement park, he and Chihiro's mother start stuffing their faces.  When Chihiro, apparently not hungry, goes to explore she meets a young man who warns her to go go back through the tunnel before it gets dark.  Then, when Chihiro returns to get her parents, she finds they have been horrifically transformed-into pigs!  Chihiro then goes to the same young man-Master Haku, for help.  She gets a job working in a bathhouse in the spirit world!  While there, Chihiro must use her own brilliance to outwit the wonderfully nasty witch, Yubaba who owns the bath house, defeat the clever, lonely monster, No-Face, and think back to her childhood to help haku find his name, all in a brilliantly crafty, beautifully drawn and voiced, and expertly told.<br />  Susan Egan does a remarkable job as Lin, Chihiro's (Sen)caretaker and advisor, while Jason Marsden ultimately brings life into Haku.  Suzanne Pleshette makes the devilish Yubaba and the motherly Zeniba seem real, while David Ogsen Stiers, voices the spider-like boiler man Kamaji.  But by far, the best voice in this film was that of Chihiro (Daveigh Chase)  her adorable, high pitched tone fits Chihiro perfectly.<br />  If you like anime, this film is a must-see.  Better by far than Princess Mononoke (even though that was really good)  By the way, if you think that Haku's voice sounds familiar, he sounds like Riku from Kingdom Heartsthan Princess Mononoke (even though that was really good)  By the way, if you think that Haku's voice sounds familiar, he sounds like Riku from Kingdom Hearts
B00003CXTG|1.0|This must be one of the worst movies ever made in the history of Hollywood. Nothing about this movie ring true and it have to be one of the most insulting movies to Pearl Harbor veterans ever made - even if you happened to be a Japanese veteran! None of the characters are believable, the love interest felt so superifical that you are in awe of the actors who actually went through the motion. The attack on Pearl Harbor have to be one of the greatest fisco ever shot on film. All the fake smoke, noise and destruction. Worst of all were the manipulative emotional chain yanking. The sad thing was, the attack on Pearl Harbor was so poorly done that it almost look comical and unless you are a total dunce, you know that you are having your chain yanked so entire sequences looked like a put on job. I can't believed that they opened this movie on an aircraft carrier at Pearl Harbor with invited veterans of the attack. What a torture that must have been!! Funny thing about this movie was that nothing worked. Love story don't work, military history don't work and acting don't work. I think the movie insulted just about every one involved presently and all those who were there back in 1941.
B0000AI45P|5.0|Marquee Moon is simply one of the 10 best hipster<BR>records ever made. Mike, the owner of Subterranean <BR>records in NYC, puts it squarely at #1. Every single song <BR>on this record is stellar. It is Passionate, explorative,<BR>and firmly on its own unique course. It is rich in<BR>flavor, and defys deconstruction. Due to its quirky<BR>uniqueness, this album is an acquired taste. Like a<BR>sushi orgasm, or LSD. Several people that I have turned <BR>on to this record, were unimpressed at first, only to <BR>fall in love with it later. If you like the same old common,<BR>derivative, unimaginative, over-produced, superstar crap, <BR>then this record is not for you. The cadence of the guitar <BR>lines in Venus De Milo are so beautiful, they will give you<BR>chills. In the crescendo of the title track, Verlaine makes <BR>his guitar sound like sea gulls. Elevation is taught, edgy, <BR>and dripping with as much mood as a song can possibly be made<BR>to hold. Some people do not respond to the herky-jerkiness<BR>of Verlaines vocals, but they are well suited to the material.<BR>The album has a bit of european flavor. Actually, one has to<BR>describe this album in broad strokes, because there is no <BR>artist that make sense to compare them to. Television blaze<BR>their own trail. Marquee Moon is honestly and truly a classic<BR>masterpiece, Television's jewel. The albums Adventure (2nd<BR>release), Television (3rd release), and several Verlaine solo<BR>albums, all have their moments, with an occasional great song,<BR>but they all seriously pale to Marquee Moon. It deserves a place<BR>in any desert island list. The true test, is that this record <BR>is as relevant and effecting today, as it was in 77.

B00005JM0B|3.0|In many ways, this movie reminded me a lot of Alien 3. After two smashing movies, the third fumbled to nowhere. Terminator 3 proves to be a weak movie because it had a weak story and it betrayed the original concept. After Terminator 2, the story should have basically ended, if not what was the purpose of that movie? If Judgment Day cannot be stop, only delayed, Skynet could have sent terminator after terminator to the past. The entire logic of the science fiction story would fall apart.<br />Second, this new bad terminator simply wasn't as powerful or nasty as the one in the second movie. Pretty girl but she bite the bullet pretty easily. Second, the director don't have James Cameron's touch for action and story telling all at the same time. He can only do one thing at a time and its showed.<br />Bad film editing in the movie. After all, how did that RV crew managed to get into the top secret Skynet Center just at the same time as the bad terminator got in. At least the bad terminator can disguised herself as anyone, how can John Conner and his buddies get in that easily of entrance??<br />If this was a stand alone movie, it would have been more enjoyable but as part of the series, it definitely fail to deliever and while everything about the film was technically well done, it totally failed in the most important aspect of any science fiction movie, the story!!
0060005424|5.0|this is the sort of book that pulls you in and keeps holding on until the end.  luckily, there is another book that comes after lirael.  i would hate to read this book without its sequel!  but you will enjoy this book in a major way.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|&quot;Big In Japan&quot; is the rock 'n' roll cliché. Late last year, Rush found out, much to their surprise, that they were Big In Brazil. The Vapor Trails tour was already a historic and important one for Rush:  their first tour in almost six years, the band had managed to get back together and record and tour behind a new album. Coming on the heels of multiple tragedies in drummer Neil Peart's personal life, the future existence of the band was even in doubt for a while. The ensuing tour was a triumphant return, with the band playing songs that many Rush fans thought they would never get to hear live. Unaware of their vast Brazilian popularity, and having never played there, Rush dropped into Brazil for three shows after the apparent end of their tour had already passed. They ended up playing to their three largest audiences ever -- a screaming, adoring throng of Brazilians. <br />Indeed, these people are so into it that it would be a travesty to leave the sound of them off of the album:  they sing along to every song, something that just doesn't happen at Rush concerts. The fact that they know every word to the new Rush songs and even sing along to the instrumentals -- yes! -- shames American and Canadian audiences. Clearly feeding off of the crowd, Rush turns in a monumental performance. The three musicians, always among the very best in rock, all turn in fine performances here. Especially notable is guitarist Alex Lifeson, who all-too-often falls in the shadows of his two virtuoustic band mates:  he turns in an absolutely scorching performance here, unleashing solo after monstrous solo.<br />The track selection is quite good, ranging across their entire career -- from Working Man to One Little Victory -- though the 80's onward are best represented. It is a joy to hear that many of these 80's songs still hold up. The various 90's songs that are here, many of which were also included on Different Stages, all feature better performances than on that album. The Vapor Trails songs, of which there are a generous amount here, also come alive in concert. Many Rush fans, including this reviewer, were disappointed in that album, with its claustrophobic sound and half-hearted production. These live renditions prove that the fault was not in the songs:  sounding vibrant and full of life, they earn their rightful place in the Rush canon on this album. The true standout tracks on the album are an absolutely menacing version of 2112 Overture/The Temples of Syrinx -- the meanest version of the song ever recorded; a great Leave That Thing Alone which segues into Peart's excellent and re-tooled drum solo; and most of the last disc, which includes an excellent La Villa Strangiato, punctuated by Lifeson's hilarious monologue. Last, but not least, is the closing medley of By-Tor and the Snow Dog/Cygnus X-1/Working Man, on which the trio awesomely displays the full extent of their musicianship. This virtuositic jam is a fitting close to the album -- and what a joy to hear Rush perform Working Man again! Also included are two &quot;board bootlegs&quot; from previous concerts, excellent performances of the rarely-heard Vital Signs and Between Sun &amp; Moon.<br />As for the album's controversial sound, rest assured:  reports of its ineptitude have been greatly exaggerated. To be sure, the sound is not as good as Different Stages, perhaps the best-sounding live album this reviewer has ever heard. At time, the vocals are somewhat difficult to hear (this problem is basically fixed a few songs into the set -- understandable, as there was no soundcheck) and the instruments are not always evenly-differentiated. But these are minor problems. Rush In Rio sounds like what it is:  a live album:  it sounds live, and the crowd is intact. It really makes the listener feel as if he or she was there.<br />Rush normally releases a live album after every 4 studio albums. This release, coming after only one studio album and hot on the heels, comparatively, of the last live effort, is definitely a fans-only affair. But what an affair it is:  a great setlist which includes many songs -- The Pass being one -- that Rush fans haven't heard live in a very long time. So, fans only -- but that's all who's buying Rush albums in 2003, anyway.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I bought this cd on a friend's recomendation and since that day I have worshipped at the temple of volta.  You can feel the passion in every song, everything they do is 100% to the limit.  It is also refreshing to hear something so experimental in a time when most of what is on the radio is referred to as &quot;manufactured music&quot;.  This is definitely art rock, when the majority of the tracks on the cd are over 5 minutes and include jaw on the floor amazing solos, it makes it obvious that The Mars Volta is unlike anything else out there.<br />If you buy this cd though, I most warn you, you will want to have a recent picture of your face handy so that your friends will remember what you looked like when they are re-assembling you after you are blown away by this disc.  It really is that impressive/refreshing/awesome.<br />It was for me anyway.  Then I saw them live and it took the amazement (is that a word?) to a whole new level.  You should definitely pick this up if you think you like music at all.
B000001ELP|2.0|This is a bad record.  It isn't because the producer Ezrin did a shoddy job or that it's the third change of directions in three years, or because Frehley had limited input into it's creation, or even because it takes the form of a progressive rock album.  It's bad, because, it's a BAD progressive rock album.  And that's bad.  If your going to venture into the realm of the prog-rock concept album, you better have brought your chops, a healthy dose of musical knowledge and the high point of your career's creativity.  Kiss left two of those things somewhere in the mid-seventies, and for the musical know-how, they never had it.  The storyline is not discernible and the bridging lacks continuity.  In fact, there isn't any continuity.  OK...between 'Only You' and 'Under the Rose' is good.  But that's it.  'Just a Boy' sounds like a really bad knockoff of the Who's It's a Boy, off the rock opera Tommy (which also happens to be the leadoff cut after an overture).  The song Odyssey is miserable and shouldn't even have been here, as it wasn't penned by Kiss.  Why hire the services of someone else if they can't even contribute on your level?  Don't get it.  Not prudent.  This must have been a real rushed job.  'Dark Light' and 'I' are also stinkers.<br />If Kiss had tried to pull this off in '75, or began their tenure with this intended direction, there's no doubt in my mind that they would be successful at it. They're amazingly talented and focused songwriters. But, they didn't develop in that direction.  They became the biggest groove-driven, big guitar, Pop-Rock outfits of the 70's.  This album fails because Prog-Rock just ain't Kiss' cup of tea.  It also fails because it's attempted at a low point in Kiss creativity and camaraderie.  The band isn't at harmony and it reflects in this disjointed effort.  Simmons carries the entire project.  His input is strong.  The tracks 'Only You', 'Under the Rose', 'A World Without Heroes' are the best on the disc.  The title track alsohappens to kick ass.  Well, you say, he just cited 4 solid tracks, it has to be a fairly good album.  No, it's not.  It aspires to be a progressive concept piece, and a whole bunch of other criteria applies to that.  In that realm, it's all about atmospherics and intensity; either emotionally or sonically.   <br />If you want great Kiss patented music, go with the first one, 'Love Gun' or 'Hotter than Hell'.  You want quality experimentation, I would suggest 'Creatures of the Night' or 'Dynasty'.  A big F up to the 80's girlie-rock sound.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Yes, I'm a Hardcore Britney fan who is in her 30s. I love this CD. It's especially great for fans of dance music. Those who didn't like Britney before, may be singing a different tune after listening to this album. Soon she will surpass Madonna.
B000001GQQ|1.0|Miss Argerich remains one of the most dreadful of current pianists.  Her playing is cliched, affected and strident.  She represents the perfect postmodern classical musician;  Interpretations which convey a contempt for the audience by virtue of its obtuseness and meaningless &quot;musicality&quot;, all style and no substance.  No wonder the vast majority of the public detest classical music.  Classical music and performers, like literature of the past 50 years has lost its relationship to the public and any real human sensibility.  I was an undergraduate piano major but opted for medicine because of the bizarre aesthetic that seemed to be in vogue today.  I would rather listen to rap music, at least it has some originality and is trying to communicate something.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Bottom line: You don't buy Dream Theater CDs for a three-minute pop tune that you'll hear every hour on the radio.  You want to hear their exceptional talents.  You get that on this CD.  I'm baffled by some of the previous reviews: How can you listen to anything one time and know instantly if you like it or not?  You can't.  Give it a few listens.  There's a lot going on in the songs.  I hear some &quot;Awake&quot; in some of the songs.  I hear some &quot;6DOIT&quot; in some songs.  I hear stuff I haven't heard before.  I had to laugh when I read they sold out on this, as if corporate radio is demanding 10 minute long songs.  Dream Theater is putting out music they want to create; they're not trying to go commercial.  If they wanted to, I'm sure they could.  I just think they'd be incredibly bored.  It's not SFAM (at least, not yet).  And, the preponderance of the 7-string power chords gets tiresome.  Other than that, I'm enjoying it the more I listen to it.
B000127LW2|5.0|I live in Salt Lake City, and since Voyager was pulled off the air here a few months ago have really missed the show! I am so glad to know the series is coming out on DVD. I have been a huge Star Trek fan for years, and think Voyager is the best S.T. series yet. If you are a Star Trek fan, spend the money, and get this series...I have converted 2 TNG fans over to Voyager. Hopefully you will be next!<br />I think it would be great if Paremount would do a TNG/Voyager movie with the focus being on the Voyager crew.

I loved it 'cause it helped me improve my guitar skills and I enjoyed practicing because I love Springsteen's songs..... His work is known to be excellent and this book just goes to prove it.......<br />I think it's a great gift for anybody who plays the guitar (even if you don't master the instrument, this book could actually help you)!!!
B000089RVR|5.0|Well where do i start. Before 'White Flag' i didn't really listen to dido's music,since then i have gone into a frenzy.I brought the life for rent album first i was dissapointed at first but i listened at night to it for about a week.Iloved it i all the tracks had there own little meaning and they didn't sound like they had been thrown in just make up the album. Dido's music is amazing with a unique voice.I then brought 'No Angel' and thought that it had more charactor than 'life for rent' but 'life for rent;get played more often in my house and i think its a credit to Dido and must be listend to over and over again to becuase you hear somthing differnt each time you listent to each track.Fantastic worth every penny hours of enjoyment and proberly will still be listening to it year to come.<br />Fave songs on album (i love them all)<BR>Stonned<BR>life for rent<BR>see you when your 40<BR>see the sun <BR>and <BR>sand in my shoes<br />i recommend her website  [...] :)
B0000DJZA5|5.0|There seems to be some awfully strong opinions one way or the other on the stripped-down reissue of this enigmatic album. Here's my take: I bought the album back in the day when it was issued solely because I was in the habit of buying every Beatles album. I only sort of liked it back then, my favorites being Two Of Us and The Long and Winding Road. I didn't like the commercial and overplayed Get Back, and was sick of hearing the very overplayed title cut every time I turned on the radio. So, I didn't listen to it often and didn't give the rest of the album much attention. For that matter, the LP has been mouldering on the shelf since the 70s.<BR>I bought the stripped-down version recently only because I was curious to see what it sounded like without the schmaltzy orchestration. And do you know what? I like it a great deal. After it arrived in the mail, I threw it in the CD player and let it run through three times, discovering that though I can still do without the title cut and Get Back, the rest of the songs are more than good enough to bring this record a five star rating.<BR>So instead of folks ranting about the merits of the Spector production versus the new one, each should put on his or her own favorite recording of Let It Be and let it rest.
0553288105|5.0|The good doctor, over his lifetime, wrote more books than many people read in their lifetimes. Many were excellent explanations of various aspects of science written in language that a layman could understand. Some were good analyses of literature, such as Shakespeare and the Bible. But it is his science fiction works, from his vision of a Foundation to Robots imbued with Three Laws, that guarantee him a place in the hearts of fans of the genre, and a fame that spreads well beyond its boundaries.<br /><br />This book was something of a departure for him, not being related to any of his other SF works, but still shows his sure hand at plotting and his deft melding of real science with a literally out-of-this-world idea. The story is told in three completely different segments, related only by the commonality of the scientific idea that drives this book, the Electron Pump, a device that can, apparently, deliver infinite free energy by trading material with a universe that operates on slightly different physical laws than our own.<br /><br />The first segment is a beautiful glimpse into the sometimes not-so-nice world of the academic researcher, into who gets credit (not necessarily the deserving one) for an idea, how animosities begin and are nurtured, about the crassness of public policy being determined by those who do not and cannot understand the basics of the science that delivers the technological goodies.<br /><br />The second segment is the part that makes this book deserving of its Hugo Award.  Shifting from our universe to the para-universe that initiated the transfer that began the Electron Pump, Asimov invents a truly alien race that is at once believable and violently different from our own.  Here we meet Odeen, Tritt, and Dua, who each form one part of tri-sexed whole. Each of these beings becomes a real person, from Tritt, the stolid, stubborn parent, Odeen as the absent minded thinker, and most especially Dua as the feeling, capricious, different one. Part of what makes this section so seductive is that Asimov has not just stated that this was tri-sexed species, but shows just how such an arrangement could work, and then throws in something I don't think I saw elsewhere till some of Ursala K. LeGuin's stories - just what constitutes the no-no's, the 'dirty' aspects of their sex lives. And these aspects, when viewed in terms of the whole life cycle of this species, make sense! A truly remarkable achievement, and I wish he had written more about this remarkable universe and its inhabitants.<br /><br />The third section returns to our universe, and deals with how free investigation into reality guided by leaps of intuition can overcome even two separate hide-bound organizations, and naturally leads to the resolution of the problems introduced in the earlier sections. This section is not quite as strong as the other two, but does definitely develop one of Asimov's points: the characteristics of the universe we live in are determined by several seemingly random constants, from the strength of quark-quark interactions to the speed of light, and changing any of them would result in very radically different universes.<br /><br />A strong novel, with some excellent characterization within each section, and based on a solid bedrock of real science. This is possibly the best stand-alone fiction work that he wrote, and should be placed on your shelves right next the Foundation and Robot series.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)section so seductive is that Asimov has not just stated that this was tri-sexed species, but shows just how such an arrangement could work, and then throws in something I don't think I saw elsewhere till some of Ursala K.

B000089RVX|5.0|I personally think this is a very amazing album.  The songs do seem very similar (partly because Amy Lee's belting range is only so large), but if you really listen to them you find that there is actually huge variety (within the genre, of course).  Her belting makes the vocals utterly powerful thanks to her strong and beautiful voice, though.  The heavily distorted guitars sound thick and fit the mood perfectly as they play catchy and powerful riffs.<br />What attracted me to this album, in addition to the above listed reasons, is the emotional depth of the music.  Perfect for angry or angsty moods, the music follows my less-than-perfect emotions perfectly.  They do an amazing job of creating moods, from the raw desperation of Tourniquet to the sadness of Hello to the thought-inspiring Imaginary.<br />At first, the album does seem very repetetive, but once you listen a few times you hear the subtleties and the feelings behind the music.  It's an amazing album, and I've always got it with me.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Six years later and I still listen to several tracks regularly.  Paranoid Android and No Surprises especially.<br />Good album with some great songs.  One of five to bring with you if stranded somewhere. :)
B0000C8AVR|3.0|Bob Dylan is definitely influential in the world of music.  I know a lot of people that listen to him everyday.  His voice can be a little grating, but if you listen to his words, they can really say something.  This album is really good lyrically.  But the recording quality is a joke.  Too bad because it would've gotten a 5 star if it wasn't so bad.
B00008AY3L|1.0|Someone once told me that Gary Busey and Nick Nolte were Siamese twins separated at birth by this Diamonds on the Inside album.  My rebuttal was that Jason Mraz, Ben Harper and Jack Johnston were all the readheaded surfer under the blanket in the movie &quot;Point Break&quot;; Diamonds on the Inside split that one surfer into three horribly similar musicians, each of which came to be from a stitch of Dave Mathew's hair that Gary Busey had brought back to the police lab.  Even more interesting, that same person argued that All of Anthony Keatis's talent resided in the center of his foot and when his foot was shot in the movie Point Break, all his talent went right through the floorboard and ended up back at the beach, next to Dave Mathews follicles.
B00005JMFR|2.0|If I recall from the original \\"Matrix\\"  Morpheaus tells Neo that the \\"One\\" would bring the end of the war and the destruction of the Matrix.  However, by the end of \\"Revolution$\\" the Matrix is still in existence.  Was Morpheaus wrong?  Was Neo really the one?  Upon watching the original \\"Matrix\\" again many glaring inconsistencies emerge.  While the ending of \\"Revolutions\\" was interesting it was too loaded with philosophical claptrap.  Ultimately, the Matrix became the fish that eat its own tail.  The guaranteed audience for this dribble made these movies critic proof.  People flocked to see the film, as did I, only to realize that it was no more than a subtle money grab by the studio to exploit the desire of film goers to recapture the magic of the original.
B00008NG5V|1.0|Jack Johnson music is custom designed for music fans uninterested in anything unusual, creative, agressive, or interesting.  The Horizon Has Been Defeated reminds me of a Sublime song that Bradley got halfway through and said screw it and took a nap instead.  The rest is all horribly similar, like everyone's sorta just mindlessly at a practice session in the recording studio.  Jack Johnson lacks anything that makes me wanna be happy.
B000002HMH|5.0|Im just gonna say that Load has got to be some of the best work metallica has ever down. Yes its different, but please, is different allways bad?

I myself prefer the technical work of And Justice For All, like that Quinton Cockhead character, but face it, in the 80's not all their stuff was thrash<BR>Kill Em All-I would summarize as an agressive hardcore punk style, which i kinda wished they would have pursued that a little bit more, before starting the whole thrash thing<BR>Ride the Lightning-Started the thrash era, this album defined what all you thrash heads love, and yet u don't give any credit to it, its all about Master of Puppets, which is just a another Ride the Lightning 2 years later<BR>And Justice For All-a classic technical masterpiece, still keeps to the metallica speed metal, but at the same time this album opens the doors for a better metallica<BR>Black Album-secured metallica's throne for the greatest heavy metal band ever<BR>Load-masterred what the black album was moving toward<BR>Re-Load-another load, all in all i just look at both albums as a one long awesome rock album<BR>St. Anger-a new approach, not as great as Load and reload, or justice. the album does show that metallica is not afraid of trying new directions, and if you realized anything, these guys were only trying to appease all.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album puts this group into the mainstream, each new single release is great. The album rocks from one track to the next adn the flow from each song is uniterupted. This group is worth all the hype in the world, awesome!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Though it was never given a fair chance by the network who aired it (FOX), Firefly was one of the most orginal programs I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. It had fantastic writing, by arguably one of the most creative minds in television today, Joss Whedon, and his brilliant staff of writers. The cast was one of the best groups of actors ever gathered, each bringing a beautiful facet to the show. Each episode is not only fun to watch the first time, but they all have high re-watch value, a trait severly lacking in todays reality plagued television world. Buy this dvd set now, you will not be dissapointed.<BR>One of the best Sci-fi series ever!<BR>Keep Flyin'!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Having lived through the rise and fall of the Beatles, it is always nice to listen to the lads making music. Listen to this album, or CD if you will, to hear them not at their peak,  but just being what they were in their hearts, a rock and roll combo. Everything else that The Beatles conjurs up of pop culture and musical genius doesn't count for anything on this CD.. It is John, Paul, George and Ringo being human and fallable, and therefore, approachable.
B00008AWOD|2.0|Sleeping is exactly what the album makes me feel like. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE the previous three albums - but I found this latest offering to be quite boring.<BR>My fav songs (and the only ones I really like from the album) are This Picture, The Bitter End, and Special Needs.<br />Also, the audio quality sounds absolutely horrible - VERY muffled and muddy sounding.  With better quality I would have added another star.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|If I were definitely in the Zone, I would've give it 5 stars. I borrowed the album from a friend of mine and I listened to it in it's entirety!! Finally!! You know what? I love the album. Here is a short review for every song.<br />1) Me Against the Music - 5/5 - Song for people who turn to music to just dance and forget problems for a while.<BR>2) (I Got That) Boom Boom - 5/5 - Party animal<BR>3) Showdown - 5/5 - Song for a night of private party.<BR>4) Breathe On Me - 6/5 My favorite song on the whole album.<BR>5) Early Mornin' - 5/5 Love The Beat. Song for a private party, too.<BR>6) Toxic - 5/5 - Song to tell your lover how good he or she is and how fantastic he or she is.<BR>7) Outrageous - 0/5 - Hate it! Only song I don't like on the album<BR>8) Touch Of My Hand - 5/5 - Excellent beat. Song for people who love themselves and are not ashamed of it.<BR>9) The Hook Up - 5/5 - Great song. I love it. Nothing like Beyonce's &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, like some people have said.<BR>10) Shadow - 4/5 - Good song, great lyrics, but don't like the beat too much.<BR>11) Everytime - 5/5 - Great sad song. Made me cry the first time I listened to it.<BR>12) Me Against the Music Mix 5/5 - Just as good as the original.<br />Bottom Line = &quot;Outrageous&quot; is the only song I gave the album four stars for, but all of the other tracks are great. Didn't like it at first, but now I like it a lot.
B00005JM02|5.0|Should I heap another praise on this masterpiece?  Why not?  Everyone should know that Pixar never gets it wrong, and, yes, they prove it again!  &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is entertaining, unpredictable, and most of all, very touching picture.  <br />The story involves a father and son -- only that they are fish.  Nemo is the only son of Marlin, a good-natured but slightly nervous clownfish who always worries about his beloved son, but too much worry makes Nemo rather uncomfortable in his school.  Actually, on the first day, the father and son have an argument about Marlin's over-protecting attitude.<br />But when Nemo is captured by a human, and is taken away from the world Marlin belongs to, the desperate father takes chance to do whatever he must do.  But unlucky Marlin, the only help he can get is a scatterbrained fish Dory, whose memory last only ... er ... 5 seconds.<br />The rest of the film you don't need any more explanations.  The delightful adventures of Nemo (trying to escape from a tank) and Marlin (trying to locate Nemo) is shown one after the other.  Maybe this way of storytelling somehow deprives the plot of the smooth flow of character change seen in, say, &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot;  However, the well-scripted film keeps on going, with its unpredictable turns given from interesting supports (including sharks attending some &quot;meeting&quot;), and as the film reaches the ending, it certainly moves your heart, possibly to tears.<br />We must give voice actors due praise.  You never forget the great vocal performance of the pair Albert Brooks as Marlin, and Ellen DeGeneres as Dory.  They deserve some awards, giving the CGI-created fishes the real life.  Possibly, these fishes are better actors than some Hollywood starlets.  And the CGIs are perfect, expressing the delicate movements of water, and slight shades of ever-changing colors in the south sea.<br />In short, don't miss it.  The fact that it is an animation should not discourage adults from viewing it.  It is great.  It is terrific.  And it has a heart.  And a big one too.<br />Don't forget to see the end of the film, in which you get the most uproarious gag in the film.  And one guest character from &quot;Monster Inc&quot; too.
B00005A46T|1.0|Firstly, Slipknot is nu-metal. Secondly, do you wish to be seen listening to possibly the most idiotic, ignorant, pathetic and dumbest band of all time? Look at their lyrics - I am fourteen years old, and I can do much, much better than them. It makes me sad that there are people out there this dumb. They are truly destroying the whole metal scene, and emancipating the true metal bands from having any success. Let's face it: Slipknot are making people dumber than ever.<br />As for the music, it is tired, boring, pathetic and technically rubbish. I swear, I could write better music even though I just started learning the guitar. Slipknot is not talented, nor are they forcing you to think intellectually. If you would like to expand to beautiful works of art, listen to Dream Theater, Tool, Opeth, A Perfect Circle, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames and the old Metallica. This is good, intelligent music; unlike Slipknot. Please free your mind from this pathetic band, whose main purpose is to get rich quick, not create music for the sake of adding something of quality of the world. It's bands like Slipknot, with their &quot;hard&quot; attitude of putting masks on and singing about death which bands TRUE metal bands such a bad sterotype.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles are the greatest band in history, and will probably remain to be. Don't get me wrong, there are other magnificant ones like Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, Sublime, etc. They all deserve credit, but not as much as the Beatles. There's so much to say about them that it would take too long. So let me just say this once again: The Beatles are the greatest band in history, and that's all there is to it.
B00000K3D4|5.0|The Labrynth is a movie full of fantasy and wonder, suspense and joy, a movie that is worth watching over and over again.  The puppets have such character, and add a great deal of humor to the movie, the actors are great, I am not a big fan of David Bowie, but I have to admit, he did a great job as the goblin king, the movie as a whole was a fantasy that you just think could never happen, while huddling under the covers at night hoping the goblins don't try to take you, it makes you wonder if maybe something like this really could happen...all in all Labrynth is a wonderful fantasy addition to anyone's home DVD or VHS collection
B0000931QR|5.0|You have been depraived of great music if you haven't heard this 3rd album by La Oreja de Van Gogh. This hit band from San Sebastian, Spain, led by the beautiful vocals of Amaia Montero, once again show us their capability of amazing music. There are beautiful ballads on this album such as, &quot;Rosas&quot; and &quot;Nadie Como Tu&quot;. There are also great pop-rock tunes such the album opener &quot;Puedes Contar Conmigo&quot;, &quot;Adios&quot;, and &quot;Geografia&quot;. There is also a great bonus dance track, which is a first for La Oreja. Though this album may appear to be only about love, La Oreja de Van Gogh discusses more serious issues. In my personal favorite song &quot;Un Mundo Mejor&quot; La Oreja de Van Gogh sings about the growing poverty in Havana, Cuba. <br />This album not only has great music and beautiful vocals, but it also has intensely profound lyrics. I consider this to be an album that makes you think about how important and significant the little things in life are. <br />&quot;Lo Que Te Conte Mientras Te Hacias La Dormida&quot; is definately an album that is worth every penny. The creativity of this album is just as unique as the band's name.

0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is an &quot;intelligent thriller&quot; in every sense of the term. Not only is this an intense tale of murder and mystery, but is an art history lesson, a conspiracy theory and an eye-opening provocation all in one. That's not to mention that the characters are very well-developed, interesting and mostly charming and likable. This is a fiction story, but major parts of the book are based on facts that I had never been aware of until now.<br />The novel opens up at the scene of a murder taking place. The characters and events surrounding the murder are suspicious and uncertain. Over the next few chapters, the pieces start falling into place slowly but surely. You learn that the murdered man, Jacques Sauni&egrave;re was the curator of the Lourve in Paris, France. He was also the Grand Master of a secret society known as the Priory of Sion. This mysterious organization has had the mission of protecting the secrets of the Holy Grail, and members of the society have included such prominent figures as Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo and... Leonardo Da Vinci.<br />The first few chapters also reveal that 3 other murders had taken place on the same night, all 3 victims being other members of the Priory of Sion. The killer is an albino monk named Silas, a member of a sect of the Catholic Church called Opus Dei, working for a Catholic Bishop, Manuel Aringarosa. Both collaborators are working for a mysterious man who calls himself The Teacher and has revealed his identity to no one.<br />Robert Langdon is an American visitor in Paris, as well as a Professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard University, in town for a lecture. Langdon had been scheduled to meet with Sauni&egrave;re on the night of the murder, and yet Sauni&egrave;re had not shown up (obviously). Langdon is summoned to the murder scene by the French police captain Bezu Fache under the guise of needing Langdon's expertise. Before Sauni&egrave;re died, he had locked himself in a section of the Lourve and left several clues that suggested that Langdon might able to help the police determine who had killed him and what the motive might have been. However, it isn't Langdon's expertise that was the sole reason for bringing him to the scene of the crime. Langdon is Fache's primary suspect. Before he can be arrested, Langdon is unexplainably rescued by a cryptologist named Sophie Neveu who believes Langdon is innocent... And then all Hell really breaks lose as both of them become fugitives from the law while trying to decipher the clues left by Sauni&egrave;re to determine who the killer really was and why he did it.<br />The clues Sauni&egrave;re left are nothing short of genius. What's even more brilliant is how Dan Brown is able to intertwine facts and conspiracy theories while coming up with double meanings and applying them to the story line. Most of Sauni&egrave;re's clues are left in the form of codes and symbols, most of which could be found and traced through &quot;pagan&quot; symbols embedded in the paintings of Leonardo Da Vinci, as well as Da Vinci's history, lifestyle and beliefs. There were several moments while reading this book when I had to jump up and run to the internet so I could call up pictures of Da Vinci's paintings, as well as his biographies, so I could see if the symbolism and relationships described in the book were founded... and they are. I was completely and totally astonished and blown away by how much I was able to learn and ponder about Da Vinci from reading this book. I am so inspired in fact, that now I want to get my hands on anything I can learn about the man.<br />The Da Vinci Code is a smooth book to read. The chapters are extremely short, which makes it convenient to find stopping points - not that you'll want to stop (this book is so engulfing). The flow of the story is really easy to follow, even though it often splits up, switching from scene to scene. Brown is masterful at telling the story from one viewpoint,and then switching and telling it from the eyes of a different character.<br />I cannot give this book enough praise. Not only is it chocked full of information guaranteed to spark the imagination of the conspiracy theorist in anyone, but it is so complex, with intense and unexpected twists and turns all the way until the end. You will be guessing and trying to crack The Da Vinci Code the whole time. What's best, is that the person behind it all, is the one person I would have never even suspected, not even for a moment - and yet it makes perfect sense. I am blown away.<br />The Da Vinci Code is one of the most intoxicating, cinematic, thought-provoking books I've ever read. I highly recommend it to those who enjoy a good murder mystery and conspiracy theory, as well as to those who are interested in religious symbolism and are fans of Leonardo Da Vinci. In order to appreciate the brilliant complexity of this story, you simply MUST get your copy and start reading it today! A Must-Read!!!

B0000DD7LB|1.0|I have never posted a review before, but I had to with this one. I like Britney Spears in general, but this latest CD was a real dissapointment. Very &quot;clubby&quot;, which is fine, but it gets monotonous. She has no range or self expression on this CD. It's the kind of music that is boringly generic and blasted at cheesy clubs just to get people to gyrate. Nothing special and extremely tedious, every song sounds the same. Same tempo. Same octive range. Her voice is devoured by the backround vocals (which are just as monotonous.) Whispering and moaning seem to have become her latest skill. I think she needs to stop partying and start working on something that matters.
B000002AS3|5.0|This album is definitely the best album by Oasis, and maybe the one of the best albums of the 90's. Each and every song on the album is unforgettable, and a handful are all time classics. The weakest song is probably 'Up in The Sky', which would get a 5 or 6 on 10, while virtually the whole album gets 10, with the exception of Slide Away, which gets an 8. The best songs are 'Columbia', 'Rock 'N Roll Star' and 'Married With Children'. No gripes, and no regrets. This one will be hard to get of the head, once in. Or in Noel's words, 'the uninvited guest who stays till the end'<br />A must buy for music lovers.
0316666343|4.0|Good book, definitely worth reading. This books seems almost poetic in a way, i like Alice Sebold's way of writing. Anyway, good book, i would recomend it.
B00005JMCW|4.0|When i first came to notice this I thought this film was a chick flick. I'm a guy and I don't really care that much about family-oriented films, but I got to say this is GOOD! There I said it. I saw this filme with my mom and we enjoyed it. The basic plotline of this remake of the original has Mom(Jamie Lee Curtis) and daughter switching bodies for a day. Mom is hard-working and quick-witted woman and her daughter is a rebellious and uptight girl who plays in a rock band. Same plot as the original, but different backgrounds for the characters. It works well. I liked the psychical work from the characters. Curtis, from the body of the teenager, dresses hip in order to in with the crowd and the daughter's crush is falling for her! Curtis and the young actress Linsay Lohan give heartwarming performances and make the believibility of a real life mother and daughter seem real. The only slight negative thing about this film is the subplot of the fortune cookie being the basis of the mom and daughter's switch. Otherwise the film is a standout.
6304712499|4.0|I came to this movie knowing basically nothing about the Spawn character, the comic strip, and the whole story behind Todd McFarlane's vaunted modern-day hero.  I am familiar with McFarlane's work on Spiderman in the early nineties, but that's basically it.  My reaction may thus be much different from devoted Spawn fans who had definite expectations from this film.  Fans are apt to either love or hate the real-life movie dramatization of a favorite character, and this movie had definite limits that could easily rub fans the wrong way.  I understand that there are some significant differences between the Spawn storyline we see here and that of the comic book series, that this is a much more linear retelling of the legend, one that could not afford to leave many unanswered questions at the end because the chances of making a sequel were unquantifiable at the time.  The special effects are not bad at all, but the movie suffers from the overinflated billing of these special effects; if the studio hadn't overplayed their hand by naming this &quot;the special-effects movie of the year&quot; 1997, all of the computer animation would have been scrutinized less completely by moviegoers.  The limitations imposed by the MPA ratings board in securing the film a PG-13 rating also basically ruined the film that was shown in theatres; this &quot;director's cut&quot; of the film is a complete and much, much better version than fans originally paid to see.  <br />Spawn, for those who don't know, is not your typical superhero.  Trained to be an elite assassin for the CIA, he ultimately decides to get out after a mission that kills a lot of civilians who, he was promised, would not be in the area of operations.  His boss, played quite wickedly by Martin Sheen, basically sets him up and has him killed.  Al Simmons, our hero's real name, goes from being burned alive to the always-flaming pits of hell, where he agrees to lead the devil's army in return for getting his wife back.  While no time has passed for him personally, five whole years have come and gone back on earth, his wife is married to his best friend, he's horribly burned and disfigured, a rude and crude Clown keeps pestering him, and some old guy in a long coat keeps giving him the business about taking the wrong path.  John Leguizamo is brilliant as Clown, the devil's representative on earth who has a hilarious yet nasty nature to match his dramatically strange appearance.  It is his job to make sure Simmons, now being reborn as Spawn, acts according to plan and starts Armageddon as scheduled.  Spawn isn't happy at all, despite the painfully new amazing armor his body begins to grow, and he lashes out in anger at the man he blames for his death. There is still a lot of Al Simmons underneath the scars and living armor, however, and the ultimate test will find him choosing whether to accede to the devil's plans or betray his evil covenant and become a dark angel for good in the world.  <br />There are a lot, and I do mean a lot of CGI effects in this movie.  Most of them are quite good, but as a whole the effects do not live up to their over hyped billing.  The scenes taking place in the pits of hell, in a sense thrown in during the final stages of production, do not look very real at all; in truth, they look like the kind of animated sequence you might find in the computers games Doom or Diablo.  Spawn's living armor is capable of extraordinary things, as is his vintage red cape, but some of the effects are a tad rough around the edges and all of them look and feel cinematic rather than truly realistic.  As explained in the film's commentary, time and budgetary constraints explain the limits seen in this regard.  Don't expect to see the world's greatest CGI here, and you stand less chance of being disappointed.  The human side of this story is a compelling one, even though the film does not allow for the type of exposition found in the comic book series, I am sure.  Spawn truly is a new kind of hero, a hero created from the pits of hell itself.  For my money, though, the antics and unforgettable performance of John Leguizamo as Clown steal the show.<br />There are oodles of special features included on the DVD.  I made a point of listening to the commentary because I wanted to know more about Spawn's story, and it made for fascinating listening.  Featuring all of the men who basically created the movie, the most remarkable thing about the commentary is the list of all the cuts that had to be made in order to get a PG-13 rating for the film.  Many of these cuts are frankly ridiculous and show just how out of touch with reality the censors have become these days.  This theme is further expounded upon by Spawn creator Todd McFarlane in a series of fascinating interviews; you have to love the guy because he is anti-corporate to the core, fearlessly pointing out many of the problems with moviemaking today.  The making of featurette is good, the music videos are must-see (especially Marilyn Manson's), and there are loads of original sketches and illustrations that will be of interest to hard-core Spawn fans.
B0000AUHPK|1.0|This is a really, really terrible version of Bronte's classic book. It is absolutely sodden in film-making cliches, shot in a completely unimaginative way, poorly adapted, poorly cast, poorly acted, and extremely poorly directed. The adaption makes a mockery of the fantastic language of the book by making it into a really overly dramatic cliche, with all the obvious things and extremes used. The casting is terrible - Fiennes does his best but is far too Shakespearian for Heathcliff, while Binoche, though a good actress, is a terrible choice for Cathy - with her French accent shining through, and her cute, totally un-wild nature. Also, the transition from children to adults in the film is a real jump and is totally unrealistic - they look about 35 when they are meant to be 15. I watched this with 10 other people who had all read the book and we all just laughed all the way through, because it is such a terrible film and so utterly cliched in the delivery of the lines, in the use of special effects, and so forth. This really is bad - avoid.
6300184064|5.0|I just want to point out that this movie is set at Christmastime, ending (apparently) on Christmas morning. This is important to the story, as it provides a forceful contrast to the bleak world of commerce and despotism which actually exists. Brazil is required holiday viewing!
B00005JKG9|4.0|Melding 'Death of a Salesman' with 'Taxi Driver' and Mamet's own distinctive writing, this is a truly brilliant movie with a fantastic cast and a brilliant script. The text is really sharp and well-executed and challenging to the viewer, and we get top-notch performances across the board, particularly from Jack Lemmon, superb as Levine, the character most resembling Miller's Willy. This is somewhere in between Mamet's own arty, leftfield tendencies and a mainstream gritty urban movie and the combination works well, popularising Mamet's sometimes alinenating work. Top stuff.
B0000C1733|3.0|This is an anwser to the people who complain about the Zephyr Song not beeing on this album: get real. Many of the new &quot;fans&quot; know the Peppers only because of the Zephyr Song. But it's definitely not one of their best. Repetitive, cheap chords, weak solo (I wouldn't even call that a solo), that's how I would describe this song.  It didn't deserve to be on that album.
B00007ELEL|4.0|When my father went overseas he and a buddy would watch one movie over and over again~ The Big Lebowski. Now when I saw it the first time I really didn't understand it at all. I thought the language was vulgar and then I watched it again and again. This movie is hilarious. The Dude, Walter, and Donnie are some of the most interesting characters I have ever seen on the screen. Most of my male friends love the movie and actually relate to the movie. The movie is one that you can watch over and over again and still laugh, and you learn new things. It is extremely well written, acted, and directed. I would not suggest the movie to everybody but I would suggest it to most of my friends. The movie has wonderful dialogue that makes me laugh to this day. SO if you are looking for a different kind of comedy this one is for you.
B000002MG1|5.0|I have always loved R.E.M. but this by far is thier best album.  This album has and always will have a place in my heart.  The song writing is amazing and the production is timeless.  A real deep and emotional album that is dark but sweet from Drive to Find the River.  A masterpiece that I feel is over looked.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Daredevil may be one of the most accurate depictions of the comics-that's great, but you still need acting. The story left little to be desired, and by the end I was ready to run out of my friend's house, cursing Ben Affleck. The movie was dark-maybe some more uplifting shots would have brightened it up a bit. Unless you are a die-hard comic Daredevil fan, you won't like this movie very much.
B00005JLSE|5.0|While ruined by the boy next to me in French who can't seem to stop singing the songs, Chicago is a great movie with excellent songs and dancing. A little too racy for the kids, this makes a great party movie. Especially when everyone starts dancing uncontrollably.
B000089RVX|2.0|Evanescence has been over-exposed, over-played, and is now deemed under-talented. While the vocals are rich and harmonious, the songs are not truly original. I fear for the sophomore attempt.
B00009TB5G|5.0|While the other version of Two Towers is better for those who don't feel like sitting down for four hours, this version is more epic, more juice, more Smeagol (God that character gets on my nerves). The special features are astounding and very researched.
B00005JM02|5.0|While the beginning of the movie is sad, and melancholy is laced throughout the whole movie, Finding Nemo is a lovable piece of art your kids will love. With characters like the Turtle that reflects many of the guys at my surf-obsessed school, it's so cute.
B00005JKC3|4.0|While some didn't enjoy the deep intellectual discussions and the scientific background of this movie, I did, because this movie is worth it. The special effects are amazing. Jennifer Connelly was fantastic. I loved the costumes (I'm the Costume Master for my school's Drama department), and the whole movie was pieced together great. I didn't enjoy the comic book look, though. It was great, but more suited for something like The Flash, if they ever make a movie on him. The plot is also a little slow. The ending left a little to be desired, but it was a all-around good movie.
B00008H2LB|5.0|While some make fun of Linkin Park for sounding &quot;main-stream&quot;, others know that Linkin Park is the reason for &quot;main-stream rock&quot;. This CD is epic, for lack of a better word. The best songs were number 9, which took six years to come out and was well worth the wait, and 13, with the amazing singing. Chester's vocals improve considerably from the last album, catering to those who truly admire real talent.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This movie is perhaps better than the first, and leaves you wanting more. While it would have been nice to have characters like Archangel and Gambit, X-2 features the hottest mutants around. And I'm not talking about Hugh Jackman's impeccably strong upper body. I enjoyed the scene with Colossus in it, and the focus on the students, which we don't always get to see as much as we should. This movie is worth owning for the great plot and amazing special effects, as well as the great actors.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|With references to Wired and a hilarious subplot, The Italian Job won't keep you bored. Some call it a regular old movie. I'll call it a classic movie. The Italian Job has some hilarious actors, such as Seth Green. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a fun Friday night movie.
B00005JLYW|2.0|While the surfer theme was cute (and should have been used more), this movie sucks. Does every case these girls work on involve an emotional backplot? Why not something more like 007, and less like Austin Powers?
B0000508U6|2.0|I really wanted to like this record, having loved Coldplay's brilliant second CD, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head.&quot;  I've listened to it several times now, and one word keeps coming to mind: Soporific.<br />With the exception of &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Shiver,&quot; which are fine songs indeed, the rest of the album proceeds at a snail's pace.  I fail to see the similarities with Radiohead, whose dynamic and challenging records never sink into the torpor that ails &quot;Parachutes.&quot;  A closer comparison is with Travis' similarly moribund debut, &quot;The Man Who.&quot;<br />I like mellow artists (c.f. Richard Aschroft, Seal), but there's a fine line between mellow and mind-numbing.  Fortunately, Coldplay did learn how to mix things up a bit, and it shows on their next record.<br />I give &quot;Parachutes&quot; 2 stars for the two great songs (&quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Shiver&quot;) which are almost worth the price of admission alone.  (Great cover, too).
B00006AUIG|4.0|Session 9 is an example of a horror thriller. It has little in common with horror films like Jeepers Creepers where buckets of gore are used in place of imagination. Director Brad Anderson and his outstanding ensemble cast create a tension filled movie that has more in common with Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now  and Kubrick's The Shining than most contemporary horror thrillers. Perhaps that's the difference--this is a thriller not really a horror film. Although the film was shot on high definition 24 frame per second digital video, it's almost impossible to spot the difference on this DVD between that and film.<br />The Danvers Mental Hospital has been vacant since 1985. A 5 man crew from Hazman Elimination Company has made a low bid to clean out the place of asbestos tile and old insulation. In a bid to make their 1 week completion date, the owner of the company has arranged for a $10,000 bonus to be paid to all the crew if they can finish it within 7 days. Since it's really a two week job, these guys have their work cut out for them. It doesn't help that old ghosts loom large in the background and disturb their work. What they don't know can hurt them; evidently a multiple personality patient by the name of Mary was housed there. One of the reasons why the place was closed down was because of accusations from the doctors on staff and legal action they took. Budget cuts and a losing court case closed the sprawling Victorian style building down.<br />Led by a strong ensemble cast featuring David Caruso (CSI:Miami, NYPD Blue) and Josh Lucas (The Hulk, Sweet Home Alabama), Session 9 is an excellent example of what imagination and skill can accomplish without buckets of gore. The film isn't without flaws. The plotting becomes a bit lazy towards the conclusion but, on the whole, the film is an outstanding effort. Anderson does an excellent job in building considerable tension throughout the picture and the strong cast (actor Stephen Gevedon co-wrote the script with Anderson) only increases the tension and level of conflict between the characters.<br />The extras include an alternate ending, (which featured a dropped subplot that didn't quite mesh with the film) and deleted scenes. There's also an interesting commentary by the director (the film was actually shot at an old Mental Hospital so Anderson's comments are really interesting) as well as the theatrical trailer and a featurette on the mental hospital entitled The Haunted Palace. Never gruesome but always suspenseful, Session 9 is a great way to spend a chilly, rainy evening on a Friday night. Be warned, though that there is some bad langauge in the film so it isn't suitable for preteens.derson) only increases the tension and level of conflict between the characters.<br />The extras include an alternate ending, (which featured a dropped subplot that didn't quite mesh with the film) and deleted scenes.

B000127LW2|3.0|I'm very happy \\"Voyager\\" is finally coming to DVD.  Unlike \\"Enterprise\\" which started out decently and has amazingly gone downhill continuously (the characters are boring as heck) - \\"Voyager\\" started out weak and got much better over time.  The first season, the crew was mostly wet behind the ears, and Janeway still had a bun, really the show wasn't really worth watching until the third (and definetly the creative fourth) seasons.  Ultimately, \\"Voyager\\" ranks #3 behind DS9 and TNG as the best of the Treks to date, and the last four seasons were some of the best sci-fi television ever made.
B000001IPL|5.0|I'm a huge Offspring fan.  I have heard practically everything they have put out, and this album is by far the best one.  It contains classics like &quot;Bad Habit,&quot; &quot;Gotta Get Away,&quot; and &quot;Self Esteem,&quot; and has one of the best closing songs I have ever heard on a cd, &quot;Smash.&quot;  So if you're looking for some good surf-type punk music, this is where you should turn to.  Smash will do everything but disappoint you!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was no fan of Buffy et al, but my wife told me that Joss Weedon was coming out with a Sci-Fi show, so I gave it a chance. The first episode hooked me bad.  No Star Trek anything here.  Scummy, run-down, selfish renegades, insanity, good boys gone bad, and Animal Mother.  What more could you want?<br />As others have said, if you're reading this, you know the plot/premise, so I won't dwell on that too much.  The anti-utopian universe of this show, however, flies in the face of virtually all space-set television from the 1950's on.  Weedon combines paranoia about big government with piratical parasites, mixing in a dose of The X-Files and a hit of Blue Velvet just to make me shiver with halluncinatory delight.<br />Most sci-fi shows have been about maintaining the status quo, including all the white knights who pilot the UFP starships across re-run hell. Firefly is about running away from the culture, about a failed rebellion against a totalizing post-capitalist galaxy that offers citizens every advance, but brooks no individual eccentricity. The characters on Firefly have been flushed into the sewer of this Universe and they like it.<br />The utter nihilism of this show impressed me.  On the first episode, where the crew betray their smuggling operation to supply drugs to impoverished minors, the gangsters thugs come to menance them and one swears to hunt the crew to the ends of the universe.  Our captain kicks the thug into the turbo fan. I loved the show from that point on.<br />Sure, there were weak points, and the plots didn't always skirt the absolute edge all the time, but seeing a totally immoral, amoral, and vicious character like Adam Baldwin's play against the goody-goody doctor and his crazed sister was just fine with me.<br />Fox made a mistake cancelling this show. Why seven seasons of ST:TNG and not Firefly?  I guess on TV, only the nice guys finish first.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park is simply the best metal band out there now.  Meteora proves that they are going to continue to rock the metal world with crunching tunes like &quot;Don't Stay&quot; and &quot;Figure.09.&quot;  Even though everyone has heard the rap-metal combination before, Linkin Park is very original and can mix rap and metal together very well.  Meteora is a great album for any angry teenagers who are frusterated with their lifes or who just love metal and want to jump around.  Linkin Park is here to stay, and Meteora proves it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Ok, all the people that say this cd sucks and is not good are wrong. Every song on this album is great. The Hook-up, Showdown, and Outrageous are strong songs for her to move in to hip-hop and such. She also keeps her goos dance songs and pop songs. Possibly the best cd of 2003.
B00006JMQG|5.0|Filmed way back in 1921, &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; is perhaps one of the oldest horror films ever made. As a viewer, I see this film as a macabre, magnificent work of art. It was probably intended to be that way, since director Robert Wiene was heavily inspired by the German Expressionist movement. With its skewed and handpainted scenery, crooked angles, looming shadows, and ghostly aura, this feature film is an Edvard Munch painting brought to life. More importantly, its simple yet terrifying plotline helped give birth to early cinematic horror, which would forever place Lon Chaney, Bela Legosi, and Boris Karloff on pedestals. <BR>Here is the synopsis: A young man named Francis (Friedrich Feher) plays the narrator, opening his story at a carnival sideshow that opened in the town of Holstenwall. Francis and his best friend Alan (Hans Heinrich Von Twardowski) attended the show to witness a truly strange attraction: An aging scientist named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) unveils to an astounded audience a ghoulish sleepwalker named Cesare (Conrad Veidt), who the Doctor solely commands through the power of hypnotism. Under his control, Cesare awakens from his coffin-like box to prophesise people's fates. When an excited Alan asks Cesare, &quot;How long shall I live?&quot; he grimly utters, &quot;The time is short. You die at dawn!&quot; Meanwhile, the town police investigate a string of bizarre murders. Not surprisingly, Alan would end up becoming the killer's next victim!<br />Devastated by the sudden loss of his friend, Francis seeks aid from the town police. Together, they find clues linking the cold-blooded killings with Dr. Caligari's priceless freak of nature. In the film's latter half, Francis and the authorities read through the Doctor's notes and discover his most fiendish, insane ambition: The old man gleefully named himself after an 11th century monk who once toured across Northern Italy with a somnanbulist at his side. Dr. Caligari's studies reveal how he recruited poor Cesare from an insane asylum and forced him to commit acts of murder and terrorize innocent people! After the awful truth is exposed, justice prevails as the wicked Doctor is bound in a straitjacket and dragged away. Or is he?<BR>I really love how Conrad Veidt's Cesare character is both terrifying and sympathetic. Although he basically wears a black bodysuit, his figure somehow provides the illusion of inhuman strength, like he was carved out of stone. However, that changes later on when Cesare breaks into the bedroom of Francis's betrothed Jane (Lil Dagover). In a state of torment, he raises the knife over his head and stops himself from stabbing the sleeping woman. In that instance, a viewer can realize that Cesare is only human, and that the Doctor is the true monster. The way actor Werner Krauss portrays him, by the way, is quite marvelous. He's clearly the manipulator of the story; a dangerously clever individual who tries desperately not to get caught. Finally, Friedrich Feher's Francis is a not a typical hero, but rather a traumatized young man seeking the truth; it's obvious that he's overcome with grief and driven almost mad. Did I say almost? As a participant in the movie's main action, Francis is both horrified and curious about the Doctor's motives.<BR>This is a movie I definitely recommend to the openly artistic. The DVD is the perfect gift for Tim Burton fans!
B0000024ZT|5.0|I shun all you who speak of this ablum in low regard.  How can you honeslty talk of &quot;Born in the USA&quot; ever living up to &quot;Lost in the Flood&quot;.  Please open your ears sometime and listen to both songs, then tell me that I'm right.
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is not your average &quot;let's get high and create a rocking album for the pop-masses&quot; CD. It has strong lyrics backed by hidden parts such as bass. While some may feel that Linkin Park is not a real band, they have obviously not listened to the other tracks on the CD besides the much over-played (It's still on pop music radio stations, which is sad) &quot;In the End&quot;, which still is a good track, despite being the track of 2002. Hybrid Theory should be an essential to any good CD collection
B00005JLT5|4.0|I guess we have all tendencies to compare this movie with the Shindler's list.This movie is certainly very close to the reality and as a matter of fact, it's really well done. I will mostly compare this to the movie serie named HOLOCAUST filmed in the 80's with Meryl Streep<BR>You become easily like involved in the story.If you want to compare with the Shindler's list, I will say the Spielberg's work was more telling about the period, the fate of most of the jews. Polansky tells about the fate of just one character walking in what Spielberg described.<BR>The pianist is someone who will have a lonely journey and it for sure makes the story,not less interesting, but flatter or quieter than the Shindler's list.Adrien Brody is simply excellent and it's an actor I'd like to see more often.<BR>Last thing, please try to get and watch Night and Fog, it's a french 30 minutes documentary by Alain Resnais. In it, no actor but real pictures, real people and I can tell you, It will certainly be the more horrible thing you have ever seen on a screen making very weak everything you saw about the subject.
B00005JLRT|4.0|While not a Star Trek devotee, I felt that this movie was very well done and good for those who don't consider themselves fanatics. The acting was pretty good, the special effects were excellent, and the story had some plot to it. The only thing I didn't like was the plot itself. Sorta freaky. But hey, maybe that's me.
B00005JM20|2.0|I love MR BEAN and I was impatient to get this movie. Okay it's not a masterpiece and you will not laugh all the time but you will have a good time wathcing it.Malkovitch is the funny nasty French (By the way it's French accent is quite poor :) and Imbruglia is the MR Bean Girl. Influenced by James Bond of course, the story has been already seen quite often and the jokes are more into those Leslie Nielsen could have done ! I just hope Rowan Atkinson in Mr BEan role for his next movie.<BR>It's still watchable !
B000050HTO|3.0|It is completely rediculous to call this CD essential, considering Dylan's been around for 40 years and has recorded TONS of stuff. A better title would be &quot;a brief tour of Bob Dylan's career, containing some of his classics&quot;. Truthfully, there's no point in buying this album, not even if you're new to Bob Dylan. Not wanting to completely thrash this CD, I'll say that most songs are pretty good (as is most of Dylan's stuff). Buy an actual Dylan album instead of this CD. Some Suggestions: Blonde On Blonde, The Times They Are A-changing, Desire
B000002JSZ|2.0|This C.D is not what i'd call the best album AC/DC's made. There's Flick of the Switch, which is a decent sounding song, but after that it's really boring. I see many people puting this cd before Fly on the Wall, but I have to say that this is alot worse. Don't buy it unless u can get it cheap.
B00000DHZJ|4.0|It is a good colection of Jimi's hit songs, but not the best of his stuff (Well, apart from &quot;Purple Haze&quot; which is and shall forever remain the best song in the world). The CD only includes one song (&quot;Crosstown traffic&quot;) from Electric Ladyland, Jimi's best album. It leaves out the mesmerizing &quot;1983...what a merman I Should Turn To Be&quot; and Jimi's landmark (once again apart from Purple Haze) song &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;. Nonetheless, it is THE place to start if you're  new to Jimi Hendrix (note: don't start with a live album! trust me!)
B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee has one of the best female rock voices out there today. She can sing, and she can rock. There are females who can do one or the other, but rarely both. Sadly, I have yet to see her do a live performance that lives up to the recording. The melodies are haunting, the instrumentation great. The lyrics are poignant and gripping. Yes, there could have been more hardcore songs, but for a first outing, this is first rate stuff. Here's hoping that the band will be able to continue with Ben Moody gone.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This band has me hypnotized. I end up having their songs in my head and for once in my life it is not an annoyance but a pleasant surprise. They're a great band and I also recommend their &quot;De Stijl&quot; album.
B000002UAI|5.0|This is one great Beatles album. It has the songs: No Reply, I'm a Loser, Baby's in Black, Rock and Roll Music, I'll Follow the Sun, Mr. Moonlight, Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!, Eight Days a Week, Words of Love, Honey Don't, Every Little Thing, I Don't Want to Spoil the Party, What You're Doing, Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby. My favorite songs are Eight Days a Week, I'm a Loser, and No Reply. I don't understand why this CD is in mono. I own a bunch of the Beatles old albums and each one of them is in stereo. But overall this has to be my favorite Beatles CD.
B000099T2L|3.0|What can I say?  This CD wasn't my favorite.  The duos with different artists on some (most) of the songs add some flare, but if you're gonna go solo, you have to sing alone!!  However, I did like a few songs on the CD.  Signs was one of my favorites cuz the lyrics are catchy and fun to listen to - at least one thing on the song applies to you.  Crazy in Love and Naughty Girl were good, but they make her sound too sleezy.  I did not like the flow of the album.  Most of the songs are slow, and you end up listening to like...6 slow songs in a row!  There aren't even any really fast songs on the cd.  Also, the CD was too typical R&amp;B.  Just like any other.
B000001GQT|5.0|Karajan is without peer in any of the Strauss Tone Poems. This work, made popular by 2001 A Space Odyssey (Incidently the version used for the movie is Karajan's recording with the VPO for Decca) benefits from Karajan's homogeneous account. I have heard his 80's digital version as well as countless others including, Mehta, Previn, Solti, Bernstein to name a few. This rendition is the standard and by far the finest. I would however own his 80's digital recording as well, for if ever there was piece that benefits from digital recording this is it. If stranded on a deserted island, the analog version would be my Zarathustra of choice.
0316666343|5.0|I can't recall reading any other novel that made me think about the story even after I'd finished reading the last page. I'm not sure whether or not it is the timing of this book's release, with the recent kidnappings, rapes and murders of real children across the country. Maybe it is the unique way the story is told, from a perspective I'd certainly never encountered. <br />Not being a deeply spiritual person, I don't often think of a heaven or an afterlife. The way Susie's afterlife is portrayed is somehow logical. I was briefly reminded of the movie Ghost at times, and also of Defending Your Life to a lesser extent. <br />Alice Sebold seems to leave out unnecessarily graphic or gory details while still describing the unthinkable nature of the murder. So few words, yet more than adequate. Instead, she thoroughly and beautifully describes how Susie perceives her heaven and how bittersweet her view of the living seems to be. From Susie's first love to her mother's eyes, Sebold paints quite a beautiful picture. This is a remarkable novel, certainly worthy of your time. Another book I enjoyed: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez. Two Great Amazon picks!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|A lot of reviews so far have done nothing but knock this album. All I can say is that I was blown away by this album. This is by far THE darkest DT has ever sounded. I know that the songs on this disc have been labeled &quot;nu-metal&quot;, and nothing could be farther from the truth. First of all, nu-metal doesn't even approach the level of musicianship of the album. Secondly, DT's sound is always being tinkered with, so what would make anyone believe that their next album will sound like this one. A commonly overlooked fact is that DT truly is a musician's band, in that you have to have a rudimentary understanding music and its principles. As for the songs themselves, I particularly like the last three tracks. &quot;Vacant&quot; is unlike anything I have ever heard from DT before, and I like the fact that the following &quot;Stream of Consciousness&quot; uses the same chord progression as a basis for an instrumental. Finally, &quot;In The Name of God&quot; is by far my favorite. The interlude is friggin' insane. I was very pleased with this album and the fact that DT keeps altering their sound. It ensures variety and keeps you guessing where their going next.
B0000B1OE7|5.0|There are reasons why this is on most people's top ten list of best Anime. It's got a good dose of action, great camera work, interesting chracters and plenty of violance & sex thrown in for good measure. This is definately not for kids!<br />Its about a wandering samurai. Along the way he crossed path with the 8 Devils of Kimon. Each of the \\"devils\\" have their own attributes or special powers. Its kind of like characters in a video game (why this has not been developed is beyond me)what with their special moves & weapons.<br />Those who have seen Animatrix might be familiar with the style & visuals. Specifically the segment entitled Program. It's done by Mad House, the same studio of Ninja Scroll<br />The first time I watched it was on video. And now this edition comes along. The noticeable difference is in the sound department (compared to video). You get it in full Japanese surround (also English dubbed). You can hear the effect of Tessai's (he has rock hard skin) double-blade sword as it boomerangs across the woods. The sounds of plentiful shurikens hitting a tree branch (like bullets off a machine gun). These are some examples of how great it sounds.<br />The visual department doesn't dissappoint too. <br />The real Jubei's character bio is included. Yes, he does exist (which I didn't know until this DVD came along). But most of his exploits are stuff of legend & not historically accurate.<br />My only gripe is the director's interview. I don't think it was professionally executed. While the interview is going on, you can hear noises ... phones ringing, doors opening & shutting. The Amaerican voice actors' interview is much better.<BR>But face it, you won't buy the DVD for the bonus features.<br />Ninja Scroll is a great Anime. If you haven't seen it, it's time you do. If you own it on video, it will be a worthwhile upgrade.

0064407667|1.0|\\"Lemony Snicket\\" (surely a pseudonym) has written a book that I would not want my children to read.  Not because of (...) or violence, but because it is a lousy book, poorly written with a poorly contrived plot that is an insult to the reader.  The author further insults the reader by talking down to him or her, with frequent interruptions to explain the meaning of words used.  Perhaps the intended audience consists of children with no access to a dictionary; but if so, why not be consistent and define ALL polysyllabic words used?    I was looking for a book to give it to my nephew for Christmas, and he has already read all five of the delightful [[ASIN:0545044251 Harry Potter Box set Books 1-7]] (5 stars each), but I wouldn't offer this junk to any intelligent child.    watziznaym@gmail.com
B00005JMFO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, and was not disconcerted until I left the theater and started thinking about it. It's sad to me that so many of the couples in the movie are being unfaithful to another in the name of \\"love.\\" I don't think it really is what it's all about.
0385504209|2.0|When I saw that this book had made the cover of Newsweek (and what the attending stories were about), I was a little intrigued.  When I saw that it had been on the bestseller list for so long, I decided it was worth a look.  Well, I read the whole thing, and I have to agree with the other reviewer who found the purple prose simply awful.  The ideas about the Holy Grail were interesting but the story did an awful job of carrying the information.  Nicely researched, but this guy could have used a co-writer or a literate editor/reader.<br />On the other hand, it was a (formulaic) page turner, and I can see it making a pretty easy transition to the movies -- probably what the author had at the back of his mind.  I'll recommend my friends wait for the video. So if beach reading is what you're picking this book up for, go to town.  You could easily do worse.  If you're looking for a great presentation of a scholarly idea, I'd suggest looking the Holy Grail or Mary Magdalene up in the non-fiction section of the library.  You'll probably get as interesting a read and certainly more brain food.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This whole album is insanely good. Jack white is one of the best guitarists to come out of the last century (if you don't agree then you know nothing about guitar.) The whole thing reeks of delta blues infused detroit garage rock.  The third guitar solo in Ball and biscuit is one of the greatest things I have ever heard.<br />Also--If your looking for more great WS get De Stijl, and download &quot;Jolene, CandyCane Children, and Lord send me an Angel) All great songs from thier older singles
B0000025RI|5.0|Apart from Thriller being the best selling album of all time, it is quite a good album for those who don't know yet! <br />It's been nearly 21 years since Thriller was released. To be frankly honest, it doesn't feel that long. Michael Jackson is still around after all these years but in a different state than he was then. Despite all the controversy that surrounds his controversial character, he still manages to come through as an achieving artist thanks to this particular musical event. For the younger people today, this album was an event when your parents were your age. <br />Thriller opens up with Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', a hyped up dance number that finishes off where Don't Stop Til You Get Enough left off. Baby Be Mine is a marvelous pop tune with cheerful lyrics and music, The Girl Is Mine reveals the heyday of the romance between Jackson and former Beatle Paul McCartney way before their fallout over the famous Beatle catalogue that Michael robbed from under Paul's hands. Put that aside, the song is a smart stab at pop extraordinaire. A duet that tops most others, with Paul and Michael taking turns in competing over their affection for one girl. Thriller, the title track, is one that everybody is familiar with thanks to that video where Michael transforms into a werewolf and then later into a zombie (a role that Michael has been obsessed with ever since). Billie Jean and Beat It, both highly publicized songs that got a lot of airplay and still do to this day, are fantastic. Billie Jean is pure R&amp;B at its best, while Beat It is pure rock at its most challenging (Beat It produced a memorable bassline and solo guitar) The best track, however, is Human Nature, a low key R&amp;B tune that shows Michael at his perfection in being a singer/songwriter. P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing) is another fun pop tune with the same style of Baby Be Mine, some memorable lyrics like 'Tendoroni you've got to be, spark my nature, sugar fly with me' and Janet Jackson on backingvocals way before her solo career began. Finally, Lady In My Life sets the last tone for the album, a pure R&amp;B ballad and a fantastic way to end a terrific album.<br />The album, overall, seems low key. But the great choice of songs and the excellent production of Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson took this album to heights nobody imagined. When you do listen to Thriller, put all the hype on the side and listen to it for what it is. An very good album by Michael Jackson.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|first I have to say this, I have actually listened to this album, unlike most people who hate britney. Why are people still buying her crappy music, she seriously sounds like a stripper whispering, how can someone like this be past other people on the billboards, like say people who have talent or actually play music, and also just because she gets a song credit does not mean she wrote the song, you can get a song credit for writing a couple of words. So to people who actualy like Britney go out and buy good music, because in a few years you will ask youself why did I ever buy this crap?
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This movie is a ride and an action packed one.  The movie has without a doubt some of the greatest action scenes in movie history, coupled with the drama and mystery surrounding the Matrix it makes for an intense movie.  We get to see Neo as the one with out many doubts about his abilities in the Matrix, yes he still has doubts about how he can save Xion but you see his transformation from unsure and apprehensive to somewhat arrogant.  As you see him going toe to toe with 3 agents in one of the openning scenes.  Agent Smith is perhaps one of my favorite bad guys of all time, he is just a character you love to hate.  The agent Smith fight scene with Neo is one of my favorite scenes of all time.  And the Freeways scene is just an adrenaline rush.  And how could you get upset about the cliffhanger at the end knowing the next chapter is only a few months away.  A great movie and an all out great trilogy.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is a must to own. It's something that the world has never heard before. Whether you love nu-metal or hate it, I still suggest giving this album a chance. While the music may not be increddibly talented (instrumental-wise) it's enough to &quot;make it work.&quot; Songs like Papercut shows this band's originality, Crawling demonstrates the amazing voice of Chester Bennington, and A Place For My Head is a song to go nuts in the pit to. Every track is loaded with the goods. =P <br />I highly suggest this album, however not Meteora.
0790729628|1.0|It seems that the long-awaited (and much vaunted) Special Edition of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; on DVD might be a much, much longer wait.<br />Of course, this means that the awful-looking, flimsy-featured DVD that showcases the '92 cut of this film will be the only one available for purchase here, there or anywhere. (1 star for the Warner Home Video product, but 5 stars for a truly great and inspired film).<br />According to an article in the New York Times, since neither Riddley Scott nor Warner Bros. owns the rights (for going over budget on the shoot, the rights per contract reverted to producers Bud Yorkin and Jerry Perenchio.  The article points out that Mr. Perenchio, C.E.O. of Univision, is, for some odd uknown reason, holding up the release of any new DVD version of the film (this guy gave a &quot;no comment&quot; response as for the reasons behind this).  This article was printed 12/14/03, so I fear that the information is neither old nor part of the rumor-mill (especially since the article was not written by Jayson Blair, hey! I believe it).<br />So, it seems fans are stuck with the shoddy DVD edition of the Director's Cut (which Scott says he was prepping to redo again for the special edition release, since he though he rushed through it the first time).<br />Sad news for a great film and a real fan format.
0596000480|5.0|This is the best book on Javascript. If you are doing serious amounts of Javascript on the front end, or in some scripting environment, this is worth getting. If you are doing something small, like data validation, you can probably get by with the Dynamic HTML book instead. I gave it five stars because it is such an excellent book on Javascript alone.

B00005JM02|4.0|Highlights: Spectacular computer animation; hilarious, well-developed characters; original plot.<BR> Lowpoints: Kids-oriented.<br /> Conclusion: Children will undoubtedly delve headfirst into the Pixar-animated waters to join the amusing ocean characters on their quest to find Nemo, who's been captured and kept by a dentist in Sydney, Australia. The plot keeps switching betwen Nemo's and his new friends' attempts to escape from the dentist's aquarium before his monstrous daughter comes to torture them; and Nemo dad's search; the film never loses momentum, providing a lavishly animated experience for the little ones. Unlike 'Shrek', or Pixar's earlier 'Toy Story I.II', 'Finding Nemo' has little appeal to parents. Still, marvel at the visuals, and lack of bad taste, so abundant in kids' flicks these days...

B0000B1OFL|3.0|Highlights: Stylish direction; slick editing; Charlize Theron & Ed Norton; relentless action; good humor; superb finale.<br />Lowpoints: Recycled material; Marky Mark & the rest of the crew play stereotypical characters.<br />Conclusion: Con-movie lovers will appreciate F. Gary Gray's ('The Negotiator' w/ Sam Jackson & Kevin Spacey) comeback in top form after the unfortunate Vin Diesel vehicle 'A Man Apart'. Obviously a remake (can't they come up with an original con plot? is it THAT tough?) of a 1960's classic that starred Michael Caine, 'The Italian Job' slightly improves upon the original with stylized editing (a-la 'The Thomas Crown Affair'), tons of sly wit and sexual innuendo between the protagonists (a-la, um,'The Thomas Crown Affair'...), and a rockin' good finale (a-la...you figure it out). Mark Whalberg looks bored (what happened to him after 'Boogie Nights'?), and the secondary characters are obligatorily exaggerated (the computer wiz/nerd; the smooth locksmith, etc) Ed Norton has fun as the villain though, and Charlize Theron is sexier than ever, but what the film lacks is originality - how hard can it be to improve upon decent material?
B000002U9W|5.0|In 1970 when I was 15, I met Atom Heart Mother. The days of the Beatles had gone. Even in Japan, the tide of &quot;New rock&quot; was coming with Led Zepplin, Deep Purple, Grand Funk Railroad, CCR, Chicago, and Pink Floyd.  AHM used the most advanced technolozy of music synthesizer at that days, and that amazed me with curious sound. AHM was too experimental, near classical music, and rhythm was far from the taste of the U.S.A. But, ATM had made me warm inside when I was in the middle of depression.
B0000DCGT0|3.0|If Ron Howard directed `Seabiscuit', the film would have, in all probability, drowned in its own sappiness. Gary Ross manages to avoid over-romanticizing, which is a considerable accomplishment, bearing in mind Hollywood's usual addendum of tear-jerking moments when it comes to adapting \\"prize-winning-semi-biographical\\" novels. I haven't read Laura Hillenbrand's novel, and I think it's for the better - the film was a tad too long anyways, and it would have been inconceivable for me to sit through it if I knew what was coming. It is a well-structured motion picture that won't surprise but will sustain interest. Despite the occasional slip into schmaltz (boy and horse interacting, aawww; Randy Newman`s embroidered score), under Gary Ross' practiced (`Pleasantville') guidance `Seabiscuit' is still a notch above the average Dream Factory melodrama. <BR>The film looks gorgeous. John Schwartzman's camera-work impresses, especially considering his previous efforts ('Armageddon' umm... 'Airheads'...) The mid-20th Century is well-portrayed, and the races are brilliantly photographed.<BR> The film also has heart, and most of it comes from the inspired performances, especially from its three leading stars. Jeff Bridges is one of the most underrated Hollywood actors (his Oscar-worthy performances in Peter Weir's `Fearless' and the Coen bro`s `The Big Lebowski' were ignored by the Academy), and gives a multi-layered performance as a kind but overly-motivated man, evading recollection of his son's loss by exploiting a young jockey (Maguire in his most nuanced performance since Ang Lee's `The Ice Storm') and a beat-down small horse with extraordinary abilities. Chris Cooper does `subliminal' as the horse's proprietor - he's a tranquil animal lover, who saved that horse and put his faith in it. <BR> Clearly, above all things, the film belongs to its horses - gracious, they elegantly gallop towards their fate - the viewers are treated with multiple angles of the race, as well as POVshots of the jockeys that are invigorating.  Seabiscuit, in spite of his minor bulk, is utterly believable as the champion of the stadium. It's not all triumphs for him, and the film, despite the flaws, competently guides its audience into cheering for its protagonist. <BR> Not a masterpiece by any standards, `Seabiscuit' is for horse-lovers and/or for younger kids, as a source of inspiration. The messages are pounded into the viewer's head, borderline frustrating, but Ross' assured direction will keep an average viewer mildly riveted.<BR>PS If you are not too into melodramas, horses, or Tobey Maguire boasting thinning red hair, then consider 'Seabiscuit' a 'rainy Sunday night movie'. On a Friday night, you'll think of ten thousand other things to do but be enveloped in Hollywood gloss. But on a rainy Sunday night, with a partner of the opposite sex perhaps, it would mae a purrfect treat.
B00005JMFI|4.0|I am normally not a fan of holiday-themed movies that are released each Christmas season. They are just not to my liking. But after reading and hearing about all the praise that ELF has been receiving from critics and the general public, I decided that I should see what everyone's talking about. I am now glad that I saw this movie as it made me laugh-out-loud several times! Will Ferrell does a wonderful job in playing Buddy the elf who was raised at the North Pole. After he realizes that he was adopted Buddy sets out to meet his biological father in New York City. One problem, Buddy's father is 100% invested in his job and is one the naughty list according to Santa. What follows is a fun adventure watching Buddy survive in the big city. <br />ELF is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud, even if you're a fan of Christmas movies.
B00005JMFO|5.0|I came out of this film with a smile on my face. what more can I say? Definatly a film to see repeatidly and a dvd to wear out. A sequel is a must. Everyone I have spoken to has their favourite mini story. Mine being the keira knightly one my friends being the hugh grant one. <br />All summed up I am getting ready to go the cinema to see this film for the 5th time(hopefully not the last!!!)
B0000013GT|5.0|Buy this album just cuz &quot;Two Dope Boys (In A Cadillac)&quot; and &quot;ATLiens&quot; are the best songs EVER.  &quot;Two Dope Boys&quot; with it's haunting, eerie ghetto beat and crazy rhymes will just give you chills.  And &quot;ATLiens&quot; is also eerie but will definetly get the party started.  These songs rule...period.  Buy this CD.
B0000028M7|4.0|&quot;Dirt&quot; is a great rock album, hands down.  It's the defining album of grunge's darkest band, and it's in all of its raw glory.<br />This album is not for the faint of heart, if the titles of the songs didn't let you know that to begin with.  If &quot;Dirt&quot; could be defined by a single concept, it's the emphasis on frontman Layne Staley's crippling addiction to heroin.  He somehow finds a way to poke fun at it in &quot;Junkhead&quot; (one of the album's few spots of fun), but mostly &quot;Dirt&quot; is filled with the self-hating, depressing, and nihilistic lyrics of a helpless junkie.  His screams of pain can be heard from the opening lyrics (&quot;I believe them bones are me&quot;) to the album's final riffs.<br />However, like Nirvana's &quot;In Utero&quot;, Alice in Chains manages to make this pain sound incredible, and crafted one of the decade's best rock albums here.  &quot;Dirt&quot; had several radio hits,  but there are gems here beyond those (&quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, &quot;Sickman&quot;, &quot;Dirt&quot;, and &quot;Godsmack&quot; come to mind).  My one complaint is that the album's so long it becomes numbing near the end, before recovering with the &quot;Angry Chair/Would&quot; duo.  However, that's a minor little quibble of mine- most of this music is great.<br />This is a chance to capture Alice in Chains in all of their pure glory, before their semi-pathetic decline and the tragic death of Staley.  This is a must-own for any grunge or heavy metal fan.<br />P.S.  I hope that Fred Durst fan is only kidding, otherwise he's coming off as a total moron.
B00004YZFR|1.0|BOUGHT THIS DVD RECENTLY TO SEE THE MUSIC THAT HAS TOUCH ME IN MY LIFE AS I'M ONLY 41 YEARS OLD THE MUSIC FROM THIS PERIOD IS MY FAVORITE AFTER VIEWING THE DVD IT WAS NOT ONLY SAD BUT SENSELESS THE WAY THE VIOLENSE TOOK AWAY FROM THIS MUSICAL PERIOD THIS IS THE FIRST REVIEW I HAVE EVER WRITTEN I WISH I NEVER WOULD HAVE PURCHASED THIS DVD I'LL NEVER WACTH IT AGAIN.<br />BUY MONTEREY POP OR THE WOODSTOCK DVD FOR THE MUSIC OF THIS PERIOD!
B000005H7D|5.0|This remastered edition of one of the ever-best Coltranes albums, deserve a place of honor in your bookshelf. It has some alternate takes of his major hits. Besides A Love Supreme, this in one of the fundamental jazz albums from the 20th century, indeed! Press play, and enjoy Coltrane in his purest &quot;cool but modern&quot; mood.
B000000993|5.0|This CD by Tool is definitely a work of art.  I could listen to Sober for hours and not get bored with it.  That isn't the only good song on this disc though, all of them are very artful and promote the skill of guitarist Adam Jones.  Maynard James Keenan has an incredible voice, and everything he says provokes thought.  Tool is one of the best bands around, and we are lucky to have them.
B00009MGR6|4.0|1988's Blow Up Your Video is along with 1985's Fly On The Wall and 1983's Flick Of The Switch one of the forgotten album of Brian Johnson era AC/DC. It is an album which takes a few listens to to appreciate beyond the first two tracks. The standout tracks on the album are Heatseeker, That's The Way I Wanna Rock N Roll, Go Zone, Kissin' Dynamite, Nick Of Time, and This Means War. The overall sound quality has also been improved on the reissue. On the original, Cliff Williams' bass was very low in the mix, and it is more audible here. This album is not as strong as some other Johnson era albums: Back in Black, For Those About To Rock, or The Razor's Edge, but it is still a very good album with strong songs. It also contains some of Angus Young's most underrated lead guitar work.
B00005JLWN|1.0|The premise is flawed and the movie is boring. Unfortunately I can't give it anything lower than 1 star. The action sequences are not very good at all in comparison to the Matrix. So even these, as a potentially redeeming factor, in the end leave the viewer unsatisfied. I don't know why there are so many reviews here giving this movie 5 stars. It doesn'tt deserve such a high rating at all. I rented this movie and am glad I didn't buy it. it certainly would not lend itself to repeated viewings. if you must see it, rent it instead.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Neo flies.  Trinity dies.  Morpheus cries (almost).  These are just three of the many scenes of The Wachowski Brothers' \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\", one of the most anticipated sequels of the last decade.  <br />The film begins with Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.  Neo is plagued by nightmares involving the death of lover Trinity (Carrie Anne-Moss).  He believes he is seeing the near future.  After a few neat CGI-filled scenes that show that to us, we find Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) (the latter of whom is being ridiculed by some fellow humans for belief in \\"The Prophecy\\") on their way home to Zion.  There they learn that the amount of sentinels has increased greatly.  The war is coming, or so we are told.<br />Morpheus meets with his rival, stern Commander Lock (Harry Lennix).  The two are constant competitors after Lock stole Morpheus' love, Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith).  They fight about what to do, what's coming, and what to believe.<br />So do we.  With \\"Reloaded\\", what began as a single successful film becomes an updated \\"Star Wars\\"-esque trilogy, with a seemingly unbeatable first film, a middle piece, and a battle-filled climax.  Many watchers will be put off from this film's lack of progression storywise, but that's meant to be.  It's the centerpiece for the story, and it's unfortunately quite hard to do much with the centerpiece (\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" still wows me).<br />What Andy and Larry have done is left open our questions from the first film.  Oh yeah, they added some new ones too.  And I get the feeling \\"Revolutions\\" doesn't clear them up either.  Ugh.<br />\\"Reloaded\\" is every bit as entertaining as the original film, if not a little more confusing at times.  There's enough action and excitement to keep anyone in their seats - especially the scene around the end of the picture, in which Morpheus and Trinity struggle to keep the Keymaker out of reach of The Twins and/or the Agents.  And, all of this occurs on what's got to be the most realistically vicious freeway I've ever seen.<br />One thing that I deemed unnecessary was the amount of sexuality.  There was a fair amount of sexuality (including nudity) and too much sappiness throughout the film.  Carrie Anne-Moss and Keanu Reeves making out?  I don't know about you, but that's not my idea of a good time.  Generally, things like this occur when the previously careful directors become more comfortable and popular ... which isn't always a bad thing.<br />The CGI animation is spectacular.  There's a slight drop in martial arts action from the first film, but the action sequences here are really fun.  Of course, they're accompanied by another great punk/metal/rock soundtrack and a fast-paced score from Don Davis.<br />One last note: Neo flies.  Yep, he flies.  As one of the Nebachudnezzar's crew puts it, \\"Uh-oh - he's doin' the Superman thing again.\\"  This happens about three times throughout the film, and while it does have a sort of cheesy and annoying feeling to it, I can't help myself but to find it fun.  And funny.<br />Overall, \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" comes nowhere near being as good as its predecessor, but it's a fun time at the movies, and definitely a recommended watch.  This series is getting better and better.  Now for \\"Revolutions\\".
0800196767|1.0|Matilda is an unwanted, mostly neglected child. Her father is a disreputible used car salesman and her mother is a self-absorbed Bingo player. Her parents obviously have taught her how to read, and they feed her - but they are otherwise pretty indifferent to her and refuse to acknowledge her intellegence.<br />Children who grow up without any affirmation, love or physical contact do not grow up to be well-mannered, well-rounded functional people - yet Matilda apparently rises above those statistics by having an idiot-savant like  ability with math and an insatiable hunger for reading.<br />Her parents refuse to let her go to school because she must stay at home to sign for packages of stolen car parts her father gets for his business. Defiant, she slips away to the library to escape into the world of literature.<br />Her father finally sends her to school when one of his customers, Principal Trunchbull, brags about her school in which children are treated like the garbage that they are.  That's a nice message to send to children, isn't it?<br />Trunchbull (Pam Ferris) is a chunky, javelin throwing, sadistic nut. She  has a faint mustache and is the obvious major antagonist of the story.<br />The principal has a tiny closet with protruding nails she calls &quot;The Chokie&quot; which she gleefully places children as she sees fit. For this element alone, nobody should expose their children to a film like this.<br />Beyond this horrific torture chamber, there is a strong suggestion that Trunchbull, who is the aunt of Matilda's beloved teacher, Miss Honey, likely murdered her own brother (Miss Honey's father) so she could have his money and his home. She is so evil, she even keeps photos of Honey's father and her childhood toys and dolls in a locker in the house and won't let her have them.<br />She is not a sympathetic character in any way - she truly displays pleasure in throwing darts at photos of children, throwing children out of the school windows and picking up a child by her braided pigtails and swinging her around like a shotput.  She doesn't even like animals. She is truly loathesome and feels threatened by Matilda's obvious super-intelligence.<br />For an unexplained reason, Matilda has a telekinetic ability and learns to concentrate her &quot;powers&quot; to retrieve Miss Honey's beloved objects and to terrorize the Trunchbull.<br />This film scares children - it tells children that they can be abused by teachers or other authority figures and shouldn't bother to tell their parents or the police, because no one will believe them. Their only hope is to hope that they can develop some sort of pscyho-kinetic power or cast a spell to make their conditions less wretched.<br />Is this the message we want to send to children? I did not read the book, so I cannot compare the book to the film - but I can tell you that the film is wretched and not entertaining in the slightest.  Even though Matilda and the children finally triumph over the Trunchbull, the damage to a child's psyche has already been done.  The underlying message is - if someone perpetrates evil upon you, don't tell your parents or the police, but instead use resources at your disposal to seek revenge.<br />Mara Wilson does a good job at the unusually confident, extroverted Matilda, but all the good acting in the world would not make this a film worth watching - especially for children.child by her braided pigtails and swinging her around like a shotput.

B00002MZ2C|3.0|Just to get this review started, im a moderate RAtM fan, nothing huge, but I'd put them in my top 10 modern bands list. One of the main problems I have with this album is that by this time Zach's anger and the band's sound is nothing new. This band was supposed to get people's attention by slapping them in the face with killer riffs, insane solos, and their molovtov cocktail of a frontman. This album was more of a poke in the ribs, &quot;Hey, it's us, Rage Against the Machine... we have a new album...&quot; I see this album as a subdued Rage, Rage-lite, diet-Rage, none of the riffs have that razor edge, Zach sounds like he's given up the fight, and Tom sounds like he's running out of ideas. Well, not all of it is as hopeless as I'm making it sound. The first three songs are quite good and are a perfect way to start an album. Then with Mic Check it takes a plunge into the land of unimpressive. They all follow the standard Rage sound, but without any passion or even the impressive themes. The idea was just played out. If you want a good Rage collecton, you can get the best songs from this installment on the new live album, but skip this. It's simply not as good as RAtM or Evil Empire.
B0000028MA|5.0|Eleven years later, and this is an unequalled achievement: Even post-Tarantino soundtracks and countless other greats, \\"Singles\\" stands up as the best soundtrack of all time.<br />Effortlessly blending all of the all-stars of the early 1990s Seattle scene except Nirvana, recorded JUST before they broke into the international music consciousness, \\"Singles\\" is both an amazing snapshot of a point in time and a great companion piece for fans of that music.<br />Songs unavailable elsewhere from Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Chris Cornell, Smashing Pumpkins and Mother Love Bone is something of a dream come true for many music fans, and what's especially nice is that there's no filler anywhere on this album.  Even lesser lights like The Lovemongers turn in great tunes, such as the band's rocking cover of Led Zeppelin's \\"Battle of Evermore.\\"<br />Sticking out as not being part of the Seattle scene is post-Replacements Paul Westerberg, but his two songs -- the only performer on the album to do two, although Chris Cornell performs both with and without Soundgarden -- are probably the best tunes in the collection.<br />While this makes a great companion piece to the movie, which features music quite strongly -- one scene even features a character stopping the action so his girlfriend (and the audience) can listen to a good section of Jimi Hendrix's \\"May This Be Love\\" (included on the soundtrack) -- it stands alone as simply a great album as well.<br />My strongest possible recommendation for fans of early 1990s rock music.
B000060P79|1.0|It is unsimple to keep these lame punk pop bands off this face of the earth! My ears almost feel off when my friend assaulted me with is cd! Throw this away and look for something better than this!!
0385504209|2.0|i read this book during the summer and am surprised to find it still atop the bestseller lists.  harlan coben,in his blurb on the back, writes &quot;perfect for history buffs, conspiracy nuts, puzzle lovers, or anyone who appreciates a great riveting story.'  well, i consider myself to be among the first and last, but found this less than a perfect fit for me.  after just a little bit of reading on the side, one finds most of the theories brown puts forth here are baseless, so plausibility goes right out the door.  it is a perfect story for conspiracy nuts, but there's a reason they're called nuts.  if i remember correctly there were 3 main puzzles for the protagonist, harvard symbologist robert langdon, to solve.  i solved 2 of them pages before he did.  one of them is just plain laughable.  harvard must be considering a suit.<br />  furthermore, the book is incredibly anti-catholic, but that institution has been under such pressure lately, they must have decided to let this one slide.  finally, the writing is horrible.  instead of writing chapters, he writes movie scenes...he even compares langdon to indiana jones.  want puzzles and history and conspiracy, go immediately to furst or lecarre; you'll get good writing too.
B00000IPAX|4.0|I know, Blink 182 sold out on this one.  They've drifted away from the earlier punkier sound to a poppier one.  This record is slicker and more packaged.  Its all true, but this is still an important album, not so much for the music but for what it led to.  The number of pop-punk bands inspired by Blink 182 must is incredible.  They took what Green Day (who are way more talented) had done and made it commercial enough for a younger generation.  You may hate the music on this album, but it did usher in a new era of music.

B000060P79|1.0|I'm actually surprsed that they would call themselves Simple Plan, it seems like their main goal is to seem more complex than they really are.  Unfortunately they suck at life and we get this.  It truly seems like these guys turned on the radio one day and thought they could achieve sucess by imitating the pop-punk already choking the airwaves.  They started with some emo, then added way too many pop hooks, thus taking away the emotional aspect of the emo, as well as the &quot;punk&quot; aspect they were going for.  They had screwed things up enough at this point and released their poorly titled album. Thus, Simple Plan was born.

B000002KIE|5.0|Everybody who has ever listened to any music punk-related should own this album.  It is the epitomy of punk and everything it stands for.  It is harsh, angry, and rude, and it should never be any other way.  If you don't own this, buy it.  You may not like it, but you have to take it for what its worth.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|...Spears has moved a long way from her 'sodapop' and 'dear diary' days,her image is less than wholesome but she continues to be in demand...ITZ is no masterpiece but it's loads of fun.She's experimented with POp,Hip hop,Techno,Reggae,R&B and asian genres.The result is an album full of potential singles and enjoyable tracks that will make you forget the world and sing along and dance till you drop.For those people who like songs with a deeper meaning you'll love \\"shadow\\" and \\"everytime\\".Club tracks include MATM,showdown,breathe on me and early morning.For hip-hop,r&b and reggae lovers,you'll love outrageous,the hook up and i got that (boom boom).Touch of my hand is a great song...Toxic is by far the best song on this album packed with string instruments and britney's vocals(which are quite good by the way) and brave new girl is a funky song mixed with a blend of techno/rap(i can't stop singing thissong).<BR>My Ratings are as follows:<BR>MATM-6/10 (not the strongest track,probably the weakest link)<BR>I got that (boom boom)-10/10 (who wudda thought of brit and the ying yang duo???)<BR>Showdown-10/10 (sexy song with a groovy beat)<BR>Breathe on me-10/10 (kylie's got some competition)<BR>Early Mornin'-8/10 (aka the hangover song)<BR>Toxic-10/10 (the best track and a master piece)<BR>Outrageous-9/10 (The paris hilton song...lol)<BR>Touch of my hand-10/10 (great music,deep lyrics)<BR>The hook up-10/10 (straight heavy dancehall beat,the type to make you shake your butt)<br />Shadow-10/10 (Beautiful song)<BR>Brave new girl-10/10 (funky song to crank up the volume to)<BR>Everytime-9/10 (nice music and lyrics but her voice is drowned out by the music-nevertheless it's a sad and touching song)<BR>MATM(remix)-10/10 (now this is what i call remix,better than the original version)<BR>If you're not afraid of your sexuality and fun side then buy this CD.If you liked her bubble gum pop then go listen to her other CD's.If you don't like her then tough luck...life goes on.I've read hundreds of reviews from this site and all i can conclude is that you can't please everyone.Some like her and some hate her but that's life and we learn to live with it...BR>i was shocked when i heard ITZ,i couldn't believe it was her!!!She changed and for the better in my books.
B00005JM02|5.0|As with other Pixar releases, very wholesomely enjoyable experience. Lots of layers for all ages, visually wicked and enticingly real.  Pixar has made many breakthroughs with each movie, with each having a quantum leap in something. The realistic water in Nemo is almost as noticable as the jaw-dropping realism of fur wisps in Monsters Inc.<br />You'll enjoy some wry wit in the inside jokes and homages. I kept expecting a &quot;Great Escape&quot; homage with Gill, perhaps having his gimpy fin look like a ball glove or such, but I suppose some would have pointed out that Chicken Run already did it. I did think that Gill's scar looked a lot like the facial scar in Platoon (problem being it was Tom Berenger's character that had the scar not Defoe's), but then again I might have been looking for way too inside jokes (how about a West Wing hint with the Star fish). I just about wet myself when she started trying to speak Whaaaallllle. I would have killed to have seen Ellen's face for real as she recorded those bits.<br />Not the least of reasons to watch this excellent family flick is the almost palpable emotion -- as a not so funny clownfish goes on an impossible trek through the ocean depths to rescue his only son.<br />An engaging, heartfelt animation.
B000094PYL|5.0|IN THRU THE OUT DOOR:<BR>Originally released with the \\"Brown Paper Bag Gag\\" in '79,<BR>this outstanding album showed the awesome range of Zep.<BR>This also turned out to be their last \\"official\\" studio album.<BR>(Bonzo died soon after,and CODA is just SwanSong leftovers)Tired of listening to their critics at that time, Zep simply released this album with no fanfare and literally wrapped it in a plain brown bag. This was very clever because it made this album appear even more mysterious than ever. \\"Fool in the Rain\\" even has a Latin feel to it. \\"Carouselambra\\" an epic! \\"In The Evening\\"<BR>a classic track that is very moody and dark. Often overlooked,<BR>this was Zeppelin at its peak. The Japanese version is also a rare find! No band in the world has been able to sound so good!
B00005ATQ9|5.0|By turns drawn-out and ecstatically engagingly, Barry Lyndon's is a very different Kubrick endeavour. The gorgeous cinematography and the impeccable lighting that capture the lush greens &amp; castles of Britain are a sight to behold.  He places the viewer *into* the eighteenth century. You are living it.<br />The pace of the film may be somewhat sluggish, it's a 3-hour piece, and several scenes offer the viewer no dialogue at all because this was a time when the gesture, the look, the subtle formality communicated far more than the spoken word. A sharp contrast to today's &quot;fast and furious&quot; approach to film-making. But that's Kubrick for you -- much more to savour than to devour. A spectacle in a class by itself. Must-watch if you can lay your hands on it.
B00008IHN1|5.0|I loved drumline.  It was tuly enjoyable to be immersed in the black college experience if only for a little while.  As for Lou, Ky: The fact that you bought a used DVD speaks to your lowly station in life; your misuse of language speaks to your lack of education; and, your racist review speaks to your cultural bankruptcy. So get off the dirty sofa, dust off your<br />wife beater tee shirt, and drive the trailer ( oh, that's your house too) to a professor at a college near you (if there is one), for translation.
B00005JL78|4.0|This Sci-fi Mystery/Action film is a remake that could be done by no other than Speilburg himself. This helped to reintrouduce a movie that was once popular in the 70's to a younger generation such as myself with a few added twists and plots. Tom Cruise did a very good job playing this role and making it exactly what it should be. The plot and action was very well done and the whole concept of stoping future crimes and events just play with your thoughts a bit about the real future and where we will be. I got the Dvd as a gift but I would have no regrets buying it. Anyone still haing doubts should rent it and see but no need for extra hassle ........Just get it!
B000002KXO|3.0|While Fleetwood Mac's 1982 album &quot;Mirage&quot; is not a total waste, it still could have been much better. &quot;Gypsy&quot; by Stevie Nicks, &quot;Hold Me&quot; and &quot;Love in Store&quot; by Christine McVie and even &quot;Book of Love&quot; by Lindsey Buckingham are the best tracks. Lindsey's other tracks sound too unusual. &quot;Only Over You&quot; is a beautiful song by Christine. Nicks's other two songs, &quot;That's Alright&quot; and &quot;Straight Back&quot; are well written but not her best works. The group was trying to follow up &quot;Tusk&quot; with another &quot;Rumours&quot; style album with this one. Even with the hit  singles it didn't work as well as their first two did. If you are looking for a good follow-up to &quot;Rumours&quot;, after &quot;Tusk&quot; even, got to &quot;Tango&quot;, a fantastic album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Because of my work schedule I was unable to watch this show when it originally aired.  However, because I had heard good things about it I bought the DVD set.  I've just finished watching the set and I am amazed by the quality of the writing and the storytelling. They were far beyond the norms of network telvision.  It was a jewel.  I hope that the rumors of a feature film are true.  I plan to be among the first in line.

If you haven't read their books this past year, I would recommend them for your New Year, to help create a new, more powerful and intuitive New You in 2004:<BR> <BR>- Deepak Chopra: The Spontaneous Fulfilment of Desire <BR>- Jack Canfield/ Mark Hansen: Chicken Soup for the Soul: Living Your Dreams (Not Local, but excellent, uplifting stories)<BR>- Tiffany Snow: Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life - Tools to Connect<BR>- Marie Jones: Looking for God in All the Wrong Places
0156027321|5.0|Sorry, but that first person, it seems like YOU missed the undertones of this book!  Look, outside of Ghandi, what vegetarian would rather starve to death than eat a fish if you'res stuck out in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific and have to feed a 450 pound Bengal tiger to keep him from eating you?  Once you tell me (or better yet show me) that you can do that, then you can talk.<br />This is a book about hope and faith, the ESSENCE and UNDERLYING TRUTH about faith that isn't affected a wit by vegetarianism or doing what is necessary for survival: hope and love of God.  Honestly, do you really think that it's the empty practices of faith that inspire people?  No, it's God Himself who is not hampered by such things, now is he?<br />And as for the brutality, if this story was too brutal for you I suggest you stick to the pre-k section next time, but then again, all those fairy tales where knights slay the dragons may be against your religion and too violent for you.  Hm, maybe you'd better just write a whole new line of fluff books about the Happy Doughnut or something.<br />Honestly, this was an inspiring story, even if the end took the edge off it, of hope and the perseverance of faith and to say that is advocates anything against religion or religious practices is the most ridiculous libel that I've ever heard.  You should wish that you had Pi's faith.<BR>Katy
B00004YC2F|5.0|I am frankly, flabbergasted as to the negative criticisms of this recording!  It is simply, sonically AND artistically the best performance of this concerto on the market today.  It's better than the Weissenberg/Pretre version.  It's better than Argerich!  Yes, it's even better than Horowitz himself!  It's simply astonishing. I have over 50 recordings of this piece and this one surpasses them all.  I have recently listened to every one of the recordings I have, and none even come close.  The sound is fantastic.  The playing sublime.<br />Volodos plays the entire work without any cuts for starters unlike the Horowitz, Janis, Wild, Watts and Rachmaninoff, himself, versions and connects the whole thing together structurally tight as a drum.  Volodos plays the heavier cadenza in the first movement, and quite simply, gives the most stunning performance of it I've ever heard.  The only person who comes close is Cliburn's legendary 1959 recording, but the sound isn't as good, obviously, and Cliburn doesn't have Volodos' sense of spine-tingling drama and excitement (though, I'd have to say Cliburn's rendition is not far behind).<br />Volodos' playing of the 2nd movement is beautiful beyond compare.  He takes the 3rd movement at a breakneck speed and one can hear just about every note, unlike many performances (Argerich's for one) where half the notes on the piano aren't even audible.  Argerich's performance, while fantastic, is simply not as well thought out, technically as perfect, nor as carefully prepared as Volodos'.<br />Levine and the Berlin Philharmonic are excellent and the sound quality is the best I've ever heard on a live recording.  I would be interested to know how much touch-up work was done on it if any.  The piano can be heard properly at all times unlike many newer Rach 3rds that try to \\"integrate\\" the orchestral and piano parts so it sounds like a symphony, which it is NOT.  IT'S A PIANO CONCERTO and the piano needs to be heard almost all the time as the most prominent player; and this recording fills the bill most expertly.<br />Bravo to the Sony engineers for doing such a fantastic job; bravo to James Levine and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra for such beautiful accompaniment;  and, finally, kudos and bravissimo to Volodos. Quite simply one of the greatest pianists of his generation in my opinion.
0553213105|5.0|My appreciation for the satrical and old English type of work began with my enjoyed comsumption of the novel, Jane Erye by Charlotte Bronte at the not-easily-amused age of 13. The emotion and attachment set to the characters of such novels is fully upheld and boundaries of literature appreciation are exceeded with the reading of Pride and Prejudice. The essence of a classic novel that can stand the tests of time is displayed in this masterpiece of Jane Austen.  Wit and one liners by the ever enjoyable Mr. Bennet reminds you of your favorite uncle, while the observant eye of Elizabeth Bennet reminds you of friend you always wished to have as she takes a stand on the dullness of humdrum society, constantly giving something to ponder and test the limits.  This satire on nineteenth century Europe has a wonderful approach, allowing some periods of a curved brow that silently screams in agreement with our heroine, Elizabeth, all occuring between a chuckle of amusement that is often choked by a surprise twist of the storyline of the other well illustrated characters.  This novel is recommended for the modern day romantics who would appreciate a played story of hard-to-get; for the everlastining realist who loves the power felt when a opinion and lifestlye is presented against the grain of normality; and finally, for the everyday classical reader who can ever remember a time where self-pride has made a place, only to be broken by the realization that prejudice is only what sets people apart.  A classic situaion in our heterogeneous society where everyone carries a pride-filled opinion of our surroundings, forgetting that individually we make up the prejudiced society. Gradual and humble realization is to follow, as in the likewise case of Miss Bennet, while the timeless saga and appreciation of Pride and Prejudice continues...
B00008J2DQ|1.0|I am a rabid Godsmack fan.  I roared out to buy this CD, even when some of the music magazines gave it a poor review.  I want my money back.  This CD left me asking why I was paying 16 dollars, after tax, to listen to a persons whine sessions with their psychiatrist.  The one good gitar solo gets cut off and left to hemorages on the recording floor.  Where are the driving drums I came to love?  Save you money, save your time, buy the earlier CD's.
B00005JLH3|4.0|Drum line was a pleasing, fun film to watch.  Your synopsis of the film is based in pure ignorance.  Many of us have too often seen a film, for instance, The Lord of the Rings, and wondered &quot;Where are the Black/African American People?&quot;  I must mention how appreciative I was to see Orlando Jones as a man lead by his ethics. The speech patterns featured by SOME of the cast are common among youth of ALL races/ethnicities in our country.  If you do not like films featuring people of color, perhaps you should hide in your hovel for the rest of your years, since you are not useful to society.  And, PS. you people eat greasy fries too.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears new album has finally arrived and shes back with a with a bang.  This is the BEST ever Britney Spears cd.  Britney takes her music to a new level here working with a new range of producers, song writers and she co-wrote 8 of the songs.<BR>ME AGAINST THE MUSIC features Britneys musical idol none other then Madonna in this fast and funky first single release. This song is Produced by up and comers Redzone. Britney helped co write it! And this only touches what 'in the zone' has to offer. (I GOT THAT) BOOM BOOM features the Ying Yang Twins, is a fun dance single. SHOWDOWN is also cowrote by Britney. BREATHE ON ME is one of Britneys favourite tracks and fans won't be disapointed this is such a cool song. Early Mornin is the Moby and Britney cowrote song and another terrific song.  This is defintely the best c.d i have heard.  Britney fans will really see Britneys fun and bubbly personality shine through.  TOXIC - is Britneys second single to be released and is another great dance tune.  Most of the songs are fun, funky dance songs. However Britney shows her softer side in SHADOW and EVERYTIME - everytime is rumored to be written about ex boyfriend Justin Timberlake where she sings about a lost love.  Shadow is a nice song written by Avril Lavinges team the MATRIX and while it's an okay song, i don't really think Britney needed the 'avril link'. I mean Britneys,BRITNEY SPEARS!! BRAVE NEW GIRL is where britney shows off her rapping skills and does it well.<br />This is the best c.d ever, however if you want it get the import with the two extra songs, the answer and don't hang up.  THE ANSWER was the P.Diddy song and both of these songs are worth having on the album. Don't miss out
0804106304|5.0|THose that say that this book is confusing, it is. But Amy Tan makes this novel confusing to illustrate the main theme in this book: Americans don't understand Asian Americans and the chinese culture. I've read this book several times in and out of the classroom and enjoyed it throughly. It tells of morals that can apply to anyone, such as the strained relationship between mother and daughter. I highly recommend this amazing novel to anyone.
B000005JA8|4.0|Love it or hate it, this album is certainly controversial.  I, believe that it takes more than controversy, however, to keep an album continuously in print for almost 35 years.  Obviously people are buying it, listening to it, and even (gasp!) enjoying it.  Many reviewers have resorted to comparing it to this, that, or another Beefheart album - giving a sort of 'mini review' of the other album in the process. Since, to my knowledge, none of the reviewers have yet stooped to reviewing 'Trout...' in the context of Van Vliet's entire 'original' discograrphy I figure why not give it a whirl?  Here goes:  <BR>   SAFE AS MILK (3.5 stars)- Some great material along with some rather average cuts, but, in the final analysis this disc runs on \\"Electricity.\\"<BR>    STRICTLY PERSONAL (4.5)- Great psycho-blues and sundries.  Some may complain of 'phasing' effects added in the final production but I remain unphased. The overall mood and rhythmic construction of some of the songs serve as harbingers of whats to come.<BR>    TROUT MASK REPLICA (4)- Personally, I have never had any problem with 'ours truly'.  I've always enjoyed it, never tried to 'get it' and have always been able to discern a rhythmic structure to most of the material.  Approach this one with an open mind and a sense of humor and you'll do fine. Approach it with a drug-addled brain and heaven help you. Just remember, the mind is a terrible thing to lose.<BR>     LICK MY DECALS OFF, BABY (4.5)- Ditto 'Trout' comments - but slightly better recorded with bigger cajones and a heftier bottom end - all in half the playing time.<BR>     THE SPOTLIGHT KID (4.5)- Don does the blues, with a twist - and how twisted and blue can you get?  \\"Glider\\" really wets my blues whistle - and then there's \\"Alice in Blunderland\\" - (to quote an old hippie I knew) \\"It's all good stuff, man.\\"<BR>     CLEAR SPOT (4)- Great listening despite a couple rather drab cuts. This one runs on Beans (From Venus) which, FYI are quicker than electricity.<BR>     UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED (2)- There is a gold nugget amongst the mud here - the absolutely beautiful \\"This is the Day\\" - most of the rest I can take or leave (\\"Full Moon, Hot Sun\\" & \\"Peaches\\" make me wanna puke).<BR>     BLUEJEANS & MOONBEAMS (4)- So what if the Captain used studio musicians. A finer pop/rock/blues album doesn't come around very often. I always brings a smile to my face to think that the same person who sings \\"Observatory Crest\\" also sang \\"When Big Joan Sets Up.\\"<BR>     SHINY BEAST (BAT CHAIN PULLER) (5)- The release of this flawless collage of pop/rock and 'music from the other side of the fence' is what put the beef in my heart and changed me from a mere aficionado to a rabid fanatic. This is (after 'Bongo Fury') my second overall alltime favorite album, and it also contains my favorite Beefheart song \\"The Floppy Boot Stomp.\\" Beautifully recorded, with phenomenal vocal and instrumental performance by a Magic Band in top form.<BR>     DOC AT THE RADAR STATION (5)- The Captain's primal scream, raw, visceral, unfettered, and indescribably brilliant.  As compelling as 'Shiny Beast' - but for an entirely different reason. Here Van Vliet achieves what he was merely groping at in his much earlier experimental albums. A reviewer has described this album as 'Shark Mask Replica'- I'd have to agree.<BR>     ICE CREAM FOR CROW (4)- A valiant final musical effort by an increasingly disillusioned man. Evocative of the blend of styles laid out in his previous two albums but mildly hamstrung by two tracks that don't quite make the grade.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I kept my eye on this box set untill the day it was released. Now that I have it I would have to say im glad that I spent the money on it. There is a ton of good things I would write about it so im only going to put down the negitive comments which are few. Really the only thing I didnt like was that in the Alien 3 Special Eddition, which I was very interested in watching because of how much they added to it, the sound for the special eddition parts couldnt be recoverd. Still overall the movie is great to watch even with that downfall. The only other bad thing about it was it wouldnt fit on my table cause the dvd box set opens to 5 feet! lol. All in all, if you liked the movies even if you thought some were way better than others, its still worth getting.
B00014NE62|5.0|The filmmakers did an incredible job of bringing E.M. Forster's touching novel to life -- and I suspect that was no easy task because so much of the novel involves the main character's innermost thoughts and feelings.  However, Merchant and Ivory did a beautiful job conveying the loneliness, fear and desperation of the main character, Maurice Hall.<br />The movie follows Maurice (James Wilby) down his road of self-discovery;  from his embarrassing teen years to Cambridge (where he gets his first exhilarating taste of love) to his post-collegiate years as a young man struggling to come to terms with his sexuality in a time when homosexuals were mercilessly persecuted.<br />The movie is also very much about class struggle.  Maurice is a gentleman born and bred, with a penchant for snobbery.  As he comes to terms with his sexuality, he is forced to deal with differences in class when he realizes he is in love with someone from the serving class.<br />Readers of the novel will be delighted as much of the wonderful dialogue from the book appears in the film.<br />The characters were perfectly cast, with Hugh Grant (before he was a mega star) as Clive Durham, the perfect young gentleman from Cambridge (and Maurice's first love), Rupert Graves as the smoldering, lower class hunk who wins Maurice's heart, and Ben Kingsley in a hilarious turn as Maurice's junk-psychologist.  James Wilby was spot-on in the title role and he perfectly captures the isolation, sadness and ultimate joy of the conflicted Maurice.<br />\\"Maurice\\" is a touching love story that anyone -- straight or gay -- can enjoy.  Romance knows neither of these terms.  And, the movie *is* unabashedly romantic and optimistic  -- your heart will soar when Maurice finally gives in, casts societal conventions aside and visits his beloved at the boathouse.  The hopeful ending is inspiring, though the close-up of Clive at the window at the end of the movie will break your heart.<br />Beautifully filmed, superbly acted -- a must-see film.- a must-see film.
B000000OTU|5.0|BIG ONES is the perfect Aerosmith collection of songs from their comeback era.  Pulling all the right songs from the Greffen label.  In my opinion more could have come from the PUMP cd, and 2 of the 3 new songs could have been left off.  Only DUECES ARE WILD, come close to being as good as the hits on this cd.  A great place to start if your not a Aerosmith fan.
0385504209|5.0|When Jacques Sauniere, the elderly curator of the Louvre museum in Paris, is mysteriously murdered, he leaves a chain of clues, in the last minutes of his life, that lead to one of the most important historical secrets. These clues bring the curator's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu, and Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist who is staying in Paris at the time, together.  As they follow the clues, they discover that Jacques Sauniere was part of a secret society called the Priory of Sion, whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Leonardo Da Vinci, among others. As the two race through Europe they find secrets and symbols hidden in the works of Da Vinci and in famous churches. What Langdon and Sophie don't know is that the clues which the late curator left behind lead to two different secrets that are connected by one pinpoint.<br /> In this novel about history, deception, conspiracy, secrets, and puzzles, there is nothing not to like. By the first paragraph of the book you are riveted, and can hardly put it down before you are done. Dan Brown's writing style is terrific, you read from a variety of different characters' points of views. With Dan Brown constantly switching the novel from the point of view of one character to another it makes you want to keep reading. The characters are brilliant, none of them are perfect, and they all have faults. Dan Brown develops a ripe, full personality and voice for every character. The story is so believable that you might actually find your self wanting to go on a trek looking for the Holy Grail. The author is excellent at making you believe one thing and then changing it. For example, who the Teacher really is. Beware it will surprise you but once you figure it out it will seem perfectly reasonable. All the puzzles and secrets keep you hooked and trying to figure them out for yourself. The only thing that the author should do to the book is put pictures of the art and buildings that are mentioned, in the back.<br />There is not one place in the Da Vinci Code that you will become bored and want to stop reading. I recommend it to any one who is looking for a brilliant book to read, for it will appeal to all age levels and will keep you wanting to turn the page even when you know you have to put it down.back. <BR>There is not one place in the Da Vinci Code that you will become bored and want to stop reading.

B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, is probably my favorite<BR>album of all time, it has a song for every mood i'm in.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|This DVD is wonderful on many levels. Where to begin. The opening Indian sequence is superb with the musicianship shown by Anoushka Shankar breathtaking to behold. The Indian Orchestra are no slouches either!! While it may be a little tempting for some to skip ahead to the &quot;western&quot; part, this opening section of the concert has to be seen and heard to be believed. Originally &quot;The Inner Light&quot; was issued in 1968 as a Single B-Side to &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;. I've always loved this song. Here it's given beautiful treatment in a sublime performance by Jeff Lynne, Anoushka, Indian players along with George's son, Dhani Harrison on piano. I hadn't fully appreciated the intricasies of this song until I watched Anoushka perform it on the Sitar. She then proceeds to conduct the Indian Orchestra on &quot;Arpan&quot;, a specially composed piece by her father, the Legendary Ravi Shankar. With an amazing interplay between the Indian players and a Orchestral String Section plus Eric Clapton on Acoustic Guitar, the song takes us on a marvellous journey. Yes Dhani, your Dad would love this. <BR>In a  fashion only George could appreciate and approve of, the seriousness of the preceeeding wonderful moment is consigned to fading memory as the Monty Python &quot;Barber Shop Quartet&quot; regales us with &quot;Sit On My Face&quot;, bare backsides and all with respectful bows to George's portrait. Michael Palin then leads the guys into &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; after a funny  but fruitless  &quot;tribute&quot; to George. Tom Hanks guests as a stand-in Mountie. <BR>After a brief intermission we are entertained by an amazing band, all George's mates, led by Eric Clapton. It was also eerie on 2 fronts (1) the image of Dhani on centre stage with his peers playing rhythm guitar as part of the band all the while looking like George circa 1963-64 and (2) the most amazing aspect of the band itself was the sound it generated, with George's slide sounds particularly replicated so accurately, you'd think George was up there with them...I'm sure he was in spirit!.  The special moments are numerous. Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers, Jeff Lynne, Joe Brown and daughter Sam, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Gary Brooker &amp; Eric Clapton all contribute truly faithful renditions of George's classic songs. Ringo also chipped in with &quot;Honey Don't&quot;, a Carl Perkins classic, truly appropriate as Carl was a hero to George. No egos, no grandstanding, just beautiful musicianship from all concerned. The tributes to George were very understated, the introductions to the various performers simple and to the point. Yeah Ringo was jolly, but that's Ringo. Paul's ukele version of &quot;Something&quot; with Eric Clapton &amp; band joining in halfway was nicely contrasting while moving. His rendition of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was very poignant while &quot;For You Blue&quot; brought back memories of &quot;the old 12 bar blues&quot;. He then takes a back seat like the other guys and just plays piano and sings along. Billy Preston's take on &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; is very special indeed. Sam Brown is exceptional on &quot;Horse To The Water&quot;. Petty &amp; Co. on &quot;Taxman&quot;, &quot;I Need You&quot; and with fellow Wilbury Jeff Lynne on &quot;Handle With Care&quot; do George proud. Again, &quot;Taxman&quot; is a real highlight because George's great original guitar work is accurately reproduced here and it's only now, after watching it played, can I realise it's complexity. George was a much better guitarist than I had previously realised. Many other special moments are too numerous mention.   However the Joe Brown ukelele finale &quot;I'll See You In My Dreams&quot;, complete with red and yellows flowers dropping like confetti into the grand looking Albert Hall, a very apt venue, is a &quot;suitable ending&quot; to  momentous occasion.  Unlike many recent concert DVD's,  the camera work here focuses on the musicians at hand and the concerts many highs are beautifully presented as a result. Thank you. It was a truly emotional occasion for all present, be they performers or audience and it was a fitting tribute to George's memory. <BR>The 2nd disc includes a shorter cinematic version as well as interviews and rehearsals which are a wonderful experience to watch. The preparations during the &quot;Indian&quot; rehearsals are fascinating and watching Ravi Shankar compose on the fly and then try to interpret his intentions to the String Section make for some really nice moments. The interviews with Dhani are particularly special especially when he demonstrates things his Dad showed him to play and when he talks about the experience of being on stage with such a huge band... 8 guitarists, 4 drummers...wow! Python backstage is also great fun and the rehearsals very entertaining. <br />Overall if you don't like this DVD then you've probably got a heart of stone and ice in your veins or you're just very hard to please indeed. I can't fault it and I utterly, utterly recommend it to anyone who love George Harrison's music but also those who love concert DVD's.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul did not sell as many copies as the White Album, does not have the iconic imagery of Abbey Road, and is not considered as important as Sgt. Pepper. But it does have 14 very strong tracks. Classics such as In My Life, Nowhere Man and Drive My Car are complimented very well by the lesser known likes of I'm Looking Through You, Wait, and the underrated Run For Your Life. Believe me: every song on this album is a gem.
B000005ALP|5.0|The greatest word to describe this album is beautiful. It starts off with Novocain for the Soul, which has a sort of nostalgic theme while reminding me of a music box. The record goes on to Beautiful Freak, which has haunting piano music and vocals, to ending with Manchild, the only song on the album which hasn't completely captured me, simply because of the girl whining in the background. This is an extremely solid album. While alot of people think it's depressing, I find it rather affirming and certainly uplifting. Its soft, skillful, poignant music has that magical ability to take you to some emotional place you've never been, where you aren't completely happy but you're perfectly content with everything and wouldn't change any of it.<br />The lyrics, on paper, seem highly disregardable, but when the singer E embraces them, they have more meaning than anyone ever imagined. His voice is pregnant with a contagious emotion that you cannot help but absorb.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I am a major classic rock fan Beatles, Zeppelin, The Who, The Kinks, Small Faces, Tull, and Yes are some of my favs and Im a teenager so it was kind of weird being so young and liking that music and I always wanted to hear a modern band that wasnt rock but rock n' roll because there is a difference and these guys are it I love their style and their music all of their songs are AMAZING! I highly reccomend this album to any fan of good music
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Wake up! The world we live in, the one many of us believe we have lived in since the day we were born, is not real. You, as well as those around you, may believe that it is the year 2003 but it is actually closer to the year 2099, or some time close to that. The world has been overrun by the Machines who have subjugated the human race into a vast computer programming network known as The Matrix in order to keep them in line and use them to power to city and army. Sounds farfetched, huh? Prior to 1999 you would have been right but that was before the release of The Matrix, the highly acclaimed cult film that sent shockwaves through Hollywood with it success on DVD and surprised everyone with the announcement of two sequels budgeted at $300 million set to be released in 2003. Though the first sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, will contain an R-rating, not unlike its predecessor, many analysts expect the highly anticipated summer release to break significant box office records on its to possibly challenging Titanic for the highest domestic grossing film title. The hype for this film has been building for quite some time as fanatics chatted online and trailers played before nearly every film in release and all that anticipation has come to a peak. Now it is up to the filmmakers to demonstrate that all the waiting and overloaded hype were well worth the wait.    The story for The Matrix Reloaded, though a follow-up to the original The Matrix, does not exactly pick up where the original film left off. The whole Matrix universe is a complex story line that requires numerous side ventures to full realize what is going on, this includes The Animatrix DVD and the Enter the Matrix video game. But for those certain individuals going into this film practically blindfolded, here is a simple and basic story line for what is occurring in The Matrix Reloaded: It is the year 2099 and mankind, or what is left of it, continues an ongoing battle with the machines that has lasted over a hundred years. Prior to the beginning of the war, the machines ruled the world and forced all of mankind into a form of slavery. By building a vast computer system known as The Matrix, they were able subjugate humans into creating energy for them without any direct human being ever knowing they were doing so. Few were able to break free of The Matrix including Morpheus, Trinity, Neo and the people of Zion, the last stronghold of the human race. As they continue to do battle with the machine world, they draw ever closer to answering the burning questions: Why are we here? Why are doing what we do? Why us? And that is as simple as one can get without giving away key aspects of the film. Though the plot of the film can get quite confusing, even to those that are familiar with the original film, The Matrix Reloaded significantly builds on the complexity of the original The Matrix and goes one step further in presenting brilliant philosophical concepts to the teeming masses.    The cast of The Matrix Reloaded make eloquent contributions to the film and is greatly expanded from the small group that was presented in the original film in 1999. There is no doubt in anyone?s mind that Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as the role of Neo, or The One. There was some question with the original film on whether Reeves could handle such an important role but he positively proves his worth in this film presenting a character that is different from when we last saw him but at the same time still as enduring as he was in the original film. Carrie-Ann Moss, who reprises her role as Trinity, is placed more center stage in this film then last time, allowing more screen time to demonstrate the character?s importance to the entire story, more than some had originally thought. Laurence Fishburne is, as he was in the first film, delightful as Morpheus. Fishburne is able to express more emotions within this film even though he does not play as significant a role as he did with the original film. JadaPinkett Smith is decent with her role but she doesn?t really do all that much to give the audience a reason to care all that much. Hopefully her role will be expanded in The Matrix Revolutions. And Monica Belluci?s Persephone seems like a waster as she is given little to do outside of being anything more then eye candy for the young male audience. Unfortunately her acting range isn?t presented in this film which is a disappointment after good word of mouth coming from roles in foreign films.    Overall, though The Matrix Reloaded doesn?t exactly live up to the tremendous amount of hype that surrounded its release (what film could?), it is definitively the event film of the summer and quite possibly the year. Even with the fact stated, there are several things to pick at about the film including the large amount of kissing scenes between Neo and Trinity. After a certain point you would think the audience would get the idea that these two are madly in love with each other but apparently the filmmakers thought that the whole ?eating each other?s faces? would better express that point. Another scene that seemed to be a big problem with everybody was the ?orgy? scene in the city of Zion. What was the point of this? Granted it could be to express the concept of life and the present moment but could they have not done this in a better way then they did? It was amazing to see how quickly this film went from being a total sci-fi action flick to a porno and then back to a sci-fi action film. Though the sporadic sexual references throughout the film weren?t a significant problem, they did manage to be quite annoying after awhile and could have easily been eliminated from the film. But other then those small complaints, The Matrix Reloaded is the must-see film of the summer and should be seen for its astounding special effects alone, though at times they do feel a bit over-the-top, namely the ?Burly Brawl? sequence between Neo and the multiple Agent Smiths. The film is not perfect by any sense of the word but for those who do appreciate it, they will know that this is only one half of a two part film. Don?t forget to stick around after the credits to check out the exciting teaser trailer for The Matrix Revolutions.
0688163173|4.0|U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule have taken the ferry from Boston to Shutter Island, the site of Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane, a maximum security institution. Daniels has been called in to help locate an escaped patient, a certain Rachel Solando, who found herself in Ashecliffe after murdering her three children. How Rachel escaped is a mystery, though the fact that she managed to break out of a locked room and get past several manned checkpoints and a gaggle of poker-playing orderlies suggests that she had a lot of help.<br /><br />The fact of Rachel's escape is not the only strange thing about Teddy's new assignment. Rachel's doctor is also missing, having left for his vacation immediately after her escape. That he was allowed to leave is a serious breach of standard operating procedure in a lockdown, yet Ashecliffe's deputy warden and the hospital's Chief of Staff seem unconcerned. There is, too, the mystery of what really goes on at the hospital. Rumor has it that the doctors engage in horrific experimental surgeries, ice pick lobotomies on patients who are not anesthetized. Certainly it is suspicious that the old lighthouse, now allegedly functioning as a sewage treatment plant, is under heavy guard and is wrapped in electrified fencing.<br /><br />Reading Shutter Island, my review of the book writing itself in my head, I was going to say that the story is pretty good, if perhaps unbelievable in parts--the marshal's' mounting paranoia and this forbidding facility where creepy things happen, an island they can't leave until a ferry, delayed by a hurricane, returns for them. The book would, I thought, make a decent movie, perhaps a better movie than it is a book because--and this was my chief complaint--the dialogue between Teddy and Chuck is so terribly clunky.<br /><br />\\"They do it, and it's legal. Only humans get schizophrenia. It doesn't happen to rats or rabbits or cows. So how are you going to test cures for it?\\"<br /><br />\\"On humans.\\"<br /><br />\\"Give that man a cigar.\\"<br /><br />\\"A cigar that's just a cigar, though, right?\\" [groan]<br /><br />Teddy said, \\"If you like.\\"<br /><br />There are, in addition, some unbelievable dream sequences that annoyed me. Nobody talks--or nobody should talk--like Teddy and Chuck do, and nobody has dreams as vivid as Teddy has.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />But then I read the last fifty pages of the book--which went very fast indeed--and I forgave Lehane the dreams and the clunky dialogue because, I now think, they make sense given the plot. It's a good book. And I still think it would make a good movie.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecer /><br />\\"On humans.\\"<br /><br />\\"Give that man a cigar.\\"<br /><br />\\"A cigar that's just a cigar, though, right?\\" [groan]<br /><br />Teddy said, \\"If you like.\\"<br /><br />There are, in addition, some unbelievable dream sequences that annoyed me.

B00005JMFR|4.0|\\"Everything that has a beginning ... Has an end. I see the end coming ... I see the darkness spreading ... I see death ... And you are all that stands in his way.\\"<br />And all that is standing in your way of the most highly anticipated film in years is the massive swarm of people ahead of you. Who would have thought a relatively small film called The Matrix in 1999 would eventually spawn one of the greatest film series in movie history? When the original film grossed $171 million at the domestic box office and became a huge cult favorite on DVD, Warner Brothers quickly jumped at the opportunity to role the (supposedly) final two sequels. It took the Wachowski brothers nearly four years and $300 million but the journey is almost over. There are many questions to ask before seeing Revolutions that one must ask himself: How will it end? Will I understand it? Will everything be answered? Can this truly be the final Matrix film? But the most important question to ask may be the most irrelevant: Do we really want it to end? Surely the Warner Brothers executives know their answer.<BR>The story centers once again on the journey of The One (Neo) as he tries to end the war between man and machine after years of conflict. Revolutions picks up exactly where Reloaded left off earlier this year but here is a recap: <br />Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus lead the human resistance against the machine world for control of the world. For years, the machines have kept human kind plugged into The Matrix, a simulated dream world, and threatened to destroy the last human city known as Zion. Morpheus believes that their journey is almost at an end but there are some that stand in the way of providence. Namely Agent Smith, who was once destroyed by Neo but now has come back to destroy him and everything else. In the final scene of the film, both Neo and Smith (in human form) have been knocked unconscious just as the machines prepare to invade Zion.<br />Got it? If you don't then too bad becausehere we go. Without giving too much away, let's just say everything seems to come full circle. As the humans within Zion prepare to duke it out for control of the world against the machines, Neo goes to the machine city to work out a compromise and stop Smith before it is too late for both man and machine. Did you get confused during Reloaded and hate it for that? Then you're not going to like Revolutions. There is a lot to divulge within the course of the two hour feature and Revolutions will require multiple viewings to unlock all the secrets of The Matrix franchise. Outside of the confusing interlocking concepts, does Revolutions deliver a good plot? Though the beginning starts off a little too slow, the rest of the film smoothes out any rough edges and ends the series with a bang.<br />Most of the cast (outside of a relative few additional members) is the same as it was with The Matrix Reloaded. But in Revolutions, some perform better then others. Keanu Reeves delivers the goods with his role as The One (Neo). Reeves may seem relatively stiff in the film but that is the point. As Smith becomes more and more human, so Neo becomes more and more machine like and acts that way. Reeves does a fabulous job in dragging that point out though many will probably not pick up on that fact. Carrie-Ann Moss takes on the role of Trinity for the final time but isn't as featured as she was in Reloaded, which is both good and bad. The good? The focus of Revolutions is suppose to be on Neo and that is the point. The bad? She has some scenes but not the way many will want her to go out on. The biggest highlight of Revolutions is not the special effects (though they come in a close second) but rather is the performance of Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. Weaving is so over the top with this role that it is just absolutely amazing to watch especially in the final battle sequence between Smith and Neo in the rain. So what is bad? Monica Belluci's Persephone has no point in this film, letalone the entire Matrix series. What does her character do that is of any real importance? Nothing other then bring them the Keymaker in Reloaded but still, what is her purpose? And the biggest disappointment comes from the lack of Morpheus. He is barely shown in the film and deserved more screen time then he got.<br />Overall, Revolutions may not end the franchise in the way everybody would want but the final confrontation between Smith and Neo at the end is worth the price of admission alone. Does the final film answer all the questions? Thankfully, No. Would anybody really be satisfied if all the answers were given to them on a silver platter with no thought put into divulging the film series' secrets for themselves? No. Will multiple viewing be required to fully understand it? Yes but if you don't feel like paying the price of admission then you will only have to wait till at least May for the DVD. Many will leave the theater disappointed and, in certain aspects, they should. Granted, you had to expect that the film would not end with a picture perfect happy ending like you would want but the ending that is given just doesn't serve the film justice. Some fans will feel cheated, some will feel empty, while others will be too blown away from the battle sequences to fully comprehend or care about the real ending. The final scene of the film is one of those either you love or hate kind of things with no area in between. Bottom line is that Revolutions performs better then Reloaded but doesn't end the franchise the way it should have. How will you feel? That is up to you but like the Oracle says in the film, \\"We can't see past the choices we don't understand\\". So grasp the concept of the film before making your final evaluation.
B00007AJF8|1.0|...Mr. John Malkovich didn't object to this using of his name as a title, because it's only the proof he needed that for advertising, which is not any proof of his confidence in his talents (which I'm rating much lower now). As well, or rather as bad, I can't stand any longer the search engines finding 'Spike Jonze' when I'm looking for &quot;Spike Jones&quot; who would have deserved  a thousand times more to be released in DVD (but, of course, crap lovers being innumerable....maybe human beings should now be considered as 'endangered species' and get a little more attention). <br />I can also assure Mr. John Malkovich that I will avoid anything else he's in from now on (I don't even want a glimpse of this one, the title was more than enough: although almost all actors/actresses are known for some nombrilistic tendencies, I'm sorry to see that Mr. Malkovich can put himself on the same level as Madonna)
B00005JMFI|4.0|...The story focuses a larger then usual elf who learns he is actually a human and travels to New York City to find his father. Up at the North Pole, elves are busy getting ready for Christmas but there is one elf that is learning that he doesn't quite fit in. Buddy is not the typical elf, his large size being the biggest factor. He eventually finds out from his adoptive father that he is actually a human that as an orphan baby climbed into Santa's gift bag one Christmas Eve and found his way to Santa's Workshop. After learning his true origin, Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and be part of a real family. But this is easier said then done as his father is a real Scrooge and is prominently found on the naughty list. Buddy, who has never been to the human world, is unfamiliar with many of the things we are accustomed to like revolving doors and food products that don't include sugar. The unusually happy elf must find a way to change his father's workaholic attitude and help his new family find the true Christmas spirit. The story for Elf, though on the predictable side especially as the feature starts to wind down, works surprisingly well. This happens mostly in part to Ferrell's performance but there are also plenty of moments that come off as hilarious even without the lead stars<br />Though the feature doesn't have an exceptionally large cast, the film doesn't have to with some lead characters picking up any slack left over by that. Will Ferrell, who was featured earlier this year in the hit comedy Old School, once again proves he has as much comedic timing and talent as he ever did on Saturday Night Live and probably even more so. Ferrell is able to make Buddy the elf both lovable and hilarious without pushing the personality of the character too far as to make him annoying and pathetic. James Caan, who takes on the role of Buddy's real father, has the grizzly workaholic business man down pat. The only problem lied not with Caan's performance butthe character itself in how quickly the character changed his attitude at the end without really having a change-of-heart experience. And a big highlight came from the performance of legendary comedian Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father. Newhart looks like he had a lot of fun with this role and gives a delightful performance that many will remember despite being only a supporting character rather then a lead.<br />Overall, Elf joins the ranks of such holiday features as The Santa Clause and Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas that shows Hollywood is still able to make a yuletide classic as good as the old days. It's the wonderful atmosphere and Will Ferrell's exuberant performance that makes this film a delightful treat for the whole family can enjoy without one member of the family being alienated by certain material. There are relatively few complaints that can be made about comedy. The only one that is prominent in most minds would be that film tends to be bit predictable at the end of the feature but the filmmakers pull it off so well that many write it off and they should. The slightly-predictable ending shouldn't ruin the overall amusement and delightfulness that the rest of the film presented up to that point. Ferrell's over-the-top performance should be a decisive enough reason to venture to the local movie theater and see Elf but if you are not truly convinced, here may be a better reason: Elf will keep the children busy for an hour and a half while the parents do their Christmas shopping. Smart, huh?!
B00013F35I|4.0|I have been lucky enough to see Bruce Springsteen live twice in Melbourne when he has toured Australia.  The first time was seeing him alone &amp; acoustic after he released The Ghost Of Tom Joad, and the second time was earlier this year on The Rising tour.  This DVD release captures what I saw both times when I saw him live, that is a living rock 'n' roll legend giving it everything he's got, putting every ounce of energy and effort into his performance.<br />I have read about some people having problems with disc 2, but there was nothing wrong with mine so I reckon it must have been a problem with the first releases only that has now been fixed.<br />Yes I agree with some other reviewers that the sound quality on this DVD could have been better, but it's not that bad so don't let it stop you buying it.  It is a great show.<br />I feel far more satisfied with this DVD than the &quot;Essential&quot; compilation released on CD at about the same time.  In my opinion it is this Live DVD that is the &quot;essential&quot; purchase.<br />The Rising is one of my favorite of Bruce's albums and much of the songs in this concert are from that album, but there's also some great older tunes mixed in aswell such as The Promised Land, Thunder Road, Dancing In The Dark, Ramrod &amp; Born In The USA which all sound good, but the high-lights for me are:<br />  1. Spirit In The Night and Incident On 57th Street. (Bruce alone on the piano)<br />  2. Mary's Place. (I thought this was not one of the best tracks on The Rising but it is a great live track)<br />  3. Empty Sky (Played acousticly with Patti singing in the background. I was amazed at how haunting and emotional this song sounded when I heard it live, and whilst I don't think it sounds quite as good on this DVD as when I heard it in Melbourne it goes a long way to capturing that feel)<br />  4. The crowd. (This crowd really gets right into it, and you can see that the fans get to be right up the front, unlike Melbourne where we never had that opportunity because all the corporate fat-cats had preferential prioroty tickets!)<br />The rest of the concert really rocks and Bruce and the E Street Band give what is sadly lacking with many modern artists in this age of carefully crafted formula music, that is a genuine, honest rocking performance delivered with 110% effort from the heart.had that opportunity because all the corporate fat-cats had preferential prioroty tickets!)<br />The rest of the concert really rocks and Bruce and the E Street Band give what is sadly lacking with many modern artists in this age of carefully crafted formula music, that is a genuine, honest rocking performance delivered with 110% effort from the heart.
1587990717|5.0|summary: Debunking fallacies of observation, Taleb reminds us of the pervasive ineffables that complicate life at every turn. <br />Marc Tardiveau writes:<BR>I just finished Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Fooled by Randomness. It is an enjoyable book, written engagingly by an interesting character -- the kind of book that makes you think twice about certain things (for instance, the fact that you're not dead:  is that really because you're so darn good, or does dumb luck play a part?) Although written all the way back in 2001, this book is more relevant than ever, since one of its major topics is the impact of unpredictable events on markets, insurance, and our perception of life in general. In fact, Taleb makes a living from unforeseen events; these days, that seems like a rather cunning niche.<br />The main topic of the book is the fact that all humans are simply terrible at judging probabilities. Taleb is a securities trader, so a lot of the book revolves around financial probabilities, but his argument is mainstream and requires absolutely no knowledge of the markets. The book details examples of people wildly misjudging risks and probabilities in many contexts. Often that misestimation is understandable in advance of certain events, but harder to excuse after they've occurred; Taleb hits pretty hard on what he calls \\"data snoopers,\\" his term for people who back-fit theories to existing data. <br />One of the most notorious examples is the Bible code (which has been thoroughly debunked), but Taleb argues that analysts who spend their time trying to find patterns in historical market data are no different: if you try long enough and hard enough, you will unavoidably find apparent regularities, which can be extremely compelling when seen in isolation. In context, though, they dissolve into nothing but meaningless statistical anomalies. Taleb rightfully compares these searches for meaning to the famous monkeys and typewriters parable. <br />Taleb's best example of poor probability intuition is probably the infamous survivor bias, which is our tendency to be disproportionately impressed by success. We almost always ignore the fact that, for one success story, there are many failures. But we seldom hear about the failures (just like we never hear about the many theories that didn't fit the data). So it's all a game of numbers: out of 10,000 traders, a few are statistically bound to be successful, even if they are nothing more than lucky idiots. The fact that they succeeded does not mean anything. It doesn't mean that they are bad traders, but it doesn't mean that they are good traders either, because on average somebody had to succeed. <br />One of Taleb's hot buttons is that people tend to be too confident in what they know. He argues convincingly that we should take everything, including science, with a grain of salt. Writing about Karl Popper, he points out that there are only two kinds of scientific theories: those that are demonstrably false, and those that are not yet demonstrably false. An irksome (but sadly true) observation, yet most people behave as if what they know is eternal truth. One could of course argue that Popper's observation is but another kind of truth, but I tend to put a lot more trust in people who question what they know than in people who don't. <br />Another of Taleb's peeves is the human tendency to over-attribute every random event (the old post hoc, ergo propter hoc). For instance, a commentator saying that \\"the Dow went down ten points today on concerns about Iraq\\" is talking nonsense: there is no way anyone can tie such a small market move to any particular reason. I found this specific point (which in retrospect is blindingly obvious) especially enlightening, as I am embarrassed to admit that, until now, I just accepted those market comments at face value. <br />Taleb also has some fun at the expense of economists and analysts, especially those whose predictions turned out wrong, but who claim that the theories were in fact right, and that the facts simply weren't supposed to be that way. This is what he calls denial of history, and is common among investors and gamblers (the two being of course close cousins). <br />The style of the book is informal and funny, and often meandering. We hop from one topic to the next, which occasionally may detract from the book's continuity, but overall the author's points come through loud and clear. Ironically for a man who advocates self-doubt, Taleb is starkly self-confident, though not in an irritating way. <br />Taleb is an intriguing, multi-cultural, iconoclastic character that has been around Wall Street for a while, and now runs his own small firm. Malcolm Gladwell (author of The Tipping Point, an absolute must-read for anyone who owns a brain) has written an excellent article that shows how Taleb's reasoning runs counter to just about every bit of conventional Wall Street wisdom. If you're interested in the markets, especially derivatives, and how Taleb trounces most of Wall Street's voodoo doctors, this moderately technical interview from 1996 is worth reading too. <br />Overall, a warmly recommended book.
B00008J4P5|2.0|I know a million people find this record as a breath of fresh rock'n'roll air, but after three records I find the White Stripes are getting insanely old. I'm over The Strokes and I murder anyone who puts The Hives in that same category. I bought this record a little while ago and I've never really gotten into it. I've tried and tried but i just can't. I don't personnaly recommend it to anyone, pick up De Stijl or White Blood Cells, they're definetly worthier of your money. All in all, one word can sum it all up:  Disapointing..
B00005JM02|5.0|This is one of those movies that is perfect for you family movie night.  Our son (9) loves it just as much as my husband and I do.  If your child gets scared easily there are a couple of scenes that might frighten them a little, watch for the shark scenes.  They start out ok, but then the sharks start chasing and it's a bit intense for kids who are easily scared.  My son was ok with it after seeing it a couple of times and learning what to expect though.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney's voice has matured and gained great depth and range. It is in terrific shape!! I have to admit that since I am not into x-mas music (I only know 2 of them), the album needed two listens to grow on me . Without further ado:<br />- The First Noel: When I listened to the sample I thought her voice was a bit airy, but now listening to the real deal, it is in great shape. The song is great, her delivery is great, and the music is good, (A)<br />- The Christmas Song: Great voice, well produced, and I loved the high note (flyyyyyy)... makes me wish for snow!! (A)<BR>- Little Drummer Boy: Bobby Krista.. CUTE!! ... Whitney with all the tenderness in the world &quot;sing baby... that's my baby&quot;.. I liked how the music picked up, and her voice is also in great shape!! (A)<br />- One Wish: The song started good, but then I lost total interest when she hit the chorus,, as several pointed out, the chorus needed some work, nonetheless her voice is very generous and the message is noble (B).<br />- O Holly Night: Faaaaalllll... Oh God the way she hit that note gave me the chills... this should be released as a special single &quot;how to sing&quot; sent to all those &quot;singers&quot; out there.<br />- I'll be home for x-mas: Something about the music I don't like, but otherwise the song sounds good, her voice is good, but I think the rest of the album overshadows this one. (B+).<br />- Deck The Halls/Silent Night: Amazingly, I LOVE this mix!!! Very nice, very energetic, nontheless, Whitney did hit those notes like nobody's business,,, sing it girl! (A)<br />- Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas: Talk about a timeless classic!! Good voice, but I thought the music was a bit loud at parts (i.e. her voice maybe should have been mixed a bit lowder). (A-).<br />- O Come Emanuel: OH MY GOD!! OH MY GOD!! This is the one, Amazing song!! Amazing voice!! and God knows that with no music she sounds legendary!! I loved the vocal runs and the falesto, Very HAUNTING can I add??(A+).<br />Overall: A+!! Great holiday album, I see nonfans enjoying this as I did and probably even more.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|there are three great westerns...Once Upon a Time in the West, The Wild Bunch and Shane (only because Jack Palance was great as the hired gun)...Leone was a true story teller and even though a lot of people find his movies overlong or confusing..Leone still delivers a masterpiece...Fonda as the villian was an inspired casting decision and Robards is great as the likable outlaw with a sense of morals..as for Bronson..what can you say..always underrated he is the linchpin that keeps the movie going

B0000C7PSW|4.0|A newly clean and sober Rufus Wainwright meets Manhattan and comes out swinging. That he keeps getting better and better is amazing to me. It is beautiful and captivating to see how much Rufus has matured between this album and his previous. There is nothing on \\"Want One\\" to match the introspective grace of the previous album's title track, but the first two songs here (\\"Oh What A World\\" and \\"I Don't Know What It Takes\\") had me all but swooning in joy. This is majestic popular music made by a human being, taking the time to both grow artistically and grow up.<br />Like Elton or Brian Wilson, Rufus also enjoys the grandiose overstatement. This album is far more direct musically than \\"Poses\\" (caveat inserted, I really thought his first record was too undisciplined to rate more than the coming of a promising artist). Nowhere is that more in evidence than \\"Want One's\\" centerpiece \\"Go Or Go Ahead.\\" Electric and poetic, it builds and crescendos into six and a half minutes of pop opera that would do Brian Wilson proud, and yet makes me wonder if Rufus had been allowed to go for the double album he wanted, if this would have been his \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\\" The variety is certainly in evidence, be it the lush pop of \\"Harvester Of Hearts\\" or to attempt a serious lyric like \\"11:11\\" and its juxtaposition of 9/11 and the fragility of love.<br />Rufus is also a troubadour in the great and rare tradition of Harry Nillson or possibly John Prine. If I had the space I'd list all the comparisons, but both the songs about Rufus' relationships with his family and parents (\\"Want\\" and \\"Dinner at Eight\\") come straight from the same ink/gene pool that would compose a song like \\"Hello In There.\\" The David and Goliath conflict that opens the imagery of the father/son conflict for \\"Dinner at Eight\\" set among the wonderful orchestration closes \\"Want One\\" on such a gorgeous note that I eagerly await the coming \\"Want Two.\\"
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Before the cd came out I was a little scared that The Strokes would do something to make a crummy cd. Well when it came out, I was impressed, until I noticed a lot of the tracks are much shorter then in Is This It. It really got me mad at first, but when you listen to the songs, they feels complete, unlike some short songs. When I say short songs, I mean over the two minute marker. Also their new cd sound similar to their first one, but what is there to change? You might say, &quot;Is this better or worse then their first cd?&quot; Well, it is kind of hard to say, I really have no favorite. They are both great cds.
B000058983|5.0|There are some CDs you hear about as being masterworks, but overlooked during their time. Love's 1967 masterpiece &quot;Forever Changes&quot; is one of those albums. It is impossibly wonderful, but its gorgeous orchestral folk was overlooked at its release and the band duly disbanded. The liner notes state that had the band not been so lethargic and toured its music, they would have been much bigger and this album wouldn't be so overlooked. However, it truly is an acid test for people: an overlooked, but hugely hyped album can be a risky pick, but once you buy it, it all makes sense. I put buying this album off for far too long, and others must not follow my example.

6305971145|5.0|This movie got terrible critic reviews, but the user reviews are what really matter.  People just love this movie.  My dad bought it for me on LaserDisc back when it was first released in '85, and nearly 20 years later I still love it.  It's a wonderful story and I think the characters are brilliant.  The music is spectacular and I can always seem to replay it in my head.  If you have young children, I guarantee you that they will love this movie and keep loving it.  Watch it with them.  If you don't like the movie that's fine, but I guarantee you'll love watching it with your children.
B00005Y7L4|3.0|This movie is akin to \\"Running Man\\" or perhaps, a more violent version of virtual reality show, \\"Survivors\\".  It is taken place in a futuristic Japan, where high rate of unemployment & social imbalance caused a deep distrust of the old towards the young.  Thus, the creation of a BR Act (Battle Royale Act), where a random lottery was held to nominate an unfortunate & unknowing class to fight & kill each other off until there was only one remaining.  Students had no other alternative as they were given a deadline of three days.  If no winner was declared, then, the survivors would be killed off anyway through the mean of an explosive collar that was attached to their necks.  In order to spice up the event, there would be willing participants who were in the game for the sake of killing.  As the movie progressed, we would see students killed one another with weapons allocated.  They were split into their own groups & along the way, we would see suspicion formed, & some would stick with their mates till the very end.  Some knew that they wouldn't live through to the next day and they would reveal their inner feelings towards their opposite sex and some would do the unthinkable by sacrificing their own lives to save the ones that they were in love or infatuated with.  Beat Kitano was the teacher in this movie & he played a very brief role.  Still, he added weight & dark humour to this movie.  All the time, we were reminded of the incredulity of the movie by having classical music that went together with the killing.  Surrealism at its fullest.  In the end, the message of the day would be love and true friendships that saved the day.  Perhaps, I see too much in this movie but I would like to think that the Director tries to convey the dysfunctional Japan that it is gradually becoming or just maybe, he's simply paying homage to the Manga culture of Japan.  The blood in this movie is very much akin to \\"Kill Bill\\" version, that is in abundance and flourishing like a water fountain.  Quite a surreal spectacle and intriguing to watch.
B00005NGZX|5.0|I can remember a time before 1996's \\"Petitioning The Empty Sky\\" when Converge was well liked in certain circles but not yet the newest band in the hardcore/metal scene to be beloved by all. Upon the arrival of \\"Petitioning\\", Converge from being \\"the best kept secret\\" to everyone's new favorite band. Converge was one of the original bands to inject metal with what the kids refer to as \\"emo\\" and in the process, got just about everyone on board. Converge shows became gatherings where people that avoided other hardcore shows in droves would anxiously await the opening riff right along with the metal mainstays. Since \\"Petitioning\\", Converge retained some of the initial elements but also seemed to be chasing something's tail. With \\"When Forever Comes Crashing\\", they seemed to be having difficulty embellishing on their prior efforts and almost appeared to be making attempts at copying others. The next few subsequential releases also seemed as such. \\"Jane Doe\\" eventually came along to set the train firmly back on the tracks.<br />My best guess for these apparent \\"missteps\\" (depending on who you ask) would be the constant rotation of new members. Whether they simply stumbled upon the right lineup or if it was planned well, Jane Doe is the giant leap forward that, at least I, have been desperately yearning since the awesome \\"Petitioning\\".<br />\\"Jane Doe\\" is a perfect balance of brutal riffing, technical fretwork, aggressive approach and solid songwriting. Right from the first note, it revs for a moment and races at you at hyper speed. Everything about this record is wholly impressive and leaves you with chills. Some of the best drumming Converge has ever offered up is to be found within these songs. Seemingly, the pounding double bass delivery of release's past was replaced with more time changing and intricacies.<br />If you ever found Converge compelling at any point, you would be sorry to ignore this release. \\"Jane Doe\\" seems to have finally put Converge into a place where they have found their own voice that makes them stand out from the bands that they may have been subconciously trying to mimic and propels them light years ahead of their own copycats.they have found their own voice that makes them stand out from the bands that they may have been subconciously trying to mimic and propels them light years ahead of their own copycats.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|This is not so much a review as it is telling you Beatles 'Let it Be' fans what I did to reconcile the old 'LIB' and the new.  <br />Before I tell you what I did (which anyone with a CD burner and certain MP3 creating programs, or a MiniDisc recorder, can do yourselves), I will say that I was neither enthralled nor disappointed with 'Naked'.  Since all the songs on it I've heard for 30-odd years I can't get that excited about any new versions of &quot;Dig a Pony&quot; or &quot;I Me Mine&quot;, much less a classic like &quot;Let it Be&quot;.  I bought 'Naked' on the day of release simply out of Beatle necessity, to have the whole collection, to fulfill my curiosity...heck, it's the bloody Beatles, shut up!  <BR>Overall, it sounds to me like an approximation of what they would have released in 1969/70 if they believed their fans could handle raw, underproduced music.  But of course as the story goes, John and George gave Phil Spector the tapes (with or without Paul and Ringo's blessing or input, I wonder), and made something of them, and in my view did a damn good job with what he was given.   Fast forward to 2003, we are given Let it Be ... Naked &quot;as it was meant to be&quot; (a/k/a as McCartney feels it was, most likely).  I suggest to any Beatles fan who has the curiosity to hear the differences to get it, especially if you're a diehard and happen to want as many variations of their songs.  We now have four possible &quot;Across the Universe&quot;s, &quot;Let it Be&quot;s and &quot;Get Back&quot;s (PM II, Let it Be, Anthology 3, LIB...Naked) to pick from.   The &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; pastiche is interesting, but I'm sure it won't be in heavy rotation by many.<br />Now to get to what I did ... Realizing that 'Naked' omits &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; and &quot;Dig It&quot; and all the extra asides, snippets and dialog from the tracks, which are missed, I thought to myself, how can I have a 'Let it Be' album with the newly undressed versions but restore 'queen says no to pot smoking FBI members' right before &quot;For You Blue&quot;?  Plus want to keep the running order the way you remembered it for 30+ years?<br />This is where my Sony MiniDisc recorder came in handy.  The MD recorder has what's called 'A-B' erase, which can very finely, to the microsecond, edit out part of a track; it also can 'combine' or 'divide' tracks to create new tracks that didn't exist from your CD.  Doing this audio surgery procedure, I was able to sequence 'Naked' tracks in the 1970 order (putting &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; last, as an ad hoc 'bonus track' for lack of a better term), then put &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; as tracks 5 and 7 respectively.  Then for the real fun - splicing in, from the original 'Let it Be' CD,  'I dig a pygmy...gets her oats' to perfectly synch with the beginning of the 'Naked' &quot;Two of Us&quot;, the intro and outro of &quot;Dig a Pony&quot;, the outros from &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot; and &quot;One After 909&quot; and especially 'pass the audition' from &quot;Get Back&quot;.  If you have the patience, you can create your very own 'Let it Be' album and delight your Beatle fan friends with your audio surgical expertise!<br />For you Pink Floyd fans who would like your &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; to go on for its full 24-minute length, not in their traditional Parts I-V, and VI - IX formats, you can do the same thing with SOYCD and create something that neither Columbia not EMI ever thought to release.<br />If you take special care to record both old and new LIB's at the same volume and find the exact points where you can drop then, you can in effect have your Let it Be new cake and restore the icing, in a way.  If you don't have a MiniDisc but have MP3 burning/ripping software that will let you truncate and edit your MP3's you can do it with your PC and get the same results.<br />Since MD's and CD-R's can fit 80 minutes of music, after you're done with my suggested Let it Be, youcan make your own '&quot;Anthology&quot; Let it Be' right afterwards on the same disc, using the Ant-3 versions of &quot;Two of Us&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot; etc, the Ant-2 'Across the Universe&quot; and the Ant-1 &quot;One After 909&quot; just for a whole different listening experience, if you're so inclined.<br />Yes, it's not the 'Get Back' sessions some of you pine for with 'Suzy Parker' or 'Commonwealth' or the hours of outtakes that still have yet to be released, if ever.  But for those of you who have to have your Let it Be with the extra bits that were shaved off and are OK with the 'Naked' versions, this is about the best idea I came up with to achieve that.<br />When they release the catalog on SACD, that would make us all run out and buy them all over again I bet! (Plus an SACD player of course).  I suspect that before that, they might release an album called '2' or '1.5', some sort of follow-up to '1' which will have 'not number ones, but big hits' like Michelle, I Am the Walrus, Back in the USSR, and the omitted #1 from '1',  Please Please Me.   Show of hands, how many of you would buy that, despite having all its prospective tracks in quaduplicate?

0688062334|5.0|Why is this not a review but a preview?  Because I hove not read this book.  So why am I doing this?  Easy, I want everyone else who may be wary of reading this book to know this fact:  Howl's Moving Castle WILL DEFINIATELY be made into a movie by the master of fantastic animation, Hayao Miyazaki, in 2004.  Yes, Miyazaki-San has decided to use yet another of Dianne Wynne Jones tales of fantasy and creativity as the basis for his 2004 movie project, the previous book was Castle In The Sky: Laputa.  Whether this will be the second release to debut in both Japan and American is unknown at this point, but rumors as surfacing after the already Oscar hopeful animated film \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" (Dir. Satoshi Kon, sonypictures.com/movies/tokyogodfathers/) is set to be released in both Japan AND American on December 29, 2003.  I can already tell you that the man who brought you such brillent pieces of cinema such as My Neighbor Totoro, Castle In The Sky, Princess Mononoke, and the Oscar winning Spirited Away and who is one of the top selling authors of ALL TIME with his gut-renching and utterly beautiful masterpiece, Nausicaa; Valley of the Wind, it's a sure thing that this will be one the things that, like in the past, whenever he places his hands upon it will become instant gold.  A brief preview for Howl's Moving Castle is already being circulated throughout the internet on both Japanese and English language websites, so please do check it out.  Oh yea, go see Tokyo Godfathers as well, trust me....
0061015725|2.0|A really good novel illustrating the potential danger of nanotechnology would be a welcome addition.  Prey is not that novel.<br />Here's the plot: Somewhere in the Nevada desert, a hi-tech corporation has been experimenting with nanotechnology swarms.  Of course, the little critters get loose and begin evolving into fierce predators.  Jack Foreman, an expert in designing computer programs that mimic the behavior of swarming animals, is called in to deal with the swarm.  Jack's wife is a Vice-President at the firm, but she hasn't clued Jack into the big picture.<br />I won't give it away, but the swarm evolves so rapidly - and unbelievably - it's difficult to sustain belief in the storyline.  Actually, it's impossible.  Adding to the disappointment are B-movie characters that blur into the background, their tracks sinking out of sight in the sand of a sluggish plot.
B0000DIXRU|4.0|I have do admit, when i first listen to this album, I felt a bit disapointet, the songs all seemed soft and long. It was not the Anathema record I have waited for. But my own excpertations was on another level, I have waited for a harder sound on this record than was delivered from them. This is a &quot;new&quot; Anathema, new sound. They haven`t forgot their roots and influences but they have come much more melancolic, deeper and it`s a rare quietness in the sound. Mellow. But it shows that this band has grown to another level and their destination it`s not set. They use all their old material and turn it in to something new and fine. They have got back to the sound that they have on judgment, not so fuzzy it`s on ...Exit. It`s more like you have enterd a quiet rom there a old man sitting telling mellow stories about life, tradgedy, feelings and reflections. It`s not easy listening, it`s take time to get there and it`s a record you come truly with on the first couple of times you listen to it. But it`s grows and getting more undrstandebal after some listening. The guitar is more clear sounded on this album, except on som tracks ther is  slide guitar and some fuzzy guitar, but not like ... Exit , ther it was fuzzy guitars all over the album. Mellow singing except on two thousand meters a second but that song is about panic, fear and hysteria out of control, so the sound and singing reflecs that. It`s the hardest song on the record.The song A natural disaster i singed by a woman, and maybe it`s reflecs that is Mother nature who speak to us. A fine mellow melodie with some gothic influences, great guitar playing with good harmonies. On ...Exit the theme was  the whole rcord, a long storie. In this record each song tells a different storie.It  took some time to understand this album, but now i hear new details in it everytime I listen to it. And I think it shows what a great record this really is.
1573229725|5.0|This gay Dickensian novel has it all---orphans, pickpockets (i.e.,fingersmiths), villians, switched identities,and heroes (or rather heroines).Not to mention love,romance and delicious moments upon featherbeds.  Ms Waters delights in inserting modern homosexual slang just to tease the reader. And we find out that in Victorian England,\\"to be gay\\" means to engage in an act of prostituion---to pick up a trick.  This tale also serves as a cautionary narrative about bibliophilia, as the plot revolves around the compilation of a monumental collection of pornographic literature. This element of the story is  bibliomaniac's delight.
B00009L1TA|2.0|This film spins around and around and around.... First its a murder mystery, then its a conspiracy thriller then its a psychological thriller then it turns into something else entirely at the end.<br />The producers of this goofy film forgot the basics of filming mysteries: audiences enjoy them more if you actually give them clues and offer up logical plot twists. This mess does'nt do any of that.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Ok, each time this girl comes out with a new album, she shows the world more and more what a fake talent she is. Unlike Christina, she gets the hype and it shows esp. with that fake kiss with madonna and in the end, Britney just goes on the sell out path. Yeah she can she dance TO A POINT but the girl can't sing. Every time I hear &quot; Me against the Music,&quot; and hear the words in the zone, reminds me of the stupid Auto Zone commerical on TV. As the weeks go by, Britney's album and Single, are dropping off the billboard chart, and people with real talent, such as Toby Keith and Alicia Keys are selling music. I say don't waste your dime on this hooker/stripper and go buy the new Outkast's album, Speakerboxx, Alicia Keys' new one but not this album unless you want an expensive frisbee
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is funny, it's tragic and there are moments when it's funny and tragic at the same time (and how often can tv come up with a combination like that and make it work?). The dialogue cracles, and the actors make the most of their given words and the silences in between. These characters stay with you. The science fiction and western genres aren't supposed to go together but somehow they do. This series is wonderful, so naturally it got cancelled. Which is a great shame because this is a show that deserved - deserves - the chance to live on and let its many stories unfold. Definitely a quality series all round.
0425152251|5.0|I have to say, I was extremely surprised to see the first public review on this page was someone saying this book was merely an excersize in the author convincing himself that the &quot;intro to philosophy&quot; course he took was money well spent.  Gaarder contributed to numerous philosophy textbooks before becoming a philosophy teacher himself, so his understanding of the material is not &quot;minimal&quot; in the least. <br />Gaarder's mix of philosophical pedagogy and fictional narrative is as facinating as they come.  A great read for those who have a burgeoning interest in philosophy and a fun diversion for those who have studied it at length.

B00003CXI1|1.0|For me the Harry Potter movie was pretty good, but the DVD was horriblE! The only good special features were deleted scenes, which took me a long time to find.

B00008A7QK|5.0|After Bolan decided to 'plug in' (ironic considering everyone has been frantically 'un-plugging' since), he produced this masterpiece which still sounds fresh and imaginative today. In my opinion, he was more of a traditional rock'n'roller, granted with a touch of Tolkeinism, than a glam rocker, the sparkly stuff only being applied to appeal to the androgynous youth of that period.<BR>Whatever - although his image remains iconic his music always appeared to come from the heart both on stage and in the studio as his ego worked both for and against him. When he finally did start believing his own press, and who could blame him, some of the spontaneity of this period left him, never to return before his tragic end. Bloody superb.
B0000035GN|3.0|This is my second Sebadoh album. My first was &quot;III.&quot;<br />I actually owned &quot;III&quot; for a very long time before even liking it. It's not like I hated it in the first place; I just sort of disregarded it for some completely dumb and idiotic reason. A few weeks ago, however, I actually blew the dust off of the disc and placed it in my CD player. It was incredible, nearly perfect. Lo-fi at it's best.<br />I am assuming it is, with this album, where Sebadoh made the transition from lo-fi to medium-fi (is there such an expression?). While they do a good job, playing catchy music that gradually grows on you, not much of it is all that compelling (musically). Lyrically, Barlow is probably at his peak -- especially in songs like &quot;Not a Friend&quot; and &quot;License to Confuse.&quot;<br />But what's with the radio friendly production? It doesn't sound or feel intimate anymore... you know what I mean? When I listen to &quot;Hassle&quot; or &quot;Kath&quot; from the album &quot;III,&quot; I feel like Lou really means what he's saying, and the low-fi production emphasizes the feelings in both the music and the lyrics. It has a certain charm, too -- the vocals would waver and occassionally go off-key, the music sounded rough but just lovely at the same time. Almost all of that is gone on this record.<br />Not that there's no good songs -- there's almost a good enough amount to warrant a purchase. &quot;Temptation Tide&quot; (the sole song by drummer Bob Fay) uses the shiny production in the best way possible; it sounds dream-like and ends way too quickly. &quot;Not a Friend&quot; is probably the closest this album comes to a Barlow &quot;III&quot;-ish masterpiece. &quot;Got It&quot; is incredibly catchy, with a guitar line that is really infectious.<br />And there is, of course, &quot;Skull.&quot; I sort of have a love/hate thing with this song -- it's really pretty, and well made to boot, but the chorus is simply ... uninspired. It was the one song on here that got any radio airplay, and it's easy to see why -- it's the most mainstream-ish song on the record. It's a good song, regardless; not great, but good.<br />Eric Gaffney, who, in my opinion, was as good as Barlow in the songwriting department, is notably absent here. And it shows. I've read somewhere that he left in 1993, a year prior to the release of this. Which is unfortunate; I miss him and his wonderful songs. Whereas Barlow wrote quiet (albiet beatiful) confessions, Gaffney wrote some really messed up tunes. They were loud, scary (sometimes not), and incredibly interesting. &quot;As the World Dies, the Eyes of God Grow Bigger&quot; (from &quot;III&quot;) is one of my favorite songs, ever. It has an incredible story (the lyrics are nothing short of spectacular) and, musically, the flip-flopping between jangly guitar pop and heavy metal is simply infectious. You must hear it if you haven't yet.<br />Without Gaffney, &quot;Bakesale&quot; is almost a one-note affair; the songs are mostly mid-tempo, and none really distinct from one another (save for a few). Like I said before, though, it does grow on you. There are no standouts, but there are no bad songs either.<br />I think that if &quot;III&quot; (or anything else before this) had never been released, and Sebadoh debuted with this record instead, my perception of it would of been entirely different. I would of liked it a lot more.<br />But I just can't help but make dumb comparisons. Sorry.

B000062YAZ|5.0|If anyone, Slayer has to be, undoubtedly the definitive band in thrash metal. From the years of 1983, when such bands as Metallica and Queensrÿche also debuted, Slayer, unlike the other bands, is still making good music (just pick up either Metallica's &quot;St. Anger&quot; or Queensrÿche's &quot;Tribe&quot; and you will see how their music has changed). Reign In Blood is an example and a history lesson of what may be Slayer's best album ever. Every song is non-stop aggressive, upbeat and mean thrash metal at it's best. From the onslaught of the dual guitars to the pounding of the double kick drum, this one is great. <br />This recent fall, I saw Slayer in concert at the Mid Hudson Civic Center, and they hold together live faster and better than many bands wish they could. Not only did they come up with a 2-hour set, but after about the first 8-10 songs, Slayer's finale was, well, Reign In Blood. They played the entire album from start to finish, from Angel Of Death to Raining Blood, all in order. Damn, I guess that means that they like this album a little bit too. Well anyway here's the breakdown of it all.<br />Angel Of Death - To be brief, this is the best Slayer song ever, no kidding. You just can't get any better than this song. It is not only hyper fast but has a sick breakdown in it too.<BR>Piece By Piece - It's a two minuter. Not bad by any means, in fact it's all well rounded song. This also has one of those good old breakdowns.<BR>Necrophobic - This song wasn't as good as Angel Of Death, but hey, not really any of them are. But it's the general sound of the album here still. Fast and thrash.<BR>Altar Of Sacrifice - This is one mean song. I love how Kerry and Jeff just abuse the whammy bar beyond belief! It's got a slow and heavy bridge. It bleeds right into the next song. 'Kin great.<BR>Jesus Saves - This was the first song on the album where you realize that it doesn't start off at 100 miles per hour. But things change quickly and it picks up in the first minute. Also a killer.<BR>Criminally Insane - You really get a taste of what Tom Araya loves to write his lyrics about. It's a slow song compared to the rest but it's also one of the best. Since it's slow it's pretty heavy.<BR>Reborn - This is about the only moderate song on the album. It's pretty good but nothing spectacular.<BR>Epidemic - It kicks off with one of those signature Slayer drum rolls. Pretty fast like, everything and well yeah it's good.<BR>Postmortem - This song sounds like it's way out of it's time, like some band wrote it only a couple years ago. I wonder what people thought in 1986 when a song like this was around. Another one that bleeds right into the next...<BR>RAINING BLOOD - This is Slayer's meanest, crudest, songs of destruction and violence ever!! You have to listen to it to understand. From the intro to the main killing riff to the, whole song it's just one of the best.<br />The absolute best songs on the album are Angel Of Death and Raining Blood. This album is home to two of Slayer's best songs to date, with the rest of the album rocking more probably than any other Slayer release.
0345409671|3.0|A small note, this book to me, should really be called:  The Bible According to Anne Rice....but I'll put that opinion aside for now....<br />The 1995 book, Memnoch the Devil starts off in New York City where Lestat is stalking a drug dealer named Roger and ends up killing him but starts to become obsessed with Roger's televangelist daughter, Dora after he kills him.  Unbeknownst to Lestat a man starts stalking him and turns out to be named Memnoch who claims that he's the Devil or his he?  He asks for Lestat to be his right hand man in Hell and tries to persuade him by taking him through a journey through time and between Heaven and Hell so that Lestat can decide which side he would serve.<br />First off, be warned that you're going to either like or hate this book.  This book was unusual in that I kept going back and forth on my position of the book as to whether I liked it or didn't like it and my end verdict is that it depends on what your expectations are.  <br />If you are of the type that likes delving into a different, yet controversial perspective of God, the Creation, and the like you will like this book.  There are numerous and thoughtful debates on how much a person must be worthy or sinful to be saved or damned, the validity of the construct of Christianity, and the whole meaning of God's progress and plan for angels and humans.<br />The subject of not being a valid vampire chronicle aside, you would not like this book if you are deeply offended at an unorthodox view of the Christian religion in general.  God sometimes is portrayed in a negative light for some of the book and Memnoch is portrayed in a positive light for some of the book.  There are also what some people would think are graphically offensive parts such as Lestat drinking  from Christ's blood (LITERALLY) and also some menstural blood from a woman in a nausiating description.  <br />By all means, I would NOT consider this a valid vampire chronicle.  At least 95% of this book is not even focused on the theme of vampires.  The person that Memnoch selected to come with him didn't have to be a vampire and could've been a regular human.  Most characters are neglected and are in a theological tone that no characters except Lestat actually progress in character in the series.  Don't read this book expecting an exciting contemporary vampire adventure because some of this story can be a little monotonous.  However, I wouldn't skip this book as that Lestat's personality drastically changes in some ways in later books due to this one.<br />One final note.  Remember, the naration of Memnoch and the debates discussed in this book are FICTION.  This is not the official view of the Bible so don't let this confuse those of you who are weak minded Christians out there as some of this story can seem creepily real.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Okay, I know Britney Spears is a super-star pop diva whatever you want to call her. And I know that her CDs have made uber amounts of money and little boys and girls everywhere at some time or another had every single song of hers memorized. But- and this is the truth- even though a couple of her songs are pretty good and get in your head, they are pretty much all the same. And the love songs and ballads that she tries to pull off don't go with her voice, and they end up sounding fake and really shallow. I know that that's kind of harsh, but still, that's the way this CD comes across and I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone that likes the hip hop and pop rock of today.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys is very talented and I'm just coming home from Iraq on my 15 days R&amp;R leave and the first new song I liked since I've been gone for a year is&quot; You Don't Know My Name&quot; By Alicia Keys I can't wait to get back to Iraq to let everyone hear this because we knew when Alicia came back it was going to be strong and on a up side she can really sing not like Ashanti where she says babybaby so much because she likes how she sounds saying it me and the other females counted how many times she used baby on her cd and we lost track so go Alicia keep being created and doing your thing and all the males think your beautiful they have your poster in the tent.
B000005RYQ|4.0|This is a fun CD, for sure.  The Police may not be musical titans, quite, but everyone can use a few good pop songs, which is about what you'll find here.<br />'Roxanne' is undeniably a classic, and hearing Sting--surely one of the whitest men in pop--trying to affect a Jamaican accent is oddly endearing.  'Message in a Bottle' is very pretty, and 'Can't Stand Losing You,' 'Don't Stand so Close to Me,' and 'Spirits in the Material World' are all perfectly catchy ('Don't Stand...' being the best, clunky and obvious Lolita reference notwithstanding), in spite of the fact that they all have basically the same chorus.  For whatever reason, 'Invisible Sun' perfectly evokes the eighties politial landscape to me, and it's a good song to boot.  Probably my favorite thing here is 'Synchronicity II,' with its genuinely nightmarish lyrics.  The other four Synchronicity tracks are pleasant enough, if perhaps a bit overly slick to quite qualify as great.<br />'So Lonely' is absolutely hideous, on the other hand.  The falsetto yelping may have worked on 'Roxanne,' but here it's just embarassing.  The song has no value whatsoever.  How could it have possibly been released as a single?  'Bed's Too Big Without You' is a little better, but it's not a classic.  And 'De Do whatever' and 'Every Little Thing She Does...' are just kind of vapid.<br />But no matter; there's no particular reason that you shouldn't pick this one up.  And it's preferable to American collections since it has four more songs, only one of which is the most godawful thing ever recorded.   So have fun.

When Buble' was still a relative unknown, we had the pleasure to hear him sing in one of the showrooms on our cruise ship.

Get it, trust me. You'll find a favorite among this collection.
B0000CFW87|5.0|hard to beat the first cd but its been done. The first left me wanting something more and this second gave me more. I still feel more can be done with Josh but why bother i guess when you have a winning situation. AMAZING AGAIN JOSH! glad someone found you and put you out there for us when there is so much garbage bombarding the radio these days
B00005QVHI|5.0|This is the best cd ever! I have never heard anything this good before I bought it. I also got the new Live Rage cd. Thats cool too.
0385335482|5.0|The Shopaholic books are excellant for no-brainer humor and entertainment.  If you feel like reading an amusing series, grab a glass of wine or cola, relax and have fun.  Great easy reading when you just want to have fun and not use your brain cells.  If you enjoyed Bridgett Jones or The Nanny Diaries, you will probably enjoy this one, too.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Johnny Cash was truly one of a kind and nothing proves that as much as this historic concert.
B00004SCX6|1.0|THIS CD HAS NO GOOD SONGS ON IT AND EVERYONE WHO LIKES THIS &quot;STUFF&quot; SHOULD STOP HAVING MTV RUNNING THEIR LIVES AND SHOULD START THINKING FOR THEMSELFS.
B00013F35I|3.0|Do any high quality concerts from the late 70s early 80s time period (prior to Born In The USA) exist on video somewhere? The dead just released a 78 show from Winterland and it's amazing! I'm hoping there is something in the vaults like that somewhere for Springsteen!

If you liked them, you will probably like these, too.
B000000993|5.0|ok, i am gonna say this, nothing will ever amount to tools truth.  nothing.  i dont care what &quot;hardcore speed album&quot; you can find, and i am not bashing metal, or anything, i listen to mainly death metal (malevolent creation, death, incantation, ect)and tool used to be my favorite band, but you know, the gang of people that got me into tool, all just kinda faded away, but tool is so true, and honest, and nothing more nothing less.  u cant really judge them ,or compare them, cause they just do what they do, it all kinda happened by fate, they didnt want to be the raw new thing, it just happened.  so, i call that truth and dedication.  going from living your life, to doing a rock gig, and getting popular, and having 1000 eyes staring judging you.  thats devotion.  all tools cds are good, and honest. but some are a step above others, but still have the same level of commitment.
6305308659|5.0|inventive masterpiece. wow. i was pleasently surprised.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Truely one of the best sequals out there. A big thumbs up the Brian Singer for taking the X-Men serious and making a great series. Nightcrawler was amazing and the speical effects were right on target, not too big, not too small. Let's hope for a Wolverine spin-off!!!!
B00005QIPH|4.0|There is one thig I have realised from reading some of the comments made... that is that people either love this band, or they hate it. <br />OK, so the do sound a bit like something the Velvet underground would have done, but all artits take influence from other bands, I mean, sometimes bands are named as being influenced by some band, Radiohead many times have been marked as being Pink Floyd-ish. <br />I am a guitarist, I know that you may say that the riffs are to simple and are similar to other ones, so what? Just because they are not ripping through a Hendrix like solo does not make them bad, does it? I mean some Beatles songs were very very simple to play and you dont see anyone bithing about them!<br />The bass lines however are virtual copies of other bands... even the bassits has admitted in an interwiev I read in guitar world, that he copied many of them from Motely Crue songs. That basicly takes some merit away from the band, but even Nirvanas Smells like teen spirit borrowes the main chords from a Boston song. <br />The Hype- yes the stokes are very hyped specialy by high school kids and rocker wannabees, this at times can be very anoying, but why dont you just forget about the whole hype and just listen to a good band.<br />This cd is very good, specially for a first relise. So they copied styles from other bands and mixed them to create a sound they call their own, but you have to ask yourself, its this really a bad thing? The way things are going is very bad, mainstream music is now filled with rap garbage songs, you want to talk about songs without any meaning... What we need is more bands like The Stokes and Kings of Leon to help in the fight.
B0000024K1|5.0|Raising Hell, Straight Outta Compton, Paid In Full, Illmatic,The Score, Criminal Minded, The Chronic, Doggystyle, Are as close as your gonna get...THIS IS HIP HOP'S MOST INFLUENTIAL, GROUNDBREAKING, &amp; MEANINGFUL ALBUM/CD EVER!! I'm a 34 yr. old DJ, grew up with hip-hop (before it was hip-POP) and there's never been anything recorded that compares. HOLLA!
B0000DD7LC|3.0|I'm a staunch believer that growth is the measure of an artist. I was totally behind Alicia Keys on the first album because it was something fresh on the scene. Hell, I was loudly touting the first album when I first got it. Keys is supremely talented but I couldn't help but find Diary a bit of a letdown. Some tracks sounded like reprises from Songs in A Minor (&quot;When You Really Love Someone&quot; comes to mind most strongly) and she seems to have carried Songs's pained-love-from-afar theme over to Diary. Which, admittedly, isn't a terrible thing; it's hard to stay away from love as a theme in general, but sometimes one feels the need to expand beyond certain horizons. She takes some artistic leaps and some of it works--I love the drum-driven feel of &quot;Heartburn&quot; and the strings on &quot;Karma&quot; are just phenomenal to hear--but still the album feels lacking on the whole. It's disappointing that Diary isn't quite as polished as I'd expected it to be, considering Keys is such an impassioned, enthusiastic and incredibly talented artist. It's just that it feels as though she held back to stay on the marketable side, which is always a letdown, but it's especially disappointing coming from such a gifted artist.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|It pains me to even give one star, because this one star is already far too generous a rating.  And it puzzles me greatly why she is still making &quot;music.&quot;  How about learning to sing? Pick up an instrument?  Even be slightly talented?  There are so many other artists out there are far more talented and that actually make noteworthy music, so please open up your ears and don't fall for this artificially-packaged and manufactured trash.  This comment applies to all of her albums, not exclusively to this one, but after hearing this one it became unbearable to not say anything.  <br />So unless you enjoy commiting AUDITORY SUICIDE, please don't waste your money on this or any other of her discs.  Buy something more worthy of your money!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This is the best dark movie I have ever seen for a long time now.. I was really sceptical about underworld at 1st but then after watching it.. I just don't believe what I was looking at. Truly amazing plot, action sequence and characters.. The story develop scene after scene making the viewers sitting tight on their seats craving for more. I absolutely was awe by this awesome movie.. however I truly believe that Underworld is underrated. It should get the credits that it deserved or putting such an excellent movie. I am eagerly waiting for the sequel as I know it would be so much better than the 1st..Underworld RULE!!!! Vampire & Lycan RULE!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Easily the best CD she has ever done.  If you like dance/club music, you will like this.  Not a weak song on the CD, I recommend highly.   I really liked The Hook Up, Early Mornin, and Toxic.
B00005JMCW|5.0|hello lindsay fans<BR>this movie  is realy verry COOOOOOOOL YOU MUST SEE THIS ONE<BR>i love it <BR>greeting from the netherlands<BR>gerben van den bosch
B00005M91K|5.0|wow.  this movie just blew me away.  we watched it in class, and i immediately went to buy it.  baraka is a beautiful movie that describes without words the major issues of the world.  it gets a little scary at times, but that just adds to the wonderfulness of the movie.  i recommend this movie to everyone.  it'll motivate and touch you like no other movie.
B00004SWBD|5.0|Props to Slipknot and Road Runner records. They took an awesome cd that contained  'parental advisory' sticker, and took it off leaving the content of the cd un-alterred. So if you're a kid at home that isn't allowed to buy stickered cd's, but love slipknot, go get the clean versoin of Slipknot's self-titled album. Its an awesome album, and is worth the time of any metal head to check out.
B0000Y2XLA|5.0|This Cd is simply amazing!! A must buy for any fans! Don't Speak is still brilliant!
B000002H8F|5.0|First, I listened to Doolittle. Second, I listened to Surfer Rosa. Third, I listened to Bossanova. I thought after Doolittle, how could the pixies impress me even more after this?Then lightning struck twice more. Surfer Rosa is incredible and breathtaking. Bossanova only took me one listen to dig. Doolittle took a few more as did Surfer Rosa. When you listen to the Pixies, you don't need to listen to any other band. These are 3 deserted island albums. Come to think of it, I think Nirvana was just a Pixies cover band. I think Courtney Love figured they couldn't rip off the Pixies anymore so she shot Kurt in the head. Anyway , get a sense of humor and get a copy of every Pixies album if you're open minded and somewhat smart. No filler on these albums.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Words just can't describe how this (as well as FOTR and TT) soundtrack drives into me emotionally.  The music is so powerful, and even without the movie brings me to tears.<br />'The Steward of Gondor' - what a fantastic surprise to hear Billy Boyd! This by far my favorite track on the album.  The lyrics are heart wrenching, and combined with the melody (and the recorder, I think it is?) as well as Billy's beautiful voice makes it one of the most breathtaking and moving songs I've ever heard.
0385311400|5.0|Great book, well packaged &amp; timely delivery! Thanks!
B0000640SA|5.0|If you are even thinking about buying this movie and are on the fence let me tell you that it is well worth it. I'd have to say that this is one of or possibly *the* greatest movies of recent years (or any year for that matter).<br />This is a puzzle movie, if you prefer to have a plot spoon fed to you and a nice neat round up of events in the final scene that explains it all then continue browsing for something else.<br />Otherwise this is the movie for you... I won't outline the plot as to do so would be to mentally prepare you for what comes next or should that be before :-)<br />This DVD has a hidden easter egg (use google) that allows you to view the movie in the *wrong* order. If you have already seen Memento then this hidden gem makes this DVD worth the price alone.<br />Suffice to say I find myself reaching for this one when I'm bored or looking for a mind work out...repeat viewings are required to fully grasp what the Director had in mind...btw the directors commentary is pretty interesting as well.
6305718903|3.0|A strange film, with a very interesting concept. If you're devoutly religious, then you'll know what the stigmata is. I've never heard of it, and I found I learned quite a lot - what the stigmata's are, where they appear etc. And finding out some cool trivia - every crucifix, whether on a necklace or in a church, is technically 'wrong'. Christ did not have the nails driven through his palms, cos the nails would just rip right through the flesh. Instead, the nails were driven through the wrists, which is more correct. And this is where the marks appear on Patricia Arquette.<br />Who, by the way, is a great actress! Apart from her, I could have seen Cate Blanchett in this role, but Patricia Arquette plays the part of Frankie almost too well. It's very realistic, and you have to remind yourself it's just a film.<br />The beginning credits have some very cool scenes, which is a quick look at what Frankie is like. Her life is full of clubbing, hairdressing, and guys. And she's in no way religious. Kinda obvious what's going to happen, considering the best part of the film is about religion.<br />Some of the scenes featuring flashbacks to the stigmatas/Christ are very realistic and too scary to watch. They happen very abruptly, and in the weirdest places, for no apparent reason. It's almost painful to watch Patricia Arquette act out receiving the stigmatas.<br />I found this film quite good, and learned a bit from it. You can die from having all 5 stigmatas - nails through feet & wrists, the crown of thorns, and finally, the fatal spear through the side. But watch from behind a cushion.
B00005N83M|2.0|What better way to boost off into mainstream happy-land than a duet with Ja Rule automatically becoming a huge radio-friendly smash? Jennifer Lopez is a fine actresse and she shouldve stuck to it just like many actors are trying to do, branch out to music, but fail miserablly. I can't really call Jennifer Lope- err i mean J LO a failure after the millions of copies sold of her album, but it fails to hit the soft spot in hip-hop which it sounded like she was aiming for. Jennifer Lopez never really had any vocal talent to begin with but this album dims her vocals so much more and all thats to pay attention to is the dull beat in every song. But despite of this everyone knows that J Lo will stay a huge household name worldwide...even if she is lacking talent in the music industry, but hey whatever brings in the &quot;rocks&quot;
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Looking through the various reviews of the Firefly DVD set I now own, I see a couple of recurrent patterns.<BR>People (out of currently 188) who gave the DVD set 1 star either:<BR>A.  Maybe saw one or two episodes of the show,<BR>or<BR>B.  Are from California<BR>or<BR>C.  Both<BR>There seem to be several reasons for the failure of the show on TV.  First and foremost, it was on FOX.  Secondly, it was on Friday night (on FOX).  Thirdly, the pilot episode was shown last (!!!)<BR>The pilot was brilliant, and the show kept getting better.<BR>Could it be Fox execs can't count (which is first, episode one or episode two...)?<BR>So instead of introducing the show to the world in a two hour premiere in a decent time slot, and allowing people to see the absolute genius of the show, and also allowing us to get to know the characters in a timely fashion, Fox shows us the second episode, which though still good, is substandard to the pilot.  If all the other shows were a ten, the Train Heist would be a nine.<BR>Why does Fox routinely get rid of actual programming in favor of one cloned, nonsensical, idiotic piece of trash reality show after another?<BR>I think I know, and you may agree:  the people who dream up the reality shows are all stoned, all the time.  <BR>[Dude, okay, this time, we put a bunch of people up in a ranger tower in Canada, we make them get naked, and the first to be voted out of the tower gets cannibalized...and...whoa...what was I sayin'?  Hey don't bogart that bong man, that is not cool...]<BR>My second theory is just as plausible:  Appeal to the lowest common denominator in society and they'll watch, and keep watching, and keep those ratings up and the sponsors happy, otherwise they're taking a risk of losing their largest portion of the audience:  The ones who don't have to think.  Just watch Temptation Island, buy Pepsi, eat Cheetos, go back to sleep, America.<BR>If the movie pans out, I'll be ecstatic.  Until then, buy Firefly, rent it, but watch it because you're not going to get any better than this.  Don't pay attention to anyone who hasn't watched the DVD set or are from California, or both...<BR>Unless of course you don't want thought provoking, interesting and ultimately different from everything on TV (or off TV, as it currently is).<BR>If you don't want or need that, just keep watchin' Fox, I think the OC's still on...
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence has been shifted into mainstream with thier album, \\"Fallen\\" that is nothing like any of the bubble gum/sex yourself up pop and rock out on the charts today. Evanescence is much deeper, dark, and beautiful than any other rock bands. This band emerged itself with the radio friendly, over-played single \\"Bring Me To Life.\\" That song never really appealed to me but when \\"Going Under\\" came out I immeadiatly bought the CD and couldnt stop listening to it. I've read reviews comparing them to Linkin Park and saying they are talentless; obviously they havent REALLY listened to the surreal sounds and enticing vocals by Amy Lee. \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Hello\\" are a refreshing step away from the riffing guitars with Amy Lee's sultry voice accompianed by a piano giving the CD an uplift. Many people don't know what they are talking about when they say \\"overrated\\" because Evanescence is a fresh and original leap from the rock today sounding almost plain compared to Fallen.
B00004Z459|1.0|do you want to listen to something that you hear all the time? Do you wish to escape from original music and listen to something that's been done over several times? You've found it right here in this little package called Hybrid Theory. Not only do you get the teenaged angst, but you get some pretty unoriginal musicians. You can relate this band with another band... Limp Bizkit... but at least Limp Bizkit knows they suck. This album really isn't worth it, the solo done by the mixer pretty much pisses me off, and the song that got me into this album soon shot me down when I heard the rest of the cd. Reanimation was something else that pissed me off. I could just see them now... &quot;Let's go ahead and remix the songs from Hybrid Theory, throw in a few new songs here and there, and call it an album.&quot; Well, it seemed to do well enough because people bought it. It just goes to show that some of us are mindless zombies.<br />In a perfect world, everyone would agree on the same music or they'd have respect for everyone's music taste, no matter how bad it may be.<br />With this type of music, we can never reach that. <br />It takes patience to obtain great skill at music. These guys are as patient as a Porche on a highway.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera has literally built a brick wall between herself now and the bubble-gum pop days exploding her into the overpopulated &quot;pop princess&quot; titles. With her newest album the album speaks to mature people with its title &quot;Stripped&quot;; unlike many others who believe she created the title because of a lack of clothing and innocence. The title means that she is tearing down the barriers between her personal affiars and the rest of the world creating an album more heartfelt than any of her rivals. This album combines soul, hip-hop, rock, latin, dance, and pop creating a daring yet pleasing album. &quot;Walk Away&quot; is an excellent song featuring beautifally composed pianos and the diva voice of Christina's belting out melodies so resonating. &quot;can't Hold Us Down&quot; is a powerful song about female empowerment but fails to reach outside the mainstream boundaries like other songs on the album do. Undeniably the most raw and honest song on the album is, &quot;Im OK&quot; which could make anyone cry with lyrics about her childhood in abuse from her father. This CD really shows off her amazing vocal talents even in fast paced songs. Christina steps away from others opinions about her new image but she is now bieng true to herself even if it is wearing pounds of make-up and revealing attire. Stripped will definitly please just about anyone and her talent shines through on each and every track.
B000003TAW|5.0|I first heard this album when I bought &quot;Green&quot; for my sister.  I decided to get this one as well because it was the first one and though that she would like it.  Almost instantly, she told me that she didn't and so it passed into my possession.  I've never regretted buying it.<BR>From the very first note on &quot;My Name is Jonas&quot; to the very last chord on &quot;Only in Dreams&quot;, this album is truly captivating.  The music is so upbeat and melodic and Rivers puts out some of the best modern solos I've ever heard.  <BR>&quot;The World Has Turned and Left Me Here&quot; is an undeniably heart-wrenching song, while &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; is a sweet and joyful track that remains one of my favourites to this day. <BR>&quot;Surf Wax America&quot; is doubtless one of the catchiest songs I've ever heard. &quot;My buddies and their honeys all come along/they seem invincible as they surf around&quot; is classic!<BR>But by far, my favourite song of all time and in the Weezer world is &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot;.  The powerful guitar, along with the strong lyrics, makes it highly addictive.<BR>I also recommend that you never skip the end of &quot;Only in Dreams&quot;.  Noting that the very last &quot;only in dreams&quot; is the highest point of this song, it has to close out somewhere.  Take the time to listen to the axe clash; it doesn't disappoint.<BR>In the end, I have to say that this CD is the best one in my collection.
6305784078|1.0|I liked this movie when I was little, now I'm 13, and when I recently watched &quot;The Aristocats&quot; I relized how bad and weak it is. The kittens are cute. But the story is, in my opinion, a rip-off of &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; and &quot;101 Dalmations&quot;. The songs are really weak too, and the animation isn't all that great. If you wanna see a great, cute movie about animals, I recommend: &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Bambi&quot;, and &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;. Don't waste your money on this. Sorry Disney.
0140277447|1.0|Iris Chang's &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot; is claiming Japanese troops massacred 300,000 civillians in Nanking.<BR>Most historians' account is around 40,000 Chinese soldiers died in this battle.<BR>According to the Documents of the Nanking Safety Zone by the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone, there were 49 claims for casualities of civillians.<BR>Why don't you wonder if it is possible to kill 300,000 people in 6 weeks by only a pistol and a sword?
B0000CAQ27|2.0|I liked Pink's previous cds but I found Try This to be pretty bland. The songs are all very similar and none of them really stick in your head. It appears as if Pink is trying to move from pop into rock and fails, ending up as neither. I like Pink so I had high expectations of this cd but I was very disappointed. Unless you're a hard core Pink fan, I'd recommend giving this album a miss.
B00004IC9G|4.0|This was the first album by ex-Dictator Ross the Boss' new band. I became disenchanted with Manowar when they became so Serious as to be like a cartoon, but &quot;Battle Hymns&quot; was a terrific debut album. A lot of energy, and some really good songs. &quot;Shell Shock&quot; has some real clever Vietnam-vet lyrics, and &quot;Dark Avenger&quot; features Orson Welles' narration: what could be heavier than that? &quot;Battle Hymn&quot; is the highlight of the album: I don't care much for pump-your-fist-in-the-air anthems, but &quot;Battle Hymn&quot; is different, a great song about courage in battle, and probably would be a classic if it had been heard by more people. I wish the re-release had not re-ordered the songs, though- &quot;Manowar&quot; and &quot;Death Tone&quot; are switched, and I think &quot;Manowar&quot; was a better opening song.
B0000028RR|5.0|You remember back in `92 when you were sitting in your room with GOOD music on the radio? Damn; I bet that makes you feel like a `vet. Remember when a time of good bands existed? Remember when another good band that was different from the other good bands arose? This was it. Rage is one of those bands you can hold onto every hook and beat blasted. Zach's voice attains the highest urgency I have still yet to hear from any other band. This band really felt it's political cause, and spawned bands such as Boysetsfire, and other good bands. And then the crappy ones too. But every crappy band ever came out rooted from a good one (usually). This band is as revolutionary as Refused, and I think it goes without saying that this album, as well as all the others are timeless.
B000002KAT|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long to discover one of the most powerful albums in the last 50 years. For details about it, read some of the well-written, 5 star reviews below.  <br />My only caveat, if you don't appreciate Van Morrison in general you probably won't appreciate this masterpiece.
B000002LRX|5.0|This is arguably FNM's best release. I think they're all gravy, but this one stands out for most.
B0000AFQS0|3.0|Won't get fooled again?....Yeah, I was pretty fooled by this new DVD version of &quot;The Kids Are Alright.&quot; This &quot;Who&quot; Documentry Directed byJeff Stein has very little added to it 25 years  after it originally came out.<BR>The good thing about the re-release is the cleaned up footage and clarity in the audio. The bad thing is that the film doesn't offer much but clips of great performances and chopped up interviews that could have been interesting. The32 page book is short on in-depth information and the tiny photos are a huge dissapointment. The second DVD which reveals the clean up process is alright but not really worth one's money. They could have put complete performances in that one...what a loss.<BR>The last tragedy here is the interview voice over with Director Jeff Stein. Stein never seems to give a straight answer to the simplest question. He rambles and constantly praises Keith and Pete but doesn't articulate on the film scenes, process or motivation. It is the most painfull part of the entire film. trully a horrible voice over! I still purchased it for the rare footage and the great performance of  &quot;Baba O' Riley'&quot; and &quot;Who Are You.&quot;  If you want the actual &quot;Who&quot; I would suggest  &quot;The Who's Maximum R&amp;B video.&quot; It contains complete performances from the rarest  places all in great Stereo sound.  <BR>I guarentee you &quot;won't get fooled again!&quot;
B000002KHH|5.0|GOD! How long has it been since this band has released it's first album? Yet still this album is ALWAYS in my player. Ozzy; you rule: even if you did sell out beyond forgiveness; you deserve to do what you want now. I don't think I need to say much about this; no one track stands out more than the other: they're all shattering.
B000065V41|5.0|i have watched this movie since i was a kid and it still endures in my heart with the same love and happiness. it is a must watch every year as christmas rolls around. one of the best adaptations of charles dickens' a christmas carol in many years. all the favorite muppets are present with a great narration by gonzo as charles dickens and his sidekick rizo the rat provides great side humor throughout the film. if you don't buy this film please rent it, because after you watch it once you will wish you owned it for frequent viewing pleasure year after year.
B000002LEE|5.0|Jane's is the most rockin band and yet still the most experimental at the same time. Perry has a great voice and deffinately knows where his head is at. Despite what anybody said he still managed to deliver the goods, and still does (except not as good as he previously did; ie &quot;Strays&quot;). This album most undoubtedly will never leave your player.
B00005JLEU|4.0|Well, I'd like to start this review by making a parallel beetwen this movie and traditional chinese legends, but I don't know any chinese legends, so I can't really do that. So let's just talk about the film itself.<BR>Spirited Away is sort of an oriental version of Alice in Wonderland (with the major difference that Alice's tears where generally smaller than her face). But at it's core it is about the dreams and courage of children. Most of my friends wouldn't be able to survive a whole day at the strange magic hotel where Chihiro, the protagonist, finds herself after the sun sets and her parents become enourmous, fat pigs. However, not only does she manage to survive she also ends up helping a bunch of people and eventually freeing her parents.<BR>All children are brave, much more so than adults. Maybe that's becouse they have a more optimistic view of the world, or it could just be that they are really stupid.
B00006F83Y|5.0|I don't know the last time I've heard a good band on the radio; I really don't. QOTSA is an exception. You REALLY CANNOT categorize them... REALLY. They are stoner rock, and formed from the ashes of Kyuss (another great band). Their sound is so varied I wouldn't know where to begin. Josh Homme has a great ciggarette burned voice, and so does the bassist and the other singers in the band (this is TRUELY a team effort; if you've seen them live you'd know what I mean.) If you like them you should check out Monster Magnet as well.
0790736918|1.0|the indians show up and the one who is apparently to grab the little girl is obviously a white guy with utterly lame 'indian' makeup on.  I just can't stand this kind of crap.  It's what makes so many of these old westerns unwatchable.  Plus the comic relief 'old guy' is pitiful.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|At first I wasn't as impressed with this as much as their first album, but that was just arrogance on my behalf. If an artist doesn't change he is obsolete, this is simply a maturing sound for them. This guy is (Maynard) has made a name for himself and he knows it. It is evident that The Cure influenced this record greatly. The tracks that really stick out is probably what you will be listening to the least as you listen to this more often. Good job. That's all I'm giving you guys because you already have enough people kissing your ass. BIOTCH! Very good album.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Before buying this CD, my hope for it was that it would be at least as good as his first. Well, it far surpassed all expectations!  The words that first come to mind when listening are &quot;grand&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot;.  It blew me away.  Beautiful!!
B000002H70|5.0|Actually no kid is really gonna read a review of this band because they're outdated, and probably the only way of knowing of them is through the A Perfect Circle mesh with Black Sabbath's &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, South Park and a guest appearence on Blink 182's latest release. This band is the band that kids these days will say they like but don't own any of their records. Smith has a beatiful voice, on top of this he IS the definition of &quot;emo&quot;. His music makes you cry, even if you haven't broken up with your girlfriend or ran over a kitty in the road and deep fried it in your oven for lunch. This album is one of the greatest ever and ISN'T overrated. Kudos.
B000002UEB|5.0|I suppose it's all been said already, but I just wanted to add that there's a lot of music out there which can be used as background. You can have it going while you do something else, and think about something else.<br />But not Operation Mindcrime. When I have this album playing, I may try to do other things, but I always end up thinking about the music. I always end up stopping whatever else I'm doing and listening to it. And I can't say that about my other favourite albums.<br />Operation Mindcrime simply stands above the rest. And anyone who loves this album MUST pick up the Operation LiveCrime DVD of their live performance in NYC. Simply fantastic.
1573301043|4.0|I dont get how anyone can compare celine dion with mariah carey.  Mariah had more talent in her little finger than celine.  Celine is all washed up in the same songs over and over again.  At least Mariah is doing different things and different sounds.  MAriah is a true artist.  Celine dion is just a wannabe.  she cant even speak english right.
B00005JLRT|3.0|There is a lot of merit to Star Trek: Nemesis.  As a fan of the original show, I always approached TNG films with skepticism.  First Contact was, of course, the pinnacle of this series, and I (unlike many ST fans) really enjoyed ST:Generations.  Insurrection was a definite turn for the worse, and I expected little of Nemesis.  Thus, I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed the film, in spite of its many shortcomings.  It's certainly better than Insurrection, for example. <br />The good points: it's pacing and action are fantastic.  Director Baird is a respected action film editor, and the pacing and feel of the film is pitch-perfect.  The performances in TNG have always been uneven - Frakes and Sirtis, for example, cannot match the presence of Patrick Stewart - but the acting is uniformly equal to or better than any of the previous TNG outings.  There are Romulans - everyone loves the Romulans!  Finally, in spite of what others have written, the highlight of the film is the crewmember's death (I won't say whose, in case you haven't seen it) - it is startling in its speed and very effective due to the quick cutting.  The denouement following the death is short, but every bit as effective as Spock's in TWOK.<br />Unfortunately, there are a number of bad points.  As pointed out by others, the story itself is essentially recycled from The Wrath of Khan, and that makes it feel tired and dull.  Worse still, there are logical holes - where does Shinzon find this B-4 prototype of Data? how did the Romulans get Picard's DNA?  what has happened to the Federation head spy to Romulus (Mr. Spock)? why doesn't Troy sense Shinzon's lies? (there is an explanation in the cut scenes, but the actual movie ignores the issue.)  Even more annoying are the glaring and unecessary scientific errors.  I don't mind when Star Trek invents science to explain itself (transporters, shields, etc.), but I really mind it when they make scientific errors for no reason.  The explanation of the Remanweapon is particularly laughable - no electromagnetic radiation could have the properties ascribed to it, it's a physical impossibility.  Likewise, you don't need an android to generate positronic radiation - any idiot with a nuclear reactor (or a particle accelerator) can do that.  And don't get me started on the aftermath of the collision between the Enterprise and the Scimitar!  Newton is rolling in his grave.  The point is, all of these mistakes were unnecessary - B-4's planet was proto-industrial, so positronic radiation would be anomalous anyways; Data's spacewalk could still have been necessary if the two ships were still attached; and there's no reason the Reman weapon had to be &quot;electromagnetic&quot; - it could have been any kind of energy!<br />The average moviegoer is likely to forgive the defects in physics, but less likely to forgive the plot holes.  However, most of these you don't notice while watching the first time, because you're caught up in the action.  It's on reflection afterwards that such thorny issues appear.<br />This DVD is crammed full of extras, and I wonder how they all fit on one disc!  There are some little minidocumentaries that are fun and interesting, cut scenes, etc.  The director's commentary is somewhat dull, but there's some interesting info in there.  All this is stuffed on without (apparently) sacrificing the quality of the feature - it is clean, crisp, and sounds great.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This young artist at the age of 18 released her first album &quot;tidal&quot; leaving so many people stupefied, but with this second one, the reactions (or at least mine) was twice as positive. From the first time i heard this album, i kept playing it over and over again until i had the songs perfectly memorized in my head. It never gets boring. It starts off beautifully and actively with &quot;On the bound&quot; followed by the somewhat satiric track &quot;To Your Love&quot; (great combination). Then comes the single &quot;Limp&quot;, a great great angry song followed by the first slow song on the album (and a great one), &quot;love ridden&quot;. I could go on and on listing all the tracks on the album but i'd have too much to say. &quot;Fast as You Can&quot; is probably the best song on this album and it's nice and up-beat, note this was the first single off of &quot;when the pawn...&quot;. Every song on this album flows beautifully and is a pleasure to listen to over and over again. I really never got tired of listening to it. If you're interested in this album i reccomend you buy Fiona Apple's first album &quot;Tidal&quot; first, or give it a listen, so you can see the difference and also appreciate how wonderful her first work was too.
B00005JMFO|5.0|I am not sure what the British equivalent of throwing in everything including the kitchen sink would be, but that would certainly apply to the romantic marathon that Richard Curtis has put together for this holiday season.  Curtis has previously written the screenplays for &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; and &quot;Notting Hill,&quot; along with the adaptation of &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary,&quot; along with a slew of &quot;Blackadder&quot; and &quot;Bean&quot; scripts (which explains the choice bits for Rowan Atkinson).  With &quot;Love Actually&quot; (is all around, is the rest of the title we see in the opening credits) Curtis tries his hand as director as well and apparently gives himself permission to work in every idea for a plot that he had come up with recently.  I have seen several descriptions of this film talking about their being eight couples, but there are at least nine plots lines which collide with each other in various ways at various points in the film.  All of them have them moments and it will be interesting for couples who see this film to pick and choose which three story lines they like the best.<br /><br />Curtis sets the range of tone for this film in the first two sequences.  During the title credits Hugh Grant makes a poignant comment about September 11th that evokes an emotional response from many audience members and then we are confronted with the spectacle of over aged rocker Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) turning a familiar song into a holiday exploitation number.  The laughter outweighs the tears in what follows over the next 135 minutes, but there are ample opportunities for both (I had no idea the film was that long, I was too busy enjoying it).  Curtis juggles all the plotlines effortlessly, buoyed by the fact that all of them are interesting and we have a strong rooting interest in several of them as we follow them through the four weeks before Christmas.  However, do not be fooled into thinking that everybody gets a happy ending, because that is not the case, whether they deserve it or not.  Still, there are enough endings to go around (maybe even more than &quot;The Return of the King&quot;), and it is good to remember that sometimes the triumph of love is a peck on the cheek.<br />There seems little reason to review the plot lines, because there are just so many, and no need to tell you which parts were my favorite because you should make up your own mind.  The cast alone should be enough to get your interested in this one.  I commented that it had three of the four leads from &quot;Sense and Sensibility,&quot; only to see the fourth one pop up (sort of).  True, I have trouble believing Hugh Grant is the Prime Minister of England, but that is a minor concern.  Mostly it is the relative newcomers that standout, including Andrew Lincoln as Mark, Martine McCutcheon as Natalie, and Thomas Sangster as Sam.  Another fun part of this film is all the recognizable faces who pop up at interesting moments (you will need the fingers on both hands to count them).  Be forewarned that this is a British comedy, which means naked bodies are usually funny rather than sexy, which is a shame only because there are parts in this film kids would like but their parents will not let them see because of the other parts.  Also, be prepared to stop at a store on the way home to pick up the soundtrack, because the music is a big part of this film and you have to find a way to get Billy Mack's song out of your mind.<br />I can also tell you that my wife laughed louder and cried more often than at any movie we have ever seen.  In fact, I was told I had to get the DVD for her for Christmas, so stick a fork in me, because I am done.  On the other hand, on the other side of the two bridges I can see from our windows is Wisconsin...because that is not the case, whether they deserve it or not.

B00005JMTQ|4.0|This  movie is great for its performances... I'm sure it will one day be considered a classic due to the cast. Nancy Meyer's direction is always stylized and classy, and she steers away from cheesy a bit better than she did in from What Women Want, but her writing needs tightening. Some scenes played too long and others were dialogue redundant. Like most films made today, they could greatly improve with a script editor. This becomes all too apparent in the second half of the film. Also, the \\"Hamptons\\" and that whole set is a little nauseating, and the film ends on a lackluster note with an anemic Paul Simon song that doesn't fit with the \\"classics\\" score. Having said all that, I wish there were more films like this, great stars in simple stories with funny and romantic moments.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Lightning struck again today as we once again stopped on the way home from a movie to pick up the soundtrack album.  The first time was for &quot;Freaky Friday,&quot; and tonight it was for &quot;Love Actually,&quot; the holiday romantic comedy from writer-director Richard Curtis.  The main reason of course is because we have to have a copy of Bill Nighy singing &quot;Christmas Is All Around&quot; as his Billy Mack character.  You also get Olivia Olson singing the film's first big finale, &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You.&quot;  And those are just two of the bonus songs (the third is Otis Redding singing &quot;White Christmas&quot;).<br />All of the key musical moments in the film are represented on the sidetrack, from Lynden David Hall's &quot;All You Need is Love&quot; to the Beach Boys' &quot;God Only Knows.&quot;  After seeing the film it will be impossible for you to listen to &quot;Jump (For My Love)&quot; by the Pointer Sisters without thinking of Hugh Grant putting on his moves.  For those who just like good singing there is Norah Jones doing &quot;Turn Me On&quot; and Eva Cassidy's cover of Christie McVie's &quot;Songbird.&quot;<br />I do have a minor complaint in that Kelly Clarkson's &quot;The Trouble With Love Is&quot; starts off the album the same as it does with her own &quot;Thankful&quot; album, so my mind gets thrown for a loop when the second track is Dido's &quot;Here With Me&quot; instead of &quot;Miss Independent.&quot;  Fortunately I already have Joni Mitchell's &quot;River,&quot; so having &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; instead of that holiday classic on this album is but another minor bump.
B00005BF9Z|4.0|i first heard of manu chau through a friend of mine while i was in iraq. well, i started to really like this dudes music, and i beleive it has made an impression on me because of how different it is. i had never heard anything like it. i gave it four stars but really it only deserves 3.5 and the reason why i say that is because there are i think three tracks on the cd that repeat themselves. its not the same lyrics, but its basically the identical beat. in the end, i would reccomend the cd to some one who wants to listen to something very different. oh yeah and he sings in spanish, english, french and italian. its crazy!
B000084T18|3.0|Yo, 50's album is pretty ill, pretty ill, you know? Eminem's produced tracks are the best and Dre is a genius. All due respect to anyone that put their work on this album. I like most of the songs, but \\"Like My Style\\" and \\"Poor Lil Rich\\". BUT, don't believe the hype, because 50 is in no way 2Pac nor will he ever be the next Pac, he just doesn't have the depth and the will to match up to the greatest rapper to ever bless us. The lyrics are too superficial, and are more party tracks (which is cool, when you wanna party). As well, he is low on the list of Shady's best signed, Obie Trice has much more talent and sounds better than 50. And the reason that Em always sounds better than the person who's album it is, is because he always starts off his verse with a way to advertise himself, like in \\"Patiently Waiting\\" it has all the sound effects that become real intense and his voice sounds other-wordly. Anyway, still a pretty good album, but not Shady/Aftermath's best.
B00008NG5V|3.0|The cd is good, dont get me wrong, but as time went on it got boring to listen to. I still listen to it from time to time, when i wanna relax, its got some good songs.  but its not a cd that 5 years down the road i might still give frequent play to. i would reccomend it for those of you who the genre applies to more than myself. i have a wide taste in music but i like hip hop above all else so i tend to go back to that after a while.
B000000WA4|5.0|Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know, Billy Corgan's an arrogant jerk who can't sing...insert your favorite nit-pick here. The juggernaut that is MCIS will roll right over them and never even notice. We're talking about 28 songs, nearly two-and-a- half hours of music here. Even back in '95 it was a gutsy move; double-albums do for most bands' album sales what the Jonestown Kool-Aid did for kid's soft drinks. But the ever-dysfunctional Pumpkins pulled it off in grand style, even dethroning the so-called King of Pop in sales.<BR>  Musically, this album is all over the map, covering basically every impulse the Pumpkins have ever even hinted at in their previous two albums. Want alt-rock? MCIS offers up the moody, blistering \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\" and the surging, groovy \\"1979\\". Metal? Try the menacing \\"XYU\\" or the defiant \\"An Ode to No One\\" or the blitzkrieg \\"Bodies\\". Glam rock? The gorgeous \\"Thru The Eyes of Ruby\\" or the arena rock anthem \\"Muzzle\\" sparkle like sequins on Ziggy Stardust's stiletto heels. Prog rock? \\"Porcelina of the Vast Oceans\\" has the kind of weird time signatures and start-stop dynamics that would make Rush green with envy.  Tripped out, psychedelic ballads? The swooning \\"Beautiful\\" and the playful \\"Cupid de Locke\\" should satisfy your sweet tooth. Oh and there's James Iha's shimmering, lovely twin contributions of \\"Take Me Down\\" and \\"Farewell and Goodnight\\". And let's not forget \\"Where Boys Fear to Tread\\", which sounds like the soundtrack to some sort of weird vampire motorcycle gang movie as directed by Joel Shumacher during his Batman tenure. And the industrial bite and scratch of \\"Love\\" and the subtle  \\"In The Arms of Sleep\\" And...Well, you get the point. <BR>  Nirvana may have been the most talked-about and critically celebrated, Pearl Jam the most earnest, and Soundgarden the hardest but for sheer substance, for my money, even their best works can't hold a candle to what the Pumpkins achieved on MCIS. It's a feast for the ears and easily one of rock's true masterpieces.
0451167716|5.0|I can understand how this book has been haled by millions as a wonderful book. I enjoyed reading this book very much. The devolpment of characters in this book is fantastic and has great insite into the human physce. The book goes into great detail about the poilitics. You find yourself reading into great depth about how the mob works, and it amlost becomes boring, but then Bam someone dies, of a big event happens and changes the course of the novel. Wonderful book and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great mob book. I have never seen the moives, so I can not relate them.
B00004Z459|3.0|The death of Cobain and the fallout of the Axl - Slash duo have led to a void in the genre of rock, which is mistakenly thought to be filled by LP. A generation fed on Britney Spears and Eminem, too young to have witnessed the GNR / Nirvana days of the early 90s, may wrongly construe LP to be a rock band, but the fact is they're simply nu metal. By their own admission, Linkin Park claim they're not a rock band - and this couldn't be further from the truth.<BR>The boys of LP are law-abiding citizens, from good families, free from drug abuse and mentally sound. They do not make an effort to tackle any social issues, again highlighting their protected upbringing. That is what makes the lyrics sound contrived, and all the songs convey the same meaning though written in different words. One cannot help questioning the basis of their angst. It makes you wonder what took them 18 months to produce this record. Chester's vocals are very close to those of Nick Carter of BSB, except that he is a tad more powerful and can scream better and louder.<BR>Having said that, there is no denying that in their own genre of rap / rock LP have certainly made a mark with the Hybrid Theory record. Their sound is certainly original and distinct when compared to the much hyped alternative music of the likes of Travis, Blink 182, Staind, 3 Doors Down, Coldplay, etc. Some tracks that deserve a mention are Papercut, Cure For The Itch, Crawling, Runaway and By Myself.<BR>Not that I have, but if you happen to purchase Meteora, you will notice that they are repetitive and transient as is evident from the singles released of late.
6304030983|5.0|Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) discovers a strange and exciting looking game, at a construction site, and takes it home to play, he unleashes a storm of wild animals and other weird and wonderful creatures form the jungle, and disappears.<br />30 years later, two children (Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce) who have just lost their parents move with their aunt, to the same old house, where Alan Parrish lived.<br />They find this strange game in the attic, and begin to play it, unleashing, lions, zebras, monkeys, crocodiles, floods, giant insects, killer plants, bats and an insane hunter-adventurer from the 19th century, as well as all sorts of other dangers from the jungle.<br />They only start to find a solution to the Pandora's box of dangers they have released, when they release Alan Parrish himself, now grown up and a wild jungle man, from the jungle.<br />David Alan Grier plays the police man who is roped into the wild adventure, against his own wishes, (and not sure if he hasn't gone insane). Kirsten Dunst shines in her role , showing what a lovely, talented young actress she is.
B00005JMTQ|4.0|SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE is just what the season needs in the theaters - a bit of fluff with enough of a message to make it worthwhile.  FINALLY we're getting movies about women who are not only beautiful but are intelligent and definite candidates for the roles of desirable leading ladies.  Diane Keaton is a joy to watch - not only because she is beautiful but also because she is such an enormously gifted actor.  Yes, the director could have put the reigns on her 'post-transformation' crying at the loss of love; that does get tiresome.  But watch the way Keaton responds as a mother to Amanda Peet, as a sister to the always superb Frances McDormand, as a gradual paramour of an aging (well cast and well performed) Jack Nicholson, and as an incredulous recipient of the honest attractions of the younger Keanu Reeves.  In each mode of her role she is not only credible, she takes us with her on a wise (and wise-cracking) journey into new territory.<br />The openness of dealing with issues of the 'over 50 crowd' in career changes, love lost and love gained, and frank sexuality is such a relief from the norm and it is to the credit of Nancy Meyers that she continues to explore this realm (see \\"What Women Want\\").  Meyers manages to tell her tales of older romantic episodes without showing prejudice to either men or women.<br />This is a well written (at least for the first 3/4s of the film) and well directed (ditto) funny yet tender comedy that shows off the talents of the five leads very well indeed.  While the critics continue to pan the acting abilities of Keanu Reeves, here is a film that allows him subtleties and promises of depth we have not seen before.  Well worth an afternoon's relief from the holiday madness.

B00009TB5G|3.0|Wow! This trilogy is the one of the closest things to perfection that has ever graced the silver screen. Peter Jackson has created such masterful work, that i cannot bare to state anything but praise for this movie. <br />Yet, after watching this new extended version, i must confess i will stick to the original. <br />4 hours long....my gosh.  If you're thirsty for everything you can get before you see Return of the King, then by all means, get this version. It has some excellent developments to the story that do make it richer. <br />But unfortunately most of the material in these new scenes is already inferred in the original version, and it tends to dumb down the original's effectiveness and pace by adding too much detail to an already elaborate tale. 43 minutes worth no less! And a lot of it is purely humorous and witty, which numbs the emotional power of this movie notably.<br />In any case, regardless of any negative review, i would have seen this version, and so should you. But you should accept the original as the truer, most powerful version of this epic story.<br />(By the way, unlike this one, the Extended Edition of the Fellowship of the Ring is amazing, rivaling the first one for supremacy.)

B0000AQS0F|5.0|After 190 or so reviews, this one is most likely redundant. However consider another my vote for the excellent quality of the show and its eventual continuation as a TV series.  I have never seen an aired episode, (don't watch broadcast or cable).  I just received the DVD set and watched all 4 disks set over the last 3 days - it was that good.<br />Joss Whedon has clearly captured the sense of &quot;being there&quot; which he set out to accomplish.  The dialog is smartly written, relevant to the episode and rarely fails to please.  Comic relief, usually in the form of trademark one liners, is sparingly applied.  The cast works well together, is believable  and is very attractive.  <br />The blend of sets and CGI is effective and the camerawork, especially the jerky handheld feel that characterizes the CGI shots, works to create added realism.<br />I imagine the special features will please even the die hard fans.  The gag reel is a rare gift that is too often left on the editing room floor.  <br />Word's out that a Firefly feature film is in the works.  Let us hope it spawns the continuation of the series.<br />Roy<br />PS.  If your thinking about buying this DVD set, stop.  Just buy it.  You'll be glad you did.
B00005JMTQ|5.0|Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton are charming in this humorous love story about two intelligent, if not totally romantically  centered, members of the middle-age set (toward the older end of the range).<br />Diana Keaton has never been better.  This was finally her perfect role.  Jack Nicholson was cast in a part that could have been written especially for him.  Erica Barry (Keaton) a successful middle-aged playwright who has emotionally and sexually closed herself off after divorcing her husband of 22 years (Paul Michael Glaser, still looking pretty good himself), meets the older man in her young daughter Marin's (Amanda Peet) life.  This meeting marked by sudden, unexpected attack of the heart exposes her to successful entrepreneur and playboy Harry Sanborn (Nicholson).  Sanborn has 'played at life' all of his 63 years before finally starting to get down to 'living his life' after facing the reality that he might have come close to the end of his life.  Proving it never rains but it pours, Barry unexpectedly simultaneously claims the attention of Sanborn's young doctor (Keanu Reeves), some 20 years her junior, who finds her beauty and intelligence magnetically attractive.<br />During a real rain storm, the genuine romance of the film begins to bloom.  The charm of the movie is in looking on as two emotionally-challenged characters experience love, perhaps for the very first time, with all its pitfalls, peaks, comical and embarrassing moments, and the magic, tender, endearing episodes that make true love the roller coaster it always is.<br />Keaton beautifully handles the over-the-top emotions of falling in love, portraying the highs and the lows, with equal brilliance.  Nicholson, who as always portrays every mental spark that is a thought and every feeling that is an emotion on that amazing face; always a portrait in motion that can be as easily read as words on a page.<br />There are a lot of laughs in this film and there are a lot of truths in the tale.  Some reviewers have called this a menopause chick-flick.  The audience when I attended was about equal male/female, including some male viewers without dates.  The laughter seemed equally distributed along gender lines, telling me that the guys 'get it' as well as the females.<br />Timeless romance with a sterling cast.  See it soon and be reminded that love just gets better with age, as have Keaton and Nicholson.reviewers have called this a menopause chick-flick.

B0000844IT|5.0|ARMY OF DARKNESS is the third entry in Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD TRILOGY. It is a great comedy that mixes genres and has some of the best one liners in cinema history. This BOOMSTICK EDITION is the 1,000 time the film has been on DVD and is the definitive version. Here are the bonus materials:<BR>-Director's Cut: Along with the original theatrical version is the director's cut which runs 15 minutes longer. Of the two, I prefer the theatrical version. Although I love the alternate ending in the director's cut, I think the humor in the theatrical ending is more in tune with the rest of the film. The other added scenes are good but the final battle now goes on far too long with there being long periods of no laughs or even interesting action.<BR>-Commentary (only on director's cut): By Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and Ivan Raimi. A very funny and informative track.<BR>-Featurette: A good featurette that goes into the makeup and monster FX of the movie. Although it would've been better as a full documentary.<BR>-Deleted Scenes (with optional commentary): Some good scenes that should've been in the director's cut but might've brought down the pace of the film.<BR>-Storyboards: You can view the director's storyboards as you watch the film.<BR>-Photo Gallery: Concepts of the monsters.<BR>-Trailer: A very funny trailer.<BR>  Also included is a booklet written by Bruce Campbell, making this one of the best horror/cult movie releases on DVD.
B00005JMFO|5.0|After anticipating this film for months, I only saw it yesterday, well after the release date.  Some scheduling conflicts slowed me down, but some not-so-hot reviews made me less than in a hurry anyway.<br />I am glad I didn't put too much stock in those negative reviews, because I loved this movie.  Forget that it could be construed as somewhat anti-American, that it has many multiple plot lines, that it doesn't have a deep, ponderous story line, and/or that it has a sprinkling of sex (gasp), or even that some viewers have deemed it superficial.  It is full of love and laughter.  There are some great lines and the audience does a lot of laughing.<br />This is one very, very enjoyable film set around the Christmas holidays and filled with simultaneous intertwined stories that are all about love.  All kinds of love, from every perspective.  The cast of 100's is wonderful without exception.  Thomas Sangster (Sam) gives a lovable, flawless performance as the step-son of recently widowed Liam Neeson (Daniel).  You can't help falling in love with the child.  Billy Nighy (Billy Mack), who was great in 'Blow Dry' will blow you away with his performance of an aging rock star trying to push his recording of 'Christmas Is All Around' to #1.  Alan Rickman once again gives a stand-out portrayal in a small role, because he simply can't ever turn in any other kind.<br />The music in the film is an excellent backdrop for the various tales of love. Hugh Grant's choreography to 'Jump (For My Love)' is reminiscent of Tom Cruise's frisky dancin' in 'Risky Business', except Grant is portraying the Prime Minister of England rather than a teenager, has all his clothes on - not just his underwear, is several decades older, and is ever so much hotter than Tom!<br />As for the sex some reviewers keeps talking about - well, after all, it's a fact of life, sex and love do go together.  It is interesting and refreshing to see the differences in the on/off screen personas of skin-flick actors when appearing in their films and when falling in love off camera.  Just another aspect of love.<br />One little warning, if you don't currently have a love in your life-this film can sometimes get to you just a little. The film does such a superb job at showing the viewer all those 'little things' that are so much a wonderful part of love.  Those moments can catch one off guard and make one somewhat winsome. But don't let that keep you away from the theater, love is actually all around anyway so it is difficult to get away from it even in the real world.<br />This part is for fans of Billy Bob Thornton.  I have not seen one photo of Billy Bob in this character.  I was especially anxious to see BB as President.  As would be expected, he looks GREEEAAAT!  I am not going to discuss the character of his role, the negative or the positive of it, nor speculate how/why he selected this role.  I will say that even in this small cameo it is so easy to see the undeniably excellent talent of Thornton.  He has the bearing; in body, demeanor, facial expressions, the whole nine-yards, of a president, and he pulls it off, as with every other role, with seeming ease.  Ladies, he is so good looking as the leader of the U.S., he will take your breath away.  WoW.  His few minutes of screen time will definitely be worth the price of admission to Billy Bob fans.  To all else it is just another bright moment in a sparking holiday love story.<br />'Love Actually' is a feel good movie that actually makes you feel good, makes you smile, cry, laugh, and care, really care about the characters, and it reminds us why we all actually love love.s when appearing in their films and when falling in love off camera.

078324228X|3.0|Ok, those who did not take my other review seriously because of my grammar and spelling mistakes, I'll type it correctly this time. <BR>1) Rubin had been in jail before. Why did he refuse to wear the uniform if he had committed the crime. <BR>2) When Rubin was in jail, he committed over 16 years of his life to reading books on law. He appealed and appealed. The Judge said NOT GUILTY. Saying the state based thier argument on racial hatred rather then facts.<BR>3) Any one who knew rubin closely knew if Rubin would hurt someone he would use his fists. PS. no murder weapon found.<BR>4) Why would Rubin attract so much attention/media, if he was the clear-cut criminal [...] says he is. I'm not hiding it, please visit that site, see for yourself. When viewing just take a second to think, why would so much be written about him, why would his court case proceed for more then 2 decades and why would he capture the hearts of a nation, if thats what he was and is, a brutal thug. Nothing more or less.<BR>5) Rubin is not as violent as some think. Yes he had a temper problem, but when asked about his sport (boxing) he said it was just a way to get paid. He didn't like it or hate it. It was just what he did. Also, now, Rubin is leading a protest to BAN boxing as he sees it as barbaric.<br />PLEASE, think about what you write about Rubin and whom it may affect, i wrote my other review in anger because i would picture Rubin reading all the disgusting things written about him. He rotted in prison for what, to be doubted and dismissed as a thug. I didn't write my review in anger this time, I still believe what I said in my other review, and to those who havent read it, plese read it, (excuse the grammar and spelling mistakes)and just take heed to some things I've mentioned. Stop stepping on this great fighters legacy.
B00004YRQA|5.0|There is not much you can say about a memory card, but if you are in the market for one, this is the one I'd recommend.  I have purchased others that weren't Sony brand, but were supposed to work with the PS2 and had horrible experiences.<br />This card allowed for tons of game saves, deleting, copying, and saving over and over.  I have been able to save games that I only play every once in a while and still be able to come back to play months later with no trouble.<br />The only con is the price, I think that it's a little high for what it is a piece of plastic with some type of chip inside that you save to.  Considering these are mass produced I find the cost of the outrageous.<br />However, I still stand behind the product itself.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|I think these girls have talent. Their songs are upbeat and catchy.  The thing is,  If you would like to not be...let's say this...'deafened' by the lyrics, I advise you get the Russian album.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|I highly advise against the purchase of this album. Jet is possibly one of the worst new acts around and they are an embodiment of what will eventually lead to the downfall of the grage rock revival. You may be asking yourself what my reasoning is for such a bad review. My reply, they are musical thiefs. I point you first to their song \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" which is a blatant rip off of Iggy Pop's 1977 hit \\"Lust For Life\\", and to \\"Look What You've Done\\" which features a stolen riff from The Beatles' \\"Golden Slumbers\\" just to name a few. Then I'd ask you to look at the name of their band \\"Jet\\" which is stolen from the 1970's glam supergroup. The album cover is a cross between The Beatles' 1966 \\"Revolver\\" and The Who's (also) 1966 'A Quick One\\", nothing original. The name of the album \\"Get Born\\" is a refrence to the Bob Dylan song \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" which actually I can appreciate, but still being they're thiefs this should be brought up. This band has no musical originality, if these songs sound farmiliar it's because they are. This stuff has been goin on for years in rap music but I think we would want to keep it out of our rock, especially rock which claims to be indie; remember Vanilla Ice's explanation of the difference between \\"Ice Ice Baby\\" and Queen and Bowie's \\"Under Pressure?\\" \\"Their's goes do do do da da do do mine goes do do do da da da do do\\" it's the same thing. Please be sound musical fans don't buy this album.

0345440757|1.0|I am a mom of four children aged 15, 9, 6, and 4 years.  I was asked to purchase this for a new mom baby shower gift. Before gifting to the new mommy, I took a look and got sucked in to finish reading. I was astounded at some of the advice given. Only would be useful if you want to train up your baby in the way you might train a puppy, then this is the one for you. This is not a good gift for a person interested in gentle parenting or someone having their first child. I suggest a more rounded parenting guide such as one by Sears or Brazelton.  A baby is not a Pup to housebreak and fit into your routine. Your life will change when you have kids and your routine will change too. This book gives the unrealistic expectation that you can somehow mold your baby's personality into your lifestyle by following her schedule. Before buying, take a look at the other parenting top sellers out there.
B000062XGJ|5.0|This action-packed sci-fi film starring Arnold Schawarzenegger is one of my all-time favorite films. Arnold is the leader of an elite U.S rescue squad who are assigned in the South America jungle to search for officials taken hostage by Guerrilla fighters. When they get to the green fested jungle, they discover skinned bodies and realize who could have done this? The team destroy the rebel encampment despite rescuing zero hostages. Mission accomplished, the team are suddenly being targeted by an alien creature picking them off one at a time. Arnold, now the only one left, uses his brains instead of brawn in to survive against a larger and more smarter being out of this world.<BR>     <BR>     The special effects and the action are well done here. The suspense and the vast amount of blood are relivent throughout the film. I love the scene when the Predator shoots off a soldier's arm and then the arm is still triggering the gun. The Predator's weapons are very eleborate. It has a sort of laser weapon on its shoulder and has the ability to become invisible. Arnold is the man. The guy has the best lines. &quot;Predator&quot; is filled with flair and the pace is outstanding. It should be in everyone's film library.

B00004TDTO|5.0|I like to say &quot;Jaws&quot; is a personal film to me. As a kid I rented this film so many times I suddenly realized i could haved bought it. But now I do. &quot;Jaws&quot; is a classic movie. Packed with sheer terror, suspense, and the best score films could ever have. Who can forget it? It's 50% percent of the film's success. This blockbuster film adapted from Peter Benchley's novel has a huge killer shark terrorizing a New England summer resort. We know that. The people who are trying to stop is Chief Brody (Roy schiender, great performance), shark specialist Hooper (Richard dreyfuss, in fine and humerous form) and &quot;crazy&quot; shark hunter (Robert Shaw, I love this actor, he gives the best performance in this film, who can forget his USS Indianapolis speech?)How can I count the many infamous scenes in this film? But first I got to give nod to Steven Speilberg, he's the master of suspense (after Alfred Hitchcock).Back to my favorite scenes. I love the opening scenes with a pretty girl being chewed up by the shark. I also love the ending with Quint(Shaw) also being chewed up. Chief Brody also blowing up the shark is unforgetable. Luckily Spielberg didn't show the shark until half way into this film, it's pretty fake. But I'm not dissing the shark, it's the reason why this film was a blockbuster. In summary, it's one of the greatest movies of all time and should be in everyone's film library. Go &quot;Jaws&quot;!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I consider Britney to be a girl with vocal and performing talents. Some things she did in the past, I liked: ('Stronger', 'Born To Make You Happy', 'Boys'), but her albums were often with too much fillers.<br />When she's in the right hands with good material and a good producing team, she can do things that sets her apart from the rest. And this CD is the evidence of that.<br />Although I don't like every song, there is plenty of convincing stuff on this CD. <BR>I find 'Toxic' the best track of the album. Musically speaking a sort of ELO meets surf rock.<BR>'Early Mornin' is another great track. 'Outrageous' is good, but sounds a bit too much like 'Addictive' (Thruth Hurts).<br />All'n all, with this CD Britney is moving up to the same league where Madonna and Kylie Minogue reside. So that is surely a big leap forward for Britney.
B00001QEE7|5.0|Okay, I know what you are thinking.  The Little Mermaid?  Are You Serious??  The answer for you who are thinking that is yes.  I remember this movie from a long time ago.  Me bring 16 now, I don't watch it as much as I did when I was about 10 or 6 but, it is in my collection of movies that rock and roll!  The Little Mermaid at first was a cheesy movie but, after watching it after 2 times, I started to fell the vibe that it had and preformed on anyone who watches it for the first time.  This is the best Disney movie there will ever be and you can't change my mind and no one can or could.  The movie follows the life of a mermaid named Ariel who is ALWAYS in trouble over one thing or another.  She fall's in love with a human and when her father hears about this, he can't believe it.  After forbidding her from seeing him or going to watch him, she does it anyways.  There is something for everyone in this major film about the life and wonderings of the teenage mermaid Ariel.
B000088E6D|5.0|Memories of the past are better than the real thing!!  Michael Buble is reminiscent of the good old days when songs had melodies, sighed of romance, and had understandable words.<BR>TheGod-given velvet voice of a very handsome young Canadian brings the charisma of Frank Sinatra to the new millenium of youngsters who never knew Frank, and to oldsters who swooned and danced to the cool jazz/pop sounds during their youth. Easily the best new talent in his genre, Michael Buble was a recent rage on the Today Show before his European Tour.  Ears will be delighted with his soothing sounds!
B00005JMCT|5.0|I almost cried during this film as a matter of fact I would have peed my pants if I didn't use the bathroom before hand...This movie was hilarious!!!!  The friends that I went with had to hold me in my seat (ok maybe not) but I was darn close to rolling in the isles.  <br />Yes, as you probably heard the whole cast didn't return for the conclusion to the Pie trilogy but to tell you the truth I didn't even notice they were missing.  The movie also didn't follow the same format as it's predecessors...yes, Jim was caught in every un-imaginable sexually related scenario but this movie was a freshly baked slice of pie.<br />I swear this one has to be the raunchiest of them all.  In the end though it made me want to fall in love (man I'm in love with Alyson Hannigan, damn she is getting married in real life :-(, it really did a good job pulling at the 'ole heart strings.  Right from the first Pie I knew these two (Jim and Michelle) where going to elope, truly a match made in movie heaven... <BR> There were many unexpected things in this movie including the fact that all the funny scenes where not in the previews.  Stifler's other side shows, believe it, he's not as shallow as you may have thought.  And this movie is a great \\"what not to do guide for the groom.\\"  For being a sequel it was actually comparable to the first installment, if not funnier.  <br />It is kind of sad really, no more sexual misadventures of Jim or any other of the American Pie crew for that matter...unless they decide to make it into a new TV series.  Hey it's possible, have you seen what they are putting on the TV nowadays, this would actually be an improvement.  Got off topic there for a second...well my recommendation is to go see this movie, sure you don't need the big screen to enjoy a movie such as this but who can wait till it comes out on DVD (your going to want to buy it anyway, not rent it especially when they come out with the deluxe unrated collectors edition of the American Pie series with 500 hours of never before seen raunchy footage).  All right back to our regularly scheduled day...
B00005U11Z|1.0|Journey's Over...<br />It is laughable that the members of Journey would portray the replacement of the irreplacable Steve Perry as just another step in their long, ongoing evolution.  Sure, not only did Journey not have a lead singer in their initial incarnation, Mr. Perry wasn't even their first, right?  So bring this Augieri fellow on board is just another bold leap into the creative unknown for this group of fearless artists!  RIGHT!  The fact is that when they recruited Steve Perry, that WAS a pretty bold (if commercial) move for the band which to that time had had moderate success but also had a well established following.  And it resulted in a drastic overhaul of the band's sound and an almost total ditching of their repertoire to that point.  Well, in 1998 they recruited Steve Augieri for one reason alone: to replicate Steve Perry.  There is absolutely nothing creative or bold.  Their goal is not to create new sounds, but a desperate bid to recapture their glory days which their former golden-boy can no longer deliver.  If I were Perry I'd be suing their buts off, but that's just me.  signed, Steve Perry.
B00006AG5N|5.0|My grandma bought this CD when she found out about my new passion for Elvis Presley.  I loved it!  It has all of my favorite Elvis songs including 'Suspicious Minds', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Heartbreak Hotel', 'Marie's the Name (His latest flame)', 'Devil in Disguise' and 'Hound Dog'.  The sound is just great, and the bonus track, the remix of 'A Little Less Conversation' isn't as good as the original but still wicked cool.  All the songs are good, not just the ones listed above.  it's definitely the best fo Elvis.
B00003CWL6|5.0|\\"American Beauty\\" is a truly rare film, in my opinion.  But not in the way that most reviewers will tell you.  I could certainly mention the awards it has won, its delicate play of satire, etc.  But it is rare to me because it is one of the few films I can watch over and over and never tire.  The cast is alive in this film, the emotions are real, and it's all in your face.  The chemistry that is created on-screen in this film is unparalleled in recent years.  It definitely has the feel of a play, where the cast is not separated from each other.  It's quite likely that Sam Mendes brought this attribute from his stage experience and introduced it to the film.  I can only say that it works marvelously.  Kevin Spacey is brilliant and Annette Bening manages to create sympathy for a character to whom I truly did not want to become attached.<br />A dear friend of mine is disturbed by the \\"perverse\\" sexual content in the film.  I can only say that this film is dealing with that perversity and finding that it is, perhaps, more natural and less perverse than we may think.  In the very least, it is an aspect of our lives that is right under our noses whether or not we are aware of it.  This film manages to present America, in all of its faults and failures.  And yet out of those faults, life as we know it emerges.  And life is a wonderful thing, any way you slice it.<br />With great directing, a truly memorable cast, and a stirring soundtrack, \\"American Beauty\\" promises to be a film that I will continue to watch many years to come.  The DVD translates the film beautifully, and the special features are definitely worth a look.
B000060K4O|5.0|Upon a recommendation from my father, who, like me, is a big Sigourney Weaver fan, I took my allowance one Saturday, walked to Blockbuster with a friend and bought the Ghostbusters DVD. I watched it at my friend's house and once I started I yelled at her about not putting on subtitles.  But I loved the movie.  By the middle of the movie, my friend's dad and little sister were watching with us.<br />  Ghostbusters is the hilariously clever, brilliantly designed, interestingly casted movie.  They plot was a little strange, but that just added to the enjoyment of the movie.  With Sigourney Weaver starring as Dana Barrett,  Dr. Peter Venkman's (Bill Murray) 'would-be-girlfriend' and Rick Moranis as the lovestruck, nerdy, neighbor of Dana Barrett's, Louis Tully.<br />  After Dana encounters a strange creature in her refrigerator, she calls on the Ghostbusters, a business dealing with the removal of paranormal pests for help.  When one of them, Venkman, sees Dana, he immediately falls in love with her.  But when he is unable to locate the ghost in Dana's house, she shuns him with a 'You son't act like a scientist.  You're more like a game show host.'  Venkman leaves, still thinking about her.  Later on, when Dana is possesed by the creature from her refrigerator it's up to the Venkman, along with his coworkers, Ray Stantz and Egon Spengler (and Winston Zeddeman)to stop the evil Gozer from destroying the world.<br />  This is a very interesting DVD.  It's absolutely HILARIOUS!  I was laughing nearly the whole time.  If you need some laughs, buy/rent this DVD.  You won't be sorry!
B00006DEFA|5.0|I just happened to watch the film and the documentary \\"The making of Amadeus\\" yesterday - not the first time though. All I can say is that after all these years, I am still deeply touched by the story, its characters and the absolute perfectionism and emotion with which the film was realized. Understanding Mozart's life is certainly not to be achieved by watching a movie - even though this one is wonderfully crafted. However this devine spirit that must have lead Mozart in creating music comes across very intensely - and becomes even more poignant through the documentary. It shows the immense dedication and emotionality that everyone in the project contributed: Shaffer, Forman, all actors and production staff. I am thankful for this wonderful work.
B00005AQGH|4.0|Please don't think everyone in Alabama is as narrow minded at AMusic Fan. I think it's hilarious that he criticizes other reviewers for using improper English, yet he fails to follow the rules of grammar himself.  And to jujyfruit, how can you accuse someone of being prejudiced, then cut him down just for being from a different part of the world than you? Have you ever been to Alabama? You may not be racist, but you are just as prejudiced as A Music Fan is.  In a way, your attitude is even more disturbing than his is, because you're making a carpet generalization about everyone in the state, whether they are white, black, Hispanic, or whatever. You were trying to make a point, however, and you made it well. AMusic Fan, no one cares about your Japanese friend and his family.  There is no significant Japanese community in Montgomery. The dialect spoken by many blacks in the Deep South has evolved over hundreds years, and was originally created by African slaves who were forced to learn the language of their oppressors against their will.  If you went to England, your accent (as well as that of most Americans) would sound like that of some ridiculous cowboy compared to the traditional British dialects, so don't claim to be speaking proper English. Your ill-conceived diatribe only hurts your credibility, as well as the reputation of any group you identify yourself with.  Montgomery is one of the few American cities with an equal number of white and black residents.  After all the battles for civil rights in the fifties and sixties, the city could be a great example of how the American Dream is supposed to work. Sadly, narrow-minded people of both colors still try to hold back the town's real potential.  This is not only a problem in the American South, but also around the world.  All right, now for the review.  No one can deny that Tupac was a lyrical genius.  His verses had a depth and cohesiveness that no rap artist has matched before or since.  He possessed an incredible talent for telling a story with every verse and on every song.  Every album openly exposed his inner turmoil as well as his external conflicts against the system and against other rappers.  The instrumental underpinning and the melodic hooks on his tracks were intoxicating.  Tupac's tragic life serves as an example of the highest heights and lowest lows of rap superstardom.  While he was among the most socially conscious of the 90's rappers, he failed to let go of the gangsta/ thug life mentality that propelled him to success.  It was this mentality that eventually caused his untimely death.  Looking back on the gangsta rap phenomenon, it's rather sad to listen to the hopelessness encapsulated in verse after verse of rhyme on countless albums.  In a hundred years, historians will be re-examining these lyrics and wondering why the crisis of crime and drug abuse in America's urban centers was not taken more seriously in the 20th Century.  Tupac paid the price for embracing the constraints of the time and the place in which he lived.  Let us hope that rap will continue to grow and evolve to become a positive voice in American pop culture.
0800141849|4.0|I agree with most of the reviews criticizing this film for giving us neurotic, frumpy Babs vs. self-assured, Hollywood Babs. Pretty shallow. I also thought the college lecture scenes were embarrassingly unprofessional (BTW, I'm a community college prof. To the reviewer who said &quot;well maybe at a community college,&quot; stop showing your ignorance. We're as professional as any professors out there). But, I'm cutting this movie some slack, because it's wonderful to see a good love story involving adults for a change! Overall, it is a good movie. I enjoy watching it each time I see it. Barbra Streisand and Jeff Bridges have chemistry and are really fun to watch. George Siegal is hilarious; I wish he'd been in more scenes. When you see gorgeous Lauren Bacall, you wonder why other stars don't just allow themselves to age as beautifully as she has, instead of having so much plastic surgery they wind up looking like bizarre androids. It's a treat to see her back on screen.<br />I'd watch this movie for the sumptuous scenery and well-crafted score alone, but the acting and story are fun, as well. Not perfect, certainly, but a wonderful love story for adults. I think it also does raise the issue of society's focus on ridiculously narrow definitions of female beauty and the effect it has on us all. I had a friend who use to say about a lot of men, &quot;He missed the most gorgeous orchid because he wasted all his time looking for a rose.&quot; With all the superficiality and bad relationships out there, does make you think. But, most of all, it's a movie I can watch over and over again and enjoy it every time.
B00005JKEZ|4.0|1.  This review is focused on the film's original and historic film score as presented in this DVD-Video (DVD-V) release.  The DVD-V contains two discs of a quartet of recent discs released on DVD and CD marking the 65th anniversary of the film (see reviews of the film's music on CD release Marco Polo 8.225268 and DVD-Audio release Marco Polo 5.220501).   2.  The Adventures of Robin Hood (TAORH) was Erich Wolfgang Korngold's (EWK) first (and only) score for a motion picture filmed in color (using the three-stripe Technicolor process then crossing over from experimental shorts to features).  This is also the first film score to be broadcast pretty much intact, live, and on coast-to-coast radio (with Sir Guy of Gisbourne, recently recovered, narrating the story) in 1938.  You can hear that broadcast on Disc 2.  For Warner Bros., TAORH was the studio's first release of a full-color feature and the first with a budget of such magnitude (around two million USD all told which is pretty close to 200 million in today's movie-inflated dollars).    3.  Disc 1 contains much (but not all) of the original sound track (OST) processed for the first time in Dolby Digital which yields a spectacular restoration!  Disc 2 includes a number of improvised excerpts from film scores played, hummed, and \\"sung\\" by the composer along with a bit of chatting (mostly protesting) by EWK-I believe this is the first time Korngold's voice has been heard in a commercial recording (shades of Garbo!).  4.  There are some problems with the audio recordings presented on this disc set.  For starters, while the OST on Disc 1 contains most \\"major\\" cues (but not in their entirety), many others are missing (starting just a few minutes into the film).  Given the history of how the OST recording was rescued from obliteration in the proverbial eleventh hour, we are indeed fortunate to have what we have.  However,  the cues presented on this disc are synchronized with a silent version of the film.  This means that they end up being separated by all sorts of pauses (while dialog is occurring).  Presenting a chopped up version of the OST as an adjunct to a de faco silent movie seems pretty dumb.  Only those with an academic interest in matching cues with film scenes MAY find this of value-say about five folks on the entire planet!   Next we have the \\"live\\" radio broadcast on Disc 2.  This appears to be a complete version (at a little over 28 min), but it suffers from print through and wow&flutter, especially at the beginning.  Given these tell-tale signs, this presentation does not sound like it was directly derived from original studio records.  Perhaps of greater interest is that the miking/mixing is also decidedly different (and much improved) from an earlier, shorter version released on CD (Facet 8104, 1987, available from Amazon.com) which really sounds like a live recording!.  So are we really hearing a live broadcast on Disc 2 or a post-broadcast studio recording?  Finally, we have the \\"Erich Wolfgang Korngold Piano Session\\" also on Disc 2 (called \\"Korngold Scoring Session\\" on the back of the slip case) broken down into fragments from 12 listed film scores (and a few notes and bars from other ones).  Although not acknowledged, all fragments come from a tape made in 1951 at a birthday for and at the home of Mr. Ray Heindorf (Music Director for Warner Bros.) with the composer as the honored guest (Heindorf also made the recording).  (One fragment, \\"Love for Love\\" from ESCAPE ME NEVER, 1947, has appeared on at least three CDs and one laser disc, with the source usually not clearly acknowledged.)   No fragment exceeds 2 min 30 sec, and several are less than 30 sec long.  Fragmentizing as opposed to just running the tape end to end also seems pretty dumb.  It is simply not the way to enjoy  an impromptu session of Korngold at the piano.  5.  Bottom line:  Buy this DVD set for the film (and supplemental video materials), but NOT for the OST and related recordings.    WilliamFlanigan, Ph.D.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Dear DT fans please understand this after hearing TOT especially the song titled (In the name Of God) myself I would like to post a message to Mr Yngwie Malmsteen with all my respect to him Malmsteen, please change your line of business, I don't think you can compose or play such overwhelming riffs of John Petrucci's.<BR>And for Mr. John Petrucci this message is coming to you from Egypt, thank you very much for your performance, your solos kicks ass, the whole album is very very very good .
B00005JM0B|1.0|With the 3rd part of the series now installed, The Terminator goes the full circle: from groundbreaking (T1) to braindead (T3).<BR>   The only question that lingers painfully on after watching this disastrouly bad film is whether it's actually a parody of the previous 2 parts. If it is, then it fails at that too because funny it isn't either. <BR>    But, if this is supposed to be taking itself seriously (and i'm afraid it does) then it fails even worse because there's absolutely nothing serious about it oncesoever:<BR>  -a childish and sorry excuse for a script that never takes off, goes (inevitably) nowhere and finishes in noman's land..<BR>  -acting for which you'd have to conduct some serious search to find it in as bad quality as it's found here<BR>  -a braindead explosion-festival that looks like a sony-station game with little ambition, where the good wipe off the bad and vice versa leaving the audience with a functioning brain in total apathy..<br />    This is really a pity considering that T1 which kicked this series of films off was cutting-edge on many levels and T2 did follow up in a respectable manner. This one though is obviously just a cheap vehicle for making money. There is no &quot;edge&quot; here, as all the explosion fair has been seen before countless times, there's no extension of the plot from the previous &quot;Terminators&quot;, there's frankly nothing.<BR>   There are some things though that are in fact impressive, indeed far more impressive than the &quot;effects&quot; which are actually a bad repetition of those in T2: that would be the fact that &quot;Arnie&quot; seems to speak worse and more unintelligible english the longer he's in America. I cant begin to imagine how that could be possible but several times through this &quot;film&quot; i caught myself thinking &quot;what was that, what did he say???&quot; <BR>   <BR>It hardly matters of course as there's barely anything of remote importance being uttered in this joke of a film but i'm still wondering.<br />   As for the rest of the cast, I've seen real B-movies with far better acting than this. I'm saying B-movies, cuzz this is what T3 really is. A b-flick destined for the video-club sematary at best, allthough you'b wasting your money even if you simply rented this. As well as your time.<BR>   Hopefully he won't &quot;be back&quot;.
B000127LW2|3.0|Star trek voyager was the first series i began to watch from the beggining to the end,the annoying part of that was i spent a fortune collecting all the videos and now there coming out in a much better and cheaper format.<BR>As a first season it beats TNG and DS9,which its improved effects, faster paced action and stronger budget.The pilot episode is especially strong,with a effective story and superb acting to back it up.Kate Mulgrew is very convincing as a powerful female captain,and the other roles seemed to be cast just right.The ship is new and fresh and looks alot more up to date,as do the sets.<BR>However in contrast to later seasons this is not voyager at its best (especially as its missing Jeri Ryan),star trek does its usual and uses the first year for us to get to know the characters and the ship.<BR>Voyager as a series goes through different stages from good to superb and then drops a few bars to average.Towards the last few years the stories get repetitive and strained,almost as if they had run out of ideas,too many episodes were focused on the borg (as a result ruining there image and reputation) instead of introducing us to new aliens.However overall its still a great series to have on dvd and season's 3 and 4 are star trek at its best,roll on enterprise next..
6305291489|5.0|The original was great, this one is better.Lindsay Lohan was better than Hayley Mills, Dennis Quaid was better than Brian Keith, however, of course, no one is better than Maureen O'Hara.<br />Both the original and this remake are good editions to any family library.
B00005JKC3|4.0|There are a lot of things to like and a lot of things to hate so I put them in two different categories.<br />Good: The special effects are okay but of course, they don't make up for dumping Lou Ferrigno. The casting was good even if the TV series casting was better. Some good old memories are brought back when some guy comes out of no where and beat up Bruce Banner. Bad: Ending and Dog scene was bad (why was the Hulk fighting a poodle?). Breaking up the screen with several views was annoying<br />Overall this movie makes up for bad Cartoons, but the TV series is much better.
B0000DIXRU|3.0|OK, here it is. To be honest, after listening to the whole album I felt a kinda relief - it's not coz the CD was great, it was coz at last after 2 albums written with use of the simplest music standards in the world, Anathema set their mind into somethin more sophisticated (not a great deal but to some extent, anyway). The album IS a letdown, as even the band members concede, but at least it's more ambitious than 'Judgement and 'A fine day to exit' (which I liked more, tho): by ambitious parts i mean e.g. vocals on 'Balance', weird drums conception on 'Violence', and even a step ahead and using metalizer on vocals ('Closer', tho it sounds more like Eiffel 65 now:) ). But...... have a listen to 'Electricity' and you'll find a melody that sounds fine, but I guess those guys who compose tunes for children toys, would afford somethin far more sophisticated. All in all, if you liked 2 previous albums, you'll swallow this one, too, tho probably with some disappointment. There is a merit, nevertheless: again, a beautiful CD-cover concept - it's the best part of Anathema since 'A fine day...'.
B000002J03|5.0|Zeppelin is such a powerful influence on so many acts.  Many will say their favorite album was Led Zeppelin IV.  I prefer this masterpiece over Zeppelin IV, I think because of The Lemon Song. Something about that song is so magical.  I heard Sublime mix Lemon Song on Get Out and I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever heard.
B000060P79|5.0|Pop-punk, it's always a thing peoplel ike to argue about, but sp just gets past it all. Their music is awesome, and has a point to it, there are some slow songs, but there are also upbeat songs. This is an essential for everyone's cd collection.
B000069AUI|1.0|Funny people compare Coldplay to Radiohead or U2.  I honestly thought I was hearing Dave Mathews on the radio.  If your into a band that sounds like some other band thats already done it way better, Coldplay is for you.  I imagine Joshua Tree is older than most of this band's listeners anyways so it doesnt friggin matter.
B000069AUI|1.0|Coldplay's music passes that creative boundry between being influenced by its predecessors and outright copying.  This album could never have been made had Coldplay not had U2 playing in the background while writing their music.  The only recommendation I could make regarding this album is that Coldplay foward half their earnings to U2.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First of all this was a great show, and it will be back in one form or another , you know the plot from the other hundreds of reviews so im gonna tell you my story and it might convince you to buy the DVD set because YOU MUST WATCH IT. <br />I was surprised that i actually liked this show having never watched any of Joss Whedon's shows before in my life, (buffy angle etc - never appealed to me) i saw an advert for firefly on uk-scifi and didnt watch it due to the fact it was made by the creator of buffy/angle, however for some reason or another i was was flicking through the tv channels when and firefly came onto my screen (think it was Ariel) since then i have been hooked and never looked back, and if you buy these DVDs i believe you will feel the same way after watching them
B0000A1RJI|3.0|While there is no doubt the music for Pirates is excellent, it seems to me that Badelt spent way too much time studying Zimmer before he wrote this score. I actually thought it was Zimmer before I saw the CD. The main theme is almost a carbon copy of the main theme in Gladiator. While Zimmer uses the same themes in all of his scores (Gladiator, the Rock, Crimson Tide), we don't need another composer following his lead.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|Like the previous review, I also needed a few listens before it got to me.  The first time I listened to Absolution, I only spotted a couple stand-out winners in the album: &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; and &quot;Hysteria&quot;.<br />After I kept it on repeat for a while, there were more and more songs that I absolutely loved.  &quot;Butterflies &amp; Hurricanes&quot; couldn't be a more fitting title to this song.  It sweeps you from the delicate, soothing sounds of Bellamy's voice into an emotional storm of vocals, piano, and guitar, and back again.  <br />This entire album takes you through a similar rollercoaster ride from song to song, not unlike previous MUSE albums.  They are continuing to exploit their talents (you know, in a good way).<br />&quot;Time Is Running Out&quot;, &quot;Sing For Absolution&quot;, &quot;Blackout&quot;, and &quot;Ruled By Secrecy&quot; are all amazing songs.  With each listen, I'm sure the list will soon grow to include the entire cd.<br />This album is a must have for anyone who wants a collection that opposes all the sound-alikes that are flooding our radios.  (i.e. buy this if you know what's good for you)
B000035Z1Z|5.0|I wish there where ten more films like this.One of my favorites Sure its escapist but terrific entertainment.The actors are total masters of the genre  and the sound track with the great Toots Theileman's harmonica playing is to die for.( I even liked that one of the songs seemed Italian more than french) A madcap adventure that has the power to lift you out of the daily crap we all have to wade through . My only criticism is that it had to end. Gimme More!!!!:)
B000002AGE|5.0|Heavy Weather is one of those albums that is amazingly well constructed and works well with more than the jazz/fusion audience, a great example of this is Zawinul's No. 1 hit \\"Birdland\\".<br />This album documents not only amazing compostions, but amazing musicianship also. You have on one hand, Zawinul's wonderful, soft ballad, \\"A Remark You Made\\", and on the other hand, you have Shorter's hard-hitting latinesque \\"Palladium\\". <br />I also think WR worked much better as a group with a  percussion/drum section - in this case, Manolo Badrena & Alex Acuna were a great rhythm duo. Their joint compostion \\"Rumba Mama\\" is a wonderful display of their mixed talents<br />This was also the first album that contained Jaco Pastorius as a fully-fledged member of the group, and here he contributed two compositions, \\"Teen Town\\" and \\"Havona\\".<br />I just don't know what's happened to the ending of Shorter's \\"Palladium\\". On the original LP release, it finished on a fade, but now it's a sudden dramatic ending. <br />Heavy Weather is up there with the best of WR's work. <br />Great Stuff!
B00000K0T8|4.0|When mentioning top Wu solo album's, \\"Ironman\\" gets lost in the shuffle with albums like \\"Liquid Swords\\" and \\"Only built 4 Cuban Linx\\". Even if the album is not as good as those two, it definitely deserves mention and praise. Like many of the best from Wu, the albums majority is produced by Rza, only one track is not a rza production. The albums beats sound significantly different then those of previous Rza produced albums, including a few more soul samples. The album offers almost all of the clan's members with most songs featuring raekwon and many with cappadonna. Ghost also proves on this album he is one of the most talented mc's in the clan with his gambino flow which also raekwon uses. The album opens up with a long movie sample and then goes into one of the best tracks on the album \\"Iron Maiden\\", which features two very good verses from Raekwon and Ghostface and a decent one from Cappadonna which doesn't flow over Rza's excellent beat like the other two do. One of my favorite songs on the album is \\"260\\" which has a very intertesting horn sounding beat with a soul sample as well. I think this song really shows the creativity of Rza as a producer and the artistic view of the entire clan, beats like this are what seperate the group from other Hip-Hop acts. The following song is the dark \\"Assassination Day\\" which starts off a little lighter and then goes into the darkness which is first rapped over by INS The rebel who of course, throws in a sick verse. Rza also spits on the track and he also leaves a heavy dent with another sick verse. Ghost and Raekwon do the same. \\"Daytona 500\\" takes the same path as \\"Iron Maiden\\" though not quite as good, still one of the best on the album. Towards the end the album seems to get a bit more personal as Ghost spits more about his life. A very good but unexpected track from a wu record is \\"All that I Got is You\\" featuring Mary J Blige. The beat consists of basically a piano and violin but is put together very well. It is one of the best slow hip-hop joints of all time. Lyrically, Ghost speaks about his rough life growing up and Mary J, who at this point had already done tracks with Wu Members (All I Need Remix with Meth), adds an excellent R&B chorus. \\"Ironman\\" takes a little bit different path then other solo wu projects but stays true to wu criteria. It has beats very different then what is mostly out there and is lyrically excellent. The album deserves a much higher level of respect then it gets. I will admit, when I first bought it I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is, but with a few listens, it definitely proves its greatness. It does have its dull parts, but overall it is amongst the best from Wu, Period.
B00004VWA7|4.0|This album is absolutely amazing! You can listen to the first ten seconds of \\"Donna Lee\\", right from the opening hit of the drums, through to the beauty of \\"Forgotten Love\\" and realize this is some pretty hot stuff!<br />Best tracks are \\"Continuum\\", \\"Portrait Of Tracy\\", \\"Okonkole Y Trompa\\" and \\"Forgotten Love\\". \\"Kuru/Speak Like A Child\\" ain't bad either.<br />The bonus tracks are alright, but the general album is more interesting.<br />In my opinion, one of the most accomplished works by one of the most accomplished, if not the accomplished player of all time!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Ok  well a lot of you people seem to be posting reviews without hearing a note.  Well the girl can sing... ya you heard me she can!!!  I think this is an EXCELLENT album that makes you happy simply put if your feeling blu pop in, in the zone call all your friends and it'll be all good and if not jam to everytime and feel the pain with her.  5/5 baby<BR>NOTE TO PEOPLE- Get a life and relize she's still #1
B00006V9A0|5.0|This is a great CD buy a great band some people dont like it just because it has all the popular songs, but the only reason they are popular is because they are good songs. I do agree though that there could have been more songs. and to you fred dustsnumberonefan or whatevere youre name is they cant be jumping on any bandwagons because they started the whole grunge music scene without Nirvana most of youre precios bands wouldn't even exist. oh and i have read some of youre reviews and they don't even make sense! citizen kane was a great movie
B0000B3FCX|5.0|This band in many of these songs create hard rock and soft songs that you can tell only professionals can do. My personal favorite is &quot;Throw Yourself Away&quot;, this song probably has the most efficient sound from the same dudes who brought you &quot;Hero&quot;. Combining heavy guitars and a drum beat that would get any hard rock fan goin, this song is my favorite. This whole cd is great in my opinion, a perfect 5.
0451167716|5.0|Obviously, it doesn't take much to find out that Puzo's The Godfather is a good book. It is one of the most famous books ever written, and the classic organized crime book. Yet, the beauty of the whole story, really lies in it's simplicity. <br />I'll start off with a small plot summary. Don't worry about spoiling anything; this is simply a sampler. The story is basically the life of Don Corleone, an aging don at the center of New York's most powerful crime family. The story chronicles his life as an established Don, and also goes through the lives of his children. It's broken up into five books (all within the same cover) which are really like large chapters. <br />Puzo's writing is unique in the sense that it keeps you marvelled without the use of really advanced vocabulary or long, winding sentences. His most powerful lines are usually only a few words long, and he replies on the plot and the story, rather than the way the story is told. This is good for a number of reasons, the two main ones being that it makes for a 'lighter read' and the other being it takes a less intelligent person to read it. (No offense to anyone on the last line!) <br />He delivers from back to front a variety of examples of mob business, and introduces a host of interesting and realistic characters. When someone says the characters &quot;jump off the page&quot; this is exactly the kind of book they're talking about. <br />I'm going to finish with a character listing, as I'm trying to give you a feel for the book without spoiling anything. There are some incredible twists in the story, which means just another reason you would want to read the Godfather. <br />Don Corleone: Extremely clever, built the entire Corleone empire, and is now aging quickly into semi-retirement <br />Sonny Corleone: The Don's son, he is aggressive and dominant, most think he will someday run the Corleone family. <br />Fredo Corleone: The Don's middle son, he is somewhat of a comic relief, and doesn't really fit into the family's usual 'business'. <br />Micheal Corleone: Joined the war against his father's will, although rebellious, he is also smart and courageous, possessing some of the traits of his father. <br />Tom Hagan: Adopted son of Don Corleone. He is not Sicillian, but serves as a lawyer to the family. <br />Luca Brasi: (Not a major character, but a personal favorite) The family hammer, Brasi has 'made his bones' long ago and is the family's number one hitman. <br />This is a small selection of a large cast of characters. I'm not going to list other characters, as I'm unsure of exactly how the story begins and what order it flows in, so I don't want to give away anything that would ruin the book. <br />I have also read several other Puzo novels, and although some are better than others, I have found only one I prefer better than the Godfather. That is &quot;Fools Die&quot; which is a similiar story with much less romance and more of the mob deals we all love to read about.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|I've listened to S.B. for 4 years now.  I thought &quot;Snow&quot; was fantastic!  But this, my friends, BLOWS EVERYTHING ELSE AWAY!  This is one of the best cd's I've ever heard (and I've been listening to music for 30+ years).  Emotional and heartfelt, the lyrics tell of Neal's spiritual awakening.  I'm not religious (in the traditional sense-in other words, I'm not a holy roller!), but this conveys Neal's message without being preachy!  Besides, the best music is always personal and connects the artist with the listener.  This scores on all counts!<br />The music is the best progressive rock that I've heard since the mid 70's!  Totally original, with hints of Kansas.  GREAT use of orchestration.<br />If you love great music, buy this cd!  Way to go, Neal!
0385504209|2.0|Dan Brown had some interesting historical insight on the brotherhoods and of Da Vinci's life.  However, the story is very predictable, especially after all the attention it has received.  If you like this type of story, you should read Katherine Neville's books &quot;The Eight&quot; &amp; &quot;Magic Circle&quot;.  She does a much better job in concocting a story line that keeps you on your toes.
B0000CFW87|4.0|To ultimate stardom!  That voice is just getting better and bette and it was excellent to start out with.  The songs are well chosen to suit his voice and to show off his improving range and ability.<br />You Raise Me Up has got to be the best song on the album, in my opinion.  It just touches my heart, like Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring did in his first album.<br />I highly recommend this CD and encourage Mr. Groban to keep up the great work and to keep adding those inspirational tunes coming!
B000000W5N|5.0|This is a truly great LP; I join the consensus. I love \\"Moonlight Mile,\\" \\"Sister Morphine,\\" \\"Dead Flowers,\\" \\"I Got the Blues,\\" \\"Can't You Hear Me Knockin'\\" and \\"Sway.\\"  The whole album is a wonder that grows better with the years.<br />I want to focus on the most well-known track, \\"Brown Sugar.\\"  Has there ever been a more politically incorrect hit song?  This great rock anthem is a stew of racism, sadism, sexism, violence and cruelty.  The lyrics are quite audible, though mixed in such a way that they don't reveal themselves all at once.  Plus, the words are so fluidly literate, they are unexpected, so a lot of fans might not really think they're hearing what they're hearing--an excited account of the life and times of a \\"slaver\\"--a guy who delivered slaves to market.<br />By comparison, Randy Newman's \\"Sail Away,\\" which is on a related theme, seems both safer and more obvious.  And that's my point about the Stones.  As they are being recalled now, the emphasis is on the great music, the greatness of Jagger as a singer and icon, Richards and Watts as musicians; their longevity, and their image of sexuality, satanism and \\"bad boy\\" appeal.  What's forgotten is they were also among the smartest satirists in rock.  Their earlier stuff from the Andrew Loog Oldham period, is full of snot-nosed sarcasm, making the same social points as Bob Dylan, but with far more humor.  Like Randy Newman, Ray Davies and Warren Zevon, they often adopted obnoxious, loathesome or dangerous characters to portray in their songs, and they both give the devils their due, and enough rope with which to hang themselves.<br />\\"Brown Sugar\\" is the song where they take this strategy to the absolute limit--rubbing everyone's nose in as much of it as they can get away with, forcing the listener to, in a way, identify with the evil pleasures enjoyed by someone with the whip-hand of power.  It's brilliant, scary, and devilishly ironic--a dimension of the Stones that is hardly credited enough by critics and fans.tics and fans.
B00004U2GH|5.0|What can you say about this one?  Read the other reviews for more in depth commentary.  I'm just saying you need to own this one.
B00005JLWN|5.0|A very good movie. This is an awsome action flick that deals with the necessity of human emotion, and it pulls it off. In a futuristic totalitarian government of the world, humans must take a pill that voids them of emotion or &quot;feeling&quot;. This is done for the effort of stopping the fourth world war, yes the fourth, because the third has already happened. Those who do not conform face death at the hands of the elite law enforcers called &quot;Grammaton Clerics&quot; who use a deadly form of martial art involving two pistols and a set of mathematically coordinated movements that optimizes the fighter. this martial art is caled &quot;Gun Kata&quot; which is a unique new action capability that captures the possibilities of future combat. This movie easily competes with &quot;The Matrix&quot; without using the new bullet time cliche. And, contary to popular opinion, there is not a gun fight over the rescue of a puppy dog, though a puppy dog is involved, it is completly justified. This movie kicks off when one of the Grammaton Clerics stops taking medication and finds out just how valuble human emotion really is. A good performance by Christian Bale and an amazing, if short, performance by Sean Bean
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Maiden fans rejoice! The latest Iron Maiden record brings the same punch and power from previous recordings but with the fresh melodies of 18 guitar strings that provide the tunes with a more elaborate sound.<br />Truly refreshing, the first song ever co-written by Nicko McBrain, &quot;New Frontier&quot; has that characteristic &quot;old-new&quot; mixture of the 21st century Maiden, as well as the epic &quot;Monts&eacute;gur&quot;.<br />Great album for Iron Maiden fans, keep it up Bruce, Steve, Jannick, Adrian, Nicko and Dave. UP THE IRONS! FROM NICARAGUA!
B00008GKEG|5.0|The best rock n roll documentary by its finest practicioners.  When the TV<BR>'Anthology' aired in 1995 that was pretty amazing enough, then came the VHS set with four more hours not shown on TV.  Now with the DVD Anthology, Beatles fans get all that and more (particularly of interest on the bonus disc is seeing and hearing Paul, George &amp; Ringo jam on early rock n roll songs, and<BR>then in Abbey Road studios discussing the making of &quot;Tommorow Never Knows&quot;).   Also what I thought especially of interest is how they very carefully placed John's video and audio contributions at the right moments (as they did also with the Anthology book, which I also recommend as a companion to the DVD set).
B00005JLK1|3.0|Hum...tired premise, with nothing new!  I felt rather \\"lied to\\" when I saw actors the caliber of Gabriel Byrne and Julianna Margulies was in the film. I thought wow...maybe this is will be a high class horror film.  It has great production values and fine acting, but well, duh, from the time they step onto the ship it was down hill on roller skates.  In fact, with some small changes this is a rehash of Death Ship (a sad puppy) made in 1980 with Nick Macusso, Richard Crenna and George Kennedy.<br />Bryne and Crew are salvagers and they run into - literatlly - a missing oceanliner loaded with gold and deadly ghosts.<br />The effects are good, and the thrills solid, but just so nothing new.  Buy it used, or catch it on telly, for once is enough.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I used to hate Eminem, but now I think he's cool. I enjoy being shocked. And there's a lot of 'shocking' lyrics on this CD that I just can't get enough of. I don't like rap music very much, but with Eminem, I'll make an exception. He's a white guy who can rap in the most entertaining way. Some of his songs are disturbing, like \\"Kim\\", where he sings about killing his wife for cheating on him. Others are just plain funny. My favorite song on this whole CD is \\"The Way I Am\\", which is the only one I truly take seriously. It really makes me think. This CD is definetly worth a listen. However, if you're very religious or easily offended, don't get this album. It contains some VERY EXPLICIT LYRICS!!! I don't even like the idea of children listening to Eminem. He's one heck of an entertainer but a terrible role model for children.
0385508417|3.0|This book took me a few hours to read. Although it was enjoyable and he does have points, I did agree that at times annoying. I agree, this time of year is frustrating. People have forgotten what Christmas really is, along with just enjoying family and friends. Everyone gets so caught up in decorating, and presents. I do however would have liked to see an alternate ending.. It bombed at the end for me, although the neighborly thing was nice.
B0000AFX64|5.0|When the original series of Battlestar Galactica came out in 1978, I was glued to the television set each week.  I loved Star Wars and other science fiction, and I fell in love with this one, too.  Of course, I was a young boy then, and loved the battle scenes, the Vipers, the shiny enemies, and the simple story lines.  The plot was basic and simple -- betrayal, survival, hope for the future.<br />The assembly of the fleet of 220 ships was a marvel of science fiction for its time.  The fleet, including the Galactica, were assembled from various pieces of other models, and this was really in keeping with the story line of assembling a fleet out of suriviving remnants.<br />The casting of Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict and Lorne Greene were inspired.  Of the trio, only Lorne Greene was well known to television audiences, and not for science fiction at that.  The supporting cast gave the show a community feel that made the viewer care for the people.  Of course, this becomes a problem similar to Star Trek in that none of the major characters could ever be killed off.  I guess all science fiction that is episodic suffers from this.<br />This particular DVD is a re-cut of the pilot.  It was made and released as a feature film, somewhat shorter than the television pilot.  However, the cinematography and sound was redone for theaters, which makes this a good DVD to have even if you have the larger series set.  There are more scenes in the other offering, but there is value in this one, too, given the remastering.<br />The music from Stu Phillips is memorable, and the effects from John Dykstra of Star Wars and Close Encounters fame are remarkable for their time, and, too a large extent, hold up well against today's standards.<br />The story is basic -- the colonies have been destroyed, along with the defensive fleet, except for one battlestar, the colonial equivalent to a battleship/aircraft carrier combination.  Fugitive ships begin assembling from among the survivors, but first they must find supplies and a destination.

B00009V7RF|4.0|I read A lot of people criticing this album becuase it is not what they are used to hearing from the Black Eyed Peas. It does have a more vibe pop feeling to it (partly because Timberlake is singing Background vocals on where is the love). The addition of the beautiful Fergie adds a different feeling to this music, which makes it good in my opinion. Also people have been critizing this album because it is degrading of people with handicaps (Track 3 Lets Get Retarded). That is one of the most laughable things Ive heard in my laugh. Lets get retarded is about as bad as saying Lets get hype or something along those lines. If they says Cripples suck or something like that then I would see it was time to break out the picketing signs. Take My Advice and listen to this album before you take into consideration dumb comments like that.
B000024D4R|1.0|I'm sorry. I know this is a classic disc, and it is scowled upon to defile the sacred ground of &quot;classic&quot;-ness with a different view, but this album just isn't that good. This album sees Roger Waters getting more controlling and egotistical resulting in a big, big flaw, his voice. Roger Waters cannot sing. WYWH and DSOTM see Gilmore or Gilmore and a harmony track doing the lion's share (if not all) of the vocal work. Water's voice is shrill, often times waivers to sour notes and not totally under control. By deciding to take the forefront with vocals and total songwriting on this disc, he hurts the band by making the music take a back seat to his ego. Above and beyond vocals, musically this album is mediocre at best. It lacks the vision and sonic experimentally of WYWH and DSOTM. The album takes far to few chances and is lacking in the PF-hallmark harmonies of the aforementioned discs. This album, all in all, ends up being a mediocre &quot;classic rock&quot; disk, with little innovation and nothing ground breaking. If you think Eric Clapton &quot;rocks&quot; then this disc may be for you, but if the same brand that brought you &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; wafting into quasi-blues-70s-standard-rock sounds a tad bit unapealling, go grab something else instead.

B000089RVR|4.0|The first Dido album was very, very good. It was a smashing hit and not only people bought loads of it, but also the radio stations, tv shows etc were airing the songs over and over again. The songs from &quot;No Angel&quot; became almost classic. Dido's voice immediately recognizable to anyone's ear. It is very tough for someone who had this success in a first album to repeat it on the second release.<br />Dido did a great job with &quot;life for rent&quot;. Her voice is still soft and sweet, the songs are very nice and elegant. The album is still a very good buy, but it is very hard to compare it to &quot;No Angel&quot;. The element of surprise is not anymore there, you already know what to expect. That's the only problem with it. Apart from that, it is a very good buy.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I have to admit that though I knew Alicia was talented, I was not feelin' her first album, but after I heard \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" I was converted.  I am so glad someone is takin' the sound back to the days when music was MUSIC.  I may not have lived in the 70's, but that is what I was raised on and she threw down.  Hopefully this true talent will put some of these screaming-squalling, half-naked, sex - not music - selling wannabe talents out of the running.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Before I give this sterling review, let me qualify myself as someone who never heard At the Drive In before... I always wanted to, just never got around to it.<br />Anywho... with that said, I heard about TMV from a compilation sampler disc from a british magazine.  It had some great bands on it that it claimed was the &quot;best&quot; that 2003 had to offer.  Included among The Darkness, The Stereophonics, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds was The Mars Volta.  Never heard of 'em... they don't get much airtime in the Burgh (not that I really listen to mainstream radio anymore).  I was literally blown away by what I heard, so I bought their album thinking that what I heard on the compilation would be the best the album had to offer.  I am soooo glad I was wrong.<br />So, what makes The Mars Volta such a remarkable band can be summed up as such:  We have heard music like this in the 70s and early 80s, but the groups from which music of this type can be likened to have nothing on The Mars Volta.  I'm talking early Floyd, Rush, Yes...  The Mars Volta are the best new band of 2003...hell, maybe the last twenty years.<br />Just listen to the guitar work on all the songs... you really think anyone else in the industry can make music like this?  Many have tried, most have failed... but Omar succeeds.  There is literaly so much going on in each of these symphonic rock pieces that it can be hard to catch everything the first or second time around.  My advice: Listen to this album all the way through once... then let it sink in for about an hour... then pop it in once again.  I think it is impossible to not listen to this disc all the way through, like Pringles, once you pop... you can't stop.<br />One of the major complaints about this album has been about the lyrics.  As being someone who has dealt with the music industry for a handfull of years, complex lyrics can mean the death of your band.  You as a musician should want the average joe listener to understand the spoken poetry that you gracefully pour out... and that's just it, the &quot;average joe listener&quot;... This amazing work of art is not for the average joe... this album was made specifically for those people who want more from their music... just like Omar and Cedric, who were tired of the same old sounding rock recycled over and over... there are plenty of bands out there making plenty of moolah doing the same thing... The Mars Volta are in a class by themselves.

In that way, I could help my dying friend and I learned that I could help my living friend and other living friends even more by being present with them and helping them to find out what is important in life.  We are all on a journey, and finding out the truth of life opens up so many possibilities.  This book will help anyone who is a student of life.
B000002UE9|5.0|Say what you like but Poison have released the ultimate party album Open Up And Say Aah.Like Motley Crue,Poison isnt deep but they are extremely entertaining.With the even better Flesh And Blood,Poison have proved that they are indeed fascinating and talented.Every Rose Has Its Thorn and Nothin But A Good Time are their best hits but theres stuff on this disc for everyone.Nuff said.
0451450523|5.0|This little book is simply a remarkable and enjoyable read.  The adventure is interesting, and the life lessons are challenging.  More than a fantasy about a unicorns journey to find out where the unicorns have vanished, it is a tale about inner courage and sacrifice.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone, regardless of their tastes in reading.  It will make you think about what is important in life.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|The first X-Men set not only set the stage for more movies, it gave the genral public a nice glimpse of Stan Lee's Mutants.<br />X2 pushes the limits when it comes to screenplay, special effects and storyline.<br />Nightcrawler is a VERY welcome character. And they do a wonderful job of using him throughout the entire movie. The opening scene is perhaps one of the coolest in film of late.<br />Can't wait till X3!!!
1577311523|5.0|The book in and of itself is excellent. Of course what he says will be similar to some things you have read-- there a variety of paths for different people!  That is no surprise-- so much of spirituality overlaps! (duh!) <br />I know people who have never had any background in any spiritual context read it-- and the excellent part of the book is that he does not focus from ANY certain type of dogma or religious standpoint.  He lets the words speak for themselves.<br />However, I believe the message he presents is timeless (pun intended). Some say they don't know how to start or what to do after reading the book.  Listen to yourself. Trust yourself. That's the biggest step.  I have been in chronic pain for over a year, where I have had problems even standing up, walking and so on, and I am only 25 years old.  This book has helped me reshape my view of my experience.  This book is not for everyone-- it will require self reflection, honesty about self and even make you start listening to your intuition.  If you're not willing to do those things, don't get the book.  <br />Bottom line?  I say read it, and if there's something you don't agree with, leave it for someone else to look at.  This book is a tool for self discovery, reflection, and ultimately, changing your life, moment by moment.  Take the wisdom you can get from it. Don't agree with everything?  Big deal! That's okay! Get the wisdom you CAN from it! <br />If you're ready, here is a book that will be able to help you on your path, and a definite classic to add to your spiritual or helpful library.
B00005OM4N|4.0|This CD really grew on me. At first, I only liked the songs &quot;I'm A Slave For You&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot;, but as time went on, I really enjoyed more and more of the CD. The best songs are &quot;I'm A Slave For You&quot;, &quot;Boys&quot;, &quot;Let Me Be&quot;, and &quot;Anticipating.&quot; While the album version of &quot;Overprotected&quot; is good, the Darkchild remix (available on Now That's What I Call Music! 10) blows it out of the water. Some other standouts, yet not as good as the previously mentioned songs are &quot;I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman&quot;, &quot;Bombastic Love&quot;, and &quot;Lonely&quot;. The rest of the CD is pretty good also. As far as Britney CD's go, this CD is up there is quality. It is a nice step for the pop-princess, yet she perfects her move in this year's &quot;In The Zone&quot; (highly recommended). This CD is well worth the money. The songs are, actually, pretty fun to dance to. The CD barely ever slows down (only on I'm Not A Girl..) and keeps up the fun. I definitely recommend checking this CD out, it's really good. Enjoy!
B00004CYXY|4.0|This is a good film with an ok plot. But if you dont like any of the acotrs and dont like mind games dont get this. But on the hole it has some great acting (on Gary Kemps parts) so if you are a fan of any of the actors get it.
B00008H2LB|2.0|This band isn't talented, or anything new. They're playing the same post-grunge that's been in the mainstream for years. Linkin Park does the same rap-rock that bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Rage Against the Mashine have been playing for years, but with less variety and talent. In my experiences when you're trying to create musical fusion you have to be virtuosistic, open minded, and you don't try to flaunt it hoping for mainstream acceptance. For some reason the fact that Linkin Park &quot;OMG raps to guitatrs!!11&quot; is a major selling point for this band, I don't know why this mainstream hybrid rock is so popular, it's not very different from normal alternative rock.<br />All and all this album has the usual faked angst, dutuned power chords and catchy hooks to make the audience jump. I don't like this album, but as long as others do it's fine by me. If you want to hear some dense, complex and heavy music than listen to Liquid Tension Experiment or Meshuggah, they will blow your mind wide open if you're impressed by &quot;LP&quot;
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Ok, I am an old school Sarah fan, a &quot;fumbler&quot;, basically a Sarah-maniac. You better believe I have been waiting as long as anyone for this record to be released. And when it was I thought, wow, good, amazing to hear Sarah again, but not &quot;amazing&quot; itself. But after a month or so of listening to it every couple days, then everyday, then several times a day, all I have are praises to heap on this album. It is beautiful, catchy, upbeat, somber all at once. I mean it runs the gauntlet while all the while staying very melodic and peaceful. This is a perfect comeback from Sarah, and I can't wait for the tour. Listening to her belt out &quot;Stupid&quot; is gonna be so sweet! Fave Tracks: Answer, Train Wreck, Dirty Little Secret, but I love em all!!
B00006RU5B|2.0|I expected MUCH better from &quot;RageGarden&quot; (heh). They stripped RATM of their vitrol-spewing frontman and replaced him with the awful over-singing of Chris Cornell. Chris Cornell was great in Soundgarden, probably one of the greatest vocalists ever. Cornell souds like he's trying to imitate the ferocious growl of Zach De Larocha. He should stick to his awesome pre-Audioslave voice.<br />Now on to the instruments. In RATM everyone was great, Tim C. had his creative and funky bass-lines. Brad is a thunderously-minimalistic drummer. And Tom was there to fill in the upper register with his insane noises. In Audioslave the whole band seems to have quieted down and let the vocals be the main feature, which was a bad move in my eyes, because Cornell's vocals are hard to bear (even for a death metal fan like myself)<br />Overall two musically (and politically) great bands seem to have amalgamated into a mediocre alt-rock band with unbearably religious lyrics at times (I prefer Deicide's or Cannibal Corpse's lyrics). Catchy stuff, but with none of the substance or emotion you got from Soundgarden. Listen to &quot;Cochise&quot; and &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; and you'll see what I mean.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|&quot;Me?  I want what's coming to me...  The world, Chico--and everything in it.&quot; - Tony Montana<br />&quot;Scarface&quot; was a box-office flop when it first came out and was literally trashed by almost every film critic that you can think of.  Many years later, it's considered a classic and some say it's one of the most influential gangster movies to ever to be made.  There's real power that cannot be denied that is held within this amazing masterpiece that has one of the highest replay values I've ever experienced.  I can NEVER get tired of this outstanding gangster epic, and it is a grand event that stands out from most crime sagas--and most films althogether.<br />Tony Montana came to America with nothing, with the exception of a dream to become a somebody; a successful and powerful somebody.  He turns to a life of crime and slowly but surely becomes a well-established gangster. However, Tony becomes greedier and more consumed with power as the days go by, and it's only a matter of time before he starts to want it all.  His &quot;wanting it all&quot; leads him to his ultimate demise that will consume his fate.  This is a story about starting with nothing and then having everything--only to lose it all in then end.<br />Words cannot even begin to describe how passionately I feel about this movie.  This is a crime saga that has layers of character and story.  It isn't just a senseless bloodbath with mindless violence around every corner.  No, this movie has a certain path and structure.  Al Pacino literally makes the role of &quot;Tony Montana&quot; his own and never loses sight of it for a second.  I can't think of another character that is &quot;impersonated&quot; in the real world more than Pacino's &quot;Tony Montana.&quot;  The film is brilliantly written by Oliver Stone (who deemed this movie as his farewell to cocaine), and is perfectly executed by director Brian DePalma.  This film had an amazing cast and crew behind it, which made it the success that it is today.<br />This Two-Disk Anniversary Edition is fully packed with some great extras.  One of the main things that is so great about the DVD is the incredible audio and picture transfer that is COMPLETELY superb in contrast with the older version.  While it's easier to note the difference in picture with a bigger (and perhaps even a widescreen) television, you should still be able to tell the difference and come to the conclusion that this new transfer is much better than the original.  Extra features included are deleted scenes, documentaries, a &quot;TV Version&quot; montage that is absolutely priceless, and a hip-hop feature that shows interviews with some of today's hottest rappers and how they deem this movie as a &quot;ghetto classic.&quot;  While the DVD could've had a few more extra features, it is in no way disappointing.<br />&quot;Scarface&quot; is a timeless classic that seems to get bigger and bigger as the years roll by.  It's a rare breed of film that can never be duplicated in a successful manner.  I find it truly amazing how a film started off so weak when it first came out only to become the legend that it is today.  If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend that you give it a viewing as soon as possible.  It is, and forever will be, one of my absolute favorites.at it is today.<br />This Two-Disk Anniversary Edition is fully packed with some great extras.

0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown brilliantly uses a fictional plot to reveal a historical theory that if true would be nothing short of revolutionary.  The only other book I can compare this to is Galileo Galilei's \\"Dialogue concerning the two chief world-systems\\"  in which Galileo used a fictional argument to challenge the strongly held belief that the earth was the center of the universe.  Dan Browns research is intrinsically laid out with historical details and connections that are hard to argue.  It is true that his theory has been borrowed from others, though this only adds to its credibility as both a historical document and a masterpiece of fiction.  I can only assume that Dan Brown chose a fictitious format because what he reveals is so sensitive that a strictly non-fiction format would be nothing short of suicide.  What is astounding is that not only is the theory he lays out so profound and life altering, but that he manages to reveal this information in a truly enthralling murder mystery. The research and thought that it reveals is truely inspiring. As far as the religious controversy, all I can say is the following...<br />&quot;Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blind-folded fear.&quot;<br />-Thomas Jefferson<br />\\"Religion consists in a set of things which the average man thinks he believes and wishes he was certain of.\\"<br />Mark Twain (1835 - 1910)<br />\\"Nothing can be more contrary to religion and the clergy than reason and common sense.\\"- Voltaire<br />I say, read this book with an open mind and then judge for yourself with reason whether the story is truth or fiction.  Question the motives of those who disapprove of the message it provides.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I wasn't really into rock music until my friend gave me this CD, and it changed my taste in music completely. The album isn't repetitive at all so I could listen to it all day long. Jack White is an amazing guitarist and the bass notes boom out of the speaker. My favorite songs are &quot;Hypnotise&quot; and &quot;The Air Near My Fingers&quot;, but each track is awesome and unique. I like how the instruments are simple, too--just a drummer and one guitarist. I can't say that I understand all of the lyrics because they're a little weird, but well-written and exceedingly creative. If you like rock music, buy this CD because you won't be disappointed!!
B000006OS2|1.0|This is one of my all time favourite John Wayne movies.  I have tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase it on DVD in Canada. Finally, I decided to import a copy.  BIG MISTAKE!  What I hoped would be a pleasurable evening's entertainment quickly deteriorated when I saw the dreadful quality (or lack of quality) of this DVD.  I have seen worn out rental VHS tapes that far exceed the quality of this particular DVD.  The manufacturer should be embarrassed by the poor quality of this offering.  I rate this copy at one star only because there is nothing lower.  Those seeking this entertaining title should save their money and await the release of a copy of McLintock that is worthy of the Duke.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly was much maligned when it was first aired. Critics savaged it which, in retrospect, seems highly unfair. They were expecting Buffy in outer space and what Josh Whedon gave them was an update of Wagon Train to the stars (or what Star Trek might have been if the franchise hadn't become stuffy over time). Firefly showed great potential which is precisely why Fox gunned it down; Fox the network that once let dark horse series find an audience became as conversative and musty as CBS.<br />In the two hour pilot we're introduced to the basic concept of the series; five centuries have passed. There's been a civil war. Our heroes were on the losing side and now making a living  carrying illegal and legal merchandise. They're not bad guys and have a code of honor not too dissimilar to the code of gunfighters in the old west. The characters are appealing, interesting and well played by the cast.<br />Fox's miscalculation is, in one sense, the fan's gain; evidently Whedon is planning a film at some point in the future. It's just as well as Firefly was too clever and intelligent for Fox and most of the viewers and critics that caught the show all too briefly in its 11 episode run. The DVD picture and sound quality is very, very good. The extras include a gag reel, featurette, screen test and commentaries on a number of episodes.<br />The big bonus, though, is the inclusion of 3 never before seen episodes of the series that didn't air after it was canceled. I'm surprised that Sci-Fi Channel didn't pick this up (but then again Sci-Fi usually demands a portion of ownership now prior to agreeing to run a series--a factor that probably played into the remake of Battlestar: Galatica). It's a pity that Sci-Fi chose to remake Battlestar:Galatica vs. continuing this fine series. A number of questionable choices have been made at both networks although the cancelation of Firefly without giving the series a fair chance was probably Fox's biggest blunder for new shows of the 2002 season.<br />In reinventing the space opera, Whedon crafted a terrific, intelligent and well written series. It's a pity that no one else realized it.season.<br />In reinventing the space opera, Whedon crafted a terrific, intelligent and well written series. It's a pity that no one else realized it.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|i love her new cd!  i also love the production - very smooth and nice on the ears.  forget the bad reviews!
B0000025DD|3.0|To me this one sounds somewhat strain-free and insincere. <BR>I expected more intense feelings from Gilmour, so I liked &quot;About Face&quot; much more. <br />Recording quality could be better too (OK, I am picky)
B000068TPN|5.0|I just finished viewing this film, alone.  All these years later my wife cannot watch them.  She spent too many praying that her husband would be sent over.  Her prayers were answered.<br />To those experts who say that the combat was impossible to believe, the enemy would not come out in the open and fight in the fashion shown in the film, I trust that Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore would not let Hollywood get too far out of line in their dramatizations.<br />I also remember that in 1965 the North Viet Namese army was as arrogant and overconfident in their estimation of the American's as warriors as Robert McNamara was of the NVA.  <br />This film captured the emotions and the horror of war as well as any I have seen.  It tells a story that could not be forgotten because it was never told.  The story of a commander leading troops into battle with courage and conviction.  The story of men serving their country with valor and distinction.<br />Want to know why we lost that one?  Notice the civilian who was more worried about &quot;keeping this under wraps&quot; when the battle was going the wrong way.  The rear echelon command that was ready to send them in without proper enemy estimates and then ready to pull them out without any thought to their men's exposure to enemy assault while trying to board helicopters.  This movie captures what went wrong.  The troops in action won and the command withdrew - all on the advice of civilian Think Tank pundits.<br />This movie depicts the horror and heroism of the conflict.  I mourn for the families of the men were lost and honor their courage.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is a sleeper.  I never knew it was on Fox and it got cancelled before I saw a single episode.  But, when the series came out on dvd, I took a chance and was I surprised!  It is excellent.  Top of the line.  Good story lines.  Solid supporting cast.  The episodes seemed to be getting better and better and then they cancelled it.  Man, why do they always cancel the good ones and the bad sitcoms go on and on.  Go figure.  Anyway, I have watched all but one of the episodes so far and every one has been excellent!  I'm a science fiction buff from when I was a kid and this one is a keeper.
B00009MGQL|1.0|As a Beck fan since the 70's, I'm completely baffled by the Amazon rating some people have given this album. I have to guess that record companies see a cheap way to boost sales by sneaking in some &quot;independent&quot; reviews. This album has a few nice Jeff Beck licks here and there but no cut is left untouched by post production looping and sampling. I'm a guitar player since the early 70's and I've got all his albums so I've got no reason to slam Jeff. I just find this album to be a worst case scenerio for what production can do for/to an artist.<br /> I've read interviews where Jeff indicates he's not pleased either and wants to go back to a more direct recording process, (see Guitar Player, 2003 cover issue). I just hold out hope that he responds with a follow up that features more guitar work and less post production glitz. If you are a newby to Beck's music, Check out WIRED as a great place to start. I saw Jeff and his group in Atlanta this year and they were incredible as a simple 3 piece band.
B000001FS3|5.0|U2 have continued producing great albums into the new decade, but &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; remains the classic that really made their presence known to the world. It is a masterpiece of melodic brilliance and just wonderful music. It manages to incorporate almost everything that's good about rock n' roll from it's blues, gospel, folk and even hints of metal into one epic statement of grace and power. Like &quot;Achtung Baby,&quot; &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; shows each member of the band doing their best with their sections like few albums do. &quot;Where The Streets Have No Name&quot; is still a soaring achievement, a classic opening of driving melody, Bono's powerful vocals, the Edge's frantic yet passive guitar and Larry Mullen Jr.'s  rhythmic beats. It is said that &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; was U2's truly first journey into American music, previously their influences were more along the lines of Patti Smith, here they dig into the mountain of sounds that are traditionally American. &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; for example, is an all-out gospel song where Bono shows his great range. &quot;Bullet The Blue Sky&quot; is more fire and passion, a roaring assault with Zeppelinsque guitars from The Edge and Bono sounding more ferocious than he had or has. Yet the album achieves moments of grace, such as &quot;In God's Country&quot; wich has fast guitar licks, but it somehow achieves a more dreamy, almost blissful tone. &quot;With Or Without You&quot; is a beautiful ballad, one of U2's best cuts with an elegant guitar melody. &quot;Mothers Of The Disappeared&quot; is another one of the album's more evocative moments. &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; is one of the few albums from the past decade which achieved a classic level where it's not just a rock album, it's an album of defining, wonderous music. Anyone who appreciates good music would surely find the wonderful melodies, words and moments found in this album. &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; achieves what all great music does, a sound that is timeless.
0380977281|5.0|Stardust was an excellent book, truly a fairy tale for adults, and at most times appropriate for children.  The writing style strongly resembled that of CS Lewis in the Narnia Chronicles, with adventure building on adventure, and with magical creatures all along the way. There is also a hint of the style of Terry Pratchett's wry humor.  This makes for a very good combination. Once I was just part of the way through the book, I did not want to put it down until I finished it. It makes for a great escape and a fun time.
B0000CF30C|5.0|This review is specifially for the surround-sound mix of this famous album by Aerosmith, I have never listened to the stereo mix in my life. That being said, I highly recommend this SACD for it's nice surround mix of some classic rock and roll music. The surround mix of Sweet Emotion is just awesome, and Walk This Way now comes alive in a way that shakes the whole house and puts you right in the middle of the song. If you have a nice surround sound SACD system, I would highly recommend this disc. But there is a WARNING: This disc is a single layer SACD, it will not play on a CD player.
B00008EYA5|3.0|Highlights: Confident debut direction; well-adapted to the show; witty screenplay; griping action.<BR>Lowpoints: Absence of one single novel thing.<br />Conclusion: Unless you were a huge fan of the show, or simply adore Colin Farrell, chances are you'll find SWAT just another action movie. It does not falter or go wrong at any time, but also does not exceed expectations the least bit - enjoy the slam-bam action and laugh at the never-ending flow of humor (how else to keep an audience intrigued but placing handfuls of Sam Jackson/LL Cool J/Collin Farrell puns inbetween relentless action?) - you'd be better off watching 'Heat' or the original '48 Hours' though.
B00004STUL|1.0|This is a poor excuse of a movie.The plot was stupid and very boring.The stars of the movie are not believeable in their roles because they look silly and are comedians.The jokes were corny and lame.The action was okay but not very realistic.Im getting sick and tired of these black actors who like to act tough and give attitude only to appeal to a young audience who listen to hip hop.DO NOT BUY THIS DUMB MOVIE!!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Highlights: Direction; editing; performances; vibrant energy; controversial subject matter; superb ending<BR>Lowpoints: Its brutality might be misanderstood...<br />Conclusion: Don't let the one lowpoint I brought up misguide you - if you're an average film-lover, and honestly appreciate filmmaking, you will observe the violence in Fight Club as an essential aspect emphasizing the overall relentlessness of the film. Certain teen comedies nowadays have more blood-letting than 'Fight Club'. The title itself suggests the violent nature of the film, and as a result, it is not the main attribute of 'Fight Club' that will linger after the viewing. David Fincher ('Seven', 'The Game', 'Panic Room') astonishes with the confident way he leads his audience through over two hours of no-holds-barred, full-throttle controversial energy. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt's chemistry is as electric as the fight scenes of the radical Fight Club members; Helena Bohnam Carter fits in perfectly, her character both atrocious and sympathetic. If you're in for a uncompromising illustration of radical ideas on contemporary society, represented through an intelligent director's control over two of the best actors of their generation, that rivals the flabbergasting effects of Tarantino pictures, you can't, CAN'T go wrong with David Fincher's instant classic.
078401213X|2.0|This movie pi has a really good idea but it falls way short. Personally i am a math instructor and I value the math part. But the end is what really killed the movie. Also the end doesn't explain anything at all. I loved the whole insanity, drug, and the directing. &quot;Requiem&quot; is a much much better film. This one will leave you disappionted.
B000060P79|3.0|When I first heard this album, I thought of my little brother. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Simple Plan has cornered the market on angsty/wise guy sort of punk. The sound is clean and a little bit tongue in cheek.  This CD is meant to appeal to a younger age group, and it does it well. <BR>If you're fifteen, and the girl in math class won't even look at you, you'll think this CD is genius. If you're not, well. It's pop-y Canandain punk that is enjoyable, if a bit commercial.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|This 2003 release is certainly sonically better than its 1970 counter part.However I've got to believe that somewhere down that long and winding road(bare with me)all Beatles CDs will have such an improvement in sound. OK, so what's the incentive here?Well, in a sense it's a new Beatles CD and revisionist or not all principal parties agreed to this release. If you are a completist then you must purchase, regardless of whether you are delighted or disgusted by the alternate versions.As for my taste without going track by track, the sans strings and choir benefits &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; while the 1970 Spector produced &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is what I think closest to what the artist envisioned.The 2003 &quot;Let it Be&quot; is warmer but Harrison's guitar solo is substandard so is McCartney's voice on TLWR as is Lennon's on the restored &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;.Perhaps that's its charm and shows the band without studio wizardry(naked).But then not hearing the snippets of chatter between the songs detracts from the overall feeling of being &quot;live in the studio&quot; and is missed especially with the roof top recordings.This is particularly jarring with the abrupt endings. Ditto the missing coda for Get Back.I think they could have formatted this project better and missed a golden opportunity. One other mention, many people feel that somehow &quot;Let it Be&quot; whatever permutation is subpar Beatles material have got to be kidding.After all it only spawned three #1s.
0920668364|5.0|I was in a doctor's office waiting for my appointment, and I saw this little book sitting on the table. I picked it up and began to read; soon I was hooked. I tried to be cool, but by the time my appointment came, I was sheepishly drying tears with the sleeve of my leather jacket. The nurse told me that this was a common reaction to the book. A few years later, I bought a paperback copy and gave it to my own mother as a Mother's Day card. I didn't stick around for the tears I knew would come. She has it to this day. This book reminded me of so many things: the circle of support in loving families, the sacrifice of mothers, and the inheritance of love that bonds generations of strong families together. It made me love my mother even more and think of how much I owe her for helping me to become me, and for that, I am eternally grateful to her.
B000066I6N|4.0|I'm sorry if this review focuses mostly on the cover of Song to the Siren.  That drew me first to Plant's isle, as I haven't been overly excited about his solo work, after years of delight in Zeppelin.  The whole album has been a box of chocolates, each sweeter/tang-ier and more surprising than the next.  Mature, original handling of the blues, the embrace of roots combined with innovative arrangement, no bombast, or pretense, only thoughtful interpretations of songs famous and not-so.<br />As a diehard and realistic lover of Tim Buckley's seminal and unique music, I just had to hear what another favorite, so very different, would do with Buckley's most nakedly fatal and magnificent song.  Here is most of what I wrote:<br />prologue: buy Dreamland. the following comments about Plant are true for the whole fine album. Also, if you don't know Buckley, buy his Happy/Sad, Goodbye and Hello, Greetings from L.A., even Starsailor if you want to visit the cosmos and hear \\"Siren\\" in its purest version.  Each album is distinct from all others.  They're not easy listening, and they're not like anything else.<br />There are now quite a few covers of this greatly loved song by Tim Buckley. Dozens of songwriters treat it as a musical icon. Song to the Siren is arguably the purest expression of the yearning for and exile from oceanic bliss that was a central theme for the extraordinary singer. There are steadily increasing numbers of of new and re-releases of Buckley's studio and live recordings. The renaissance began more than a dozen years after his 1975 death, spurred on both by the tragic success of his late son, Jeff , a brilliant memoir by friend and lead guitarist Lee Underwood, and a few buried live coals of devotion from those who always loved his music. Still, there are many who discovered \\"Siren\\" from the version by This Mortal Coil, featured in a popular horror flick, and many who have never gone to the source (TB).<br />A cover of a great song is a great challenge, and love is not enough. Few people have ever had the vocal chops or naked passion that Buckley could bring to a song, nor the artistry; as a consequence, most of the covers of Siren that I have heard are simply not very good, no matter the sincerity they might convey. So what can one expect from an aging Robert Plant?<br />Surprise! I've always been a huge Zeppelin fan, not just for the joy of their power and aura, or the over-the-top musicianship of the members. Plant's yowl has been foully imitated and expanded by numerous rock singers; no one got the point. Plant balanced posturing with a love of the mystical, the untouchable, and a great deal of his singing conveyed a grasping ecstasy and richness of emotion. The voice has never been particularly about pitch or power, but has always been astringent and full of hidden flavors, like good gin. This quality has endured long after the pitch and volume have diminished.<br />Seemingly aware of exactly what his tool kit contains, Plant doesn't go ethereal, crooning or weepy, like in many of the other covers of Siren. Nor does he exaggerate the portentous wonderment-of-it-all as in Rain Song, Kashmir or No Quarter from his distant past. His voice, compact, understated but throwing off small rainbows of sound, like a sitar or a late-Beethoven quartet, deals out the fatal romanticism of Siren in precisely the opposite (is there such a thing?) manner as the expansive beauty of Buckley's original treatment. Add to that a pretty unusual and ear-catching instrumentation, and you have a perfect cover of an uncoverable song (hence the missing star). Plant makes it personal, and it works.d love is not enough.

0385484518|1.0|I heard so many good things about this book, I thought it would be something that changed my outlook on life. Instead, it was basically a sappy Lifetime movie in book form.<br />It was funny how Morrie ranted about the evils of money, considering he lived in an upscale suburb and hired a small army of caretakers who constantly tended him and his medical equipment. I'd like to see someone else in Morrie's situation who can't afford top-notch 24/7 in-home healthcare talking about how people shouldn't be so money-hungry.<br />Furthermore, the book was not at all persuasive considering the author did not address how Morrie's philosophy (which is that of pretty much every liberal college professor I've encountered) changed his life. And to my knowledge, it didn't. If Morrie couldn't sway the author despite their supposedly intimate relationship, how is his story supposed to have a strong effect on anybody else?<br />If you're the type to get worked up over Hallmark cards and soap operas, you'll like it. For everybody else, it's an overrated melodramatic waste of time.
B00000DG1R|5.0|In 1998, Duran Duran has issued a greatest-hits collection to replace 1989's \\"Decade\\", which was was great but \\"only\\" had 14 hits, ommitting \\"New Moon On Monday\\" and did not take into account their rebirth with \\"Ordinary World\\" and \\"Come Undone\\", among others. I also like that the songs in \\"Greatest\\" are not presented chronologically but rather take the approach that best suits the flow of their hits.<br />Now back to the band itself. Though '80s nostalgia is rampant, the truth is that Duran Duran grew from being a teeny bopper sensation to becoming one of the most profilic symbols of an era that in their case never went away. Only a few of their contemporaries managed to overcome and at the same time embrace their 80's roots. At the moment I can only think of one and that would be the band ABC.<br />The group first exploded into the music world with the advent of a little channel that used to play videos called MTV. They were camera ready and although they owe much of their success of their sexy videos, the music holds up much after the images of \\"Rio\\" leave your mind. They were not the most masculine of groups, wore make-up, and had that British thing that puts off a lot of the male audience, but somehow they made believers out of both girls and boys.<br />Duran Duran started they music journey with glam rock d&eacute;cor, progressed to new romanticism, and miraculously moved on to showcase a surprising sophistication as the 1980's turned into the '90s. They also toyed with electronica as exemplified by \\"Electric Barbarella\\".<br />All the chart-topping singles from the 1980's made them a force to be reckoned with are here and as I am listening to the CD right now the songs have aged very well and remind me that just because teenage girls loved them does not automatically make the band a flash in the pan.<br />I highly recommend this release to anyone who likes Duran Duran and to those who may not know them but love pop music. These guys have what it takes and this release gives one a solid overview of must-have songs. More hard core fans may want to try and find Duran Duran's hard to find 2 CD set titled \\"Strange Behaviour\\" as it has taken these songs and turned them inside out by remixing them into different versions, mostly so-called \\"night visions\\" Whatever you call them, you may find yourself liking that release too, but it all starts here.

0671027344|4.0|I read \\"The perks to being a wallflower\\" I thought it was a very good book, I enjoyed it very much. I think it had alot of good points. It was a very \\"real\\" book showing what life is like for a lot of teenagers. It talks aboout all kinds things from death, suicide to girlfriends and sex. I think it also helped alot of kids realize that they'er not the only ones who feel like charlie (the main charcater)did. It is a very good book for a wide range of different people I would recomend it to anyone.

0743243307|4.0|Monica Ali's &quot;Brick Lane&quot; is an excellent debut novel that captures the struggles, the cultural clash, and the frustrations of a family caught between two worlds.<br />From the day of her birth, Nazneen is reminded how she is a puppet of fate. She dutifully leaves her small Bangladeshi village and goes to live in Brick Lane, the Bengali enclave of London, after her arranged marriage to Chanu, an educated but pompous and ineffectual man twice her age. She acts as a traditional, dutiful, and useful wife. After accepting whatever cards fate deals her, however, she casts a critical eye at the actions of her friends, her sister and her mother. She questions whether she can actually control her life. She starts to break free, first with small subtle acts of rebellion and then an affair. Finally, with the interests of her children in mind, she takes a giant step toward becoming her own woman. Interspersed throughout the story line are letters to Nazneen from her sister Hasina, who strikes out on her own in Bangladesh and, through good times and bad, forges a life of her own.<br />The writing style is colorful and descriptive. The reader can smell the spices wafting through the hallways, view the multicultural clutter of a shabby and overcrowded apartment, and share the confusion and outrage that simmer in Brick Lane due to cultural, religious, and racial prejudice. Each character is carefully crafted and brought to life. Ali peels back the surface layers of Chanu to reveal his inner doubts and disallusionment. The secondary characters such as the starchy Dr. Azad, the crafty hypochondriac Mrs. Islam, and the Britishized Razia, are depicted with a deft touch. There are only two points in the novel that could be improved upon. First, although the absent Hasina's letters add another dimension to the story by developing her personality and experiences, at one point they lead the reader off on a several year tangent that leaves a gap in Nazneen's time-line. Second, there are many ethnic words for food and clothing that are not explained, and these might cause the reader some confusion. Overall, however, this book is a seamless blend of the Old Country and the New, and it brings new insights to the immigrant experience.here are many ethnic words for food and clothing that are not explained, and these might cause the reader some confusion.

B0000DD7NL|3.0|Don't get me wrong I do like Alicia Keys and I usually like her music but I really didnt admire this cd. All the songs were so mellow for me that it put me to sleep.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|I absolutely love Mariah Carey's &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You.&quot;  I cannot stand how Mariah Carey sings.  (I must however give her credit for cowriting a spunky, fun and very catchy tune.)  But oh that Olivia Olson can sing.  And she is wonderful with this song.  To me this is the best of both worlds.<BR>As for the rest of the cd: I think it's great.  While I can do without some of the generic pop songs in general (like those from Kelly Clarkson, Dido, The Calling) the songs on the cd bring me back to the scenes of the movie (wonderful movie) and make me smile.  I love Eva Cassidy's rendition of &quot;Song Bird.&quot;  It's such a beautiful and romantic song, sung with equal beauty.<BR>If you love the movie, the cd will remind you of the joy that the movie brings.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I firmly believe the press and fans gave Madonna too much grief over American Life.  I have always been a loyal subject of Madonna's for those 20 terrific years.  Trust me, I have not loved everything she did (but most), but I've always ventured with her on her journey.  Madonna is the one performer that I can honestly say introduces me to new musical genre's that I normally wouldn't listen to.  I like Britney's In the Zone because of the Madonna collaboration first off, but grew to really like her CD.  I can do without R&amp;B, but I loved Bedtime Stories.  Madonna's main problem (and what a problem to have!) is that she has to top herself and that's quite a feat....even for her sometimes.  She's human too.  Madonna doesn't deserve the nastiness of most reviews calling her old and washed up.  Let's see you at 46!  We should all look that great.  American Life deserves a second or 3rd listen...it's way worth it.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until I saw it and I thought it was great.  The action sequences aren't cheesy like most movies, they're very nicely coreographed and executed; everything is just so precise.  They also didn't resort to the cheesy bullet time stuff that the Matrix uses so much (while the nifty graphics in the Matrix are cool, the fact that they're almost all CG takes away from their value).  If you like 1984/Brave New World and a Matrix-type story line without the religious innuendo, this is a great movie for you.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I bought the CD right after I watched the movie.... I knew this was going to be a CD without a dought! I recommend it to everyone!!!! It's just hard to believe that no one would not like this kind of touching music..... Its the kind of music that moves the soul! really reaches out and grabs you! A must have as well as the movie!!!!! Unforgettable! Remarkable!! Astonishing! CD!!!! I am deffinitly a huge Zimmer Fan!!!!! For I cant wait to see what he has planned for his next album!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|this was a show that never had a chance.  It was a nice blend of sci-fi and western with interesting characters that we sadly didnt get to know more about. when it first aired on tv it was aired out of order which confused alot of people. when i originally saw it on tv i was unimpressed but i gave it a chance on dvd because i think joss wheadon is awsome and watching it in order i gotta say i loved it. it is defintely worth the money. and if your still not sure just give it a chance and when your watching admire the work that must of went in to creating that future. you might be surprised with how good it is.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|In January of 1969, The Beatles gathered at Twickenham Studios to film what would become the full-length movie feature, &quot;Let it Be.&quot;  The original idea behind the recording of the companion tracks at Apple Studio was that the resulting album would consist of the band's music in its simplest form, i.e., free of special effects, additional vocal dubs, studio wizardry, or sweetening.  The original plan was for the songs to be unadorned, as they would be if performed live on stage.<br />Unfortunately, the group was in the throes of dissention, and &quot;Let it Be&quot; turned out to be less a documentary of musical artistry than that of the breakup of a legendary band.  The studio tracks languished for more than a year, until producer Phil Spector was brought in to get them released on vinyl once and for all.  In true Spector fashion, the tracks were enhanced with church-choir backing vocals and full orchestral arrangements, the antithesis of the original concept behind the album.  Three hit singles were spawned from the &quot;Let it Be&quot; sessions: &quot;Get Back,&quot; &quot;Let it Be,&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; b/w &quot;For You Blue.&quot;<br />In 2003, the surviving Beatles, Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, with permission from the estates of John Lennon and George Harrison, returned to the studio to strip the &quot;Let it Be&quot; tracks of the studio effects, essentially restoring them to their intended state.  Two tracks from the original 1970 release, &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae,&quot; have been eliminated; one track, &quot;Don't Let Me Down,&quot; has been added, and the result is a stunningly crisp and clear recording, taking full advantage of the technology that did not exist 30+ years ago.  &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; 2003 is a different take from that used on the 1970 album, and it's startling to hear Paul's plaintive vocals sans the dramatic strings that were the trademark of the original recording.  Although it's different and pleasing to the ear, my personal taste favors the 1970 version.  However, the title track sounds magnificent, as do the remaining nine.  The clarity is unbelievable; it's like being in the room with the guys.<br />A bonus disc, &quot;Fly on the Wall,&quot; is included with the &quot;Let it Be ... Naked&quot; CD.  This disc consists of inside chatter and a few snippets from songs not on the album.<br />&quot;Let it Be ... Naked&quot; is a must-have for all Beatles fans.g.

Although it has some good information about what specific muscles jobs are, the illustrations are not clear enough for good understanding. As an artist specifically working with the human form I find this book very mickey mousey and incomplete. If you already have all the books ever created on human anatomy that are needed to put together the information that is required to have a comprehensive knowledge on how the human body is constructed and moves then get this to finish your collection, but if you are looking for a clear understanding and accurate information on human anatomy for the artist look elswhere.

0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code was phenomenal!  There is nothing not to like!  The perfect blend of suspense, action, history, conspiracy and theology, The Da Vinci Code has it all.  Once you have read the first paragraph of The Da Vinci Code, you will not be able to put it down.  The Da Vinci Code is not just any mystery book, but is the mystery book.  Dan Brown goes where few will, and challenges the church with unbelievable research.  Brown is the king of enigma.  The more I read, the more I had to read.<br /> When the elderly Jacques Sauni&egrave;re (curator at Le Louvre) is murdered he leaves behind a number of anagrams, puzzles and codes.  Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist, and Sophie Nuevue, a cryptologist and the granddaughter of Jacques Sauni&egrave;re, are paired together to solve the crime.  The two go from fugitives to heroes as they go on an action packed quest for the Holy Grail.<br /> The Da Vinci Code is a great read for anyone who is into suspense, or anyone who isn't.  I would recommend this book for anyone who is up for the long nights of \\"just one more chapter\\".  If there were any flaws in this book, I failed to see them because I was too busy reading.  I give The Da Vinci Code a ten out of ten!

B000068PQ0|1.0|I'm sure my music review will get slammed by many readers but i think the truth needs to be told.  The Flaming Lips is evidence why music has been sucking for the last five years or so...\\"In the good old days\\" there was competition among Beck, Pavement, Fugazi, Sonic Youth, Nirvana just to name a few cool bands...in short musicians with an original idea and inspiration!!!  Now, the music has gone totally pussy, twee, and uncreative with the Flaming Lips leading way.  The Flaming Lips are the most gimmicky indie band on the planet.  Most of their riffs and sound alterations are for no purpose except to sound \\"sort of cool\\" to people who don't have an ear for cool music.  There's no inspiration behind these songs...honestly, the Flaming Lips appeals to people who haven't got over their children's music phase.  For christ sakes,  even \\"Raffi\\" is more sincere than these prostitutes of the music industry.  The music scene will be a whole lot better off when these losers die.  While everthing of they do sounds really bad, the ultimate worst was their cover of Kylie Minogue's \\"Can't Get You Outta My Head.\\"  They transformed a sexy song into a bonfire sing along for a Christian youth group.
B0000CAQ27|1.0|P!NK changes her persona as much as she changes her genre of music. Her debut album &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot; is an r&amp;b wonder. Her second &quot;Mizzundastood&quot; had a more pop-rock sound. This third disc &quot;Try This&quot; is plain ol' rock. She trys to be so-called punk-rock but fails ultimately.<br />Not only that but her new look is as worst as this new album. Boring, sappy, songs that doesn't stay in anyone's attention span for more than a minute. &quot;I am trouble yo', I am trouble now...&quot; right, the only thing that is troubling is your fake image. Trailer park trash Avril Lavigne can pull off the whole fake image thing. But Ms. Alicia Moore you can't. Don't try this, try something else!
B00005JLR6|5.0|Reeling from a family tragedy, Irish immigrant Johnny (Paddy Considine); his wife, Sarah (Samantha Morton); and their two imaginative young daughters look to start over in the United States. Full of hope, they move into a rundown tenement in the roughest part of Manhattan. They're there to live the American dream, but early on, the Big Apple proves to be a sour experience. Their place is a dump, good jobs are difficult to find, and dangers lurk everywhere. Despite everything, the girls find New York a nice escape from their past lives and think there's magic in Manhattan. <br />IN AMERICA is so much more than the typical immigrant story. Rather, this film portrays realistic and heartfelt emotions of grief and bewilderment, sorrow and happiness. I was completely captivated by this family's struggles and couldn't help being drawn into their personal dilemmas. This is a delightful film worthy of praise and admiration.
B00006ALGL|4.0|I purchased this cd in July of 2002 in Ireland.  The first few tracks are amazing, it ends well with Eskimo as well. There are about 2 tracks that are weak, but overall the cd is outstanding.  Definitely not worth $42 if you import, but worth buying.
630289915X|5.0|\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is often thought of as a Christmas movie -perhaps because it has become a tradition to show the movie on television every year in December. Only a very small part of the story takes place during the Christmas season, though, and that's at the film's conclusion. \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is most likely considered a Christmas film because it embodies the \\"Christmas spirit\\". No other movie has championed the spirit of giving and sacrificing one's own desires for the good of others so successfully as this film.<br /><br />\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" stars Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, a bright ambitious man who is also considerate and generous to a fault. He is so considerate and generous that he has always sacrificed his own happiness and goals so that others might pursue theirs. When bad luck strikes a final blow, it seems like all of his generosity has brought George nothing but dissatisfaction and a bad end. An angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) is sent to Earth to convince George that he has had a wonderful life, after all, and one that is very much worth living.<br /><br />\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"'s message is more idealistic than realistic. And I'm not sure that advocating constantly putting the happiness of others ahead of your own is at all wise. But this is a wonderfully entertaining and well-constructed film nonetheless. Jimmy Stewart is due much of the credit for the film's success. This is one of his finest performances. Perpetual self-sacrifice could easily grow tedious, and George Bailey would be a  saccharine character in the hands of a lesser actor. But with the help of a terrific script, Stewart makes George sympathetic and interesting. The supporting cast does a fine job. The cinematography and art direction are excellent. \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is simply a pleasure to watch, which is why it has become a Christmas classic. Recommended for viewing on cold winter nights. Somehow that works best. It will make a Jimmy Stewart fan out of you.
0451191153|5.0|the best book i've ever read...i found the end a bit disppointing.a friend of mine had recommended the book to me.it is surely a masterpiece.the character of dominique and roark was very impressive well described.roark the hero of the novel..somebody who's just in love with his work and the emotions and relationships are not importand for him,he is not artificial and fake.he is how a man should be..he stuck to his principles all through his life.i think everybody must read this book.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|For Britney Spears, the past few years were really rough. She faced so many problems in her personal love, to her parents seperating. But when it comes to her music and her image, it simply is just terrible. The music has been all just the same time and time again, without anything different. I think it is just a shame, she is becoming more like our current Milli Vanilli, Jennifer Lopez. Arguably, I think she'd better grow up soon, because the world may pass her by.<br />In The Zone, her latest record is really very trashy. The songs sound exactly alike from her previous records, Britney, Oops... I Did It Again, and Baby One More Time. There really is nothing new, but also a lot of trashy new music, with songs like Breathe On Me, Toxic, Showdown, and Shadow. The songs can't seem to break into a whole different category. But what really sinks to an all time low, for the Madonna sing-a-like, is that she does a awful duet with her, on Me Against The Music. It really is one of the worst moves Britney Spears has done, and proves that she has to stop herself from overexposing the zone.<br />As for Britney, she really needs to try to change her zone right away, because she hasn't been able to do it yet. I would suggest you get Alicia Keys new record on the shelves. The Diary Of Alicia Keys is a much better record than this one anyway. Britney, oops... not even this time.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have all of Dream Theater CDs and have listen to them for a long time now. I listened to this CD several times in my normal cd-tower and i thought this one really isnt up to par. So for some time i didnt listen to it at all. One night i decided to give it another try, and i lay down in my bed, put on the headphones and listened to it that way. The POWER, the feeling, the emotion - everything was suddenly clear to me. This is a masterpiece. Harder than any other DT album but pure DT none the less. I recommend not to listen to this as a background, but really LISTEN to it
B000069AUI|5.0|Superb album! A worthy successor to Parachutes. Few tracks need a bit of listening to grow on to you, but overall, each song is a masterpiece... <br />Another suggestion - try the DVD (Live 2003)together with this album (or Parachutes) - you can see a bunch of musicians having a blast on stage - really helps you appreciate the music and the musicians much more...<br />Way to go guys! Can't wait for the next album!!
B0000TB05A|4.0|this is simply a fantastic live spectacle from one of the great bands of rock.  there is an absolute and undeniable exchange of energy between the band and this audience, it's hard to tell who's enjoying themselves more; the band or the fans.  because of it the show is real joy to watch and listen to.  i'm by no means an authority on U2 shows or the band for that matter, i just love great rock-n-roll whatever flavor it comes in, but the set list here and the spirit and alacrity that they give the performance is just stellar.  if all U2 shows are this fun, i'm definately going to catch the next tour.  the unforgettable fire documentary on the disc is also enjoyable in that it shows the band before they got to be super rock stars with all of the money and beauty that comes with it.  they're just 4 rock dorks living for the sake of the song, the sound and the moment, which of course, is where all great art is generated.
0930289234|1.0|Okay, first of all, I'm not a huge fan of superhero comics. I do however like comics that have a certain depth to it, so when I read al the praizing i became interested. This one was supposed to be different. It supposed to be more than just a comic, more than just a bunch of superheroes.<br />It starts of okay, but pretty soon I had to admit i wasn't all that impressed. Actually, I found it all a bit tedious. The wrtinig became less and less impressive, the story less and less challanging and by the time I was at the middle of the book, I was totally bored.<br />There are people around who insist on comparing this stuff to great works of literature. I wonder if they ever read any.
B00006LWSF|4.0|What's up every1? I listened to this CD da 2nd day it came out and i was very impressed. there weren't many songs 4rom eminem but da songs were there, were real good. Some tracks I like r following:<br /> 'LOSE YOURSELF' is a good opening track. eminem tried real hard &amp; he made it. Can't skip this song.<BR> <BR>'LOVE ME' is another great song with obie trice, 50 cent, and eminem. Obie Trice's voice kinda cracking down in this song. worth listening.<br />'8 MILE' Damn! Eminem's greatest song of all times. specially the lyrics. man, a MUST listen song.<br />'RAP GAME' Kind of weak but good funny lyrics.<br />'U WANNA BE ME' Cool beat, lyrics and vocals by NAS. He is a king of rap for me.Can't skip this one either.<br />'WANSKTA' 50 cent won't disspoint u in this 1. gangsta rap like always.<br />'BATTLE' from GANSTARR. my 1st time listening to him and my favourite song from dis album.<br />'RABBIT RUN' REminding of the 8mile movie. good one from em.<br />Overall most of the tracks r good. BUY THIS!!!!!!!!
B000001DV2|4.0|I think this is a good progression for Def Leppard. I own Pyromania, Hysteria, The Vault, X, and I think this album is Def Leppard changing with the times. It has a clean sound and, as always, amazing vocals and instrumental. Over all, not a bad listen. <br />You can't sell 80's music in the 90's....
B0000AQVCL|5.0|The Only way to describe this band is...Simple but powerful rock.    The Beatles meets Blackcrowes. They can be supercharged, with a quick up beat, yet slow-and-hipnotic. They are defining what will become this centuries blues, a whole new genre, that I decribe as Synthesized Blues. This band plays well and the lead singer can can scream and sing low and high. Get this cd if you're looking to hear some music that straight up makes you want to dance, but has songs that are mellow and peacful. These guys are going to be big-not just another &quot;one hit wonder.&quot;<BR>and I hope they tour soon.
B0000CD5I6|4.0|This is an extremely eloquent and satisfying work from Ian, Martin &amp; Co. The best of it's genre out there. However, Tull music is hard to catagorize or pigeonhole due to it's eclectic nature. It is, for all intents and purposes, put in the prog-rock catagory, which is fine, but they are far more than that. Ian Anderson is a master songwriter, and they are all masters of the many and varied instruments they play. As is stated on the package, if you liked Thick As A Brick, Songs From The Wood, and Heavy Horses, you will love this album. It's a nice mix of jazz, classical, rock, &amp; folk elements, and captures the feel of the season unlike any Christmas record out there, past &amp; present. I recommend this record to fans and non-fans alike. It will be a welcome addition to any holiday collection. If your're a fan of the flute, and rock flute in particular, I don't think you'll be dissapointed. Ian is an uniquely gifted flute player, truly one-of-a-kind!
0920668372|1.0|I agree with most of the other 1 star reviews. The topic is depressing and way too heavy for small children. Who wants to talk about death and ageing at bedtime? This seems like a tough way to get to unconditional love.  My sister gave this to my son so I cannot throw it away as I don't want to offend her. My wife also hates it. <br />In addition to the above the book is poorly executed. The drawings are crude and the text is clumsily written. <br />I think this book could be used in some sort of personality profile. It is fun to ask other parents what they think of this book.
B0000AGQ26|1.0|For those who think that drunkenness, lewdness, and boorishness are the hallmarks of humor, this one is a classic.  However, for the civilized, this is a steaming heap of trash, and nothing more.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I am really glad that I bought this dvd set.  I am also glad that Amazon sold it for $30 less than the retail stores. It is loaded with interviews by the creaters of the films and gives Alien fans insight into the creative process.<br />The best part of the set is Alien 3 special edition--I was not disappointed. Fans have been anticipating this release for a long time. Seeing the special edition enhances the characters and completes the tale the the director David Fincher tried to tell.  It is a  shame that the &quot;suits&quot; at Fox got scared and butchered his original vision.<br />I highly recommend this boxed set to any Alien movie or science fiction fan.
B00005JMTQ|2.0|Diane Keaton (Erica) in the half-baked\\" (as The New York Metero defined this film and I concur) \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" was a disappointment. Keaton once again played the career driven, successful divorcee wearing the same up tight clothing moving dangerously from turtlenecks to a modest V neck style change of wardrobe. I guess this was to portray a 1950's...2003 version of \\"keep one foot on the floor\\"  love scene. <br />     The infamous wailing scene in which Erica feels she has opened her heart to Jack knowing he has never committed to a single woman in his entire life (she must of thought she could change him even after knowing he was a playboy who had been panting after her 20 something year old daughter) flounders around on her bed feeling rejected ..why because Jack didn't say he loved her after knowing her for a full week and jumping into the sack for one entire night?  This sobbing scene; however, channels Erica's emotions into the completion (ah bitter sweet) of her up and coming, taken for granted, successful screenplay.. this scene had to be an embarrassment to women everywhere to watch. Keaton can certainly wail and if they gave an award for wailing, she definitely would win hands down.<br />     The love scenes were lacking in emotion even between Erica's young 30 something doctor played by Keanu Reeves. Amander Peet (Erica's daughter, Marin) easily passes old Jack over to her mother..I guess all the heart palpitations coupled with Jack's need for Viagra scared her into the reality he was older than her father.. who incidentally graces us with a short kitchen scene in his turned up collar polo shirt (who dresses like that anymore..oops forgot was taking place on Cape 'Teddy Kennedy') Her father then takes a wife of 20 something after 3 weeks of really getting to know her and meeting her in Erica's kitchen aka Jack's assistant...am I boring you yet? As I said, just another older guy..younger woman..younger man older woman..older man younger woman. Somehow Nicholson was able to carry this film off enough so you didn't start counting the neck hairs on the guy sitting in front of you... with his built in devilish smiles and his pretty sharp designer linen shirts. The New England styled house, architecturally, was great, however. Ah...as you see, I became bored with the story and pretended I was touring through some Hollywood Celebs' beach front digs. <br />Sorry, there was no 'spark' after over an hour of watching  2 sticks (Jack and Erica) rub together!
B000060P79|1.0|Ok, first of all, simple plan used to be a decent band.  They used to be a band called Reset and were on a undergroung label in canada.  While they were reset they actually were ok.  They were much more technical, had decent non-recycled lyrics, and played more than three power chords.  They decided to &quot;sell out&quot;.  They &quot;sold out&quot; because they decided to change there music style to favor the mass of people that enjoy recycled, major lable, poppy, easy to listen to music that has destroyed music these days.  Music for people that know nothing about musci and listed to music because dont take time or effort to look for great bands that are not fed to you by radio and mtv.  This is why simple plan sucks, along with good charlotte. (rant off)
B00008GKEG|5.0|The Beatles Anthology is a must-have for all Beatles fans! Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr contributed a lot of their time to give their fans a comprehensive view of their lives as The Beatles. John Lennon is very much alive in this documentry. John's perspective is presented in many interviews. The Anthology covers their childhoods, the Hamburg days, early triumphs, Beatlemania, concert tours, and many other milestones. If you're a long-time fan or a new fan, I highly recommend you watch the Anthology dvd. The book of the same name is also good.
B0000UMD00|4.0|As soon as I heard Pink was coming out with a new CD I was soo excited. I loves Mizundaztood and it is better than Try this. But still. I liked some songs more than others but overall I like the whole CD
B00005ASHM|3.0|Oh well it is #2 on the Rolling Stone 500. I guess they had to push for an American album to compete with all the great Beatles albums. When it comes to rock N roll America is a small fry compared to Britain. Now I know all you  Americans are huffing and puffing with guns in hand, but you have to realize great music comes from places with great culture.  As for this album the All American Beach Boys hit the surf and come up with this suprisingly good album. For an album that only reached #10 on Billboard and sold over 1 million, it has good artistic merit, but thats as far as my praise will go.  The 2nd song \\"You Still Believe in Me\\" is by far the best and only song that has real emotional feel. The rest of the album is crew cut style empty pop, trust me folks I really tried to give this album a fair chance, especially with all the Rolling Stone fanfare. Rolling Stone surveyed mostly American men in their middle ages, so the list is biased to a degree. This is not a bad album , but to compare it with anything the Beatles did is an insult.
B000002KD9|5.0|I bought this album a while back but never really listened to it until recently.  I have been listening to it nonstop for the past couple of weeks.  The harmonizing on Tell Me Why is absolutely amazing.  Every song is great and they flow together perfectly.  Definitely an album that needs to be listened to straight through.  Cripple Creek Ferry is an excellent ending to this already great album.
B000002H2H|5.0|master of puppets, while I'll admit is sort of better, this album is still perfection, and in many ways better than MoP/ Give RTL a chance.<br />(a big reason i wrote this was to get that total joke review about st anger off the main page)
0807126063|3.0|According to the Forward, by Walker Percy, this young author suicided in 1969.  By doing so he missed seeing so many of his perceptions of humanity and social conditions in the US carried to their ultimate logical extreme.  Toole was obviously an observant young writer, able to voice opinion well without communicating the underlying bitterness one would expect of a person on the brink of self-homicide.<br />Perhaps Toole intended the characters to be caricatures.  If so, he failed.  The characters are merely the (not particularly) extremes found in the population pool of the 20th Century US, created and presented to the reader within a plot probably believed to be humorous.  Readers might find the humor an uncomfortably realistic portrayal of human flaws.<br />The book is certainly well written.  It's an interesting read with excellent characterization, plot, and setting.  It's also a book I didn't enjoy reading.  Toole's astute awareness of human motivation, stupidity and the direction society was headed was, for me, overshadowed by the fact of his suicide.  <br />Toole guessed right about the direction and perceived correctly about many facets of the human condition, then deliberately curtailed his own experience of that life.  Reading the book without that knowledge would have made it enjoyable and had me laughing through every page.
B00002Z88D|5.0|S&amp;M is a truly unique album, combining metallica and the symphony orchestra. It should be recognized even more after the reent death of micheal kamen.. it is a true unique masterpiece.<br />1. Ecstasy of Gold   -A symphony song, serves as a good intro. You probably wont pay much attention to it, but its actually pretty cool. 9/10<BR>2. Call of Ktulu  - uhh.. intro part 2? An instrumental from an earlier metallica album that was already conpleted, and brought to perfection here. 9.5/10<BR>3. Master of Puppets - At last, the cd 'starts'. I see no better way to start things off than their masterpiece song.. 10/10  <BR>4. Of Wolf and Man  - Surprisingly good.. the orchestra really adds something to this song.. 9/10<BR>5. Thing That Should Not Be  - The orchestra adds impact instrumentally but where the hell did the second verse go? I see no logical explanation and he didnt just 'forget' ... 8/10<BR>6. Fuel - Not that I liked this song to begin with, its better here. 8.5/10         <BR>7. Memory Remains - as i expected, this song is much better on S&amp;M. Seems different, much better. 8.5/10         <BR>8. No Leaf Clover - new, unreleased song, rather well done, too.. good volume changes and pretty cool metaphorical chorus. 9.5/10       <BR>9. Hero of the Day - mediocore poppy song.. why is it on here? 8/10          <BR>10. Devil's Dance - wow, the orchestra really adds a lot here.. just the first few seconds rock.. 10/10         <BR>11. Bleeding Me - I dont think it was a good way to end the first disk, but its still well done. 9/10         <BR>Disc: 2 (waaaaay better than disk 1)<BR>    <BR>1. Nothing Else Matters - I dont like hetfield's vocals at first but things really pick up.. the total opposite beginning than disk 1.. awesome. 10/10         <BR>2. Until It Sleeps - this song really starts to grow on you, especially the chorus, particularily toward the end of the song. 10/10         <BR>3. For Whom the Bell Tolls - o.O wow. while its unfair to compare to compare this to the version on 'ride the lightning' this version rocks! Honestly, there was no better way to complete the almost 2 minute intro than adding the orchestra.. amazing. 10/10         <BR>4. Human  -same as no leaf clover, unreleased. The verses arent too good, but the chorus is quite catchy. 8/10        <BR>5. Wherever I May Roam  - theres got to be something i dont see in this song.. ive never liked it in the first place but i dont think its 'bad'. 8/10        <BR>6. Outlaw Torn - the longest song on the album, but truly amazing.. 10/10         <BR>7. Sad But True- the orchestra, predicably, adds a lot to this slow, heavy song. 10/10          <BR>8. One - like many songs, you'd expect this song to be enhanced. And it is, but by the band too. There are some extra lyrics randomly thrown into the solo at the end. 10/10         <BR>9. Enter Sandman - Very intrumental song, a lot of energy added to the live version. 10/10         <BR>10. Battery  - Noticing a trend in the last few songs? While master of puppets version was sort of faster and more energetic theres something to be said about the energy in this one (a 'hell yeah' or two really completed this song) 10/10
B000068IEU|1.0|Why oh why are people saying this film is &quot;fantastic&quot;.... why are you saying this movie is &quot;disturbing&quot;.  Oh poor mislead people....Only one word can sum up this nasty little piece of work, and that word is &quot;CRAP&quot;.  My video player is still vomiting reels of brown turd colored tape, theres no way I'll subject my DVD player to anything as bad as this.  And not bad in a thrilling &quot;Im so scared&quot; way, but bad in an &quot;Oh my god, I cant believe this was ever recognised as a structured film&quot; kind of way.  I simply dont understand how anybody involved in even the most amatuer of film making could have edited this and said &quot;oh yes, this is the final cut we will use&quot;.  I have seen better films from year 9 High School media projects.  You can watch this for a laugh at how bad it is, but, please people, I know everyones views are different, and everyone has their own opinion on what is &quot;artistically&quot; appealing to each and every person, but, this is not a horror movie, this is not art, this is just a bunch of unskilled idiots both behind and in front of the camera running around in someones over grown back yard making fools of themselves.  Forget it and I want a refund.... complete trash, utter rubbish.... a pile of steaming flie blown offal....as another reviewer stated previously.... I wish I could have the 82 minutes back that I wasted watching this poo !!

0783225857|3.0|The narrative is smooth and the screenplay keeps you on your edge. Peck's good. The setting has a charged undercurrent of racism, which I am sure must've been very poignant during the movie's release. Yes, it's a great movie, especially on the digitally mastered DVD.<br />But it is not the magnum opus that people never seem to get enough of raving about. Perhaps it just hasn't aged that well.<br />The story is set in Alabama during the Great Depression. It follows the life of Scout Finch, a little girl growing up in those wretched times. Basically, it's about what's going on with the town and what's going on with Scout and her family throughout her growth, leading to different storylines of events that happens to Scout and the rest of the Finch's.<br />Probably the only storyline I really appreciated was the story of Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus (Scout's father) was defending Tom in a rape case, and since Tom was black, this was taboo in Maycomb. This pithily showed unfairness and how cruel prejudice and hate can be. Maybe if the movie was only centered around that story instead of throwing in aspects like Boo Radley, Dill, and others, I would consider calling this movie a classic. It didn't really help that Scout, who is supposed to be an innocent unknowing little girl, actually comes off as an annoying, loud, obnoxious brat that you'd want to slap throughout the entire movie.<br />There's some good acting  although Gregory Peck's wooden oh-so-conscientious face was nowhere near Oscar worthy, had it not been for the controversial theme. In the end, the courtroom scenes are perhaps the only engaging bit I would recommend this movie for.
B0000UHFC6|4.0|First of all, I am a devoted fan of Shore's work on the LOTR trilogy. I play these in my car all the time. I'm sure most of the people reading this can relate; so you might respond to this score the same way I did.<br />In my opinion, you can't really review a CD like this until you've listened to it 5 or 6 times. It's especially hard if you haven't seen the movie. When I first listened to this score, I actually thought it was quite boring! Now that I'm familiar with it, it's not as boring as I thought, but it still is a bit dull especially when compared to the Two Towers score. I would say it is my least favorite of the three.<br />The problem is that nothing really happens! It's hard to relate to it because most of the thematic material is gone (the Fellowship theme is under-represented, the Frodo/Sam theme appears a bit at the end, the Rohan theme appears one time quite weakly, and Saruman's is gone). We do hear the Gondor theme quite a bit, thankfully. But with so much missing, you need the track list to have any idea what's going on. <br />It does have its strong points. The best part is probably the Mount Doom section, which features a haunting solo by Ms. Fleming, sandwiched by explosive choral sections. The cameos by Pippin and Aragorn are great. And it's neat to hear some more Shire stuff at the end.<br />Annie Lennox's song is OK ... it's a nice tune, but I don't really care for her voice and the lyrics are just a bit fluffy. It's not as good as the other two vocal songs. The part after the credits is a huge letdown. It should have been triumphant, but there's just nothing memorable in it.<br />All three scores have been surprising and unique, and this one is no different. I'm sure it suits the movie perfectly, but taking the disc on its own merits, I just can't help but think it could have been better.<br />A note on the DVD: I really think New Line has dropped the ball here in that across all the DVDs they have released, they don't give Shore enough timeto explain why he wrote the music the way he did. This disc had huge potential for that, but all it really is is 25 minutes or so of behind the scenes. You'll get to see what it's like to compose and record music, but unfortunately we don't get inside Shore's head nearly enough. One final thing--the DVD shows a choir recording an powerful vocal version of the Fellowship theme. Why on earth isn't this on the CD?
B00005JMCW|4.0|The movie is a pleasant surprise! It's a remake of a 1976 movie of the same name with Jodie Foster (also by Disney), but is one of the few remakes that easily outdo the original. It is no milestone in filmaking, but in a season chock-full of action movie sequels, and minimal creative products from a panicked studio system that is going through another period of zero originality, this is a blast of a release!<br />Yes, the theme is a slightly 70s doozie: body switching. But don't let that fool you into skipping this (as it did me) because the direction is sharp, not heavy handed. No special effects, great writing, crisp dialogue, just a plain fun movie, like the studios cranked out for decades, before they became what they are today. Curtis as usual is simply charming, she IS every bit the mother/daughter, and Linsday Lohan has a great presence.<br />It's straight family entertainment and generally likely to tickle everyone's fancies. This one I will recommending even owning as a DVD, its lighthearted banter makes for easy repeat viewing for pretty much the entire family.
B0000089FS|5.0|In 1986,Elton John returned to the MCA label after spending the previous six years with Geffen and recorded LIVE IN AUSTRALIA. This is the first studio album since returning to MCA. I DON'T WANNA GO ON WITH YOU LIKE THAT was on hit parade in the summer of 1988,when this album was released. The only other hit was A WORD IN SPANISH,a beautiful ballad with of course,Spanish style music. SINCE GOD INVENTED GIRLS has the Beach Boys,or at least some of them,singing background vocals. Elton even mentioned the popular surf music group in GOODBYE MARLON BRANDO. The front cover features memorabilia from Elton's past(the hats,glasses and wardrobes he wore). There even is a photo of little Reggie(pre-Elton John). Great album!
B00005JMCN|5.0|The movie seems to have its share of nay-sayers (no pun intended) and yes, there here may have been a few liberties with the facts from the book but nothing is sacrificed for Hollywoodesque drama: this is a fascinating rendition of a gripping book.<br />Wrongful expectations are placed on stunning movies like this by the overworked hoopla machine. Oprah for instance praised it because of how it \\"reinforces the American national pride.\\" Hmm.<br />My suggestion: see the movie for what it is. Tobey Maguire truly shines in this film. The real star is not even a human being.  The story (and it's a true one!) is uplifting without getting preachy. It's about achievement in the time of adversity. Funny and sad at the same time.  The racing sequences are brilliant. The movie ends where it ought to end, leaving the viewer with a sense of departing nostalgia.<br />Every proud movie buff needs to add this gem to his collections.

B00005JMTQ|3.0|The stars are great in this movie, and its them that deserves all credit for this movie!  Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson are wonderful, and so natural and likeable.  Too bad they are in a Nancy Meyers movie that drags on and on and on and on and on.  You know how it will end hours before it does!  And yet it rambles on for over two hours!  Reminds me of another Nancy Meyers film WHAT WOMEN WANT.  She needs an editor to keep the pace going!  Every guy in the theatre ran to the bathroom once the credits started!  I believe the women were just as desperate to get there!  Please please hire somebody to edit your next movie!!!!

B0000DZEA1|4.0|In this Soundtrack (and in both previous) lacked a great singer.  For me, the better artist for this type of music, epic and celtic: the canadian Loreena McKennitt.<br />There are not excuses for a great absence like this.<br />My congratulations for Annie Lenox.  In spite of McKennit, Annie continues being one of my favorite singer. And here she demonstrated it once again.
B000065U1N|5.0|Most reviews here talk about this battle being a disaster.  This was one of the most lopsided victories in military history.  The only disaster was a coward pretending to be president, who after the military completely destroyed Ahdids army, handed the country over to a piss ant warlord.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was one of those rare TV shows whose early demise made me genuinely sad. I don't know how many other &quot;failed&quot; series have grown in stature and popularity after cancellation, but this DVD release is sure to make Firefly one of them.<br />This treasure-trove contains the entire series in its correct order--far more logical and engaging than the order in which the network mindlessly aired it--including three episodes never broadcast during the Fox TV run in the U.S. In addition, all episodes are shown in wide-screen as the producers originally intended. The sound is crystal-clear. Cast-and-creators commentaries (available on about half of the episodes) are enjoyable and informative. AND there's an extras feature with gags and bloopers.<br />With the minor exception of the slightly unattractive menus, everything about these DVDs is top-notch, as befits this outstanding series. For me it was like Christmas. Only three weeks early.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia ripped it up on this hot new CD. I'm loving the whole thing. It really takes you through a journey. Usually, I skip through songs on CDs, but this is awesome. &quot;Karma&quot;, &quot;Diary&quot;, &quot;Dragon Dayz&quot;, &quot;So Simple&quot; and &quot;Samsonite Man&quot; are blazing. Alicia really came through to let ya know she ain't going no where. Make sure you check this CD out. It's going to be a classic.
B000006MS3|5.0|Never For Ever was proving ground for Kate Bush's experimental weirdness.  Her 1982 followup, The Dreaming, taken after the aboriginal concept of a link to God or heaven, takes that direction to the core and is Kate's most innovative and weirdest (in a great sense) album ever.  Weird vocal stylings, clever instrumentation and lyrics characterize this album.  The engaging single \\"Sat In Your Lap\\" is about someone who's too lazy to work, favoring the ivory tower of the intellectual, but has the misconception that \\"knowledge something that is sat in your lap.\\"  In the end, she sings \\"I hold a cup of wisdom, But there is nothing within. My cup, she never overfloweth, And 'tis I that moan- and groaneth.\\"<br />\\"There Goes A Tenner\\" is about a heist that goes awry, with Kate affecting a slight cockney accent in parts and featuring a music hall-like piano.  Throughout there are some male vocal interjections, such as the police and that classic line \\"What's all this, then?\\"  Funniest lyric: \\"I hope you remember/To treat the gelignite tenderly for me.\\"<br />\\"Pull Out The Pin\\" seems to be about a Vietnamese lying in ambush for an American soldier, ready to pull out the pin and toss the grenade at him.  In the chorus, Kate's voice rises to a frenzied pitch when she sings \\"I love life.\\"  The sobriety of the song is underlined:  \\"Just one thing in it/me or him.\\"<br />I don't know what the heck gaffa is, as in \\"Suspended In Gaffa\\" and its skipping music-hall piano and a quick one-two-three string waltz, but the girl in there is clearly a timid soul, scared of change, unwilling to be a Pandora.<br />Kate \\"lets the weirdness in\\" in \\"Leave It Open.\\"  Her vocals are in many styles, distorted lower register, echoing high-pitched girlish, stretched tape vocals, and wailing.  As for the weirdness, the male refrain keeps repeating, \\"Harm in us, but the power to arm.\\"<br />The droning weird title track is about life in the bush, no, not Kate, but in the Australian desert, where the habits of white man play havoc with nature, be it hitting kangaroos in the land rover or exploiting aborigine land for mineral wealth.  \\"The civilised keep alive/The territorial war./See the light ram through the gaps in the land./Erase the race that claim the place/And say we dig for ore, Or dangle devils in a bottle/And push them from the pull of the bush\\" demonstrates that \\"civilizing mission\\"<br />\\"Night of the Swallow\\" is about helping an escaped criminal by a hired plane, the swallow representing freedom.  There's some Uileann pipes that give this a Celtic tinge during the refrain.<br />The lonely, one-sided, and reincarnated soul in \\"All The Love\\" wants people to love her, but is oblivious to the other people, represented by a young boy singing \\"We needed you to love us too. We wait for your move.\\"  Also present is the observation that dying brings out the grief and love and how she's turned on by the attention.  The sighs and multiple phone message machines at the end is an interesting touch.<br />The soft piano ballad \\"Houdini\\" and some of the lyrics incorporate the album cover, where Houdini gets the key that'll unbind him from the water tank trick by kissing his assistant, who has the key in her mouth.  Her bellowing voice comes in here: \\"With your spit still on my lip, you hit the water\\" and there are moments when she wishes he'd drown.  When I heard the line \\"Rosabel believe\\" I thought it was \\"Roosevelt bleed\\" and I thought \\"What the...?\\"  There is a nice lyrical string section that plays after the bellowing bits.<br />\\"Get Out Of My House\\" is a really bizarre one, told from the point of view of a woman with a house analogy incorporated, telling a man to, well...  There are some erotic overtones \\"no stranger's feet will enter me/I wash the panes/I clean the stains\\" And in line with cleaning of the house, it seems to imply that men make a mess of her life, but there are multiple meanings, as the house also represents her neurotic mental psyche, as it's full ofher madness, mistakes, and fight.  She screams out the title, and even bellows like a mule (!!!) to demonstrate her stubbornness in not letting anyone in.<br />One of the weirdest but most wonderful from Kate Bush.  Even though she seemed to go mainstream in her followup, she continued the innovation of the Dreaming in the concept album portion.her madness, mistakes, and fight.  She screams out the title, and even bellows like a mule (!!!) to demonstrate her stubbornness in not letting anyone in.<br />One of the weirdest but most wonderful from Kate Bush.  Even though she seemed to go mainstream in her followup, she continued the innovation of the Dreaming in the concept album portion.
B00003CXIY|5.0|Like all of Ivan Reitman's films, &quot;Road Trip&quot; is a consistently funny- at times hilarious - story involving characters whom you come to care about in one way or another. Rather than creating cartoonish caricatures, Reitman creates somewhat real characters who find themselves in sometimes outlandish and far-fetched situations.<BR>&quot;Road Trip&quot; is one of those movies with an entertainment value that holds up well for a second or third viewing.
630289915X|5.0|This movie has it all...and it is a wonderful movie for those who thinks they wish they were never born or they think they are worthless in life. Everyone has a reason for being here on this earth, and this movie is a perfect example to show why.<BR>   George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) grew up in this American town, and did many things in his life that are very valuable to others (he saved his brother's life, he saved his father's banking company from a miser, he married his childhood sweetheart (played by Donna Reed), he saved his own boss from jail by refusing to give the poisioned pills to a customer, and more)...but George didn't realize that after he found out money was misplaced (really stolen by miser, Mr. Potter), and he was to go to jail. He tries to commit suicide but angel Clarence saves him, and showed him what life is like without George. George realized that the people he loves and likes don't recognize him (and his brother was dead because he wasn't there to save him), and wishes his life back, which it did happen after the cop asked him what's wrong. At the end, which really touched me, was the whole town comes in with money to help save George's banking company. The police decided not to arrest him, and it's a wonderful life for him again. Oh, and Clarence the angel finally got his wings!<BR>   I think it is a terrific movie and a good example for anyone to think about the next time you think you aren't worth anything to anyone in your life. I highly recommend this one...go see it!
B00008WT5M|4.0|There are three types of AC/DC songs: the killers, the rockers, and the B-sides. The Razors Edge has two killers: Thunderstruck and Fire Your Guns. If a &quot;Best of AC/DC&quot; album is made some day, both of these songs have to be on it. They are as good as anything on Back in Black.<br />There are seven rockers: Moneytalks, The Razors Edge, Rock Your Heart Out, Are You Ready, Shot of Love, Let's Make It, and If You Dare. Every one of these songs will make you nod your head up and down as you listen. They aren't as potent as the killers, but they're close enough.<br />The remaining three songs --- Mistress for Christmas, Got You By the Balls, Goodbye and Good Riddance to Bad Luck --- are B-sides. All three are pretty good (there's no bad song on this album), but none of them have a good enough guitar riff to measure up to the rest of the album.<br />This remastered disc sounds great. The drums and bass are as clear as the guitars, which is a nice change. (On too many rock albums, the bass is pushed way back until you can barely hear it.) The disc comes with a little full-color booklet that describes the circumstances under which the album was written and recorded. Overall, this is a great AC/DC album, far better than I expected. I bought it just to hear Thunderstruck over and over, but I like the whole thing. If you're into AC/DC, you'll love this.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This was always one of my favourite movies of all time. When I finally got my hands on my very own copy of &quot;The Bootleg Cut&quot; I was pleased and exited. I wasn't upset. The movie, although I didn't think it was posible, this version was even better. I was so very happy to see Anna Paquin's character in a few more scenes, because I didnt ever think her character was explored enough. Hate Hudson and Billy Crudup's relationship was also looked into a bit more. <br />What  can I say, I was just gagging for more, even though I had just had 30mins more...Anybody who loves this movie, get The Bootleg Cut...like now.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I finally got around to watching this and I'll have to say that it was worth the wait.  The movie is pretty hefty to watch in one sitting, as it is close to 4 hours long, but it doesn't seem like a 4 hour movie.  The added scenes seem to make the pace of the movie a little better and they definately fill in the holes that the Theatrical version had.<br />It is definately a middle piece in the tradition of Empire Strikes Back in that it ends on a somewhat up but down note.  Part of the bad guys vanquished, but there is still the task ahead.  Frodo seems to grow into his role as the ring bearer and Samwise is the support mechanism.  Not sure about the stuff with the Ents, but it was still pretty cool nonetheless.  The Elves coming to support Helms Deep was pretty cool because it was looking pretty grim at that point.  The battle scenes that followed were some of the coolest battle scenes put to celluoid.<br />Everything seems to be gearing up to the Return of the King and more stuff was added to this movie leaving no doubt who that would be.<br />As I said in my review of the other Rings movie, I wish more filmmakers would take lessons from Mr. Jackson.  He's raised the bar on fantasy movies in that it doesn't have to be bad.  He's also raised the bar on CGI characters in that they don't have to be annoying.  Gollum was just as real as any of the other characters.  This movie has raised the bar on other movies as well.<br />I haven't see the Return of the King movie, but since it is the conclusion of the series and if it is as good as the other two, it should win the Oscar for Best Picture.  In fact, the Oscar should be for the entire 9 hour effort because the whole triology is a movie in its own right.  With all the subpar stuff coming out of Hollywood, it is refreshing to see a good movie come out.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|When I listened to the previous DT album (6DOIT) I thought that 1st CD whas really awful, a stupid and fruitless replica of Metallica, however the 2nd CD made that album a decent album. This one, unfortunately, is simply an evolution (maybe a regression) of that 1st CD. Perhaps DT have definitely lost their melody.. However, if you like the previous (real) DT album, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!
6304711875|4.0|A HORROR MOVIE BUFF GOES ON A VIOLENT KILLING SPREE. YEAH, THIS MIGHT BE ANOTHER TEEN HORROR FLICK, BUT THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN THE OTHER HORROR MOVIES THAT CAME OUT IN RECENT YEARS. WES CRAVEN HAS CREATED ANOTHER GEM. THE ACTING IS PRETTY GOOD, THE MURDERS ARE COOL, AND IT EVEN HAS A GOOD ENDING. IT EVEN HAS CLEVER REFERENCES TO CLASSICS LIKE ''FRIDAY THE 13TH'', ''HALLOWEEN'', ''PSYCHO'', AND MANY OTHERS. A GOOD FUN TO WATCH IF YOU EVER NEED SOMETHING TO DO. FOLLOWED BY TWO SEQUELS.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Most of everyone has said this is great, so I had to purchase the DVD to see for myself... and saw it all in one sitting, which I have never done for any other show.  How could this show have been cancelled?!?  I want more of the series!  One reviewer compared this show to the crew of the Betty on Alien Resurrection.  You know, that's what I thought... but my thought was that it reminded me of the first crew from Alien.  And that's not a bad thing!  It's good, it's really good.  I would have liked to know more about the Alien crew except that wasn't the point of Alien (where the crew existed to get killed off).  Firefly also reminds me of the Miles Vorkosigan book series by Lois McMaster Bujold... Space Opera at it's finest.  Humor, clever, soap, lots of action. I want more Firefly!!!
B00006GEXQ|5.0|The film \\"About a boy\\" is a very amusing and interesting one.<BR>The story, based on the novel of Nick Hornby, deals with the twelve-year-old boy Marcus who seems to be too old for his age and the (for his 36 years) too superficial and unsensible Will Freeman. Slowly they get to know each other and (ex)change their characters.<BR>The both actors of these characters were a good choice. Hugh Grant, who plays Will, fits very well in his role, because he is young and seems to be easy-going. Marcus is presented very convincing, too. His mother Fiona is portrayed very funny and weird, like she should be. Unfortunately the character of the girl Ellie, a friend of Marcus, and her problems only play a much minor part than in the book. But more information about her would have blow up the contents of the movie. So the directors Chris and Paul Weitz have taken a good choice of the most important scenes, so that the main idea of Nick Hornby comes out clearly and the plot keeps exciting.<BR>All in all the story is presented realistic and in a funny way. The film is entertaining and I would recommend it to everyone!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This CD has the best flow from one song to another that I have ever hear. This is one of my favorite CD's thats sounds good everytime I hear it. The only song that I dont like is number 7 which is when the guy is just talking with a computer voice. The only way that you can understand it all is to pay real close attention or get some dro. This CD is incredible and by far the best radiohead, and I have them all.
B00005N7Z1|4.0|A COP [PETER WELLER] IS VIOLENTLY MURDERED BY A GANG OF CRIMINALS. SOON, A COMPANY NAMED OCP USES HIS FACE FOR A ROBOT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A PERFECT COP. BUT, PROBLEMS COME WHEN HE SEEKS VENGEANCE AGAINST THOSE WHO KILLED HIM AS A HUMAN. THIS EXTREMELY VIOLENT ACTION/SCI-FI MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST COP MOVIES EVER MADE. THE ACTING IS GOOD, THE ACTION IS GREAT, AND THE PLOT TWISTS ARE CLEVER. ANY ACTION FAN SHOULD LOVE THIS MOVIE. FOLLOWED BY TWO SEQUELS, AN ANIMATED TV SERIES, A LIVE-ACTION TV SERIES, AND FOUR DIRECT-TO-VIDEO MOVIES.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It simply does not get any better.  The beauty and revolutionary elements of this album cannot be beat.  Coming into the 90s rock music changed.  Rock music went to new levels of innovation--&quot;OK Computer&quot; is the peak of that and the peak of the 90s sound--this was as good as it got.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Yes, this album has some catchy club singles, but it's too risque for radio.  Britney seems to perform less and less with each CD.  Besides 'Everytime', which is not her best vocal work, Britney is constantly drowned by background vocals.  Some of these songs sound like the girl bands you hear on the Disney Channel, but with adult lyrics.<br />And on the topic of lyrics, if this is Britney's \\"coming of age\\" disc, then she's coming into being a tramp.  Even my 10 year daughter thinks Britney has become a cheap sell-out.  Since when does coming of age have to mean using sex to get a man or attracting attention?  Some women, and men, have more class than that.<br />Britney has the body, but Christina has the voice, and there's nothing either of them can do to change that.  Britney needed to focus on her vocal ability for this disc to prove that she's NOT just body, but instead chose to sell out and sell sex instead of talent.<br />It's over for Britney.
0679428895|4.0|What a great read.  Harris delivers a wonderful reading experience in Pompeii.  The story of young engineer Marcus Attilius is certainly plausible.<br />Young Attilius takes over responsibility of the Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct that delivers water to Pompeii and other cities in and around the Bay of Naples.  When the small city of Misenum stops receiving water via the aqueduct young Attilius convinces Pliny the Elder to let him investigate.  When Attilius arrives at Vesuvius he realizes that much more than water delivery is at stake.<br />Thrown against the background of history, Harris manages to spin a story of human interest that is at once captivating.  Against the history of the time Harris develops characters that are immediately believable and sheds light on a culture that is doomed both immediately and in the longterm.  His writing is economical which is refreshing.<br />A very intriguing story that is well researched.  You won't be sorry you read it.

6301792734|5.0|Unlike the new Star Wars movies (from the older stories)these original movies, before they were 'remastered', had true 'spirit' or 'heart' or whatever - they were REAL. The 'special effects' (damn good for that time, if u care) weren't what made the movies such awesome adventures.  It was a combination of things - a yearning to live the impeccable warrior life of a Jedi, to battle a terrible evil empire, to avenge the deaths of friends, family &amp; unknown innocents, to live in the beautiful forests of Endor with the strange, primitive creatures called 'Ewoks', to bravely enter into the unkown - if you do not understand, all I can say is what a pity. The pathetic attempts at humour found in the new movies were not in these original movies - they were not needed.<BR>When I was growing up, Star Wars, like Conan &amp; Monkey Magic (the real life series not the cartoon), inpires me. Lots.
0793518326|3.0|The book is really neat to have, but as a guitarist of 10 years, I just found too many mistakes to even take the book seriously. I just find it ridiculous that this can be published in this state. Regular folk and musicians alike have been admiring, worshipping, and studying all aspects of The Beatles for many years, yet a 20-year old casual musician like myself opens the book and finds laughable mistakes in just minutes. Good material to have, but purchase with caution, especially because of the hefty price tag.
067144901X|5.0|At age 9 mos. my little niece LOVED this book.  She would sit on our laps and listen and smile at each page.  She has plenty of books, but this is the one she chooses most often.
0385504209|4.0|If you like to read suspense and have a fondness for history this is a really good book. I loved this book.  I don't know if I've ever been able to give a book 5 stars (wish I could find one) but this is one of my favorites.  I only think the author dragged it on alittle to long at the end. But one of my fav's.  Read it!!!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This is the kind of soundtrack that you always hope will accompany any good movie, let alone a fantastic trilogy such as, The Lord of the Rings.  The movie The Return of the King, is due out on December 17th 2003.  If you're as big a fan as myself, and most poeple I know, you're just as much a collector.  This CD is no exception.  Listening to the music, you can follow Frodo to his Journeys end, and at the same time witness Aragorn become that which he is most destined to be.  The King.  This soundtrack is just as compelling a story as the actual writting by J.R.R. Tolkien.  What Tolkien did with words and parchment Howard Shore has managed to capture with exceptional quality and care.  Peter Jackson should be proud, and as well should Mr. Tolkien himself.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I saw it in the stores and bought it at first sight, after listenning to it, I felt I was &quot;stolen&quot;, it's by far, the weakest album from them, the tracks looks lost in a non-melodies songs (even their fist hit), should be the &quot;unispired&quot; moment every band suffer through, if you are a fan of DT, avoid this one or borrow from a friend, it is not worth to buy it, in my opinion, there are only 4 &quot;classic albuns&quot;: Images and Words, Awake, Falling Into Infinity and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (disc 2)....
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This debut album from Jet is one of the best debut albums I have ever bought. There is not a song that is bad; you won't want to skip any of the 13 tracks. The album starts off with some fast tracks, but then does a great job to slow it down for awhile with several slower songs, in which you can listen to their amazing vocals. These four Australians' captivating vocals, lyrics and music will have you listening to this wonderful album over and over again!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Back when I first saw Firefly, I caught a couple of episodes and dismissed it as fractured, unstructured and odd. A friend recently got the DVD and asked me to watch it. I did. And I discovered why I thought it was fractured, unstructured and odd: the air dates are all over the freakin' place. If I recall the order correctly, FOX actually showed the pilot episode LAST!<br />To let a series run one season, show the episodes all out of order, not air three episodes that are critical to the meta-plot...and then cancel the thing before it had a chance to shine; to not advertize the show at all (at least that I can recall); to simply let this gem get washed down the drain as it was -- I cannot imagine how anyone can see this as anything other than someone at FOX deliberately making all attempts to kill this show.<br />And I cannot imagine why. After watching all of them; watching them in order (and thus seeing how each episode builds on the previous ones in the series) I see that this is the television show that would have become my favorite had it been given half a chance to succeed.<br />FOX: wake up. You seriously messed up here. If you have any brains at all, once this movie comes out next year, you will renew the series and pick things up with season 2.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones' smoky, sometimes breathy voice and elegant style bring freshness and originality to the ballads she sings on this, her debut album. Her music is not quite jazz, so if you're looking for all-out jazz you might be disappointed with this CD. Jones most definitely does not swing! Her voice has a vulnerable quality that quietly gives new meaning to country-blues ballads about heartbreak, regret and loss. She can soar and carry her audience with her. She takes songs from various genres and stamps them with her own romantic, mellow sound. Her unique music does not need a genre label. A fine pianist Ms. Jones accompanies herself on all but one piece, but the major instrumental voice on this album is the acoustic guitar.<br />Norah's version of Hank Williams' &quot;Cold, Cold Heart,&quot; to my mind the highlight of the album, is wonderful and rings true with its emotional honesty. The J.D. Loudermilk song, &quot;Turn Me On,&quot; is a colorful country-jazz fusion while Hoagy Carmichael's &quot;The Nearness Of You&quot; calls up images of a smoky cocktail lounge with a top vocalist at the piano, filling the room with soulful sound. &quot;Feelin' the Same Way&quot; and &quot;Lonestar&quot; composed by Lee Alexander, have simple melodic lines and lyrics.&quot;Come Away With Me&quot; and &quot;Nightingale&quot; are Ms. Jones compositions and reflect her talent. &quot;I've Got To See You Again&quot; is another of my favorites.<br />If there is a flaw here it is an occasional lack of pizzaz. The music is almost too smooth and soothing at times, verging on monotonous. The &quot;almost monotony&quot; is relatively rare and does not stand in the way of enjoyment. Norah Jones' voice and the ballads she sings have a timeless quality. I look forward to following her most promising career.<br />JANA
B00005RIKI|5.0|This Great Band has Been called the &quot;Sounthern Version of Led Zeppelin&quot;<BR>I think this means that they were both Revolutionaries...<BR>Either way, I will compare this album to Led Zeppelin...<BR>First, They are both in Fact... Great<BR>If you like Led Zeppelin and/or like country, you will probably like this...<br />This album is alot like Zep's first in that it is alot of the same music... Zep's First was Bluesey... This is Rock with a Twang...<br />But it just sounds Right, and they hit the right spot and Stay there...<br />Freebird is basically Skynyrd's Version of Stairway to Heaven, not that they sound alike at all... but, they are alike in that they are both the best thing ever to come from their respecting bands, and they are both over 8min, but the cool thing is... YOU JUST DONT CARE!<br />Highly Reccomend this and all Skynyrd Albums... Rock on<br />10/10, A+, 0 things bad... whatever!
B000008GEF|5.0|Beautiful music from a beautiful guy. It's a shame there are folks  who can't appreciate this artistic flower. Isn't it a pity?  All the tracks shine. Don't succumb to your jaded inner cynic.  Buy this lovely offering.
B00005JMFR|5.0|The first time I saw Revolutions, I felt cheated. I loved the two previous movies, and I was really looking forward to seeing the end of Neo's journey. But the ending stunned me. There was seemingly no resolution, only more questions. I left the movie theatre in a sorry state of mind.<BR>But then....I started thinking: what does it all mean? What the h... happened at the end? I decided to go and see the movie one more time...and behold: I saw the light! All the philosophy, the religious iconology and metaphysical \\"babble\\" made much more sense to me. <BR>Now I love this movie. Not as much as the first, but more than the 2nd.It has the perfect conclusion to a great story. It couldn't have ended any other way, it was both unavoidable and inevitable.<BR>The question is: Are you going to enjoy this movie?<BR>The answer: It all depends on your expectations. You'll get out of it whatever you put into it.<BR>Free your mind & enjoy the ride!
0060005424|4.0|Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, but that fact is the only one that makes her one of the Clayr themselves.  In fact, she is actually ranked among the young children, for even at fourteen, she has not gained the gift of Sight...<BR>  So Lirael, Daughter of the Clayr, begins.  If you follow the winding path that the pages lead you on, you will find, (or at least, I found,) that this is a truly excellent book.  It has mystery, suspense, superb characters, and a wonderful flavor.  Although at some points I felt frustrated at the characters themselves-especially Sam-and at other points I wanted to give certain people-or animals, for that matter-a good stimulant, things resolved themselves in time to save me from closing the book in annoyance.  The book kept me interested throughout, and I finished it, like its prequel, Sabriel, in a matter of hours.  <BR>   The one major fault that I have with Lirael is merely a preferance of my own.  In a seiries, I like to have the same character be the major one in both books.  However, though Sabriel is definetly present, she is not the main character that she was in the prequel.<BR>   However, that position is filled admirably by Lirael.  She is joined by the Desrepeutable Dog, Mogget, and Prince Sameth, and overall they make up a fantastic cast.

B000002WU9|5.0|I love this album. I purchased &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx&quot; in '95, and it is my all-time favorite rap album. It is my favorite solo project of all the Wu members; pardon self 7s. I love the production on all the singles. RZA shined the brightest w/his production on this album. I am still energetic when I hear Criminology and Glacier of Ice. Only Built for Cuban Linx is the BOMB.
0679720200|4.0|I have often heard that in a translation, part of the story is lost. I could not help feeling this as I was reading this book. Although I feel as though I have missed a few things in Camus' message, the novel offers interesting (and sometimes bizarre) insights on certain subjects such as death, love, and religion. The grotesqueries in the book are often behind great thought, and because I read this in a day, a deeper analysis of the book might help in understanding some of Camus' intents. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick (but long lasting in thought) reading.

Like, what has this world come to? people are constantly mistaking garbage like this for music? My oh my, what a bunch of little poor misguided souls. From start to finish this CD is bound to sound like crap if Britney's singing, which of course she is! who told her she could sing? well whoever did, or whoever told her she had what it took to be a singer, apparently they were wrong! maybe she thought if she just showed a lot of skin she'd be really famous and to hell with how she sounds. Ughh, wrong again honey! For the love of God, please don't waste your money on this! I'm sure glad I didn't.
B000002H5I|5.0|i love the song fast car. it is one of the most beautifully tragic songs ever.
1582432678|5.0|Not exactly a fun read but brilliantly written. The suspense is taut, the characters are realistic and the ending is a shocker.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. When Judy Garlund sings \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" it brings tears to my eyes almost every time. I really hope they make this on DVD.
B00005OM4N|1.0|This album is just as awful as all of her other albums are! Foolishly, she believed whoever told her she could &quot;sing&quot; and went on to become a singer and now the poor girl is getting alot of bad reviews because of it. Yeah, well whoever encouraged her probably told her to show alot of skin and she'll be much more popular and famous, mostly by male fans. Well that was some horrible advice and bad encouragement she followed! Now she's making the most awful cd's and driving everyone crazy! (in a bad way). This CD is garbage and it pains me to even give it 1 star alone, I actually wanted to give it zero, but couldn't. It's far too generous of anyone to give this even one star! I saw this pic of a girl in a magazine who was obviously a big &quot;Britney&quot; fan. In the photo she was in her room beside her desk with shelves that had Britney Spears CD's, and even the doll and a big poster of Britney on the wall. I was so disgusted, I literally rushed to the bathroom and puked at least twice. So when listening to this CD, you're bound to do the same!
B00005JLK1|5.0|This movie is flat-out awesome. It has basically nothing new for <BR>horror movie buffs, but it's better than most horror films. It <BR>has a great cast, most of them unknown (except Julliana<BR>Margules) but the people acted wonderfully. The opening scene,<BR>in which a wire goes through a bunch of people's flesh is awesome<BR>for me, because I haven't watched that kind of movie in a long <BR>time. That scene is great, though it gets carried away with <BR>special effects. The movie is totally awesome and provides a <BR>great story and great acting. I hated the ending, because it <BR>doesen't really tell you what actually happened. Hopefully, there<BR>will be a sequel. We can hope though!<br />Parent's Advice<BR>This movie contains graphic violence, nudity and very coarse <BR>language. *15 and Up*
B00003CWL6|3.0|This was an interesting, but not spectacular film from 1999.  Watching it again recently, I noticed how dull it was to watch - particularly the long drawn out scenes with the neighbour's son and Spacey's daughter.  <br />Is American Beauty really as good as you may have heard?  Unfortunately not.  The hype that surrounded this film in 1999 made people go and see it.  There was also considerable hype surrounding Anette Bening's performance. Let's just say her performance was okay, nothing spectacular.<br />American Beauty is a good, but over-rated film.
0671004611|2.0|I am a mathematician and worked at Bell labs for many years (mid 70s to 2000).  I believe  the Roswell incident did take place and has been covered up by out government.  I also believe that it is plausible for a government agency to have farmed out technology from the crash, to industry, to be developed into usable products.  However, I do not believe Corso's account...<br />Corso's description of how 'alien chips' were reversed engineered into integrated ciruity is not believable.  Come on folks - with the speed at which computer technology is evolving today a 'circuit' of 100 years from now will probably not be based on silicon, will more than likely utilize light to carry information instead of electricity, and will more than likely not be 'etched' as today's circuity is.  Assuming the Roswell alien's are more than 100 years in advance of where we are today we are looking at what - Quantum computers based on organic molecules or maybe a technology which we can't even imagine today?  Just my $.02.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Britney Spears isent back at all. Her new album \\"in the zone\\" clearly states that spears isent quite IN THE ZONE. Her album has (4) Great songs, \\"Outrageous\\", \\"Touch of my hand\\", <BR>\\"Breahte on me\\", and \\"Toxic\\". The rest of her songs reak with electronic voices, and off rythm beats. She \\"trys too hard\\" with this album. I was surprized she debuted at #1, \\"it must of been all the fans that had fallen for her first single\\" <BR>\\"Me agianst the music\\". Speaking about me aginst the music, the only reason why it sounded \\"OK\\" was because of madonna, other wise its \\"wishy washy\\" and \\"Boring\\". She wants to be a sexy symbol, but that's all ready taken by Willa Ford. Britney, quit smoking, quit crying about justin and GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER! <br />      In conclusion, if you have $12.99 that you dont want to waste, than Save it. This is not the album you need to run to, yet walk to. You can wait for this one and donate the money for a better cause. ( for the homeless )
B00005JLT5|5.0|I did not like &quot;Schindlers List&quot;. That movie was too Hollywood driven. &quot;The Pianist&quot;, on the other hand was detailed, richly engaging and incredibly sad.<BR>Adrien Brodie was the perfect choice as a Holocaust survivor in this true story of the horrific nature of WW2. Only Roman Polanski could make such a film. Over 3 hours in duration, but you will not notice because the film is so engaging, if not difficult to watch at times.<br />The DVD itself is a must-own, along with &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot;.
0385504209|1.0|The book starts out promising but quickly turns into a flat \\"thriller\\" complete with preposterous plot twists and cookie-cutter narrative.<br />The female lead is there only to provide an audience for Langdon's many lectures on symbology, while Langdon himself seems to exist only to lecture on the story's religious premise and to treat the female character like a helpless damsel.  Did I mention she works for the French version of the FBI?<br />The book's premise is interesting - the true nature of the Holy Grail - but is far better suited to a history book than a thriller that feels like a rejected movie screenplay.<br />The overly simplistic clues are especially frustrating.  One of Brown's more \\"clever\\" puzzles is this one: an orb of \\"rosy flesh and seeded womb\\" associated with a certain author of the laws of physics.  Oh, and it's a five-letter word.  It takes a Harvard professor several chapters to figure this one out?  Puh-leeze.  Where's the suspense in something the reader knows pages and pages ahead of what the author reveals?<br />The anticlimactic ending is a complete letdown, since the story never deviated from my step-by-step predictions.  (...)
0783232039|4.0|I did not enjoy the original Chucky movie, and steered clear of the second two.  However, with Bride of Chucky (the fourth in the series), I had heard many great reports, so decided to take a chance and hire it.  Boy am I glad I did, because it was a very refreshing and funny film to watch.  <br />The film is a send-up of the whole Chucky idea in a way.  It can be considered black comedy to an extent, but it's important not to take the film too seriously.  Just sit back and enjoy the excellent special effects and humour.  In my opinion, Jennifer Tilly steals the show from beginning to end.  You will love it when she becomes a doll.<br />I just watched this for the second time.  I first saw it in 1999 and wondered if would still have the same impact.  It did, and I thoroughly enjoyed it all over again.  <br />DVD SUMMARY - Unfortunately the DVD version I have only offers full screen format (1:33).  This is the sort of movie that will be enjoyed more in widescreen, so make sure you get the DVD widescreen version (1:78)
B000084T18|5.0|50 Cent album is hot 2 death!!!!<br />Track after track is hot!!! I am a die hard fan of 50's being that I know him personally and I knew 50 when he was a boxer named Problem Child chilling in Southside Jamaica, Queens ya heard me!!!

B00005R24G|5.0|Sleuth is Anthony Schaffer's play of mystery and murder brought to the screen. If you are an Oxford scholar you will have no problem with this film. Others may require a dictionary as this is a very erudite work. You also cannot blink, cough, or let your mind wander for a moment or you will lose your place as to what is happening. I say these things because they are true and because it is one of the most intelligent scripts ever brought to the screen. I can only compare the &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; script that was done by John Mortimer to match this production from 1972. Michael Caine was at his best, and although Oliver's performance on screen seems top notch, if you have read anything on the making of this film it was reported that he had trouble learning his lines among other distractions. The SETS on this film are memorable! VERY EXPENSIVE and CUSTOM games are everywhere.The music is VERY atmospheric, from the harpsichord improvs to the old Cole Porter tunes. Unusual in that it features only two men without the mandatory love interest that pervades every American picture but their duels do concern a love relationship with women of mutual acquaintance. Oliver is a mystery writer who has a character, St. John Lord Merridew solve all the plots ala' Hercule Poirot. The play and film are tributes to the classic detective fiction of the golden age of the 1930's. &quot;Where every cabinet minister had a thriller by his beside and all detectives were titled.&quot; He uses his talent in mystery to entice and trap Michael Caine (his wife's current lover) in a series of games of death within the mansion meant to scorn and ridicule by upper class methods and put a trumped up pantry boy in his place! Caine turns the tables as Inspector Doppler drops by and makes Oliver believe he is going to jail for murder. Eventually the duels lead Oliver to crack under insults to his manhood and he performs the ultimate deed at the untimely arrival of the real police and sees hisworld that he created of games end in real life tragedy.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has come up with a new CD and i have to admit, it's really good. It's short though (at least 36 minutes). Here are my reviews:<br />Forword: a nice intro especially when the glass shatters. Too short though.<br />Don't Saty: A great song. A lot of Chester<br />Somewhere I Belong: I've heard it too much but it's still good.<br />Lying from you: It's my favorite song. I just don't like how some of the words don't fit the song.<br />Hit The Floor:One of my favorite songs. Rapping. singing. It has it all.<br />Easier to run: Kinda like Crawling but Crawling is a lot better.<br />Faint: I like this song. Fast singing by Chester and Mike. But the song is short.<br />Figure .09: A great song. It expresses my feelings.<br />Breaking the Habit: It's one of my favorite songs. It's got violins but 6 or 7 years of working from Mike Shinoda isn't really worth it. But i still like this song.<br />From The Inside: The lyrics are kinda out of the tune but still good.<br />Nobody's Listening: All good. The japanese flute and rapping. I ike it how Chester sings the chorus. Some of Mike's Lyrics don't fit in.<br />Session: Like Cure for the itch but alot better. This was also in The Matrix Reloaded album. Great instrumental song.<br />Numb: A very good song i like the tune to it. At least the words fit into it heh. <BR> I hope this was helpful...
B00005JMQ0|5.0|I had the opportunity to attend the premiere at Boston's Kennedy Library today for invited guests of Mr. Morris.  Mr. McNamara was in attendance and took part in a question-&-answer session after the screening.  As a college student at both UCalBerkeley and then at University of Wisconsin in the 1960's I lived through those most distressing times both for my generation and for my Country.  This fast-moving documentary, at times difficult to watch given the emotional involvement we had with the subject during the 1960's, is superb!  I came away feeling that I had not completely understood the role Mr. McNamara played during the Kennedy/Johnson administration or any sense of his humanity.  It will be several days before I truly can compose my thoughts but this is a documentary that must be seen by anyone who lived through the Vietnam era or who wishes to learn from the mistakes made during those troubling times.
B00011ZBXO|5.0|After I went and saw this movie, I couldn't get it out of my head for days! I loved it...absolutely loved it! It made me laugh...it was beyond the usual humor, which made it more funny. I own the soundtrack and the shockumentry also. Love it all. I can't wait to buy the movie in February and watch it again and again!
B0000C6E4D|1.0|A poor album.  Glossy, weak, boring, and overproduced.  Her previous studio efforts were sophisticated in their production but the artist was authentic and soulful in her delivery.  It is amazing how such a beautiful voice can fail the listener when you can't feel the same soul behind it. Sounds like a boring pop country album (of soft adult contemporary pop/rock).  Everyone I have played this album for dislikes it.  There is one descent track tucked away in this album, but overall the quality of songs are poor and very much the run of the mill.  Very little originality here.  The commercial masses will be satisfied but die hard fan will easily know the difference.  It will still sell but not nearly as much as her last album.
B00005JL96|5.0|Prior to seeing 'Lilo &amp; Stitch,' I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this film.  When I was at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, CA during July 2001, I saw a sneak preview/trailer of this film.  I wasn't so sure if I wanted to see it or not.  When the film hit theatres, I had failed to see 'Lilo &amp; Stitch.'<br />When the movie saw its DVD release, I didn't buy it.  When the movie premiered on ABC a few months ago, I managed to see all but the first 20 minutes or so of the film.  I had realized that I was missing a great Disney masterpiece.  So, I decided a few weeks later that I wanted to buy the movie.  When, I saw the film in its entirety.  Wow, man...just...wow.  'Lilo &amp; Stitch' became one of (if not the) my favorite Disney films.<br />This film is rated PG, so this is a darker film, compared to most other Disney animated films, but this can be enjoyed by all (though the youngest audiences need to watch it with older people).  Not every family is fortunate, and the family of Lilo (Daveigh Chase) and her older sister, Nani (Tia Carrere), is one of those broken families.  The two sisters struggle to stay together since their parents were killed in a car accident.  They see frequent visitations from the social worker, Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames), and he checks to see if Nani is doing a good job taking care of Lilo.  Then, came a monster (which Lilo thinks he is a dog), experiment 626 (created by 'evil genius' scientist, Jumba Jookiba (David Ogden Stiers)), arrives on Earth on the Hawaiian island of Kauai.  Later on, Lilo chose a new pet...which was 626.  She renamed him 'Stitch' (Chris Sanders).  Lilo never fit in with the rest of the crowd, while Stitch never had a family.  Similarly, both had very bad behavior.<br />Just when you thought things couldn't have gotten any worse for Lilo and Nani, Stitch causes chaos in shops, at the beach, and even at the Pelekai house (Lilo &amp; Nani's residence).  Little do Lilo and Nani know, Stitch was being watched and hunted by two aliens, Jumba and Pleakley (Kevin McDonald).  The two have trouble capturing the experiment, and end up being fired from the job.<br />During the middle of the film, Lilo teaches Stitch about love and the meaning of 'ohana' (which is Hawaiian for family, and it means to never be left behind..or forgotten).  Stitch's behavior gradually changes throughout the film, and begins to feel sympathy for Lilo.  Suddenly, Jumba and Pleakley arrive at Lilo's house, and go after Stitch.  Stitch and Lilo get away, until another space creature, Captain Gantu (Kevin Michael Richardson) arrives, and capture both Lilo and Stitch.  Stitch frees himself, but Lilo is still in Gantu's hands.  Nani realizes that she may never see her little sister ever again.  Things change, as Jumba and Pleakley start to sympathize Nani.<br />Stitch and the gang go after Gantu's ship, and attempt to rescue Lilo.  At the end, things go well for the Pelekai family, and have new members of the family..including Stitch, himself.  The ending was great..showing images of Lilo, Stitch, Nani, David (Jason Scott Lee, Nani's boyfriend), Jumba, and Pleakley.  During the whole film, I had some really good laughs (Pleakley was very funny, IMO), I nearly cried when Stitch was feeling lost, and when Nani realized that Lilo is captured by Gantu.<br />The music is really awesome.  You won't find many original tracks in the soundtrack.  That's because you'll hear many Elvis Presley hits on the movie, which was perfect for the film.  The tunes from Mark Keali'i Ho'omalu &amp; Kamehameha Schools Children's Chorus were outstanding.  Don't forget the tunes from composer, Alan Silvestri (who did the soundtrack for the Back to the Future movies)...they are very good.  While I didn't care for the A*Teen's remake of &quot;Can't Help Falling in Love&quot;, I did enjoy Wynonna's version of &quot;Burning Love.&quot;<br />Even though &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot; are the bigger blockbuster movies, I feel that &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; beats both of them (though I like the other two films, also).  I feel that this movie is somewhat underappreciated, and many people are missing out on a great adventure.  Never judge a film by the trailers alone.  I did that, and in many cases, my impressions of the movies change.  You'll laugh, cry, and be amazed at the same time.  This IS a classic film, thanks to Chris Sanders and the rest of the team behind the Disney film.  Everyone should see &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch.&quot;  You will not regret it at all.movies, I feel that &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; beats both of them (though I like the other two films, also).

B00008PX8P|5.0|First off, I play drums and the legendary John Bonham has been a huge influence on my playing. So I could hardly wait for this DVD to come out. My first review here several months ago must have broken some kind of rule or gotten lost in cyberspace or a server crash. Either way, here's another try.<br />The whole DVD is quite simply a work of art. Some of the scenes do seem a little dated (Page and his bow), but compared with all we had before this ('The Song Remains the Same' movie); this is state of the art stuff!<BR> <BR>As I stated, I am a drummer. So of course, I love Bonham's prominence in this DVD set. It appears Page went out of his way to appease us drummers, and I'm very grateful. But I'm also a frustrated bassist, vocalist and guitarist, so I was equally enthralled to witness the genius of each band member. Of course Bonzo and his bombastic wall of sound and very scary bass drum work (with a single Ludwig Speed King pedal folks, how the...!!??) is Nirvana to me. But I also loved watching John Paul and Bonzo reign in Page as if in some kind of mental telepathy! Page would be wandering a little too long with some guitar solos, and Jones would tolerate it for awhile, then he would glance at Bonzo and they would force Page back into the real world with a vengeance. 'Achilles Last Stand' is a good example of this; and a blistering version also because I truthfully didn't think Bonzo could pull this one off live, but he showed my mortal self just what a real, technical hard rock drummer can do!! I watch it over and over because he nails the time changes and rolls perfectly! Not to say I don't love Page's playing, because I do. He was and is a master of the guitar and writing rock music.<br />I also love Plant's vocals, and you've got plenty here on this DVD. But they aren't as clear and up front as I'd like, since Plant really is an underrated vocalist. I love trying to mimic his primal, sensual squeals and complete abandon, so I was a little disappointed the vocals weren't more prominent, but it's a trivial thing because the footage of Bonham more than makes up for that minor irritation.<br />So, if you love Led Zeppelin or any of the band members (or all of them, like myself), you have to get this DVD! You'll laugh at some of the dated parts, but the jaw dropping musicianship will leave you in complete awe and make you realize just why you started playing an instrument in the first place, and why there will never be another Led Zeppelin without Bonzo. We drummers are a dime a dozen, but a select few are truly great artists, and Bonzo was a master artisan, just as Page, Jones and Plant were and are at their crafts.
B00009RDG9|2.0|A huge amount of talent has gone into a pretty thin chase movie which has none of the panache of say The Fugitive.  Undoubtedly, Mr Jones and Mr Del Toro are watchable (and bankable) actors.  Because it is R rated - lots of knives and descriptions of how to carve up a man - it's audience I guess is lonely young men who fantasise about violence, or who have a thoroughly unhappy view of humans and relate better to dogs and squirrels than they do to their neighbours.  Interesting to see Mr Maltin gave this an above average review whilst considering the director's earlier masterpiece - To Live and Die in LA - an unworthy film.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, which is why I purchased this DVD. Of course, I'd watch it everytime I get a chance to. I definitely recommend buying it and seeing the movie again and again.

0060254920|4.0|Sendak's _Where the Wild Things Are_ is another of those classic books from my childhood--this one even won a Caldecott. It's a simple story with some good artwork--perfect for kids.

B00005JLR6|5.0|Jim Sheridan's IN AMERICA, though you may not realize it when you watch it, is a fable about wishes, dreams, good defeating bad, families growing stronger, love outlasting all adversity and America as the land of opportunity. It's a delightful film, touching without being too cute.<br />One thing you must realize throughout the film, when it takes turns toward optimism when other films would grow darker, is that the story is told through the eyes of Christie, the 10-year-old daughter of an Irish immigrant family recently relocated to New York. She narrates the story. She speeds it up and slows it down as she needs to. She talks of her sister Ariel's fears, of her mother's strength and of her father's lost smile. And, most importantly, she puts a positive spin on each of her proud family's struggles.<br />Another director might have taken this same story and gone in a different, darker direction with it. The elements are there, certainly. The family is poor, living in a tenement alongside beggars and drug addicts. Johnny, the girls' father, is an out-of-work actor who's uprooted his family to escape sad memories of his son Frankie, who died. Mateo, the next-door neighbor, and Sarah, the mother, are both faced with life-threatening conditions.<br />But the atmosphere that Sheridan provides us in this film is comforting and light. The city is enchanting. The tenement is both scary and magical, depending upon the story that Christie is telling the audience. No adult problem goes unsolved for long, even ones that seem particularly bleak. Throughout these positive twists, the importance of the narrator is key. Happy endings are important to a little girl, particularly one who feels so responsible for her own family. At one point in the story, for instance, she saves the family from their latest crisis and relates to her father that she's been the family's savior for a year.<br />Though it focuses on her entire family, it's Christie's story. And, while she's telling it, it's really moving and uplifting.<br />The acting here is uniformly terrific. Paddy Considine, playing Johnny the father, is a revelation. He's attractive, strong, a little crazy and yet weighed down by grief. Samantha Morton delivers another compelling performance, yet she comes off here as sweeter and more sympathetic than she did in the disappointing MORVERN CALLAR. Djimon Honsou, best known for his work in AMISTAD, is absolutely spectacular as Mateo, the girls' doomed neighbor. And Sarah and Emma Bolger, real-life sisters playing the girls in the film, manage the difficult task of playing adorable, likable, distinct children without coming off as entirely too precious and cute.<br />The script is terrific, and the direction is quite good.<br />IN AMERICA is just lovely.t's really moving and uplifting.<br />The acting here is uniformly terrific.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm sorry for those who don't like Britney Spears, but the fact is that \\"In the zone\\" is an outstanding album! Britney is much more mature in her 4th record and finally sounds the way she looks. \\"In the zone\\" was produced by the best people in the music market and it's a success in every part of the globe.<br />The first single, \\"Me against the music\\", features the queen of pop, Madonna! I love this song. At the beginning, it's weird, but it's the kind of music that grows inside of you and makes you feel great.<br />The whole album is great. I really enjoy \\"I got that boom boom\\", \\"Showdown\\", \\"Breathe on me\\", \\"Touch of my hand\\" and \\"Everytime\\". The best song in this album, \\"Toxic\\", was chosen by Britney as a second single. It is modern and very well produced!     <br />So, if you just want to criticize Britney -- for the fun of it-- look for something else, because this album is great!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore did a really good job with this soundtrack. And there can't be a better ending song than Annie Lennox 'Into the West'. And Billy Boyd has such a beautiful voice at the end of 'The Steward of Gondor'. I would really like to hear him sing more songs now. These are my two favorites on the soundtrack but its all good. Annie Lennox definately deserves an award.
0385504209|5.0|I have been a devout Catholic my entire life.  I was raised Catholic and have been involved in the Church.  When I purchased The Da Vinci Code, I really did not understand what the entire premise was.  I am a avid reader and the book looked very interesting.<br />After I read the book, it made total sense to me about the way the Catholic Church has viewed women.  I still believe that Christ is the Son of God, but I also believe that he was a man.  I am totally energized by this book to find out more about what has been left out in the last 2000 years.  Pick up this book and read it with an open mind. Women especially should pick this up and again feel empowered by there special ability to bear children.  The Church has done many great things, but it has supressed women and we have been made to feel dirty when it came to anything sexual.<br />This is a fantastic book.  I could not put it down and have given this book to other Catholics for Christmas.  I know there are people who will say this is hypocritical, but I know there is something missing from the Church.  It is evident in attendance and the number of priests we do not have.<br />READ READ this book, it may change your life and the way you feel about being a woman!!!<br />Dan Brown has picked a great time to come out with this novel.  I researched the Opus Dei, and became a believer in what he has written.

B0000041Q3|4.0|This is a really good recording.  I think Sutherland is wrongly cast but it seems to work in the studio context.  Pav sounds great (although only sang this twice live as his voice was too small).  To really hear Turandot sung you must try Nilsson, whose voice was obviously vast (BTW: I agree with the comments about Nilsson's pitching which is often all over the palce- listen to her famous Tristan on Deutsche where she sings a quarter note below Windgassen at the start of the duet!!).  Corelli is better than Pav on the Molinari Pradelli version, but this one is much better conducted and much better played and the choir does not have those awful screeching sopranos that you hear in the Rome chorus.
B000065V41|5.0|All of the other reviewers are correct. This version is one of the best. Miss Piggy is delightful as Ma Cratchit, sort of Julia Child gone wrong, but the performance of Little Robin  Kermits nephew,as Tiny Tim is worth the price of the DVD. The coughing into the hankie will ruin you for all other Tims. Buy This Version!
B00005JMF6|3.0|As I watched this movie I had to figure out where this all was going. Halle Berrys excellent performance (once again) was blinded by the movies twists and turns creating a new surpirse that spoiled each second of the movie. I did enjoy watching this phsycotic thriller but at the same time was still trying to figure out the connection between the real life murders in the movie and the surpernatural ghost of a girl who died 4 years ago leading Halle to be the hero of every cause. What was the situation of the mental visions that Halle and Penelope suffered? How did the ghost of the girl connect to the rest of the plot? These questions remained unanswered for me and my mind was still garbled by them. The ending to me was obvious and dull but at the same time making you beg for more. May the boy she saw at the end of the film lead to a sequel? Who knows, but the mental instution played no role in the main plot and a huge question lingered on my toungue. How was Halle lured to kill her husband and then become normal again 5 days later. The ghost of the girl lead Halle to every crime scene and every escape, it seemed the ghost character was put in thier just to fill up the empty spots.
B000069KGM|4.0|Horns have always been an important part in popular music.  When it came to rock and roll, however, the addition of brass was more for flavoring when they appeared.  It was a big deal when the Beatles added a full orchestra to Sgt. Pepper.  The Moody Blues Days Of Future Past was a fuller realization of the marriage of rock and orchestra.  But the use of brass as the driving force in rock was a brand new experiment.<br />Each musical instrument has a logic all its own and overall the kind of music with each in mind produces different sensibilities.  Hence songs written on the piano seem to have a wholly different taste than those written on the guitar.  (Think of it as the difference between \\"pounding\\" and \\"strumming\\".)  Blowing your lungs out through a metal tube produces songs sensitive to the breathing requirements of the musician.  Hence the alteration between notes with long sustains and musical sounds as a series of stops and starts.  This is why Chicago Transit Authority sounded so fresh and different at the time.<br />This album, sometimes referred to as Chicago I, came from nowhere.  It almost stayed there.  Many if not most did not discover this album until after Chicago released their second album.  While Chicago II was more popular, Chicago Transit Authority was actually the stronger album.  The first six cuts are very strong and form the backbone of Chicago's string of hits.  Even today, \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\". \\"Beginnings\\" and \\"Questions 67 And 68\\" sound masterful and confident.  The musicianship is professional in the best sense of the word.<br />This is not to say that Chicago Transit Authority bats 1000.  I am not sure what we made of it at the time, but today \\"Free Form Guitar\\" sounds like the guitar player got a new effects pedal and was just goofing around.  The topical \\"Prologue, August 29, 1968\\" and \\"Someday (August 29, 1968)\\" were supposed to be deep reflections on the events of the Chicago Democratic Convention riots.  These \\"events\\" are largely forgotten today; thus we have a lot of dramatic and ponderous music over a minor historical footnote.  Yet \\"I'm A Man\\" And \\"Liberation\\" still stand up.<br />For the average listener, any one of the retrospective or \\"greatest hits\\" packages are more to your interest.  But there is something to be said for going back to the \\"source\\".  Many regard Chicago as ultimately a brilliant but failed experiment.  Many regard their later work as swill for adolescent girls and high school band nerds.  But Chicago Transit Authority is an album of grace and power that demanded to be taken on its own terms.  Not bad for a bunch of music majors.These \\"events\\" are largely forgotten today; thus we have a lot of dramatic and ponderous music over a minor historical footnote.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|I have never seen a movie about drug abuse that is so raw and real, it blew my mind away. Requim for a Dream grossly comes to terms with the reality of drugs and its effects. A physcotic path spiraling down to destruction is the main theme of this movie. Revolving around four characters who all have a connection this movie does what other movies cannot. It doesn't shy away from the grim reality of drug abuse which is raw and not made for tv. The most merorable and imagery scene is where Ellen Burstyn's character is consuming diet piils and coffee until she abrubtly gets a ravenous appetite for food but pushing herself back in order to lose wieght (just to fit into a pink dress) the food attacks her when the refrigerator comes alive and attempts to consume her whole. This type of scene in a movie is what makes one think, &quot;What the F*ck&quot; but then again wow. Ellen's performance should've won the best actresse award at the Oscars instead of Julia Roberts performance which seemed so dull compared to this one. <br />Three words to describe this marvelous achievement; grim, raw, and amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better movie detailing the true reality that some are obscured by from happy fairy tale movies. Don't expect this to be a fairytale where the princess marries the prince..It will make the sqeamish hide under thier covers..
0553573403|5.0|This book is like a roller coaster: complex, slow to start, thrilling, and (hopefully) structurally sound.  Brilliantly realized characters wend their way through an intricate yet comprehensible plot.  Political strife, murder, fear, love, hate, betrayal, intrigue, revenge, magic and the supernatural, this book has everything you could want except a healthy dose of good cheer.  If you want your books to make you laugh, read Discworld instead.<br />Resembling real-world history much more than it does any heroic, swashbuckling fantasy tale, Martin's story is unrelentingly dark, brutally honest, honestly brutal, and very, very hard to put down.<br />My favorite things about this book are the characters and the world at large.  I'm told the setting is like historical England, and certainly there is enough geography and politics to go around, but what sticks out in my mind is the magic and monsters.  Supernatural means something not normal, but in many fantasy books, magic is everywhere, and monsters hide around every corner, until they become tedious and ordinary.  Martin treats his monsters like the rare, fearsome, otherworldly beings they are supposed to be, and they are much more interesting and frightening for it.  Likewise, magic is rare, deadly serious, and at least as dangerous as it is powerful.  Any schmoe can write Here There Be Dragons on a map, but George Martin makes you feel that they might really be there.<br />I also love believable, consistent characters.  A good plot is driven by characters: Whatever the writer feels should happen next, it should be the natural inclination of one or more of his characters to make that thing happen, or the story won't make sense.  A Game of Thrones is packed with real human beings, each with his own agenda, his own code of behavior, and so on.  A bevy of conflicts are presented and none are black and white: The only distinction between good and bad is that the good guys hesitate a little longer before breaking trust.  The lines between right and wrong are entirely rubbed out by the time you are finished with this one.<br />The bottom line: for hard fantasy that holds your attention and delivers on its promises, you can't do better than this book.  Put down The Wheel of Time and The Sword of Truth and give this series a try..

B00005Q4CS|4.0|The movie uses a lot of split-screen effects, like you see in those early Brian DePalma thrillers such as DRESSED TO KILL and SISTERS and so forth.  This and the time-lapse photography make the picture very engaging visually.  The characters and dialogue are fairly convincing, and the story moves along at a reasonably fast clip.  All of which are good things because, while the film is not entirely without a sense of humor, it moves inexorably toward a very depressing, hopeless conclusion.<br />I don't think the theme to the movie is simply \\"Don't Do Drugs\\".  The Ellen Burstyn character's amphetamines are doctor-prescribed.  An interview with the novelist/co-screenwriter Selby explains that the story is really about human suffering (hard to argue with that).  Most stories about suffering indicate that there's a point to the suffering, or at least that there's light at the end of the tunnel; but this one does neither.<br />So, entertaining and technically impressive, but also a real downer.
B00005JM02|5.0|I simply loved to watch this great animation movie. I recommend this movie to all parents who are afraid of letting their children fly away and to those who are obcessed about life's dangers. If you still have not children living with you, you have to see this movie just to know one of the funniest characters I have ever known... DORIS!!! You'll have to see it. And I loved the australian accent;) Must see it... and buy it!!
B00006JKON|4.0|After making two one-song albums in a row, &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot; and &quot;A Passion Play,&quot; and, as brilliant as both of those albums are, it was only inevitable that Jethro Tull would return to the short song format--apparently for good--with their next release, 1974's &quot;Warchild.&quot; As Ian Anderson says in the new CD liner notes, the songs on &quot;Warchild&quot; are &quot;whimsical, lighter in subject matter, and, above all, short!&quot;. The album contains many Tull favorites, such as &quot;Skating Away On The Thin Ice Of The New Day&quot; and &quot;Bungle In The Jungle&quot; (a U.S. top 20 hit), as well as the title song, &quot;Back-Door Angels,&quot; &quot;Sealion,&quot; and &quot;Two Fingers,&quot; a re-recording of an older, obscure Tull song, &quot;Lick Your Fingers Clean.&quot; Also, this new remastered version of &quot;Warchild&quot; not only has improved sound quality, but also contains a generous seven bonus tracks, including the excellent &quot;Paradise Steakhouse&quot; and &quot;Glory Row,&quot; as well as a pair of charming instrumentals, &quot;Warchild Waltz&quot; (an orchestral piece), and &quot;Quartet.&quot; Ian &amp; the boys sound great on this one, the songs are strong, and the band's performances and Ian's vocals very sharp. You can't go wrong getting this disc: &quot;Warchild&quot; is a fine Jethro Tull classic.
B000002J09|5.0|You say that Duran Duran were playing together a long time before \\"these jokers\\". Do you not realise that Duran Duran take their name from a 1968 film called 'barbarella'? Call me dumb, but don't you think it's a little strange that Duran Duran (who didn't make it big until the eighties) formed in the few months that passed before the Yardbirds fell apart and Jimmy Page formed Led Zeppelin in early 1969? I think you're just a little immature 13 year old that prefers listening to his dad's record collection rather than his brother's. Well, for the review. As with every other Led Zep album before Coda, it's a life changing experience in one little plastic disc. Buy it from your local independant record store today!!!!
B00005JM02|5.0|While I didn't get to the theaters to see this, I bought it Day One on DVD.  When I purchased this movie, my two year-old watched it constantly.  Now that she is older, she only watches it occasionally, but she still adores the film.Rarely am I entertained by my daughter's entertainment, but as usual, this film works on multiple levels, entertaining the little ones, who are wowed by the bright colors and action, to the adults who are sick of listening to baby talk in other insipid children's programming like \\"Teletubbies\\" and \\"Oobi.\\"  Several scenes (particularly with the 12-step sharks and possessive seagulls (\\"Mine!\\")) had me laughing out loud and silently thanking Disney/Pixar for producing more quality family entertainment.My daughter can sit and watch any of the Pixar movies from start to finish, and Nemo continues the tradition of great Pixar hits.  Like Toy Story I&II, Bugs Life, & Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo is great addition to the DVD collection of people of all ages.  Rarely do highly touted films live up to the hype, but this one does!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow!  This quickly canceled Sci-fi TV series from Fox made a big splash among fans of quality TV - Firefly was just too good for American TV!  That is especially true the usual \\"light\\" crap associated with FOX.<br />Firefly is NOT the usual \\"space-opera\\" but has it all... action, humor, honor, sex, a \\"wild-west\\" feel, an unusual visual filming \\"noir\\" and extremely good character development.  The emphasis is NOT the current trend in Sci-fi with aliens and bizarre shock takes but with realistic human interaction and an appeal to comradry... Moreover, this is NOT your usual blah-blah drama either.  There is NO BEEPING out of expletives - they are in Mandarin!  The dialog is a facinating mix of future, slang, and multicultural multilingualism... a nice refreshing change and not the least difficult to handle.  Here there is real life love and confusion...<br />The series was never given the chance to gain a large audience with weekly changes of air time and dates and thus failed the fox-test before the season ended.  The DVD collection, finishes most of the story lines but still leaves you wishing there was more (darn - do a movie).<br />Firefly is a rare gem when it comes to actor compatibility and dedication to a series and it shows... What a loss but then Fox is not known for intelligent moves.<br />Buy it if you like drama, westerns, sic-if or the like but beware it should be rated PG-13 or R with adult situations, some serious violence/torture, and some nudity...<br />GOOD JOB!

B000002H72|5.0|Something happened in 1990... something horrible, but something none of us knows about. Whatever it was, the big record companies finally got bands to conform, and a great dumbing down has happened ever since. Some think Nirvana was a wild, original band, but their themes were dictated by committees and research groups, not a word out of place, not a note that doesn't conform to corporate america's idea of what rock music is. But, here you have it, with Pixies Doolittle... the last breath of originality, the last great rock album.  Give this a listen, and compare it to anything made since... do you hear the joy in this album?  the intellectual gears turning? the fun of just being alive and creating?  Do you hear that in any album made since?  no you don't... here is the last album made before the matrix of conformity blanketed the music industry. Buy this cd and remember... there was a place called earth, where people could have a vision, then put that vision out for the rest of the world to share... Doolittle hurtles itself into space as the last example of human freewill... this was rock and roll.

B000002UR7|4.0|This guy who claims radiohead ripped off the hollies &quot;the air that i breathe&quot; is a Honky.  Totally untrue!  I downloaded the hollies song to see what this guy is talking about and about 5 seconds of the melody sounds like &quot;creep&quot;.  Other than that these two songs are far from being the same...different lyrics, mood, key, etc.  Of all the songs ever recorded in history, you're bound to find two songs that sound similar.  If you're gonna say radiohead ripped off the hollies, than the hollies sure ripped off the beatles.  You probably don't like creep bc its too depressing or whatever.  Anyways as for pablo honey, it's not one of the most important, most influential, most etc etc album of the 90's, but its definitely better than the cr@p on the radio today.  After all, this is the one that gave birth to the greatest rock band not named u2, or the stones.  Adios.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|As I watched this movie, I kept thinking that something was missing.  The look and pace were good (especially the use of Venice in the opening sequence).  The writing kept things moving (perhaps at the expense of characters).  But then I wondered: was it the actors?<br />He appears as a likable enough guy, but I've never been impressed with Mark Wahlberg.  When he's onscreen with Donald Sutherland, your eyes never leave Donald Sutherland.  Sutherland is a true movie star actor: even when he's just standing there, you're watching him.  And I don't get that with Wahlberg (his lack of screen presence made his dim fisherman in PERFECT STORM work and the apes in PLANET OF THE APES actually showed more expressions).<br />The relationship with Charlize Theron is about as by the numbers as any of the heists (that could've been a cool twist that Charlie's seduction of Theron was set up like a heist?).<br />Everything else seems to work.  Edward Norton is a suitable dirtbag and I wished the &quot;Handsome Rob&quot; character had more screen time.<br />The studio had a lot of faith in the film since it rereleased it before the end of last summer.<br />But I couldn't help thinking that something was missing, despite how well it played out on the screen.
B0000CNY27|5.0|A few years ago, MGM released a bare-bones DVD of EFNY and were rightly criticized for not including anything in the way of supplemental material. A glaring omission for such a beloved movie. The studio has more than redeemed itself with this new two DVD Special Edition that should please the fans.<br />There are two audio commentaries on the first DVD. The first one is with producer Debra Hill and production designer Joe Alves and focuses on production anecdotes and how the special effects of the film were achieved.<br />The second audio track is with John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, and is the one fans will enjoy the most. The two men joke and banter with each other like old friends and it is this relaxed, conversational tone that really makes this track such an enjoyable listen.<br />There is an excellent documentary entitled, &quot;Return to Escape From New York&quot; located on the second DVD. A treat for fans is all the new cast and crew interviews conducted especially for this documentary: the always radiant Adrienne Barbeau, the normally publicity shy Harry Dean Stanton and even the Duke himself, Isaac Hayes! They all speak fondly of their experiences on the film.<br />There is also a so-so a photo montage of how an issue of the comic book is put together, from rough sketches to its arrival in stores. In a nice touch, the issue that is shown is also included with the DVD.<br />&quot;Snake Bites&quot; is a collection of clips from the film scored to some atmospheric electronic music. This really isn't all that interesting and seems like unnecessary padding to fill out the DVD.<br />The other extra that has been eagerly anticipated by fans is the famous original opening of the film. Snake and his partner rob a bank and are caught with Snake being arrested and his partner being gunned down. This scene sets up Snake's arrival at the New York prison but Carpenter cut it because test audiences were confused by it. This footage was thought to be lost long ago. It is finally being presented in its entirety on this DVD. The footage is quite grainy but watchable and features an optional audio commentary by Carpenter and Russell (who had never seen the footage before).<br />Rounding out the disc are a nice collection of TV spots, a theatrical trailer, and a photo gallery with lobby cards, behind-the-scenes and production stills.<br />Escape From New York is a fast-paced action film that contains a dark, satirical edge that never falters, even right up to the film's conclusion. The DVD, with its wonderfully themed menus (done in the same style as the film), stunning transfer and top notch extras, ranks right up there with the excellent Big Trouble in Little China (1986) special edition set that came out a few years ago.

B0000TB050|5.0|As Bono once said in an interview, U2 lives out on the road, and no booteg, no DVD no Paramount movie has captured it better than the Slane DVD.  This DVD is significantly better than the Live from Boston DVD for so many reasons:  1) the DVD captures the spirit of the crowd, the organic intensity and passion in what U2 loves to do--make music--and the symbiotic relationship U2 feels with its crazy fans in a live show; 2) the filmmaking is much more spontaneous and rough, giving the viewer/listener a much more authentically visceral experience of an unforgettable U2 show; 3) all the songs in the lineup are included in the Slane DVD, namely, &quot;New Years Day,&quot; &quot;One,&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Ways,&quot; all staples of the Elevation tour but curiously not included in the Boston DVD, and 4) the sound mix is much more robust and enveloping than the elevation DVD: Edge's thrashing guitar during &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; and &quot;Bullet&quot;, Adam's rumbling bass during &quot;New Year's Day&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Ways,&quot; Bono's vocal passion as he howls at the wind during &quot;New Years Day,&quot; and Larry Mullen Jr.'s hard hitting drums during &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday. The introduction and the performance during &quot;Out of Control,&quot; sends chills.  Apparently, producer Ned O'Hanlon mentioned in an interview that signifcantly less money was spent on this production than the Boston show.  As U2 has been discovering with the last album, less is so much more.
B000002KXO|4.0|'Mirage' has always been known as somewhat of a rotten apple among the many albums of Fleetwood Mac.  It's easy to forget that it did make it all the way to Number One on the Billboard charts, something 'Tusk' failed to achieve three years prior.  While it isn't an outright masterpiece like 'Rumours,' or the experimental tour de force that 'Tusk' was, 'Mirage' has it's share of great moments, and holds up as a conservative but eclectic offering.<br />The big hits of the album were \\"Hold Me\\" and \\"Gypsy,\\" both of which became radio staples, and went into heavy rotation with their innovative videos on MTV, back in 1982.  \\"Gypsy,\\" in particular, is one of Stevie's finest moments ever.  She only has two other songs on 'Mirage,' the catchy, country-influenced \\"That's Alright,\\" and \\"Straight Back,\\" which could have easily fit onto one of her solo albums. <br />Christine is in fine form this time around, serving up the above-mentioned \\"Hold Me,\\" the radio-friendly \\"Love In Store,\\" and two superb ballads, \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Only Over You.\\"  When listening to the introduction of \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" I am reminded of the beginning of \\"Silver Springs\\" from 1997's 'The Dance.'<br />The glue that holds 'Mirage' together is Lindsey's five contributions.  While not quite as raw as his tracks from 'Tusk,' his offerings on 'Mirage' are more polished and glossier.  \\"Can't Go Back,\\" is my favorite song on the album, with the melody spinning around like a carousel at an amusement park.  \\"Book of Love,\\" \\"Empire State,\\" and \\"Oh Diane,\\" echo the styles presented on 'Law and Order' (his solo debut from 1981), and \\"Eyes of the World\\" foreshadows the mania which would overflow on 'Go Insane' (Lindsey's second solo release) from 1984.<br />If anything, 'Mirage' is a snapshot of a band that was heading in different directions in the early 80s.  I almost liken it to The Beatles' 'Let It Be,' in a sense.  When The Beatles recorded that album, they had other things in their lives going on,but wanted to make an attempt to get back to their roots.  A similar dynamic was at work in Fleetwood Mac when they recorded 'Mirage.' Four of them had solo careers/albums which they were about to or had embarked upon, yet there was a collective effort to make an album in the style of their high watermark, 'Rumours.'  The result was a respectable effort, which will always be remembered as the home to \\"Gypsy,\\" and as a classic album of the 80s.
B00006CJOY|4.0|This the the archive of the live creature that is Manu Chao.<br />This is the vital energy that the polished studio stuff springs from.  When he accepted a major European music award a couple of years ago everyone expected him to come out and play an acoustic ballad or something. Insead he shocked their sensibilities with a series of fast punk tunes.  <br />The key point is that his music is about the street and the energy of the street.  Sometimes that means guitar by moonlight, but other times that means banging pots and pans on the top of a barricade.  This album has some of the most energetic music you will ever hear, and some of the most thrilling music ever layered together in front of a live audience.  It is loud and full and no sonic gap is left unfilled.  A wall of sound.  <br />That being said, I would say that the energy in this album does lag in the second half and a lot of the tunes begin to sound the same on this long CD more from exhaustion on the part of the listener than anything else.  I suspect Manu still has a few steps to take before he gets to the level of Bob Marley - his idol - in crafting a subtle build to his concerts or compilation CDs.  If you accept that this album is about delivering an exciting message to young people and don't expect easy listening gems - not that there aren't delicate and beautiful songs on the album - then you will like it just fine.
B00005JM02|5.0|Anyone who says this movie isn't funny OBVIOUSLY lacks a good sense of humor. It's hilarious! Ellen DeGenres cracked me up so much, I was crying!! Literally!!<br />At first I didn't want to see this movie, because it had fish in it and I'm really scared of the deep dark ocean. But as more detailed trailers came out, I thought it looked really funny and I wasted no time in seeing it. I wasn't disappointed! But I do think it should've been rated PG, because there are some scary/tense moments for little kids (e.g. really big sharks who are freaky lookin' but are vegetarians).<br />Dory's expressions are just hilarious. She makes me laugh so hard, even when she's not talking! And the way she speaks whale, don't even get me started on how FUNNY that was! Every time someone starts talking about whales, someone else begins imitating Dory! IT'S FUNNY!!<br />I read one review on here that I thought was sort of mean. They said that Nemo's gimpy fin shouldn't have symbolized strength, and that there should've been jokes about it. How would you feel if you had one arm shorter than the other, and everyone poked fun at it? Besides, its not like the fin was cheesy. It was a result of almost being eaten by a baraccuda. And it makes Nemo even more like Gill.<br />I just have to say once more that this is definitely Pixar's BEST BEST BEST movie ever! Funny! Uproarious! I can't get enough! And everyone has to watch &quot;Exploring the Reef&quot; with Jean-Michele because it is SOOOO funny! Dory, Nemo, and Marlin are in it, and Dory is just as funny as ever!! (every time Jean-Michele says his name, this music plays triumphantly in the background, and the animated fish keep looking around to see where it comes from. It cracked me up!)<br />You should all see this because it's so funny!!

Of Mice and Men went from being what I thought was stupid, to what is now one of my favorite books of all time. <br />The story is simple, beautiful, and meaningful. So many morals pop up that tell you what life should be like, and how unjust the world can be at times. When I saw the movie version of this with Gary Sinise and John Malcovich, I almost cried.<br />George and Curley's wife were my favorite characters, both reaching for something they could've had, but can never posses. With each sentence your spine tingles, and you die to find out what's going to happen next.<br />Things surprised me. Shocked me. I wanted to scream at some points, because I couldn't believe what was happening.<br />I BEG you to read this beautiful book. If you don't, then you're really missing out.

The story starts out in Paris, France where symbologist, Robert Langdon, is on a business trip. While he is there, Langdon ends up doing much more than just a lecture. A murder has been committed in the Louvre museum and Langdon is one of the prime suspects.<br /><br />After reading this fascinating novel, it has come to be one of my new favorite books. As well as being an extremely thrilling, suspense-filled book, The Da Vinci Code also contains many interesting facts that will not let you put it down. One of my favorite things that Dan Brown (the author) does is he makes most aspects of the novel completely unpredictable. This makes it difficult for the reader to pull their nose out of the book. I also really enjoyed the fact that Brown did not bore the reader with too many tedious details. He never described the characters too much. This allows the readers to use their imagination and decide for themselves what they think the characters should look like. I loved how this stimulating tale made me question all of the things that I had learned and believed in before. It kept me curious and really made me think about what I was reading. The Da Vinci Code made me see everything in a new light. It allowed to me to open up my mind and discover new things.<br /><br />There were not many aspects of The Da Vinci Code that I did not enjoy. Most of the book was thoroughly enjoyable for me. One part of the book that I disliked was that Dan Brown seemed like he was trying too hard to make it unpredictable. For this reason, the book sometimes seemed a little unrealistic. I also found it frustrating that Brown sometimes used French without saying what it meant in English. Since I do not speak French, this made it difficult for me to understand some of the conversations. I would have also liked it if the book had pictures in some parts so I could get a better understanding of some of the Da Vinci paintings that Brown described. Though I did not enjoy every aspect of this exhilarating novel, I still enjoyed most of it and it is one of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />If anyone were to ask me what books I would recommend for him or her to read, I would recommend The Da Vinci Code first. It has become one of my new favorite books and it has inspired me in many ways. I give it five stars.et a better understanding of some of the Da Vinci paintings that Brown described.

B000089RVX|2.0|This was an utter disappointment... There are so many repetitous songs on this album that it gives me deja vu. &quot;Didn't I just listen to this song?&quot; kind of thing. Bring Me To Life is the best song on the album (no surprise it was the first single) but Paul Maccoy contributes to this a lot. And the worst? There's a lot of competition there. Tourqinet has potential but  never reached. Overall, it is just to slow... Not a catchy tune on the whole cd. Evanscence are trying to be deep and mysterious and it just doesn't work most of the time. Amy Lee's voice is far too soprano and grates like finger nails on a blackboard. She drags out every sylable and lyric like a funeral march. And the most annoying thing is that she never varies her voice (probably coz she doesn't have the ability) except on Going Under, which isn't really a great song anyway. If you want music to sleep to then evanscence will be your god-send.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Some critics have completely missed the point and statement made by The White Stripes. Their statement is:<br />* You can create good music with only 3-4 chords + beat.<BR>* You DON'T need 2 guitars + bass + drums + keyboards + brass + vocal to ROCK!<BR>* You need to stick to you guns, if you venture into a place where not too many bands have gone before.<BR>* You need to go back to basics.<BR>* Go back to analog (as this CD was completely recorded), nowadays anyone can sound &quot;awesome&quot; out the studio computer.<br />This CD enbodies those ideals. Sure, this music (as any genra) is not for everyone. Those who give negative reviews, obviously do not like their style and uniqueness. Further, I don't think people should judge the White Stripes until they see them live, then they REALLY ROCK THE HOUSE! <BR>Even more nonsensical are those who compare this LP to Rolling Stones or to Johann Sebastian Bach or to Wolgang Amedeus Motzart. If Bach, Motzart, Chopin, Vivaldi,  from the Classical, Reaction, Rococo and Baroque are your standards then NO BAND will ever even get close. Those are timeless geniuses of music and will never be superseded. To judge the White Stripes you should use a more apples-to-apples approach. Comparing with the Stones is no better or any stereotypical rock band, The White Stripes are a reaction to such stereotypes and should judged as so.<br />In short, if you're thingking in buying this CD please disregard those who have negatively commented based on comparing two distinct genras or comparing two different styles of rock.
B000063DGC|5.0|Randy Rhoads is the greatest guitarist ever because of his personality and his own style.This CD shows all of the greatest thing Randy can play.Randy was only 25 when he died but he is still here.If you have been listening to music for decades or just starting to get into it BUY IT RIGHT NOW!!This has AWESOME guitar!I really appreciate Ozzy for releasing this and Mrs.Rhoads. I love you Randy and I'll see you soon!(hopefully)
B0000028P8|5.0|Before Mariah's Unplugged appearance way back in 1992, critics were still skeptical about her singing ability. However, the TV appearance and subsequent release of this EP put any doubts to rest. The EP features live arrangements of some of her earliest songs. &quot;Emotions&quot; is presented in a new way, and &quot;If It's Over&quot;, in my opinion, sounds the way it was meant to.  &quot;Someday&quot; is still good if not quite as powerful. &quot;Vision of Love&quot; and &quot;Make It Happen&quot; both sound great. Then we get to Mariah's beautiful, powerful rendition of &quot;I'll Be There&quot;. This was rightfully Mariah's 6th #1.  The finale is one of Mariah's best songs, &quot;Can't Let Go&quot;.  As a whole, this may not be Mariah's best release, but it's worth the purchase to hear her live. The backup singers and band also help to enhance the performance.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I was pleased with the theatrical version of &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; but found it inferior to &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; still the greatest fantasy film ever made (though &quot;Return of the King&quot; may top it). Peter Jackson's brilliant expanded edition, part of yet another 4-disc DVD set that continues to redefine home video, has increased my understanding of the storyline and given a big boost to my respect for this second installment.<br />This extended version is marvelous, one of the great films, truly a rival for the crown currently worn by &quot;Fellowship.&quot; The characters are deeper, richer, the story meatier, the relationships better developed, and the build-up to the battle of Helm's Deep longer and more effective. I always felt the theatrical version of &quot;Two Towers&quot; was a bit of a choppy mess, hurling us from one locale to another without the over-arcing grace and feeling evident in the first film. Jackson has restored that sense of majestic pacing in the extended version, which I heartily recommend over the original release.<br />&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; cinematic trilogy is without doubt the most important film series of our time. Jackson has far surpassed even the earlier works of Lucas and Spielberg in bringing Tolkien's wonderful literary artwork to the screen. Having just digested the new version of &quot;Two Towers,&quot; it's obvious to me that the books and the films are equals. Jackson did take some liberties, particularly in &quot;Two Towers,&quot; with some of the characters, but in adapting such a difficult book for the screen, he deserves major credit for what he has achieved. Why neither of these magnificent films has won the Best Picture Oscar is beyond reasoning, but &quot;Return of the King&quot; might at last take home the prize.<br />Jackson emphasizes story over razzle-dazzle, though the computer-generated effects in &quot;Towers&quot; and &quot;Fellowship&quot; are miles beyond anything I've ever seen. There isn't anything in &quot;Towers&quot; that quite rivals the Balrog sequence in the first film, but Jackson's staging of the battle of Helm's Deep, the Ent attack, and his overall vision of Middle-earth continue to boggle the mind.<br />We are also treated to some memorable performances from a low-key, expert cast. I have only a few minor complaints about &quot;Two Towers,&quot; chiefly that we don't get enough of Gandalf, whose presence elevates the series into the realm of the sublime. Though Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Christopher Lee, Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and others deliver strong performances, the movie all but belongs to Andy Serkis, who (along with various software programs) plays the unforgettable Gollum. George Lucas really dropped the ball with &quot;Star Wars&quot; by inflicting us with such dreadful acting. Jackson doesn't make the same mistake.<br />&quot;The Two Towers&quot; is vastly improved by the additional scenes restored to the new DVD release and stands as a powerful middle-section in a series that will doubtless become a landmark achievement, bigger than &quot;Star Wars,&quot; way bigger than &quot;Indiana Jones.&quot; The extended version does a great job setting us up for &quot;Return of the King,&quot; which opens just a couple of days from now. I'm excited to see it on the big screen, but can't wait until next year, when it gets the deluxe DVD treatment. Now that will be more valuable than any One Ring you could imagine.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I first heard Damien Rice on (of all places) MTV2 while surfing the channels, and now I occasionally will watch in the early morning hours just to see if they have the balls to play it again. When I first listened to the album, I immediately thought the title of this review. It is simply that good! Jeff Buckley was good (if a tad overrated), and Elliot Smith was wonderful (RIP buddy), but this is the first man that can really hold a candle to Nick Drake. <BR>Perhaps what is most stunning about Rice is his ability to cross various styles of music on a whim. Of the first six songs, four start as folk songs, but then erupt into epic, fiery, orchestral pieces, in which Rice howls of his longing and love and lost love as if he truly means it. Meanwhile Volcano brings it down to a basic band with backing vocals from the beautiful Lisa Hannigan and cello, while Cannonball is just some fingerpicking guitars bouncing off each other. (Pink Moon) His sense of the soft, quiet romantic is also counterbalanced by his epic, desparate (yet never out of tune) screaming and howling for love in such a way that it simply gels brilliantly and just about covers the entire spectrum of human emotion.<br />But it is the last four songs in which Rice really goes out there. In Cheers Darling, an atmosphere is vividly painted of Rice alone in a smoky bar, drinking down his sorrows. Then Cold Water throws you against the wall with Gregorian style chants which one could never imagine would ever be seen on a folk/rock/baroque pop/something else album. On I Remember, the at first folk song is as violent as it is soft, quickly transmorgifying into a grunge song with massive electric guitar feedback. Then finally there is the grand finale, and how grand it is, complete with an opera singer, a grunge track, and then Lisa's a capella, haunting closer that almost seems to tell the tale of a post-apocalyptic world that will literally give you goosebumps if you're listening to it at 4 in the morning in the middle of New York City.<BR>Like many well deserving bands, Damien Rice probably will never get the mainstream attention he deserves, at least here in the States. It seems the majority of listeners aren't adventerous enough to handle this cross section of music. Just the same, I prefer having this sort of romanticism and intensity all to myself and my group of friends anyway. If you have (or need) a girlfriend or wife, perhaps this will be a perfect album to court her with.
B0000CDL93|5.0|Oliver Stone's &quot;JFK&quot; is a brave, powerful, radical film. It's also scary as hell. The movie explores our collective national nightmare about the assassination of the President and its potential links to Castro, the Mob, the CIA, and of course Vietnam and the Military-Industrial Complex. It does not merely suggest that a great evil befell our country that horrible day in 1963, but shouts it from the rooftops. How Stone ever got this movie made is beyond me. But I'm glad he did.<br />&quot;JFK&quot; is first and foremost a movie. It is not a documentary and it is not journalism. I agree with critics and others who find its value in its willingness to confront such a difficult subject and exhort its audience to question authority, use their &quot;eyes and ears and good sense.&quot; Did Oliver Stone convince me that Lee Harvey Oswald did not, in fact, act alone -- that none other than Lyndon Johnson and military defense contractors were in fact behind the assassination? Not necessarily. But this movie intrigued me and scared me and got me to thinking, and that is really the highest compliment I can pay a Hollywood film. Most movies are interested in only one thing: money. This one is interested in ideas, enlightenment, and seeking out the truth. That alone makes &quot;JFK&quot; a rarity.<br />Besides all that, it's a terrific piece of filmmaking, period. I'm not a big fan of Oliver Stone, but what he pulled off here is remarkable. &quot;JFK&quot; feels like a combination of Hitchcock and Spielberg, with maybe a little Brian De Palma and Frank Capra thrown in. From the photography to the sound to the editing, it's a masterwork, vivid and alive. Though there is a lot of dialogue -- and two scenes that amount to soliloquies of Shakespearean depth -- Stone never bogs down, never loses steam, never loses his train of thought. The whole movie builds up to a climactic courtroom sequence that pulls all the threads together into a picture of what MIGHT have happened inDallas that day. It then leaves us to think, and ask questions, and keep our own eyes open.<br />I want to mention three of the actors. First, Tommy Lee Jones, who is seductively evil as Clay Shaw/Bertrand. He deserved to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year, but of course there's no justice in that ceremony. Second, Joe Pesci, panicky and devilish as David Ferrie -- here's a whirlwind performance that dwarfs his fast-talking work in &quot;Lethal Weapon 2.&quot; Finally, Kevin Costner, turning in a powerful portrayal of Jim Garrison. Costner is in almost every scene, sometimes just watching and listening, but always credible in a role that took a lot of guts for him to play (after all, he is Stone's mouthpiece for a lot of highly unpopular ideas). Anyone who doubts Costner's acting ability has obviously never seen this film.<br />There are disturbing moments, many of them highlighted by pungent dialogue that gets right to the point. Donald Sutherland gets the movie's most gripping scene, walking Costner through all of &quot;the facts&quot; behind the assassination (it's a brilliant scene -- Garrison almost literally shuts down, he's so overwhelmed by what he's hearing). Lines like &quot;subtle as a cockroach crawling across a white carpet,&quot; &quot;it's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma&quot; and &quot;people like you just walk between the raindrops&quot; have a strangely chilling effect; simple lines that cast the drama in a sinister light.<br />Look, I realize that Stone altered some of the facts to fit his cinematic story (Ferrie, for instance, did not die under such suspicious circumstances). I know that the movie is not unbiased -- that it's a bald representation of the ideas of the man behind it. So what? Here is a movie that takes more risks than any other, before or since. It has flaws, but they are minor. &quot;JFK&quot; was the best film of 1991 and stands as one of my favorites ... disturbing though it may be.
B0000C6E4D|1.0|I fell in love with Sarah McLachlan... uhh, with Sarah McLachlan's voice... when I saw and heard her on daytime TV singing songs from Afterglow and accompanying herself on piano and guitar.    The CD is a shocking disappointment.   The producer seems to have thrown every instrument made plus some unidentifiable sounds into the mix, obscuring what might have been a good listen.  I feel cheated and unless she goes unplugged next time, Sarah's off my list.
0385504209|5.0|While Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist about to publish a novel, is in Paris on business, one of the greatest enigmas in history is dangling on a piece of string right in front of his face but is just out of reach. When the renowned curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniere, is murdered, he leaves a special note for Langdon on the floor next to his strangely positioned body that leads Langdon and his new friend Sophie Neveu, a gifted French cryptologist who happens to be Sauniere's granddaughter, on the quest to uncover a secret that has the power to completely change the world. Langdon and Neveu are led on a wild search through Paris and beyond that is made up of riddles and puzzles that only the smartest of men can figure out. But between Langdon and Neveu, the clues are deciphered and they quickly begin to uncover the greatest secret of all time. The problem? Langdon is the prime suspect in Sauniere's murder. And when Langdon discovers that Sauniere was involved in an ancient secret society that is guarding the greatest secret of all time, a whole new twist is put on everything. Unless Langdon and Neveu decode the clues that Sauniere has left around Paris for them to find, this great ancient truth will be lost forever.<br />  I had a strong penchant for nearly every single part of this spectacular story. What enthralled me a great deal was the fascinating codes and clues that were scattered throughout each chapter of the novel. Although I could not decipher any of these extremely difficult codes, they were so interesting that they, among other things, made it so that I could not put down the book and kept me on my toes looking for hints; when Langdon and Neveu figured out some of these codes, I learmed many extremely interesting facts about how the codes were broken. I also thoroughly enjoyed the historical secrets that were planted in the pages. Each provocative secret made me question everything that I had ever learned about religion and kept me so intrigued that I, again, could not put down the book. The way that these secrets were connected to history absorbed me and made me question the truthfulness of the Christian religion. These secrets, however provoking they were, made this book one of the most interesting that I have ever read. Another thing that really made it so that I could not put down the book was the enigma involved; each page left me yearning to discover more. Dan Brown's novel made me so curious that I could not stand it. Between the secret of the Holy Grail, the many mysteries of Jacques Sauniere, and the other enigmas, I was completely enthralled. There were very few things that I did not enjoy immensely about this novel. One was that at certain points, Brown tried to make the book so unpredictable that it became predictable. Another thing was that sometimes Brown bombards the reader with so much esoteric, heavy information that it becomes abstruse. However, by the end of the book everything gets cleared up and leaves the reader feeling educated and incredibly intrigued and fascinated. The final thing that I did not enjoy was that I was so interested in the book that I literally could not put it down and spent hours every day reading the novel to the point where reading took over my life but I had a great time reading it, none the less. Other than these few complaints, which are extremely minor, I enjoyed \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" remarkably and thought that it was a perfect, must-read. This novel was pure and absolute genius.<br /> I highly recommend \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" to anybody who enjoys history, mystery, thrills, puzzles, riddles, conspiracies, or just enjoys an amazing, extremely interesting story. Just as a precaution, I advise that you read this novel when you have time to be completely absorbed in a book that, quite literally, does not allow you to put it down. But, no matter where or when you read it, no matter what speed you read it at, you will absolutely, positively love Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".i Code\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fantastic Show. Wife and I watched nothing else until we watched them all. Went to sleep with the Theme Song in our heads. We laughed, wife cried (at some parts in Message and Heart of Gold). We shook our fists at Fox repeatedly. Most TV execs are lower than lawyers. We hope the execs at Universal (who now own Firefly) can prove that stereotype wrong...it up run with it!<br />If you've never watched the show. Buy this set. If you've seen one or two episodes, buy the set-watch them in order. If you even think you might kinda be interested, but the set. It's well worth the time and money
B0000AQS6R|5.0|If this film is not already a Christmas classic, it will certainly be in that group a few years down the road. Aside from the &quot;Vacation&quot; series, this movie stands on its own legs as a hilarious look into the life of Clark W. Griswold, trying to give his family the great American Christmas.<br />There are very few slow moments in the film, which contributes to the fact that you can watch it over and over and over again, not getting sick of it (remember - a classic). It is also filled with countless memorable moments and one-liners, almost on par with &quot;Caddyshack.&quot;<br />This film succeeds on two levels of comedy. The first is that it manages to place its characters in funny *situations* as opposed to simply having them try to speak funny lines. This is the mark of a lasting movie. The second level of success is in the humor itself (the dialogue, the one-liners, etc.). It has what it takes to be a classic.<br />As for the special edition, it's worth it because of the commentary, which includes Randy Quaid (Eddie), Beverly D'Angelo (Ellen), Johnny Galecki (Russ), Miriam Flynn (Catherine), Director Jermemiah Chechik and Producer Matty Simmons. They get off to a rough, slow start, but if you hang in there they eventually get it going. But where's Clark? I was very surprised that Chevy Chase didn't make an appearance on the DVD anywhere, and during the commentary the others spoke about him as though he were deceased. I wonder if there was a little falling out...?<br />The transfer to DVD is wonderful. The picture quality is great, unlike other recent releases like the special edition of \\"A Christmas Story\\" which contains no film restoration whatsoever. <br />All in all, this is one that you buy. You'll throw it in again and again starting around mid-November, and it will soon become part of your Christmas tradition.

B00005NG9Z|5.0|I have been a fan since the early '90s.  I kinda got hooked on them after they had already been around for a few years.  So I missed most of the videos that were released on MTV.  It was a pure treat to be able to see all these videos for the first time.  The only one I had seen previously was &quot;No Excuses&quot;.  I had the best time cranking the sound system up to the point my 350W sub was going to clip, turn down the lights, and become completely absorbed.  The 5.1 mix was really great, with just a few oddities like a cymbal crash coming from some strange direction.  The sound quality was much better that CD, you can definitly hear the difference.  One note, if you don't have 5.1, make sure you use the 2 channel mix or you will experience the same thing one of the previous reviewers did; missing channels.  The sound is so good on this that I actually program my DVD player to just play the videos (cut the behind scenes) and leave my TV off.  Then I just enjoy the great audio, just like one of those DTS music CDs.  I sometimes prefer the audio only so that I can have the lights off and listen in the dark.  As for the videos, they are all very good and fun to watch.  I especially like the hard to find ones like &quot;Get Born Again&quot;.  Go out and get this thing! It is almost cheaper than a CD and has better sound.
B0000029DD|5.0|Where do I start? Jeff Buckley is an underrated superstar! The most heavenly voice that fills my heart with enchantment every time I hear it. When I first listened to the CD 'Grace'it sent shivers down my spine! Jeff Buckley had the most amazing vocal range, but his music is so much more than that. He was an extremely talented man, and it saddens me so much to think what he could have achieved. Grace has personally inspired me, and every song brings back a different memory and brings a different feeling. My personal favourites o the album are ' Last Goodbye'' Hallelujah' and of course the title track' Grace'.There is not one bad song on this album, and each can be appreciated in its own way, as each is unique and special. This album is a display of pure, raw emotion and has never got the recognition that it truly deserves. All that's left to say is go and buy it as an introduction to the wonder that is Jeff Buckley. And once you have experienced the beauty of the music, spread the word! Jeff Buckley is an icon of our generation, and may be gone,but neither him or his music will ever be forgotten.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was cancelled before it even made it to the UK, which made the experience of watching it this summer (and again, now, on DVD) all the more poignant... and frustrating. While I won't go the 'reasons' behind the cancellation here, it seems clear to me that it was wholly unjustified; to anyone with any discernment, it's clear this show simply gets better with every viewing and every episode.<br />The cast is a joy; from captain of the ship Mal to endearingly crazy psychic River, every actor hits the note for their character time after time. Coupled with the great writing we've come to expect from Mutant Enemy, what we get is arguably the most perfect, and perfectly characterised, ensemble cast yet in a Whedon show. Sparky, believable dialogue (especially between Mal and Inara, but frankly every line sounds utterly natural - and often laugh-out-loud funny). Unforced character conflict (Jayne, for example, is a belligerent git, and as such a vital element of ongoing tension). Above all, a gradual, natural development of the ensemble's dynamic.<br />The look and sound of the show is similarly lavish in detail and feel. The costumes are simultaneously eye-catching and 'lived-in'. The sets are a brilliant meld of Western and SF, all dusty canyons and technology that is functional and *used*, as opposed to _Trek_'s ultra-sleek waiting-room ambience. The dialogue and incidental music both add to the hybrid atmosphere, with their own dialect of Madarin and archaism. <br />Overall, this is about the boundaries between genres being shaded in a quite ingenious manner - and it is mirrored in the genuinely hazy morality of the characters and their world. Want to see a real frontier in action? Look no further.

0884271153|1.0|I gave up reading this ridiculous book 2/3 of the way through and feel cheated of 10 hours of my life. I have never quit a book midway through).     The entire premise of this pile of kaka can be summarized as follows:  All conflict has one or two root causes - if you can determine those causes, you can solve your conflict.    Don't waste your money on this author's thinly disquised self-elevating drivel. How much did I hate this book? Enough to take the time to write a review. You will learn more by renting \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" than you will by reading this book.    I wish I could rate it lower. I want my money back.    --- My original review was written in 2003 - I'm amending it (dec 2007) I tried picking up this piece of crap with a fresh perspective and feel worse about it today than I did back then.

B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin II was the band's 2nd classic album of 1969. This album was also the one to truly open them to the mainstream due to the inclusion of their biggest and amazingly only top 10 hit \\"Whole Lotta Love.\\" This album is largely based on Jimmy Page's memorable riffs and is probably their heaviest album overall.<br />Many of the tracks here are hard rock classics. \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Living Loving Maid\\", \\"Bring It On Home\\", and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" are driven by heavy riffs and all still get consistent airplay on classic rock radio. Although these are the most popular tunes, the more diverse tracks are all strong as well. \\"Thank You\\" is a classic ballad featuring some of Robert Plant's most passionate vocals. \\"Moby Dick\\" begins with a killer riff before going into an excellent drum solo by John Bonham. \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" and the half-acoustic, half-electric \\"Ramble On\\" feature some of John Paul Jones's most creative bass playing. Finally, \\"The Lemon Song\\" is a drawn-out blues featuring one of Robert Plant's most memorable vocal performances. A fantastic album. Highly recommended.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|I have to jump in here and give this disc 5 stars.  Some have said this sounds a lot like a continuation of Scary Monsters and I must agree.  There are enough of his late 70's early 80's sounds on this disc (mixed with a lot of modern stuff) to keep true Bowie fans happy for years.  But don't let any of these reviews make you believe this is a rehash.  It's good stuff and very original sounding.
B0000630BT|5.0|I have a theory about how this masterpiece came to be.  Judas Priest, after releaseing Ram it Down, sat down one day and decided that they were going to make the perfect album.  On most of their previous albums, they had put one or more speed metal classics, and these were almost always the best songs on the album.  I'm talking about &quot;Ram it Down&quot;, &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot;, &quot;Exciter&quot;, &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;, &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot;, &quot;Freewheel Burning&quot;, and whatever other devastating speed metal they had put on their albums over the years.  Everyone knows that Priest + speed metal = instant classic  (Hell, even the speed metal songs on Jugulator (1997) were awesome).  Then one of them said something like, &quot;Let's make an album FULL of speed metal classics!&quot;  Another said, &quot;that's bloody brilliant!&quot;, and thus, Painkiller was born.  Actually, there is one song here, &quot;A Touch of Evil&quot;, that isn't speed metal, but it's definitely a great song.  Every other song is just crazy, awesome metal at its best.  Each and every song has its own reason for being absolutely mind-blowing.  All of the songs have amazing riffs, leads, vocals, and drums throughout, except for &quot;Nightcrawler&quot;, which doesn't have a lead.  Adding to this is a dark and intense atmosphere which makes every song even better than it already was.  The production is flawless.  Halford's vocals are at their best.  The drumwork is the best they've ever had.  Don't listen to some of the other review here.  The lyrics are just awesome, and fit the music perfectly.  It is obvious that almost every power metal band has simply been trying to make this album.  This may be the greatest album ever made.  Buy it.  Now!
B00005JL78|3.0|I put off seeing this movie for a while, simply because the prospect of having to simultaneously stomach the creative endeavors of Tom Cruise AND Steven Spielberg was just too much for me to handle.  However, it turned out to be &quot;not that bad.&quot;  That phrase can be attributed to far too many Spielberg flicks these days.<br />&quot;Not that bad.&quot;  Because, I mean, it was quite entertaining.  If anything, Spielberg has his plot arcs down pat.  The idea was inspired.  The eventual &quot;uncovering of the truth&quot; that accompanies most of his sci-fi films was well-paced, and the surprises are good.<br />The plot details, as well as the characters' backstories and motivations, weren't quite as good.  There are scenes where a character will expound upon something for several minutes and then do the antithesis of what they would be expected to do after such a speech.  No explanation is given as to why random strangers and even bitter enemies help out our brave protagonist along the way.  I don't mind having to do a little brainwork while watching a movie-- in fact, I prefer it.  But this isn't clever writing-- this is confused writing, and plenty of it.  In a way, it sort of reminds me of the Matrix trilogy, with people randomly walking around saying and doing random stuff and the screenwriters pretending to have a reason for it all.<br />And what's with Spielberg's vision of the future?  The way he portrayed consumerism and the internet seemed believable (and actually kind of neat, although the subsequent loss of privacy was eerie), but everything else?  Sick sticks?  Seemingly unlimited prison space for people who haven't even committed crimes yet?  A city even receiving the jurisdiction from the federal government to hold these people in indefinite stasis? Gap pants that actually fit? Give me a break and pass me some of those optimism pills, Steve.<br />What this movie is perhaps striving to be is a rehash of the old sci-fi standby: put not all your trust in things you don't understand, whether it be machines or psychic little girls or the justice system.<br />So, yes.  Tom Cruise looks like a bona fide hero (hey, it doesn't happen that often anymore).  Samantha Morton is hot, even when she's bald.  And for all my complaining, it's probably worth a rental.  You may not be inspired to ask yourself deep questions about crime, destiny, or privacy, but by gum, something in this movie is sure to compensate you for your time.ust in things you don't understand, whether it be machines or psychic little girls or the justice system.<br />So, yes.

0385504209|2.0|I've been listening to an audio version, luckily it was free (borrowed), because spending money on the hardcover would be a huge waste. But, reading the customer reviews has been very entertaining.<br />What is really amusing is that the reviews seem to run 4 to 1 in favor of the book. Lots of reviewers are claming &quot;The best book I ever read!&quot; or, &quot;You must read this fantastic book!&quot; and then providing long, admiring opinions. Many of these people actually are impressed by the writing style and skill of the author, but what really gets them is the &quot;historical fact&quot; that sends them to the internet for hours of research. The audience that's impressed seems to be composed of non-readers who might have trouble getting through a John Grisham novel, but are just thrilled to have a new conspiracy theory to explore.<br />The anti-book crowd is also somewhat split. The minority view seems to hold that the book is blasphemous and &quot;wrong&quot; because it disrespects Christianity and the &quot;true&quot; history of the church and Jesus. So, according to these folks, don't read the book because somehow this blasphemy is contagious and if it gets out, well, who knows what could happen. Most of the anti-book crowd, thankfully, seems to recognize it as just poor literature.<br />I belong to this latter set of critics. It seems to me that the author constructed a half-baked plot and a couple of weak characters, in an entirely implausible situation, solely in order to communicate his &quot;theories&quot; about DaVinci, the Sacred Feminine, the Grail, and all the other jumbled historical tidbits that add up to the aforementioned conspiracy. Then he wrote the book as fast as he could, knowing that he'd have a best-seller. How could he not? As I've noted, most of the reviewers on this site love it. It's a perfect book for people who prefer television and absolutely eat up conspiracy theories.<br />I'm still listening, because it's assigned for my book club. But I find myself wishing I could hurry up and get it over with.club. But I find myself wishing I could hurry up and get it over with.
B000063DI9|4.0|Some people claim that \\"Seventh son of a seventh son\\" (1988) shows Iron Maiden at their creative peak. To me, these kinds of comments have very little bearing because this album is very similar to many others regarding the material. Still, the opening track, \\"Moonchild\\" is one of the bands finer efforts and there are of course some moments here and there when Steve Harris and Co shine musically. <br />The previous album \\"Somewhere in time\\" was criticized for its use of guitar synths and some fans thought it lacked power, that it was a light metal album. But \\"Seventh son of a seventh son\\" has a couple of lighter numbers as well, and  \\"Can I play with madness\\" is perhaps Maiden's most commercialized track ever. \\"The evil that men do\\" is a rather easy listening track with Harris' galloping bass lines that has become a sort of trade mark, and \\"Infinite dreams\\" is a pleasant song with the characteristic changes in tempo and beat. The title track is an epic one, almost 10 minutes long, and it follow the same structure of many others, both previously and to come. \\"The prophecy\\" and \\"Only the good die young\\" are typical Maiden songs, rather enjoyable without having the ability to stand out from the rest of the material. \\"The clairvoyant\\" is another song built around the tempo and beat changes and even if it's a rather good one, it also gives a medley feeling since the pieces don't naturally fit into one another (but that doesn't seem to have ever bothered Steve Harris).  <br />Over all, this is a fine Iron Maiden album and you certainly get what you expect - there are no surprises! Still, I do think that albums like \\"Piece of mind\\" and \\"The number of the beast\\" are better, but \\"Seventh son of a seventh son\\" is clearly a stronger album than \\"No prayer for the dying\\" and \\"Fear of the dark\\", or anything with Blaze Baley\\" for that matter. Even if Maiden have sounded very different from this one at times, \\"Seventh son of a seventh son\\" might represent the Maiden approach best.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed Joss Whedon's FIREFLY on it's initial run on FOX, as it seems did most people, but I picked up the DVD after hearing some good things about the show, and was completely blown away. This has quickly become my all time favorite Sci-Fi series, with great writing, acting, SFX. This show is amazing. When so much of Sci-Fi (Think Star Wars or Star Trek) seems to have forgotten that it is all about great characters, this show has great characters in spades. Watch this DVD and you will see what fools FOX was to not give this show it's proper chance!<br />At least it sounds like Universal has picked this show up to do a feature in 2004. It isn't 100%, but hopefully it will happen, and maybe that will do well, and they can try and bring the show back!<br />I can't recommend this DVD any higher! Check it out! Fly on Serenity!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Defitively Cher is the Best Diva around the world!!!!!!! What a great concert!! What a great tour!!!
B00007BH5C|5.0|As a fan of soundtracks, this is one of the best musical scores ever composed for a movie.  It is shocking after hearing it to realize this did not even get nominated for an oscar, when this album is at least as good as the previous FOTR score, which indeed won the oscar.  <br />One of the requirements of a movie score is to create an audio personality for the movie.  When one hears the Star Wars tracks, the entire Godfather album, the Gladiator opening theme, even the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon &quot;Yo Yo Ma lingering cello&quot;, you immediately are transported to the movie's setting.  That is precisely what The Two Towers soundtrack does.<br />From the Nordic strings and horns to represent Rohan and Helm's Deep to the industrial aggressive beat of Isengard, every track in this album is as unique and stirring as the setting it represents.  Forth Earlingas is particularly beautiful and epic, and I guarantee will stick in your mind for a long time after listening to it.<br />But a special place in my heart is reserved for the song entitled &quot;Evenstar&quot;, as voiced by Canadian soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian.  This is truly esoteric, fey music to represent the scenes of Arwen visualizing life after Aragorn.  Close your eyes, put on your headphones, and dream of happier times in the presence of someone you love (or loved)while listening to this song, and I guarantee you will have tears come to your eyes as I did.<br />The only song I didn't like that much was the final track, Gollum's Song.  The music is fine, but the vocal stylings of Emiliana Torrini, who is trying to communicate feelings of despair and hopelessness, are truly awful and fall flat.  While hearing this, you will wonder &quot;what the heck is this doing here?&quot;  However, I am not going to hold a few minutes against what is one of the best movie scores I have ever heard.  Wonderful music.  I can't wait for Howard Shore's finale in Return of the King.
