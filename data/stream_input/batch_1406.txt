0307888908|3.0|I received this book with great anticipation. Reid Hoffman has achieved tremendous, well-deserved success with Linked-In. His vision, well executed, is serving many, many people, enabling us to serve others more effectively.<br /><br />'The Start-Up of You' is certainly a useful construct. We're all entrepreneurs now; we all must add value 24-7.<br /><br />These aren't new concepts at this point, though there's always the prospect of value in seeing them presented in new ways. Especially when offered from the perspective of a successful practitioner.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the most valuable parts of this book are those referring directly to Reid Hoffman's personal experience. More detail, a deeper dive would have been welcome in these sections.<br /><br />More troubling is the failure of the authors to adequately credit Tom Peters' work, pioneering the 'Brand You' concept. To be sure, a Peters book is cited among others for additional reading. Yet that does seem far too small an acknowledgment. It might have been appropriate, at the start, for the authors to discuss 'The Brand You 50' and make the case for this book in clear differentiation.<br /><br />'The Start-Up of You' may be of particular interest to people who are new to business, new to business books, and to anyone wishing to get a feel for the thinking of Reid Hoffman and Linked-In. Those seeking 'a bold blueprint for navigating the new world of work' might wish to consider additional, alternative offerings.
0470901071|5.0|The way this study guide is written makes even hardest topics easy to understand. The author has put a huge effort explaining every topic with many, many examples to make sure you understand it and nail all related CLI skills. If you want to master IP addressing and subnetting, routing and switching, this book is for you.<br /><br />What I also love about this book, it offers a must-have 15-lab simulation exam practice guide to hands-on practice essential CLI exam skills.<br /><br />In addition to that, the author makes sure that candidates are updated about new exam question types and objectives through his website and online community.<br /><br />It is a great investment. I passed the CCNA exam and still use this guide as my main reference.
B006QPVH6O|1.0|This has to be the worst movie in the past 50 years or longer.  It is slow to the point and extremely bouring.  The only good thing about it was the discription of the movie.  I will never trust another movie discription as long as I live thanks to this one it really deservse less than a one ratting.  The best they could come up with for aliens was spiders what a let down.  As soon as I saw that I was ready to turn it off but since I paid $6 to watch it I decided to get my agonizing moneys worth.  I realy couldn't wait for it to end.  This movie was such a disapointment that to mention anything good about it is a waist of time.

B0074EIQQU|4.0|The Mars Volta return with their sixth album titled Noctourniquet and it is definitely a strong yet streamlined version of what they have previously released. Produced by guitarist and songwriter Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, Noctourniquet contains shorter songs with less atmospheric interludes and a lot more emphasis on synth sounds. The vocals by Cedric Bixler-Zavala are melodic and intense as usual but the addition of new drummer Deantoni Parks is a slight step back from the virtuosity of Thomas Pridgen who made The Mars Volta the best progressive rock band on the planet for a while. Highlights include the epic build up of \\"Empty Vessels Make The Loudest Sound\\", the awesome atmosphere of \\"In Absentia\\", the intense groove of \\"Molochwalker\\", and the killer vocal hooks of \\"Zed And Two Naughts\\" which is a strong end to the album. Noctourniquet is definitely a better album than the underwhelming Octahedron (where Thomas Pridgen was kept on a leash for the most part) but doesn't really reach the amazing musical heights of their first four masterpiece works. Despite this slight shortfall, Noctourniquet is definitely a strong album for this version of The Mars Volta and will definitely please fans of this band and their style of progressive rock.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I will say this--The Hunger Games is a fast-paced novel that tells an engaging enough story. But that's part of the problem--it's *just* enough.<br /><br />It's far superior to the last YA book series sensation, Twilight: Hunger Games has a strong, independent heroine who actually fights and has some personality; while it has elements of romance, the story truly turns on survival; it makes a few motions towards larger political issues; and it is fairly competently written.<br /><br />With that said, what could have been an incredibly poignant situation--24 children forced to fight to the death--is reduced to an adrenaline rush, much like a real fight because hardly any of the contenders are fleshed out as characters. I found it hard to care about any of them except Rue, whose appeal is due to her young age. We get hints, but they're all cheap two-dimensional cartoons. Even Katniss and Peeta don't feel completely real at times. This is issue of quick-sketch writing plagues the entire book; it could easily have been twice as long without seeming overwrought if characters and cultural realities of the world were developed a bit more.<br /><br />This book is as lean as the characters. An entertaining read whose hints at depth turn out to be trompe l'oeil.
B0073PQ720|3.0|Frankly, I mistakenly assumed this was an American remake of a French movie that my wife and I enjoyed. Far from it! I found it gratuitously violent (and I am not opposed to violent films), with characters that were all basically unlikeable. Not enjoyable.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Excellent for Kindle Fire. Good value, as game plays for hours to solve unless you go straight to the hints. Use your brain, folks you shouldn't need too many hints.

B0073CNYWY|5.0|I'm sure I have nothing new to add that others have not said more eloquently before, but this entire series is a rare gem. I am of English descent so I can perhaps be forgiven that even the long shots of Highclerc Castle (Downton Abbey) thrill me to the core. The cast is absolutely outstanding and the direction and writing is (usually) excellent. The only cavil I have is that sometimes the writers \\"hand of god\\" is a little too visible in certain of the plots, making me want to say \\"will you leave these good people alone for a bit\\". Nonetheless, my wife and I both love it.

B005DD7H50|5.0|Very creative spin on a familiar story line. Unlock the potential of the human brain. What's creative you ask? Typically it is suggested that once the brain is working at full capacity, the subject has unlimited learning potential. As in, the subject can acquire large amounts of NEW information. What's new about Limitless is that the subject is able to unlock information already acquired through encounters and life experiences. Very cool.<br />This movie has a strong cast and is well acted. Very well done and great dialog. Highly recommend!

B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I loved the books as a kid, and I think the folks who made this movie shared that sentiment. They truly captured the characters and atmosphere of Herge's original works. Interestingly, my other half, who had never read any of the books, also loved the movie. We are eagerly anticipating the sequel(s).
B00005N6KG|5.0|I was wary because of the reviews stating that the sound can go out in any one earbud.  But for the price, I'm not too concerned - and will take the loss if it occurs.  However, the 40in long cable from earbuds to TRS plug/jack is my only criticism.  Just a little too short if you plan on wearing your music device in a low hanging pants pocket.<br /><br />Headphone is light, comfortable, and although lacking any real bass works fine for my needs.
0060558121|1.0|While I like the Shadow character and quite enjoyed the brief enounters with Sam, nothing ever happens in this book.  I need a plot, not random and nearly pointless vignettes of small towns similar to those I grew up in.  I decided to give it a chance to the halfway mark.  I don't get the Gaiman rave, I'll never pick up one of his books again.

B006JTS5OO|5.0|Last year, three major films paid tribute to beloved genres, all largely delighting their proponents and enlisting new audiences as to why they were great in the first place. One is the Oscar-winning Best Picture, \\"The Artist,\\" capturing Hollywood's golden age with no cynicism or irony, as seen through the eyes of young French filmmakers discovering the joys of classic moviedom; another is \\"Hugo,\\" an impassioned gateway to a master of celluloid magic, this time drawing the uninitiated into not-to-be-forgotten wonders through his discovery by young people.<br /><br />The third is \\"The Muppets,\\" the first Muppet project to fire on nearly every cylinder and recapturing the shameless lunacy of Jim Henson's iconic variety show-- once the most popular TV show in the world. Other attempts to bring back their spark have had their moments and should not be dismissed (believe it or not, one project that best captured it in recent years was \\"Elmo's Christmas Countdown\\" with Ben Stiller, which was as much in the spirit of \\"The Muppet Show\\" as \\"Sesame Street.\\")<br /><br />It took superfan Jason Segel's A-list clout to get the movie greenlit and Flight of the Conchords director James Bobin's encyclopediac passion for \\"The Muppet Show\\" to make it work. And in the tradition of the self-reflexive, we-know-we're-in-a-movie tradition of the Muppets, the plot is a surprisingly direct address at whether anybody still cares about Kermit, Miss Piggy and the gang.<br /><br />Even Disney, who owns the franchise and released the movie, isn't spared if you know the history: the villain's claim that he owns the names of our friends and they have no rights to them anymore is reminiscent of the attitude attributed to a Disney regime of the past. (But of course, in the words of Basil Fawlty, \\"We're all friends now!\\")<br /><br />Bobin was an inspired selection as director. Though \\"Flight of the Conchords\\" may not seem, at first, to be a cousin in comedy to The Muppet Show (and it's certainly not for children), but the wide-eyed naivete, the shameless absurdity and the earnestness of its main characters is very much in the same vein. \\"Conchords\\" star Bret McKenzie's Muppet songs are very much like sanitized versions of his comic tunes for the \\"Conchords\\" BBC Radio series and HBO TV show.<br /><br />McKenzie's \\"Man or Muppet\\" has made history as the first Oscar winner for the Muppets. Not \\"Rainbow Connection\\" nor \\"The First Time it Happens\\" won their statuettes -- there hasn't even been a special Oscar for Jim Henson. The song is funny and memorable but I really like \\"Life's a Happy Song\\" and Amy Adams' \\"Party of One.\\"<br /><br />Speaking of the radiant Ms. Adams, she has little to do in the film (as is the tradition in Muppet productions, after all) but she makes every moment shine. I can't help draw a parallel, this time to another loving tribute film in which she starred -- \\"Enchanted\\" -- which has a lot of similarities in tone and sincerity to The Muppets.<br /><br />The DVD/Blu-ray/movie & music download package, aka the \\"Wocka Wocka\\" edition, certainly offers a lot for the money. Once again, DVD owners will not get every feature as Blu-ray owners, which still seems not nice.<br /><br />One thing DVD owners do not get, besides a nicer-looking picture,is the entertaining audio commentary (thank you!) with Segel, Bobin and co-writer Nick Stoller. Segel constantly ribs the Disney folks in the studio with them by relentlessly cross-promoting in classic Disney synergy fashion, as well as remind us of almost every film in Adams' resume.<br /><br />One interesting Blu-ray feature is also quite curious: whenever the disc is paused, an \\"intermission\\" sequence pops on. Each time, it rests on a different point in a series of connecting gags. It's a nice idea-- but it also prevents the viewer from freezing a frame to catch a quick Muppety gag in the background (a funny sign, inside joke, etc.) So ironically, the DVD owner can freeze frames while the Blu-ray watcher cannot.<br /><br />Wocka wocka, indeed!annot.<br /><br />Wocka wocka, indeed!

B007BVOF8E|4.0|I really like this movie, although I preferred the 1979 BBC series as it was much truer to the book. The problem isn't the acting. It is first-rate. Unfortunately, so many other reviewers are right: too many shortcuts taken with the plot in order to condense it. Oldman, etal are all amazing, but if you are a fan of the book, it can hurt to watch how characters have been altered to fit modern movie sensibilities and a timeframe.<br /><br />This I think is the crux of the movie's problem. If you love the book, or the Guinness series, you will keep up with the condensed plot. However, the compromises may make you wince. If you have never partaken of either, then of course you will have a hard time keeping up and/or understanding. I admire the effort and the quality of acting and filming. It is superbly done. Gary Oldman does more just with his facial expressions than most actors can portray using their entire toolbox.<br /><br />I do, however, have no sympathy for folks who think James Bond is what a British spy drama should be all about. The British excel at character development. You either love British drama or you hate it. This is not a value judgment if you don't. However, please accept you may simply be out of your league passing judgment on a milieu you neither appreciate nor enjoy. The majority of movies made will appeal to you, so you should have little to complain about. For those that appreciate enjoyment for its own sake, as well as subtle craftsmanship, this movie will probably appeal to you. If you want something else, better to admit you don't get it rather than accuse this movie of being garbage. It is anything but. Sorry you got bored. The problem is not the movie.
B006FE83V8|5.0|This is simply the best of Gregory Peck by far. Liked Big Country, Omen, Guns of Navarone, The Yearling, Gentlemens Agreement etc etc.<br />The Bluray makeover is phenomenal.<br />Must have in anyones classic collection!
B007JRU2UK|3.0|This movie was so slow.  Even the scenery was lacking.  It speed up at the 1.25 hr mark, but not for long.
0440244412|4.0|I normally do not buy books unless I can see myself rereading them again. This book however I bought without reading. The last book, Dreamfever,leaves you on the edge of your seat flipping and searching unsuccessfully for more of the story because surely the book cannot end on that note. So when I saw Shadowfever on the shelf at the store I bought it and spent my weekend devouring it. I only had small moments of eye rolling but that was always when Dani came into play. I don't know why but that character really annoyed me and I found myself skimming through her parts as fast as I could to get back to Barrons. (>.&lt;) The last book to the series was jam packed with action and I found myself not being able to sleep at night because I had to read more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because it is a lot of fun and it is wonderful and nice and there is no vilince
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Me and my wife saw this in the theaters and we loved it. I am a real critic when it comes to movies, and agree with Rotten Tomatoes critic rating about 99% of the time. But this for me was a standout and I feel bad for Disney that they lost so much money on this. I strongly recommend this movie. It's a cross between Indiana Jones and a sci-fi. It's just good fun.
B000063DI8|3.0|I was a long time Maiden fan when this album came out, and to me it represented 2 things, first that they grew tired of the overblown production concept albums and wanted a return to the stripped down days of old, and second that things were strained among the band members, which resulted in Adrian Smith and eventually Bruce Dickinson leaving.  This album is in no way bad and contains a few great songs, but 2 decades later it still feels unfinished to me.  Still, if this is is the worst Maiden album as regarded by many to me it is still a strong 3 star record, which says not only a lot about this but a great deal about the strength of their catalog, truly one of the greatest bands ever.
B007N6NGYG|2.0|seems like a great game but after playing only a few levels I cant get back in. what's the deal?
B005YVTHT0|5.0|I bought it about a mouth ago, While at first i thought it was a bad purchase. The wheel felt too big and I couldn't use all the buttons while driving. But then after a couple of days i got used to it and now I'm in love.<br /><br />I have only tried it with Rfactor have yet to download Simraceway. All the buttons get recognized in the Rfactor and are able to be mapped to any function in the game. The shift lights and dials don't get recognized or work at all. There is a driver for the shift lights available but considering I spent almost all of my time looking at the screen instead of the wheel, i would probably turn them off if they even had worked.<br /><br />My final thoughts are that it was a good investment. Coming of a using an Xbox controller for driving games it gives a whole new feeling and challenge. I really believe it also helps with driving skills in real life. So down right to it its worth it
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan Boyle has a great voice.  This is a good collection of songs.  This is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys that style of music.
B000063DFN|5.0|I really don't know how anyone could rate this album below 4 stars and the fact that over 200 people have rated it 5 stars tells you all you need to know.  This album along with Live After Death changed my life and to me even stacked up against Piece of Mind and Number Of The Beast is Maiden's masterpiece, an absolutely groundbreaking album the set the bar for this type of heavy metal higher than it ever had been before.  Few bands have ever realized an album start to finish and this one that holds up just as well almost 30 years later.  There was no way to top this one, it was their peak and a peak that set new standards for greatness.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This game is really great...for about the first two minutes of anytime you open it. Unfortunately, it freezes up WAY too often. Please fix for a better rating. Samsung Nexus
B003L77GG0|5.0|A highly recommended item, awesome quality and the a really interesting argument. The only think I don't like so much was Darkside, besides that it was worth making the purchase.
0439023521|3.0|Let me begin by saying that Hunger Games is a commercial success by every standard of measure. In that sense, the author deserves full credit.  However, if I were to critically evaluate it, I'd say the book should come with something of a warning to the general public.  Hunger Games has a mixed genre and seems unsure whether it wants to be a romance novel or a serious work of science fiction.  The result is less than optimal.<br /><br />Collins does a superb job of writing in first person, which is not an easy thing to do. This gives the book a great pace that keeps the pages flipping.  The story itself is somewhat contrived but it still entertains. I won't add spoilers, but let's just say Hunger Games is something like a blend between Brave New World and the typical romance novel. Starting out, the book is more sci-fi than romance novel but Collins doesn't seem to be able to resist the itch for long. Soon you're treated to pages of those knowing moments where one glance into his eyes lasts an eternity and it takes a paragraph just to describe a kiss. Of course, you also get the typical love triangle schlock where Katniss is tormented trying to decide which man she really loves.<br /><br />The main character, Katniss, is very interesting (despite her bizarre, silly name) and it's fun watching her plotting and calculating her way through the games.  Her boyfriend may be wimpy, but Katniss is still interesting to track.  Sure there are plenty of girly moments, lots of descriptions of dresses, hairdos, and make-up, but then you're back to the action sequences which are entertaining and keep the story moving.<br /><br />In the end, I admire Collins talent to sell an astronomical number books but still I'm left wanting.  Had she leaned harder to the sci-fi side the book would have had had an enduring legacy.  Instead she'll score with then teen females while leaving the broader audience waiting something else.  Hunger Games is readable but I don't think it will last thetest of time.

0439023521|5.0|Everyone I know seems to have read or be reading this book series.  Mind you, none of us are in our teens!  ;)  My hubby was passed along the first book to read on a plane ride.  Normally, he doesn't get too interested in books in general since he's more of a video/movie guy.  So when he got hooked, I knew I had to give it a try!  It took me a while to get connected to the characters and storyline.  The main reason being that I'm not really into post apocalyptic, sci-fi reading or excessive violence.  I normally love historical fiction.  That being said, once I got into the storyline, I read the entire trilogy in 2 days.  It had enough of the \\"real world\\" in it to ground the book and make it interesting to me, with lots of unexpected twists in some parts.  It is not as predictable as you think it's going to be.  The first book can stand on its own, but it's definitely better read as a trilogy.  While the second book is not as strong as the first, it has good parts (my favorite is the development of Katniss and Peeta's bond) and leaves you with such a big cliffhanger that it's pretty much impossible not to immediately want to start reading the third book.  The third book is definitely more dark than the first two with heavy sad parts, etc.  I like that this book really focuses more on Gale to develop his character.  By now, most of us are attached to Peeta since we don't know Gale as well.  Even though this final book is sad in many ways, it is a more realistic approach to what life (and character's personalities) would be like after being exposed to so many different life changing hardships.  So if it would have ended differently, I would have been very upset!  It doesn't sugarcoat things or have a sticky sweet fairy tale ending, but that wouldn't have matched up with the whole theme of the books.  Overall, even though it's not normally my thing, it's an addictive series and I'm glad I read it!  I'm sort of glad it ended because those fictional characters went through so much, it would have been depressing to drag it out longer!  Great series!  Read it!
B006Q6MOCY|5.0|Agree with the other 2 reviews (to date) that this is easily the best sounding version of Pet Sounds. Sound is fuller, lusher, more relaxed, more present. Great great job by MFSL on this Pet Sounds digital remaster. Nice packaging as well, with CD inner sleeve.
B00000F566|3.0|Don't be fooled - this version does not have the additional scenes that have been showing when this movie plays on TV.  That's the main reason why I ordered the movie, but I'm disappointed.  Also, the color is dark, not bright and crisp like others have said.  Oh, well.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Martin's ongoing epic is on a breathtaking scale, spanning all<br />continents of the planet, with large feudal kingdoms in their<br />medieval splendor and wretchedness, a Hun-like civilization of<br />fearsome mounted warriors, oriental potentates and merchants,<br />and slaves, serfs, prostitutes, eunuchs, businessmen, knights<br />and princesses, brigands and cutthroats, priests and craftsmen,<br />and every type and avocation one can imagine.<br />But it also features dragons and dragon riders, sorcerers,<br />mysterious and deadly creatures from the far north, and gorgeous<br />creations such as the Wall, an ice barrier on a monstrous scale<br />(thousands of feet tall, tens of miles long) to keep those deadly<br />creatures in the northern waste.<br /><br />How could a made-for-TV movie series possibly do justice to this<br />setting? Lord of the Rings would have been easier!  Moreover, many<br />of the leading characters are very complex and even the simpler ones,<br />including those fated to die in various painful ways at regular<br />intervals (the epic is also remarkably brutal and in-your-face<br />about its brutality), are fully 3-dimensional.  The books are<br />rich in settings, in events, in human interactions, and in carnage.<br /><br />And, behold! This series does it all.  The settings are drop-dead<br />gorgeous, the brutality is everpresent and very realistic (lots of<br />blood, lots of corpses, but nothing theatrical about it all), the<br />entire year, by following only the first volume of the series (currently<br />about one-sixth of the published opus, with more books coming), is<br />very faithful to the book, and the actors and actresses are simply<br />first-rate.  Tyrion, the dwarf, steals the show, but Circe, the<br />\\"evil queen\\", is, if anything, even better in the movie than in the<br />text -- a spectacular performance.  The mad last male \\"dragon\\" (son<br />of the line of the dragon riders/masters) is beautifully and convincingly<br />mad; his sister is growing before our eyes from a timid, even fearful<br />girl, into a very regal queen; and Sean Bean is, well, Sean Bean -- heavier<br />than when cast as Boromir in LotR, more ponderous in his approach,<br />and capturing the screen at every appearance.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the compilation of the second season/second volume<br />-- it has just started, so it will be a year before we get it.  In the<br />meantime, though, I will watch this one many times, through every<br />episode -- it's glorious!<br /><br />If there is one slight weakness, it is the score.<br />The theme is martial and rather ominous, which fits, but most episodes<br />feature relatively little music -- better that than the kind of bad<br />music one gets all too often in movies, of course, but after LotR showed<br />that one could have superb music perfectly married to an action/fantasy<br />movie, I was hoping that all future moviemakers would attempt to emulate<br />(not equal -- that would be too much to hope for) LotR in this respect.<br /><br />The BD is of high quality, comparable to most theatrical releases,<br />although not at the level of the BD Extended Edition of LotR (but then,<br />what is?).<br />The sound is \\"only\\" 5.1 -- it would have been better in 7.1, especially<br />as we get a number of emotionally draining scenes that would be even<br />stronger if one were truly surrounded by sound.  (And here the BD is an<br />issue, since a full HDMI path from disk to sound and video means that one<br />cannot enhance the 5.1 to 7.1.)<br /><br />Overall, though, the sound issue is a rather minor complaint.  This may<br />be a made-for-TV movie series, but it is a masterpiece, one that compares<br />well even to the standard-setting LotR.  Get it, you'll be watching it over<br />and over.

The changes in the storyline in the movie are at best STUPID.There is NO character development in the movie. There are scenes in the movie that don't take place until Book 2. The mystery that is what happened to Harriot Vanger is totally diffrent than depicted in the book and is not believable. They are two diffrent stories. Talk to someone who has read the book and seen the movie before investing in the movie. You Have been warned. There are people writing positive reviews on this site that don't want you to know the movie does NOT follow the book. Major dissapointment.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|surprisingly it was really good, and i loved every level, all 100. can't wait for more. seriously entertaining for someone like myself who likes little puzzles
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved the second season and having the DVD with all the extras was so great.  Best part was using the subtitles---realized that there were things I missed at the first viewing on PBS.  This will keep me going until the 3rd season airs.  More Downton Abbey, please!!!!!!
B004J4WKTW|2.0|There are way too many characters in this book and we never really get to know any of them. The descriptions of the circus tents are nice, but there is way too much of that and hardly any plot. Don't buy this unless you like reading long descriptions of things and enjoy a slow moving story that never really makes sense.

0060873027|3.0|I've enjoyed Michael Crichton's books since reading \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" upon its initial release.  (I met Crichton briefly at a signing for his book \\"Next\\" and had him sign my old copy of \\"Andromeda Strain\\" as well.)  \\"Micro\\" was started by Crichton and completed by Richard Preston upon Crichton's untimely demise.  I'm not sure how much either writer wrote, I could not tell the difference in the writing.  It is sad that \\"Micro\\" was the last book started by Crichton before his premature demise, it is not a particularly great and, at times, a rather silly book.<br />Basically a group of graduate students discover a conspiracy within  a company doing work for the military and are shrunk down to microscopic size by the crazed boss of the company.  They are then transported to a rainforest area in Hawaii and have to fight for survival while trying to get back to the company and the machine to grow them to normal size.  Each of the students just happens to have a specialty that helps them to survive: one is an expert in insects, another in beetles, another in various venoms, etc.  They have no great problems creating weaponry: blowguns, spears, machetes, poisons, etc.<br />There are some very scary and suspenseful moments such as various students being swallowed by insects and surviving!!!  Many of the students come to untimely ends before the satisfying conclusion and the loathesome boss of the company getting his just desserts (sort of what the evil executive got at the conclusion of \\"Timeline,\\" one of Crichton's better books.)<br />In conclusion, \\"Micro\\" is okay but it is sad that this is the book that the author of \\"Andromeda Strain,\\" \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"Rising Sun\\" and \\"The Great Train Robbery\\" had to go out on.

B00756GKBA|5.0|I admit that upon a first hearing, I loathed it. I despised it. I felt betrayed by my own beleaguered senses, as if I, a missing person missing out, had indeed gone astray the boundaries of propriety.  None too thrilled, I wondered, What has this old reliable icon of revampability done to herself, catering to the outliers and the incomprehensible?  But then, after a few more listens, because, after all, this is the in-your-face queen of pop, something courageously uptempoed and brave began to grow until the collective mess of it earwormed into my brain, leaving glittery remains of resistance in its wake...till I wound up being enthralled by MDNA's utter grasp on the art of artistry!  Damn, I get it, even as it gets me!  And I'm still not winding down! Pared to a creative acronym (MDNA), she's not shortsighted, but long on pushing those clever levers! Desperately seeking the irrelevance embodied therein so I could feel smug about her decline, I found instead that her latest foray resonates with worth and meaning, depth and feeling...and yes, its metronomic qualities, replete with fidgety exuberance and gadabout gladness, are quite in sync with the dance floor of seismic delights.  MDNA is ecstacy, but the good kind, whose tonal pharmacology won't kick in right away.  But be forewarned: when it does, it can stun you with its clarity, backbite, and sheer craftsmanship. A brilliant admix of old and new Madonna to L U V...and yeah, I wanna!

B007JRU2UK|4.0|I am giving this movie four stars.  I do not usually like these kleenex clutchers films but this one did engage me. I say this because if I do not like a film I find myself pausing it to take a break. If the film is really bad I can get lots of housework done! For the most part I enjoyed the story.  However, I felt that the script should have given us more information about Elizabeth.  My impression of this character is still negative.  I never found a reason to sympathize with her.  Her friends and family cared about her but I never was sure why. On the other hand I did get to know her husband.  I was drawn into their story. The film score is outstanding using great Hawaiian music. Another reason to give this film a four.
B005LAII0I|4.0|On Wednesday night (3/28), my son and I attended an advance screening of Mirror Mirror, the movie that gives a new take on the story of Snow White.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to seeing Mirror Mirror.  I had seen the ads for the movie and it looked like it was going to be very funny.  I had also run a giveaway on my blog for the Soundtrack to Mirror Mirror so I knew that the music was going to be great.  And I loved the over-the-top clothing in the movie so much that I even did a Mirror Mirror Pinterest board. So I was expecting to have great time and overall my son and I liked the movie.<br /><br />Mirror Mirror is told from the perspective of the Evil Queen (played by Julia Roberts).  When the movie opens, the Evil Queen is fully in power and has drained the poor villagers dry of all their money to support her lavish lifestyle of over the top gowns and parties. Her parties are so crazy that she even plays a game of chess with human chess pieces.<br /><br />Snow White (played by Lilly Collins) has pretty much been locked in her room for the past ten years after her father, the King, disappeared in the forest. The Evil Queen has been controlling poor Snow White by putting her down every chance she can get - and boy oh boy does the Evil Queen do a great job of bullying Snow White. Some of her comments to Snow White are brutal.<br /><br />On Snow White's 18th birthday, she finally gets the courage to leave the castle and visit the village and she finds that all the once happy people are now dirt poor. But she lacks the confidence to do anything about it. By chance she rescues Prince Alcott, the handsome prince who is passing through the land and has been robbed by the Seven Dwarfs. Yes, you read that correctly. In this version of the Snow White story, the Seven Dwarfs are thieves who live in the forest. At one time, they worked respectable jobs in the village, but the Evil Queen had them banished because of their appearance.<br /><br />The Queen wants to marry Prince Alcott for his money.  But, Prince Alcott is completely taken with Snow White. So taken in fact that the Queen wants her dead.  The story unfolds from there as Snow White finally ends up getting the courage to fight back.<br /><br />Julie Roberts is the star of this movie and she is fabulous as the Evil Queen.  She has the best clothes and the best one liners that you will ever hear. There is a scene where she has a \\"beauty treatment\\" that is totally beyond words. And she is so evil that you will have to look twice to remember that this role is being played by the actress who is the sweetheart of Hollywood.  The way Julia played the Evil Queen reminded me a lot of how Meryl Streep played Miranda Priestly in the movie The Devil Wears Prada. Adults will love the Evil Queen and kids will be scared to death.  My son actually flinched in his seat a few times.<br /><br />Another great role in Mirror Mirror is Nathan Lane as Brighton, the Evil Queen's butler.  He was just a riot and he had some of the funniest one liners in the whole movie.<br /><br />Lilly Collins as Snow White was all goodness and sweetest and kids will love her. But she and Prince Alcott (played by Armie Hammer) were upstaged for most of the movie by Julia Roberts as the Evil Queen. I loved their characters at the beginning and the end, but I think they were overpowered by all the fancy clothing (or in Prince Alcott's case - lack of clothing) for most of the movie.  Arnie Hammer had to take off his shirt so many times that I was wondering if this was a kids movie.  And Lilly Collins looked great, but she really needed a few more sword fighting lessons.<br /><br />The Seven Dwarfs were great and a few of them were so funny that everyone in the audience was laughing out aloud.<br /><br />The end of Mirror Mirror is wonderful and exciting. Good vs Evil is always thrilling and this movie has some great fight scenes. My son was so into the physical comedy and sword fights that I could hardly keephim in his seat. But despite all the clothing, and sword fighting and evilness, the middle of this movie is a tad boring - hate to say it.<br /><br />Overall Mirror Mirror is a visually appealing movie that both kids and parents will enjoy.  It was fun and outrageous. It was sweet and cute. And it was evil and exciting. It was also a little bit boring, But the end is definitely worth the entire movie. And mark my words, you will be singing the movie soundtrack song \\"I Believe in Love\\" on your way to your car.<br /><br />Mirror Mirror opened in theaters Friday March 30th and is rated PG.him in his seat.

B005LRWRZ8|3.0|Rarely can artist ever touch their greatest work, which IMO would be from &#34;Killing Is My Business...and Business Is Good!&#34; to &#34;Cryptic Writings&#34;, but Mustaine came close a couple of times with &#34;The System Has Failed, &#34;United Abominations&#34; and &#34;Endgame&#34; (My personal Favorite out of the Three). When it comes to there recent release, I just don't get that dark feeling we Megadeth fans love. &#34;TH1RT3EN&#34; has a great concept, using songs from different time periods to create the album, but none of these songs capture thier past as the ravaging thrash monster.<br /><br />Mustains lyrics have always moved my mind but this album he takes a very old school approach, and some would say to be a little corny. It's similar to the way Motorhead writes lyrics, very blunt and almost without rhythm. Musically I thought he could do so much better. I mean if you put these riffs next to the riffs and solos from &#34;Endgame&#34;, there is no comparison. The best song lyrically and musically is &#34;13&#34;, which Mustaine beautifully says, &#34;Thirteen times I went to the well to draw my thoughts, I'll gather and tell.&#34; This song was definitely NOT one of the re-visited ones and you can totally hear the difference. This album was basically the greatest fillers that didn't make the final cut. It was a good effort but I expected so much more from the metal god, Mustaine!<br /><br />Favorite Moments:<br /><br />1) 13 - Best song on album<br />2) Guns, Drugs, and Money - Heavy and interesting.<br />3) Black Swan - Good intro, singing and dark lyrics<br />4) Whose Life (Is It Anyway?) - Good intro, heavy and punky but lyrics sound a little corny at times

B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Gill Pender (Owen Wilson) is a Hollywood screenwriter who has written his first novel. He and his finacee (Rachel McAdams) are visiting her parents in Paris, and while she is interested in catching up with old friends in the city, he is taken by the beauty of Paris in the rain, and Paris at night. He laments the past and is enchanted by stories of the 1920s when the biggest celebrities spent their time in Paris nightclubs. One night, after lots of drinking, Gill goes for a walk, and a vintage automobile picks him up and transports him back in time where he rubs elbows with the most elite figures of the time, from the Fitzgeralds to Hemingway to Gertrude Stein to Dali and Picasso.<br /><br />This movie has the easy sentimentality of many Woody Allen movies. One gets the impression that he writes for himself above anyone else, and that is okay because many can identify with his passions. This movie glamorizes Paris the way other Allen movies glamorize New York and it has the same winsome quality of The Purple Rose of Cairo. There is a moral, and it is spelled out quite clearly, but although this movie has the same format of most stories, it flows calmly like a lazy river. Enjoy the ride.
B005Z271Y6|3.0|This is a great concert by Adele. No one can sing like she can and she sings all her top songs. The problem is the director does not let us enjoy it. He continually jumps from camera to camera, every few seconds. I buy a DVD because it gives you a front row seat, but not here. You will find yourself watching the concert from all over the arena, including lots of views of her backside, from the side and every instrumentalist au nausea. Its as if the director thinks we will forget where the concert is if he doesn't continually show the concert hall from every imaginable direction. A lot of out of focus shots. I would suggest you buy the cd or listen to the DVD with the television picture off. We buy the concert to see what the audience sees. The audience got to see more of Adele than we did. What a shame.

B0041C09Y0|5.0|I was instantly hooked to this series and can't wait for Season 4 to become Prime Eligible. The main character, Charlie Hunnam, is visually appealing. There are times when he does some \\"bad\\" things, but I still love his character. Anyway, the show is amazing and I can't get enough of it. The characters always have me at the edge of my seat longing for more.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Once you get past the first few levels you start getting weird tiles where it's hard to tell what goes with what. It might not be a problem on a larger screen but on the smaller screen it gives me a headache.
0006486118|3.0|Look, yes, the book was long. I actually re-read the first four books before reading this one, so it was a big chunk of reading. Yes, lots didn't happen during it; there were slow interludes. But some stuff does and so I was okay with the book until the ending.<br /><br />So as not to give away spoilers - it felt like Martin had no idea what to do next to get his characters moving forward, so he shook the snow globe up or if you prefer knocked over the game table. And he didn't do it cleverly. He just said \\"hmmm, no idea where to go so let's just abruptly do a bunch of things to disrupt stuff.\\"<br /><br />Really wondering about the characters we've come to know and in many cases admire against our will. Will there be a whole new set next book?<br /><br />And by the way - very tired of the way Cersei is being portrayed. She's written as a dumb blond, prey to her emotions, sluttish, power grabbing, whatever. Yet somehow she keeps ending up winning, more or less. I think he should portray her as a lot more clever than he does and stop heaping so much scorn on her.<br /><br />Anyway, I really thought this was going to be the last book when I got it. But guess not. Will I read the next one? probably, assuming I'm not dead by the time it comes out or that I haven't totally forgotten about the series (it took seeing previews of the TV show to remind me of the book series and finally got me to check to see if there was a new one out).
B000002B5L|5.0|Wyclef, Lauren and Pras deliver on this classic album. Catchy from start to finish. This one is a true gem. Newt Gingrich does suck ****!
B007FH9GT2|4.0|This movie keeps you engaged while purposefully unfolding the mysteries.  Slowly folding back piece by piece who is doing what, who knows what, and then allowing you to build conclusions you will later deem correct or off the mark.<br /><br />As the movie starts there are 2 different story lines and it swaps between them, you follow Mikael for a bit to learn about his life, and see where he is going.  Then the scenes change back to Lisbeth and you learn about her and her life.  Both of the main lines carry on for a bit with only glimpses as to how they might merge.  As the stories come together, the magic of the movie comes to life, you really see the energy, the passion and the on screen chemistry unfold.<br /><br />Be warned this is a dark movie, rape scenes, murder and other dark topics are covered.  As to be expected the movie is filmed in an overcase grey way to add to the feeling of darkness.  Cold and dark, mysterious, fast paced scene changes as events build and the tone accelerates through the movie.<br /><br />The movie is unable to fill in many of the details the book includes.  It takes paying attention and often the words are covered with music or other audio making it hard to understand.  I needed to use my 10 second replay feature many times to make sure I understood exactly what was just said.  The understanding of some characters and their role in Lisbeth's life leads to some wondering as she becomes known to the audience, these are topics filled in with greater detail in the book, with the movie you must infer things.<br /><br />4 stars for a very well done movie, it keeps your attention and is entertaining.  not 5 stars because the violence and nudity were beyond what I felt was R, this is heavy R even erotic in many scenes.
B002PDGTI2|5.0|Rather you've danced to Madonna since the early 1980's or are a young new fan, you will love this collection that covers her hits through this century.  Although I had never purchased any of Madonna's albums in the past, I was surprised to know that my 16 and 18 year old daughters recognized many of the songs and wanted to add the album to their iPods.  I highly recommend this album to dance music lovers.

0385334176|4.0|IMPORTANT NOTE:It is primitive that you read \\"Breakfast Of Champions\\" before tackling \\"Deadeye Dick\\". The reason being is that you will get the story details a little more, and previous characters of \\"BOC\\" also are in this story, which takes place in Midland City, Ohio as well. We have Dwayne Hoover(used car salesman),Celia Hoover(Drano woman and wife/ex of Dwayne), Bunny Hoover(homosexual son of Dwayne and Celia and a piano player at the Holiday Inn. Fred T.Berry as well and even Karabekian is mentioned. And Hitler.<br /><br />So who is \\"Deadeye Dick?\\", well his name is Rudy Waltz and he got his nickname from being on the roof of his house with a gun that accidentally went off. Said bullet traveled 3 miles and hit an innocent woman in her house while she was vacuum cleaning. And she was pregnant as well. This incident happened at a young age for Rudy and has spent the rest of his life as a depressed sad asexual man of guilt. His only one thing of achievement was a play he wrote called 'Katmandu', which played for one night in New York to horrible reviews. His one and only achievement in life which also leads to his downfall.<br />We also hear about his past and his relationship with his father and Arthur Gunther, his muse.<br /><br />This book is about people, plain and simple people living in the boring town of Midland City, (or in any small town in America),and how they each mesh with each other in different ways that lead them to different stations in life.<br />Similar in his works such as \\"Breakfast Of Champions\\", \\"Bluebeard\\" and \\"God Bless You, Mr.Rosewater\\". I have now read every title by Mr.Vonnegut and \\"Deadeye Dick\\" did not disappoint and left me with the same feeling as his older classics. Oh how I miss him, but every time you read one of his books, he's with you all the time.<br /><br />\\"Deadeye Dicks\\" peephole was opened in 1982 and hasn't closed yet or ever will.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game. ive had no trouble using it whatsoever at all. I would really recommend downloading this for kids!
B006P3HXZG|2.0|Let me preface this by saying I really like movies regardless of genre'.  I am a big fan of animated and 3D movies (if a movie is both - that's a bonus).  That all having been said I thought that this movie fell flat from the very beginning (I liked the first couple of Shrek films).  If I weren't multi-tasking when this was on I would have played something else instead.  I thought the movie was way too superficial and non-engaging for adult audiences.  I hope the grandkids like it.  The only real redeeming quality it has is that it's 3D, but that alone won't get me to watch it again.
B004NELBPC|4.0|This app is mostly well done but it does have a few problems that are more annoying than anything else.  First, the home page will auto rotate for a nice wide view, but when you go into an article, it will only display portrait, no rotation whatsoever.  Seems like an easily fixed problem, but I'm not a programmer.  Also, many times, an article will say \\"see video above\\" but what is a video on the full site is nothing more than a picture on the mobile app.  I understand the need to simplify for mobile, but I feel like the pic should at least link to the video in the article and allow playing with YouTube app or whatever.  Really these are the only two issues I have with this app.  It's not a data hog and it gives me the Huffington Post right at my fingertips wherever I go, which is very nice! But compared to other news apps, it leaves something to be desired.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|I'm often wary of sequels (especially if the sequel is serially number 3 or higher) but this is a worthy addition to the family video collection (I'd own it even if I didn't have grandkids).  It's a fun plot line with a good moral lesson and 3D makes it just that much more fun.  A definite crowd-pleaser where the kids are concerned.  My grandkids (ages 3 to 8) ask to see it over-and-over again.  They're happy to watch it in plain Blu-ray instead of 3D, but 3D makes it a special treat.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I never leave reviews.<br /><br />This book was that amazing and worth expressing it so here.  I'm not a fan of short stories, I loathed them in college because I felt they were just never enough and that's what I initially thought when I started reading.  The first Wool is a short no doubt, but it was the perfect way to lead into this heart pounding, breath-holding, suspense-filled (and you-fill-in-the-rest) story.  This story grabs you and doesn't let go. I look forward to more stories of the silos!
B00722ZIBA|5.0|well how do i start? first let me say i am a long time Incognito fan,,have all thier music.. on my very 1st listen when i bought this on tuesday i was not impressed at all..then two days later I AM HOOKED!!!!  Bluey i dont know how u do it with consisstantly making hit song after hit song.. On my very 1st listen i only liked track 11...but now can hardly get past the 1st song without repeating them. Bluey i hope u didnt cut a deal with the devil to keep up with making beautiful music like this. if i had to critique one thing on this Cd it would be that there were no slow tempo jams on it but i end up taking it back because u guys get the message \\"love\\" across so well that a \\"slow Jam\\" wasnt really needed. i ended up buying two Surreal Cds lasst tuesday and i was a lil pissed that Best Buy didnt have it in stock so i ended up buying them from FYE and payed 15 bucks apiece for them..i was used to paying only 9.99 for a new Cd when its purchased within two weeks of when the Cd first comes out.. but now when i think of it,with how this Cd makes me feel had i bought it for 50 bucks i would feel like i got a steal!
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Graphics are great. Biggest flawed are lack of location, even cell phone tower approximate location. Works ok for checking specific paves, like when planning a trip or just checking for your home town.  Equally problematic for Android is the lack of an actual home screen widget... Who is really going to open thus up just to check the weather when there are sufficiently visual weather apps (beautiful widgets) that fit on your home screen.  I'll keep our in hopes a future update will correct, but I would not purchase.
1451627289|3.0|I love a good time travel yarn and since there are so few, I looked forward to King's story.  I was disappointed, but probably shouldn't have been.<br /><br />Stephen King has certain hallmarks, that when it works (Green Mile, much of his early work AFTER Carrie) it really works, and when it doesn't (most of his last half dozen books), falls flat, and when it's twisted (everything from Needful Things to IT which should never have been published).  King gets Americana, though, so I thought this would be fantastic work.  But my own viewpoints worked against me, so it isn't really fair to drag this down.  I don't believe Oswald worked alone, I do think he was a patsy.  I'm nothing if not flexible, though, so I gave it chance.<br /><br />King's fatal flaw has always been his editor's unwillingness to edit him sufficiently.  Cut half of this out and it would be better.  King works his white-magic, gee-gaws in the gaps of the universe, poorly this time.  I love the concepts of the past working against him, but as his only real antagonist, it wasn't personal enough.  Unlike others, I enjoyed the small town, high school teacher/director bits.  I loved Mimi, who was believable; Deke, who just wasn't fleshed out well enough, and I wanted to love Sadie, but she wasn't 60's enough (I lived in the 60's and women that broken didn't behave that way, nor was EVERYONE a smoker).  She felt like someone plucked out of the 2000's.<br /><br />And I simply didn't believe that he wouldn't just take out Oswald sooner.  The moment he was revealed as a wife-beater, that should have been enough.<br /><br />Finally, I felt cheated (SPOILER ALERT) by the end.  The Past as adversary and the breakdown of reality just didn't wash.  I wanted a glimpse of a world with a JFK driven by choices, not reality crumbling events.<br /><br />Nonetheless, King has a wonderful narrative voice, even if Jake wasn't a memorable character. Bits of it soared, other bits didn't.  I do trust King as a story-teller, though, so I could see it through and still be glad I read it.
0307592731|5.0|What a beautifully written book.  I was a little disappointed when I learned this was not a fiction book but the Authors 1st book was so good I read it anyway.  I am so glad I did.  This book was a great story about a life full of challenges.  About how despair can make a person do things they never thought they could/would and how to pick up the pieces of bad choices and move on. Some of the lines near the end of the book were very inspirational.  Like when she wrote about finding the way out but really wanting to find the way in.  Also the details of the nature she got to witness first hand on the trail were just great.  A really good book.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is fun and never ending .  the best is being able to play with friends and helping them out with gifts and tips
B000000XB9|5.0|Purchasd this after hearing a CCR song played on a jukebox in a TV show.  I forgot how much I really love this music, for listening and dancing.  It seems like many more songs than twenty, and everyone deeply satisfying and remembered in my cells.  I'm happy to be reclaiming the Southern Rock.  It really is good.  Bought a recent John Fogerty album of western music, it's good too!  Every song on this Greatest Hits album is a hit, and listening after is a delightful new discovery, again!  A must have for every music library.  I could have used a remastering with more dynamic range, but the enjoyment of the music makes that a secondary matter.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I rented this movie on my Kindle Fire. As soon as it ended I told myself \\"I have GOT to watch it again!\\" Now I'm going to purchase it. Denzel is awesome.
B001UAX56A|5.0|I have enjoyed the music by Lauryn Hill the entirety of my youth, and to finally purchase the music and have it available to play whenever I like on my computer is the best. Music is a great investment in my opinion. This CD has brilliant music.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was the best book I ever read! I read it before the movie came out and I'm glad I did. The movie was also really good but the book is definitely better. Be sure to read Catching Fire and Mockingjay too. The entire series is amazing!!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I don't like how quickly the computer makes its moves and there's no instructions or rules.  But it's a good way to practice and keep up your skills.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I used to love adventure games on the PC and this is the first I've played on a mobile platform.<br /><br />The graphics and game play were well done. The writing was poor but that's fine, it's not story driven, but puzzle/atmosphere based.<br /><br />I took one star off because I believe you can get stuck and need to reset the game. If you used the rope on the well before you use it on the cliff you can't get it back to descend the cliff. Woops.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|Excellent game.my wife and I played this together and thoroughly enjoyed it. Now I'm off to look for more games like this from the dev
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|Not bad, good effects, etc., but who cares? The original was the best. Why is Hollywood playing it safe by only re-doing the classics? Where are the new ideas?
B004IFYMWK|1.0|Overall, this is a good film. The combination of news footage with the events in the lives of the characters was well-balanced, and I do not see the acting as \\"wooden\\" as described by other reviewers.<br /><br />However, it is clear that the film has little to do with real world events and more to do with how Sean Penn truly relates with the world, i.e., from a lofty perch where he makes presumptuous and pompous decrees and judgments. Halfway through the film, when the Plames begin having marital problems and the plot moved closer to an accurate portrayal of the actual historical events, I had hope that the film would end on this high note. However, we are only left with another slump into the realm of Penn's perception of reality.<br /><br />I do not know how much influence Mr. Penn had in the making of this movie, but I do see why he would agree to have a starring role since the plot fits his \\"world.\\"
0439023513|4.0|I read this whole trilogy as if it was one book--just like other readers have said--I couldn't put it down as I HAD to know what happened to the characters.<br /><br />I disagree with many criticisms of this last book.  What happened to the characters was nothing unexpected. **SPOILERS** Katniss' mental breakdowns, Gale's anger and how it changes him, Peeta's torture.  That is part of the point of the books.  The effects of trauma and war. They just don't go away but are always a part of who you are.  Even what happened to Prim.  Just because Katniss saved her by volunteering for the games, didn't save her in the end.  Although I do think that Prim's death was mostly a mechanism to solve Katniss' love triangle.<br /><br />And the ending.  How can anyone disagree with the ending?!  People wanted more of a happy ending?  I thought, that given the horrors of the stories, that it was a pretty darn happy ending.  Katniss and Peeta helping eachother back to life slowly in District 12.  I'm sure, in the end, it was more than they dreamed of.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I am on the 4th book in the series and really enjoyed the 1st season of this series. The writing and actors are awesome.
1439192812|5.0|I picked up this book with the hope that it would be good bedtime reading with my 3-yr-old and 5-yr-old. They enjoy reading books about space and other aspects of science, so I thought that this one might be a good one to add to the rotation. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit that bill, because there's a lot more information here than my little ones will be able to enjoy and process.<br /><br />I'm still really glad I bought it and read it, though, because it's a gorgeous and interesting book that will be great for them in about five years.<br /><br />Dawkins covers a dozen general topics of science (\\"Who is the first person\\", \\"What is the sun?\\"), starting almost every chapter with ancient myths regarding the topic and then diving into the real science of the matter. His explanations are in clear, understandable language.<br /><br />It's interesting to see when Dawkins the evolutionary biologist is in territory he understands well (\\"Why are there so many different kinds of animals?\\") compared with topics in which he's admittedly not an expert (some of the physics of \\"What is a rainbow?\\"). When he's not an expert on a topic, he lets us know up front what the limit of his understanding is, which is charming at times, and also gives the book a personal, familiar tone.<br /><br />The illustrations throughout are fantastic, and they really illuminate the related text content throughout. I'm happy just to turn page after page looking at the brightly colorful pictures.<br /><br />I can see why some Christians have objected to this book - some of the mythological explanations used in the beginning of chapters come from the Bible. For Dawkins, this makes sense, as he considers Judeo-Christian stories as no more grounded in reality than any mythology. There will definitely be many who read his reluctance to give Christianity special treatment as a targeted attack, but I personally think he's correct when he treats Christian stories equally with other stories.<br /><br />Additionally, the final chapter, \\"What is a miracle?\\" will be seen by many as an attack on religion. That might be Dawkins' intent, but it's more clear that he's trying to prove his overall point, that the wonder of the real world is more impressive than either stage magic or supernatural stories.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great general introduction to the wonders of science for preteens to adults.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Great app for kindle fire. Updates you instantly when there are new emails. Smooth transitions and easy to use. Can also read html emails.
B003UESJH4|3.0|First off, I'd give this movie 3.5 Stars as opposed to 3.<br /><br />Secondly I think that, when you win Best Picture, it must be extraordinary and 'The King's Speech' isn't quite extraordinary.  It is very good and Firth, Carter and Geoffrey Rush are outstanding.  Bravo to all of you chaps.<br /><br />Firth becomes King George VI and stammers when he speaks (unless he's using numerous four letter words in succession in an elevated voice...which I highly recommend whether you stammer or not).  He befriends an unlicensed speech therapist and the adventure begins.<br /><br />I think this movie shares a lot of the same qualities 'The Karate Kid' had, although there are no Asian people or high school hooligans threatening to beat up the Duke of York.<br /><br />The methods in which Rush begins to teach his young pupil seem to come from a strange, mysterious world, but they're very effective.  Rolling around on the early 20th Century rugs aren't much different then painting the old wooden fence in the backyard.  Not smoking cigarettes during sessions is a lot like wax on - wax off.  of course, the techniques aren't as important as the results...and this bizarre companionship blossoms into something much more:  eternal friendship and admiration.<br /><br />It is a beautiful thing when the most important element of human nature is captured on screen, and 'The King's Speech' captures it and even exceeds it to a point.  It's Love.<br /><br />I'm sorry I rented this movie two months ago and just got to watching it last night.  Don't be like John Kreese and miss out on the opportunity to win the Karate Championships like I did....open your own Dojo Of The Heart and check out 'The King's Speech' today!
B004I744AS|5.0|awesome very informative and easy to use, love the way it links words in an article for easy lookup. thanks
B005LAIH54|4.0|This is not by any means a bad film in fact it is better then most movies i have seen in recent years. Do not pay the 3D price for the movie because the 3D does nothing special to enhence the movie.See it in 3D only if you are a die hard fan of 3D films. The movie opens up with sam worthington and the boy who plays his son the film picks up real quick and the action does not stop. My only real com<br />plant about the movie was i was kind of hoping for a longer battle scene bewteen the mahkai army and the human army. There is a battle scene they do show it happening but if you want a battle scene like lord of the rings return of the king or the two towers then you will be somewhat disappointed.All in all this film is worth watching and buying when it comes out on dvd. You do not have to watch the first movie as it does not follow the first movie that close there are things mentioned in this movie that happened in the clash of the titans but it still does not follow the first movie that close
B006P3HXZG|5.0|We loved watching this movie. And I love the fact that we can watch it in 3D as well as in a regular DVD player. My whole family loved it, and my 5 year old sat through the whole movie....twice!!!! Good movie!
0446585025|2.0|The book was not funny at all. There were couple of funny pages. I kept reading hoping that the book would pick up but it was bland.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire enjoy it except for the pop up ads before each game would be much more fun if I didn't have to always skip ads
B00136Q4P0|2.0|Why is this compilation called \\"The Essential Michael Jackson\\" when 1) \\"I'll Be There\\" by the J5 is missing and 2) It has way too many edited versions of some of MJ's biggest<br />hits.  It need's to be re-worked and re-issued for future generations of Michael's fans.  Clearly MJ did not put his stamp of approval on this one.  He was still alive and well<br />when this was released.

The shows were good. Not like the Crap that is on now. I don't even have Cable TV and more. 98% of what is on TV now is total crap. I have all kinds of old TV shows. Like. 5-0. I dream of Jeannie,Star Trek,The Bionic Woman,Cannon, Mission Impossible, ER, Mannix, The Invaders, The Outer Limits, Lost In Space, Voyage to The Bottom Of the Sea, The Time Tunnel, V, Walker Texas Ranger, Gilligan's Island, Just to name a few.

0312330537|5.0|Simply amazing job a writing by Mr. Roberts. Although the book was very long, it never felt that way. Now that I have moved on to other books, it only makes me appreciate the quality of Shantaram even more. Supposedly they are making a movie based on the book which Johnny Depp purchased. Should be interesting. I would recommend this book to anybody. What a read!!!!!

B000TEPKS4|4.0|I purched this cd for a friend, actually; who requested The band's greatest Hits.  When I received the CD, Cripple Creek was not on it.  That was one of their biggest hits.  I also have to admit, that I purchased 3 CDs at the time; and I may have the confused the song title with the right cD.
0307957934|4.0|The story is well told with the exception of the biggest part. We are to believe that computers have taken over after the main character begins having a very strange day and murders a man who he supposedly hired to attack him. We are never told in any credible fashion how this alternate computer universe came into being. Suggestions are made, but they do not support the conclusion. A variety of clandestine events had taken place, yet who put them into action? No credible answer is given. My vote is 3 1/2 stars, rounded up to 4. My computer gives it 5 stars!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|WOW!  Hugh should definitely get paid more for his work.  This series of stories is not your average reading material, but top notch!  I rate this with the Harry Potter series and I cannot believe I only paid $4.99 for this.  I could not put the book down and felt great anxiety having to go to bed or work instead of reading Wool.  Awesome book!

B0067Q42BY|3.0|This paid version does not record the proper score and you must see ads. Ads should be for paid version.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Love this new version! Awesome new features and challenges with enough of the same features as the other angry birds apps to make you feel comfortable. Can't wait to beat all of the new levels!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Have been using the app for about a year now.  The older version was much better, responsive and reliable.  Unfortunately since updating the app has been very sluggish and force closes frequently, I was able to find an older version and revert back to it.  2 stars for reading books on my phone, -3 stars for the problems caused by the update and the effort to have to find a previous version without these problems.
B005974CDU|5.0|Other reviews here have gone through each song and each part pretty accurately, so I'll keep this brief; This CD is just a phenomenal presentation of writing, musicianship and very dynamic interplay between all involved. Each person enhances, compliments and clearly inspires the parts of the others. I've had the disc in my truck since I bought it a few weeks ago and I still anticipate leaving for and from work to listen to it during the drive. On the Backs of Angels is just an incredible song that I cannot hear enough. Amazing. The entire CD took a few plays to get familiar with all that happens. It definitely impresses me.<br />I never bought one of their CDs before this one, although I've heard their music and I saw them live in the mid 90s. I just decided to buy this one and it turned out to be an excellent decision.

B003O86FMW|1.0|The story is excellent, especially for young adult fiction. I'd give the plot 4.5 stars, the character development 4 stars and the writing itself maybe a 3.5 only because I'm not a fan of Hemingwayish sentence fragments. Even if intentional. Annoying. LOL.<br /><br />Now that we've cleared that hurdle - THE KINDLE FORMATTING IS TERRIBLE AND DESERVES ONE STAR OR LESS.<br /><br />On nearly every page,<br />there are sent<br />  ences that  look like<br />this.<br /><br />(Bad spacing, new paragraphs in the middle of words, big gaps between words, etc. It is distracting and bad quality.)
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have had this app for a while now and I have got to say that this is one of the best that there is out there for my kindle fire.<br /><br />You can create, edit and view docs, spreadsheets and presentations.

B0011ETNXE|5.0|everything was great about this buy! it was as decribed, and it sounds great. i got it quick and i just love it
B007B6T3K4|5.0|I haven't heard any of the older Xandria material, so I am reviewing this album as a new listener. I came across this completely by accident, while browsing something else...I am not a fan of Nightwish's new 'poppy' sound, and Epica's new album wasn't as good as I hoped it would be -- however, finding this completely made up for it! Yes, they sound like Nightwish...on steroids, but their sound here leaves Nightwish in the dust. I was hooked from the moment I heard the very first few notes of 'A Prophecy of Worlds to Fall', until the end. This album never sags or lets up, not even on the slower songs. There is not a single weak song here. Oh, and I should say...Manuela Kraller can SING! Now this is what I call symphonic power METAL with balls! If you like Dark Passion Play, Tarja-era Nightwish, and Epica's The Divine Conspiracy and Design Your Universe, I highly recommend that you check this album out!
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|I really liked playing this game. It was a challenging twist on the classic bejeweled. I do wish it had been a linger game though.After I beat all the levels, I went back and beat them all perfect, but after that there's nothing &quot;new&quot; to do.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|This is a great app. it really helps with keeping track of bills by offering a payment reminder and it is very easy to use and understand.

B005UKJX4E|3.0|\\"TOL\\" is a visually lush production made up of many disparate elements that astonish, confuse, and ultimately left me shaking my head. Another Malick mash-up of ideas so weird (wounded \\"Nessy\\" on the beach) that you are compelled to believe all of it as the literal truth of geological history and our spiritual after-life. Brad Pitt is a little less expressive here than in \\"Jesse James\\".

B000006U44|5.0|David Gilmore (Pink Floyd) discovered Kate and A KICK INSIDE is the purest of Kate's work that should be remastered in true audiophile 45 rpm vinyl fashion.

B00000J2SR|3.0|Rainbow \\"Bent Out Of Shape\\"  #34  (1983).<br /><br />Rainbow's 7th and final studio album \\"Bent Out Of Shape\\", is  a hard album to like, it has some good moments, but the flow really sucked.  Produced by Roger Glover this album just has to many misses than hits.  On the hits side we get the album opener \\"Stranded\\", with some smoking guitar by Blackmore.  \\"Can't Let Go\\", is another winner.  \\"Street Of Dreams\\", #60 hot 100 and #2 MSR, which was kind of like \\"Stone Cold\\", the year before and \\"Desperate Heart\\", a solid little number.  They brought in ex-Brand X drummer Chuck Burgi on this release, Chuck would later appear with Blue Oyster Cult in the 90's.  Rainbow had a good  9 year run, but Deep Purple was reforming in late '83 and release their comeback album in '84.

B00004Y6NT|4.0|Dire Straits  \\"Communique\\"  #11  (1979).<br /><br />Dire Straits' second album \\"Communique\\", is a slight drop off from their debut.  Produced by the great Jerry Wexler (who was 62 years old at the time) and who termed \\"Rhythm and Blues\\".  This album was kind of a clone to the debut, but it has good numbers in, \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\", the smooth \\"Where Do You Think You're Going?\\", the blissful title track, they got their 2nd hit in \\"Lady Writer\\" #45, I liked this one in '79.  \\":Angel Of Mercy\\" and \\"Portobello Belle\\" are damn straight good songs.  \\"Single -Handed Sailor\\",  Mark's guitar solo is special.  This would be David Knopfler's last album with Straits.
0307352145|5.0|I took notice of Susan Cain's book when I read her Opinion piece in the New York Times about the new groupthink.  [...].<br /><br />The piece struck a nerve in my work environment because I work in a company that believes in the open office plan concept, whereas I could not concentrate on any task in this kind of office.  I was speculating that perhaps it was because of the nature of my work as a research engineer and that the open space was more suited for those who worked in marketing and sales.  But when I spoke with our HR team they were firm believers in the power of group interaction being more conducive to creative work and innovation.  This was contrary to my experience and I was having a hard time reconciling my experience with what they were telling me.  Ms. Cain's piece re=affirmed what I knew to be true.  What I did not know was just how introverted I am.  I have no problems speaking in public, I tend to be pretty social and lively in group situations, but once I started reading this book, I could see that while I was all of that, I was not \\"ON\\" all the time like others, that I did need my space and silence in order to be productive.<br /><br />Ms.  Cain definitely hit a nerve in my daily working life and then I read about her opinions on brainstorming and the fallacy that brainstorming was a productive method of innovating.  That really struck a nerve.  So I went and bought the book before it was released and I had just finished it.  It is, a truly remarkable piece of work.  One that exudes the passion that Susan Cain brings to the conversation on introversion.  The book itself is so far ranging and so all encompassing that the reading of the book is an act of self discovery, self help, and meta-study of the western extroversion.  While the book is quite heavy on the psychological studies and well documented and footnoted references, it rarely dragged.  Indeed, the scholarly bent of the tome makes the reading of it all the more convincing.<br /><br />The book is split into four parts.  Part one deals with the extrovert world, and how introverts fit into this world and how most of us cope psychologically while living outside of our own comfort zone.  Part two deals with the psychological basis for much of the author's assertions.  Part three is a slight diversion towards the examination of a culture that is introvert dominant and how those who live in that culture achieve and succeed in the extroverted world.  And finally part four has to do the the most mundane yet most important part of living: personal relationships, with spouses, friends and the raising of introverted children.<br /><br />I think this book is one of the most important books I have ever read insofar as how it affects how I view my own personality and my own life.  I can already feel the difference it makes in my own perceptions and my behavior in dealing with others and in dealing with my work and living environment.<br /><br />This book provides a great service to all introverts.  It clarifies some of the more disturbing and mysterious behavioral anomalies that inflict introverts and it allows us to understand the powers that lie hidden in our own emotional behavior.  The second part of the stated goal: to make extroverts appreciate and recognize the potential creativity unique to introverts may not be so easily achieved.  I hope that extroverts do take the time to read this book, because it will definitely stimulate discussion and perhaps inculcate an appreciation for the introverted personality.r parts.

Joe Lynn, did a solo album and filled in for an album with Deep Purple in the 90's).<br />This album \\"Difficult To Cure\\", is Rainbow's 5th studio release, a lot of people find this a Rainbow sell out, but I find it to be one of Ritchie's strongest guitar albums.  Fans of Dio's Rainbow really don't care for Joe Lynn Turner's \\"sing the phone book\\" vocals.  On this album you get the Russ Ballard tune  \\"I Surrender\\" #19 MSR, that Rainbow made their own.  \\"Spotlight Kid\\", dazzling guitar rocker with great vocals by Turner.  The instrumental \\"Vielleict Das Nasehste Mal (Maybe Next Time)\\", reminds me of Jeff Beck on this one.  \\"Can't Happen Here\\", is as strong as it gets, solid.  \\"Freedom Fighter\\", another strong song with a fine keyboard workout by Don Airey.  \\"Midtown Tunnel Vision\\", brings to mind Jimi Hendrix  on this one, Ritchie burning the threads.  The album closes with the title track which used the beginnings of Beethoven's Ninth, great stuff!  They would release an EP in mid-81 with a new song  \\"Jealous Lover\\", #13 MSR, a very strong single.  They would release the gold selling \\"Straight Between The Eyes\\", next.

B00004Y6NW|5.0|Dire Straits  #2  (1978).<br /><br />During my senior year in high school, this british band came out with one of the best albums of 1978.  Mark Knopfler had one of those guitar sounds, you just can't forget.  Dire Straits consisted of Mark Knopfler lead guitar and vocals, brother David Knopfler on rhythm guitar, Pick Withers on drums and John Illsley on bass.  The lead song \\"Down On The Waterline\\", a sweet roller, with just great lead guitar by Knopfler.  \\"Water Of Love\\", brings in some bluesy touches.  \\"Setting Me Up\\", a great rave-up, Eric Clapton covered this song on his 1980 live album \\"Just One Night\\".  \\"Six Blade Knife\\", a personal favorite, very lo-fi, oh man the sound.  \\"Southbound Again\\", upbeat, they cook on this number.  The #4 hit \\"Sultan's Of Swing\\", everyone loved this song in '78.  \\"In The Gallery\\", a pub rock type number, the beautiful \\"Wild West End\\", and the album closes with \\"Lions\\", another bar room strummer.  \\"Dire Straits\\", was produced by Steve Winwood's brother Muff.  Sharp opening album.

B00000J2SQ|4.0|Rainbow \\"Straight Between The Eyes\\"  #30  (1982).<br /><br />At the heighth of the MTV era, Rainbow released their biggest seller, \\"Straight Between The Eyes\\", I really enjoyed that cover art when this album was first released.  This album produced their first top 40 hit in \\"Stone Cold\\", #40 and #1 MSR, avery strong power ballad, should of hit top 20.  \\"Death Alley Driver\\", has that Deep Purple feel, a chugging riff rocker with some good keys by David Rosenthal.  \\"Bring On The Night (Dream Chaser)\\", AOR tune at it's best, Turner sings his heart out here.  \\"Tearin' Out My Heart\\",  is a classic in the power ballad rock department.  \\"Power\\", #35 MSR a great riff rocker.  \\"Miss Mistreated\\",  Ritchie puts his all on this one, a great rocker.  \\"Rock Fever\\", continues the party, excellent rock 'n' roll!  And the album ends with a little eastern flavored track, \\"Eyes Of Fire\\".  The band stayed the same for the first time.  Who would believe in 1983, they would release their last studio album \\"Bent Out Of Shape'?  I didn't.

B003EYVXV4|5.0|I have been waiting for this film to come out forever.  Having read the books I was a little concerned when the casting was announced, however, the movie is incredible and I was not disappointed.  Jennifer Lawrence is awesome as Katniss Everdeen.  Perfect.  The movie basically stays true to the trilogy in content and in spirit.  The scene when Katniss looks at the audience when she is being interviewed on TV is amazing.  You can tell that even though Katniss is young she has been through a lot and has some wisdom.  She has also been completely submerged in poverty and is numb from seeing the excesses of the Capitol.  I appreciated the way the director showed Katniss's vulnerability throughout the film.  She's a young girl, she's not a comic book superhero.  When she shoots arrows she sometimes misses.  She's human.  She's real.  I liked the way the movie didn't shy away from depicting the horror of the games when older, stronger children literally butcher younger frail children and hunt down others.  I didn't like the violence, but I liked that the director didn't try to candy coat the scenario.  The movie stayed true to the books in many areas including the Rue incident.  This incident in particular is important as seen when Thresh (the second tribute from District 11) refrains from harming Katniss.  All of District Eleven -- all the districts -- were watching when Katniss honored Rue.  Katniss honoring another district's tribute starts the wheels in motion that ultimately bring about war.  I plan on buying this film when it comes out on dvd.  And now I am anxiously awaiting the sequel which will cover book 2 and show Katniss's life when she is forced to embark on a tour of the districts like some pageant queen.  She will suffer the consequences of her rebellion and she will once again be sucked into The Hunger Games.  I highly, highly recommend this dvd and the book trilogy.  3/31/12
B0028MBKVG|5.0|WOW! On so many levels. How do you learn from a book that starts in a dirty mexican town with an intrepid sports magazine writer looking for 'Caballo Blanco' (white horse) and follows the writer, a ghost runner with a hazy background, and other crazy and charming (and sometimes, stinky) ultra-runners in a journey that ends in the greatest running race the world has never seen. NO that wasn't a typo, it is called the Greatest Race the World has NEVER Seen.<br /><br />I asked my brother for advice after years of not running due to injuries. Injuries that keep you in Podiatrists offices and the office of the greatest \\"running Orthopedist\\" in the lower Central States. All say: \\"damn genetics, I don't care what your brother runs - take up swimming\\"  I don't think so... I was a bit intimidated at first. My brother, an \\"ultra-distance runner\\" (50+ miles) told me to read this book, in fact he put it out there for the world to see on FB. So I got the book. AMAZING... it is a great and easy read that kept my interest from beginning to end. Mr. McDougall keeps you entertained with a great story and inserts running advice and motivation into every page. As well as a host of very different characters (based on real life).  He puts in the book- his struggles, and the latest studies on barefoot running and his journey from a 5K runner who hurts - and ends by becoming a participant in the first Copper Canyon Run that Never Was.<br /><br />Along the way we find and follow Caballo and the sports writer as he searches out The mexican tribe of 'lost runners' buried deep in the Sierra Madre's canyons, and we learn about the Tumahara Indians who live on a sparse diet and live every moment as though we are meant to be running mammals, like a panther. Finally, at the end of the book, we find out the story behind Caballo Blanco.<br /><br />A story that will only increase interest in him (Caballo) since his disappearance while running in New Mexico in March 2012. This is written now (then) so we have no idea of the future for Caballo Blanco. Only his past - and MORE importantly - his current.<br /><br />If you want a motivational book - get this one. If you want a great book to read - get this one. If you want advice on running or adaptation of the human body over the last million years (give or take)- GET AND READ THIS BOOK.<br /><br />This is not just a book for runners, there is something to be found in it for everyone. A little difficult to follow, at first, you will be absorbed in the story by the end of 2 chapters.o we have no idea of the future for Caballo Blanco.

B00006FDCJ|5.0|Clint's best picture from 1992 is also one of his best westerns ever. Very dark and gritty. He should have also won best actor for this movie. He is long overdue to win an Oscar for best actor. This one should have been it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved the first book in the Hunger Games Trilogy and couldn't wait to read the second. Even though it was good it's not even close to the first. The games in this one were not as exciting and the whole Gale or Peeta thing was kind of annoying.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I read this book not knowing to expect. But there were certain threads that never quite got wrapped up and I was hoping that they would. I LOVED the first two books. Christian captured my heart and I thought Ana was his match. The end of the second book didn't wrap up the threads the author had created, but left me with a positive feeling about the couple and their life together.<br /><br />I have to admit I'm very disappointed in this book. I'm heartbroken, actually. I think the author ruined Christian in this book. He doesn't grow at all. He treats Ana with complete disrespect and she just allows it, because \\"he's a wounded little boy.\\" I think it shows complete disrespect of his wife and her feelings that he financially supports his ex-subs. Yes, it's a nice thing, but Ana has told him over and over that this bothers her. Yet he continues to do it. And he does it behind her back at the same time. And the whole thing with Mrs. Robinson at the end I felt was completely mishandled. I get that it was supposed to be the moment when he realizes that what she did was really molestation. I could have forgiven him had Mrs. Robinson gone to him and then made a pass at him, but he didn't. HE went to HER and I can't forgive him for that. Ana's told him how much it hurts her to see him constantly run to that woman. Again, it shows complete disrespect for his wife. And in the end, he just apologizes and says I'm sorry and Ana forgives him, because, again, \\"he's her wounded little boy.\\" I don't buy it. He's an adult. Time to grow up.<br /><br />I also found the book very long winded. Yes, it was sweet to see the two of them happy in the beginning. It was painfully slow and every single thing they did, including going to the bathroom, was detailed. That's honestly the best part of this book. Because about 40% in, things take a downhill spiral. They argue for the sake of arguing, where, again, Ana just gives in, all of which is supposed to look like conflict on the page, but really isn't. It got boring and I skimmed at least 30% of this book, simply because the detail was just too much. At this point, I'm sorry I read this one. I should have stopped with the second one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. Started it one day in October of last year and couldn't stop reading! Katniss is such a great main character. She isn't anything like lots of female leads they have these days, vulnerable and weak. She is the exact opposite. Even though the Hunger Games does not start until more than halfway through the book it is still really good and should not be missed.

B0034G4ORC|3.0|When aliens invade, the first thing they do is take out the surfers. Makes perfect sense to me. Watch this movie for the action and special effects, not for the corny story. The aliens are unimaginative mechanical contraptions. No matter how many times the Marines get attacked from rooftops, they seem to think it's a good idea to march down the middle of the street. The aliens have a centralized command center and they stupidly leaving it hanging in the air to assure that it will be an easy target. Aaron Eckhart seems to have learned how to act by copying The Batman's deep whisper while Eckhart was playing Harvey Dent.<br /><br />Things I liked: pundits on talk shows speculating about the reason for the invasion when they have no idea what they're talking about; cool alien battle vehicles; lots of explosions. There are some good visuals here. The story follows a predictable formula but it's a reliable formula, making this sort of a fun, guilty-pleasure type movie. You might want to watch it with the sound off; otherwise you'll start thinking about the story and asking, repeatedly, \\"Why did that happen?\\" 3 1/2 stars.

1451648537|5.0|There are and will be no shortage of books and publications from people claiming to have known or rubbed elbows with Steve Jobs, some of which is nothing more than regurgitated bits from news sources. Being as this was the sanctioned biography, I found it refreshing and offered much insight although some of it not new to anyone who's followed Mr. Jobs for over twenty years, but puts into context. Having been to and witnessed Walt Isaacsons's book meetings where, as Mr. Isaacson later observes, there was no shortage of attendees (and readers) who seemed more interested in Mr. Jobs's [rough edges of] personality. The man was what he was... a brilliant, intense, single-minded, determined individual, a huge influence and game changer of such we will not see in a very long time. He was also a devoted father regardless of what people think they know or heard, and we should keep that in mind before slandering or slamming him. Kudos to Walt for carrying out the task. Looking forward to the book addendum mentioned at the meeting.

The movie was good, and stayed almost flawfless from the book. I cried, and laughed, and cried some more. Well done Suzanne Collins, looking forward to more of your writings!
B006L9B6TI|4.0|... then you'll enjoy The Magic. It's really more of the same information and encouragement found in The Secret, but with a wonderful 30-day worksheet/assignment type of portion to the book. I've been a proponent of living a grateful, abundance-filled life, manifesting and consciously creating my reality. This book is positive, upbeat and motivating, providing support, encouragement and ideas for continuing to fulfill that lifestyle. If you haven't read The Secret or seen The Secret video, you will want to start with that before you read The Magic, because I think it gives a deeper, more thorough understanding of the meaning behind the stories told in this book. It's not necessary that you've read The Secret first, though. I simply think it's best to have a firm foundation on understanding conscious creation and manifestation and gratitude in your life.<br /><br />The Magic is like a textbook in a way for living your life consciously, creating your reality, working with the Law of Attraction, living in gratitude, etc. Whatever name or phrase you use to describe it, this book explains how and more importantly why living with gratitude, love and abundance works to bring more of all the above. It's like a guide, with full instructions on how to manifest your life exactly like you want it to be! That said, the same as with classes in school, it's best to take the prerequisits before taking a course. This is much the same way. You can still learn, but you'll learn more if you start at the beginning and work up to The Magic.
0062073559|5.0|One of the few Agatha Christie novels that has been adapted for the stage, radio, television, PC gaming, graphic novel and film, \\"Death on the Nile\\" is one of her most famous and popular mysteries, up there with [[ASIN:0062073508 Murder on the Orient Express]], [[ASIN:0062073486 And Then There Were None]] and [[ASIN:0062073567 The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]].<br /><br />Simon Doyle and Jacqueline de Bellefort are desperately, madly, completely in love, and are engaged to be married despite Simon losing his job and neither of them having much money. However, Jackie makes the mistake of going to her best friend, wealthy and dazzling Linnet Ridgeway, in the hopes of securing a position for Simon on her new estate. Three months later, and Simon has called off his wedding to Jackie and married Linnet instead.<br /><br />Christie's famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot happens to run across the honeymooning couple in Egypt, and discovers that they are being hounded wherever they go by the embittered Jackie. Unable to lose her, Linnet implores Poirot to exert his influence; but in this matter Poirot's sympathies lie with the jilted girl. However, he does take the opportunity to urge Jackie to give up on her vendetta and return home; Jackie rejoins that she cannot, and that she cherishes dreams of shooting Linnet with the small pistol that she always carries with her.<br /><br />It is on a pleasure cruise down the River Nile that things come to a head. After an altercation between Simon and Jackie in the ship's saloon, one which ends in a serious injury for one of the participants, Linnet is found dead the following day, shot through the head as she lay sleeping. All the evidence points to Jackie as the obvious culprit, but Poirot is quick to ascertain that such a thing was impossible. Who then was responsible for taking the young heiress's life?<br />Helped along by his friend Colonel Race (a detective and ex-army man who appears in several Christie novels), Poirot is kept busy by a bevy of clues to sift through: a missing murder weapon, a J written on the wall in blood, a splash in the night, the sound of running footsteps, a near-fatal accident with a dislodged boulder, a stolen string of pearls - none of it seems to fit together, and soon enough, more bodies begin to pile up.<br /><br />There are plenty of lesser mysteries at work as well, ones which include blackmail, forgery, embezzlement, and rumors of a criminal on board ship, as well as the usual romantic entanglements, all of which make the plot of \\"Death on the Nile\\" extremely busy. No wonder both film adaptations cut down considerably on some of the more superfluous plots and characters!<br /><br />I had watched both the [[ASIN:B001KP2J3U 1978 film]] and the [[ASIN:B0002TVWZ6 2004 television adaptation]] before reading Christie's novel, and despite knowing the solution to the key mystery, I was fascinated by the changes each screenplay made to the original text. Both films combine the characters of Linnet's maids, Marie and Louise, and both omit the characters of Fanthorp, Richetti and Fleetwood. However, whereas the 1978 version cuts out the Allertons, Joanna Southwood and Cornelia Robson (giving their personalities, subplots and backstories to other characters), the 2004 version (with David Suchet in his iconic role of Poirot) cuts the character of Miss Bowers and heavily downplays several others. Seemingly very conscious of its predecessor, it almost ends up being a mirror image of the earlier film in regards to what it keeps and what it changes. Though I recommend both films, watching either of them before reading the book will still result in a few surprises given the complexity of Christie's mystery.<br /><br />As well as this, I was surprised to find that \\"Death on the Nile\\" was quite unlike Christie's usual style, at least by my reckoning. Christie takes her time in establishing each character, their personality and possible motivation, (we're nearly at the halfwaymark before the first body turns up) and it certainly has one of the biggest pools of suspects in her canon.  Surprisingly, Christie doesn't make much of the Egyptian locale (unlike the 1978 film does in the hands of renowned cinematographer Jack Cardiff) and yet there is still an exotic, almost claustrophobic atmosphere to the steamboat setting. Along with the distinctive array of colorful characters, the book ends on a haunting, bittersweet note that has the power to stay with you for quite some time.mark before the first body turns up) and it certainly has one of the biggest pools of suspects in her canon.

B0064T6LV8|3.0|This game, unfortunately, it not touchy enough on the controls. Sometimes it'll register a touch and sometimes it won't. I should mention, I play it on the Kindle Fire, and I've found the flippers don't always go off when I tell them too, but then sometimes the slightest touch sends them off. It's hard to get any accurate manuevers the way it is. It's not the Kindle, either, since several of my other games are perfectly touch-sensitive.<br /><br />That said, however, the graphics are really nice. The price on this game was right too, though like some have said, they are ad-heavy for the free and they do push purchasing the full game between every scene. Music/sound is annoying more than helpful, so I just turn the sound off. I would definitely consider trying the full version because of the graphics, but I'm hesitant to do so because of the flipper control being off.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|Typically when I watch a film in a theater, the questions I ask myself as the credits scroll are, 'Will I be buying this on Blu-Ray\\", and, \\"I wonder if this film will come bundled with a Digital Copy that I can add to my Itunes library.\\"  In the case of Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, I can answer \\"yes\\" to my first question, and \\"no\\" to the second.  In short, while I enjoyed the film, I don't think I can stomach the notion of ponying up money for a Blu-ray disc that only comes bundled with the UltraViolet copy.  The problem for me, and my digital movie collection is, that the UltraViolet Digital Copy isn't a digital copy at all, and even after giving this means of digital media viewing a chance, I've found the download to be clunky, slow, and mostly unbearable, and rarely available at times when I might want to watch, like during air travel.  When I complained to Warner Bros. about this very subject (after purchasing \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows II\\"), Warner Bros. graciously offered me an Itunes version of the film.  The WB offer certainly was a giant step to creating good will and at the same time seemed a bit of a rejection of the format they were trying to shove at me (claiming it was a digital copy).  For me, I think being forced to take something that I don't want, all the while telling me that it's the digital copy that I do want has caused me to loose some of the love for collecting movies.  Oh, I'm sure I'll still purchase and watch movies, but I'll think twice about taking the combo Blu-ray/Ultra Violet movies.

1451683405|1.0|I have had a long term interest in consciousness and since free will is a key element, I was interest in this book. I must say I was disappointed. Therefore, for me the only good point is that the book is very short. As I started to prepare this review, I started reviewing notes I made in the margins as I read the book. However, I found I had a difference of opinion on almost every page, and it was then that I realized that Harris and I were operating with two different definitions of free will. No wonder I could not agree with much of what he said. Therefore, I will take an overview approach rather than discuss each point where I had a problem. It turns out that the subject of free will is much more complicated than Harris indicates. There are many different viewpoints that have been debated for many centuries.<br />I generally agree with the definitions found in the online dictionaries such as Cambridge Dictionaries Online: the ability to decide what to do independently of any outside influence or the Free Merriam Webster Dictionary: freedom of humans to make choices that are not determined by prior causes or by divine intervention. These views are of the Libertarianism perspective that humans have free will. Harris has the view that is more in line with the philosophy of Hard Determinism, which in effect says that everything we do is determined by prior events and actions. Therefore, we have no control over our actions nor do we have free will. A search of the internet will provide more information on the different philosophies.<br /> So the debate boils down the degree of influence prior events and experiences have on our current behavior and then to what degree do we have control and free will. The options are we either have a perfectly clean slate in which to make new decisions and exercise free will or we are totally controlled by external factors and prior events or we have a position somewhere in between. To make a decision with a totally clean slate without any outside influence or memory of the past would render that individual useless and incapable of making any decision. Obviously, it is desirable to be influenced but not totally controlled by external factors. For example, knowing that it is cold outside may influence you to wear a coat that day. You actually have a choice not wear a coat and suffer the cold as most of us have done at some time. My belief is that outside factors do influence our decisions and we desire that to be true, but those factors do not totally control our actions. In complex situations we analyze the options by purposely bringing in outside data to assist in the making a decision. Do these outside factors then totally control our decisions? I submit that even after a detailed analysis, conclusions are sometimes not followed and a contrarian decision is made. That is free will in action.<br />Believing that all actions are the result of previous actions implies that universe is deterministic. Much of it is as determined by the laws of science and nature. However, much in the natural world is indeterminate due to noise, randomness, chaos and emergence. The relatively new phenomenon of Emergence is pertinent to this discussion, but it is relatively difficult to describe. When you have a very complex system you often observe a different set of outputs in addition to those the system would normally predict. These new outputs seem to take on a life of its own. One of the best definitions is by Jeffrey Goldstein in Emergence as a Construct..., - \\"the arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns and properties during the process of self-organization in complex systems\\". Of the many emergent properties I believe one of the most interesting is the radical novelty exhibited. One of the best examples of a system exhibiting emergent properties is the World Wide Web. Knowing all the expected performance of the internet, no one could have predicted the results we see today. An example associated with this discussion is that of the human mind. It is possible to predict much of human behavior due to various stimuli, but it is impossible to predict the novel ideas that come out of the mind. That results from consciousness and thinking and the free will to think what we want. That is the source of human creativity which is closely related to free will. How many times have you when presented with an array of choices come up and freely chose a totally different and novel choice. If you are still not sure of creativity and free will talk to an artist, scientist, engineer or inventor.<br />Like some others in the past, Harris uses the experiment by Benjamin Libet to \\"show\\" there is no free will. In a clever experiment Libet and others showed that the mind makes a decision from ½ to several second before the subject was aware of the decision. There are several problems with the typical conclusions from these experiments. The first is that the mind consists of both the subconscious and the awareness component operating together. It does show again that the subconscious does a large percentage of the minds activity. That combination is my intellect and I believe still has free will. Even with all the repeats, the experiments were performed in a calm laboratory environment. What would happen if the tests were done in a crisis environment? I submit that the subject would be aware of the situation at the same time or even before the subconscious and if so that would negate the argument that there is no free will.<br />Now let us visualize a world where Harris is correct and all of our actions are the result of random prior events with us having no control. Now visualize the world I just described where we have creativity and free will of our actions. Now visualize the modern world we have today that started about 10,000 years ago when someone probably first said \\"let us put these things we will call seeds into the ground and see if something will grow\\" and then evolving to the present state of our world. I do not believe there is any way the Harris model of no free will would have made any advancements much less the human advancement we have witnessed. So do we have free will? How about you in your own situation? Is where you are the result of random events or did you have some part in it?<br />Finally, there is one more comment I have about the book. Harris, in every book he writes, makes a jab a religion. I find his comments amusing. For example on page 56 he writes: \\"Within a religious framework, a belief in free will supports the notion of sin - which seems to justify not only harsh punishment in this life but eternal punishment in the next\\". First of all I do not see how belief in free will supports the notion of sin; instead I believe just the opposite. More importantly, sin is not what determines our eternal life; in Christianity the free will acceptance or rejection of Jesus is what determines that. If it were determined by our sin we all would live in eternal punishment. I do not mean to be hash on Harris, and in fact I have a special liking of atheist. You see after sending my youth in the church, I at age 18 decided I did not believe in God. It was just my 18-year old mentality with no influenced from anyone nor anything I read. I held that belief for 50-years with the 18-year old mentality until one day I decided to do an objective and analytical investigation as I often had done in my engineering career. I realized I had been wrong all those years. I wrote a book about my experiences, [[ASIN:143926841X My God, Your God?]] I only bring it up in case you are interested in the study I did on consciousness and free will. There are four chapters on consciousness (three secular) that go into more detail.<br />If you are really interested in free will there is a great book by neuroscientist, Michael S. Gazzaniga, [[ASIN:0061906107 Who's in Charge?: Free Will and the Science of the Brain]]ith this discussion is that of the human mind. It is possible to predict much of human behavior due to various stimuli, but it is impossible to predict the novel ideas that come out of the mind. That results from consciousness and thinking and the free will to think what we want. That is the source of human creativity which is closely related to free will. How many times have you when presented with an array of choices come up and freely chose a totally different and novel choice. If you are still not sure of creativity and free will talk to an artist, scientist, engineer or inventor.<br />Like some others in the past, Harris uses the experiment by Benjamin Libet to \\"show\\" there is no free will.

In other words, we'll all be working at the internet flea-market with no health or retirement benefits or even any social safety nets.

But what will your young reader think?<br /><br />  I've been reading all of the books going into the kids' library, and that has been an eye opener. \\"Robin Hood\\" is really very exciting. \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" is virtually unreadable. \\"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\\" is a hoot and Rebecca is a pistol. \\"Peter Pan\\" is almost creepy around the edges.<br /><br />  And as for Stevenson? These books are fresh, exciting, and absorbing, even for kids weaned on video games and short attention requirements. \\"Treasure Island\\" just keeps building and \\"Kidnapped\\" feels like non-fiction. This isn't just high seas and pirates. This is treasure, treasure hunting, running around on an island, hiding out from villains, sneaky nighttime daring-do. This is good stuff, and it still works.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|While I didn't really appreciate Warner Bros. for releasing the final movie in two parts it was also expected to to keep this major cash cow going.  What I do appreciate was the actors and actresses for sticking with the movie series from start to finish which is greatly appreciated, especially as you actually see the cast grow up in these movies is astonishing.  The second part of the Deathly Hollows movie will definitely give you all the action you wish you saw in the first part,  though expect some heart aches as well as some beloved characters meet their destined fate.  The video quality is great as well as the audio I'll probably get the entire series on blu-ray when the price becomes a little more acceptable.  So while this dvd ends the series which is a little sad considering the how long ago the first movie came out(2001) we still have these dvds to relive this great saga.  Sadly now though all we'll probably get more bombarded with are cheap knockoffs and wannabes that pretty much are just pirating the storyline from this series(Percy Jackson anyone?)...
B003X2O6KW|5.0|It was difficult to keep track of all the hyperbole following the release of this album, with some deeming it the Kid A of the 2010's and others calling it a picasso like masterwork and lets not forget the perfect 10.0 it received from everyones favourite music site pitchfork media. Not being the worlds biggest Kanye fan i was dismisssive of all the hype, assuming the critics had so heavily backed Mr West's pretentiously titled album as an attempt to remain relevant with younger music fans. But that didn't account for the amount of love that was coming from the blogosphere and when my brother (less of a Kanye fan than me) said he'd listened to it and claimed it to be \\"suprisingy good\\", i knew i had to take the plunge.<br /><br />My first spin didn't leave me speechless, but i couldn't deny the obvious quality of the album. The songs were exciting, unpredictable, heck effervescent even, I had a few gripes about some of the audacious orchestral arrangements and some of the lyrical conceit but on the whole i filed it under very good and promptly moved onto listening to nicolas jaar's Space Is Only Noise (the first great record of 2011). A year passed and i revisited a few albums i'd been impressed with but hadn't found the time to immediately listen to again and after playing Halcyon Digest by Deerhunter for the third time i was convinced it was the standout record of 2010. But it suddenly occured to me that i'd overlooked a little known egoist from chicago who's album i'd conveniently chose to avoid listening to since last year, claiming it's excellent production was the only reason i probably enjoyed it in retrospect and i was convinced i wouldn't be dazzled by it a second time round, i enventually played it again a fortnight ago just to make sure ...<br /><br />Well i've now been officially humbled! it sounded better now than it did when i initially played it, so much so that i had to listen a third time to see just how great it was and the experience was almost magical. The entrancing quiet storm of Devil In A New Dress, the delightful piano motif in Runaway, the collective reverie of Lost In The World, it all sounded great now. No caveats, no disclaimers all the twists and turns featured on this album feel expertly crafted even the Chris Rock skit on blame game feels transcendant. I had to check the personnel kanye enlisted to see who was involved in the making of this daringly ambitious album. I wasn't suprised to see a treasure trove of big name producers behind this RZA, No I.D, Jeff bhasker, but the decision to bring in Bon Iver and Elton John was completely unexpected and wholly inspired.<br /><br />The highlights were never ending with this beast! Nicki Minaj's schizoid verse on Monster, the gorgeous strings and piano interlude before All Of the Lights, the spoken word poetry of Gil Scott Herron on \\"Who Will Survive in America\\". The richness of the tones, the varition in moods make this a thrilling listen from start to finish. If you haven't already realised i'm unashamedly doing one hell of a U-turn on this guy i can't reccommend this album highly enough. I was so impressed by My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy i promptly revisited earlier works like The College Dropout and Late Registration to see if they were much better than i remembered too. They were in case you were wondering, but neither have a patch on this MBDTF. In my opinion it's the undisputed pinnacle of 21st century Hip Hop and it's unlikely to topped by anyone (Kanye included) anytime soon.

0307352145|3.0|Quiet The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain is a thick volume full of technical information and not the more practical stuff that I was looking for. I was so excited to get this book to review from the Blogging for Books program, but was equally as unexcited when I realized it wasn't a Christian book and was, in fact, littered with mild obscenities that I didn't appreciate. While the idea is a good one (explaining introverts to the rest of the world and giving introverts ways to make it in an extroverted world), there was so much, \\"this study revealed this\\" kind of stuff that I lost interest pretty quickly and found it hard to concentrate on. I do admire the time and effort put into this book by the author, but for me, I think a better choice would have been Introverts in the Church by Adam S. McHugh. I was disappointed in this book. I was hoping for more, \\"do this and you won't feel as awkward in social situations\\" conversation.

I suppose they managed a few decent name actors of the period due to the subject matter, Guccione's involvement and the overall low tone of the times. Who could possibly spend the time writing paragraphs and paragraphs about this thing?  Well, perhaps if one is an aficionado of giant plastic peni there might be some interest in this picture.

B0007ODLCS|5.0|I've loved Townes van Zandt ever since I heard his cover of the Stones' \\"Dead Flowers\\" playing in the Big Lebowski soundtrack. It's ten times better than the original. Sadly, Roadsongs, the album of live covers that it is featured on, is out of print. But, happily, this box set is still available, and what a gem it is - collecting Townes' first seven studio albums, along with a small handful of unreleased songs and live cuts, this includes all of his sixties and seventies output (!!) and has a few extras too (!!!). Collected here are the studio recordings For The Sake of the Song (his over-produced 1968 debut), Our Mother The Mountain (1969), Townes Van Zandt (1969), Delta Momma Blues (1971), High, Low and in Between (1972), The Late Great Townes Van Zandt (1972) and Flyin' Shoes (1978). The years between those last two albums were more than Townes had ever waited before putting out music but longer waits were to come - Old Townes didn't get another album out after Flyin' Shoes until At My Window in 1987; there was only one more studio album to come, No Deeper Blue in 1994. Van Zandt passed away in 1997 after 52 years on this earth, most of the latter ones soaked in drugs and alcohol. And while it doesn't offer all of the Live at the Old Quarter, Houston, Texas double disc, recorded in 1973, they do have the eight songs that are on it that are not repeated on studio albums (ie songs that he never got around to recording in the studio, but would play live - although this is not true, since the final song \\"Only Him Or Me\\" is doubled with the studio version).<br />A documentary on his life exists called Be Here To Love Me, which I really must see - no amount of Townes is ever enough! I listen to these songs, dripping in wordcraft and flush with emotion, thinking largely of Leonard Cohen, although they are as different as they are similar: both sang sad guitar songs infused with great melody and wonderful lyrics that share a country influence, but Van Zandt's voice is so much more beautiful, and their backgrounds could not be more different (sure, they both came from moneyed backgrounds that they turned their backs on, but Cohen is from snowy, urban Montreal while Van Zandt comes from a Texas oil family). Gram Parsons would be a better comparison, but even that is not adequate - Van Zandt outlived Parsons, but was blue blue blue!<br /><br />Townes' first album, For The Sake of the Song, was released in 1968 and is full of dated flourishes. The first number, \\"For The Sake of the Song\\" is a fine folk tune that has some Mexican twinges; it's a strong, healthy tune that makes you listen right away, mainly on the merit of Van Zandt's strong yet mournful voice. Ditto for the second song, \\"Tecumseh Valley\\", a mournful song that has a tap-tapping beat and backup singers, something that was not really Townes' style. \\"For The Sake of the Song\\", \\"Tecumseh Valley\\", \\"Quicksilver Daydreams of Maria\\", \\"I'll Be Here In The Morning\\", \\"Waitin' Around To Die\\" and \\"Sad Cinderella\\" all get a less-busy stripped down sound on later albums, and they always sound exquisite without any distraction from Townes' voice, which is like pure, liquid gold. \\"Waitin' Around To Die\\" is splendid with its laid back pace on a later album, the one on the first album is good too, but it's done dramatically like some chase scene in a cowboy epic, full of crazy, expressionistic percussion. Oooh!! You just need to hear how \\"Sixteen Summers, FIfteen Falls\\" shifts from something that would have been part of a folk festival into something out of a spaghetti western.<br /><br />Our Mother The Mountain's first song \\"Be Here To Love Me\\" is already sounding more stripped-down, with a very nice country tune, although one unnecessarily augmented by some cute flute work. \\"Our Mother The Mountain\\" is a very cool song, very dark, that starts off with voice, simple guitar, and bumpy bass, with a bit of spooky flute. It builds and builds and becomes a huge crashing piece of thunder. Great, great lyrics, like so many of Van Zandt's songs, epics of the drama of a hard life like the one that he himself pursued.<br /><br />The third Townes Van Zandt album, self-titled, starts off with the same song as his first album, this time around a highly stripped down version - voice and guitar (percussion is heard in parts). Beautiful. \\"Colorado Girl\\" has a very mellow Simon and Garfunkel feel to it. It is one of the first all-acoustic guitar and voice songs. \\"Delta Momma Blues\\" is a sweet, sweet song with some great fiddle. \\"Only Him or Me\\" is just sheer beauty, hard to listen to late at night when you're alone; \\"tomorrow's half of all you've got\\". \\"Turnstyled, Junkpiled\\" sounds like it's poking fun at Paul Simon, but it's an old honkey tonk tune. \\"Nothin'\\" is a great old blues song; it is covered by Robert Plant on his Raising Sand album. \\"You Are Not Needed Now\\" starts off with wistful guitar blues, but picks up with cool churchy organ. \\"Mr Gold and Mr Mud\\" is a fast song that tells the tale of two gamblers with bizarry poke playing mythology. \\"No Lonesome Tune\\" has sublime guitar work at the end, just gorgeous. According to the liner notes, \\"To Live Is To Fly\\" is a tribute to Janis Joplin. \\"Don't Let The Sunshine Fool Ya\\" is a great singalong. There are only a few covers on the album, but one of them is Hank Williams' \\"Honky Tonkin'\\", a fun ole tune. \\"Snow Don't Fall\\" is a beautiful piano song, there are multiple version of \\"Fraulein\\" that are all fantastic, as are multiple versions of \\"Pancho and Lefty\\". \\"If I Needed You\\" is sheer perfection, \\"Houseboat In Heaven\\" has gorgeous, groaning country pinache, and \\"Loretta\\" is spooky and wonderful with great harmonica tones often-copied by the Cowboy Junkies (great lyrics, and a nice Texas twang in believe \\"b'leev\\" - is that Emmylou Harris singing harmony here?). \\"Rex's Blues\\" is pure Texas, \\"alone and low as low can be.\\" \\"Flyin' Shoes\\" is sheer slinky gorgeousness, with an appropriately-dramatic opener. Wonderful. \\"Fall is a feeling that I just can't lose.\\" \\"When She Don't Need\\" me is a nifty, exquisite piano and guitar tune that grows and builds with full tunesmanship. Rounding out the collection are songs from \\"Live at the Old Quarter, Houston, Texas\\", recorded in 1973 but released in 1977; these eight songs are supposed to be songs that don't appear elsewhere in Townes' early discography, although that doesn't seem quite true - the closing song in the collection \\"Only Him Or Me\\" was also on Townes' self-titled third album (but who cares - it's a great song, and a more-than-appropriate closer for this collection). The first of these songs is \\"Two Girls\\" (it had been the fourth song from the double-CD set), and it starts with a primary school-level joke (\\"What's white and crawls up your leg - Uncle Ben's Perverted Rice\\"). The song is full of great lyrics:<br /><br />Well the clouds didn't look like cotton, they didn't even look like clouds<br />I was underneath the weather, my friends looked like a crowd<br />The swimming hole was full of rum, I tried to find out why<br />All I learned was this my friend, you gotta swim before you fly<br /><br />Jolly Jane just lays around and listens with her mouth<br />She's had about a dozen husbands but the last one just pulled out<br />Now who's gonna bring her dinner, through the weary years ahead<br />All she get from me is sympathy, got no time to see she's fed<br /><br />\\"White Freight Liner Blues\\" is sheer country, while the Merle Travis song \\"Nine Pound Hammer\\" is pure bliss, a really great song (and much more laid back than Merle's version). Wonderful finger picking! \\"Chauffeur's Blues\\" is more blues, while \\"Cocaine Blues\\" is more blues. Very bluesy. \\"Only Him Or Me\\" is a wonderful, triste song about lost love and stubborn loners, a great way to take out a collection about Texas' loneliest star.<br /><br />There are four songs on this collection that don't appear on Townes Van Zandt albums, the first is \\"The Spider Song\\", it'sguitar and voice and some weird cowboy hum-along. \\"Upon My Soul\\" is an old honky tonk, a gorgeous uppity Christian song, lovely, with great harmonica. \\"Buckskin Stallion Blues\\" is nice, but nothing special either, while \\"At My Window\\" is sleepy and beautiful.<br /><br />There are a few eccentric songs on the album, though, that escape from the general spookiness of the beautiful voice, the perfect guitarwork and the dark themes. \\"Talkin' Karate Blues\\" is a sort of strange tale that comes off as a sort of \\"Alice's Restaurant\\", which was released in October 1967. It's kind of funny, but not really. \\"Silver Ships of Andilar\\" starts off nice, but becomes overly bombastic with the strings (it's also unusually repetitive in its harmonies - think \\"The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald\\"). Townes' cover of Bo Diddley's \\"Who Do You Love\\" is kind of nutty, not at all his strength, but it still sounds pretty cool. \\"Dollar Bill Blues\\" is squeaky and atonal and very strange and weird. \\"Fraternity Blues\\", from the live selection, is a pretty funny tale of a loner who decides to join a fraternity, but realises that he's better-suited to a fraternity (\\"if you want to have friends, it's gonna cost you\\"). \\"Talking Thunderbird Blues\\" is a cool/funny song about someone drinking' Thunderbird. Wicked. \\"Thunderbird's not an Indian trinket/ It's a wine, man, you take it home and you drink it.\\"<br /><br />It's hard to resist the temptation to write about this release song for song and simply to day \\"this song is amazing too\\", because they really all are! Anyone who likes Chris Isaac, Nick Drake (a Texas version of), Leonard Cohen (ditto), Bob Seger in his most wistful moments (a stretch, maybe) or Elliott Smith would fall deeply in love with Townes.

B000MM0L2S|5.0|Although I'm somewhat of a fan of the movie music of Ennio Morricone, I have just discovered this wonderful tribute album of some of his 'greatest hits'. The artist selection and the editing linking one track to the next makes this collection especially enjoyable. As other reviewers have stated, the Metallica cover of 'The Ecstasy of Gold' alone is worth the price - but there's so much more. If you lean towards liking mainly one type of music, let's say for example top forty, this album probably won't be your cup of tea. But if your musical tastes are truly eclectic, and you have even a slight aquaintance with Morricone's work (and who doesn't), you should check this out. Highly recommended.

You just go along for the ride and are excited when you recognize famous writers and painters.  These characters are woven into the plot seamlessly.  Being a Woody Allen movie, I hadn't expected such a careful, low key approach.  However, you can definitely hear Woody's words coming out of the characters mouths.  It isn't often that my husband and I agree on a movie, but he enjoyed it too.  In fact, he's the one who said we should order the DVD after watching it from an Amazon download.  This movie is well worth the time and money.
B003FNLZ62|5.0|Forget the gut wrenching drama, the emotional twists and turns, the stunningly alive characterization, this book is just plain beautifully written, surpassing even Catcher in the Rye in its raw power.

B00756GKBA|5.0|To leave a negative review just because you don't like(hate)the artist is just sad and childish! Some if not most of the  negative reviews on this product come form people who have not listened to the album or care to do.  This is an Amazing body of work and it fits right up there with the other Great albums Madonna has released in the past like \\"Ray of light\\" and \\"Music\\". Buy it and don't let Hateful comments/people stop you form enjoying Music.

0316044695|2.0|I bought the book looking for insight into the SEAL's combat operations and the events leading up to the failed rescue attempt. What I got was a heavily ghost (re)written tale of poor mission planning and zero military professionalism. Bravado is no substitute for fundamental planning and practices.<br /><br />What got to me worst was when the author describes how after rescue he broke down in tears meeting his SEAL commander, described as the \\"first person who really cared about me\\" he encountered since the attack. This almost immediately after leaving the Afghan village which protected him (a complete stranger) with their lives for no other reason than it was the right thing to do. Compare this to the author's earlier expressed willingness to butcher unarmed goat herders because *they* hadn't bothered to plan what to do in case of compromise?
B001NT057K|4.0|The songs that come with the album are great<br /><br />I am Very Happy with this download<br /><br />It has all the songs from the movie
B000UOGHKS|5.0|The lacklustre, lazily-written MDNA album has been shelved in my home and after a near week-long marathon I can't say I have plans to revisit it anytime soon.  I decided to dust off \\"Erotica\\" instead to remind me why despite it's unfair reputation as a failure, it remains my favorite of her '90s output. The cold, urban, almost-industrial production of Shep Pettibone served Madonna well on these songs, just as well as anything she'd done with Pat Leonard, if not better. Madonna herself should give this a spin and take note that the production should ENHANCE her vocals, not overpower them. Even the lesser tracks like \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" have catchy hooks you'll be humming long after the CD has stopped.<br /><br />That's not to say \\"Erotica\\" is a slice of perfection from start-to-finish as there are a few missteps right from the beginning. The opening number/first single with it's over-the-top explicit references to S&M is the audio equivalent of the whole \\"Sex Book\\" fiasco and the fact it's a non-melodic rip-off of the similarly unimpressive \\"Justify My Love\\" makes it one of the weakest entries. Also less impressive but still good are \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" (the contrast of 1930s victrola-sounding vocals over hip-hop beats is interesting). The looped bassline makes \\"Waiting\\" a little monotonous and its spoken passages are too similar to \\"Justify My Love/Erotica\\"--but it's more melodic. \\"Words\\" sounds like they took the instrumental from the rap section of \\"Vogue\\" and built a song around it.  Madonna may have been trying for shock value in \\"Where Life Begins\\" which was probably inspired by the silly \\"Sex\\" book poem \\"My P*ssy\\". The irony is that despite it's crude subject matter, the arrangement of \\"Where Life Begins\\" is perhaps the most sophisticated-sounding of the entire album with lovely, understated piano and saxophone. There's a vintage 1970s \\"Brother Louie\\" influence on this that would serve her well on her next studio album and it's lead-off single/album highlight \\"Secret\\". The closing number \\"Secret Garden\\" is like a continuation of \\"Where Life Begins\\", a mix of hip-hop beats and cocktail lounge music.<br /><br />Some of Madonna's best dance-floor numbers appear on this album, even though most probably haven't been played in clubs in years. Despite the fact she's the millionth person to cover \\"Fever\\", she and Pettibone bring a fresh '90s flavor to it and the song's simplicity makes it a far more natural choice for a remake than attempting to redo \\"American Pie\\". Her sexy, airy vocals are front and center--sadly the same can't be said for the current Madonna album where they are often buried underneath layers of techno noise. An intoxicating ode to surrender, \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" borrows \\"Vogue\\"s rhythm and expands on it with a fuller sound and mid-song salsa interlude (and an unsung gay anthem if there ever was one when she shouts \\"My love is alive and I'm never gonna hide it again\\"). \\"Thief of Hearts\\" is Madonna at her most confrontational--a blueprint for later scathing attacks such as \\"She's Not Me\\" or \\"Gang Bang\\". Except here the only weapon she needs is her own physicality (\\"Which leg do you want me to break?\\")--not a firearm. When she looks her competition up and down and huffs \\"I can break you\\" we BELIEVE her. This is the Madonna I miss--fierce, determined and expressive.<br /><br />The real highlight of this album is the trio of \\"Rain\\", \\"Why's It So Hard\\", and \\"In This Life\\". Pettibone builds the layers of \\"Rain\\" so subtly and gradually until Madonna's performing a monologue with herself over a Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis backbeat. \\"Rain\\" features Madonna at her most plaintive, while the urban hip-hop cry for social unity (and gay acceptance?) in \\"Why's It So Hard\\" is as 'street' as she ever sounded without resorting to dropping F-bombs and letting unnecessary guest rappers steal her thunder. The haunting \\"In This Life\\" is the best ballad she ever recorded IMO as Madonna memorializes some of the close friends she's lost to AIDS (thesimple but ominous piano chords that open this one tell us immediately there is no happy ending coming here and you'll get goosebumps when she delivers the line \\"Have you ever watched your best friend die?\\").

B000YIGNKE|3.0|Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins are both very admirable in their roles. However, I cannot give this production more stars because of the overly fast pace of the plot. I felt that the story short-changes the emotional drama and suspense experienced by Anne's character and thereby strips it of dramatic tension. Why were the filmmakers in such a hurry?? I believe they largely wasted the cast in this manner. Both leads are more than capable of developing more profound characterizations with more time.<br /><br />I concur with the objections of others near the end, where Anne runs around Bath in an undignified fashion. It tells us that she really means business this time, but what does it tell us about Wentworth? Is he so lily-livered that he will not come back to check on Anne? I vastly prefer the confidence she shows us in the 1990s version with Root and Hinds, where she waits expectantly for his return. This earlier version of the ending also demonstrates more of the intellectual and emotional bonds the two characters so easily share.<br /><br />In some ways I prefer Rupert Penry-Jones' interpretation partially because I believe Ciaran Hinds seems too mature for the actual age of Wentworth.<br /><br />Another reason I prefer the 1990s version is that the pacing at times feels somehow very realistic to me, with a quietness that actually puts the viewer into the time period and lets him/her share the experience, rather than merely watching it. Anne's experience of frustration and anxiety are more deeply sensed by the audience by allowing the events to occur as they happen in the novel.<br /><br />All in all, this newer version is not unwatchable, but it is rushed and superficial.

0439023521|5.0|Hunger, Not a Game<br /><br />We are hungry that's for sure and it's NOT a game. This movie and book was an excellent portrayal of this world's lust and hunger for the relationship we want to have with each other. This story of a televised hunt to the death is the epitome of reality shows of today. We want to see into each others lives, we want to see how each other handles fear, sadness, disappointment, anger, death, life. We want to see and we want to be seen. This is a cry for a deeper relationship with other human beings. The sad thing is that without love for each other this story pretty much shows where we are headed. Katniss, the main character and soul behind that world's rebellion against the Hunger Games was faced with just that. Just to be rid of the horrors of Hunger Games was not enough. A Love for each other had to replace the anger, fear and control of the government. This story, book and movie seems to be a warning. What are you hungry for??

B006RUJST6|5.0|Ethics is defined as: The moral correctness of specified conduct.<br /><br />Love is: A feeling of warm personal attachment or deep affection.<br /><br />Hope: A feeling of expectation and desire for a certain thing to happen.<br /><br />Separately these words have very different meanings, but when combined they introduce us to a new word...<br /><br />Agony: Extreme physical or mental suffering.<br /><br />Our lives are full of people that leave marks. Some of these marks are barley distinguishable, little blips on a remarkably large radar.  While others are much larger, akin to quilts or blankets that wrap around us like comfortable memories.  There are happy mark, sad marks, marks  meant to be malicious or acidic. And some marks aren't marks at all, they are strings attached to our cores that quiver and stiffen when tampered with.<br /><br />Strings are the best and worst kind of mark.  They are ones that cause us to question our ethics, to fall in love, to give up hope, or to live in agony, and Layken from \\"Slammed\\" is tangled up in them.<br /><br />  \\"After the unexpected death of her father forces eighteen year old Layken and her family to move across the country, away from everyone and everything she knows, her outlook on life is anything but hopeful.<br /><br />  Enter Will Cooper: the attractive twenty-one year old new neighbor with an intriguing passion for slam poetry. After a night together that turns out to be everything but the expected, both Layken and Will are left with feelings they never knew they could have. Unfortunately in Layken's life, things are never what they seem. Just as quickly as it develops, their relationship is derailed by a shocking revelation, sparking a tumultuous battle between their hearts and their ethics.<br /><br />  As if the dramatic turn of events in her life isn't enough, Layken is slammed again when her mother reveals a secret of her own. A secret so intense, all of Layken's current problems pale in comparison to her seemingly insurmountable future. Unable to confront the changes that lie ahead of her, Layken ignores her conscience as she turns to Will for solace. Struggles ensue as both Layken and Will search for a balance between that which keeps them apart and the feelings that pull them together.\\"<br /><br />Love is a complicated concept, and because it is...it makes for a dang good story. The most welcome of stories (of course) are those that end in \\"happily every after\\" but that doesn't necessarily mean they are the \\"best\\" stories. No, that word: BEST is only bestowed upon those that teach us lessons, cause us to think irrationally or question what our OWN actions would be if thrown into a similar situation.<br /><br />\\"Slammed\\" by Colleen Hoover is one of the \\"best.\\"<br /><br />So...what exactly is the \\"ethical situation\\" that has me so upside down?<br /><br />Sorry, not going to tell you (it will ruin the book.)  But I will go on record as saying that it's a huge one. Life altering in fact, and not just for the characters but for you, the reader. Why? Because there is no correct answer. The characters, (who by the way are developed wonderfully and evoke so much emotion that I again -God this is becoming a horrible habit- found myself blubbering over) are stuck inside this agonizing loop of brain vs. heart, and regardless of the fate they choose they are going to loose something of value. The beauty of the book comes in the struggle to find out which one is more important.<br /><br />The plot ISN'T particularly original. You can see this same scenario in 85% of YA television these days, but the people involved (Lake, Will, Julia, etc.) bring it to life in such an extraordinary manner that it makes you feel as though it is, (new and sparkly that is.) And...as if the first drama wasn't enough to rattle your cage another monkey wrench is thrown into the engine at around the 60% mark and you are forced to start your deconstruction of morality all over. (*shakes fist at Colleen*)<br /><br />Were there any problems in Colleen's 30 day journey into writing? (Oh, did I not mention she wrote this entire book in a month?) Yeah, maybe a few..but nothing enough for me to warrant mentioning. More importantly...if you're reading it correctly, you'll be too tied down to your Kleenex to give a crap.<br /><br />In one sentence: I fell in love with this book, and you should too.<br /><br />Spend the dough, learn the lesson, and when you are done...tell me what YOU would do?<br /><br />Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: words are only half of the battle, it's what you do with them that matters!<br /><br />A quick note: After finishing Slammed I immediately purchased it's follow up \\"Point of Retreat\\" and though it's not as good, it's still worth reading.<br /><br />Were there any problems in Colleen's 30 day journey into writing?

I bought the book several hours ago and even though I've already seen all of the pictures, I can't stop staring at them!<br /><br />This book truly demonstrates what an incredible talent Alexander McQueen had.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|As a youngster I read every Edgar Rice Burroughs book I could find and I am fairly certain I read them all - John Carter of Mars is one of the book series he authored, along with other series including: John Carson of Venus, Pellucidar & Tarzan being amoung the better known.<br /><br />Disney did a good job adhering to the book which opens the series and believe me, given the book content it was no easy task to pack in every nuance of the 1st book in the series into a single movie, but to those who never read the book series it leaves a great deal unexplained.  To Edgar's avid readers it was simply a joy to see the characters come to life on the screen.<br /><br />3D was not necessary for the story and didn't really do it for me.  The CGI was excellent and true to the various creatures as described in the novels, especially Woolla.  No slight to the actress playing Dejah but the book series often referred to her as the most beautiful woman on 2 planets with wars being fought over her - and, very scantily clad (translated, lol,  just about naked), not how I would describe the movie Dejah Thoris Princess of Helium - the actor playing John Carter was quite good.<br /><br />In a nutshell the story is about an American former confederrate officer and educated gentleman from Virginia who after the ravages of the civil war seeks his fortune in the wild west looking for gold.  A former professional soldier with a great aptitude, talent and experience at fighting (as well as liking a good fight) -is pursued by Indiams and hides in a cave which the Indians will not enter due to mystical properties therein and he awakes to find himself mysteriously transported to Mars, called Barsoom by the natives (while his corporeal body remains on earth hidden in the cave no less).  He finds that the lesser gravity of Mars coupled with his personal fighting skills make him a force to be reckoned with amoung the various warlike species on intelligent life on Barsoom (Mars).  He quickly learns the languages of Barsoom.<br /><br />He is constantly encountering hostile intellegent creatures, kicking butt and displaying his greater strength etc. but as a man of honor and a southern gentleman he wins over many a former foe and wins the heart of the most beautiful woman on 2 planets the Princess of Helium (one of the many warring kingdoms of Barsoom).<br /><br />Bottom-line I enjoyed the movie and will purchase the dvd when it comes out - I gave it 5 stars because the task of translating the book to the screen was (to me) a near impossible task and Disney Studios did a very difficult task quite well all things considered.<br /><br />Read the books - then see the movie - I assure you sci-fi fans out there will be hooked.ns the languages of Barsoom.<br /><br />He is constantly encountering hostile intellegent creatures, kicking butt and displaying his greater strength etc. but as a man of honor and a southern gentleman he wins over many a former foe and wins the heart of the most beautiful woman on 2 planets the Princess of Helium (one of the many warring kingdoms of Barsoom).<br /><br />Bottom-line I enjoyed the movie and will purchase the dvd when it comes out - I gave it 5 stars because the task of translating the book to the screen was (to me) a near impossible task and Disney Studios did a very difficult task quite well all things considered.<br /><br />Read the books - then see the movie - I assure you sci-fi fans out there will be hooked.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|I enjoyed it. And will re-watch it again. I disagree with the online critics about it being misogynic, rather it jars viewers on the abuse patients/prisoners are subject to by care-takers in instituitions and brothels in real-life.<br />The film has stylish cinematography and sumptious visuals as what you'd expect from the movies '300' and 'Watchmen'. Gorgeous battles and fight-scenes. The cabaret dance scene is excellent. I like the intriguing way the film morphs between fantasy and reality, it gets you thinking about it long after to figure out the symbolisms later.<br />Plus it gets points for featuring music by The Smiths \\"Asleep\\"; Eurythmics; Queen.<br />Emily Browning is captivating as ever as are the other eye-candy actresses.<br />The extended version has 15+mins with the High-roller etc, makes it whole but unjustly gets an R-rating.
0545259088|5.0|While I have read many other reviews on this book saying that it was a disappointment and did not have the same appeal of the other two books in the trilogy, I actually really enjoyed this book, just for different reasons than I liked the first two. For me, Cole redeemed himself in this book. I previously found him to be obnoxious and spoiled and self-absorbed, but in this book, his unique perspective on the world made his insights both entertaining and valuable. His chemistry with Isabelle is still ever-present, but unfortunately takes a back seat to the drama of Grace and Sam. What he discovers about the wolf chemical is fascinating, and I wouldn't have minded being privy to a few more of his questionable experiments, despite how dangerous the results often were. Cole is also the only character I cried over in this book - twice.<br />My favorite scene is when Sam and Grace get to be wolves together. Their connection to each other is near-visible in its strength, and the chemistry they exhibited in the previous books in renewed in this bond. That alone is enough to make me wonder if Cole's cure is really necessary.<br />What I dislike is what happens with Isabelle. She does so much to help these wolves, but in the end she does not have much say over her own destiny, either. I suppose she can kind of relate to them, in her own way.<br />The events surround Beck, Sam's father figure, are bittersweet. What happens to him I found predictable, and a kind of literary justice. His contributions to the tale were played out, and all that was left was to answer for what he did to Sam as a boy. There could have been other ways, but this one was more of a catalyst for the justice of another. Still, I feel for Sam for his loss,  even if don't share those emotions for Beck. I also can't help wondering if this entire tale could not have been so different if Shelby had never been turned.<br />While Stiefvater's open ending leaves much to the imagination, I don't mind it so much. In my head, all of the dreams and goals of the main characters are achieved, with a happy ending, as all books should be.n my head, all of the dreams and goals of the main characters are achieved, with a happy ending, as all books should be.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|after reading so many critical reviews .I personally was not disturbed by the pace of the third book. The chaotic movement in the final book is representative of a society immersed in a full scale war. The deaths of certain characters occur quickly and brutally, those affected cannot afford to respond or they too will die. War has that effect of minimizing lives. Much of the behaviors exhibited by Katniss are the result of understanding that the rulers of dist. 13 are as brutal and power mad as those of the capitol, to lapse into a state of anxiety and paranoia would be understandable, she is a young person who has existed in survival mode for much too long. I also feel the epilogue does resolve the emotional aspect of the story in the context that it should. Katniss has been through hell with a small circle of people that she cares about she hasn't really considered romance to this point but again when trying to survive a normal development is not a realistic expectation. I for one saw the separation between Gale and Katniss long before the epilogue as they have developed very different philosophies. Katniss's realization that Peeta was the person she loved and whose love made her a better person was subtly stated. Sometimes that is how emotions develop, they just become understood. It may not be romantic but it is real. Comments are also made about her not having children for years, only doing so because Peeta wants children and then not feeling anything for her children. She clearly states that she constantly dreads the loss of what is precious to her which is an expression of love; if you don't care about someone you don't worry about losing them. It is also well established that both she and Peter suffer from their experiences years later, hesitating to procreate is understandable.  Her sentiments toward bringing children into the world are mentioned a number of times in the first two books, the fact that she does have children is an expression of hope; that there will be a future of worth. Peeta and Katniss are two individuals who are damaged and are continuing their lives as best as they can in a new society that is described as one in transformation sans the Hunger Games. So overall you have a portrait of the damage war inflicts, the pain that is never resolved, and the perseverance it takes to survive and rebuild while carrying wounds that cannot ever heal.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game. it is easy to play and so much fun! I play it with my daughter and she likes to play it too.
B003EYVXT6|3.0|I bought this on my B-day on a whim just wanting to see some decent sci-fi, I got my copy from Target. I don't care for the cast, but do like the basic story and just enjoy the strange aspects of the plot. So it's just decent, nothing great. Scientists in a relationship, working together so synthesize a hybrid life form for scientific exploitations.
B0054U53WG|4.0|Subtitled _How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives_ this is basically the biography of a company. Right from Google's creation and through to the failure of Buzz with all the highs and lows in between.<br /><br />Since Google is a company of the internet age there were areas where I skimmed, thinking that I knew all about this. More interesting to me was the behind the scenes information. It was interesting to see how the the viewpoints of senior Googlers differed from the common interpretation of their actions.<br /><br />The section on China was particularly revealing with lots of description of the friction and disagreements within Google itself about whether to engage with China and when to pull out.<br /><br />Another bit of particular interest to me was comparing the struggle that Google had once it became an established tech giant and the struggles the Obama administration had.<br /><br />In both cases idealism and a certain naivety came into hard conflict with entrenched interests. And both groups discovered that while the facts are indeed the facts. The facts won't stop people from misinterpreting everything you do and seeing the worst in you.<br /><br />I've always had a soft spot for Google and tend to think that at lot of the criticisms levied against them are rather ignorant or fail to recognize the realities of the world. This book reinforced that belief.<br /><br />It is a bit of a dry read. Perhaps because the people are secondary to the company in the story of Google. It took me a while to read because I found it easier to dip in and out than to read whole chapters at a time. But it is fact with insight.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|There are few musicals that I actually life enough to buy and having already owned the dvd special edition I still had to buy this HD version. It's worth it. The tale of Sweeney Todd is such an odd story, and the fact that it's a musical makes it all the more entertaining, disturbing and strangely horrific. The cast doesn't sing that well, but the overall effect of the film is quite superb. It's a tale of corruption, betrayal and ultimate blindly maniacal revenge. One monster of a man, turns an innocent man into and even more brutal destructive force renaming himself Sweeney Todd.<br /><br />If you don't like musicals at all avoid this, but if you like horror you might override that notion and find other aspects to enjoy on a darker sadistically cynical level.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I was almost turned off at the beginning of this movie. I don't care how good technology has gotten, you CANNOT put ashes back together. And what a lucky coincidence that all the ashes just happened to scan into the computer right-side-up! Even better that the first two words they just happened to manage to put together were the numbers 822 and the French word for train, so they could figure out where Angelina's character, Elise, was going. After all, they didn't really need to know the rest of the message until later! Well, I am a big fan of Angelina Jolie, so of course I kept watching, and the movie was much better from that point on.<br /><br />This was a pretty interesting role for Johnny Depp. He usually does such weird stuff, and Frank had to be his most normal character ever. It was actually WEIRD to see him playing someone so normal! Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie were a decent match, although I was never really sure what Frank saw in Elise besides the fact that she was gorgeous.<br /><br />And of course the scenery was beautiful. I totally wanted to go back to Venice after watching the movie. (If only I could stay in one of those hotels instead of a group hostel!) It is one of the most gorgeous cities in the world and absolutely the most unique.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|One of my favorite Blu-ray purchases. The movie is a classic in so many ways and holds up after all these years. It lives up to it's title, a true psycho killer classic that set new standards in film soundtrack/scoring, cinematography and overall suspense. Undeniable style and one of Hitchcock's best.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|So everyone's complaining that you &quot;shouldn't get this for a child&quot;. That's not always true. My 2 yr old cousin loves this game and she comes to ASK MY PERMISSION before she hits ok. It's Not TeamLava's fault, maybe your kid's just irresponsible and care free. Anyway, this game is awesome. You get to name your restaurant and give it a personal design. I mean, sure, maybe it is a little hard to earn coins but, deal with it, it's worth it.<br /><br />  ~Utada Yuki

B004SCN2F6|5.0|There are infinite possibilities in this addictive game! It's one of those games you'll find yourself playing for hours &quot;just to do one more thing.&quot; It took me a couple of (briefly alive) practice characters to get the hang of it, but now it's quite intuitive. Good developers, lots of updates; I recommend supporting them with your purchase.

B0059XTUXQ|4.0|Meryl Streep certainly deserved the Best Actress Oscar for her remarkable performance as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in THE IRON LADY, as did make-up artists Mark Coulier and J. Roy Helland for their work on the production.  Indeed, when she is playing the elderly Thatcher, if you didn't know that was Meryl Streep up on the screen, you wouldn't know that was Meryl Streep up on the screen.<br /><br />Sadly, Streep's performance is really the only reason the see this 2011release, because the movie itself is rather dull.<br /><br />The problem lies in its approach to the material.  The story is told in flashbacks, which can often work, but in this instance director Phyllida Lloyd and screenwriter Abi Morgan have chosen to spend far more screen time with the aged, delusional Thatcher ,  having conversations with her late husband (Jim Broadbent), rather than focusing on her political career, which would have been far more interesting.<br /><br />Broadbent and all of the other actors, particularly Alexandra Roach and Harry Lloyd, playing the younger versions of Streep and Broadbent, are exceptional, but a film that prefers to concentrate on the framing story undercuts them all.<br /><br />I would have liked to have learned a lot more about Margaret Thatcher than I did from this picture.<br /><br />THE IRON LADY has been released in a 3-disc Blu-Ray Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment.  Extras include many \\"Making of\\" featurettes that are enhanced with interviews with the actors and filmmakers.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman

0439023521|5.0|I never thought that I would like a books series as much as I loved the Harry Potter series, but that was before I read the Hunger Games. It has a wonderful plot, very well written, and has amazing charcters. It is about a country called Panem that used to be the United States of America which was spilt up in the 13 Districts and the Capitol that ruled over them. At one point the Districts rose up against the Capitol, the Capitol bombed District 13 to the ground and to put the Districts in their place they said that once a year each District had to send one boy and one girl between the ages 12-18 that are called Tributes so they can throw them into an arena where they are forced to fight to the death until one person is left alive. It has been 74 years since they started the Hunger Games and the stories centers around a 16 year old girl from District 12 named Katniss Everdeen who became the Tribute to keep her sister from the Hunger Games. Katniss is an amazing young woman that is brave, strong, and caring which is something rare for the heroine of a YA novel to have all at once. The supporting cast is just as good. If you are looking for a good book that you can lose yourself in, the Hunger Games is it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love the game. The only change I would make is having an indicator when there are no more possible moves left like with most computer versions.
B006W5JF9Y|4.0|Some interesting, some great. Genius resonates with all generations and Dylan's ability to be reinterpreted is another indication of his genius. Been a fan since 1963...not into much of his last 25 year stuff but still appreciate his enigma.

B0076NAWWA|5.0|A fascinating fusion of old and new ideas moving toward popular music but retaining allegiance to raw talent and creative frontiers.<br /><br />There is recognizeable input from all artists on this compilation. Neal Morse, Mike Portnoy, Steve Morse,and Mcpherson inject their legacy feel as well as exploratory input flavored by artists that have influenced them and admittedly admired. Steve Morse sounds like the Morse of old -Dixie Dregs (What If), I suspect Portnoy is responsible for the hints of Queen-Muse-Radiohead-The Beatles and on and on.<br /><br />Flying Colors is a stroll through the past and venture into the future and will appeal to a variety of listeners. Each song offers a unique direction and plenty of material that you will want to listen to more than once.<br /><br />As these guys age, adult twists and turns have found their way into the emotions of these songs without loosing youths' pizazz !<br /><br />Kudos guys-Love it!
B004LUS390|5.0|I was reluctant to purchase this program after reading many reviews that said it no longer worked with the Kindle Fire after a buggy software update. Well the problem seems to have been resolved with the newest 1.3.6 version software. I've been using it for a couple of hours now with no problems. I can't believe this program is only $1.99! Great full featured app! Now all I need is a good stylus.

0307352145|3.0|What did I expect? Quiet by Susan Cain was billed as a series of stories of the impact that Introverts made in our society. She worked twenty years on this book, and it shows by her in-depth research. But it was more like a scientific study--brittle--and I truly struggled to read this.<br /><br />The reason I rated it three stars and not two, or even one is because of the research. But how much scientific research does one want to read about the subject? Give me more about Rosa Parks or Tony Robbins. Don't tell me why we are introverted or what people have discovered about group studies versus individual studies--tell me about the impact past introverts have made in history.<br /><br />I am both an introvert and an extrovert. There are disadvantages to both. No one group is better than the other. In fact, it's not a bad idea for introverts to learn how to overcome their shortcomings in order to reach another person one-on-one. It's also not a bad idea for extroverts to learn how to be quiet. The truth is I didn't like this book. The way it was organized with an introduction that was too long peppered by unnecessary footnotes made reading this book a real struggle. In fact, so much so that I didn't finish it.<br /><br />I snapped it shut and threw the book on the side table. \\"I'm done. I can't finish it.\\" I announced to my husband. If she were to do a speaking tour on this book, I might be interested, but reading an entire scientific study-like book on introverts is more than I can handle. Tell me about the people and the differences they made as introverts. Don't tell me about Dr. So-So who discovered that group study influence was bad.<br /><br />I hated group study as a child. In fact, I volunteered to do all the work in the group study so I wouldn't have to work in a group. Our teacher caught on and gave me an A, then failed the rest of the group in the assignment. I fought it, asking for at least a C for them and me to get a B. I was very young, and ethics wasn't a word I knew very well at that age.<br /><br />Now I have learned how to work in a group when I have to, but I'm certainly no fan of group work. In the real world, introverts have to learn how to work with extroverts. Like Susan said of Rosa Parks; if not for Martin Luther King, Jr. and the extroverts who congregated in that tiny church to protest the arrest, Rosa Parks' quiet dignity may have remained silent. But because of extroverts we hear about stories of introverts who made a difference while using their skill sets. I am giving my copy of this book to an introverted friend who first expressed interest in it when I posted the cover on my website. I hope she gets more out of this than I.<br /><br />*Book given by Waterbrook-Multinomah to reviewt a word I knew very well at that age.<br /><br />Now I have learned how to work in a group when I have to, but I'm certainly no fan of group work.

B004RKXNDU|3.0|This is an interesting look into the spy world, but as expected, very confusing and hard to follow.  I will definitely see the movie in the hope that I will better understand the book. This is a bit of a reversal for me - I usually read the book for clarity and thoroughness and then see the film hoping that it will live up to the book.
B005I4JG80|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this. I would have given it 5 stars, but the authors own dislike of the French and BS American superiority came through way too often for my taste. However, the actual information and stories in the book were quite fascinating. I'm glad the author listed all her references so one could look up each study or book she talked about, and I suggest people actually read some of those. A definite must read for parents or parents to be, or even just people who are interested in this subject.
B0074EIQQU|5.0|The Mars Volta is one of the few bands that somehow manages to cover different musical territory with each subsequent album and yet still makes music that undoubtedly sounds like The Mars Volta.  This time around, \\"Noctourniquet\\" finds them rocking harder than they did on their last effort while looking towards the past for inspiration, namely towards electronic beats and synthesizers that recall other bands yet still push the music in a decidedly Mars Volta direction.<br />  Take opener \\"The Whip Hand\\", for instance.  Absent Cedric's distinctive voice, this track could easily find itself a home on a Nine Inch Nails album.  Progressive rock meets industrial rock and the results are exhilarating. \\"Aegis\\" follows, which opens with a Radiohead-esque guitar intro (think \\"Creep\\") and active percussion not too far removed from Radiohead's more recent endeavors.  In fact, several tracks on the album- \\"Empty Vessels Make the Loudest Sound\\", \\"In Absentia\\", \\"Zed and Two Naughts\\"- are laced with healthy doses of electronica that result in what sounds like a collaboration between The Mars Volta and Reznor, Yorke, possibly even Jourgensen and Ministry.  The title track even throws in some '80s sounding synth that evokes images of cheesy dance moves and bad hair, while \\"Lapochka\\" throws in some sweet Beach Boy sounding harmonies.  Still, throughout it all, the music is undoubtedly The Mars Volta, full of unexpected time signatures and enigmatic lyrics.<br />  Several tracks stand-out as some of the best this band has done.  \\"The Malkin Jewel\\" could be a Meat Puppets song as covered by Modest Mouse- quirky, jammy, loose, and weird in a manner TMV does not normally do.  \\"Trinkets Pale of Moon\\", one of three ballads on the album, steps into creepy territory thanks to eerie chanting in the background that harkens back to the seance-inspired tracks of \\"Amputechture\\"; and \\"Molochwalker\\" is TMV at its intense best- three and half minutes of no-holds barred, pedal to the metal energy!<br />  Fans who still think \\"De-loused in the Comatorium\\" is their only great album may once again be disappointed as this is not that album.  Those of us who have rolled with TMV's numerous musical detours should enjoy \\"Noctourniquet\\" as it once again finds the band taking chances and exploring new musical direction.  Also, it's length is close to an hour so once again, they are giving us a lot of music to soak in and enjoy.  So please, enjoy!/>  Fans who still think \\"De-loused in the Comatorium\\" is their only great album may once again be disappointed as this is not that album.

B005CGI3ZG|5.0|GREAT COLLECTION! The music is fine and just as I remembered it, with a few exceptions. I don't care for the box, as you kind of have to lay the dvds out one by one to keep track, but not a reason to give anything less than 5 stars. If you want the complete collection of Dawson's Creek, then this is the way to go.

B0072GPQNG|4.0|\\"Don't worry mom, I'll raise him. I'll raise him good.\\" After a war of ego's is won by Albert's dad the family is an owner of a young skinny horse. Albert saves the horse and trains it and the two become best friends. After a rain ruins the families crop Albert's father is forced to sell the horse to war effort in order to save the families farm. When the horse is put into battle in France his travels begin. This was a movie I was actually looking forward to mainly because it was a Spielberg movie. I really did end up liking it quite a bit. The movie reminded me of \\"Australia\\" in the way that it felt like two movies. The first half was the bonding of the boy and his horse and the second an action filled war movie. I really enjoyed that and it made it feel shorter then it was. For those worried about this being like \\"In Pursuit Of Honor\\" I have to say that there is really no horse abuse in this at all so it's OK to watch this. Much like any Spielberg movie it is very entertaining and classy, but for me at least this is a one time watch. Overall, a very good movie that is very much worth seeing. I give it a B+.
B002E01MI8|5.0|If I had to think of the perfect example of the giallo genre of Italian horror/suspense movies, I'd say it's got to be 'The New York Ripper', original title 'Lo squartatore di New York'. Misogynistic, dark and grisly - the low-budget video nasty is about a killer with a Daffy Duck voice slashing up women in the city and the prostitute-visiting detectives trying to track him down. Lucio Fulci, known affectionately as the \\"Godfather of Gore\\" by us horror freaks, can always be counted on to serve up the sex and blood like antipasto. The on-location setting, 1980-1981 pre-Giuliani Times Square sex and seediness, only adds to the dark grittiness of it all. One personal favorite scene of mine involves two Hispanic punks and a very, ahem...disturbed woman in a grimy bar.<br /><br />'New York Ripper' is old-school exploitation and divine late night fun for gorehounds.

0792843584|5.0|If Heaven's Gate had been produced as a mini-series (think Lonesome Dove) we might be talking here about the Citizen Kane of Westerns; as it is, there are just too many gaps and fragments to think of this film as a completed work. And by gaps I don't mean missing bits of the narrative (a problem many people have with HG) but rather thematic fissures that give the political and emotional aspects of the film an unfinished feeling.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a good many of the fragments in HG are absolutely amazing, starting with the valedictory sequence at the beginning of the film, which, in about 4 minutes running screen time, pretty much sums up the last 2,000 years of our political history. As that scene points out, the problem isn't that the wealthy and powerful aren't human; the problem is that there is so little opportunity in the lives of such people for that humanity to be expressed.<br /><br />And there are many other extraordinary moments in this film. My suggestion is to watch it, draw the inevitable conclusions about the futility of \\"reforming\\" our politics, and then...sign up for the revolution.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Enjoyable and can be challenging.  I like that it's simple to play but it's still fun and uses your brain a bit too.  Well done.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|Movie: Full of excellent performances, this story is complex, yet simply and clearly told. The pacing is perfect, and the already excellent script is brought to life beautifully by director David Fincher. 10/10.<br /><br />Video: Criterion is known for stunning, true-to-filmmaker-intent video transfers, and this is no exception. Shot digitally, this movie shows none of that artificial digital flatness, and feature perfect contrast and outstanding color reproduction. The whole thing is razor-sharp, but naturally so, giving an incredibly lifelike image. 10/10.<br /><br />Audio: The sound design, like that of all David Fincher films, is incredible, and this DTS-HD MA 5.1 track (I don't know why the cover says \\"Dolby Digital 5.1,\\" but rest assured it is actually a DTS-HD Master Audio track) reproduces it wonderfully. The sound here is clear and enveloping, with perfect LFE output and surround activity. Dialogue and music are well-prioritized. 10/10.<br /><br />Special Features: Criterion and David Fincher are both known for providing a wealth of special feature on their releases, and so it is no surprise that release features just that. A massive ammount of special features, all of which are informative and interesting. 10/10.<br /><br />Overall: Yeah. Perfect. 10/10.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book grabbed me and sucked me in from the beginning.  I bought the omnibus version that contained all 5 books of the story and I am so glad because I tore through the whole thing in a matter of a couple of days.  I  stayed up until after midnight and until my eyes could no longer stay open.  The character developement was amazing and the story was really exciting.  It was sci-fi, but realistic sci-fi.  I wish my words could do this story justice.  I'm off now to find more books by this author.  Buy it--you will not be sorry.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|Movie: After a somewhat awkward first act, the movie comes alive with excellent action, emotional and heartfelt, if ever-so-slightly flawed, storytelling, and a surprisingly dense thematic nature. 8/10.<br /><br />Video: Without any trace of DNR or edge-enhancement, this is one of the most lifelike transfers I've yet seen, with colors that are wonderfully saturated without being overdone, and perfect contrast--which at times may seem a tad high, but this is inherent to the source material, and not a flaw in the transfer. 10/10.<br /><br />Audio: As expected from a movie that won an Oscar for sound design, this DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio track is flawless. Every sound is completely--and I know I'm using this word a lot--lifelike, making excellent use of the surrounds, be it for subtle ambience or loud action-oriented effects. Music and dialogue are perfectly prioritized, never lost in the frenzy of wild action sequences. 10/10.<br /><br />Special Features: It's somewhat lacking in the special feature department. Ah, well. 5/10.<br /><br />Overall: An underrated action-drama is brought to life with wonderful clarity, via flawless 1080p video and DTS-HD MA audio. Features are slight, but it's far from a deal-breaker. 9/10.
B0071MV540|1.0|figured we wanted a chuckle or two and some mindless entertainment for a friday night. This movie is surprisingly bad. terrible dialogue, implausible plot, and a complete waste of talent. I read the poor reviews when the movie came out so was not going to pay theater prices - but not even worth $3. Had more laughs the next day mocking the plot and mimicking the ridiculous dialogue than actually watching the movie.
0805091742|5.0|A well designed checklist does two things. First it keeps a team from missing vital but routine tasks, tasks that are so important that one assumes they have been already carried out. When everyone thinks someone must have done something already, it's easy to imagine that this something could have been forgotten!<br /><br />A second purpose of checklists is to build a team spirit. By assigning the checklist to a specific person and having different tasks verified by different members of the team, the resulting communications invariably lead to more information being shared among the entire team.<br /><br />What makes the book great is the emphasis it places on the importance of designing the checklist. Even experts will need several attempts before they get their checklist right. Further, proven and tested checklists are not static boilerplate templates. Each organization needs to tweak its checklists to fit its culture. Checklist are not exhaustive itemized procedures.<br /><br />Some people complain the book is padded while others complain that it is too narrow. It is neither.<br /><br />It's about the importance and benefits of checklists in general, it's about how they first appeared in aviation before spreading to other fields, and it's about the difficulty of getting them accepted by the people who should use them.<br /><br />Gawande says a lot in a short space; any reader will get his full message in the two hours it takes to read the book. Hardly the stuff of padding.<br /><br />Nor is the book focused on the medical industry. Because the author is a surgeon, he naturally illustrates his general idea with examples from medecine.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is one of the saddest books I have read, yet I couldn't put it down. With N Korea in the news fairly often, this book will give you a little insight into the regime and how inhumane it is. His story is amazing yet difficult to fully grasp and understand as there is little to no common points of reference. After every chapter I find myself praying for this guy.

The drumming is excellent too. Normally I am not a big thrash metal person but there is just something special about these guys. All the songs are great but my favorite tracks would have to be 21st Century Man and Good Night!!!!!
0470449764|1.0|I studied this entire book, sat for the GMAT and did absolutely terrible.  I don't think this book covered even a single question that the GMAT exam actually asked me.  Going into the exam I felt prepared and thought as though I would do well on this portion of the test, nope, this review guide didn't prepare me at all for the type of quantitative questions that were asked.

140053271X|5.0|Before I purchased my eReader, I did a ton of research and, for a time, I actually ended up owning both devices - the Nook Simple Touch and the Kindle Touch with 3G. Here is my comparison.<br /><br />There are many things that I prefer on the Nook over the Kindle.<br />- Nook has page scroll buttons so that I don't have to touch (and smudge-up) the screen each time I turn the page<br />- Though both eReaders advertise a battery life of two months, Kindle's is based on 30 minutes of use per day; the Nook's is based on 1-hour of use. In other words, the Nook's battery life lasts TWICE AS LONG.<br />- The layout of the device software on the Nook is more user-friendly with the Nook. For example, the Nook has a home-page and a very simple menu to orient yourself between different screens. Using the Kindle, on the other hand, I always felt slightly disoriented, though I am sure many Kindle-users would tell you otherwise.<br /><br />There are also several things I preferred on the Kindle over the Nook.<br />- The casing of the Kindle is better and has a better feel. This was not a big deal for me because I have a skin for my Nook - one of the colored ones BN sells.<br />- The Kindle Touch can come with 3G. There are two reasons I am really happy using a Nook, even though it doesn't have 3G. (1) I have wireless internet at my house. (2) Even if I didn't, I could still buy books for the Google eBookstore at Google Play using a computer with an internet conection.<br /><br />Other things to consider:<br />- Will you be reading books or daily publications more? A daily publication requires a constant source to internet. A 3G network might be really important if you want the daily newspaper.<br />- With the Nook, you are able to read books or documents in the epub or pdf format. This means that you can purchase books from BN, google, and many other internet bookstores (ie. More competition). With the Kindle, you will, almost definitely, only be purchasing products from Amazon.BN (Nook) book prices tend to be higher than Amazon (Kindle). Amazon (Kindle) book prices about the same as Google (Nook).<br /><br />In the end, I felt that the Nook Simple Touch was a better purchase and a better device that was more intuitive to use and had to be charged much less frequently. I returned the Kindle.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|After hearing a little about the book being described as an \\"adult version of Twilight\\" and \\"mommy porn\\" I decided to pick it up to see what the fuss was all about. A little over two weeks later I have read all three books twice through and have enjoyed every minute of it. Yes, there is a lot of \\"adult content\\" in each of the books, but looking beyond that, the story captured me at the beginning and held my attention throughout. After reading each book through the first time (in 4 days) I was so attached to the two main characters that I just had to go back to read them all again. It was just as enjoyable the second time around. I really enjoyed the \\"Twilight\\" series and fell in love with this series the same way! I do not read a lot, but found this book to be a quick and easy read.

B000IJ79V6|5.0|11/7/2016-'superman part 2' is actually a 2 part movie. what i mean by that is this movie was filmed in 2 parts. in 1977, the first half was made back to back with 'superman part 1'. but in the fall of that year, production of 'part 2' was halted because of budget cuts and production scheduling was trailing behind. the original director also known as 'the original richard' richard donner was fired. so, the studios decided 2 finish filming 'part 1'.  filming on the second half of 'part 2' would not begin until june 1979. by then, a second 'richard' would finish making the film. this new director, richard lester, began finishing the film from 1979 to the early part of 1980. the movie was then theatrically released later that year internationally. however, the film would not be released in the united states until 1981. now, as far as the actual age of this film, since production began in '77, that means the movie was in quotes 'born' that year. so, the film with 'superman part 1', will turn 40 years old this coming spring 2017. i was finally able to purchase the extended tv version on d.v.d from 'ioffer.com'. it is much better than the theatrical version. i also have 'the richard donner cut' which was also better.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|Okay, so my older son is a die-hard Muppet fanatic and he always has been. Needless to say, he was ecstatic the first night the movie came out in theaters, and just as much so when it came out on DVD. Me and my husband grew up on the Muppets as well, so we were excited for the grand revival of this great franchise.<br /><br />This movie is amazing. It's funny, it's heart-warming, and it reminds us all why the Muppets were the international superstars they were, and are becoming again. My word, Jason Segel did an amazing job. There are no faults whatsoever in this movie. My son, now 16, bought the movie and watched it as soon as he got home from the store in our family room.<br /><br />I have two little ones as well, one 7 and one 5. Both have pretty severe special needs which cause them to be unable to sit through a full-length movie without losing control. They grew up without the Muppets, and it was amazing to see what happened when they walked into the family room and sat down on the couch in front of the television.<br /><br />They were entranced. They sat through the entire film, then asked to watch it again once it was done. I figured, hey it was awesome to find something to keep them entertained for a bit while I could get some housework done. Little did I know how big of an impact the movie would make on my kids.<br /><br />I was in the kitchen one day and I overhear in the family room my little 5-year-old's voice: \\"It's time to play the music, it's time to light the lights...\\" She was singing the Muppet Show theme song, which was re-created for this movie. She wasn't watching the movie at the time, but while she was playing with dolls she was singing the unmistakable tune. It hit me how big of an impact they were making on my kids, just as much as they had made for me. I used to sing that song while I was playing, back when the Muppet Show was a huge weekly phenomenon.<br /><br />We were watching the movie the next night, and I asked my 7-year-old son, \\"What's your favorite character?\\" Up until the movie came out, if a child was interested in the Muppets at all, they would probbly answer with the basics (Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie...). However, my son answered \\"Deadly.\\" Deadly is the gloomin evil assistant to the villain in the film, who eventually turns to the good side at the end of the film (sorry for the spoilers). Deadly was first introduced as a supporting player in The Muppet Show and wasn't seen since then up until this movie. The fact that my son chose him (His reason: \\"He turned bad to good.\\") is an amazing thing o view, seeing as I grew up with characters like Deadly. They were all back, looking great, with new voices (from past puppeteers who have retired or passed on...) and thriving as ever. It was a beautiful thing to hear.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, this movie is great. If you have little kids who have not grown up with the Muppets, get this movie. The Muppets area timeless group of entertainers who can keep an adult just as well as a kid entertained and satisfied as the credits roll.<br /><br />Get the movie. You will be glad you did.

B00756GKBA|1.0|I grew up with Madonna!  Played 'Borderline' on my casette boombox, LOL!  Loved her especially thru MUSIC and RAY OF LIGHT.  Ironically, SHE has not stayed with her origianl fans...  The trendy club beats and trite lyrics (A long way from LIKE A PRAYER and PAPA DON'T PREACH!) are so painfully desparate pandering to the \\"20-something-rich&famous-for-nothing-bump-'n-grind-on-the-dance-floor-look-at-me-crowd\\".  Oh, that's right, she wants to be a \\"cool\\" parent for her tween!!  I really wanted to love this album but it was AWFUL in every way.  Boring vocals (pah-leeez, listen to Florence and you can't help but be critical of M).  Uninspired lyrics if not completely MINDLESS!  (Maybe her daughter wrote them?)  Finally, the music!  If you love techno club house music, then this will apeal to you. As your life long fan you let us down... I was looking for Music! For someone who could surround herself with world class producers and the best artists money can buy...THIS IS ALL YOU GOT????  The album actually left me confused.  At the end she teases us with a beautiful ballad \\"Masterpiece\\".  That song doesn't even belong with that other GARBAGE!  M, you are better than this!!!  WHY???  Get rid of your 'yes men', and realize that 50 is not the new 20.  I can only hope you go retro for the concert tickets I purchased, with yes, all my pennies!!!  WTH? :(

The picture was horrible the film grain was worse than the Zapurter film!<br /><br />If that wasn't bad enough the sound wasn't any good either and for good measure the DVD locked up on me but only<br />once!<br /><br />I played the regular DVD right after watching the Blu Ray and without question the quality is MUCH better. The picture isn't anywhere near as grainy, the contrast is much better and the sound is better. I haven't been this disappointed over the tranfer of a Blu Ray Dvd since Die Hard.<br /><br />Buy the regular version and stay away from this piece of gargabe.

B0051T47NQ|3.0|The idea of this movie is interesting, these college kids are following someone they think is a bear poacher, um no, that's not what he does and they find that out. The man decides to let them follow and film him. I gotta say some of this movie in the beginning is boring, takes awhile to get started but over all it wasn't a bad film, it wasn't gory, so if you gore hounds out there are looking for it, this isn't it, but the movie has a story so if you're a fan of that then check it out.
B0030IIZ1A|5.0|I am very happy with my order and video! The product came earlier than expected which was a nice surprise. :)
B006JTS5OO|1.0|I grew up with the Muppets, and I loved this movie in the theaters.<br /><br />The one star is for the fact that the digital copy is useless.  I know that movie studios are trying to crack down on piracy, so the digital copy here isn't a huge file that you download and can just give someone else for free.  Older Blu Ray discs like _Kick Ass_ and _The Town_ offered digital copies like this.<br /><br />Instead, what you get is the right to stream the movie from Disney's website.  To me, this is absolutely useless because I want a digital copy so I can watch the movie on a device without anything else necessary.  No disc, no Internet connection, nothing.  Isn't that what it's supposed to mean?  I use digital copies to watch the movie on my iPad2, for example, when I'm on an airplane flight.  That's sort of the point of a portable, digital copy.<br /><br />Now, you *have* to have an Internet connection, which means that 1) you could be already near a device with a disc reader, 2) Disney's website could control the transmission bitrate and thus the movie's video quality, 3) you might have to eat into your device's data usage plan (and movies aren't exactly conservative on bandwidth usage), or 4) you might have to PAY MONEY on a plane for Wi-Fi to watch a digital copy that you supposedly paid for already.<br /><br />So my suggestion is that you buy the Blu Ray/DVD combo, unless you want the soundtrack for the price difference.  At least I got the soundtrack.  The movie industry needs to deal with piracy in another way, IMHO.<br />-d

B007JRU2UK|4.0|Please note that I saw this movie on TV so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer or its features.<br /><br />I had high expectations for this movie, and having finally seen it myself, I have to say it's definitely a good movie, but it's not a great movie either. I did enjoy the film, and it's certainly another more than competent effort from director Alexander Payne (\\"Election,\\" \\"About Schmidt,\\" \\"Sideways\\") who hasn't disappointed yet. But I have to wonder at the movie's stellar reputation which doesn't seem to me to live up to all the hype. This is why I rate it four stars instead of five.<br /><br />All that having been said, I think the most interesting question here, given all the glowingly positive reviews and the very few negative ones, is why the movie seems to have struck such a responsive chord with the viewing public. And I think I have as good a theory as any about that. As hundreds of reviewers have already commented on the usual movie topics such as the acting, direction, script, plot, and so on, I'll mainly discuss this idea since I've read quite a few of the reviews here and I didn't see anyone else discuss this so far.<br /><br />The movie starts with  a voice-over of Clooney musing about \\"life in paradise\\" and wondering how people can think it's any different from anywhere else--people are the same, they have all the same problems--the only difference is that in Hawaii they have them in paradise. Clooney comments that people seem to think Hawaiians just sit on the beach or surf and drink mai tai's all day long, and that life is always idyllic.  \\"Are they insane?\\" Clooney asks. LOL<br /><br />And I think that right there sums up the appeal of this movie. The Germans have a word, \\"schadenfreude,\\" which means \\"taking pleasure in the suffering of others.\\" And I think the appeal of this movie has exactly to do with that. I suspect Americans in general envy those who get to live in Hawaii, and this story about a dysfunctional family and the tragic situation which the family has to deal with, all set against the backdrop of the beautiful Hawaiian landscape, appealed to the public by showing that people in Hawaii can be just as miserable, and their lives can be just as screwed up, as everywhere else.<br /><br />In the case of Clooney's family, they might live in a natural paradise, but his family life is anything but. The kids are insolent and disobedient, use foul language inappropriate to children, court the wrong friends (mainly Alex, the teenage daughter, whose current flame is an oafish boor), and are in general constantly misbehaving and disrespectful of Clooney, the hapless father, who's just trying to get everyone through a very stressful and difficult time for the family.<br /><br />Yup, it's not exactly paradise; in fact, if you take away the location, it's more like hell: Clooney is miserable, the kids are miserable, the relatives are just lazing about hoping to cash in on Clooney's land deal, (spoiler alert!) his wife is dying, and on top of all this, Clooney finds out that his wife was cheating on him before she had her fatal boating accident. Oh, and did I mention the father-in-law has no respect for Clooney either? This is despite the fact that Clooney has a busy career as a lawyer, although he could easily retire if he just sold the huge 25,000 acre parcel of land that the family inherited from the Hawaiian royal family several generations earlier.<br /><br />Well, wives cheat on husbands, husbands cheat on wives, kids are ungrateful and spoiled, and the relatives are often less than stellar representatives of humanity pretty much everywhere. The only difference here is that it's in \\"paradise.\\" In other words, life is pretty unhappy, depressing, and miserable in paradise too--and I think that in a nutshell summarizes the great appeal of this movie--and all the glowingly positive reviews.tragic situation which the family has to deal with, all set against the backdrop of the beautiful Hawaiian landscape, appealed to the public by showing that people in Hawaii can be just as miserable, and their lives can be just as screwed up, as everywhere else.<br /><br />In the case of Clooney's family, they might live in a natural paradise, but his family life is anything but.

B004LROMWU|2.0|Usually i don't like alien invasion stories since there are stereotypical and unsophisticated but i was willing to give this a chance. I was vastly dissapointed. Falling skies is an amalgam af the most clished ideas in science fiction tv (since we saw them many times before). Good heroic humans fight evil aliens. Add to this the unavoidable (these days) family drama between a father and a son, the stereotypical character of a \\"heroic\\" commander and a totally clished aproach to human emotions and you have one of the most boring science fiction tv series of the last 20 years (at least). But ofcourse there is also Terra Nova which is even worst!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started reading this book because of seeing an article about the \\"housewives\\".  I didn't know what to expect, but I've spent the last 5 days reading through the entire series.  I love that an erotica book has made it onto the bestseller list.  Not only does it have a lot of tantalizing scenes that make breathing regularly hard, but the storyline is actually really good. The sexual scenes are written in a real and not cheesy or over the top graphic manner- no bodice ripping or fake quick romance scenes here nor is there the constant dribble that some erotica stories may contain. My fiancee is also praising this book, but not for the literary quality ;)

B005LAIIS0|2.0|I'm a fan of Liam Neeson, and he and the other actors did a fine job here, no qualms there. The problem I had was with the story. It was mostly a character development showcase, and featured very little adventure or action.<br /><br />The characters were being picked off one by one, and surrounded by a huge pack of wolves. They set up a camp fire and for what seemed like the majority of the film, spent time telling crude campfire stories to keep their sanity. With that fire, they could've lit up the forest to keep the wolves at bay, but they were too busy quarreling with each other to consider such options. I found it tough to relate to anyone here but Liam's character.<br /><br />Well acted? Yes. Dramatic film? Yes. Exciting adventure? Hardly until the end, when things picked up pace slightly. It wouldn't be fair to compare this to the other well known forest adventure \\"The Edge\\" with Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin trying to escape a killer Grizzly, but don't go in expecting something similar, and you may very well enjoy this film. Otherwise, heed the warning. This is NOT an adventure movie and wasn't designed as one, as the trailers seemed to have suggested... Very disappointed.<br /><br />STORY: 3/10<br />PACING: 2/10<br />CHARACTERS: 5/10<br />ACTING: 9/10<br />ADVENTURE: 2/10<br />OVERALL: 4/10 is my opinion. Not my style of movie to be fair. Some will love it.

Quirky, sardonic, side-splittingly funny, as well as moving; a plot twist that's perfection.  Terrific acting, including Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. the dog; luminous and magical cinematography.  It's everything I want in a movie.
B00785P2QC|3.0|well I think my title sums it up I'm just writing this so I can get this as. a review this game can be if u use ur money sparingly
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I remember when I first saw the trailer I was like who the F is John Carter? Unfortunately Disney didn't do much to inform me. So one day I decided to do some google research for myself. Since the movie looked good and I love sci-fi, I was slightly interested. I soon found out that this was actually a 100 year old book series that was written by the same dude that wrote Tarzan. Edgar Rice Burroughs. And most sci-fi films including Star Wars and Avatar are ripoffs of these original stories. The more I learned about it (on my own, no thanks to Disney marketing) the more I was interested to see it. I still hated the title though. I figured if I said it, others would also say; Who the F is John Carter? I finally went to see it, and I just loved it. My favorite stand out performance was Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris. Sexy, smart and strong. I'm really happy I didn't heed negative reviews and went to see it. It inspired me to read the original books (100% FREE by the way on Kindle store). [[ASIN:B002RKSDS2 A Princess of Mars]] [[ASIN:B002RKSDRI The Gods of Mars]] [[ASIN:B002RKT02K Warlord of Mars]] [[ASIN:B002RKT01Q Thuvia, Maid of Mars]] [[ASIN:B002RKSVGQ The Chessmen of Mars]]
B006W0QOF2|4.0|Don't let the first 40 minutes of slowness fool you.  Its just character development.  The final hour is fast brutal and intense.  Perlman & Brooks are excellent.  Ryan Gosling is just on that border of creepy & heroic.
B00004W50Z|5.0|A classic.  Bonus tracks of alternate mix and take versions of \\"Daniel And The Sacred Harp\\", \\"Time To Kill\\", and \\"The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show\\" are a nice plus.  The enclosed booklet is incredible with the whole history of this body of work from The Band with details of the various mixes it underwent.  It also profiles the details of individual songs.  Even if you own an original vinyl copy as I do, BUY IT!! You won't be disappointed.  As it is noted at the end of the Producer's Notes, \\"For the first time since the original vinyl release of STAGE FRIGHT, this CD reissue presents the correct mixes as initially intended\\"
159308336X|5.0|Product was exactly as described and in perfect condition.  I bought this to replace a library book that I had ruined and the new one was in much better shape than the one I had borrowed.  I am very very satisfied with the pricing, shipping time and quality of this product.  I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing from this seller!!  Thank you for such a pleasant experience!
0894803123|5.0|The recipes in this book are delicious!  We got a new ice cream maker over the holidays and have made ice cream making a family activity and gift giving event!  These recipes make deliciously creamy, rich ice cream treats and there is enough variety to please everyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm addicted! This is a great app and I enjoy the auto complete. You should definitely get this game today.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the last book in the series and I just have to say it was sad to have reach the end!! It ended great the Author did an amazing job on the last book I just wanted more!! Christian became the man we all knew he could became and it was still as hott as the first book!! Ended with him and his thoughts about his future wife which i thought was a great ending!! Way to go EL James!! Cant wait to see it in theaters!! ;)
B007BLCGNU|2.0|The movie did not give an accurate historical perspective. The movie had a different agenda. The poorest Clint Eastwood picture yet.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read the entire series this is the second book of three and boy was it just as hot and heated as the previous and the one that followed!! Christian is every girls dream man!! Sexy, strong and HOT HOT HOT!! but he has a softer side that he reveals and it just makes you cry and laugh. This is the best series i have read!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was very intrigued by the attention this book was getting and that compelled me to read it.  But I am thanking God, I didn't buy it.  I was very disappointed.  This book was so juvenile.  Others compare it to Stephanie Meyers, but I think they are doing Stephanie a disservice.  What's a real letdown is that the story has all the ingredients to be a really good adventure psychologically and a good sexual romp.  But the author doesn't have the chops to pull it all together and flesh out the characters, the story line or the story TELLING.  I am an avid reader.  I read everything.  So I am trying to cut this author some slack.  If you have never read erotica before, this is an ok jumping off place.  However note that you are starting off at the bottom of the barrel.  If Harlequin is putting out erotica these days, then perhaps they are behind this.  This book was Vanilla.  If you want to read a hard core, well written, sexy novel, try Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty triology.  That is the standard by which to judge all others.  She writes under a pen name A. N. Roquelaure.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|In the mornings I would not get up. Well I kept search for something to wake me in the mornings. And then I found alarm clock extreme free. It works great!!!!!!!!
B0001MDPV8|5.0|I'm gonna pay homage to the Illmatic, well cos' gosh this album is crazy good. All you hip hop listeners I went to high school with and touting today's rappers need to listen to Nas, I'm not gonna force ya change your music choice, but man this record is off-the-hinges. Nas spits magic hip hop flames. I gave \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\" so.. so.. many plays because it knocked my socks off- amazing track. Best rap CD ever.
B005MWPW86|4.0|Gave a greater insight in to the mind of Craig Ferguson. Easy to read with some depressingly low points interspersed among his cynical blend of comedy. Enjoy watching him late night and enjoyed this book.
B001EKSW82|5.0|I really hate snow, but this album makes me want to go into battle in the winter's snow and really kick some.....Amon Amarth always makes me feel like I'm on the battlefield with them with the double bass pounding as horses hooves.
B003O86FMW|2.0|After reading the kindle edition of The Hunger Games in one sitting (considering how gut wrenching, engrossing and well laid-out story it was), I was totally unprepared for the disappointment in the second book.<br /><br />SPOLER ALERT !!!!!!!<br />The  author just wanted to prolong the effect of the Hunger games with the second round of Hunger games which does not make any sense. If the President wanted to finish off Katniss, he could have done this easily (called it accidental death or used some excuse to execute Katniss) instead of giving momentum to the fledgling people's revolution by having the winners (read \\"heroes\\" for the common people)thrown in the arena for a fight to death! Totally bizarre !!<br /><br />Peeta is portrayed as a sappy lap-dog yearning for katniss's love and Gale - not sure whether he is an angry young man or just another limp puppet in the show!.  The annihilation of District 12 doesnt make sense at all as that by itself would have achieved the end result of eliminating Katniss!<br /><br />Poor storyline, too much recap of the first book - a total waste of time and a huge disappointment<br /><br />I am not buying the third book.
B005NPCJ88|3.0|I really think Ivan is truly \\"selling out.\\" I love his bands Motograter and Ghost Machine. The first 5fdp was good but every album coming out now is very mainstream and the lyrics are very weak. The riffs are good on this album but I have to turn it off after a few songs because it sounds like the same thing, over and over with a few different riffs. I don't think I'll be buying anymore 5fdp.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I'm not a fan of angry birds but Mg brother likes it which is y I am downloading my brother is telling me to give the game 5 stars which is exactly wat I am going 2 do
B006TGWY3K|5.0|Lacuna Coil always has pretty good music. Their best album was \\"Comalies\\" but this one isn't bad at all. I tend to have \\"My Spirit\\" and \\" End of Time\\" stuck on repeat. Very nice lyrics and of course Cristina's vocals are always awesome.
1451673442|5.0|I recommend this book strongly. It is an inspiration and makes us realise the importance of being grateful for what we have and thus be more in harmony with ourselves.
B002RCEBBI|4.0|Very lengthy and songs full of orchestra. Good album to listen to on very long trips. Some of the growling is lame but most part this album is good.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|The title of my review says it all! This is wonderful expression of artistry, community, integrity, & mission. Hats off to everyone involved in this project!
B007B6T3K4|4.0|The old Xandria was mediocre with a few good songs. This new album is a refreshing change of pace for this band. Very good instrumentals and a strong singer.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|A great movie and story for kids of all ages.  Fun and entertaining.  What a great character for Carol Burnett, and Aileen Quinn is adorable!  A must see.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|um paid $3 for this and you only get 3 worlds really<br />that's crap. should have been free<br />just beware your better off downloading the free one<br />would be a great game if it had more :(
B0031QVW2U|4.0|The Brad works just like it says it should. One caveat: watch the howto video on the Black Rapid site, illustrating the proper technique attaching it to your strap. It will save you a fair amount of time and frustration. I went ahead and attempted to do so without watching the vid first, and of course, I put it on backwards. Hey, I had a 50/50 chance of putting it on right, didn't I?! If all else fails, follow the instructions.<br /><br />Once attached and adjusted correctly, it works flawlessly as advertised. I would have given it a 5 star rating, but I found it cumbersome to attach the Brad onto the Black Rapid strap initially. If you watch the vid, you'll notice the convenient absence of that part of the setup. Watch the video and get it right the first time so you don't have to dismantle the thing and do it right the second time.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|please this does not really count as a game really it sucks.  please never make a game like this again.  I'm am sorry 4 the mentaly challenged person who could have made this game
B007J4T2G8|3.0|the reader wasn't BOMBARED with tons of \\"Oh my, Oh this, Oh that\\" and \\"Holy cow, Holy this, Holy that\\"  As you can see I'm still reading this book and I'm about half way through it. I'm enjoying the story itself, but all the Oh's and Holy's is just overkill and makes it hard to want to continue reading. I don't know why the author didn't realize this as they wrote the book because by chapter 3 or 4, I immediately wondered, how many times am I going to see the words Oh and Holy? In most cases the story is better if you skip over them and that's what I've started doing. Due to this I've not decided if I'll invest in the 2nd and 3rd installments---just afraid they will be riddled with more of these words or other repeatitive words. One thing I'd like to add is I saw on (I believe) G.M.A one morning and they were going on and on about this book. How thousands of copies have already been downloaded and how some women even claim it has helped their relationship/marriage. So. I was kinda riding the hype wagon and so far have been a little disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|all you people judging by reviews of book STOP half of the bad reviews in this book are people trying to act as if their so knowledgeable about books. thinking that if they go against the world on reviews about this thinking they will be like a critic ok. its a great book a true adventure and a raw thrilling page turner. If YOU WANT A good book read the whole seris its great!!!
B003Y5HWGI|1.0|We own all the Desperate Housewives seasons on DVD. We have always been very happy with them and they have provided a lot of entertainment during our expat assignments. (We're currently living in Russia.) We've never had any issues with them until this evening. We are on the seventh season and had just finished watching the last episode from Disc 4. I changed DVDs, and put in Disc 5. However, when the menu came up, it still showed Season 7, Disc 4 on the mailbox on the menu screen. Thinking something was odd, I took out the Disc and tried again, but with the same result. After again verifying that I had put in the Disc 5 DVD, the Disc 4 menu came up. I tried this at least 6 times as I was shocked that there could be an error this big with the DVDs. I even tried it on my iMac to double-check. Unfortunately, Disc 4 and Disc 5 have the EXACT same menu and episodes on them. Even though Disc 5 is labeled as such, it does not contain episodes 20-23. My husband and I are still surprised that this could happen. I'm really not sure what to do at this point. I would like to get the correct Disc 5.<br /><br />(If you're curious, I am tech-savvy as I am a computer programmer.)
0316098329|5.0|Haunting, beautiful and well worth a read (or two!)<br /><br />I have never read anything else by Emma Donoghue, but having been given this book I will surely pick up something else of hers next time I'm book-shopping. Perfectly written.
B0031RAOVY|2.0|I was really disappointed with this movie.  I like the Japanese tale much better.<br /><br />This movie was not about loyalty, it was about not being able to let go or move on.  Ten years later the wife comes back to the same small town to visit, and she looks like hell,  still as depressed as the day her husband died.  Why hadn't she tried to move forward in her life?  The dog got older and more beaten down as the years passed him by.<br /><br />Loyalty is one thing, but living in the past is another.  Could have been so much more.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|Let me start by saying I don't see OpenFeint anywhere on this game.  I don't get the login screen when I open it, so I'm not sure what people are complaining about there.<br /><br />This is a simple game at first blush, but it's actually pretty challenging to try to figure the best combination of moves to successfully complete each level.  It's cute and addictive and a great way to pass the time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a fun app to keep you busy and pass the time! very easy to play the games and earn lots of points!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|My wife and I watched \\"John Carter\\" and \\"Hunger Games\\" in the theater the same day.  I had read the Barsoom series in high school in the 1960s, and she was nearly through the \\"Hunger Games\\" books. We both liked \\"John Carter\\" better as a movie, and chose to go watch it again as soon as we could.  There are differences from the book -- the Therns in particular right off, but I consider that an acceptable \\"update\\" in view of what we have come to expect of sci-fi since 1917. The CGI creatures were great! Very believable. The Green barbarians don't look like Frazetta's; they look much better. I did not expect the humor, but it was fun and in the right amounts in the right places. The Martians wear more clothes than in the books, but hey, it's Disney; it doesn't hurt the story. We also loved the Art Nouveau flavor of the Martian architecture, tatoos, armor, etc. The palace in Helium was stunningly beautiful.<br /><br />  No, Carter here does not come off as charismatic as, say, Brad Pitt's Achilles, but he's a lonely, depressed Civil War vet who's lost his family in a particularly tragic way, and a man of action, not of philosophical words and exquisite sensibilities.  It works for me just fine.  I also enjoyed Ms. Collins as a capable, intelligent woman, who doesn't overdo it as if she had a feminist revenge chip on her shoulder: her Martian princess is confident in who she is and is \\"at home in her skin,\\" as some say. Beautiful, over-acting women with lots of attiude but no athletic skill to go with it can be really annoying and ruin an action movie, but Collins shows how it should be done. Other supporting actors (including some familiar, competent Brit faces) are also reliably \\"on key.\\"<br /><br />  We don't have a 3D tech TV, or I'd get the 3D.  This was the first movie I tried to watch in 3D and actually enjoyed it that way, but without 3D the colors are more vibrant, so both are good. I sure hope the word gets out so it is eventually successful enough to make a sequel. And somebody better make a decent video game, too!
B0037QGS0K|4.0|When she suspects her husband David (Neeson) of infidelity, Catherine Stewart (Moore) hires a hooker called Chloe (Seyfried), whose task is to test David's faithfulness and report back to Catherine. Of course, as in real life, things don't always turn out as planned.<br /><br />Like Egoyan's masterpiece \\"Exotica,\\" but to a lesser extent than that film, \\"Chloe\\" underscores how perception and reality are often not the same. There are sufficient surprises and tension, especially sexual tension, throughout the movie to keep the viewer's eyes nailed to the screen. There is also symbolism aplenty. For example, the recurring appearance of glass doors, mirrors, windows, and other glass objects represents the inherent fragility of free will: Glass is a brittle, transparent material through which one can readily see, but in \\"Chloe\\" it serves as an ironic contrast to the characters' shortsightedness, their inability to foresee the consequences of their actions.<br /><br />While the plotline may be standard fare, for Egoyan it is no obstacle. His gift lies in his uncanny ability to elicit strong emotions from the viewer, without resorting to sentimentality, and to appeal to the intellect as well. These attributes are the stuff of art, and they are masterfully achieved in \\"Chloe\\" through a combination of first-rate acting, a taut script, wonderful cinematography, and a superb film score.<br /><br />The 1.85:1 Blu-ray picture is top-notch. Colors are rich yet natural. Clarity and detail are exceptional in both interior and exterior locations. Nighttime shots reveal ample picture depth, solid blacks, and good shadow detail. I found myself longing for more lingering shots of the wintry Toronto cityscape, conveyed here in a serene, quiet manner redolent of the sublime snowy scenes in Egoyan's \\"The Sweet Hereafter.\\" Dialogue and ambient sound are clean and crisp, and the soundtrack, consisting largely of Mychael Danna's dreamy, soulful music, comes through with great clarity.<br /><br />In sum, \\"Chloe\\" is an engaging and poignant symbol-rich thriller that warrants more than one viewing; it is also a fine antidote to the plethora of vapid films being churned out these days.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy; fun game. My kids wants to learn how to play this game cause they watch me play. They like the spited that is on the cards. I really enjoy playing this game!!
B007B6VOG0|3.0|I was really excited after hearing the single, We are young. I quickly bought the album but came to find that only the first 4 songs are actually good. the rest are cheap mainstream sounding pop songs like 'it gets better'

B0075PYG1M|3.0|Enjoyed a few tunes.  Curious as why a great bassist like Derrick Hodge is lost in the mix.  Great cover of \\"Teen Spirit\\".  I kind of expected more.  Not really fond of Lalah's cover of Sade's \\"Cherish The Day\\". Should have left that classic alone.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book definitely held my interest, but I thought there could be a bit better character development. Without spoiling the end, I was very drawn in by the dilemma the parents face in defending their son, the conflicted emotions, and of course the intentional blindness to the possibility of their son's guilt. However, I found the ending ridiculousky unsatisfying.
B002ZDOXM6|5.0|Good quality CD of this fine boy band; I listen to it in the van on trips and feel good.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I heard Gold on the Ceiling and just had to get this CD.  I'm not disappointed - good tunes throughout!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I must admit that I bought it by accident for my kindle but I never regretted I bought it. For those who like quests,  it is a nice toy to kill some time with.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|could'nt put it down. read all 3 in 2 weeks! another good one you should read is THE SOLAR WIND SEARCH WITH AUTHOR LAURA E. COLLINS.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Call me crazy, but this CD has become my guilty pleasure.  It's quite a bit out of my norm, but I actually love it.  Though this album has that 'ode to days gone by' thing going on, her vocal talent is truly outstanding.  Fun album, really catchy songs, seemingly light on the surface with layers that run deeper.  I honestly like every single song here, but my fave would have to be the title track.  I'm very pleasantly surprised.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Awesome fun for all ages! Easy to earn points to unlock other game.  Also your rewarded for returning for more fun! Cant find another like it:)
B006YDG0KG|5.0|I'm so happy this book The Magic came out, for reading the secret was very interesting which I shared with many others but The Magic actually tells you HOW to make this work and I'm finding out each day that IT IS MAGIC!I got my daughter who lives far away from us very excited by telling her about it and now she is doing this as well. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you so much for this, I'm very grateful...this book has changed my life!Looking forward to the next new book that comes out.
B00006FDCD|1.0|The tone is totally off. Major parts of the book have been changed. The \\"happy\\" music in different parts of the movie just do not fit. Clearly some studio jerk wanted the movie to be more \\"happy\\" then the story really was.  Worst adaptation of a book I have seen. Most of the acting is horrible.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Great weather app! Simple  intuitive and full featured. The interface is well designed and responsive. Highly recommended.  Samsung Epic 4G Touch.
B007CKB2AS|4.0|I've had this album for a couple of weeks now. I've put it through my usual \\"evaluation\\" process, listening to it through several times in my car and at work. At first I was a little put off that it didn't sound like a traditional Springsteen album (using loops, sampling, and a tiny bit of rap), but all but two of the songs have grown on me. I don't understand reviewers who listen to an album a couple of times and write quick reviews. Music to me takes time to analyze and judge.<br /><br />Much of the criticism I have read about \\"Wrecking Ball\\" centers on the fact that Bruce cannot possibly understand the plight of the working man because he is a wealthy rock star. I think that is rubbish. Bruce has always excelled at telling stories, and they are not all autobiographical. Another criticism is that this album doesn't sound like some of his iconic '70's and '80's albums. I'm glad it doesn't. We'll always have those earlier albums. I want something new and topical. \\"Wrecking Ball\\" fits that bill. All of the songs, with the exception of \\"You've Got It\\" touch on the hard times many of us currently find ourselves in. The album does progress to hope through faith and endurance. The lyrics of \\"We Take Care of Own\\", \\"Death to My Hometown\\", and \\"Shackled and Drawn\\" all make reference to the failures and crimes of our politicians and the financial industry. Every time Bruce speaks these truths, he risks his record sales and concert revenue with the many who disagree with him. That takes courage. Taking risks with your music tasks courage as well, as it leads to the criticism that you aren't the artist you used to be. The upbeat music of \\"Easy Money\\" belies its dark subject matter. The guitar solo and keyboards on \\"This Depression\\" lift the singer's grief to his lover (and maybe to his God). I love the gospel feel of \\"Rocky Ground\\" and can even tolerate the bit of rapping in the middle section. And the symbolism of the title track works for me. Is Bruce talking about a football stadium or our brief existence on earth, or both? Listen carefully.<br /><br />My minor criticisms of \\"Wrecking Ball\\" are with the plodding and overly long \\"Jack of All Trades\\" (the producer should have faded this song more aggressively, as he did on \\"We Take Care . . \\" and \\"You've Got It\\") and the parade of cliches lifted from better songs on \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\". I miss the contributions of Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici, but this isn't an E Street album anyway.<br /><br />I recommend this album. It is better than the previous two, and probably is Springsteen's best since \\"The Rising\\". I think it will be a touchtone to 2012 much as \\"Born in the USA\\" was to 1984 or \\"Born To Run\\" was to 1975. Bruce is not the same person he was on either of those two albums. Let him grow and enjoy the musical experience.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I tried out Docs to Go, OfficeSuite 5, KingsOffice, and QuickOffice HD.

B007E6YYLO|5.0|I'm new to this zombie genre. Let me preface my review by saying I've never liked the zombie genre until now -- The Walking Dead changed that for me, and this episode \\"18 Miles Out\\" is my favorite.<br /><br />The most critical character interaction for me was Shane and Rick.  The Shane and Rick dynamic has been a freight train heading for a catastrophic collision.  I actually found seeing these two friends finally have this confrontation, a conflict  that's been bubbling underneath the surface for some time, far more disturbing and more frightening than the possibility of zombies attacking them. Man vs. man... Taking a page from literature, I kept thinking of Shane as Shakespeare's Iago in terms of Iago's ability to deceive and misdirect Othello and others. (This is my observation after season 2 ended.) Watching this episode in light of how Rick and Shane's original relationship was depicted in season 1 before the apocalypse is ultimately heartbreaking.<br /><br />I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I wanted to respond because some people have responded so negatively about this episode and others this season.  I have this saved on my digital recorder, and it is the one episode of \\"The Walking Dead\\" I keep reviewing  obtaining new nuggets of information.  In the end, we all have our idiosyncrasies about what makes a show/episode work for us as individuals.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|From your phone or computer you'll always have access to your notes. I use this to take notes in meetings, make my to do lists or save funny online articles. Love it! No longer I worry about remembering or waste time looking where I wrote down that number.
0956251579|3.0|A gripping, suspenseful page-turner which gives insight to obsessive-compulsive disorder and borderline personality disorder.  Editing could be improved; it makes me cringe when I read sentences such as \\"In the end it was him that gave up first\\" or \\"I don't know who moved first, whether it was him or me.\\"  Other, similar sentences can be found throughout the book.  Aside from the editing issues, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and read it rapidly, with my heart palpitating at times, not knowing what was coming next.  Brilliant plot.

B004A8ZWWO|5.0|Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) is the building manager for an exclusive apartment complex in New York. He is not just a building manager but he is the best building manager who has an almost 6th sense of what is patrons need to be happy. The cheapest condominium in the tower costs $5.25 million so he has a staff trained to spoil the people that live there. The top floor suite is rented by a billionaire, Mr. Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) who is a stock market investor. One day the building is raided by the FBI and Mr. Shaw tries to escape but is captured. They want him for stock market fraud and billions are missing.<br /><br />It seems that Josh Kovacs 6th sense didn't work so well when he asked Mr. Shaw to manage the retirement funds of the tower's employees. All of the hard working people of the tower are now faced with starting over and some are near retirement age with their future dreams now lost by the greed of Mr. Shaw. Some of the disgruntled employees plan a heist to rob Mr. Shaw and recoup their lost money before he can get away with swindle....<br /><br />This movie has a wonderful all-star cast that makes it a real good comedy. There are some really good one liner jokes in the script that just cracked me up! My favorite was the maid's retort, \\"You should have tried the cake, man!\\"<br /><br />As you can imagine, everything they plan for the heist goes wrong but they adapt along the way to make this movie fast moving and entertaining. Unfortunately not the entire great cast delivers to their best capabilities but overall it was still a good movie.<br /><br />I recommend it to you to see to have some good laughs!

1568814518|5.0|This is a great addition to any origami library. It is preferred I suspect, to have some experience and moderate understanding of origami and tesselations. The directions are clear and well articulated. The pitures provided give a better understanding of the various processes you follow while folding your models. The projects go from front to back in a progressive mannor; beggining, intermediate, and finally advanced. The models are created both by the author Eric Gjerde, and several other masters of the study. I strongly reccomend this book. For the price I consider it a bargain, it is a treasure.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter is charming and affable in a bungling school-boy way, plus he's a serial killer, but only of those who are truly deserving...  He faces his toughest opponent yet in season 4, racing toward the jaw-dropping conclusion. I won't give it away. You simply must view this for yourself. Best series on TV, but not for the squeamish, or feint-hearted (or grandmothers, either....)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|pretty fun games. some are addictive!! there are plenty of them to choose from. it is free so I suggest you try it.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|We are re-watching the entire LOST phenom on video after its run on TV. Finding that I'm enjoying it the second time around even more because I'm seeing more of the foreshadowing of characters and events, and recognizing it as such. So much happens in the series that many parts I've forgotten are still fresh. If you weren't seduced by this series when it aired, buy all six seasons and hang on for the ride...!
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Bruce has had commercial ups and downs,  some of his best albums (Nebraska) have been his least commercial offerings.  Come to think of it,  Wild Innocent & E-Street Shuffle didn't sell diddly when it came out unless you lived in Philly or between Mobile and Houston.  In recent years \\"The Rising\\" was fabulous,  \\"Magic\\" was sensational, and \\"Working on a Dream\\" was (being polite here) less a less than stellar rushed offering.<br /><br />Now to the new Album,  Wrecking Ball.  If you get your news from the Fox Channel,  you'll probably be wondering what Bruce is complaining about,  after all isn't everything Obama's fault and aren't the banks and the rich 1% all job creators.  Aren't the poor and unemployed all just lazy slobs buying Cadillac Escalade's with Food Stamps?  Bruce challenges the status quo with a hybrid mix of Rock, Traditional Folk, and even a little Hip Hop thrown in.  Many have heard several of the songs live over the last few years and know that there are some strong ones (Particularly Land of Hope and Dreams which features Clarence Clemmons).<br /><br />The music is strong, but not immediately pop but grows on your quickly.  Some songs are sort of dull and clunky but those make up only a few tracks on an otherwise very strong album.  Not many artists can put out consistently good music for 40 years and Bruce Springsteen has managed to do that once again with his new album \\"Wrecking Ball\\".  It gets 4-Stars from me because it's a good solid album,  above average, but not on the same level (what could be) of Bruce's greatest works.
B0041G67YW|5.0|this movie was a hellava ride. More movies should be made that have so many twists and turns. The ending was a bit far fetched but non the less great!

1603420398|5.0|I've just started crocheting so I consider myself a novice. However, I have not had any problems with the designs contained in this book. I typically work very tight which imo is a boon for motif thread work. However, I have run into problems with another motif book because of this and constantly have problems with motifs being too tight or loose. It is a constant modification exercise and I still haven't gotten anywhere with the project I wanted to do from the 'other' book due to having to tweak the number of stitches or just plain start over from scratch.<br /><br />I have not had any of those issues with this book, probably because they use a sliding circle starter which helps adjust for individual gauges.

B004LROMWU|4.0|Produced by Stephen Spielberg and teleplay contributions by a number of writers, including Robert Rodat (best known for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) and Mark Verheiden (who wrote 9 episodes for the new BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and will be an executive producer for the upcoming DARK TOWER series). First off, this is not INDEPENDENCE DAY, people. It's a grim survival tale of humans almost wiped out by an alien invasion some six months ago. The remnants we focus upon are roughly 300 men, women and children and most of them have no military experience.<br /><br />There's an interesting opening in which the children explain an alien invasion of Earth through drawings to their teachers. Electricity and satellites are knocked out and something like over 90% of humanity is gone. About the only reason the humans are able to even mildly resist is simply that the alien force has left the planet with garrisons but you don't know what's happening over the rest of the world which leads to some intriguing presumptions and rumors. Said garrisons have giant bots helping them and  the sinister means to mind control the human children through \\"harnesses\\" (alien membranes that attack from the neck all the way down to your lower back). Even when the children are freed from the harnesses there are surprises like the aliens finding ways to control those children at opportune times.<br /><br />Noah Wyle, a military professor turned sub commander, is the main character in this tale who tries to give hope to the survivors even though his wife is dead and his middle child has been taken and harnessed by the invaders. Wyle is good enough in his role but<br />acting is all over the board. Some are very good (like Colin Cunningham as the gang leader turned cook/problem solver), some are subdued but done well enough (like Will Patton as the grizzled Desert Storm veteran who all see as their leader or Dale Dye as Colonel Porter who is best remembered as Colonel Sink in BAND OF BROTHERS) and others are in the\\"C-ish\\" grade range (like some of the teenagers and medical people). I think the second season will have more episodes and give us a better feel for the acting range of this cast.<br /><br />Special effects feel like they're on budget at times but you have to remember that this is TNT. I'd say they're good enough and the reveals as to the special powers/technology of the aliens are fairly well done. The biological hierarchy of aliens was a good idea especially as revealed at the finale. As I said above the tone is grim but not hopeless.<br /><br />The first season was met with positive reviews and the two-hour premiere was watched by 5.9 million viewers, making it cable television's biggest series launch of the year, with more than 2.6 million adults 18-49 and 3.2 million adults 25-54. The first season finale received 5.6 million viewers, the highest rated episode since the series premiere; with 2.5 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic. (Wiki source).<br /><br />This show was approved for a second season and hopefully it will be more than ten episodes.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; SPECIAL EFFECTS: B; SETTING/FOCUSES: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: 2011.

B005ER6SNM|4.0|Go with me on this....Imagine queueing up to go on a rollercoaster and you are not scared because you have been on so many beforehand. Yet, on this new coaster you realise it knocks all the other coasters from your memory because this coaster gave you such a jolt, you are genuinely scared....You get where I'm going with this...<br /><br />Other reviews will give you spoilers and warnings and advise you not to see this film. This is a great way of gathering more interest because if you are like me - when someone suggests 'don't see this', I'm sorry I have to see for myself if all the hype is down to clever marketing.<br /><br />I run my own film club with some great mates, they know I like all kinds of films. I cried during 'Avatar' and I go all goo goo watching the polar bear pups on that fantastic BBC documentary 'Frozen Planet'. If I chose 'A Serbian Film' to show them, when it's my turn to host, I might loose their friendship. However, my mate Dave wanted to see it and I managed to sit through it again and support him through the full uncut version. Dave said afterwards `You can't show that to anyone, that is the most disturbing film I have seen in my life'. I reassured him that I won't , but I will keep it in my secret collection, like a collector of a valuable object that in the wrong hands, seeing it might cause disease, famine and deep psychological problems. It's a kind of control I guess.<br /><br />The acting is passionate and believable, the dark tone of the film is spot on, very oppressive and the music is strong percussive. The story is clever, perhaps predicable but it is simple which works. It's about family poverty and the hope something will come along, and so a financial opportunity arises unexpectedly for the main character (father to an 11year old boy and a husband to lovely understanding wife). We want this opportunity to make everything right again. Scenes take their time, they are not rushed and in turn this draws you into the story more. Kubrick did this in all his films. A sense of pace is so crucial. (Writing this review makes me realise film editors do not get the credit they deserve). There are family moments that are very thoughtful, gentle and sensitive. There is a scene when the father in the film answers those difficult questions children ask. This scene is wrtten and executed in such a correct and sensitive way, it's a moment that stands out for me. It's probably the only gentle moment in the whole film.<br /><br />When the film continues to follow down the spiral the main character is going, we have extreme cinema at it's highest revs.The disturbing brutal sexual and graphic violent scenes will take you out of your comfort horror zone to a very very bad place. Nothing I have seen before comes close to this nasty experience. No joke. I still have episodes when horrible images from this film enter my head. After the first viewing, like some kind of ritual, I took a long bath to cleanse my body and soul due to what I saw on screen. Many horror films are not scary they just wash over you and you forget them within seconds. This one will tattoo your soul.<br /><br />'A Serbian Film' delivers an experience that is so upsetting and degrading you will try and blame someone else that you watched it. It will make you feel guilty and ashamed....The truth is you want to open the door to room 237 because like Danny Torrence in 'The Shining', no matter the warnings not to enter 237, curiosity will kick in.<br /><br />I did like the film because not only did the hype live up to the reputation, I'm proud to have survived it. I love the film director character (see shot above ) that offers the father the opportunity that will set him up fo life. This is a disturbing and truly terryfying experience, 'A Serbian Film' does exactly what is says on the tin and oh man, I thought I've seen it all before.....how wrong was I. I wonder when the screenwriters and director had their first production meeting about their intention, did any of the financial backers get up and leave the meeting. If you decide to watch this film let me know your thoughts, but please don't blame me. After watching this film watching any other disturbing horror film will be an easy ride, apart from maybe the fantastic 'Martyrs'.<br /><br />Other reviews will go into detail of the horrific events in this film if you need to know. You can take the blue pill and forget this review or the red pill and watch the film.<br /><br />bleedingcritic<br />bleedingfilms.comtention, did any of the financial backers get up and leave the meeting.

B000UJ48WC|5.0|This is more about my experience than an actual review. OK here we go....I read the Stephen King novel twice before I finally got to see this movie at a late night showing in Southend, Essex(UK)in the 80's. Stephen King had a problem with Stanley Kubricks interpretation, other websites go into this in more detail but to be fair if you want the actual version of the book, Stephen King remade it in 1997 as a TV mini series, and that version is pretty good. It has a couple of moments in Stephen King's film version of 'The Shining' which I wish was in Mr Kubrick's version. 'The Shining' has influenced me throughout my life. I remember in the 80's when I used to say it was my favourite film of all time, people would look down their noses in disapproval or laugh. Nowadays when I say `The Shining' is one of my all time favourites people agree...My instinct was correct all those years ago.<br /><br />For me there is nothing more scary than having Jack Nicholson chasing you down long corridors with an axe in a hotel isolated in the middle of bloody nowhere. Period. (OK, I lied, if you have played games `Dead Space' and 'Dead Space 2' on Xbox 360  that's not scary, it's bloody terrifying!). I took my film club buddies to a special screening of `The Shining' at the REX Cinema in Berkhamsted, a beautiful red and gold art deco cinema, unmatched by any other venue here in the UK. This cinema will blow you away: [...]<br /><br />The atmosphere of The Rex was perfect to see `The Shining'. The icing on the cake, which was unexpected, was that Kubrick's daughter introduced the film. `Wow, it doesn't get better than this' I said at the time. It was a dream come true to see this film for the second time on the big screen. My good friend Wayne had never seen it before, he said afterwards...'I dunno what to say, I can't say I liked it because it was an experience. It blew me away. I'm speechless'. Wayne's totally right, the film is an experience and one that I've cherished.<br /><br />I remember when I was at drama school we had to be a famous person for a day and I chose to be Jack Nicholson. When I arrived at the school in character, in my old black city mini, I had the third year students check the school over for bombs and security because I asked them to be my body guards. My explanation for driving a small car was due to the fact my limo had broken down. I (Jack) was visiting the school to talk about `The Shining 2'. I never forget Damon Albarn (who was in my class at drama school) decided to be the Ayatollah Khomeini and said he wished he thought of having body guards like I had. I also learned Jacks lines from `The Shining' and continued to use them throughout that drama school day. Great memories!<br /><br />The film had an ongoing impact with me, 'Jack Torrence' would be the part I was born to play, but damn, Stanley made it when I was too young to play a recovering alcoholic father. Years ago when we went to Canada and crossed over to Maine, I enquired about the location of the `Overlook Hotel'. At the time I didn't know the inside scenes were film sets. And I was way off target to travel to the actual Timberline lodge which is an hours drive from Portland. The lodge is featured in the film as the outside of the `Overlook Hotel'. So eventually a video shop owner in Maine (with a shelved wall dedicated to only Stephen King videos) told me where the man himself, Stephen King, lived... I was going to press the button on the open security gate to Stephen's home, but my bottle went, I chickened out. The home was huge, red with iron fencing with three serpent headed iron bats resting on the gate entrances.<br /><br />My friend Guy has an actual framed print from the film which is very cool, I have a Blu - ray copy I bought overseas which is the full version. A long time ago I had the idea for a film `Shining 2'. The story; a group goes on a trip to see where `The Shining' locations and influences are ....and one of the group actually has somekind of breakdown similar to the Jack Torrence character. I remember seeing a similar idea in the sequel to 'The Blair Witch Project'. I missed the boat on that one, I had a good idea and someone else not only thought of it as well, they had the means to implement it.<br /><br />Nicholson is spectacular in the role of Jack Torrence, Shelley Duvall is an absolute wreck as the story develops. The making of `The Shining' by Kubrick's daughter is enlightening, especially about Kubrick's demands on Shelley. The film is way ahead of its time, especially with the Steadicam work that enables the camera operator to run smooth following the actors, most notably the child on the cycle Go Kart rolling over wood and carpet, in turn creating the distinct changing floor thud sounds. Awesome stuff. I also remember seeing the soundtrack available on record once in London, I didn't buy it and boy do I regret it now because it's unavailable. So many film makers have been influenced by this film and deservedly so. Kubrick's obsession with attention to detail is crazy or genius; everyone has their own take on this. I think it's a bit of both. However, it is the end result that matters.<br /><br />I wonder what people in their twenties and thirties feel about the film. Maybe it's not on their radar or they have their own personal film that's made a mark. Who knows. It's inevitable one day `The Shining' will be remade. You could research so much about this film online, it really is that interesting. I remember reading that Simon Cowell almost worked on it but decided not to. I hope this film holds it's value in the future, it's so unique.<br /><br />I'll leave you with this thought; Can you imagine an amusement thrill ride park that has a huge special set built exactly like the Overlook Hotel and real snow covering an external large hedge maze and when you visit this experience....a Jack Nicholson lookalike (one that can act of course) comes after you. Some people would pay alot of money for that thrill. And so would I.<br /><br />Terrific.<br /><br />bleedingcritic<br />bleedingfilms.comrrence character.

B004XIQIPQ|5.0|First off, Arctic Monkeys are an amazing band! All their albums rocked, great lyrics and sounds. This album is really different from their other albums but still great! It has a 50's sound to it; some very beautiful songs on the album. 2 of my favorite songs of the album are \\"She thunderstorms\\" and \\"Suck it and see\\"! I recommend this album, just give it a listen, go on Youtube listen to some of the songs see if you like it! You won't regret getting this album, well made Arctic Monkeys!

B005ML9YOU|5.0|There are several delightful moments for those who read these adventures; however, the ones I would like to point out are not any of the delightful moments when Sherlock Holmes gives his explanation of the facts but rather the great humorous lines Sir Arthur Conan Doyle uses from time to time, like: \\"What did you do, Hopkins, after you had made certain that you had made certain of nothing?\\" - The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez. In addition to the great read these adventures provide, I would like to point out a couple of things: One is the fact that the customer gets a super low price on the complete collection of nine volumes, and the other is the fantastic ability that the Kindle and its apps give us to check the meaning of a word using the dictionary provided. I had no idea that a \\"hansom\\" was a horse drawn carriage, among many other words I didn't know. Incredible read, a classic for all time, buy it, read it, enjoy it.<br /><br />Jake Taylor

B0073L91MW|3.0|Big fan of Sean Bean, not such a fan of this movie.<br /><br />The editing or direction is a bit choppy, and the character development is almost non-existant.<br /><br />Still, it was worth the price of the rental for any WWII movie buffs.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|For those people who believe it was a great book because it was realistic I ask, what is wrong with you? The whole book is a series of crappy things happening and at the end the author tries to \\"put a frown upside\\" by making it so that two of the main characters get together and have kids. I hate books that are tragic throughout the whole thing and at the end try to put a smile on it by letting two people get together. Everyone else has died, if she is going to make it tragic, the least the author could do was kill off everyone or every except the main character. It was a horrible book what is the point of reading a book or watching a movie if you can't escape reality for a bit?? Instead of feeling glad you read the book after you're done you just end up feeling drained because they killed off some of the best and most innocent characters. It's sad when we have people in our world who come up with these kind of books or movies. If you ask me, this is why crappy things happen in reality because we have so many people in the world who thrive on books like this.

Rebecca Hamilton did a Great job of writing in a way that I had a good mental picture of the scenes, which I have found not many author's can do so vividly.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Former Confederate cavalry officer John Carter finds himself whisked from Earth and transported into the middle of planet-wide war and intrigue on Barsoom...or, as we know it, Mars. Only wanting to return home, he finds himself caught between his sense of what is right and running from his own haunted past while discovering friendship, loyalty and ultimately his own place in the universe.<br />Western. Science fiction. Adventure. Romance. Comedy. Remember when going to the theater was an 'event'? The whole family piled in the car, got to the theater, put butter on the popcorn and when the lights went down you got butterflies in your stomach because you were so excited? The last time I had this much fun and sense of wonder I was a kid watching Raiders of the Lost Ark on it's first run in theaters. John Carter pretty much has something for the whole family to enjoy and I found myself smiling from ear to ear and wanting to return to Barsoom/Mars as soon as it was over.<br />Many reviewers panned the film mercilessly, mostly pointing to it's bloated budget. Quite truthfully many reviewers aren't economists or accountants, so who cares what the budget is? Finding a film, a great film, with this much sense of fun, adventure and an unabashed joy at being escapism (for the whole family, natch) is pretty dang difficult in our age of cynicism and 'reality' television entertainment.<br />If you read the reviews the thought, \\"Meh, I'll wait,\\" DON'T. John Carter is exciting to watch, beautiful to look at and truly felt like one of the long-lost 'event' movies of my youth.<br />You'll be pleasantly surprised to find yourself wanting to travel back to Barsoom.

B004LWZW8S|5.0|That involves Greek mysthology and war.  King Hyperion (bad guy Mickey Rourke) wants the Epirus Bow in order to release the Titans and destroy the human race, but Theseus is not going to let that happen.  He quickly builds his confidence and takes over as leader to stop the king, even recruiting some fighters.  There is lots of blood, fighting and Mickey Rourke as the bad guy was awesome.  I hated his character, but I was supposed too.<br /><br />The movie has a great story line that shows Theseus, King  Hyperion, the Titans, the Gods, the Oracle and more!  I cringed at parts that were gory but overall the movie had great characters and plot line.  Even if an action movie isn't your usual cup of tea, I recommend checking it out.  I find mythology so interesting and love seeing how different directors perceive it.
0385535139|4.0|I hestitated downloading this book after reading all the reviews...but Grisham is Grisham and I figured I'd give The Litigators a chance. Glad that I did. The writing was excellent, the characters were brilliant and the story was great. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because some of the dialogue during the trial was, in this reader's opinion, tedious. If you want to read a great story get this book!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Other reviewers have written about this very passionately so I will keep this short.<br />Star Wars belongs to all of us - not only George Lucas.  Without the fans of the original trilogy, he would never have had the income to build the effects houses that granted him the possibilities to toy with them.  So by dismissing the original films,  he is dismissing the people who brought him his fortune - his fans.  I went to see the original films many many times in the theater and later my VHS tapes worn thin - that's not something he can ever take away from me.  He does, however, have the power to restore those original films to a modern technical standard.  The fact that he can't do this for us (and there are a LOT of us), is beyond me.<br /><br />The worst thing about these 'updates' are that many of his changes are just bad and gratuitous.  A lot of the effects work feels choppy, and stand out in contrast to the original effect work.  And most egregiously - it interferes with the narrative.<br /><br />Spielberg admitted he regretted revising ET with CGI, because he felt like he was toying with people's childhood memories.  He promptly made the original version available on all formats.  Steven.. Sit down with your dear friend George and talk some sense into him, will ya?  The original Star Wars, as clunky as outmoded as it might be to him - evokes a lost, childlike feeling in millions of people.
0743270754|5.0|I went into this expecting an especially well-written history book discussing the Civil War era, with an explicit focus on the interactions between Lincoln and his cabinet - and it is that - but it is so much more. At some point, you begin to realize that the story is really an allegory for anyone who wants to run a business, lead an organization, or a manage a group of diverse, disagreeable personalities toward a greater goal. The parallels between Lincoln managing the executive branch - then only a fraction of its current size - and managing a large, unwieldy organization, will strike you over and over again, and you will realize how much there is to be learned from this man even a century and a half after slavery's fall.<br /><br />All of the characters will seem familiar, and you will see yourself in a few of them: the rhetorically gifted and wealthy Seward, who was insultingly viewed as \\"Lincoln's Brain,\\"; the ex-slaveholder Bates, who would rather spend time with his family than work in Washington; and the suspicious, intelligent Chase, who filled his empty social life with a thriving ambition to usurp Lincoln's office. All of them are people you will know from your office or workplace, and you will watch with amazement as Lincoln quells their disagreements and educates himself from their diverging points of view. And, slowly, gradually, he builds a consensus among them that drives his every policy to the war's conclusion.<br /><br />The slavery issue, as featured in the book, is fascinating as well. It was not obvious back then how immoral slavery was, and though hindsight gives us an immediate sympathy for the abolitionists, you quickly realize that they are viewed as naive utopians, even in Republican party circles. The multiplicity of viewpoints on slavery will surprise you, and it will also make you wonder how many issues that appear \\"complicated\\" in the present time, really are not. None of the candidates for the Republican nomination propose abolition:a few propose limiting its expansion to the Western states. You come to see that Lincoln was elected because he was viewed to be much more moderate on the slavery issue than he actually was, and his switch to a much more hardline anti-slavery position angered many of his supporters (including a large slice of the Union army) - once again, the way that Lincoln builds the consensus that allows him to end slavery in the rebellious states, and secure its abolition in the loyal border states [in only four years!] will astonish you, all the more so when you see how very pro-slavery America was in 1861.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough. Beyond what I've mentioned above, there are so many little touches that will delight the history buff - the way in which Kearns Goodwin details the mechanics of party bosses [like Thurlow Weed and Simon Cameron] is fascinating, her refutation of theories of a homosexual relationship between Lincoln and Joshua Speed is convincing, and her careful ability to reconstruct cabinet-meeting arguments, point for point, as the members argued them, is the book's greatest asset. I cannot wait to read it a second time.<br /><br />P.S. - President Obama has definitely read this book. The parallels between Lincoln's appointment of Seward, and Obama's appointment of Clinton, are too uncanny to be coincidental.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I am an occasional runner. Bought this watch at Costco 18 months ago.<br /><br />Bezel user interface is sluggish and unresponsive when wet (e.g. because of rain or sweat). Silver buttons are sensitive, so that hand and arm movement activate and change the display.<br /><br />Despite limited usage of watch battery died and will not charge anymore. The 90-day warranty is far too short to provide any meaningful repair coverage. Base repair cost is $110. But this is where a lot of company make their money: keep warranty periods short and then charge whopping repair fees.<br /><br />Summary: I just did not expect the watch to die after just 18 months. Need to buy a new one, but with a bit of luck it will not be Garmin.
B0076NAWWA|4.0|This is a wonderful cd. My take is, that Portnoy plays with Neal Morse/Transatlantic to get his prog on, plays with Adrenaline Mob to get his metal on, and help put together Flying Colors to get his pop/rock on. Now consider that they had a short time to put this project together so why not tap the best rock musicians around to make it happen. There is an old story that Chris Squire's wife, after hearing Return To Forever's \\"Romantic Warrior\\" album told Lenny White (RTF's drummer), \\"how long did it take you to get that great drum and bass sound\\", where Lenny White responded we recorded the whole session in a week. She replied \\"it takes takes Yes 6 months to get a drum sound. I hope you get the point. I classify this as a pop album with great players and it really works well. Portnoy ranks the Endochine II cd as one of his favorites of all time hence the inclusion of Casey McPhearson. Endochine is kinda like if Radiohead were from Austin, and Alpha Rev is kinda like if Coldplay were from Austin. I know that is a generic simplification and unfortunately the Endochine recordings do not do the band justice. I had the pleasure of seeing Endochine play at Minute Maid Park in Houston before the 2004 Super Bowl and they were absolutely incredible, not hampered by the production value limited by their recordings. I always heard them for what they could be not as the recordings reveal. But I digress, Mike reveals the great talent that Casey is, not to mention the great players that compliment this recording. I love Steve Morse and he plays wonderfully on this recording, but I would have loved to see what Eric Johnson could do with this material. Maybe one day, enjoy!

0307957934|1.0|This is being written on April 1, 2012 - April Fool's Day - and a most appropriate day to write about this book, because I can't believe that Robert Harris who wrote such  marvelous books as \\"Pompeii\\" and \\"Enigma\\" could or would write a book this foolish, this empty of meaning, of plot, of character, or interest.<br /><br /> You see this young (early forties) genius - name of Alex Hoffman - has left CERN in Geneva and started a hedge fund based entirely on an a computer algorithm (VIXAL-4) he has written. The algorithm processes all relevant trading information on the internet in a millisecond and then executes the appropriate trades in the next millisecond. All it needs is the dollars from investors in the hedge fund to feed it - and there are plenty of both - plenty of dollars and plenty of investors. More than that the algorithm is self taught too, capable of continuous self-learning. So it's no wonder that Dr. Hoffman's hedge fund is enormously successful or that he has a lovely wife and a life of monastic luxury in Geneva.  (He's not a fun guy.)<br /><br /> But wait! In a span of 24 hours it all goes to hell. He (the real Dr. Alex Hoffman) learns he has set up a bank account in the Cayman Islands, has sent himself a strange book on the faces of fear in humans, among other things, given the entrance code to his house to a murderer with instructions to kill him, hacked into his own medical records, ruined his wife's art show by buying up all her works and - what is much worse - set up a clone of VIXAL 4 and the computers necessary to run it in a warehouse in Geneva astride the principal incoming cable lines. But has he really? And if not him, then who or what? Well, if you haven't already guessed it you're an innocent in sci-fi thriller-land - as I was - and am. - and you really don't know that there is such a thing as anthropomorphism where human qualities can be incorporated within machines. And that's what has happened. (Not only that but VIXAL-4 has run amuckin terms of billions of dollars and has cost the Dow 1,000 points.)<br /><br /> So there are now really three Dr. Hoffmans - the real flesh and blood one, the one incorporated into the first VIXAL-4 by anthropomorphism and then the third Dr. Henderson as cloned into the second VIXAL-4 by the original VIXAL-4. And what you don't know - and what the book never tells you - is whether it is the second Dr. Hoffman or the third Dr. Hoffman that is doing all these terrible things to the real Dr. Hoffman And to what purpose? Well to measure, to observe, to study his Fear Index!<br /><br /> But don't worry. This is April Fools Day and you well may hear a lot of nonsense today; and if you want to read nonsense there's no better day than today! But tomorrow sanity returns and you can put this book down and see it for what it was. April Foolish nonsense and a waste of time!
B003EYVXT6|4.0|Certainly not your run-of-the-mill horror film, \\"Splice\\" tends to fall into the thinking man's sci-fi/horror hybrid ala \\"Moon\\" as another recent example.  It's not really all that scary especially when you've already seen the trailers and know what's going on.  It can also be compared as a modern day \\"Frankenstein\\" where scientists mess with Mother Nature.<br /><br />In general I liked the movie.  However the film creates this interesting creature but focuses too much on the external elements of that act rather than on how she/he might evolve.  Still, you have to like it for some technically excellent filmmaking and a different sort of thriller.<br /><br />The Blu ray is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and transferred in 1080p.  The film has a full range of color but the muted browns and indoor shots look particularly good if a bit soft.  The audio includes DTS-HD MA 5.1.  It is clear and concise even with the quiet scenes.  The LFE channel doesn't have much activity.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A Discovery of Witches is an absorbing supernatural romance, full of surprising plot twists and engaging characters.  It is an \\"Ensemble\\" novel, where the entire \\"cast\\" of characters play their part so well, you forget you are reading a novel.  There is a sequel coming out in July which I already have pre-ordered and look forward to receiving.  Enjoy!
B003KGBISY|4.0|Japanese master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa directs this 1954 epic saga which is the premise for a more modern \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" released in 1960.  Kurosawa's film takes place in 16th century Japan but the plot is the same.  Samurai are hired to help protect a small farming village from bandits who regularly pillage the town for food, supplies and women.<br /><br />The movie has a place in film history primarily due to the great technical work of the Kurosawa and his crew.  Wonderful cinematography, editing and settings.  For me the film doesn't reach \\"all time great\\" status due to lame acting coming from some of the secondary characters and the numerous crowd shots.  Heresy I know, but crowds usually don't cry in unison, walk and hunch over in unison, laugh and stop laughing at exactly the same time.  I would have like a bit more sword fighting as well.  I don't know what the Japanese culture was in 1585 but I'm guessing neither did Kurosawa...ouch!<br /><br />At 3 ½ hours, the movie is long and tedious at times.  An hour could have been cut by eliminating all of the long, silent, soap opera like stares into the distance.  I did like Takashi Shimura's performance as the master samurai Kambei.<br /><br />I will say that the Criterion Blu ray looks great.  Shot and displayed in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, the transfer is 1080p.  The black and white film is crisp and has never looked better.  The audio include a lossless PCM mono and LPCM 2.0.  Both are in Japanese and both are excellent.  Subtitles are provided.
B00138J1XK|5.0|An iconic classic album with a pure clean sound.  Everyone knows \\"Dust in the Wind\\" and \\"Carry On\\", but it is the rest of the album and songs that need to be heard.

B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Jeffrey Archer at his best, again. Emma has really turned out to be a very formidable character. I can't wait for The Clifton Chronicle's 3
B003L77GG0|3.0|Though it lagged in some episodes, Smallville in its whole is representative of nearly 80 years of testament to the human spirit. Equality, government, immigration, sharing of knowledge and technology - you name it, it has graced Superman-based anything through the character's life. Smallville was to be the story that was never told - what happened to change Clark Kent to the Man of Steel.<br /><br />Despite episodic lag, Smallville grew into a heavy head of steam during seasons eight and nine. And we knew what it was leading up to: allowing us to believe a man can fly.<br /><br />The only negative in the climatic Season Ten is when Clark dons the suit. We never get a good look, the character is far away in the distant frame, et al. The DC purist in me wants to give it Five Stars for accomplishing exactly what it set out to do, and the fact that by the by they did it well. Maybe the intent was for us to see Superman's initial appearances as the John Q. on the streets of Metropolis - faintly, a blur of colour, from a distance safe enough for a mortal to be generally assured survival without the rendering of aid. If that indeed was the intent (and no special features I've seen testify to that point), then bravo!<br /><br />But the fanboy in me wanted to see something epic. Something worthy of a ten year old promise. The producers knew exactly where they were going to end up: Clark in the Suit. There was never any doubt. Quite simply, I was expecting something Super.<br /><br />So please, do not take a mid-grade biased heavily by the series finale at face value. The series as a whole definitively averages four stars per episode, and Season Ten is inclusive to that.<br /><br />The special features of this final season are on par with everything we've seen included so far: random commentary, occasional featurettes, and the like. But you didn't buy this DVD set for the extras. You bought it to see a man fly.<br /><br />And at that, we almost do.
B001JNNDBA|5.0|Amazing!!! Time travel, 80's music, Jake Gyllenhall...and Maggie too. What's not to love? Highly recommended. The entire movie flows so well. All the way down to the magnificent ending.
B005HSL626|5.0|I always loved the free version on ipod touch but when i downloaded this on my kindle i was really happy to see the free version on here was the full version with ads. The ads dont bug me at all.
0307749347|5.0|I bought the audio version because it's easier to listen and ponder a book like this as you drive (especially if you are by yourself)!  What habits get in the way of you being more productive, focused, and enjoying your life.  We want to be happy and there are great ways to change our habits so we experience more happiness. At work or in life the principles he discusses are all relevant to assist us and help us grow.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|as other reviews have stated, the trilogy itself is fabulous, and certainly a better value than purchasing for kindle individually. There is however a small discrepancy in the font through the series. It wasn't really enough to be distracting, but I did need to adjust the font size on my device.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|besides the somewhat annoying adds for other games this was really entertaining! if you're looking for some easy entertainment this is the game for you. It was the perfect fun for my wandering mind with mini games and the incentive to unlock the other games included. I definetly recommend it, what's there to loose anyway? its free after all.
B0033TJATW|5.0|Great DVD one of Jackson's BEST. Even my 19 year old grandson loves it. All of Jackson's music is loved by my whole family so three generations are still enjoying Michael!
0762777931|5.0|Wow, An incredable book, and way of life. Kris Carr has done amazing research and is absolutely right. This is GREAT information on so many topics, it's hard to put down. You NEED this book!
0393338398|1.0|I've read several books in the psychology/economics/statistics mould, and thought I'd enjoy this after seeing some of the five star reviews - many of which claim that you don't have to be a massive baseball fan to enjoy the book. However, after grinding my way through ninety pages, I finally gave up.<br /><br />I genuinely found this one of the most tedious books I have ever (tried to) read. The writing style contains no flair or wit whatsoever, and I cannot see how anyone but the most obsessive baseball freak could enjoy reading about an assortment of obscure players, scouts and journalists - none of whom really seem to do anything of interest. Beane himself seems a mildly interesting character, but the dull as ditchwater writing style kills the book stone dead.<br /><br />Don't understand any of the hype over this book. One star - but only because I can't give it none at all.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the one year Bible reading option and daily study guides that fit your lifestyle. Highlights and you can take notes, great free app!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is important as it offically ushered a new era of hip-hop. In 96', the legend that is 2Pac was murdered, and in March of 97', Biggie was shot down too. For the next 3 years, hip-hop and its music had became dull, and besides a few new commers such as DMX and Busta Rhymes, the genre of this great music was slowly decending downwards as rap was trying to find itself.<br /><br />During this time, a white rapper from Detroit was hiding away, along with Dr. Dre, producing and creating what would be a classic album. That album was however The Slim Shady LP, released in 1999. Although its hailed now as a classic, this album was known, but kind of still a secret back in the hip-hop world in 99'. Em and Dre went at it again, and Aftermath records released The Marshall Mathers LP in May 2000. Not only did this introduce alot of people from the new generation into rap (this, along with Dre's 2001 album were the first two i ever purchased) but it also got hip-hop sough of back on track. The flow, shocking and outragous lyrics, along with intense production and some great beats to go along with Em equaled this album. Personally, its in my top 15. Before this, during the time period of 97' to 99', i could name only 4 really great rap albums, Blackout (Method Man & Redman), 2001 (Dr Dre...it was released in 1999 btw), Slim Shady LP (Em) and Its Dark and Hell Is Hot (DMX)...i know i could think of more, but these 4 come to mind. Only four albums, wow that shows how average and tarnished rap was once it lost Pac and Big. Eminem provided some light for fans like myself.<br /><br />Here are the top 6 tracks from the album:<br /><br />1. Stan (argubly one of the greatest songs of all time, whether if your talking about hip-hop or not, this song is genius, inventive and masterful. This song has everything, from intelligant lyrics to a nice hook to nod your head too....Eminem shows pure greatness in this song)<br /><br />2. Marshall Mathers (an Em classic. The beat is so horrocore, as are the lyrics and the flow. Some of Dr. Dre's best production work is right here in this song. Eminem raps about the haters, and how they have gone from douting him, to loving him. Em however gives them the middle fingervand basically says i don't need you on the bandwagon. Epic tune, and a top 10 track by him)<br /><br />3. Bitch Please II (this reminds me of both 'Whats the Difference' and 'Forgot About Dre', the tracks from Dre's 2001 album. It features a fast-pased bassy beat, and has guest vocals and verses provided by Snoop, Dre, Xzibit and Nate Dogg. Definatly a classic song, which brings the Aftermath fam together)<br /><br />4. Criminal (a song with a nice skit type intro in which Em addresses his more annoying fans and critics, and then the beat drops, and its seriously amoung my top 10 beat samples of all time. The lyrics follow the theme of the songs title, being a criminal)<br /><br />5. Kill You (a similar song to Criminal, in which its fast paced and both follow the same style of meaning. Really good song, and with it being the first full lengh song on the album, it sets the pace for the album)<br /><br />6. The Real Slim Shady (a classic Eminem track. A great single. It follows the same comedic values as his song 'Without Me')<br /><br />A truly great album..,

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a all time favorite.<br />This is more intense than Dresden Files, and you really cannot put<br />it down. I've read all three, and I saw the movie first, and the book<br />was so good, even after the movie. The book has more detail than<br />the movie, that added to the experience.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|This review is written by my 6 year old daughter.....<br />I loved the game so much, I wish there was lots more episodes. When it went near the end it began to get a bit tricky, but at the beginning it was easy peasy.

B0074JOCIG|5.0|Everyone involved with the production of Live at the Beacon should be proud. This DVD captures great performances with excellent picture, sound, directing and editing. Even the packaging, photography and design are special. This is yet another showcase of Joe Bonamassa's ever increasing skills as a guitar player, a vocalist and a collaborator.  Joe is becoming more sophisticated in his playing as time goes on and his vocals are superb - noticeably stronger than the early days of his career. It is clear that this band has great chemistry: Tal Bergman on drums, Carmine Rojas on bass and Rick Melick on keyboards. (I especially enjoyed Tal's bigger than life personality which was apparent even from behind the drum kit.) The set list is well balanced with some blistering blues rock (The River, Blue and Evil, Young Man Blues) as well as more quiet, nuanced and soulful songs (Midnight Blues, Bird on a Wire, Mountain Time, for example).<br /><br />All of the guests are exceptional and each felt like a true collaboration - with time for the guest artist to shine as well as time for Joe to shine with his fantastic solos. It was obvious Joe brought in artists he very much respected and his desire to collaborate only makes him a better and more well-rounded artist. Paul Rodgers still has a great voice and it's nice to hear Joe play a couple of Free classics with him. John Hiatt is a wonderful song writer and I remember Joe stating earlier last year that Down Around My Place was his favorite song from Hiatt's release \\"Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns.\\" It is a haunting and dark song and Joe's solo made it even better. Beth Hart's outstanding vocals and stage presence added a lot of energy and exuberance. Her beautiful vocals on I'll Take Care of You and her dirty strutting growl on Sinner's Prayer complimented Joe's playing so well. It is delightful to see such pure joy and appreciation of the other musicians on the stage just beaming from her. Very much looking forward to their future work together as their collaboration album \\"Don't Explain\\" is world-class.<br /><br />Bonamassa is not just highly skilled but the emotion that he conveys with his playing is incredible. He pays tribute to his influences as well as honing his craft and his own personal style. He put together an amazing set list, an amazing band, brought in some stellar guests and put on a memorable show that I'm very glad to have on DVD to enjoy anytime. Highly recommended!

B003Y5H5HY|3.0|I purchased the BlueRay version.<br /><br />First comment:  on my high end sound system - the audio wasn't simply bad, it was so garbled that we had to turn on English subtitles.<br /><br />Second comment:  The director did not get the point of the books.  Missed it entirely.<br /><br />On watching the special features, one sees why.  The director declared that \\"all people are perverts\\".  This leaves the director in with perverts, who are always convinced that everyone is just as perverted as they are, just afraid to act out.<br /><br />And, strangely, that was a comment the villain in the book makes (and in the Swedish version), but has been edited out of this version of the movie.<br /><br />In fact, most of the solution of the mystery, and clues leading to it, are glossed over so quickly in a rapid-fire single-conversation-piece as to leave the viewer out of the loop in the way the mystery was solved.  What isn't given short treatment are the rape and torture scenes, and revenge sequence.<br /><br />Lisbeth is also transformed from the almost autistic (to an outsider) behavior that is a critical component of Lisbeth's character into a traumatized punker.  And a end-of-the-fireball conversation between Lisbeth and Bloomquist was a most serious omission.<br /><br />In fact - it is very clear that, unlike the Swedish director - this director did not understand the books or the character.<br /><br />GWDT is about abusers, abuse, and how authorities, bystanders, and family all react to abuse.  There are significant insights in the book.  This movie doesn't even approach them.<br /><br />And the start of the movie shows why.  For the director, this was just an action movie that had sufficient material in the original to justify scenes of sadism.  The Bond like introduction and overall treatment miss any deep thought or serious consideration.  It is simply a search for excuses to be graphic.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is watchable.  Rooney Mara did a fine job.  But her Lisbeth is not the one of the book.  Craig's Bloomquist is one dimensional.  For fans who want the character and themes of the book, watch the Swedish version.  It is well done, and it is better to read the subtitles than to attempt to make out the audio on this botched Blueray Disk.

0802136834|5.0|I was introduced to Henry VIII and his wives via Masterpiece Theater in the 60s...and again with the Tudors more recently. I've read dozens of historical novels about the Tudors, but this book is the first one that truly gave me a sense of the HISTORY of Henry's reign. The politics of the period: the driving force of the need for not one but several male heirs; the lives of women versus men; the rudimentary medical; the constant travel; and the financial challenges were fascinating. Beneath the magnificent trapping of royalty wound continual power plays, plots, and intrigues, both within England and with England's varying alliances with the Holy Roman Empire, France, and Spain. A wonderful read!
B0074JOCIG|5.0|This guy just gets better and better.  The classic Bonamassa sound shines through on this outstanding performance.  The BluRay in DTS Master HD Audio looks great and the sound is simply awesome.  I love the Royal Albert Hall concert, but the sound on this one is better.  I will not even try to rate Joe's performance....other than to say it is SMOKIN' HOT!<br /><br />The guest spots are all really good.  John Hiatt was especially good.<br /><br />There is not a need for a wordy review here.  Concert is superb.  Extras are very nice.  Another awesome performance from Bonamassa and his spot on band.  Just go ahead and order it.  If you have the capability for the DTS Master HD Audio....get the BluRay!

B003K16P3M|3.0|omfg this book gives me a mix of feelings i hate the type of speaking they use but LOVE the romance and action.<br /><br />okay first of all i could barely understand the words coming out of their mouths. and the names of pretty much everything lack creativity. i mean c'mon bitterblue WTF is wrong with you?<br /><br />It's sweet that katsa falls in love with po i mean really it's wonderful but she is supposef to be the STRONG FEMALE LEAD and she gives in to him as soon as she talks to him for the first time.<br /><br />So bypassing the part where i hate on the book i think its super sweet how po loved her when she was stil refusing him and hitting him in the jaw but other than that.....<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br /><br />i don't like how she just dismissed giddon like he was nothing i think kristin should have made him fight for her a little more although we all knew her and po  would fall in love and have the overall love factor in the book. king leck was a drag they didn't speak much of him.i think they should have had a couple of chapters just on him.<br /><br />i don't think you should read this if you can't comprehend things well this is an okay book but judst not for me.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|gotta say this one hit the spot. the game is a great time killer. the game is fast paced easy to learn.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|The hunger games.<br />okay so the story takes place in south america which got destroyed in a great big catastrophy and is now called panem. every year the two tributes(a boy and a girl) from every district 1-12 go to fight each other to the death.<br /><br />DUDE!!!!!!!<br /><br />This story lacks information first of all. so panem is in soith america and there are really poor districts and really rich districs and i guess middle class districts okay whagever but then you don't say nythi g about the other continents are they the same as they are now are they different from panem or the same? i am pretty ssure she said south america got destroyed NOT THE ENTIRE WORLD.<br /><br />okay this has nothing to do with tha hunger games but.....<br /><br />OMFG okay i was making some breakfast so i tried to have it read the book to me .....WORST MISTAKE EVER!!!!!!<br />it is computerized iknow that but seriously they need to do somethin else cause one it is choppy two  pronounces words completely wrong and three does not sound appealing to me at all. anyway....<br /><br />i know it is all about katniss but you could have put a little more information bout the tributes out there. also would've made it alot more interesting if you forged some friendships in there but that's just my opinion.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Wow, this is the first time I have seen a DVD series that so carefully follows the books.  I loved the books, and I love the DVD.  It is perfectly cast, and beautifully shot.
B000FQVY2C|5.0|I have no valid excuse for not having heard this album until a few months ago. I'm in my 50s and have been an avid music addict for decades. I've seen John Cale in concert twice (once, unfortunately, when he was not sober enough to avoid falling off his chair onstage) and have heard a few of his more raw and noisy albums (I still love the \\"Sabotage\\" live album). But I was late to the party on \\"Paris 1919\\", and had never heard it in its entirety until I bought the new version of the CD with the bonus tracks. Well, now I see what all the fuss was about; tremendous album! Beautiful, melodic songs; more like orchestral folk music than rock. I shouldn't complain about all the extra music on this disc, but I think the number of bonus cuts were overkill. A few of the \\"string mixes\\" and \\"piano mixes\\" are interesting, but I don't think we needed 3 versions of the title track. Some of the other \\"alternate\\" versions become tedious after a few listens. But hey, that's nit-picking; this really is an impressive recording.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|In the first two books, it was hard to put my kindle down.  I really enjoyed the plot, the dialogue and the flow of the story in general.  The love triangle has been overplayed in the past few years but it worked, not over played but definitely there.  What I really liked about the first two books is that I didn't want to put them down.  I wasn't always on the edge of my seat but I was always left wondering, \\"what happens next?\\"  The third book, that was tough to push through.  I really wanted to get closure, to find out how it ended and what becomes of the main characters but it was, for lack of better words, kind of boring to read.  There was so much description, inner thoughts, speculations... I don't know what it was really, almost painful to get through.  In the end, it was a great story with a satisfying ending.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|amazing graphics and quest topics I'm addicted to this game more than anything else. everyone should play this game its really fun and an amazing
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't finish reading the book and has no will on finishing it. Two words--IT SUCKS. I can't believe this is a New York Times bestseller. Warning: Don't buy this book. If you want to read this, borrow it from a friend who mistakenly bought it.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|The Big Bang Theory Seasons 1-4 came in amazing condition, and was shipped very fast to my house. This is my favorite television series and I can relate to all of the men in the series(nerdy). With all the episodes combined, there is almost 48 hours of pure Big Bang Theory. It has only been two days and I've already seen 10 hours of it and I can't get enough!
B007N6NGYG|5.0|I purchased this game so I can play it on my Bionic and Xoom. Works fine on the Bionic but not on the Xoom, an error says \\"Unfortunately, Train Crisis HD has stopped.  I tried rebooting the Xoom and I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and getting the same results.  EDIT:  After a few days of writing the review I decided to try it on the Xoom again and now it works flawlessly.  Not sure what happened to make it work, but now it works.  Really a fun and challenging game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Some of the games are kind of stupid but they are pretty addictive. Easy instructions. simple enough for ages 4-90.
B007C9N4H8|4.0|This was refreshingly well done - so good to see the muppets again. But...Sarah Silverman should have had a bigger part.
B006T5LGXA|4.0|Taken from the NMMNG Tour, this is a really good set list. Are there tracks I wish he would have done? Of course. Do we really need another live version of \\"Poison\\" or \\"18\\"? Not really. But for what it is, this is a fun and worthwhile album. I saw him less than a month after it was recorded and the show was stellar.<br /><br />The downsides, other than some glaring omissions of other classic songs, are two: First, the sound quality isn't nearly as good as prior live efforts, such as the last live DVD, \\"Theatre of Death\\". To me, it sounds like a soundboard recording. The audience is back in the mix, and at certain points some guitars sound more like background playing, rather than being higher in the mix, as a proper Alice show has them. But! Don't let that be a turn-off. It's not bad sounding, it's just not loud enough.<br /><br />Second, the dreadful version of \\"Fire\\" - this is not Alice's cover of the Hendrix classic that he recorded in the 90s. Alice brought Arthur Brown onstage to do his tribute to pyromaniacs. Brown's voice sounds terrible, at best. Thankfully it's the last track on the second CD and easy to skip.<br /><br />Again, though, this is a killer live album. \\"Brutal Planet\\" is heavy and, well, BRUTAL. The extended \\"Halo of Flies\\" is done perfectly, and the other tracks sound really good. The band, lead by one of Alice's old cohorts, Steve Hunter, is on top of its collective game. And Alice's voice is rough, as we like it, but much more in tune and listenable than \\"Theatre of Death\\", where he seemed to shout everything and lost track of the melody on many tunes. My advice is to buy this immediately.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|most of the games are good. to many adds though.watt to many. also some of the games are slow and glitchy.
B000002USN|5.0|I have enjoyed this CD lots--the only problem is that I was not mailed this CD...I got Duets II again.  I originally ordered Duets II and Duets, but did not received what I ordered.  I copied the CD that I am reviewing from a friend.  The CD is wonderful, but I did not receive what I ordered; I just did not mail it back as it is too much of a hassle.....in response to a review of Amazon, you let me down this time.
B0071T3Q9K|4.0|Great old timey tunes. Very catchy and relaxing. Paul's still great and creative at 70 years old! His itunes performance of some of these songs were great to watch as well.
B006ZZC3D6|3.0|I loved the game on the iphone. So I got it on android. I was surprised to see openfeint installed with it in a recent update. And more surprised to see that its removed now. I saw an openfeint directory and deleted it manually.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Fun, challenging game. Some puzzles take awhile to figure out, so can be frustrating. Cute graphics. Works well on my Fire.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|Untill they fix the text formatting of this book I would not recommend it.<br />Font is really large, and it feels like reading a book designeg to reach a much younger audience.
0393072231|5.0|Very well written.  Of course it's just one perspective on a very complex event, it's not meant to be comprehensive, but the story it tells is definitely worth reading.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I have 13 apps that I have downloaded that won't install on my tablet. What do you recommend might be the problem.  Whether they are free or purchased, compatibility is checked however, still won't install.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I love this movie. My 10 and 5 year old liked it I think Disney just counted on more nostalgia and knowledge of this brand that wasn't there. Maybe if Mars had been in the name. I dont know. But a good sci fi super hero movie. Especially considering the source material may look copied but is the origin many Others copied from... Good movie
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple wows me with her origional music. If you love her other Cd's you'll love this one as well. I got this used- and paid a little over $4 for it. What a deal!!!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|This book was a wonderful read.  I couldn't stop reading even at work!  It kept me wanting to read more.  I love Sophie kinsella's books, they are always a delight to read.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|I own a few professional stabilizers, and have tried many different ones, but always had a hard time balancing them.  Because of that, I was very skeptical in ordering this one, but figured I would give it one last try.  As soon as it arrived I put it to the test, and it took me about 15 minutes to balance it with my Sony VG20, and I was up and flying.  I absolutely love it!  There is a nob to adjust it forward and back, and another nob to go side to side.  It is just so easy to use, and even comes with a bubble level built into the product for leveling.  Buy it, cause you can't go wrong for the price you pay.  Thank you Opteka for an awesome product!
0545265355|5.0|I read these a few years ago through e-books but enjoyed them so much I wanted to have the set in hard back. Books were received in perfect condition and I even got my husband to read them!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This was a great movie.  It shows how life really is and how decisions can make you a great person, and how bad decisions are so sad and how they affect the people around you.  It was a bit of a tear jerker in spots, probably depending on what your age is.  It certainly is a film that would be good for young people to see.
B003UESJH4|5.0|- Logue: \\"Please don't do that. I believe sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.\\"<br />- Bertie: \\"My physicians say it relaxes me.\\"<br />- Logue: \\"They're idiots.\\"<br />- Bertie: \\"They've all been knighted.\\"<br />- Logue: \\"Makes it official then.\\"<br /><br />At a time when the British empire teetered on the brink of war, a monarch perceived as flawed would have been detrimental as fudge. The years leading up to this had the declining King George V (Michael Gambon) condemning one son, Edward, Duke of Windsor, for plunging the crown into a royal family scandal. The king had also been long frustrated with his second son, Albert (or \\"Bertie\\" to his inner circle), the Duke of York, who suffers from a lifelong debilitating speech impediment. Public speeches are nightmarish endeavors for Albert, and Colin Firth is so good here that he immediately draws you into Bertie's mortifying deaths in the limelight. Perhaps no one cursed the advent of live radio more vigorously than this stuttering royal. But it must be true that someone always profits from another's misery. Colin Firth deservedly won an Oscar for playing the tortured Duke of York.<br /><br />Albert's boon lies in his wife Elizabeth (a superb Helena Bonham Carter) who stands by him indefatigably, with kindness and understanding. Her unrelenting efforts to help him with his malady at last produces the eccentric Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush, again remarkable). As Albert would later remark of Logue: \\"No training, no diploma, no... qualifications... Just... a great deal of nerve.\\" That sums the Aussie up.<br /><br />In 1936 Edward ascended the throne after the passing of his father, King George V. However, he abdicated later that year in light of his controversial romancing of the American commoner Wallis Simpson whom he wanted to marry (and who is adept with \\"certain skills acquired in Shanghai\\"). Sucks for Bertie who now reluctantly assumes the tarnished crown, the sovereignty having very much fallen out of favor with the masses. And then 1939 swings around.<br /><br />This movie engrossed me. It's close to a perfect movie, in my opinion. THE KING'S SPEECH is a triumph of superb acting; it is a precise character study. But that sounds too clinical. There is also warmth and surprising humor and an understated love story. THE KING'S SPEECH sheds a light on a historical footnote - concerning Bertie's stammer - long overshadowed by Edward's scandalous gallivanting. THE KING'S SPEECH focuses most on the sometimes strained relationship between Bertie and Logue as they work to counter Bertie's stutter. Logue's methodology is unorthodox. No predictable marbles in the mouth for Logue, or tired elocution drills. Instead, he espouses breathing exercises and physical exertions and verbal trickeration (such as rolling one word into the next). He also requires intimacy from his patients. Logue is a contrary cuss and insists on being on familiar terms with Albert, calling him \\"Bertie.\\" You can imagine Albert's royal indignation. One of the film's many monumental moments surfaces when Albert plays the record of his recital of a Shakespearean piece. What he hears astounds him and convinces him to stick it out with Logue. This is how an unlikely lifelong friendship is forged.<br /><br />In 1939, Britain entered into war with Germany. Although more a figurehead than a real power, Albert - now formally called King George VI - still has a responsibility to the people. To rally a beleaguered kingdom, to represent steadfast resistance in the face of a great and oncoming evil, Bertie must speak to his subjects, and speak with resolve and with clarity and certainly without stammer. The film climaxes with King George VI's famous radio broadcast on September 3, 1939 as he prepares Britain for them dark days ahead, as war looms ominously. It's a sequence confined for the most part to a claustrophobic room which holds the king and his nemesis (a microphone) and a calmly orchestrating Logue. It's been a while since I've sat thru a sequence more mesmerizing and more fraught with nervous tension. It was electric. THE KING'S SPEECH, stirring and passionate and very much a humanizing portrait of a flawed but brave and decent king, is required viewing. If nothing else, you get to see a Helena Bonham Carter that doles out patience and compassion. How rare a role is that for her?<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary with director Tom Hooper<br />- \\"An Inspirational Story of an Unlikely Friendship\\" - the Making Of featurette (00:23:39 minutes)<br />- Onstage Q & A Panel with the Director & Cast including Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter(00:22:01 minutes)<br />- Two Speeches from the real King George VI: the pre-war speech (radio broadcast September 3, 1939) and the post-war speech (Newsreel May 14, 1945)<br />- The Real Lionel Logue Highlights - author Mark Logue talks about his grandfather, Lionel Logue (00:10:34 minutes)<br />- PSA: The Stuttering Foundationstrating Logue.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|For reasons I'm now unsure of, I kept putting off reading this book despite being an avid SF fan. What a mistake! Wool is one of the best novels I've read in the last several years: absorbing, deftly-plotted, and utterly free of pretension.

B005K2Z2O2|5.0|This case was exactly what I was looking for.  It is a rugged case that will stand up to plenty of wear and tear.  It will also stand up to my kids knocking off my kindle from my nightstand (they keep their bedtime books there too).  I don't have to worry about it ever getting scratched like a leather or fake leather case would.  I can just toss it in my laptop bag, which I purchased one of those too when I saw how durable my Kindle case was.  I couldn't be more happy with my purchase.  It is a bit expensive, but it comes with a LIFETIME warranty.  How many other Kindle cases can say that?  I purchase the Green/Grey [[ASIN:B005K2Z5IA Timbuk2 Kindle + Kindle Touch Ballistic Envelope Sleeve with 360 degree protection, Green/Grey]] one and the colors on the picture are exactly as in the picture.

0385534639|5.0|This book cast a magical spell over me at the very beginning, and I was hooked!  Every time I picked up the book to read more, I felt like I was being pulled in to this circus.  I thought the author's style of writing was mesmerizing, and the story was so different from anything I have ever read.  There were some parts where I felt it was being dragged on and on and I wondered if the end would ever come.  Once the ending did come, I was sad to be finished!  Highly recommend!
0062082353|1.0|This book is really a waste of time. Kyle does not give you any degree of detail about becoming a sniper or what he did. Mainly he just tells you he is a \\"real badass\\" and he loves to kill people. Truthfully, you may think in another life this guy would be a serial murderer the way he crows about it. He is definitely a psychopath.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app - its free too, so you don't have any excuse not to get it. it also means I can take my Bible everywhere I go, without having to carry the giant book - and I don't have to worry about losing it, as long as I have my kindle with me. easy to use, as well, and has many good features. I highly regimens.
1594744769|4.0|This book was fascinating, exciting, and spine tingling! Ransom Riggs posseses a knack for evocative sentences. I had a mental picture the whole time. However, this book isn't sure what it wants to be. It has young kids as main characters. Is it a kids book? No, there is too much crude language. Is it for teens then? Well, maybe, but the plot seems suited to children. It seems that the author could have had a much wider audience if he had left out the unecassary language. (Mind you, it's not any worse then a typical PG-13 movie.) I liked the book, but I wish Riggs had followed the rule of know thy audience.
B0076D20E8|2.0|I thought this movie looked interesting, but i honestly felt like the movie was lacking.  After about an hour I was thinking, is this over almost...but it still had an hour left.  It got better towards the end but it wasn't what I had hoped for.
0307888908|4.0|Another great book on the power of networking. It is co-authored by the creator of Linkedin, which has surprisingly to many, been around for a lot longer that new comers like Facebook. The book is primarily aimed at those people on the career treadmill looking to make a change, however the information provided is certainly applicable to anyone.<br /><br />This book addresses 'networking' as something you give before you receive. It demonstrates how cultivating a wide and diverse network is what will not only support you through all phases of your career but also provide you that elusive opportunity that you never though would be attainable. The books shows you how to go about building and utilizing a network in an intelligent manner rather than merely collecting 'friends'. Most importantly, it demonstrates that you need to not only nurture and build this network but you also need to contribute back to it if you plan to benefit.<br /><br />Too many people and businesses scoff at the concept of 'effective' networking. They view it the old world thinking of 'schmoozing'. Nothing could be further from the truth in today's terms. Tools such as Linkedin and Facebook make the whole networking process so much easier but to be effective you still need to create a system to gain the most advantage. That is what this book will show you.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and very enjoyable. It provides practical examples of effective networking as well as action point for you to take away and implement. There is little doubt that if you take this book to heart and implement even some of the suggestions it contains your chances or networking success are far greater. Take a leaf from the book of these authors who really know their subject and start implementing one of the most powerful success opportunities you have available today - business networking.
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|Typical HBO, take a good story and throw in as much sex and naked bodies as you can without getting thrown to a regular porn channel.  My co-worker kept telling me what a good show it was and I read the reviews on amazon which were much more frank in nature with the Tudor series.<br /><br />I can live with the gory battle scenes but I found the naked bodies and various sexual positions/genders distracting for what is otherwise a visually stunning and well written series.<br /><br />I will not be buying this series because there is no point if I can't share a show with my children.  Pity, good shows are hard to come by.  Network television is over run by reality shows featuring people I have no desire to know anything about.

0439023513|3.0|The first book was excellent. The second book got a little weird, but was still rather good. This book just felt awkward and unfitting with the rest of the story, the vast majority of the time. The ending seemed like the author got sick of writing about the aftermath of the war, or maybe sick of writing period, as the pacing didn't really fit. Rather anticlimactic and unsatisfying.
B000FC1336|5.0|I was a little hesitant to buy this novel based on the mixed reviews. After reading the Sample I decided there was nothing wrong with the writing, in fact, it was good. I really enjoyed the story - I found the main character to be interesting and likable, as were the secondary characters. I enjoyed the technical details, similar to Tom Clancy.

0312641893|5.0|Reason for Reading:  Upon reading the summary, I knew this book was for me as it had everything I'd love in a YA novel: fairytale retelling, sci-fi, cyborg, and dystopia.  I had planned not to start any new series this year but I didn't know this was the start of a series until I started to read the book.<br /><br />This was fabulous!  I have to admit that when it really boils down to it I do much prefer science fiction to fantasy, and yet I don't read nearly as much of it.  This hit the spot perfectly.  A fairytale retelling that goes far beyond the scope of the original fairytale.  Meyer has managed to hold onto the basic characters and some major events while throwing the familiar plot out the window to bring us a new version of Cinderella that had me glued to my seat and turning pages almost faster than I could read.  Cinder is the dominant character in this book and one fantastic female lead who carries the plot all on her own.  I took to her character right away and found her to be very well-written, with genuine feelings and emotion.  She is a person who stays true to her own nature no matter how it will affect appearances sake.  I also found the dystopian world intriguing.  Set in some unknown future, a century after World War IV, the world has changed its political divisions and ruling systems, is different in many ways and yet not so much that it is still a believable possible reality.  The book ends looking forwards to the sequel and yet has a satisfying ending for the book in hand.  Something I appreciate in series books.  One of my favourite reads this year.

0307352145|5.0|I'm a pretty quiet person. I like to read, learn, think, reflect, and absorb. I dearly love people, but I prefer them in ones or twos, so I can offer my full attention. This is a good thing!<br /><br />Susan Cain will tell you why in her amazing book about the psychology, personality, and power of the introvert.<br /><br />I loved this book! Cain is the first person I've ever come across who agrees with me that one can be quiet without being shy. There is a difference! I've always said so, but nobody listens to me.<br /><br />And now I know why! Did I mention I love this book?<br /><br />The book is divided into four sections. The first, \\"The Extrovert Ideal,\\" shows how our society has changed over the past 70 or so years, becoming obsessed with extroversion, and reveals some problems this has caused. Cain explains the strengths and weaknesses of both introverts and extroverts, that both have something valuable to offer, and why balance is necessary.<br /><br />The second section explores the biology and psychology behind quiet tendencies, asking the question, \\"Can introverts become extroverts through training and determination, or are they what they are?\\" (This section gets pretty technical, but is fascinating if you'll choose to hang in there.)<br /><br />The third section explores the Asian culture which tends to focus on the introvert. Cain focuses here on the experiences of Asian-American teenagers often caught between both cultures.<br /><br />The final section is full of practical advice for both introverts and extroverts on how to get along with one another--particularly within a marriage and at work. Cain helps introverts determine when they need to stand their ground and when it helps to fake it, becoming a pseudo-extrovert. She also tells how to do this without over-stressing yourself or becoming insincere. She closes this section with a chapter for parents and teachers of introverts on helping them successfully transition into a world that often won't accept them for who they are.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Cain gives examples of well-known and respected introverts who used the strength of this bent in order to make great contributions to society.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all introverts.<br /><br />I also recommend this book to all spouses, parents, and teachers of introverts.

B002PMV9FG|4.0|Anyone else notice that as Harry Potter gets older the darker(evil, depressing) the movies became. I saw that movie a couple of month's ago, but coldn't remember it, so I have decided to buy the entier series over again, Sill missing the first 2, and Deathly Hollow 2. He was so cute at 11 and the I fell in love with the movies.<br />[[ASIN:B002PMV9FG Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Widescreen Edition)]]
B0063IH60K|5.0|its the basic old fashion solitaire. but it was very very very very very very very very very very very fun
0439023513|2.0|I must say when I am reading the first two books, I like the twists and turns especially in the second one, but The Mockingjay has pretty much no surprises that make me hope there is no more. I kept thinking to skip through to the end and I was right. There were too many words in the middle that can barely leading up to something you would hope for. It is sad, but not only for how the story end but how the first two books' buildup leading to an incohesive ending in the third one. There are still too many unanswer questions about Panem and the characters, especially when half of the series is about the war! From Which, people will need more about the country's future If it is the ending to the Games I would say it is good enough.
B004KPLVW2|4.0|Please accurately describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I have the 5-disc Tron set, so I am reviewing the \\"Tron Original\\" Blu-Ray that came with the set.<br /><br />Aspect ratio is about 2.20:1 (seemed a little less wide than 2.35:1).  The movie lasts about an hour and 34 minutes.  Sound is DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio.<br /><br />The soundtrack is probably the best surround sound I've ever heard.  There is a lot of sound from the surround speakers, and sub-woofers.  It was perfect, and I give it a 10.0 on a 10.0 scale.<br /><br />The video quality varied.  Outside of the computer it was very good to great (not perfect).  Inside the computer it varied.  It seemed like there was a lot of grain in scenes that had humans.  Most scenes without humans looked near perfect.  Colors were fantastic, but blues, and human faces had the most grain.  Blacks were perfect (no grain, and no distortions).  I rate the video from 8.0 to 10.0.  I've never rated a Blu-Ray's video less than 4.0.<br /><br />So far, I am quite please with the purchase of this 5-disc set.

B004EPYZUI|1.0|This review isn't about the movie itself. It simply is THE best action movie ever! Hot women with fire arms....Hollywood please take note. I am disappointed though and it is because that the product description said there was a digital copy. There isn't and amazon needs to fix this. I will note that the description I read was on the Amazon app for the iPhone. I did however manage to find the Blu-Ray/ DVD digital copy set at Best Buy......sigh! I no likey best buy.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I can't wait for the DVD.  This is an exciting Sci Fi movie.  I wish that someone had told more people about the books that I read as a teen. It made the movie even better. Edgar Rice Burroughs and H.G. Wells two of the greatest Sci- Fi writers of the 19th and 20th century.  They put it all in motion. This movie does justice to the books and the \\"Star Wars\\" type genre.  It will become a cult classic just like Dune.  You have to try to understand.  It reminds me of the the other race of indians long ago in the Louis LAmour westerns and put that together with the Sands of Time recent movie and you just about have an understanding. Its a great family hero type movie. It has good versus evil.

B007CGLRWA|5.0|I related to this wonderful film as a 38 year teacher.  I watched it twice on on demand, tried to VCR it the second time, but it didn't come out that well.  I can't wait until the DVD is released.  While the sub plot involving the teenage prostitute is a bit too much, the classroom scenes are haunting and frightfully real, particularly when it is the first day.  The faculty burnout scenes are beautifully scripted as a consequence of students bad treatment of teachers.  Those not in the profession who villify teachers constantly should see this film and maybe have a degree of sympathy for us.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really did enjoy all three books of this triology. It is so different and the twists and turns keep you rivited to the books! Cannot wait to see the movie version now!

0439023483|5.0|I read alot of reviews, good and bad, before buying  this book. I am so glad I decided to read it.<br /><br /> To those who thought Katniss was dull, boring, cold and/or unfeeling: I found her to be the opposite. To me she was a character who feels too deeply. Is it any wonder she closed herself off and struggled every time her emotions threatened to surface? The reality of life in District 12; growing up watching the games; the loss of her father; the pain & anger she felt when her mother gave up which essentially resulted in the loss of both parents; her only friend an angry boy similarly burdened by a harsh reality; assuming responsibility for her family and herself at age 11; and those are just the highlights.  Collins slips in moments like replacing Prim in the games, her grief over Rue's & Thresh's deaths, her confusion over Peeta and inability to lose the boy with the bread, that provide glimpses into Katniss's psyche proving her to be a character of great feeling. We may not like her coping skills but it makes her more real.<br /><br />To those who cringed at the violence: welcome to reality.  I too read for pleasure and to escape reality.  But if more of us stopped watching garbage like Jersey Shore & The Bachelor, and started taking notice of the pain and suffering in our own towns, let alone that of people in places like Africa and the Middle East, maybe we could do something about it.  If a new generation of teens reads these books, is able to open their eyes to what's going on in the world and finds it despicable, then perhaps there's hope for a better future than Panem. Escapism is great but we can become addicted and overdose on it.<br /><br />I applaud Collins' use of the first person narrative. While it prevents greater character development for everyone but the main protagonist and omits details (you can't expect Katniss to know everything about Panem or the other characters), it drew me in almost immediately and held me there while I devoured thetrilogy in two days.<br /><br />I am changed by this story and I am sure I will read The Hunger Games again and again in years to come. Thank you, Ms. Collins.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Do not listen to the critics about John Carter. In all my life of watching movies compared to reading the idiotic critics' comments, this is the worst, undeserved bashing of a movie I have ever read. They had to be on dope while sticking their heads in a toliet at the same time. If you follow the pattern of these losers' lives, if a movie does not have the F-word every 10 spoken words, or gobs of nudity, sex abuse, rapes, and x-rated violence, the movie can't possibly be any good. Well, the critics that bombed these movie need to wash their mouths out with soap. This is a great movie and I will definitely buy the DVD when it comes out to see the director's cut.<br /><br />I think, for whatever reason, the critics were out to get Stanton on a personal level. They love taking down success, especially when it as come from a path that is not vulgar.<br /><br />Buy this DVD. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />This is the greatest flopbuster you will ever see.<br /><br />Dennis
0439023513|3.0|SPOILERS!<br />After I finished reading Mockingjay I quickly went online to see what other people said about it. I find that both sides have appealing points, however I settled for the side that stands by the disappointing factors of this book. I must give heed to concerns that perhaps most people do not like the book because it wasn't a fairytale ending. That this book was truly about war. I agree that the series were much more than a love story. I sensed that, and Collins communicated that very well in the first two books. But the reason I believe Mockingjay was not very good, was not for the lack of fairytale ending (reality isn't always a fairytale ending and neither is war), in fact I'm at peace with that. I think it wasn't a very good book because characters were not properly developed, the ending was abrupt, the book was inconsistent with the other two, and loose ends were not tied up. There was no resolve. For those who say, \\"But this story was about war\\", yes it may have been about war but it was heavily inconsistent with the previous books. A story needs to flow together and if she wanted the entire story to be about war, she should have linked a few more things between mockingjay and the rest of the books. It is not good for someone to lure us into a story with two books that seem to take you a certain direction and then completely surprise you with some hidden agenda: ranting about the horrors of war. We all know war is bad, I wish she would have still incorporated that while still staying true to the characters and to the last two books.  I don't disagree with the fact that Gale took a job elsewhere, or that her sister died, but it was all so fast and abrupt and there was no development or closure to it all. Perhaps these stories could have been better if they had been drawn out to more books so that each piece of the story could have developed more. Everything was just a mess and that is disappointing. I think Collins may have found way too many loosethreads to tie up and because she committed to a trilogy ended it in such an abrupt way. I am sad because I have fallen in love with these characters and I now I will never know how they evolve or how they end up. She didn't do justice to her characters. There is so much more she could have done with the story.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun, relaxing, and challenging without being frustrating.  Easy interface. Very clever game design.<br /><br />I look forward to more from these guys.
B006C1DH92|5.0|this app works really good on kolindle fire. it is AMaZING!!!!!!!!!!! you will love this app!!!!!! you totally should get this game better than original!!!!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I'm at a loss -  3 or 4 stars?  I'll settle for 3.5.  I like the story enough that it took only too little time amidst my busy schedule to finish it (though that's not entirely an accurate measure).<br /><br />The story had me on edge all the time.  But the ending, though it was a surprise, was a disappointment as well.  I did not know what was coming, but when it came it left me wanting for more; but then it was already the end.  I wanted to have a glimpse of what went on in Laurie's mind after their Jamaican holiday (probably not possible with her husband Andy as the narrator).  I wanted to know what happened to Laurie and Andy after the car crash.<br /><br />I'm not the type of reader who would be happy to draw my own conclusion, and there were just so many details in the entirety of the story that it seems odd to be left kind of hanging in the end. That's how I felt at least - hanged (pun intended).
1741798981|5.0|I've reviewed guidebooks by Lonely Planet before so I knew what to expect with this one. I've been to London a few times so I approached this guidebook from the perspective of someone who already knows where a lot of the good places to visit in London are. I found that the guide does a good job of showing the good places to see in London.<br /><br />The guide is incredibly in depth. The last Lonely Planet guide I reviewed was of Canada, so I enjoyed reading through a guidebook of just a city. The guide covers all your basic monuments and even ones that I had never heard of.<br /><br />One complaint that I have is with the restaurant selections. I generally have this problem with guidebooks as I never think they're as good as websites like Yelp. Clearly this guidebooks cares more about showing you the sites, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Resources like Yelp should be the first line of defense for weeding through bad restaurants.<br /><br />The role of guidebooks is changing since the Internet provides many of these resources for free. While some people hate on internet recommendations, I find them quite helpful. But guidebooks are also great resources to have on hand, especially in a foreign country where internet access might not always be available. Lonely Planet will undoubtedly enhance your trip to London, but make sure you make use of concierges for help as well.

B0071BY1ZQ|5.0|This album is truly something special. As mentioned the title \\"Ode\\" can be misleading. It's not just tunes that sound like other artists, this is very much an original Mehldau trio recording. Not to mention there are \\"odes\\" to his wife, his (amazing drummer) Jeff Ballard, an ode to the idea of odes themselves, and one to his favorite childhood superhero (Aquaman - when I saw the title I figured it'd be based on someone's nickname, the liner notes show that no, he really is writing to THAT Aquaman). He's really having fun with the idea.<br /><br />All that being said, there is absolutely nothing gimmicky about this record. It is at the same time a great vibe record - you can have it on in the background while deep in thought, reflection, etc. or you can actively listen to it as a piece of music that can be thoroughly enjoyed. The playing is all top notch. Grenadier has been with Mehldau throughout all of his trio recordings, and is the ultimate pinnacle of bassists for this style of jazz. Jeff Ballard on drums is otherworldly. He is perhaps the most unique jazz drummer in the scene today, his playing is never anything short of extraordinary with amazing feel.<br /><br />If you like piano jazz at all or just great music, I highly highly recommend this. It is everything we all love about acoustic jazz trios. I cannot say enough positives about it.
B0066NA8CU|5.0|How does a woman go on when she finds out her husband is a cheating with prostitutes? Many would say she is doing it for her children or she loves him even though she will never be able to trust him again. She puts on her poker face gets a job and tries to move on, sound familiar? Hilary Clinton comes to mind and she is referenced several times in the first season. Why do public officials wives stand by their man? This show attempts to answer that, maybe the key lies in rearranging your priorities and focusing on oneself while trying hard not to disrupt your children's lives.<br /><br />Excellent series, great cast and exceptional writing, I highly recommend this series.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|ok, so can someone please tell me why in the name of the gods did this movie need to be made? i mean seriously???? the first one was TERRIBLE and this is way worse.

B005FITIGO|2.0|Tell it to me \\"as you might to a young child or a golden retriever.\\" , the business tycoon says to the risk management analyst at a key point in wirter-director J.C. Chandor's \\"Margin Call.\\"<br /><br />It's a relief to hear the CEO of MBS, John Tuld (Jeremy Irons), want the story of Wall Street's mortgage-backed securities scandal revealed in frank terms. The first half of \\"Margin Call\\" - a fictionalized, \\"inside\\" recap of those first days during the 2008 market collapse - is spent with analysts pointing at screens and cursing a corporate blue streak in increasingly strained tones. Here, at last, is clarity.<br /><br />So the analyst, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) starts his response: \\"over the  last 36-40 months the firm has begun  packaging new MBS products that combine  several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security.\\"<br /><br />That's Chandor's idea of clarity.<br /><br />His script swiftly moves to a musical chairs analogy without ever quite explaining the damn thing at the middle of it. Chandor's choice is to vacillate between minute details that are interesting but meaningless - sort of a phony authenticity - and broad analogies featuring crapbags, crapshows, and bridge-building in West Virginia.<br /><br />In short, no matter what virtues \\"Margin Call\\" might have, it's a little inane.<br /><br />Critics lauded Chandor for what he achieved on a small budget, but it's a short-term praise afforded any movie that sticks it to Wall Street. Even in the midst of the movie's crisis moments, Chandor's characters - perhaps excluding Sam Rogers, played by Kevin Spacey - seem awfully impressed with themselves. Or maybe the actors hating their own characters enough to preen through speeches in a way that makes the characters seem ugly. At any rate, \\"Margin Call\\" plays worse than a documentary on the same subject. You'll certainly learn much less.<br /><br />It opens with Sam laying off half of the MBS employees on a given floor - including risk management boss Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci). MBS is cold about how it dismisses Eric, who nevertheless manages to slip Peter, his former employee, a disk with some startling analysis on it. After Peter connects all the dots, the data will trigger a fire sale to end all of them.<br /><br />In a nutshell: Banks approved too many home mortgage loans to too many people who couldn't afford them, under the presumption that, once they jacked up the interest rates on the loans, the \\"American Dream\\" of owning a home was the kind of responsibility that no soul would dare default on. Banks were wrong. People defaulted. A lot. And since banks had \\"projected\\" much bigger gains on these mortgages - based on ludicrously high interest rates - than what actually came in, a bubble formed on their value. And the bubble burst. The investments weren't wroth squat.<br /><br />\\"Margin Call\\" boils that explaination down to Peter, Sam and Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) pointing at a printout, then reporting the news to Jared (Simon Baker) and Sarah (Demi Moore), who have been promoted to their jobs for their looks and ability to prattle on in a sophisticated, empty matter. So they all call John Tuld, who wants to sell everything before the rest of Wall Street finds out what MBS knows.<br /><br />The climax of \\"Margin Call,\\" if you will, is whether Sam, the sales floor boss, will deliver a rousing-enough speech for that sale to happen. Since it's Spacey delivering that speech - and few can speechify like Spacey - you can figure it out.<br /><br />Vagueness looms over the movie like smoke. Maybe that's Chandor's point - numbness. The script is tinged with cynicism and shifts sympathies from Peter - the math whiz who used to be a rocket scientist - to Sam. Quinto, a boring actor, also co-produced, and keeps Peter's emotions buried under his intelligence. Spacey is resurgent in a role that combines venal showmanship and a conflicted conscience. Irons opts for an annoying, caustic Brit vibe.<br /><br />Chandor has a terrific story; he'd been working in commercial/documentary film for 15 years, banged out the \\"Margin Call\\" script in four days between job interviews in Boulder, Colo. Chandor's dad worked in investment banking, so his access to the interior lives of those people should have been good. And Academy Award voters clearly agreed; his script was nominated for an Oscar.<br /><br />But Chandor doesn't play fair. When a character asks for plain talk, he's asking on behalf of the audience. When the response is muddled and technical - and the rest of the movie is, too - it's a dodge. Artful, yes. - but a still a dodge. \\"Margin Call\\" prefers to be admired better than understood. Like Wall Street.

1594744769|3.0|I am not usually a fan of what I thought would be the focus of this book...some creepy stuff. But what a surprise ! it was actually a heartfelt tale of family life and struggles and coming into one's own, even when one's own is a little creepy or at least peculiar if not creepy.  I would definitely say the book is for older middle schoolers because it does have some violent scenes but for the mature reader, it is a great read.  Definitely an imaginative and engaging tale of coming of age, discovering family secrets, and learning to trust yourself, even when the odds are against you.
1594744769|4.0|I was extremely pleased by this book. It did an extraordinary job of keeping my interest and managed not to lull or lag at any point. Though it was a quick read I quite enjoyed it, and the mystery of it keeps you hanging on until the end. The author is able to answer one question while bringing up two new ones it its place.<br /><br />The Wicker Man type character of the Welsh island setting is both creepy and whimsical. When combined with the leftover impact of the tragic and frightening atmosphere of WWII it's a true trip back in time. The inconsistency of time itself is a part of this story that kept me turning pages well past the time my rear started to go numb from sitting in one place too long.<br /><br />The idea of combining actual vintage photography (very odd photos might I add) into the story makes it all the more real as you remember again and again while reading the book that the photos you see are not made-up images created for the book, but rather the book is the made up story focused around the very real photography picked up from flea markets and thrift stores.<br /><br />It is admitted that a few of the photos were 'very lightly' edited but that the vast majority of the pictures are left untouched, unchanged, and the strangeness of our 'out of context' view point of them does plenty of the work in revving up our imaginations and creating in our minds an uncanny world of peculiar children, in a peculiar orphanage, somewhere on a peculiar island in Wales.<br /><br />This is Ransom Riggs first novel and I applaud him for his imaginative invention of a world centered around atypical and even eccentric photos from the past.
B0015OKWL2|2.0|I was immediately struck by how miscast the two stars were - both too old to be playing cops, especially Pacino. The second immediate impact was how unrealistic the plot was - that 14 murders of criminals who had gotten off would have succeeded. It was obvious almost from the start that a cop had to be doing the killing. The third point that will strike viewers is that the supposed killer, De Niro, was too obvious, and it had to be someone else.

B0041C09Y0|1.0|The first show was compelling and had me hooked but now, well into the third season, I am deeply disappointed in how the show has panned out.  I think the actors do their best with the godawful writing.  Surprisingly the supporting cast is far better than the leads.<br /><br />Charlie Hunnam, as Jax Teller, looks like a rap-rock Kurt Cobain with a junior high gangster swagger.  His part seems forced and seems to says 'bro' every other sentence. The 'beef' between Jax and Ron Perlman's character seems contrived.  Mark Boone Junior, Kim Coates, Tommy Flanagan, Theo Rossi, Ryan Hurst, Dayton Callie and Katy Sagal all do well and have believable characters.  However, some serious character flaws hinder the viewer's ability to believe them.<br /><br />The most damning aspect of the show is the complete inability of the gang to complete any task.  It's just painful to watch as this group of morons bumble through the episodes.  They are unable to settle any scores and shy away from the violence necessary to make them believable criminals or individuals with any spine.<br /><br />Perhaps I became too accustomed with the swift and vengeful or calm and calculated vengeance dealt out in The Sopranos.  Of course, a motorcycle gang has a different modus operandi and doesn't attempt to blend in like a mafia group which may limit their abilities to carry out violent acts in public seeing as how they ride loud motorcycles and wear identification on their kuttes.<br /><br />It's intensely painful to watch as the gang gets shit on over and over with only half-assed attempts at getting even or preventing future danger befall them and their loved ones.  Their revolving grudges and alliances with rival gangs makes my head spin.<br /><br />Basically, if the Sons of Anarchy ever were a successful criminal operation that time has long passed by the time this show begins.  Their internal struggles and inability to stick with any given plan or path of action just creates agitation and disappointment for the viewer.  It's like watching a gang comprised of gullible children who, episode after episode, engage in the same ridiculous squabbles while repeatedly forgetting about those who pose a true danger to their future.  It amounts to a story with a lack of credibility and consistent disappointment.ointment for the viewer.

B004LWZW8I|2.0|Special affects are ok, but the story line is flimsy to the point of vanishing. It bears only a passing resemblence to any mythology I have ever read, and that passing resemblence is only because it uses some of the \\"gods\\" names and characters. Beyond that, even Thor is more true to the myth/legend, and that is a stretch to say the least. If you are looking for a story from Greek or Roman mythology or history, keep looking. This aint it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|While I'm a big fan of hunger games... I wasn't overly thrilled with this addition.<br /><br />There are a two primary  reasons why:<br />1. Suzanne switches gears on us with this book. The series had blended well earlier and flowed, but it seemed out of sorts that she all of a sudden wanted to end with a morality lesson on war and that even its survivors lose something(along with a nice little dig that no side is guilt free). That's a true point, but it doesn't sync well with the first two books that allowed the protagonist to exist in a world where frankly she would have been put down relatively quickly. If Suzanne's goal was really to accomplish what she wrote in the last book, the first two needed to be far different.<br /><br />2. The second half of the book felt horribly rushed. Aside from the stupidity of having the cqb in the city take on an element of the arena, the writing itself was disjointed and lackluster. It didn't flow well... And since it was so jerky the author didn't really have the chance to invest in the story other than to kill off a few people and wham we are standing in front of the mansion.<br /><br />It's great that Suzanne brought some life lessons into her story... But they just don't coexist well with her first two books in the series. Hopefully in future books she doesn't cram endings the way she did with Mockingjay. If you need the space, add on an extra book. I'm sure we'd all happily pick that one up as well.<br /><br />Regardless, it's still a must read as a cap stone on the trilogy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|While everyone seems to be hung up on the BDSM aspect of this series.  I was not.  To me, this was the background to the story.  I saw it as a story of innocence and power.  Christian represents strength, power, and wealth.  Ana is naive and innocent.  Throughout the books you come to realize the old saying that what you see isn't what you get, meaning how someone seems on the outside isn't necessarily who they are.  Both Ana and Christian are relatable characters through their strenghts and weaknesses.  Christian shows his vulnerability and \\"softer\\" side, and Ana her strength and determination.<br />  I feel like the people that are hung up on the sex and BDSM of the series are truely missing the point of the books.
1416972242|4.0|Hmm, it's always hard to review a series, because I feel like I've already said a lot in my review of the first book. This one picks up maybe a week (almost a week) after the last one. The start felt kind of random and all over the place. We read everyone's POV - Clary, Simon, and Jace. It starts mostly with Jace fighting with Maryse and leaving the Institute to look for a fight because he's feeling hurt and miserable.<br /><br />Then the plot kind of starts. When I think back, I can only think of a bunch of random events happening. I just felt the book didn't connect very well. Hmm, how do I say this? So all the events do lead up to final showdown and whatnot, but they felt like individual threads that didn't relate to each other until the end. The effect was that I could put down the book whenever I want since each chapter is separated from the other. It wasn't an on the edge of my seat kind of thing like from the last book where one chapter rushed into another. No, this one just didn't feel that put together.<br /><br />Despite that, I still really enjoyed it. It moved at a fast enough pace to entertain me and I really liked finding out Clary's power. I still wished that she didn't just suddenly become all that special, but Cassandra Clare did a good job of leading up to revealing her power. This might be weird, but I really like Valentine, not in that I support his craziness, but in that he's a very well done and interesting character. His arguments do read kind of logical and very persuasive, if you don't think too closely on it. And he reflects something I read from Shadowfever - \\"Evil is bad that believes it's good.\\"<br /><br />Character wise, I had some problem with Clary and Simon being together because it felt forced. Simon felt a different person from the first book. In the previous one I just took him as a pretty geeky friend, but in this one he took on a bigger role. He's definitely more noticeable. And I should've seen what happened to him. What I noticed is that Jace didn't have that many funny lines. He's mostly very angsty and broody in this one. I'm still cheering from Clary and Jace, because what they feel for each other is very real. I just want to find out \\"how\\" they're not related.<br /><br />While the book ends on a cliffhanger, I don't feel a great need to go grab the next one. I know this isn't a very clear review, but I can't put my finger on it exactly, but while this book did grab my attention, I just can't bring myself to read the next one yet.<br /><br />Ning @ Reading by Kindle Fire
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Great Book. Even better than than the movie. I am considering buying them all. I guess I should have bought the first book in the series  before I purchased the last book first
B004H4XI5O|2.0|The author milks this subject far beyond the substantive content presented.  A masferful wasteland of words with a few interesting insights.
B002GZQYMA|3.0|This cd is just ok for me. There's only a third of the songs that I like, ones you can keep listening to. It was kind of disappointing for me. However, the album cover is visually appealing.<br /><br />I have Black Holes and Absolution, their previous two albums. And they are much better, in my opinion. The Resistance sounds more like a pop album to me in some cases.
B004I8WD7S|3.0|The product, being generous, is as described, but it is ugly. I returned it in favor of an Incipio case. The \\"smoke\\" color is more of a tobacco-haze brown. The plastic is a semi-rigid polyurathane that is both slick and uncomfortable to grasp. It is awkward to put on. It does have a lip on the front of the phone, for those who will put the phone face on a marring surface. Be advised that Amazon will ding you 5 bucks for return shipping, if you find that it is unsuitable.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I Love Adele. What a beautiful voice and incredible song writing. I never thought an artist from this generation would become my all time favorite female musician. I'm only 20 years old, but i listen to classic rock and female musicians such as Stevie Nicks, Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, etc. It is such a relief to finally get a mainstream artist with actual talent! I don't see how any REAL music fan could dislike Adele. She has saved music and deserves every grammy she won this year. I hope she sweeps the grammys again next year! I will forever be a fan!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|This little baby has been sitting on my desk for a few months now. Still works perfectly. Was easy to use. Came with a few plug-ins that I honestly don't use and Ableton Live Lite 8 that I do not use for recording audio but still a nice gem.<br />I'm using this with an Audio Techinca at4040 (microphone) and M-Audio CX5's (monitors) Works perfectly. No complaints about it whatsoever. Doesn't hurt that this thing looks amazing either.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Learning about and being able to be healthy and fit is somewhat of a hobby of mine.  This book as added more tools to be healthy and fit. The book is well researched.  I found it to be an easy read as well as being informative.  Wow, can you imagine a slice of whole grain bread spikes your blood sugar more than a Snickers bar.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|When, if ever, will there be a non-Blue Ray edition of my favorite film artist's finest work . . . ? I'm a septuagenarian with no plans to put out money for a blue-ray DVD player. In 1978 I was knocked off my horse by DAYS OF HEAVEN, then BADLANDS, listened to Malick's friend and teacher Stanley Cavell talk about him when he visited Albuquerque, where Gus Blaisdell, Cavell's friend and mine, brought him to discuss film. Hell, I even read Malick's translation of Heidegger (THE ESSENCE OF REASONS), but was too young, forty, to write about Malick's films, which I tried to do before deciding to write on Kubrick for a dissertation. After twenty years THE THIN RED LINE, on which the now-late Gus and I disagreed, he viewing it as a letdown and I claimed it was worth the wait. Then came THE NEW WORLD, which I am not as sure about though I do need to see it again and again; and then TREE OF LIFE. Give aging cinephiles like Yours Truly a lift (say a word to Criterion, e.g.) . . .<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005HV6Y5W The Tree of Life (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]]

B006JTS5OO|3.0|When I first heard they were going to do a new film I was happy.  The last film Muppet film I did not care for.<br /><br />I like Amy Adams but her role here is a stereo type of the girlfriend role.  Oscar nominated 3 times, she could have phoned the performance in.<br /><br />Was glad to see all my favorite characters.  Did we care of how Piggy looked in the film-not really.<br /><br />Too bad they could not get some celebrities that had appeared on the show or in the earlier movies.  Jack Black?  Bottom of the barrel huh?<br /><br />Won an Oscar for the song. Slow year for music.  Reusing songs in the soundtrack.  Not talking about Muppet songs but AC-DC & others?  Tacky.<br /><br />Extras are ok-all extras like bloopers & making of of course are staged.<br /><br />I will not be doing the digital download for the film nor soundtrack.<br /><br />An OK film-just could have been better.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|It's just as fun as other versions, strangely easier. The only problem I had was the fact that there was a portion missing. My friend has the game on her iphone but she has more games than I have on my kindle. There is a whole section missing.
B000PMG16U|4.0|Well, we all know George.  This is the 1st release of the films to blu ray & it will NOT be the last.  We know he will release them numerous times on blu ray.<br /><br />This set  is for episodes 1, 2 & 3-Menace, Clones & Sith.  No where as good as the original trilogy<br /><br />The only extras are commentary.<br /><br />So, this is you bones bare set-if you just want the three films then this is for you.  The nine disc complete set is better BUT not perfect.<br /><br />Rating for films NOT for package-package would get a 3.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great! easy to use in church and quiet!  no turning pages and interrupting others!  highlighting is easy and comfortable on the eyes
B0071T5PN0|4.0|I was a little hesitant after I heard the first single \\" tattoo\\" but still got this album. I am glad I did, cause it is a great album with the exception of a few songs. Like mentioned in the title I love this album musically but lyrical stand point not my fav. and also Michael Anthony is missed. But at least there is still good rock music coming from these legends of rock.
B007Q914WG|5.0|I really like this episode. I thought the style was a lot like It was when it started. It was an old fashion supernatural episode.
B005KELS6Q|5.0|This fits my Kindle perfectly! I love that it's visible when I walk in the room...no searching for where I left it! It is shipped with a piece of Styrofoam inside; I've left that inside for an extra layer of protection for the screen.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|I try not to read too many Nicholas Sparks books, his books tend to be the same for me .. girl meets boy, one dislikes the other - the other does not, they end up falling in love and then one of them dies.  Well I was at the movies one day and saw the preview for The Lucky One - since Zac Efron is not bad to look at and will probably see the movie but first I thought I would read the book first.<br />U.S. Marine Logan Thibault during his 3rd tour of Iraq finds a picture of a young woman in the dirt.  Instead of tossing the photo away he bring the photo to base in hopes its owner finds it, but no one does.  Reclaiming the photo, Logan carries it around in his pocket and suddenly starts to experience a winning streak .. winning poker games, surviving deadly combat that kills two of his closest buddies but able to save his best friend, Victor.  Victor deems the photo to be Logan's `lucky charm' and once back in the states convinces Logan it is his destiny to find this woman.  Logan set out on foot with his dog, Zeus, on a journey from Colorado to find the woman living in Hampton, North Carolina.<br />The woman in the picture is Elizabeth, a divorced mother with a son approximately 10 years old that lives with her grandmother that runs dog kennel.  And here is where my issue with Sparks books begin .. Logan is handsome, sensitive, and good with kids, just happens to be a great handy man and knows how to train dogs.  Elizabeth is beautiful, a teacher and a great mother.  The ex, Keith, is the sheriff, first family of the town and mean.<br />The story centers on Logan and Elizabeth passionate love affair and the secret photo threatening to tear them apart.<br />The book was a quick, easy ready and ended happy - I enjoyed it but it was fairly predictable.

B001S86J0I|5.0|I have been a Trek fan for years. And I like Galaxy Quest as well. Is it a spoof of Trek? Sure. But the people that made the movie did not try to pretend it wasn't.
B006O5Y09C|4.0|Woody directed the film, but he might as well have been main actor. Owen Wilson was great as usual for this well fitting role. The film was sentimental, funny and charming enough to make any fan happy.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I think the book is not awesme because Suzane Collins wrote the story really slow,so no offence I didn't like the book
0307352145|5.0|I too struggled with being an introvert in a world that seemed to me to strongly favor extroverts.  I often say that \\"I have sun moon and Mercury in introversion\\".  Eventually I came understand much of what the book has to say so not a lot of it was new to me.  But the book confirmed my understanding of introversion and how it works for me and it provided me with a lot of new information supporting my understandings.<br /><br />I did not particularly like the chapter on religious nuttiness and evangelism.  I think that part of the book should have been left out.  If the anthor needed one more example then a better example than some religious nut would do much better.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for anyone needing a better understanding of introversion whether for understanding themselves as introverts of for understanding introverts who are a part of their lives.  Ii highly recommend this book.
B00280LYHS|5.0|The Last Olympian is the most awesome book ever. Rick Riordan is the worlds best author. In this book is the mighty battle between camp half blood and kronos. I highly recommened every book Rick Riordan wrote because his books are awesome.
0307949508|4.0|I  very much enjoyed the book.  It is well written and the characters well developed.  There is enough visual imagery conveyed to really add to the story.  And of course there are some a few good mysteries running together along with some good surprises coming together to make this a very interesting  book.
B003AIEOCY|2.0|I had read a review where they had concerns over the re-mix quality, I must agree they have done a very poor job from a sound quality standpoint. I have listened to the LP a few times and doesn't matter where the volume is set, it hurts my ears. This is a great LP by the Stones, just be sure and find an original recording, not the remastered.
0307959856|2.0|Weak story not very interesting, very repetitious in need of serious editing.  There are many better books in this genre.
B007N31ZBU|5.0|Complex plot, A-list actors, and the director and cinematography of master craftsmen: a formula for success and great entertainment.  Everyone's familiar with this story/film by now, I'm just grateful that it will be restored from 35mm prints and shown in anamorphic widescreen.
073937771X|4.0|I  very much enjoyed the book.  It is well written and the characters well developed.  There is enough visual imagery conveyed to really add to the story.  And of course there are some a few good mysteries running together along with some good surprises coming together to make this a very interesting  book.  All three books in the series are excellent.  I only wish that there were more to come.
0553582038|1.0|This book is so terrible, I can't even get through the plot summary in Wikipedia.<br /><br />Just awful. And this coming from a huge fan of the HBO show. I loved, loved season 1, then I read books 1-3, then stopped 100 pages in to book 4. It has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I would say to anyone, do not read these books. Just watch the show.<br /><br />Ugh

1466401885|3.0|I bought this book because it was recommended by a lot of people for people to read if they loved the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. If you are hoping or expecting this book to touch you the way Fifty did, then you are going to be disappointed.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this book as many people thought that Travis (the hero) was as compelling as Christian Grey was. While Travis was no Fifty, he was a somewhat compelling character. However, the relationship between he and Abby (Pigeon) was not the same as that between Fifty and Ana.<br /><br />The love story in Beautiful Disaster annoyed me. I was annoyed by both Abby and Travis and wished that they could just get it together already. Also some of the storyline had me laughing out loud because it was so dramatic and unrealistic. I also didn't like that everyone seemed to be okay with how much violence Travis inflicted on people. While I had issues with the plot and the characters in the book, I was swept into the story and came to love Travis. I stayed up all night reading just to see what happened. While this is no Fifty Shades of Grey, it is similar enough to the trilogy to make fans happy.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|hey,  big fun,  love it, everyone should try it, all my friends love it, cant wait to see what's next!
B005J4TLN4|4.0|Really enjoyed this take on alien invasions.Finally,a new twist on the genre. Keeping the aliens design simple without cheapening the look was a plus. And even though I didnt understand every word in the dialog,the movie was still enjoyable.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|The book really gripped me from the start and was hard to stop reading. It has an accomplished fantasy world with great characters a fast moving plot with enough twist and turns to keep you interested. I admit from time to time it had cliched moments but overall I highly recommend as one of the best books I`ve read in recent time.
B004LWZW7E|2.0|I watched this based on some raving reviews I'd heard.<br /><br />I was disappointed.<br /><br />Really powerful theme that time is currency. It brings extra meaning to the old chestnut of \\"live each day like its your last!\\"<br /><br />And that's how we meet Justin Timberlake's character: Will Salas. He literally lives as each day is his last as he \\"earns\\" 24 hours of time from his daily efforts in his job. As an aside, Timberlake does a really good job in this movie and is definitely one of its key positives.<br /><br />But other than Timberlake there aren't too may other positives. The movie moves quickly which is good but lacks real integrity. When it is so easy to rob someone of time (just lock your arm in theirs) it should have been far grittier and frightening rather than the overly ordered, almost robotic depiction of the future shown here.<br /><br />Not one I'd recommend nor watch again.

1588167461|5.0|There are few books I've found better than this. This is a comprehensive book with many pictures. They are not in color as others have noted and there are a few things that are a bit on the edge, but the price of this book is definitely more than enough to make up for this. Following the instructions laid out within the pages of this book has helped to craft the look that displays the outward image that I want others to see of me.

B004SEUJ82|2.0|I believe that there are plenty of true stories about the Holocaust that are riveting enough for the big screen. Why make one about a story that is so unrealistic? I don't often review movies so I hope the reader can forgive me for an incomplete and sub-par review but I just watched this movie and felt moved enough to share my thoughts.<br /><br />First of all at the party with all the pomp and circumstance for the German commander when he gets promoted, would they be playing American Jazz? Were Nazi's big fans of the Jazz movement? I'm not even sure how music that 'jazzy' would have been recieved in the States for the time period, maybe I'm nit-picking there. Here is a quote from Wikipedia, took me 3 seconds to look up: \\"The Nazi regime pursued and banned the broadcasting of jazz on German radio, partly because of its African roots and because many of the active jazz musicians were of Jewish origin; and partly due to the music's certain themes of individuality and freedom. For the Nazis, jazz was an especially threatening form of expression. An anti-jazz radio broadcast From the Cake Walk to Hot sought a deterrent effect with \\"particularly insisting musical examples.\\" It's hard for me to believe at such an official and elegant party they would be playing jazz/swing music anywhere in the world, let alone Nazi Germany.<br /><br />Secondly did children in concentration camps have time to lounge about? Were there large area of fence that were not under watch from some sort of guard on foot or tower? If someone were caught stealing they would just get hit in the face and told not to do it again?<br /><br />Thirdly didn't the Nazi's tell relatives that they were gaurding over a prisoner camp, that the people in the camp were prisoners? It seems very unrealistic that the Grandparents would have the details that it was an extermination camp for Jews, from what I understand very few people knew beforehand exactaly what was going on and it was naturally someting that the Nazi's wanted to keep secret. I suppose a spouse of a commanding officer could have found out, but the whole way it came about in the movie seemed fake. Would the wife really have been shaken by the fact that there was a crematorium on the grounds and it was used on occasion? I would have liked to see someting a little more realistic; the husband arguing that they are prisoners and that a lot of people die in war time, maybe the wife buying that for a while and then confronting him when the creamatorium operates day and night and having her say how many criminals are there in Europe?<br /><br />I know the film had an important message and a powerful ending, but I'm not happy that such liberties with reality were taken with this story.
B00008RH1H|4.0|Akira Kurosawa's first flirtation with Shakespearean material, and arguably his best. A loose interpretation of Macbeth, it's stunningly composed and shot, brilliantly acted and, oddly, very leisurely paced. Like a lazy stroll through a moonlit enchanted forest, it blends its more fantastic, mystical themes with a dark edge, setting it all against a hazy, eerie backdrop. Kurosawa veteran Toshiro Mifune is the inescapable center of attention as a power-hungry young general who's slowly, violently losing his mind. His rapid descent into lunacy is vibrant and ensnaring, especially when he's fully lost the plot, dodging arrows in the unforgettable penultimate scene. Although its deliberate, methodical speed left me sleepwalking a few times, that's a small price to pay for the riches it delivers in other areas.
0439023483|5.0|I read all three books and I thought they were great. I think they try to show the futility and the destruction of war and of people killing other people for any reason. But these books also demonstrate that some things are worth fighting for. Very emotional and well written books. Thanks to the author for her work on this series. Katnis is a very complex character. I hope the film is as good as the books were. Suspect that those that have read the books will get a lot more from the movie than folks that did not.
6304711891|4.0|A perfect symphony of cliche and stereotype that Michael Bay's been trying like hell to recreate ever since. Literally every single shot dips liberally from the well of overuse, culminating in an early car chase with a little old lady, a roving gang of bicyclists and a dozen diving pedestrians in the road, no less than five instantly-combustible parked cars and a Lamborghini that leaps through a plate glass window. Nic Cage and Sean Connery, no strangers to this type of picture, freely toss away their inhibitions and embrace the cheese from word one and, along with a straight-laced performance from Ed Harris, somehow validate the whole thing. The dialog would have been deemed too unrealistic for a Hanna-Barbara cartoon, but through sheer force of will (plus a few blatant winks at the audience) it works too. Top of the mountain for the 'insanely stupid action flick' boom of the mid '90s, it's wildly fast-paced and thoroughly enjoyable in spite of itself.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|From the moment I heard the producer, Mark Johnson, discuss the PFC project and saw the clip, \\"Stand By Me,\\" I was hooked forever!  I ordered 7 copies of this CD/DVD to give family, friends, and students  and continue to give them as gifts.  To see street musicians from around the world, from all walks of life and most of them  survivors of tragic cirmcustances such as knowing only war their whole lives, be exposed to the world, for the brilliant and talented people they are, was amazing!  Mr. Johnson's idea, to record them and then to miraculously turn the recordings into pure genius  as it appears that they know each other and made this beauty together, takes your breath away.  It inspires such desire to force peace among all of us who inhabit this planet.  Wait till you hear Bono and others join in the dream. Then to find out that the proceeds from the sales go to building schools and to wake us all up to  the fact of  how many of us do not live freely.  I traveled  to see the touring group in Chicago last month, and now I am fighting to get them to Nashville!!!!!! This project should receive the Nobel Peace Prize in its effort to bring us together through music!
B002TLSSXO|1.0|After reading all of the positive reviews I was really excited to get these utensils.  However, I've used the Slotted Turner twice (both times to make pancakes) and while washing it it started to peel and flake.  Large pieces of it just came off the bottom of the Turner while hand washing it!  I'm returning these to Amazon.com.  I'm glad other people are happy with them, and it's a great idea and they look great...but I'm very disappointed with them.  Maybe I just got a bad batch or something but I wouldn't recommend them or purchase anything from Joseph Joseph again.

0307593312|1.0|I saw this book on two separate lists of \\"Top Books of 2011\\", so when I saw it was available for the Kindle, I decided to give it a shot. I wish I could have those hours of my life back.<br /><br />I honestly can't fathom what others saw in this book. I found it far too long, repetitive, and somewhat pointless. The author gave the same details about people and events time and time again, as though he thought the reader had too short an attention span to remember such things. The dialogue was stilted and unnatural, and I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. The fantastical elements seem almost to be an afterthought and are like cardboard cutouts in their simplicity, with no real fleshing out or explanation.<br /><br />I rarely start a book I don't finish, but I was tempted to give up on this one several times. I pushed through, thinking it must get better, must justify the story and itself and all of the glowing reviews, but it never did. Upon finishing, all I felt was a huge relief that I was finally done and could move on to something new.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book caught my attention right from the start and didn't let go.  The subject matter if pretty violent, but it works within the context of the story.  The book kept me enthralled the entire time.

NOT give us ANOTHER live version of \\"Hallowed\\" or \\"Beast\\"!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read all three books in a week. Thought the first 2 books were great - well written, tense and gripping narrative and good characters. Katniss and Peeta's second trip into the arena in book 2 was shorter than the first, which was probably a good choice since we had already been thru that journey in book 1, but I did feel it was a bit rushed. Nevertheless, book 2 was also good. Book 3 was a complete let down and I feel the author just felt the need to quickly tie up the plot pieces without developing the story or the characters. Katniss's narrative sounds like she's drugged thruout the book. All in all, a great story and read, but be prepared for a fizzle instead of a bang at the end...
B004O3YGMC|5.0|At first this was just a fun little app to play with. Later, I had to do a presentation where my laptop had to be in the back of the room. I just loaded it up with the streamer and used my Kindle to control the presentation. Another time I needed to do work on my computer, but had to leave home. I simply did my diagnostics from my Kindle. I can only imagine how far its usefulness will go from here.

0439023513|5.0|Major film and production companies have duped us into expecting that at the end of any film (or novel), the main character is supposed to come out shining with the gleam of victory, completely happy, in love, and living life like nothing in the past has happened. But, in my opinion, this novel twisted in ways that went against the normal notions of \\"happily ever after.\\" This is extremely realistic and refreshing to me. We don't always make the best decisions, just as Katniss. Sometimes we lie and manipulate others to get what we want, just as Katniss. This is because we are human.<br /><br />The characters were developed well, with the reader learning more about each of them. The Victors, even as statuesque as they seemed, were explored and their true selves were shown. Katniss's mom and Prim were shown for who they were and I enjoyed seeing how they developed from the first novel. Even Gale showed his true colors and his belief system clashed numerous times with Katniss's. The new characters were great as well. Overall, it was a unique, entertaining way to spin the series.<br /><br />I think that some of the people who rated this book poorly saw too much of Katniss in themselves and were disgusted by that. She was not without flaws, like Bella Swan and similar characters. She is remarkably human and innately flawed. Don't hate a book just because everyone didn't live happily ever after.

B00005A46U|5.0|It's not so much in the title track to this LP, but all the other songs combined that showed that Caravan still had writing potential that extended the psychedelia that Pink Floyd had laid out before probably best heard in Day In The Life Of Maurice Haylett.  Even moreso than their first album this one has Pye Hastings Vocals presented in more contemplative moods.  Just awesome.  This middle album of their 3 great psychedelic and souped up(Canterbury Folklore and Jazz) ones should have been so more highly rated.

B005LAIH4A|2.0|This movie was an overly commercial piece of garbage, which has a trite corporations are evil message funny enough, that desecrates a classic book and cartoon.  The original book and cartoon did more in 70 odd pages and 20 odd minutes than this turd did in it's hour and a third.  If you're pro-environment, it paints environmentalists as whiners with no consideration for the needs of workers in their fight against the.. ooo.. evil corporations who are only in it for greed. The book and cartoon in their short time provided a far more complex and far less black and white worldview.  Plus it adds characters and scenes of characters that might not fit the book. Did we really need to see the Once-ler as a kid?  Why does he look so similar to the boy? The first trailers I saw I thought it was the boy who grew up.  And they add all kinds of fluff supporting characters out of generic kids movie stock too.  So much unless padding to add needless details to a perfectly fine story.  Nowhere near the worst Seuss adaptation, but another misfire from Hollywood that tarnishes his name.<br /><br />Do yourself and your kids a favor, get the original cartoon.  And it goes without saying, have them read the darn book.

0439023513|5.0|I would like to begin by stating that I cannot believe this is classified as young adult fiction. This novel touches on the deepest, darkest thematic elements of our psyche. It is incredibly psychologically disruptive and disturbing but I believe that is the intended consequence. However, it is not for the emotionally fainthearted. This novel is gory, gruesome, heartbreaking, and terrifying. It is completely unlike her other two novels, as dark as the underlying themes already are.<br /><br />Real or not real? A question Peeta asks throughout the whole story since his return from torture in the Capitol. I think this is a much more applicable question to the horrors that pervade this last novel in the trilogy. Although it is futuristic, apocalyptic fiction, the deeper thematic questions beg to be answered: Is this real or not real? Are we such an advanced, civilized society that we are beyond capable of committing such atrocities? I think not. That is what left me so shattered and disturbed after finishing this novel. I couldn't sleep. I sobbed for however long, I do not know. The undeniable truth that humans are capable of inflicting such pain and terror on others to secure power is crushing. The shells of humans that persist after such atrocities is heart breaking. This one blows the other two out of the water completely.<br /><br />This novel more so than the other two really twists you inside out. It penetrates your mind and soul by forcing you to examine and face the difficult thematic questions about war, the human condition, and the mind. I think one of the most disturbing realizations I had whilst finishing this trilogy was the desecration of the beauty and innocence in Katniss and Peeta. Especially Peeta. There is no denying that humans are a resilient species capable of withstanding unfathomable horrors but at what cost? At the end of the story, you don't have the strong, spunky teenage girl that stole your heart but only a shell of that person. It's funnybecause although the epilogue delivers the picture perfect happy ending on a silver platter, it seems empty and like a drop in the bucket. It's not enough to mollify the horrors of the events that transpired. It is only enough to barely cover the surface wounds. I think Collins's last words are beautiful, poignant, and perfectly capture the aftermath of these terrifying events:<br /><br />\\"I'll tell them how I survive it. I'll tell them that on bad mornings, it feels impossible to take pleasure in anything because I'm afraid it could be taken away. That's when I make a list in my head of every act of goodness I've seen someone do. It's like a game. Repetitive. Even a little tedious after more than twenty years. But there are much worse games to play.\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Wool 1-5 and I am looking forward to more books in this series. The characters are interesting and I want to know what happens next!
B005LAIH5O|3.0|I was disappointed with the remake of Clash of the Titans. It updated Ray Harryhausen's outstanding stop-motion animation with CGI more soulless than a clockwork Bubo. The plot was stuffed with irrelevant characters, bad acting, and unnecessary 3D.  Wrath of the Titans learned from all those mistakes.<br /><br />This is not to say that Wrath of the Titans is a good film. It is an action flick that's much more interested in rivaling God of War's special effects than it is in telling a good story.  But that's okay, because nobody came to see Sam Worthington as Perseus act.  No, we're here to see the gods pontificate: Hades (Ralph Fiennes), Poseidon (Danny Huston), and Zeus (Liam Neeson).  With their prayers sapped from the first film the gods are slowly becoming mortal, making death a real possibility.  Hades discovers a solution in the depths of Tartarus; by releasing the imprisoned Kronos, father of the gods, Hades' immortality is assured.<br /><br />Complicating things is the familial relationships between fathers and sons. Kronos is Zeus' father, Zeus is Perseus' father,and Perseus is widowed with a son ten years after the first film (John Bell as Helius). He is trapped in the mundane life of a fisherman as a promise to his dying wife to never involve his son in warfare. But that is about to change, because the gods can no longer keep Kronos under control.  War is coming to mankind, whether they are ready for it or not.<br /><br />Cue the giant monsters!  We get a chimera, Cyclopes, Pegasus, the Minotaur, Makhai, and Kronos himself.  Unlike Clash of the Titans, which never bothered to create a sense of dread, none of these monsters immediately appear.  Each is hidden out of sight before making its debut, and we even get Cyclopes Monstervision (a Syfy Channel staple) before we see them in all their savage glory.  Most of them are awesome to behold. The weakest of the bunch is the Minotaur, who just looks like a horned guy with a harelip.<br /><br />There's also the comedic sidekick Agenor (Toby Kebbell), Andromeda from the first film (Rosamund Pike), and Ares (Edgar Ramirez).  Ramirez is nigh unintelligible thanks to his thick accent and his one emotion - a dreamy gaze that never conveys the rage he supposedly feels for father Zeus and half-brother Perseus.  Considering he is a major villain, he simply can't stand next to Neeson and Fiennes without looking a bit foolish.<br /><br />Wrath of the Titan's father/son allegories are rivaled only by Green Lantern.  There's a lot of drama here, but the film doesn't have the acting heft to really make it work. But we didn't buy a ticket to watch good acting, we came to see monsters get their butts kicked and in that regard Wrath of the Titans delivers in spades.  This is a monster film that stays true to the spirit of Harryhausen's vision, and if you squint it's easy to see his influence on the design of the Cyclopes and the chimera. There may be no kraken in the sequel, but it's finally been released.comedic sidekick Agenor (Toby Kebbell), Andromeda from the first film (Rosamund Pike), and Ares (Edgar Ramirez).

B003EYVXV4|5.0|I knew virtually nothing about this movie, and very little about the story. Only what my middle school students told me. Since it was a rainy Sunday, I thought I would check out either this movie, or 'Revenge of the Titans'. I'm still wondering if I made the right choice.<br /><br />I will not rehash the plot or the merits and demerits of individual actors. I will only discuss my interpretation and impression of what this movie represents. Was I glad I watched it? Yes. Would I watch it again? No. Would I recommend it for young teens? No, but the draw of the books will make the film irresistible.<br /><br />This is one of the most depressing, 'pathetic' movies I've ever watched. It's 'Survivor' meets 'Lord of the Flies' in a dysfunctional (or perhaps 'malfunctional') dystopian culture. So how to rate it was my dilemma. Is movie quality based upon plot? This one certainly has that. Is it based on the performers? This movie suffers no lack here. Top notch without exception. Veteran performers teaming with experienced and talented youngsters at the top of their game. Is it based on what is remembered when the film ends? I don't think I want to remember this one. Its story often became too...shall I say, 'possible'? In short, this movie is well worth the two-and-one-half hours running time. I loved it, but I didn't like it.<br /><br />So what's not to like? The frightening realism of just how tenable this post-apocalyptic death struggle might really be in a totalitarian society where life is cheap and entertainment is paramount.<br /><br />The late Steve Allen is quoted as saying our society is rapidly becoming one where 'vulgarians entertain barbarians'. 'Hunger Games' might more be described as a world where young adolescents are washed and preened to be sacrificed upon a depraved society's altar of lust for bloodsport.<br /><br />This movie is frightening and disturbing in what it may well foreshadow. Plasticized talk shows, outrageously dressed gender-blenders, Neo-Roman entertainment spectacles and nomenclature (e.g., Caesar, Seneca, Tribute) as well as teenage gladiators randomly selected to satisfy the bloodguilt of generations past. Also disturbing is the gratuitous (though reasonably restrained) death of both young and older children. Certainly the film plays down the butcherous blood and death, but it leaves no doubt that it is ever-present and merciless.<br /><br />I will recall two things as I remember this movie. One, the foreboding--almost imperceptible--background pounding throughout the soundtrack which ever-reminded the viewer of the 'canons of death'. Two, I will remember that no one around me moved for the duration of the film. It as much captured our attention as it did disturb us with its insensitivity toward human life.<br /><br />That our generation of children will find this film more entertaining than disturbing speaks volumes regarding where our culture is heading. A generation steeped in video-game warfare and computer simulated death will be enamored by scenes where software comes alive to kill, the environment is manipulated through technology, death is a necessary function to satisfy the living, and survival at whatever cost is the prime initiative.<br /><br />As a film, this is one is good. True, amidst the carnage there are glimpses of what seem--by post-apocalyptic society standards--old fashioned. There is human compassion, appreciation for a sacrificial spirit, and of course, there is love. But again, there is that frightening portent of a world where life and death by lottery evolves into a barbaric chess game where even the good knights and pawns must succumb to the power and will of the ever-watching and all-powerful state. A state which will not allow embarrassment, and may capriciously alter its own society's rules in order to promote its own appeasement. A state which provides for and furnishes all it feels its citizenry should own in a game of survival. A state which forces its subjects totake the paths of least resistance in order to live, and manipulates its own to say what it alone wants to hear. A state which has degraded such barbarism that death itself becomes the cause of celebration.take the paths of least resistance in order to live, and manipulates its own to say what it alone wants to hear.

B0073L91MW|3.0|It is an average quality war movie. I think it is despite some accounts a fictional account as I cannot find any reference to such a raid in Norway about radar. As far as the plot is concerned it is a difficult mission of great importance to the war effort. Overall, the story is okay.<br /><br />The characterization was fairly ordinary. There was no one I thought was particularly interesting.<br /><br />If I had to say what let it down, I would say the acting. I thought it quite bad. No one impressed me with their performance. Probably, the best was James D'Arcy maybe because he played a real person who was interesting.<br /><br />The action scenes which are very important in such a movie were ordinary. A crack Nazi unit, I thought should have been able to make a better fight.<br /><br />Overall a better than average TV movie.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|When it was first announced that Diana would join the short list of exclusive artists to perform in Central Park. Diana was riding a 5 year wave of uptrending popularity from her critically acclaimed/platinum album, \\"The Boss\\", to the mega-success of the Chic produced \\"diana\\" album that went onto sell 10 million copies globally, followed closely by what Billboard has declared some 30 years later, \\"The Biggest Duet of AllTime\\" w/\\"Endless Love\\" to her platinum RCA/EMI debut, \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\", it's follow-up the near platinum \\"Silk Electric\\" with the Michael Jackson written and produced single, \\"Muscles\\" to the album that would spearhead this global concert, \\"Ross '83\\". (Diana was already one of those rare artists to have her career be ever stronger in its third decade. The Supremes dominated the charts from 1964-1970. Then Diana's first solo surge happened  immediately in 1970 when the Grammy nominated \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\" would be her first solo #1. Then her movie career blossomed from 1972-76 as she got an Oscar nod for \\"Lady\\" and a French Cesar for \\"Mahogany\\". This next surge began in 1979 with \\"The Boss\\").<br /><br />Throughout the 70s and early 80s, Diana Ross concerts were like love-ins. It seemed no matter what you had felt about her and/or body of work, she had a unique gift to entertain audiences into gleeful nirvana. She had been a pupil of Werner Earhard's \\"EST\\" which seem to draw her even closer to her audiences. I imagined Central Park to be a great big love-in. I had been traveling annually to New York since 1972/73. I had the privilege of seeing her at Radio City a number of times before this engagement. I  thought I knew New York. But a decade later, there were clearly a lot of things I needed to learn. Her audiences were usually comprised of about 60% white, 20% black and 20% multi-racial. Though the Chic produced \\"diana\\" album stayed ontop of the Billboard R&B Album chart for nearly 18 weeks, her core audiences were not black. Arriving at the park by noon on 21 July 1983, the park was already beginning to fill up for a show not scheduled to start until dusk, 6:00 p.m. The audience was already heavily populated with her black and Hispanic fans. Even the normally strong alliance with the LGBT community was not as evident as it usually was.<br /><br />It was an extremely hot July day with a powerful sun beaming down. To keep the burgeoning crowd entertained, they attempted to show \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" on the jumbotron. However, the bright sun made it difficult to always see the screen. Radios were blasting Diana songs. Industrious New Yorkers were selling ice cubes and water to the sweltering audiences. When she finally hit the stage at around 6:00 p.m., the wind was beginning to whip up. The dancers on stage struggled through the wind as Diana's hair blew wildly in the wind. The first highlight was a touching rendition of \\"Family\\" from \\"Dreamgirls\\". New Yorkers knew the cast album, but, were pleasantly surprised that Diana had included this in the repertoire despite all the gossip that Diana had \\"issues\\" with the award winning Broadway show. The wind continues to blow wildly. The audiences continued to mimmick the wind. Wild is the wind! And then seemingly out of nowhere, a dark cloud began to dominate the New York skies. For the first half hour, Diana tried admirably to confront mother nature......only to have the weather make the definitive statement. The rain followed and it only got stronger and stronger. The New York audiences seem to join Diana in defying mother nature. Would the rain \\"Stop! in the name of Love\\" or would Diana urge her audience to, \\"Come in from the Rain\\". Even if you are Diana Ross, you don't mess with mother nature. (I truly believed the rain had to happen to diffuse the electricity of the wild audience).<br /><br />The Supremes medley during the rain ranks as one of her most compelling performances. She improvised brilliantly! She remained true to \\"The show must go on\\" and she created an iconic moment that will forever be branded into our entertainment psyche. (even her staunchest critics could not deny that the lady seemed to get more and more beautiful as the rain poured down. One marywilson commented enviously that her Lancôme make-up did not run at all though the rain came down furiously).<br /><br />The next day, she returned to that stage completely re-energized. The setlist was altered from the day before. Opening with the appropriate \\"I'm Coming Out\\", she was determined to fully entertain the 400,000 plus that either returned for more or decided to join in the celebration now that the show was being rescheduled. Highlights include the second single, \\"Let's Go Up\\" that sounded like a #1 record as the colorful balloons floated up the sky. When she sung, \\"God Bless the Child\\", her conviction to the lyrics rivaled her performance of that song during her 1980 HBO special. This time, it sequed into a scorching version of \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" that may be the most commanding performance of the day. She kept things contemporary offering a fun take on Michael Sembello's \\"Maniac\\" from the 80s blockbuster, \\"Flashdance\\". When she returned to the stage in a breathtaking Issey Miyake yellow ensemble, she made Stevie Wonder's recent, \\"Ribbon in the Sky\\" her own.... underscoring yet another turn of his catalog that begs for her to do an album of Stevie's songs.....she does them so well. As she toyed with her recent Top 10, \\"Muscles\\".....audience participation got very comical. She even got the New York Police involved in the fun antics to \\"Muscles\\". Her solo version of \\"Endless Love\\" was combined with the duet version and it moved the diva to real emotional tears. You could not help but wonder if she was reflecting on the roller coaster ride of the last couple of days or simply touched by the fact that she had kept her end of the bargain, and gave New York one of the most memorable Central Park concerts. Whether you believe the adjustedreport that she pulled in an audience of 400,000 or you believe like I did and the New York Daily News reported that the first day commanded over 800,000 fans.....the fact that 400,000 returned for the encore underscored that she drew the biggest audience ever to Central Park.....a record that still stands today (though the Park Commissioner no longer allows random attendance, and  capacity taps out at 100,00. Tickets are allocated before hand to insure crowd control). This was truly an event! It is hard to believe it was 30 years ago because Diana looks as vibrant today, as she did then. It is one of Diana's finest hours, in a career with many. In fact, nearly 20 years later, she gave another astounding New York performance in tribute to the 20th anniversary of \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" at her pay-per-view, \\"Stolen Moments\\" concert at the old New York Ritz. Clearly, New York is her town and this show proves it undoubtedly. It is finally here and somehow it seems like the right time!
B00756GKBA|2.0|There's nothing wrong with being 53 years old... unless you act 23... which is what Madonna does here. The lyrics are for idiots and the music... well the music is kind of ok, but after you give it a few listens, it gets old. It's totally mindless and silly. With Ray Of Light, she showed everybody that you can do a dance album with content and at least it was about something. But this... this is just like the fast food of music. A complete disappointment.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Andrew Stanton's \\"John Carter\\" is great fun, and deserved to be a `blockbuster.' With some critics inexplicably confused by the rather straightforward \\"fighting man meets princess\\" plot, ticket sales started out slow. But word of mouth seems to be turning the tide, and DVD sales are sure to make this not just a cult favorite, but earn it a spot in the hearts of all science fiction and adventure fans.<br /><br />This epic and stunningly beautiful vision of the world created by Edgar Rice Burroughs has only taken a century to get here.<br /><br />The film has enough in it to satisfy fans of Burroughs and people who have never picked up a Barsoom novel. My pulse was pounding throughout, and I marveled at the imagery on the IMAX screen where my wife and I watched it opening night. (She's among those who have never read Burroughs, but has listened to me babble about John Carter and Tarzan and the rest for long enough that she knows most of the details. She enjoyed it as a fun popcorn movie.)<br /><br />As a lifelong Burroughs fan -- John Carter and Barsoom have always been my favorite -- I have lots of quibbles and some things I outright disliked. Tardos Mors would never condemn the princess worshiped by all Helium to a \\"fate worse than death\\" by agreeing to her marriage to Sab Than. And yet, I can see the cinematic drama in that storyline, and Lynn Collins used it to nicely chew some scenery.<br /><br />Overall, we got to see the sweeping mystery and romance, the pure other-worldliness of Barsoom. It was grand. I'll be back several times before it leaves theaters.<br /><br />My biggest surprise was how much I loved Collins as Dejah Thoris. She nailed this updated version that still managed to remain true, in my mind, to the Dejah Thoris created by Burroughs. In fact, Andrew Stanton just expanded what ERB had written. Dejah Thoris, after all, was on a scientific expedition charting Barsoomian air currents when her ship was shot down by Tharks. And she was familiar with Jasoom because she had studied it with the astronomy devices in her grandfather's palace. She was a scientist, even if Burroughs didn't come out and say it.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch did stellar work in the role written for him. It wasn't the John Carter I know. But this one was entertaining and worthy of the canvass Stanton created for him. I kept thinking he was playing more of a brooding and dark Lord Greystoke.<br /><br />In the end, my reaction is much like what it was to J.J. Abrams' reboot of Star Trek. I liked that movie a lot, and did not resent someone putting a new spin on another one of my childhood favorites, as long as it was careful to pay homage to the source material. That's what Stanton did with \\"John Carter.\\"<br /><br />Call your friends, tell your neighbors. They'll be glad you recommended \\"John Carter of Mars.\\"

B004T2QZL8|1.0|yes unfortunately every app that I have followed on Amazon and Google market,I have found amazon is way behind on updates. on average amazon updates lag one to two months behind Google market, and in one or two cases update never came and re purchased app on Google market. it is ridiculous,pocketcast and apparatus are two apps that are now over a year behind in updates. for this reason I have stopped buying apps from Amazon,I get free ones and if I like I go to Google and buy them., so to be fair my one star is not for this app, it is for Amazon.

B0071WQ7WU|2.0|In response to a couple other reviews, \\"Hard and Heavy\\" is the furthest thing from my mind after listening to Amaryllis...(not that I expected it to sound hard and heavy).  I love all of Shinedown's previous work and wanted to love this album, but damn, this is mostly watered-down stuff here.  The faster paced songs especially are a letdown...very generic sounding.  A few of the slower songs are almost up to par with what I expect from this band.  I feel the lyrics are extremely cheesy and weak this time around and the blatant attempt at writing catchy songs/lyrics is laughable, at best.  Aside from maybe 2 or 3 songs, including \\"Unity\\" and \\"Through The Ghost\\",  I feel this is a very uninspired effort.. almost no originality.  I've heard most of this before, and that's not what I expect from a Shinedown release.  I'm confident they can return to form next time around.

1400079144|4.0|I picked up this book at the airport before leaving Paris.  Upon arriving in the United States, I was almost done with the book.<br /><br />The author, Dan Brown, structured the chapters to be manageable and short when compared to the entire book.  As you read the chapters and transitioned to another chapter, it is like watching an action movie going from one scene to another.  \\"The Lost Symbol\\" starts off intensely and action-packed.  It peaked my interest and kept me reading- going one chapter at a time.  There are some interesting trivial knowledge about Washington D.C. such as the under city below the city.<br /><br />I read a variety of books ranging from autobiographies, fiction, financial books, etc.  My perspective on reading \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is different from those readers who diligently follow Dan Brown's books (e.g. The DaVinci Code, Angels and Demons, etc.).  I can see how some would be disappointed and how some would find this book a great read.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"

B003EYVXV4|2.0|I know I'm the minority, however, having read other reviewers I know I'm not alone in my opionion. Much of how I feel has already been written, but my major complaint was Katniss as described in the books & Katniss on screen. She was supposed to be 16, skinny, dark hair & olive skin, Gale could be mistaken for her brother. Jennifer Lawrence is nothing like that, so I was never convinced that she was hungry for anything, too well fed & rosy cheeked. The choppy cinematography gave me a headache, was it really necessary? I did enjoy Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson & Donald Sutherland. The fact that we weren't hearing Katniss's thoughts also took away from the story. The actual Hunger Games were lame,these events in the book were tense & exciting & I was rooting for Katniss, but I didn't care in the movie. I never really cared for any of the characters & maybe that was the problem, apathy. In the books I cared about Prim, Rue, Gale  & Peeta, but in the movie they were just actors, nothing more. How anyone fully understood the movie if they hadn't read the book is beyond me, but having said that you wouldn't know what was missing. There were huge chunks missing & characters never developed which left a big hole in the story. I won't see the sequels because I am not interested enough. I enjoyed the first 2 books they were both an exciting read, I did not enjoy the 3rd one, for me it bombed.

B0074JODP8|5.0|Okay, so here's the deal.  Boomerocity is such a HUGE Joe Bonamassa fan that, by all accounts, every review we post should just read, \\"Love it. Buy it. Now!\\"  This review is no different.  So, die hard Bonamassa fans: I know that you're either not reading this or you are stopping now and ordering your copy.<br /><br />For the rest of you, with Joe Bonamassa Beacon Theater Live From New York, the guitar prodigy knocks it out of the park yet again with a tremendous delivery of 21 tunes - 6 of them with a little help from his friends Beth Hart (I'll Take Care of You and Sinner's Prayer), John Hiatt (Down Around My Place  and I Know A Place), and Paul Rodgers (Fire and Water and Walk In My Shadow) and all of them great.<br /><br />The DVD starts out with playing an acoustic guitar in a New York subway, trying to earn some money without much success.  No, I'm not joking with you. Can you imagine?<br /><br />As the scene shifts to inside the beautiful and iconic Beacon Theater where the real show begins with an incredible deliver of Slow Train from Joe's latest CD, Bust Bowl. From the opening note on, you will be mesmerized.  Of course, the all-time Boomerocity favorite tune, Mountain Time, is performed on this DVD - this time with a great little blues riff added towards the end of the solo.  I imagine guitarists the world over will be mimicking that lick (or try to) as a result.<br /><br />On the two disc DVD set I received, the second disc (all on the same blu-ray disc) has two bonus tunes (If Heartaches Were Nickels and Woke Up Dreaming) as well as a behind-the-scenes look at Joe visiting with a very legendary artist who shares a tuning secret.  Guitarists will want to purchase this just to watch two greats share notes.<br /><br />So, I've said all of that to say this: Love it. Buy it. Now!<br /><br />Boomerocity.com
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The recent hype around this book made me curious enough to take a chance and give this book a read. About 25% in, I couldn't help comparing Ana to Bella from Twilight, it wasn't until later did I find out that this was originally a fan fiction for Twilight fans --ah, it all makes sense. I've never liked Bella so I guess it makes sense why I couldn't get myself to like Ana, but I did love reading the Twilight series thanks to Edward's character. This \\"Christian Grey\\" has nothing on him. I can get past the whole Dom/Sub thing, ridiculous repetitive sex scenes, and even the lack of vocabulary...but what I can't get past is how poorly written Christian Grey is! He is nothing more than a very rich control freak with an extremely messed up past. I know, I know...he's supposedly hot, but would you really want to be with a guy like that? Suppose he wasn't hot or rich, but has all the same personalities...would he still be desirable then? I sincerely doubt that. Without the sex scenes and the outlandish gifts he gives Ana, there's no possible way his character would be loved by readers. What does that say about depth of character? Not much. Let's call it what is...this book is nothing more than a literary version of porn. I have no idea how they intend to make this into a movie...let's hope this would be the one instance when the movie is better than the book. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Ladies, if you set your desires for a man like Christian Grey...all I can say is - aim higher.

0517543052|5.0|Be Here Now is a classic text on Hindu spirituality that bloomed open like a lotus flower in the wake of the hippie movement. The seed for this book was planted in the mind of Harvard psychiatrist turned Indian mystic, Ram Dass, and was written - with the blessings of his guru - for a Western audience who were for the most part materially rich but spiritually poor. Be Here Now offered it's readers and followers a drug free alternative for attaining higher states of consciousness, while its simple message to live in the present encouraged the pursuit and cultivation of inner peace.<br /><br />The book is split into four sections; it begins with a fascinating personal account of Richard Alpert's transformation from Harvard psychology professor, to LSD spokesperson, and finally to holy man Ram Dass. The second part of the book contains a glimpse at the wisdom Ram Dass accumulated on his journey in India, and the text is accompanied by beautifully hand drawn illustrations, all of which are printed on a visually pleasing brown paper. This section is what the book is known for, and not surprisingly either considering it's strange presentation and mind melting insights. If you haven't seen it yet, then I can safely assume you haven't witnessed anything like it before; even if you hate the book, it will still stay with you. The core book, titled 'From Bindu to Ojas', reads like a secret manuscript that cryptically speaks of a truth found from a far away land. It's pages encourage those on the spiritual journey to abandon their socially constructed ego and to instead dwell in the warmth of the soul, a process only achieved through the centuries old method of yoga and transcendental meditation. Even though the vehicle Ram Dass prefers is Hinduism, he writes of all religions equally and uses Christ, Allah, and the Buddha interchangeably to make his message more potent. This message, in a nut shell, is to feel unbending love and compassion for others, develop constant awareness, and to be present at all times.<br /><br />Since it's original publication in 1971 the book has sold more than 2 million copies and has had an enormous influence on the Western world's awareness of Eastern philosophy and spirituality. I can't speak for everybody, but my copy of Be Here Now is one of my most treasured possessions; for me, it blew open the door to spiritual discovery like a fierce wind, and awoke in me a desire to walk through it. The third section, titled 'Cookbook For A Sacred Life', goes into great detail in explaining the necessary ingredients and various methods for preparing your mind, body and soul for a spiritual transformation. This section asserts that you don't need to go to India in order to taste spiritual fruits, as the fruit tree grows inside you. Finally, the book ends with a section of recommended books for further reading, which are humorously separated in sections with titles such as 'Books to Hang Out With' and 'Books It's Useful to Have Met'. To this day, Be Here Now's teachings shine like the sun and penetrate even the darkest spaces. I recommend it with all my heart to those with an open mind, and a thirst for self discovery.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It's hard to imagine places like Camp 14 still exist today.  \\"Escape from Camp 14\\" by Blaine Harden is a real story about a North Korean defector named Shin Dong-Hyuk, the only known prisoner to ever escape from the living nightmare of Camp 14--considered to be the cruelest labor camp in North Korea.  The author points out the fact that even though the North Korean government denies the existence of these camps, they are readily viewed in frightening detail on Google Earth.  Thanks to Shin's testimony, this book is able to shed light on one of the most secretive, merciless institutions in the world that are the unfortunate reality of an estimated 200,000 prisoners according to the U.S. State Department.<br /><br />Shin was born and raised in Camp 14.  He knew nothing of the outside world, nothing of technology, and accepted the brutal conditions of the camp as \\"normal.\\"  Some of the vicious rules of the camp include being executed for attempting escape, forbidding groups of more than 2 prisoners from congregating, and the unconditional obedience of all guards.  The most striking story to me was the brutal beating of a 6 year old girl to death in front of her classmates for simply having scraps of food in her pocket.  None of her classmates batted an eye; this was the only life they've ever known.<br /><br />Mr. Harden does an excellent job of laying out the context of Shin's story.  His book sometimes goes on a tangent away from Shin's story to describe overall conditions in North Korea to help the reader grasp the big picture.  This book is an enlightening read not just for those specifically interested in North Korea, but for anybody who respects human rights.  Shin's experiences are a first-hand look that will make readers realize the inhumane conditions happening in these labor camps at this exact moment.  Shin's story is one you'll never forget.

1416550518|4.0|I rarely read the NYT bestsellers and yet this is an era that continues to compel me toward romance and cinematic beauty. This book most definitely served up each of those.  Along with Brideshead, Upstairs Downstairs, the Mitford Sisters- I enjoyed the book and could not put it down.  I do understand that all tastes are not the same and I think the book could be considered more of the same or not quite that interesting for people are unlike me and have had their fill of what on a historical basis has been stated many times with the pre- and post World War I - end of an era, ravages of WWI subplots.  Still I loved it.
B005723JSQ|4.0|This is a fun, fluffy book to read (typical Kinsella) but footnotes in Kindle are exhausting.

B004FVHBXY|4.0|Not since the publication of [[ASIN:1619492326 The Interpretation of Dreams]] have dreams seemed so alien as they do in this film.  The story plays-off of ideas of lucid / shared dreaming that are found in earlier films such as [[ASIN:6305869103 Dreamscape]] and [[ASIN:B0000AOX0E The Serpent and the Rainbow]].  However, in the present movie, the objective is not to kill the dreamer (DREAMSCAPE) or to scare / harrass the dreamer (SERPENT / RAINBOW) but, rather, the goal is to manipulate the dreamer & make the individual reveal their secrets.<br /><br />The mechanism for being able to get into other people's dreams is left ambiguous & is largely beside the point.  This is much more of a \\"What if?\\" sort of movie rather that one that tries to have a plausible explanation for something that is far-fetched.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a story that Freud & Jung would have gone bonkers over, this film might just be for you.  Whether you like it or dislike it (and I'm sure there are many who will not care for this movie as it is rather bizarre), one thing you cannot accuse the film of being is a predictable formula movie the likes of which Hollywood churns out by the dozens.  It may also be useful to remember the adage of the poet Edgar Allen Poe:  \\"All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.\\"

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book, branded \\"Mommy Porn\\" by the Media, is the hottest ticket in town - lots of luck finding a copy! I downloaded it to my \\"Kindle,\\" and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the heat generated did not cause my \\"Kindle\\" to smoke (although while I was reading, I did think of taking up a different kind of smoking!), so not to worry. Those of you who read and respond to my reviews, know I'm not necessarily a fan of Romance novels (although I try to be as unbiased as possible), but adding some erotica makes a huge difference (pun intended - you'll get it when you read the book)! Is it great literature? No! Is it amazingly well written? No - and this is a common complaint -  but since it's written from the view of a naive, twenty-one year-old, I don't care that our heroine refers to her vagina as \\"down there\\" - at least she doesn't call it her vajayjay! Should you read it while driving your car waiting for the light to turn green? I wouldn't recommend it - draw a nice, hot, bubble bath, lock the door, and send those precious kiddies to bed early! Is it fun? Hell, yeah! Will it make a good movie? Well, we'll see by next year, since it was just announced last week. I don't know much about either porn or erotica (is there much of a difference?), but I do know that if this book could take out the trash, it would render a man obsolete (yes, I know women also take out the trash - but why?)! So I say, jump on the band wagon (or your significant other),check your 'goodie drawer,' and ladies, I know you have one, don't analyze too much, and just enjoy the ride (insert obvious sex joke here)!

B00005NWLO|5.0|This is a great \\"live\\" album.  I put \\"live\\" in italics, because there is apparently much debate about how much these songs were subsequently \\"sweetened\\" and \\"fine tuned\\" in the studio post-concert.  Maybe that was a good debate to have in the late 1970s, but now, who cares?  It sounds really good, so I listen to it.<br /><br />I think these \\"live\\" versions blow the original \\"studio\\" versions away.  My favorite tracks are \\"Saturday Night Special\\", \\"Searchin'\\", \\"Travelin Man\\", \\"Needle and the Spoon\\", \\"Simple Man\\", \\"I Ain't the One\\" and \\"Gimme Back My Bullets\\".<br /><br />There is a power and dynamic to these songs that I don't find on the original, more familiar studio versions that we have all heard over and over again.  The sound quality is superb.  This is an album you can play very loud.  If you are new to this band, get a hits compilation.  Otherwise, the sound quality is great, the songs have a power they don't have in the studio, well worth the money.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This game constantly freezes on the galaxy nexus. I can't get past level four.  its a fun game so I would really like it if it was fixed.
B0009IW9DE|4.0|I am very familiar with this album, having had the LP when I was a kid in the late 1980's.  To my 11 year-old (at that time) ears, I really liked the first two singles, \\"Paper in Fire\\" and \\"Cherry Bomb\\".  The rest of the album I liked, but this one did not get a lot of playing time from me, back then.  Time, and age, have revealed why.  These are lyrics and music written by someone in their mid-30's.  Many of the songs feel like they could be written about now (\\"Empty Hands\\", \\"Down and Out in Paradise\\") while others are clearly the reflections of an adult man who has realized time is passing by quickly (\\"Check it Out\\", \\"The Real Life\\").  In other words, this isn't stuff for 11 year-olds.<br /><br />The remastering of this is good, not great.  It's an improvement over the LP and original CD (owned both).  The lyrics hold up over time; in fact, I can identify with what he is trying to say now, in my mid-30's, more than I ever could at 11 or 12.  If Scarecrow was about the fading away of farm life and the American Midwest, this one is about growing up, being an adult and facing the fact that life gets harder, not easier, as you get older.<br /><br />There really isn't one bad song on this album.  My only real complaint is the over-use of the accordian on this one.  Every song has an accordian.  It works on \\"Paper in Fire\\", it gives a hook on \\"Cherry Bomb\\", it has an interesting incorporation as an essential element on \\"Empty Hands\\".  But, over the course of ten songs, you begin to get a bit worn down by the accordian sound (i.e. \\"oh great, another song with an accordian\\").  I doubt this will ever get the deluxe treatment, but a stripped down alternate version without so much of the accordian on every song, could really breathe new life into these songs.  However, overall, a really good album.<br /><br />If you are new to Mellencamp, and looking for more than hits, this one and Scarecrow are where you should start.  If you already have an older copy, the remastering makes it worthwhile to buy (yet) another copy.<br /><br />At some point all of this stuff is going to be out of print and only available as some stupid download; might as well add it to your cart now, before you can't.
0312430000|1.0|Seriously, I feel many readers were expecting something along the lines of:<br />1) Argument showing how checklists create efficiency + accuracy<br />2) General explication of how to use checklists, or create checklists<br /><br />Instead you are treated to over-described, over-narrated stories that read as if written by high school English students. The meticulous descriptions, all-too convenient endings, witty observations.<br /><br />Half-way though the book, after yet another story of checklists being used in another amusing example I started flipping ahead to find the section demonstrating how checklists create their effects and how we could make our checklists.<br /><br />Nothing, nada, just more rubbish stories. I'm sure they will be published in a series in some magazine, but I don't need to spend money for it in book form. This book is the equivalent of being stuck at a cocktail party with a guest that is much too amused at his knowledge of trivia, NYT stories, and historical facts.

B0011UJMK2|5.0|This book is the first in a trilogy series starring Leo Demidov.  The setting is Moscow 1953.  Stalin is alive at the very beginning of the book and dies early into the story.  Leo was a high-ranking MGB officer, and his job was to round up trators to the state.  The full extent of Stalin's mass killings in Russia is not really even known today.  I thnk it's safe to say though that thousands and thousands of Russian citizens were killed during his reign of terror.  As a result of that the people in Russia lived in constant fear and would turn on anybody if they thought it might help them to gain some favour with the government or save their lives, even if only for one more day.  This part of the book was very difficult for me to wrap my head around.  This story though is mainly about Leo and his wife Raisa.  At first it's hard to like Leo since he appears to be cold and unfeeling, but he certainly grows on you as you read more of the story.  Leo and his wife face great hardships and the constant threat of capture, torture and death as they search all throughout southern Russia for someone is going around to many areas and killing children in the most appalling way.  No one helps this intrepid duo and they are trying to find this killer while trying to evade capture by Leo's former organization, the MGB.  This book is so wonderfully written.  The tension builds from the first page, and Smith's characterizations are so very realistic.  His uncanny ability for setting his readers right smack in the middle of the Soviet Union during Stalin's reign of terror is so well executed that we as readers can really sense what living there at that time was really like for so many thousands of Russian citizens.  This is an excellent first novel in what appears will be a fabulous trilogy about Leo Demidov and his brave and beautiful wife.

B004HEXSLI|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book for a book club.  Being a meditator and a member of the Learning and the Brain Society I thought this book would be really fascinating.  It might be kind of interesting for someone with absolutely no background knowledge of the brain but for someone with even minimal understanding it's not informative.  Additionally,  Dr.  Taylor does not really elaborate on her personal experience during the stroke very much which is what I really wanted to hear about.  I would say the one valuable chapter would be the chapter that she describes the stroke;  the rest of the book could easily be contained in a tri-fold pamphlet.  Even if the information was good which I didn't think it was the writing was very poor.  It looks like there was never an editor.  I was so distracted by the cliches I started counting them.  \\"Thinking outside the box,\\"  and \\"peanut gallery\\"  are the two top choices but she scatters others throughout.  She also uses inappropriate parentheses, bold type and strange, simplistic, not funny jokes.  A disappointment.

B0052U59F4|4.0|Fabulous read. A really erotic novel. The writing is excellent and you find yourself being really drawn in to the characters and their lifestyle. Makes spanking seem fun!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a fun game except that it gets boring after a while. and some of the games are really stupid.
030788743X|5.0|I loved this book. Such great world building and story telling. I couldn't put it dow read it in 2 days
B0054JZC6E|4.0|haven't had any problems so far. ive actually got this game for my Dsi.its better on the kindle bigger screen and controls aren't too bad.
B005R4KUZE|2.0|Lots of the puzzles were challenging. Lots of the puzzles solutions had more than one way of going about things and even some had better solutions than the ones provided. Really mediocre for having wrong solutions sometimes...
B005LAIH54|3.0|Well, I saw the movie, was amused, and then it was forgotten. A cinematic one night stand. I liked the first one better.
0439023513|5.0|I first saw the Hunger games movies a week ago, I then ordered all 3 books and I havent stopped reading the books until I finished the last one today.  I would rate this book 5/5 stars no question but I wouldn't rate it 20/5 stars like the other books.  I quickly found myself hooked on this book reading about the rebellion and the districts struggle against the Capitol.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />The reason I wouldnt give it a 20/5 like the other two books was the ending.  I understand not having a fairy tale ending but I didn't want a depressing ending.  For example, in this book, it seemed the love triangle was more significant in this one.  I would have liked to have read a part in the book where Katniss chooses Peeta over Gale.  I was personally wanted Katniss to choose Peeta the entire time but when Katniss finally chose Peeta, it was just one line at the last page of the book \\"You love me, real or not real\\".  \\"Real\\".  I thought that was very anticlimactic and I really expected more.  Then in the epilogue, when she finally did have children it was just doom and gloom and the children playing on a graveyard.  What pulled me into the second book of story of Katniss being pregnant right before the second hunger game, it brought life to the second book and made me want to read more.  It didnt bring any life to the third book and left me feeling a little empty.<br /><br />Another part that irritated me about the ending was when Katniss's mother ignored her at the end.  A great ending would have been to have Katniss to take Prim's place at her mothers side in the hospital and have Katniss and her mother forgive each other for their past for Prim's sake.  Then for some comic relief have Haymitch in the hospital dealing with his alcohol problem.  But it seems like her mother abandons her to live a life in solitude.  Katniss is the only child she has left and her husband is dead and her other child is dead.  Even if you are going for a realistic ending why would you have a mother abandon her last daughter?  Even if its put in the epilogue 15 years later at least have Katniss and her mother together at the end.<br /><br />Rather than balancing out good and bad after a war, it seemed like the author made everything bad for Katniss at the end.  At the Iwo Jima war memorial in Washington, there was one soldier who went on to have a good life.  I think the author tried to have everyone have a terrible life.  I couldnt even say that one character had a good life at the end of this book which left me feeling empty.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />I would still recommend this book and it is still a 5 start rating.
032147404X|3.0|I bought this book due to all of the great reviews, and I would agree, it's an easy and mildly entertaining read.  But it was too fast of a read.  I read this book in about an hour, and not because I'm a fast reader.  There's just not a whole lot of substance beyond the author's attempts at humor and perhaps one (if that) solid pointer per chapter.  Perhaps that's why he's written a couple more books....make more money by writing three or four books than put it all in one to begin with?  I also didn't care for the fact that the book is a walking advertisement for certain products:  the last 5-6 pages are just company pages!<br /><br />I walked away a little more knowledgeable about photography, but disappointed that I only learned about 4-5 good tips in more than 200 pages of reading.  If you get sucked into buying this one like I did, you're going to be hard-pressed not to buy volume 2.  This one is a teaser, and I'm not doubting the next books in the series are teasers, too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very fun and addicting! Love the challenge of progressing to next game. Me and my daughter are addicted. Love it!
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|Modanna has created two movies in one.  One a masterpiece and the second a soap opera that looks like a bad made for TV cable battered wife film.  The Masterpece is the romance of Wallace for Edward . A stunning period piece lead by Andrea Riseborough.  Ms. Riseborough makes Wallace a women you can't take your eyes off of. Wallace says she is not a beauty, but delivers the allusion of beauty by clothing and presence.  That is 100% true of Riseborough performanc. When she is on the screen this movie is impossible to turn away from. Unfortunally when the other story line is on the screen all you want is the romote controle to change the channel. Bad Script, bad acting and nothing to make it worth your time.  But even as bad as the modern story line is ; this is a film not to be missed, but only for the Wallace and Edward parts......so suffer through the other half ....it is well worth the troble to see Ms. Riseborough performance.  Her \\"Twist \\" dance at the end is charming and funny and heartbreaking all at one! She gets the 4 stars for her Wallace!  A women a king could not live without!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game. cool graphics. very smooth on my kindle fire. I'm hooked. would definately recommend! even better than Oregon trail.
B007FXLWKW|5.0|This movie is an absolute delight -- and James Marsden is adorable in it.  The animation is GORGEOUS too, especially the scenes shot on Easter Island with all the beautiful egg-motifs and the spectacular candy factory with the rainbow rivers of jelly beans.  This movie does for the Easter Bunny what other movies have done for Santa Claus -- and the Easter Bunny even gets a sleigh like Santa has!  I just loved this movie...and I can watch it when it's not Easter as well, but I will DEFINITELY be watching this one every year on Easter itself from now on.  It's funny, silly, colorful, and is great for the whole family.<br /><br />Definitely worth the price of a rental here on Amazon and also a good investment to buy because you will be able to watch it many times and get your money's worth.  And did I mention that James Marsden is adorable?
0670023329|5.0|When I heard about Shin's account on NPR, I rushed to the local bookstore to get a copy for myself. Simply the most compelling story I have ever read. I am not well versed enough in the politics of the region or North Korea to provide a qualified review. But I am human.<br /><br />This book has deeply affected me. I view food differently now. It has even affected my relationships.<br /><br />I must issue a warning however. The events in this narrative are truly disturbing. It has been less than 24 hours since I finished reading Escape from Camp 14 and I can't stop thinking about Shin.<br /><br />Fortunately, Blaine Harden provides a detailed bibliography for the interested reader which I definitely plan to consult.<br /><br />Truly, North Korea is the world's largest prison and Shin's account deserves to be heard. The Kim family in North Korea must and will answer for the crimes against Shin and the thousands of others who have suffered at their hands. To settle for anything less is simply not human.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Just bought the game and it freezes all the time.  I don't mind throwing money to the developers but doubt they will update this game.  Also hate the fact that I could only get this through Amazon app store, that is a bad business model.  I had to download two apps just to find out that it does not work on my transformer with ICS.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|This movie exceeded my expecations. Rooney Mara is exactly who I pictured as Lisbeth Salander when I read the book. The rest of the cast is also remarkable. A very gritty, well done film - from the faithfulness to the novel to the Swedish localities. Even though it is over 2 1/2 hours long, it did not drag at all and was satisfying from beginning to end.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|Very challenging at level 8-9 and excellent graphics.  The AI has a glitch that allows me to win 90% of the time if I use a weak-side castle and strong-side pawn charge toward the defense's castled king (usually with a knight or bishop sacrifice).  This does not work on more powerful computer.  One feature I really would like to see is the ability to arrange the board and then play.  I like chess puzzles but cannot replicate them with this program.  Can't beat the portability though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it!  Absolutely loved the entire series.  I struggled to put the book down.  GREAT Read! I highly recommend and have recommended to others.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|i enjoyed the book at times i was confused as the story jumped from one year to the next quite often but overall it was worth it
0307956350|4.0|Kate is an ex-spy adjusting to the normal life of a stay-at-home Mom in a foreign land, who finds herself caught up in a mystery. Unable to give up her roots, she can't help but investigate what is really going on. Strong, intelligent, surprisingly trusting for someone who spent years as a spy, she winds up feeling betrayed, not trusting herself, and not always thinking straight when she finds that she is too close to the subject.<br /><br />Dexter is the perfect husband and father, until the move to Luxembourg. Suddenly he is a workaholic, rarely available to the children or his wife. The roles have shifted, after workaholic secret spy Kate gives up her career to follow her husband to Luxembourg, where he is taking on new work. And suddenly the father that used to be at home all of the time is rarely home and a distance falls between him and the family.<br /><br />Further rousing his wife's suspicions are their new friends Bill and Julia, a husband and wife from Chicago. Julia quickly becomes Kate's best friend in Luxembourg, but questions are aroused.<br /><br />This is one of those stories where you are continually asking yourself  \\"what if\\" and \\"what would I do\\".  It shows the fine line drawn through moral delineation and ambiguity. Hear one side of a story and you may think someone is morally bankrupt. Hear more of the story, and maybe what they do is justified, but hear yet more and perhaps you question their motives once again. \\"Morality\\" and ethics are not black and white.<br /><br />While not gratuitous, there is some vulgarity, sexuality and adult situations and content.<br /><br />My final word: This was a fun, smart story. It kept me entertained and challenged. I continually wondered what would happen next, but it was really light and fun. A clever story of suspense laid out in a very easy-to-read fashion. Part psychological thriller, part escapism, part cautionary tale and part pure entertainment, this is a really fun story!
B007MJSYF0|5.0|don't try to compare battle royal and hunger games, they are two different movies.<br />its pretty good remembering it made around early 2000.<br />that's all.

Kronos, watch out, there's anew hero in town!
B0072GPQ72|4.0|\\"War Horse\\"  is Steven Spielberg's adaptation of the novel by Michael Morpurgo and the Tony Award-winning play.  Set in rural England and Europe during World War I, it's the story of a horse, Joey, and young Albert (Jeremy Irvine), who tames and trains him to plow the fields of his family's modest farm.  When the army wants horses for the war effort, Joey and Albert are parted and we follow Joey's adventures on the front, in battle, and undergoing the horrors of modern warfare.  Joey encounters a British cavalry officer, German soldiers, and a French farmer and his granddaughter before an emotional climax.<br /><br />Spielberg has given \\"War Horse\\" great spectacle.  The war scenes are realistic and harrowing in their brutality.  That horses were used at all when machine guns could mow down a brigade of charging cavalry in seconds is testament to the thoughtless cruelty of war.<br /><br />The four-disc Combo Pack contains Blu-ray and DVD versions, a 60-minute making-of documentary, behind-the-scenes looks at sound recording and editing, stills gallery, and a profile of one of the many extras brought in for the movie that details how \\"atmosphere people\\" are cast and why they are essential to a film's believability.
B00785P2QC|4.0|cool love the game. it is addicting.  ive been playing threehours.  addicting addicting. plus I needpoint so I submitted a review.
B001QFYCZM|5.0|\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\"  is the film that catapulted Marlon Brando to movie stardom.  Though he had appeared the year before as a disabled veteran coping with a return to civilian life in \\"The Men,\\" it was this adapation of the Tennessee Williams play that cemented the Actors' Studio alumnus as one of the most influential screen perfromers of the 1950's.<br /><br />Elia Kazan, who also directed the Broadway play, infuses the drama with raw emotion which is far more theatrical than ciinematic.  What holds the viewer is the first-rate performances: Brando as the brutish Stanley Kowalski; Vivien Leigh as the fragile Blanche, more at home in her memories of better times than sharing a residence with her sister and husband in a crowded New Orleans apartment; Kim Hunter as Stanley's long-suffering, ever-patient wife Stella; and Karl Malden as Stanley's pal Mitch.<br /><br />Along with Brando, Hunter and Malden starred in the Broadway play.  Leigh, who played the role of Blanche in the London production, won a Best Actress Oscar.  Hunter and Malden, too, won Oscars for their supporting performances, but Brando lost the Best Actor prize to Humphrey Bogart, who won for \\"The African Queen.\\"  The movie received an unprecedented 12 Academy Award nominations in all.<br /><br />The movie portrays a culture clash between Blanche DuBois, a fading relic of the Old South, and Stanley, a blue-collar, earthy member of the immigrant class.  Blanche is a Southern belle whose pretensions to virtue, culture, and art mask her nymphomania and alcoholism.  When Blanche arrives at the house of sister Stella, Stella fears Blanche's arrival will upset the balance of her relationship with husband Stanley, a primal, rough-hewn, sensual man who dominates Stella in every way.  Stella tolerates his offensive crudeness and lack of gentility largely because of her sexual need for him.<br /><br />The new digitally remastered Blu-ray edition contains the original restored version of the movie, which was never seen because of Legion of Decency censorship.  Special features include commentary by Karl Malden, outtakes, Marlon Brando's screen test, full-length documentary on Elia Kazan, five featurettes, and a 40-page book containing photos, film facts, and behind-the-scenes production details.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok, this isn't my usual cup of tea, but this is a book for all women to read to meet any guilty pleasure. Ana is a strong woman coming into her own with the \\"guidance\\" of control-freak Christian Grey, a messed up sex-a-holic with mommy issues. Their \\"relationship\\" is graphic, intense, and exotic. All I can say is \\"enjoy!\\" But I still feel naughty for reading this book and loving it so much.
B00755646W|3.0|\\"Madonna: Truth or Dare\\" is an up-close and personal documentary chronicling the singer's 1990 Blond Ambition Tour.  Director Alex Kleshishian captures different aspects of Madonna -- the artist, the perfectionist, the shrewd businesswoman, the good bad girl, and the bitch diva, but the movie comes of as a shallow look at the performer.  Kleshishian uses black-and-white 16-millimeter film for Madonna's off-stage life and 35-millimeter color film for her on-stage fantasy glamor life.<br /><br />We see an almost obessive desire to have children and be a mother, scenes that contrast interestingly to the cone bra she wears and the ultra sexy persona she becomes onstage.  The concert footage captures the excitement and glitz of seeing the performer do her thing in front of adoring fans, but as an introspective look at what makes Madonna tick, the documentary falls short.  The only extra is a theatrical trailer.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Whitney Houston at her best.  This album has lots of her most memorable songs.  My family and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0059XTUXQ|4.0|\\"The Iron Lady\\"  is the story of the political rise and fall of Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep) from her modest early years as a clerk in her parents' grocery shop to prime minister of Great Britain.  As with many screen biographies, the movie touches on career high points and, in the interest of maintaining a reasonable running time, either encapsulates or sidesteps the rest.<br /><br />The story unfolds from the present day as Thatcher recalls episodes from her past, with Alexandra Roach as the young Margaret, and her often tempestuous tenure as prime minister, the film's most interesting.  We see Thatcher's rise to prominence in Parliament even as she is ridiculed as both a woman and a newcomer who dares to challenge seasoned members of that body.  She seeks the advice of image shapers who suggest ways to command the respect of her peers and their serious attention.  These include a new hairdo, a deeper speaking voice, and the abandonment of hats.<br /><br />Traditional make-up, hair styling, prosthetics, and contact lenses contribute to an often uncanny likeness between star and real-life stateswoman.<br /><br />Streep's performance is extraordinary and won her her third Oscar.  However, the film itself is kind of old-fashioned in its depiction of Thatcher as stalwart world leader.  We see her triumphs and her modest beginnings, yet there is a sense that we've never really gotten insight into the woman.<br /><br />Blu-ray extras include a making-of documentary and featurettes on Thatcher's husband, Denis; the film's costume design; Thatcher's battle in the House of Commons; and transforming Streep into Margaret Thatcher.  The movie is also available on DVD.

B001FB4W0C|2.0|I wanted to thank Mr. Unland for an honest review and for pointing out the writers' Liberal bias. I too would like to watch a show without a writer's/producer's/director's political views being inserted into the story. Seriously, it's pathetic how Liberals love to jam their political views down your throat even on a fantasy show about the paranormal. This season the writers' had Dean say: \\"Joe the plumber...what a douche\\". Let's imagine for a moment in Season 3, if the writers had replaced a \\"special parking place in Hell for Chaney\\" with a \\"special parking place in Hell for Obama\\". Liberals would be screaming racism. Or how about if the writers had mentioned Rev. Jeremiah Wright and his racist quotes? Liberals would be calling for the cancellation of the show and demanding an apology. Clearly a Liberal double standard. In Season 5, they even go as far as to insert Sarah Palin into one of the episodes! I can't believe no one else pointed this out.  I have watched Supernatural Seasons 1-6 up to this point, and from Season 4 on, it's just gone downhill. I loved Seasons 1 and 2, before the writers' political views were sewn into the story.

B0018QOIXU|2.0|I truly love the voice of this artist and Adele 21 definitely earned the Grammy awards it received.  Because of the excellent quality of Adele 21; I purchased Adele 19.  I was sorry I had done so.  The song selection is poor and depressing.  After listening to it twice, I donated to a local thift store.  I can truly say that I am glad I purchased Adele 21 first because had it been the reverse, I would never had done so.

B006L9B6TI|4.0|very good book, good things to try to get the magic in your life to start working for you.. a bit of a long read, but a good book overall.
B00756GKBA|3.0|*Edit* - The album has grown on me slightly since writing this review. Have bumped it up to 3 stars but still think a lot of criticism stands.<br /><br />I have the deluxe and I've been listening to it for a week. Allow me to preface that I'm not a Gaga fanatic or Madonna hater: she did great at the Super Bowl and I've enjoyed a lot of her past music, but this album just feels \\"off\\" to me. With all of the hype around this album I was thinking it was going to be explosively good.  Not even close.  The only two tracks I like are Gang Bang and Love Spent (but here the second verse: \\"Frankly if my name was Benjamin, we wouldn't be in the mess we're in\\" just makes me cringe). The rest of the songs seem very blah and uninspiring to me.  Girl Gone Wild, Masterpiece and Falling Free are OK but to me are just not that special. The ballads seem to belong to a different album entirely. Odd.<br /><br />I have to say, the one thing that is bothering me most about the songs are the LYRICS: they are very weak and immature, almost like a tween poet wrote them together just to make the song rhyme.  This was getting silly in previous albums (\\"New York makes me feel like a dork\\") but in this album it has gone to a new length of silliness. Its hard for me to really enjoy a song when it feels so infantile and vacuous. In addendum, I feel that interjecting blatant referentials to catholicism seem arbitrary and absurd: we get that Madonna is not a fan of traditional religion (we've known this for years) we don't need to be reminded ad naseum just for shock effect.<br /><br />There are moments of brilliance in a few of the songs but as a whole they are just not working for my palette, either there is way way too much production and grating repetition like in \\"I'm addicted\\" or nauseating lyrics like in \\"B-Day Song\\" dare I say many of these songs are \\"Reductive\\"?. I find myself skipping most songs within a few seconds of play time if thats any indication of how pleasing they are to the ear.If she had kept the unique vibe of Gang Bang throughout the album it would have been a much more progressive album - she was on to something there, it feels fresh, fun and aggressive. As it stands MDNA feels like a weird mash-up of her various styles throughout the years, many of the songs not executed very well at all.<br /><br />Even if it takes me some time to warm up to an album, it doesn't take this long. I'm going to have to say I don't much like MDNA. Sorry Madge your last good album, as a whole, was Confessions On A Dance Floor.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|Say what you want about Mrs. Spears, she knows how to make a pop CD (or at least her production team does).  Britney has \\"done it again\\" after three consistently good pop CD's comes Femme Fatale arguably the best pop Album of 2011.  Britney is not a lyrical genious with amazing vocal ability, we all know this, if you are expecting this (and why on earth would you) you will be disappointed. Britney is a fun, lighthearted, sex-kitten the equivalent of a vacation: going somewhere to unwind, destress and forget about your troubles. Femme Fatale is executed perfectly for that goal in mind.<br /><br />Somehow Britney (and her production team) are able to consistently stay one step ahead of popular music: able to target what is current and integrate newer trends (dubstep) the result always sounds fresh and fun. Femme Fatale is no different. It is a whirlwind of dance beats, sex moans and giggles. And its just fun. It is not deep, it is not inspiring, it is not really that meaningful. But it is FUN and if you are looking for a fun album to shake your booty to this album will satisfy and then some! While other pop stars start taking themselves way too seriously (Gaga) Britney knows exactly what she is: The Queen Fembot Of Fun.<br /><br />From beginning to end, Femme Fatale delivers on mindless entertainment and fun to the highest degree!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose  - The more things change, the more they stay the same  --  Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr; 1849, Jan issue Les Guêpes<br /><br />Les Miserables deals about the same issues we have today: social progress, compulsory schools, insurrections, revolutions, capitalism, socialism, oppressive governments, war, war weariness.<br /><br />Hugo is a great story teller but I have to admit, my eyes crossed during the treatises on the Battle of Waterloo, history of French revolutions and insurrections, history of sewers, catholic convents, philosophies. I reread many of those pages, sometimes a couple of times.<br /><br />The advice in other reviewers to have a dictionary handy and some French history knowledge proved to be very valuable.  I used the dictionary on my phone, which wasn't nearly good enough as many of the words I looked up were not recognized. A good French dictionary would have been a good thing to have, which I did not and so there were large passages (mostly song ditties) that I did not understand.  I spent a goodly amount of time looking up bits of French history on Wikki.<br /><br />Hugo addressed many of the interpersonal issues common today.  Child abuse, child abandonment, love for a child by parents denied custody, estrangements caused by pride and misunderstanding, the loneliness of the elderly and of course, romance. ( I am sure Marius would have been arrested for stalking today.  :-D )<br /><br />The most well known story line is that of Jean ValJean and his soul's purchase by a priest with a set of candlesticks. An incredible story of  temptations and redemption but it is only one of the story lines that will touch your heart.<br /><br />This book is well worth the time to read but be forewarned - it is not an easy read but it will stay with you.<br /><br />It has been stated that the kindle version is abridged.  It is not.  It is an unabridged version.  The book has been subdivided into 'books' - the 218 pagesrefers to one of those.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|This album emerged from the shambles of Mrs. Houston's life like a phoenix rising from the ashes. No her voice did not remain unscathed. This is not the flawless Whitney from the late 80's and 90's. That is unfortunate, but stuff happens.<br /><br />Why 5 stars? Whitney still has the pipes, adimittedly there is a grainy, whispy quality to her voice that will have to grow on you but the quality of songs remains triumphant. What emerged in this album is a mix of sincere ballads and fun freedom and are the perfect mix for where Whitney was at in her life: emerging from a dysfunctional marriage and addiction. Whitney pours so much emotion and sincerity into songs like \\"I look to you\\" and \\"I didn't know my own strength\\" she truly makes you feel and believe she is emerging from the darkness into the light. Whether that lasted for her in her personal life or not, for a shining moment she was there. It takes some time to grow on you, but I can't say that I dislike a single track on this album and that is a rare feat.<br /><br />Besides the heartfelt ballads the other songs are just about being free and fun and happy or letting go of a bad relationship like \\"Salute\\" which is a great and fresh self-empowerment song. I really enjoy this album, maybe because it came out a time where the message and the vibe of the songs fit into tumultous part of my life; but that says more about the music on the album and not less. This album is not utterly perfect, but it IS both authentic and fun. It will inspire you, uplift you and make you dance and at times, cry. That is a triumph.<br /><br />This is a feel good album and it shows that Whitney was feeling good on this album. As the final work by Mrs. Houston it remains a good way to remember her.

B006PTL1QM|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I have no idea why anyone gave it rave reviews.<br /><br />First, Keira Knightley's performance was simply over the top. Her character didn't seem crazy; it seemed totally freakish and weird. It was as if Knightley was over-exaggerating every word and every action. So much so that it was hard to watch her without wanting to laugh at how ridiculous her acting was.<br /><br />Then, the relationship between Keira Knightley and Michael Fassbender (Carl Jung in the movie) was so bland and boring that you could not even imagine the supposed passion they had for one another. Lastly, every time Jung and Freud (Viggo Mortensen) met, I had to fight not to fall asleep because their conversation was beyond mundane.<br /><br />Definitely don't waste your money or time on this film. You can earn more money but you can never get back the 90 mins you will spend watching this dud.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Predictable, monotonous, monotone characters.  The words and phrases are constantly repeated throughout all three books.  The sex scenes are spicy in the first book but I found myself skipping through them in the next two books because they were all the same.  I kept reading hoping there would be an exciting twist or turn.  When there was a twist or a turn the outcome was evident.  All three books $30+.  Buyers remorse.
0465092764|5.0|This excellent book provides a set of arguments to oppose the so-called \\"mafia\\" of string theorists who keep pushing the physics community down this apparent dead-end road. Written with an emphasis on the mathematical aspects of superstring theory, this book provides very interesting background material (outlining the motivations for the emergence of string theory), technical refutation of string theory, and philosophical refutation of string theory. The presentation is not mean-spirited or mocking, rather it's mostly incredulous that string theory has not yet been abaondoned due to a comlete absence of evidence or testability. There are excellent bibliographies provided, and although two of the chapters are heavy on fairly technical material, a dedicated reader will emerge with a greatly expanded understanding of the (not well publicized) problems with string theory, or its quasi-mythical extension to M-theory. The author judiciously quotes well-respected authorities in quantum field theory and string theory to illustrate the ideas that (1) string theory is proceeding based essentially on a hunch from a few very smart and respected physicists, (2) there is no reasonable way to test string theory thus calling into question whether it is \\"science\\" or math, (3) that the apex of this construction, M-theory, is basically unknown and possibly unknowable, and (4) that string theorists are now resorting to evasive maneuvers to save their crumbling edifice when postulating the \\"landscape\\" implied by superstring theory which can't really be expected to predict the \\"arbitrary\\" constants in the Standard Model (and thus cannot be proved \\"wrong\\"). While I suspect that there is something significant going on within string theory, and hope for its eventual success, I keep in mind that the apparent success of the 5D compactified Kaluza-Klein approach also seemed to have something very significant to offer (relating Einstein to Maxwell) ... this book is highly recommended!
0060873027|5.0|I put this one off for so long because it is his last, Crichton's last book.  It's that same sad feeling I get when a series is ending--saying goodbye to good friends before I'm really ready.  This book was his last unfinished one and so I tried to savor it and just read it in bits and parts but is was sooooooooooooo difficult because, in true Crichton fashion, it just races along.<br /><br />In this bio-techno thriller, seven graduate scientific research students sign up to go on an exploratory trip to Hawaii to determine if they want to switch from academic research to private corporate work.  When their trip goes horribly wrong, they have to figure out how to survive in a world that Alice in Wonderland never imagined.<br /><br />This book had moments of absolute horror in it concerning things that are around me every day--pure brilliance!  Just when I thought there was nothing that could scare me, seasoned horror reader that I am, I was wriggling, scratching ad shivering throughout most of the story.  It has caused me to look at the minutia of my world in a whole new way. It is a nail-biter and a breath-holder and had moments that left me absolutely stunned.<br /><br />My only complaint is towards the end of the book when the prose changes.  I imagine this is because of the new author finishing up (which is another author I love!).  The words and sentences became shorter and more concise, not the elegant prose I was used to.<br /><br />And, just like that, goodbye, my dear friend M. Crichton.  You have given me countless hours of reading pleasure and will always be in my top favorite spots.
0783116934|5.0|Before the Soviets realized they had a serial killer and did something about it, Andrei Chikatilo had mutilated and murdered more than 50 of his fellow citizens, more than half of them children.  The fact that this outstanding HBO film is based on true crime events makes it all the more interesting and shocking.<br /><br />I just watched it for the third or maybe the fourth time, and it's one of the best movies I've ever seen - a gripping and remarkable masterpiece.  Like \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" remarkable.  I applaud the entire cast and everyone involved in the production.  The casting couldn't be any better:  Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland, Max von Sydow, Joss Ackland and Jeffrey DeMunn (who just wrapped up a two-season run in an equally memorable role as Dale on AMC TV's \\"The Walking Dead\\" and) who brings to life the eerie and evil Citizen Chikatilo.<br /><br />For fans of true crime thrillers or \\"Criminal Minds\\" or \\"The Walking Dead\\", don't hesitate to order this great film!

B007P3TMW2|5.0|This movie got to me immediately and I was an emotional wreck by the end.  The young man who played Oskar should have GOTTEN an Oscar.  He was appropriately named.  I have a nephew with Asperger's so I know that this young man played this part to perfection.  At the core, it's the beautiful story of a damn good father who loved his wife and son and left this world too early, and how his family deals with that.  It's flipping beautiful.  I don't understand the low reviews from some.
0307592731|1.0|I would rather walk from Mexico to Canada barefoot on the PCT as read one more page in this book. Simply because a writer bares her innermost thoughts does not make it good memoir writing. Strayed describes a scene in the hospital with her terminally-ill mother this way: \\"One of the nurses was a man, and I could see the outline of his penis through his tight white nurse's trousers. I wanted desperately to pull him into the small bathroom beyond the foot of my mother's bed and offer myself to him.\\" Well, isn't that touching? She concludes that section with this lovely analogy of his dispensation of morphine: \\"Sometimes he gave it to her without a word, and sometimes he told her no in a voice as soft as his penis in his pants.\\" Seriously?<br /><br />Strayed begins the book's prologue with a description of tossing a hiking boot over a trailside cliff. How I wish I could stand at that cliff edge and heave this book after it where, using the only words from this book I can find remotely applicable, it might \\"...fall into the lush trees and out of my life.\\"

After the first 100 pages I was hooked.  I finished all 3 in about 2 weeks.  I would recommend this to others.

B000I9TXK6|1.0|One of the more lousy movies out there. It is always interesting to see how non-cowboy/western people believe everything Hollywood puts out there for viewers who believe their spin on things of which the general public know little to nothing about. Perhaps, these viewers believe these fallacies because this is what they want to believe instead of beliefs based on unbiased facts. That being said, the large majority of \\"cowboy\\" representation in this movie is a farce. I mean really, what is Hollywood after here? Reality based on facts is certainly not being represented in this rendition.

B003AQBYUG|5.0|1st off- I own the ALIEN QUADRILOGY, and I thought nothing could be better than that. Well this set takes the cake and then some. I had to have spent TWICE as much on the QUADRILOGY than this IMPORT set and the Quad was used. This Blu-ray set is far superior. The ALIEN movies never looked so good. ALIEN 3 is a crowning gem since the special edition cut is full HD, no skipping back and forth between refined cuts vs non (if you've seen ALIEN 3 special edition dvd quadrilogy you know what I mean). This set is perfect for any fan!! I have the Imported Blu-ray version and it worked seamlessly on my PS3 40GB. This set was so great I marathon-ed the movies- which I have never done. Bravo!!!

B005CMSDLE|3.0|Last night's bargain rack movie was \\"Hanna.\\" To me, this was not a very good movie. Where can I begin? Let's start with the best. The photography was excellent, especially the far north shots from Finland. The rest was good also, but I really liked the frozen north. Beautiful and well done! Also, before I watched the movie, I noticed that the music was by the Chemical Brothers. The Chemical Brothers? One of my favorite electronic acts? They're doing movies? Well, this I had to hear so my ears, at least, were open throughout the movie. I'd say it only barely sounded like the Chemical Brothers, but it was a well done musical score.<br /><br />Alas, now the movie. It was unmitigated nonsense. There's no other way to put it. How does Hollywood come up with stuff like this? A young woman was raised in the far north of the Finland wilds to be a trained killer and aimed at a target. Alas, she was tough, to be sure, but quite a charming young lady. Miscast? I'd say so! In any case, she escapes a planned raid on the Arctic Circle hideout and emerges from a man-hole in a subtropical desert at least 3000 miles away. Trust me. I'm a geologist. Now, does this strain credibility or what? The desert looked like an obscure part of the Colorado Plateau of the Western U. S., but the local quickly changed to North Africa. Alas, I'm already having trouble following this story. Then we find her amazed with electricity and in awe of lights and fans and things of that sort. Okay, it's understandable, considering her raising. However, a few minutes later, we find her using a computer search engine to track down her father. Alas, this is a story I just can' follow. There are so many interlaced credibility gaps that the whole story makes no sense whatsoever. Let's cut it short. She finally kills her target. There!<br /><br />The whole movie is just a fiasco. CIA agents everywhere. People getting killed by the dozens. Chase scenes overlapping chase scenes. Well, there's enough action that boredom doesn't set in but the story has no credibility at all. Fortunately, there was some interesting music and the photography was good.<br /><br />Gary Petersonedom doesn't set in but the story has no credibility at all.

0345522478|4.0|I'm a big fan of the smaller urban fantasy novels that take a magically gifted character living in a mortal world while secretly interacting with a magical beyond normal comprehension. Harry Dresden and Frank Triggaltheron remain two of my all time favourite fantasy characters, and I am happy to introduce a new character into their esteemed company - Atticus O'Sullivan. Hounded by Kevin Hearne is a fun, witty, action adventure novel that despite some a few flaws managed to entertain from start to finish.<br /><br />Hounded tells the story of Atticus, an Irish druid living in Tempe, Arizona with his faithful wolfhound Oberon, who runs his own apothecary of horrors and who just wants to stay out of trouble. The thing is, almost two thousand years ago Atticus stole a magical sword from the Celtic pantheon (the Tuatha Dé Danann) and they want it back, particularly Aengus Og, so when he is finally discovered hiding out in Tempe, it is all he can do to remain in control of the situation, let alone stay out of trouble. I liked the story here - it was light hearted, lots of fun, and complete with a few interesting subplots that progress the story and set up a bunch of material for the rest of the series. That said, there were times where Hounded read more like \\"a day in the life of\\" where Atticus just about his business day by day waiting for the next bunch of supernatural creatures to attack him. This meant that for the first half of the book, there was nothing really at stake, nothing driving the progression of a plot. While this time is well spent world building, and while all the little sub plots come together at the end, it took a lot of chapters before I became fully immersed in the story Hearne was trying to tell.<br /><br />Though I found it hard to get into this story, the time spent world building at the start is fantastic and is what pulled me through those early chapters. I love this world that Hearne has crafted, the way that everything supernatural actually exists and that the strength of their manifestation is directly proportional to the faith of mortals. The idea that beings like the Christian god could not take a form in the U.S. because the mortals of the U.S. have so many conflicting ideas about the Christian god struck me as rather clever, and the same could be said about the rest of the world building. My favourite area of Hearne's worldbuilding is his focus on the Fae and Irish mythology - this mythology is fascinating to me with weird and wonderful names and places, gods that personify human emotions, and planes of higher existence. From what little research I have done, it looks as though Hearne has taken only a few liberties with regards to using Irish mythology to build his world, and it comes of as both authentic and wondrous at the same time.<br /><br />Hearne's characters are well crafted and packed full of personality, helping to make this experience very enjoyable. Atticus is the witty 2000 year old druid who is the object of every females affections, mortal and god alike. You can tell he is a survivor, the way he talk and the way he acts presents an image of someone who knows what to do because he has been doing it for a long time. That he is still able to maintain a healthy dose of optimism with minimal cynicism makes him easy to relate to, but I would have expected Atticus to have more of a \\"I'm tired and getting to old for this\\" vibe around him. For a support cast, Oberon comes across perfectly as the dog who can barely keep a single train of though together before being distracted something shiny, the widow  MacDonagh is the nice quiet neighbour with a hidden wicked streak, and the relationship between Atticus and his werewolf / vampires lawyers makes for a lot of fun. The dialogue between the characters is also a big strength, the speech is funny and witty while remaining natural extensions of each character, and it is never used as filler material or for info dumping.<br /><br />While the dialogue is pretty good, the overall writing is a touch on the sloppy side. Hearne sacrifices a lot of natural structure to increase the pace of this story, making it fast to read but quite stilted. His writing also suffers from being too precise, and Hearne ends up doing a lot of telling rather than showing. This is most evident during the action scenes, scenes that were conceptually well formulated but suffered in their execution. There was no sense of emotion, no building of suspense, just highly accurate descriptions of every single sword swipe and every use of magic. These are not big issues, but they are always present, always lingering at the edge of your mind, and it becomes hard not to notice them.<br /><br />All in all Hounded is a very competent debut by an author who is rightly making a big splash in the fantasy genre. His issues with plotting and writing are minor issues that can be easily fixed, and are made to look even more minor by the strength of the characterisation and world building. It is easy to recommend this book - it is short, sweet, and you will have a lot of fun reading it.
B000060P79|2.0|During the last couple of months, I heard of this French-Canadian group called Simple Plan that has been, over the last decade, very successful in the music industry. Wondering what the fuss was all about, and after seeing a couple of their video clips and promotion spots on YouTube, I decided to listen to their first CD, entitled \\"No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls\\", even though the CD cover didn't impress me. Indeed, it sort of made the group selfish and extremely immature as you see them acting like teenagers partying all the time and making a mess out of some hotel suite. Of course, one must not judge a book by its cover, but still, the cover gave me pretty good hints to the contents of this album, especially in the lyrics which revolve around three main topics: \\"getting the girl\\", \\"every day is the same and life sucks\\", and \\"my parents don't understand me\\". If those themes clearly reveal that the target group for this album is teenagers, then the upbeat and very repetitive soundtrack doesn't go at all with the dark lyrics of tracks like \\"The Worst Day ever\\" and \\"Meet you There\\". Those songs would have been, according to me, more moving had they been accompanied with the proper music to follow those lyrics.<br /><br />As for the content of those lyrics, I soon found myself tired of hearing over and over again stories about guys that want to get laid by girls that ignore them or that their parents want them to grow up, and maybe for good reasons; especially when you read songs like \\"God Must Hate Me\\" where those kids act like irresponsible individuals, something that was pretty relevant through this album.<br /><br />Now some people would find my comments harsh and ill-founded, considering this group's success and how a certain fraction of teenagers love this music. But that's also another problem of this album. It tries too much to grasp teenagers and doesn't try to connect with other age groups, something that the Beatles, The Smiths, Queen, the Cranberries or Oingo Boingo have managed to do. Now of course those groups have nothing to do with punk music or punk-pop and Simple Plan doesn't need to copy their style, but those groups knew how to diverse their subjects, and this is something that Simple Plan should take note. Because one day, the kids who listen to their music will grow up and will have more important things to talk about than getting laid with the most beautiful girl in school and repeating again and again that life sucks, without saying exactly why it does sucks, and trying to do constructive things instead.<br /><br />In the end, I think that Simple Plan is a band that could have a lot of potential, if they indeed tried to grow up in their music and lyrics, and stop playing like some candy punk-pop music group.go Boingo have managed to do.

HOWEVER, it had a few funny moments and when you let go and realize that you are NOT watching some masterpiece that's going to change the face of the movie experience... it was a pretty decent movie.

My husband had never watched, and he quickly got hooked as well.  Mackey is definitely the best of Michael Chiklis' characters, and his follow-up with \\"No Ordinary Family\\" was a big letdown after dirty Vic and his crew.  At least Walton Goggins has moved on to \\"Justified\\" and continued to flesh out the character-type he handled so well with Shane.

0761169253|5.0|Short, short chapters,with illustrations popped in as needed. Great advice. Here is one gem:write the book you would want to read. Or create the business you would want to patronize. Another:look to the writers or business people you admire, deconstruct what they  do, and add your own twist. This is not plagarism(which is taking the work of another and slapping your name on it) but a nod to the way the universe works---all derives from something or someone else. Do not be reluctant to use it. And, be nice to everyone. It benefits you and helps them. I have read it twice and like the Tao I see and get something new and fresh each time.
1469984202|4.0|First off, don't bother buying Wool #1. Just buy Wool Omnibus and save a couple of bucks. You won't just read the first book, you'll be reading all of them.<br /><br />Howey's writing is well polished and puts to sleep any notions that indie writers are all hacks. It's as well-edited as novels of similar genre found at brick and mortars stores.<br /><br />All that said, I found the first three books the most intriguing. (I gave Wool #2 4-stars but, in retrospect, that story has stuck with me.) He bravely goes where Faulkner implored us to go and killed his darlings in heart-wrenching fashion as the story of where and why unfolds. Like many good writers, he put me in the ground and I felt the cold ring of the spiral steps and the dampness of the down deep and buzz of the monitors at the top.<br /><br />I think that's why my interest fell off in #4 and #5. He stopped killing. While it quite satisfyingly resolves the loose ends of silos, I found myself speeding through the text to see where it went rather than savoring the slow creation of characters in #1 through #3.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Wool is here to stay. I'm happy to say I read it before it became a blockbuster and Hugh Howey makes millions.<br /><br />Well done, sir.

B005CM9DX6|1.0|I've always compared Opeth to Metallica in the late '80s. Heritage is the most disappointing album for me since metallica released Load. I returned Load to the store. This is Opeth's \\"Load\\" for me. I will listen to this album about every 5 years to find out if my musical taste will tolerate this album. I'm not going to count on it.<br /><br />I listened to it all the way through a bunch of times. There is no point where I get the chills because of the awesome musicianship or beautiful structure of the part of the song that has been ever present on all previous releases. I've liked each of the previous 2 albums less and less. I do like all of them until now. I did not care for the songs or the vibe. (I have no proper description of the vibe. Either you get it or you don't) The vibe started on parts of Watershed. It was like he took that vibe and made it more boring and carried it through an entire album.<br /><br />Opeth is my favorite band of the past 20 years. My first show I was actually sitting on stage in arms reach of Peter's guitar. I could have easily changed his patches for him. (another story) I've been to many shows at this point. The first show for Heritage that I saw was laughable and a huge disappointment. Between songs they were being heckled for \\"Free Bird\\" and White Lion tunes (that was my addition) It was outrage for having a set of only mellow/less popular songs of course. On the up side, his clean vocals were the best I've ever heard from him. I'll be sitting out for future tours if the set list remains full of Heritage songs.<br /><br />Honestly, I think Mik could write unbelievable comercially viable songs and make many millions of dollars, but that wouldn't be his way. (I'm just saying)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My cousin played this game on her phone so I thought I would try it out and I love it!  Its fun and super addicting!
0345522478|3.0|Atticus O'Sullivan is a very old Druid. As a very old Druid he is expected to have and enemy o r right? Well, he does, in the form of a very not so loving love god who wants nothing more than to rip the sword from Atticus that he claims is his, then destroy him. Of course Atticus can not allow this and with a bevy of Goddesses at his side, a vampire and the Tempe pack werewolves (even a witch or two) he begins his stand against the love god and fights for his life.<br /><br /> I will start off by saying that I had the hardest time pronouncing the names of the characters in this book (even with the handy guide in the beginning) so I will not go into great detail about this book. I will however say that I thoroughly enjoyed it! Atticus is witty, badass and not afraid to stand up to the bad guy. I liked his character, it is hard to find books with male protagonists that are not all about themselves or `chasseing tail'<br /><br />My favorite character? Oberon, his irish wolfhound with whom he shares a telekinetic bond  with. Oberon is loyal and brave but still very much a dog (with a love for French poodles) and the author keeps this in mind when they are communicating, I loved their talks the most, and the end is precious and had me laughing out loud.<br /><br />The action, the wit and best of all, the lack of smut (only hinted at) makes this book one that I wont mind reading again sometime, right after I finish the rest of the series!
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I do love the cover...as a cover.  As a stand...not so much.  I usually don't travel with it but it seems adequate for protecting the screen but when you try to use it as a stand, it is way too flimsy.  The slot on the back is not deep enough to hold it and the cover is just too thin.  If you are going to use it strictly for protecting the screen, it is probably fine but I would invest in the more expensive cover for the stand feature.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this is the mot amazing book ever.... the movie is aso really good.... i gotta say that peeta in the movie is sooooo sexi ;)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app! fun and challenging! I highly recommend it. I will admit tho that it can be kind of annoying. trying to get so much points to unlock the games.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I, as many other fans of GRRM, loved the first three books. Unfortunately, AFFC did not consistently deliver as the previous novels. I enjoyed parts of the book when the action picked up, but these events were too far amd few between.<br /><br />After reading the reviews for DANCE, I am leary of reading it since it sounds like more of of the same. Darn.
B004E3XD1W|4.0|I loved the entire premise of this book!! I loved Katsa - her struggles with who she really was and how her grace worked!! I equally loved Po - I could fall in love with him too (earings and tattoos included). The plot was fast moving and I found I couldn't put it down!! Highly recommend!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i absolutely love this game. i just wish that they would fix the &quot;visiting friends&quot; issues! Besides that i love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has shifted something in me (and many of my friends).. its empowering and lets you wave your freak flag (even if it's a small flag :)<br />It was almost confusing to me why I loved this book so much but I just went with it. Christian Grey will literally make you swoon. The tension is unbelievably hot and the sex is eye opening.<br />It's not just some poorly written erotica or some fluffy written romance novel. It mixes romance with sex and ventures into newer territory with sensuality. I've never read anything like it. And now that I have quietly (and excitedly) told my girlfriends about this book they have devoured them as well. We even took a trip to a sex store to explore a bit more! Embrace it and go for it girls! Your man will thank you!!
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Won't download game wi-fi working just plays preview.  What do u do to get it up and running man o man!
B003EYVXVE|5.0|Although this movie lack some details, ranging from \\"does not affect movie at all\\" to unimportant to medium of importance, this movie still beautifully captured the story of the best selling book, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. The movie is thrilling and interesting. Also, it is a movie that you will not get bored of after watching it 10+ times. Just wish it would come out on itunes or bluray sooner, like maybe may?
B0073U2FB2|1.0|I skipped this in theaters because of all the negative feedback it got. Just watched it and wow.. this movie is indeed AWFUL. Horrible acing, weak plot, bad special effects, the list goes on and on. AVOID!
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Wow! That's what I have to say about this anime.  I was dragging my feet on picking this up to watch but after a recommendation from someone at the store I finally picked it up and I was not disappointed.  This is some good anime watching.  The art is fantastic!  It makes the look of the show raw and energetic and is very much befitting the topic of racing; it's awesome eye candy here.  The story was pretty good too; I would say the story follows the pacing of a summer block buster movie, it's fast paced, not really any slow moments in the story telling.  I mean that as a compliment. The dubbing of this was great, I had no problems with accepting the voice actors to the characters.  All around good watch, I highly recommend.
B005HSL626|5.0|I think this is a really fun game:)<br />Its really addictive and I love it.<br />I would recommend this game for anyone.
B00785P2QC|2.0|I hate having to buy everything at such outrageous prices. I'm not wasting five dollars again and again for a game I bought for free. Ridiculous.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game!!!!!! I recommend this to anyone. good for any age. this game is weep worth the time spent playing
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought this book because of the reviews and I am so glad I did. I love this book, it was so good i could't put it down. I readed it in two days. buy it!
0670022411|4.0|The book starts a little slow but I am getting into it. I don't know if I am just done with witches and vampires for now having read Harry Potter and Twilight and all of the other t.v. shows going on. Definitely interested in where the book is going and I know that I will read the trilogy and enjoy them all! Reading this for book club so it will be interesting to hear others thoughts.
B005LAIGW8|2.0|I can see why the most popular positive ratings rater enjoyed it.. as he says he is 16 if you are older than that you will probably not really care for this film as it's a sequel that has changed the previous movies backstory.  It's not a reboot they just opted to change things like the original deal on how he was cursed and a few other things.  The story was fairly boring as was the majority of the film.  Even the CG had been cheaply done it seemed in comparison to the first film.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the app is pretty good.  however, few of the games are incremental so there is little value in playing a lot of them more than once.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is really fun I like it. thank you for putting this app on the market. I would have never of thought of this.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is my favorite weather app! I've used it for about a year. There are so many features and customizable widgets. Metars are great for pilots too!  The developer provides regular updates that add something new everytime. Thanks for a great app!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i fell in love with these books. i really hope E L James writes more books in the fifty shades series!
B005HSL626|5.0|this was the first app I ever downloaded an is still by far the best!I love it,my 6 yr.old sister,8yr.old brother,dad and mom all are addicted.(did I mention that 13yr.old me is, too?)ha,ha,ha!buy this app!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing cards game..its fun and interesting. i really recommend anybody that love play cards game.. its fun and the time flies when your having fun playing. it seem that ur at casinos playing cards game but no gambling.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I know tons of people (adults and kids) who LOVE this trilogy, and I thought I would too, but I am definitely not a fan. I just can't stomach the subject matter. I love a good, suspenseful, hard-fought good-triumphs-over-evil story: murder mysteries, spy thrillers, Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, etc, but I didn't find any good triumphing over evil in The Hunger Games. Perhaps the next two books rectify that, but I have no desire at all to read them, and from what I've heard (even from fans), that doesn't happen. It reminds me too much of the young boys taken from their families in war-ravaged Africa and forced to be soldiers, trained to murder, ordered to kill or be killed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once I started I could not put down! I also enjoyed the second and third book. By the end of the series, I wanted to read it all again! Would love to read it all from Christian's perspective.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Great show for anyone who loves surprising twists and complicated plot lines. Each time something is revealed, new mysteries pop up. If you're a fan of the show, it's worth having the DVDs to help recall every little detail, as they all seem important later on.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great way to read any version.  easy to use.  love the audio.  makes it so easy during Sunday School and Bible studys.  A must download.

B007Q2N0HA|4.0|BARED TO YOU by Sylvia Day<br /><br />BARED TO YOU is the premiere novel and new release for Sylvia Day's Crossfire Series. Sylvia introduces Gideon Cross a billionaire with multi-corporations and financial investments, and Eva Tramell, a 24 year old woman with a new job and a new outlook on life.<br /><br />Eva Tramell was hoping to make an impression on her first day at Cross Industries, but landing hard on her ass in the foyer wasn't how she had hoped to impress. And worse, the beautiful sexy, dark and dangerous man who rescued her pride was none other than Gideon Cross, owner and financier. Eva's position to a junior ad exec was just what she was hoping for to allow her to break free of her mother and step-father's need to control. But Eva was hiding a painful past, one that her mother was unable to forget and her step-father had paid to hide.<br /><br />Gideon Cross is a man of power and wealth. Along with the money came responsibilities to him employees, his corporations and to the many charities he had chosen to support and back, including one specifically for abused and battered children. But the sight of that beautiful blonde woman landing on the floor was something he would not forget. She stirred something inside, he had long forgotten. Along with his power and money, came the people, especially the women who wanted to know Gideon Cross, but Gideon was one to hold back secrets. And like Eva, Gideon too, hid a horrible past that would haunt him night after night.<br /><br />Eva and her boss Mark worked well together. They became quick friends and along with his boyfriend Steve, Mark tried to ensure that Eva was accepted. The many layouts and presentations together were successful and caught the eye of Gideon Cross. And there was a sexual tension growing between Eva and Gideon that was palpable by the many employees at Cross Industries. Mark took it upon himself to not only chastise Eva but to warn her about the repercussions of becoming involved with an office romance. Although Eva was quick to turn aside all of Gideon's advances, the couple were heading into a relationship built on sexual attraction and need. On the night of the dinner for the Battered Children's charity, Eva could no longer resist the desire and need growing between she and Gideon. But Gideon's quick exit and disappearance from the function left Eva feeling cold and used. She did not want to be his latest conquest.<br /><br />But not all was what it seems. Gideon's need for Eva grows to an obsession. He is unable to describe his desire and need, but only that he is growing jealous of her friendships with others including Mark and her roommate Cary. Cary is a bisexual man and a model, with a dark history of drugs and abuse. When Cary thinks he has finally found love with Trey, he goes about sabotaging his relationship with one-night stands and sexual games. And only Eva is willing to help Cary back from the brink. But she may not be strong enough to save Cary from the disaster he is fast approaching.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva's relationship is filled with sexual encounters and daily affirmations. And the lover's are fragile. There is a hunger for each other that is not easily quenched, but trust is hard to gain. Both have been hurt, literally, and their trust in one another is slow to develop. Gideon admits his need to control, but when he suggests that Eva willingly submit to his demands, she must admit something about her past that could end their relationship. Surprised by his reaction, Eva was hoping Gideon was able to confide his secrets to her. But the nightly terrors that ride Gideon in his sleep only grow until their relationship is threatened. Hoping to ease some of Gideon's pain, Eva suggests couples therapy and is pleased when Gideon is willing to try. But Gideon still is unable to talk about the many demons that ride him hard. There is a family history of pain and suicide, depression and neglect, and Eva is only now discovering that theman she has fallen in love (with); the billionaire corporate CEO; the man desired by every woman; the man who looks more put together than anyone she has ever see is so fragile and in so much pain.<br /><br />Eva's past is hard for Gideon, and perhaps that is one reason he is unwillingly to talk about his own. But when Eva is finally introduced to a woman who was once a significant part of Gideon's life, she is unable to control the hurt, anger and jealousy that engulf. Eva feels betrayed with the knowledge that Gideon is keeping secret much of his past. And it will take a much longer time to learn to forgive and forget, ignoring the giant elephant standing in the room.<br /><br />Bared to You is an erotic story that centers on the relationship between two dysfunctional people, who are both trying to swim in a sea of pain and sorrow. Eva's past is revealed but Gideon's history is one that we have yet to learn. There are many skeletons in the proverbial family closet and hopefully Sylvia will reveal more in her next Crossfire novel-Deeper In You. I wasn't sure what to expect with Bared to You. The first book in many new series can be filled with so much background information, the reader is lost. But I was pleasantly surprised. I am looking forward to Deeper in You.<br /><br />Bared to You was supplied by Netgalley.<br /><br />see all of my reviews at : thereadingcafe.comre corporate CEO; the man desired by every woman; the man who looks more put together than anyone she has ever see is so fragile and in so much pain.

0141182865|5.0|this is one of the funniest books i have ever read.  having been to all the locales myself and experienced many of the same things the author did made it all the more appealing. new orleans is a great city.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you liked the first book you will like the second! Some say it was more of the same but in this case, that was just fine with me!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|even my husband was able to play &amp; was busy for a long time. very easy &amp; like the different options for play
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Might take a few minutes to &quot;complete&quot; each game, but very fun and becomes quite addictive after a little while. :)
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This is the first Garmin I have and it has everything I need.  It is more complex to use than a Polar, but definitely more complete.
0441172717|3.0|It didn't take me long to finish this book. I loved it from the very beginning and I couldn't put it down but I hate the way it ends: like a stupid fairy tale for kids where good characters are rewarded and bad are punished. And it did remind me of another book, much older than Dune. That is \\"Pharaoh\\" by Boleslaw Prus. The Prince =Paul, his misstress=Chani, the sons that don't live too long, the priests=Bene G., etc.etc.etc.etc. Therefore only 3 stars and I don't think I'll buy another volume.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great I like the ability to change your preferance for different Bible formats and additions.<br />Great tool for on the go when your Bible isn't handy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game . love the graphics and game play. like a facebook game for your android. I play the game on my kindle fire.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is very fun and is a good timewaster it is also pretty easy ;) this is recommended to all ages
B0073U2FB2|1.0|****contains some spoilers*****<br /><br />I watched this movie, after seeing how \\"cool\\" the previews were however...do NOT think for ONE minute this movie will be good....it was horrid. I mean, a week hiding and no one grows facial hair, nor does the dead body give off a bad odor...? Come on...the movie was made in a rush, everything crammed into it to make it seem worthwhile. They make dumb choices throughout the entire movie that people facing actual extinction would definitly not make. It is VERY predicatble and about 45 minutes in, I was checking to see how much longer the movie was... I mean, another issue was the guy and his girlfriend fall into the water, and when he comes up he cannot find her, then when he climbs onto the submarine, a flare comes up, and she is ten blocks away on land...What the heck?!?!? As I said, this is NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|this game is very well done but when installed for a kindle fire it wont download so you have to go to customer support but very fun but not many levels so in a sum. this game is ok but a little over priced I mean angry birds is 99 cents or free but no regular version just he come on people
B004SEUJ82|3.0|I would not presume to give this movie a very thought provoking and long review, as it was this story was based on fiction.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed this film, it warmed my heart in many many ways, including forcing me to think what if I were the one on either side of the fence. You have to put yourself outside the realm of reality when watching this film though and realize that what is going on is the author trying to emphasize the holocaust in a fictional manner as these personal events happening in the midst of a tragedy never occurred.<br /><br />My criticism stems from the fact that there were so many family's, so many loved ones and so many lives involved in this human tragedy that the author could have easily written something of a true nature.. The author could have found many stories from true accounts or lets just say, for the sake of thought.. What if the film makers emphasized more that this was based on fiction and not almost sold this as real, I myself had to look this up to find the truth. I would have liked to see money put into a film telling one of the many many true to life stories that were and not a heartwarming story that yanks your heart at the end..<br /><br /> Please do not get me wrong as this is a wonderful story that shows you the what if's of human tragedy but their is no evidence to support that something like this even remotely happened and I for one would like to be told if this were true from the beginning.. It seems that the film makers and author really want to sell you on this story to the point of neglecting to tell you that it is fiction with the only fact being what it is based around. I see nothing astounding in this work, just another film to make you cry so you may say \\"BRAVO\\" in the end<br /><br />I would rather, make a suggestion... Watch \\"The Island on Bird Street\\", it is just as heartwarming (Maybe more) and based on a true story
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun entertaining kind of hard with big fingers you have to pay attention to all games and opsticals in order to win
B002VCR03A|4.0|So I FINALLY got around to reading this & I have to say I loved it.<br />I loved the adventure & the new concept the author has created with Grace's.<br />I enjoyed Katsa & how strong she was (I love a good female bad-ass) & I loved PO.<br />I'd seen him come up regularly in people's book boyfriend lists and was curious...I can see why now!<br />My only criticism would be that some parts could have been fleshed out & / or described in more detail.<br />I'd have liked to know about Grace's & their possible origin & maybe some history of great Grace's in the past. Do one of your parents have to have the grace gene etc. Why do people fear them so much when some of their grace's are harmless.<br />I could also have done with a map to see where everything was ( I found one on the author's page which helped)<br />I would have liked to know why Katsa was so adverse to having children, did she fear her temper or grace or what? I can maybe understand the marriage thing as she hasn't had any good examples and had been under one man's power already. But I did really think she would change her mind in the cave & Po is so sweet...*shrugs*<br />There were some wonderfully written scene's.<br />**************Spoiler**************<br />[Eg When Po is apologising about his Grace, When Katsa is saying goodbye to Raffin (brought a tear to my eye) & When Po tells her he loves her ]<br />**************End Spoiler***************************<br />Great for Cashore's 1st outing & have no doubt her writing will go from strength to strength.<br />The other thing I would say is that this kinda walks the line between adult & YA for me. Definitely for the older end of the YA scale IMO.<br />The closest book series I can think of would be The Study Series by Maria Snyder.<br />I have Fire downloaded & am looking forward to Bitterblue's release.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|This app sucks! It Plays videos fine but first it forces you to post every little thing you are listening to facebook if you want to be able to create a playlist. Why do these companies Apple, &amp; Tootle &amp; Aneroid Have to have to try to know as much about you &amp; try to own you in exchange for you wasting time trying to get apps like this to work? Even trade, ummm, not even close, the control freaks! hmrp!
B005T87QCI|3.0|It's fun when you just start off but it gets too easy. The game is also limited in that it doesn't have too many selections such as the main protagonist and antagonist from the movie. Though I do like Noisy Boy the most, I would still like to play against Atom and Zeus as well as the other bots shown in the movie.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|ok this book was very good.I loved the movie and now I love the book!!!This is a romance story and in some parts its funny!!If u r looking for a book to read on a rainy day or maybe in the sun this is your book.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I never heard of Florence & the Machine before, but I found a cover of her performing Beyonce's \\"Halo\\" which was amazing.  So I looked her up and bought her 2 CD's.  The 1st time I played the CD, I thought \\"It's OK\\", the second time, I played a couple songs twice that I liked.  The more I played it, the more I loved it.  So don't give up on it until you have played the entire CD at least 4 times.  :-)  She has a great voice and very powerful music.
1741798981|5.0|The 2012 Lonely Planet guide to London is brightly written, attractively designed, sensibly organized and chock-full of useful advice for travelers. The guide gives detailed information on all the major areas of Greater London--even on such lesser-known but important neighborhoods such as Clerkenwell, Hammersmith, Shepherd's Bush, and Dulwich--and contains loads of advice on museums, restaurants, pubs, points of interest, etc., for all the neighborhoods it covers. I've been to London several times, and this book managed to tell me about attractions I'd never heard of before, such as Dennis Severs' House, the Geffrye Museum and the Wellcome Collection. There also are informative chapters on Oxford, Brighton, Windsor and Bath for day-trippers, as well as a fascinating chapter on the history of the city. The copious maps (including a separate tuck-in map of the city center) are clear and helpful, the color photographs are lovely, and the \\"Need to Know\\" chapters on transport, currency, etc., are impeccable. Even if you're not planning a trip to London any time soon, you can read this guide, and dream happy dreams.
0545405777|3.0|I think this book is very overrated.  It's not that it is a bad book, it's ok, it's a fast and interesting read.  But all the hype is unneccessay.  The characters are totally unlikeable and unsympathetic.  Katniss is a grouch and Peeta is a stupid puppy dog.  Haymitch is slightly interesting b/c I keep wondering how he survived his own Hunger Games, but no one else even vaguely catches my interest.  Disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After comparing what we'd each read for the past year, my cousin and I decided we had completely different tastes in books.  This book was on her list, but not on mine.  So I bought it and read it.  Now I humbly have to admit that I will need to read more books from her list.  The main character was compelling, the main plot was compelling, and even the subplots were compelling.  I will be gifting this book to all my nieces and nephews who are over the age of 12.  I was surprised at how easily the author made me suspend disbelief and how deeply she got me involved with her teenage super-heroine.  This was an excellent book, and I look forward to another six hours of escapism when I read the sequel.
0393061310|4.0|I had read this the first time in 1995 or 1996, and then again shortly thereafter to engage in a hot debate with a friend over Diamond's ideas.  But I have not been back to this book in almost two decades.  When I saw the updated version, I decided to treat myself to a week with the book.<br /><br />One thing that jumps out at me now that did not on my prior readings was Diamond's total exclusion of any theory that Asian cultures colonized the west coast of America in prehistorical days.  There is so much evidence to conclude that they did, and so little evidence to show that they did not.  The book is a tease, because you keep thinking he will cycle around to it, and then he avoids it again.<br /><br />For example, in the chapter \\"Blueprints and Borrowed Letters,\\" Diamond holds up the acquisition of writing by MesoAmericans as an independent invention.  But fewer than four pages later, he goes into detail establishing all the changes in Sumerian writing from its first appearance through syllabaries, phonemes, etc., to when it became full-fledged, changes in techniques, abandoned styles... then notes how writing just sprang up in Mexico without any intermediate steps.  No explanation for that, eh?<br /><br />While I'm in that chapter, Diamond mentions how the Soviets' acquisition of nuclear technology may have been an example of idea diffusion (they knew *we* knew how to do it, so they figured out how.)  However, the Russians openly brag that they stole our nuclear technology and copied it.  It's no secret how they got it -- blueprint copying.<br /><br />Back to ancient America.<br /><br />In the chapter on \\"hemispheres colliding,\\" Diamond clearly lays out how pottery technology spread from Ecuador (an early pottery site) to the Andes sites in Peru (1300 years later).  Ecuador is on the west coast of America, in perfect position to borrow this technology from Asia.<br /><br />In the chapter \\"How Africa Became Black,\\" Diamond pulls his biggest \\"nothing to see here.\\"  If all ancient Americans crossed a land bridge from Siberia and then migrated south, and the end of the Ice Age blocked that bridge so no more could cross, how do you account for the wide variations in appearance among the groups of living Native American populations?  When you see the south Asian and Polynesian influence in the physiology of some American peoples (rounded eyes, darker skin...), why is that less conclusive than the evidence portrayed for New Guinean people or Japanese people?<br /><br />Of further interest is how the Indonesian people used ocean currents to navigate to the east coast of Africa and all throughout the Indian Ocean.

B001PB3RU8|5.0|I never heard of Florence & the Machine before, but I found a cover of her performing Beyonce's \\"Halo\\" which was amazing.  So I looked her up and bought her 2 CD's.  The 1st time I played the CD, I thought \\"It's OK\\", the second time, I played a couple songs twice that I liked.  The more I played it, the more I loved it.  So don't give up on it until you have played the entire CD at least 4 times.  :-)  She has a great voice and very powerful music.

1451683405|3.0|This book is exciting as a cogent and forceful explanation for a popular readership of something specialists have known for a long time: that our common notions of free will seem indefensible from a scientific and logical standpoint, and don't even hold up well to introspection.<br /><br />Unfortunately, readers who are even moderately skeptical upon hearing that a view of free will they have shared for a lifetime with everyone they know might be completely wrong might want to be apprised of their options, and here Harris disappoints. Harris' argument is hardly new, and philosophers counter it with theories of free will that conserve many of our intuitions. Harris gives this effort--known as compatibilism-- short shrift, so neophytes will leave Harris' book unaware that there are intellectually credible alternatives to Harris' radical break with free will. I find Harris' move here unfair, in the manner of mortgage brokers who sell products their customers probably wouldn't buy if they understood them better.<br /><br />Worse, Harris does an inadequate job of addressing problems in his own theory. He happily admits that we would have to toss out our notion of moral responsibility when we discard free will, but doesn't reckon with anything close to the full consequences of this. For example, why should we keep such human emotions as resentment or gratitude? We don't resent dogs or infants when they transgress upon us. If another human pushes me on the subway, I resent him; if I find he was pushed into me, I do not. The difference can only be that I believe the man who pushed me on purpose-- unlike the dog, the infant, or the man who was pushed--had some free will in the matter. Should we discard resentment, as well as gratitude, as primitive emotions best left behind now that we know the truth? This is just one of many matters he doesn't bother to address, and I can't help thinking that if he did, his conclusions would not be so pat.
0439023491|5.0|ok I did not read the first book the hunger games I saw the movie.<br />so I just finished the catching fire on audio what a great read but really how many rtimes can you put \\"I say\\" in a book!<br /> this drove me nutz when having to listen to a book on tape so If your reading this go & try and count how many times it is said in the book you will be amazed! other than this bump in my road my overall thoughts are great yes it is a little drawn out in the start of the book but once there back in the games bam you get pulled in<br />I am glad I waited to read these books cause I would go nutz waiting for the third book which I will be sztarting tomorrow<br /><br />great book go & read this series
0439813786|5.0|This is literally one of the heaviest books I've ever read!  I ordered it from Amazon after I watched and loved the movie \\"Hugo.\\"  The beautiful 545-page book arrived very quickly, and I read it in three short sessions of less than 3 hours total.  It is full of page after page of lovely pencil drawings that Scorsese used for inspiration in his movie.  Some of the written pages only have a paragraph or two on them, so it's an extrememly quick read.  my 10-year-old granddaughter immediately took it home to read and loved it also.

B004EPYZSU|5.0|If you are into good old cowboy movies, and alien invasion type movies, this combo will not let you down. Normal alien movies take place during the present, so it's fun to see how cowboys of the old west would handle an alien attack.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Yep, it's true. I spend the whole weekend reading all three of these books. I read well past my bedtime. I could not put them down.  Even after finishing the last one (Fifty Shades Freed) and after the epilogue, I can still say they were fun to read. While the author tends to repeat herself during sexual situations and various scenes \\"Please don't bite your lip, Ana. You know what that does to me.\\", I found myself skimming some sex scenes. Book one and two, I read in record time. Book three, I found myself drifting in the beginning (and I was able to put it down to actually work out in the yard!). Came back and finished it. Glad I did. The epilogue is great. I loved how she wrapped up all of the characters. And to finally hear Christian's side of their original  meeting was a hoot. For those who think this is just an erotic sex book, well, you are wrong. Could I read it again? Sure, if I had the time.<br />This isn't  for everyone.  But, for me, it was a fun weekend.....

B004EPYZUI|1.0|The very thin plot exists only to tie the action cutscenes together.  Speaking of which, the camera work on the cutscenes was so shaky it made me nauseous to the point where I couldn't even watch.  The actresses all seem to have studied at the Kristen Stewart school of acting.  I only recommend this movie to people who have wronged me in some way.
B00656C6KK|5.0|This wonderful collection of songs by Doris Day is long-awaited.  Doris Day hasn't recorded commercially in many years, but these tracks reveal her voice to be the same one I fell in love with when I listened to my aunt's Columbia 45 rpm of \\"Que Sera Sera\\".  Her  tribute to her son, \\"My Buddy\\" is a touching rendition of the old standard.  His recording of \\"Happy Endings\\" (included on this CD) made me weep.  You can't go wrong with this CD if you are looking for a beautiful voice singing beautiful songs the way they were meant to be sung.  By-the-way, the cover photos show how lovely the singer remains as well.  Doris, I want more...PLEASE!!
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I got myself this book a few days before I bought my first DSLR camera. And it was a great decision. The book is well written with great examples and exercises. I read through the book and on the day my camera arrived I was able to turn it on, switch directly to manual mode and take some cute photos right away. I had no prior experience with manual exposures and had I not read this book I would probably be stuck on auto mode.<br />Since then I also got his other book, Learning to See Creatively.<br />The photos in the Kindle version are a bit low-res but still plenty useful.

Halberstam's book had me feeling the cold during the coldest winter.  It was an excellent experience.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|I am so happy to have this dvd production of Phantom of the Opera! I was never able to afford to go see the onstage production for the distance and such.. However, I did have the blessing of seeing it with Davis Gaines my one and only time.  I fell in love with it at once.<br />I was greatful for the movie with Gerard Butler because of not being able to go to the live shows. I love the movie and soundtrack still.<br />This live production though at the Royal Albert Hall is so special.. I have longed to see it live again and this is the next best thing to that..<br />Ramin Karimloo has not only this voice so beautiful I can hardly describe it, he also brings a different element to the Phantom.. I have spent time listening to different phantoms on the inernet and each phantom has a different kind of presentation.. Ramin is the closest I've ever heard to the likes of Davis Gaines..<br />Sierra Boguss who plays Christine is my favorite of the Christines..  She brings a beautiful voice, and element in which she and Ramin compliment each others charactors perfectly...  This also would be the funniest Carlotta I have ever seen...<br />I very much enjoy also at the close of the show, the mini concert of Sarah Brightman and some of the previous voices who played the Phantom...  It sort of gives some insight into the different ways each singer approaches the charactor of the Phantom.. I am a very happy Phantom fan! My only question is where were you  Davis Gaines? To have had you there with all those other Phantoms would have been so absolutely perfect!

B0055PGUYU|5.0|I stumbled upon this book and, oddly, it is one of the most interesting books I have read in a long time. The interesting part is the stories of the development of various products and how that relates to habit behavior. Nearing the end the author gets to an approach of how to apply these principles of habit behavior to one's own life. I see the logic of that approach, but it is harder to apply the principles than to understand them! Overall, however, this is a fascinating book.

B006ZZAMWK|3.0|One Direction hail from Great Britain's version of X-Factor.  After delivering their debut effort in the UK, [[ASIN:B006OITIQE Up All Night]] materializes in the United States as a #1 debut album, the first for a group based in England.  Overall, Up All Night is a solid, though not always an exceptional effort.  While One Direction's hope to resurrect the `boy band' seems successful enough (given the great start), the band does not bring anything new to the table and remains pretty formulaic for the most part.  There is a mix of pop, rock, and techno-infused pop, but nothing that has not already been tried.<br /><br />\\"What Makes You Beautiful\\" opens ups the album with a bang with solid production and catchy songwriting. The refrain stands out for sure: \\"Baby you light up my world like nobody else/the way that your flip your hair gets me overwhelmed/but when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell/you don't know/you don't know you're beautiful...\\" Overall, the sound is your standard pop/rock production with an anthemic chorus. Sure there is nothing new, but the `no frills' of \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\" works well.  \\"Gotta Be You\\" contrasts the opener, incorporating more vocal harmonies and slowing the tempo.  The refrain is simple and catchy, though from a songwriting stand point \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\" trumps the follow-up.  \\"One Thing\\" returns to a more mid-tempo groove much like \\"What Makes You Beautiful.\\" The production on the refrain is epic and again the band delivers a knockout punch with the hook.  \\"One Thing\\" is yet another solid, though not revolutionary showing.<br /><br />\\"More Than This\\" slows the tempo again and opens with accompaniment by acoustic guitar. Here, the vocal performances are strong and the harmonized vocals on the refrain are well executed.  The production is safe, yet the safeness is appreciated; tasteful synths are a great touch. The lead vocals soar commandingly on the concluding refrain, helping to secure \\"More Than This\\" as one of the album's highlights. \\"Up All Night,\\" the title cut, is another strong point, increasing the tempo and the adrenaline.  The groove drives and the refrain is archetypically pounding pop.  The production is busy, but appropriate, helping to solidify the catchy, addictive aura given off by the cut.  The first five cuts of Up All Night electrify.<br /><br />\\"I Wish\\" is solid, though not exceptional.  The cut opens rather restrained and ultimately never adds many frills or extra production effects.  \\"Tell Me A Lie\\" is notable for being co-written by established pop star Kelly Clarkson.  The cut is a shade better than \\"I Wish,\\" but still comes off as predictable and formulaic.  It is enjoyable enough of course, but the album could use a `shake up' at this point.  Toby Gad's production helps to `save the day' on the fine \\"Taken,\\" which is `second-tier' excellence in comparison to the first five cuts of Up All Night.  The pace has slackened, but here co-writers One Direction seem the most `true to themselves.'  The cut has more of a straight-ahead pop/rock feel - nothing flashy, but helps to reestablish any lost momentum.  \\"I Want,\\" contrasts sounds by featuring a driving piano line to open the cut as opposed to the clich&eacute; rhythmic guitar. Eventually, the production unfurls to include acoustic guitar strums and an electronic-driven refrain.  Gimmicks, as often as they are criticizable, work well on \\"I Want\\" to put One Direction squarely into 2012.<br /><br />\\"Everything About You\\" makes One Direction `too hip' or better yet `too clich&eacute;.'  The track is only about three and a half minutes in duration, but given the boring, `tried and true' aspects, the performance seems to drag on longer.  Thankfully, \\"Same Mistakes\\" atones for misdirection, yielding a nice harmonic progression, a mid-tempo setting, and some great production features.  The refrain is well written: \\"Or else we'll play, play, play, all the same old games/and we wait, wait, wait for the end to change/and we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same...\\"  \\"Save Tonight\\" adds RedOne and company on the boards as producers, but comes off as more generic Lady GaGa. While the move to include RedOne makes sense for a modern pop group, the effects are less satisfying than one would hope.  Even worse is closer \\"Stole My Heart,\\" which is a bit too techno-infused for One Direction.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B006OITIQE Up All Night]] is a sound debut and does accomplish the job that producers hope to - recreate the boy band and tap into the `tween' fanbase via 2012.  There are enough hits to satisfy and yet there is also plenty of room for growth and expanded creativity.  If you love boy bands, you will be satisfied or fulfilled enough by One Direction's Up All Night.and we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same...\\"  \\"Save Tonight\\" adds RedOne and company on the boards as producers, but comes off as more generic Lady GaGa.

B005OYHF0A|4.0|This book covered everything that I expected for getting code that was previously not being automatically tested under test.  In particular, the focus on making your designs more understandable by making them more testable is right on.<br /><br />The only shortcoming that I notice is in newer test technologies that can aid this process.  In particular, mocking frameworks have come a long way.  They can serve very effectively to break dependencies at test time, without removing them in production and without changing production code.

B00005JN0T|4.0|Isaac Asimov is my favorite sci-fi writer of all times. I have almost everything sci-fi that he has written and have read many of the stories more times than I can remember. This movie introduces Asimov's famous \\"Three Robotic Laws\\" and an early heroine named Susan Calvin.<br /><br />Asimov writes of his interest in robots as early as his teenage years and comments that the stories were divided into two classes; robots as menace and robots as pathos. \\"These charmed me\\"  he tells us of the robots as pathos class in the introduction to a collection of robot stories, To the best of my knowledge Asimov never wrote a robot story named \\"I, Robot\\" but acknowledges he was greatly influenced by a short story of that name written by Eando Binder in late 1938. As a tribute perhaps Asimov later assembled several of his Susan Calvin short stories into a group he named \\"I, Robot.\\"<br /><br />We also meet Susan Calvin in the movie who was a special character favorite of Asimov's and appeared in 10 short stories about robots. Asimov tells us \\"The third robot story I wrote, \\"Liar\\" introduced Susan Calvin--with whom I promptly fell in love.\\" In the movie the role of Susan Calvin is beautifully played by Bridget Moynahan.<br /><br />The Will Smith character, Del Spooner, never appears in any of Asimov's stories to the best of my knowledge. Asimov did have a robophobic policeman named Lije Baley who is introduced in his 1953 novel, \\"The Caves of Steel.\\" Baley is forced to establish a working relationship with a humanoid robot named Daneel Olivaw. The robot, Sonny, voiced by Alan Tudyk, plays a role most similar to the Daneel Olivaw character in \\"The Robot Novels\\" series.<br /><br />Just looking at the movie I found it to be a good science fiction action movie and have enjoyed it more than once. If you find the movie interesting I assure you you'll find the books even more so. I see the Robot series as a prelude to the Empire series followed by the extensive Foundation series.  Counting all of the related books there are presently over 15 and three more, written by other authors, have been added with the approval of the Asimov estate. These books are a grand representation of the genre.all of the related books there are presently over 15 and three more, written by other authors, have been added with the approval of the Asimov estate.

B000VFGSI2|4.0|I only listen to music, I don't play, so I don't know how these Beethoven sonatas were intended to be played. However, Glenn Gould has a tendency to play either fast or slow on this recording. This version surely is a curiosity but as you listen to it repeatedly you get to appreciate the Glenn Gould style. If you want more than on recording of these popular Beethoven sonatas, this one should be one of them.

B002BSHXJA|4.0|This box set is a must for any Beatles collector, especially of the LP format. Packaging details are amazing. From the labels to the spine print right down to the inner sleeves. Sound quality is everything you could ask for. Although I paid too much for this box set ($240.00) because of the overdone hype during its release, I am happy with the whole packaging. Except for one thing- why is there no Yellow Submarine Mono CD? Yes, there were only 4 additional songs on the original LP, that were placed on the mono masters CD. But YS was released in mono in the UK and then re-released in Japan twice on red vinyl. I happen to have both the UK and Japan mono LP's and was greatly disappointed when this box had no Yellow Submarine mono CD. It should have been included in the box. Side 2 of the mono LP also has some great George Martin soundtrack music.  True collectors want everything and EMI had to leave something out just as they did with the Anthology DVD's.
B004EPZ03E|4.0|I used to love the chipmunks when I was little (in the 80s) and the Chipmunk Adventure animated movie as well.  I have two girls (5 and 7) that I have shared these with, and they loved the Chipmunk Adventure movie especially.  So it seemed natural to check this out when it hit Blu-Ray, with a little apprehension.  The last few CGI/live action mixed movies we have seen were just kind of \\"okay\\" at best (\\"Hop\\" and \\"The Smurfs\\"), however this is MUCH better than both of those films put together.  It's a kids movie at heart, don't get that wrong, but there's plenty of pop culture and internet culture references thrown in for good measure.  Theodore exclaiming over a double rainbow (\\"what does it mean?\\") and great chunks from the movie Castaway.  The music is poppy and entertaining and Alvin is up to his old tricks as usual (it wouldn't be a Chipmunk movie without him getting into trouble!) Jason Lee makes a good Dave, and has definitely got the \\"ALVIIIIN\\" yell down pat by now.<br /><br />The story is predictable but not overly so, and has enough action and laughs to keep it flowing.  The movie never really bogs down, which is a good thing, and keeps at a nice pace, despite falling back on an overused shipwrecked type setting.  It's cute, inoffensive fluff that the kids will adore and the parents will tolerate.  Mine laughed through the whole movie, and yours probably will too.

A most satisfying episode, ties up some lose threads, and unfurls others (to be woven, or tangled, in further episodes, I hope!).  So completely delighted with this series, and so grateful to Amazon for the chance to watch it whenever I wish!<br /><br />Still sitting here sniffling a bit -- I seem to be crying at some point during every episode. Yes, it IS that involving, and I usually find my eyes welling up because a character has done something unexpectedly noble or courageous, and after a resounding \\"Yes!\\" on my part I am reduced to wiping my eyes. How I root for these characters, and how smartly the plot and dialogue are written, so that even those characters whom I've despised I have come to see in a more compassionate light (I still despise them, but at least I can see their point of view a bit better!).<br /><br />Long live Downton Abbey!

It's a book about two male chinstrap penguins raising a chick, with the outside assistance of the human zookeeper.  The zookeeper gives them an egg to rear after observing the animals trying to care for a rock.<br /><br />This \\"children's\\" book has nothing to do with sexuality, and everything to do with companionship and adding to an extra beak to a penguin family.  If you see 2 chinstrap penguins it would be difficult to tell male from female. So this story has 2 male penguins rearing a penguin chick, instead of female/male.  Both males try to incubate a rock.  Bless the real life zookeeper for noticing their dilemma.<br /><br />For some people to take this story so figuratively that implies homosexuality, is truly a joke.  Every animal needs love, these penguins are just one example.
1469984202|5.0|This is an excellent book (set of novellas): tightly structured, well written and well paced. Full of ideas and absorbing, and it just gets better as it goes on. Do yourself a favor and read it.

I also love that I can watch the weather in my country and hometown while I'm at school.  so I would recommend this app
B006ZVCQJG|5.0|This edition of Sacred is remastered by Andy Pearce as are the other Dio 2012 deluxe releases, which means, unlike other Deluxe Editions out there, this one isn't simply a volume bloated re-release. Very fine, clean and detailed sound, but just a tad bright. Disc 2 has some wonderful goodies that alone make this worthy of the purchase. Live B-Sides from singles and the Intermission live album which was never commercially available in the US. The packaging is your standard for these editions, a wonderful foldout digipak and an informative booklet stuffed into one of the open flaps. Highly recommended edition if you have the cash. Tracklist below.<br /><br />Disc 1 (Original remastered album)<br /><br />01. King of Rock and Roll<br />02. Sacred Heart<br />03. Another Lie<br />04. Rock 'n' Roll Children<br />05.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game its hard and fun but some of the games are super hard and not all the controls work right but still a good game
159514188X|5.0|I picked this book up for the first time at a bookstore where I used to work, and immediately put it on my \\"TO READ\\" list. I'm in my 20's, I've only been out of high school for a few years, and I've dealt with more than one suicide in my life, so if there were anything offensive or unrealistic about this book, I would jump all over the chance to cut it down. But I cannot. This book was brilliant, it was absolutely heartbreaking to think about the chain of events in life. How many times could you have saved someone, or just made them feel a little bit more hopeful when you didn't? It's easy to go an entire lifetime and not truly consider how our actions affect others..this book really makes you think about it. Every school should require it's 7th graders to read this..intense story or not, this could potentially save lives. It's too easy to give up, this book shows how true that is. Asher came from a gorgeous place with this, I can't emphasize that enough.
0545405777|1.0|Suzanne has taken darkness to new levels. 12 to 18 year old kids forced to kill each other for entertaniment..for example, one kid spearing a 12 year old girl to death. And there were instances were kids were devoring other kids, in previous \\"hunger games\\". Really? Pathetic. Couldn't stand it. Almost threw up reading this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is so different from the first two. It grabs you by the throat & causes your mind to spin.<br /><br />At times I found Katniss obnoxious, but in retrospect, how would any of us feel at 17 years old to be the face & leader of a revolution? Literally the whole country rests in this missions success. She doesn't know who is good, who is bad or who to trust yet she must keep moving forward.<br /><br />There were two deaths in this book that REALLY disappointed me. But two out of hundreds, maybe thousands isn't enough to give this book a black eye. Again, in retrospect, the one that died in the tunnel with the mutts, while heart wrenching, it really goes to show how important the mission was to so many.... Even the ones with so much to lose.<br /><br />It did not end how I expected but I couldn't have ended more perfectly. Because of how it ends, Haymitch gained something he lost long ago. Trust & comfort for our beloved Katniss will no longer ever be an issue.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very easy to play.  format is easy to follow and great to play when waiting.  fast game.  the game fits the screen well
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a lot of fun games. tons of fun on a kindle fire. a little hard to get points in the game to buy the next level of games
B005I4JG80|1.0|According to my wife, this book is the biggest rip-off she has ever experienced. She would rate it as No Stars if she had that option. It is bulked up with more than 25 pages of useless acknowledgements and additional index pages. She has read more interesting and longer articles in magazines. I wish she could get her money back. Shame on you!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I was a little on the fence about the game when I first started playing thinking oh no not another farmville but now I really find it enjoyable. you can hunt wild animals that come through your land and fish in the ponds. What I like the most is customizing my town. Only downside is the energy bar, once its out you're out of the game until it refils.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Maybe the app itself works fine, but two or three times a day I would get spam notifications to \\"claim your free iPad\\" even though the app wasn't running. After downloading Airpush Detector it showed me that Tubemate was the main perpetrator. Do NOT support this application, they use Airpush without telling anyone because if they did tell people, then no one would download this trash.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I bought this on my Kindle Fire and love it. Its very entertaining for kids of all ages. Even if your an adult you'll love thos app. The reason I gave it only four stars is because thay they have a few levels that you have to get the premium version. All and all though it is a wonderful game. It is sure to be fun for ages 3-99.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|I installed the free version of Rocket Music Player and I am very impressed so far. It has similar features to other MP3 players that I have tried but it just seems a little easier to use and even a bit more stable than most other players. The only problem that I encountered in the free version is that sometime it is playing one track and displaying the information for another track. I plan to contact the developer to give him a little more information on this problem so that he can work out a solution. Overall, it is a great player.<br /><br />I also bought the unlocker to open up some additional features but encountered a problem with the audio that caused me to uninstall the unlocker. Rather than giving a bad review to the unlocked version, I will just mention it here and contact the developer about a solution.
B0071WQ7WU|3.0|Bullies is not one of them.  The kids singing in the background reminded me of Alice Cooper's Schools Out.  What I missed with this CD is that I was waiting for a couple of toned down songs, but that never happened.  Shinedown does not have to make a CD that is over sung.  I love the song Amaryllis (good lyrics and playing). Then you get farther down the CD and you get a song with with use of the \\"F\\" word.  What was that about? It seemed so juvenile. Shinedown is usually good as a group because of what they bring to the table.....memorable lyrics, a lead singer that can draw his audience into a song, 4 guys who seem to mesh as a group musically and personally.  I just don't see it here.
B002AF4Y96|1.0|This is my favorite movie of all time, and I own the directors cut in every format. Today when I popped in the blu ray, I noticed the picture shaking up and down. It start before the actual movie does, during the Warner and regency intro's. Within 5 minutes I could feel it making me motion sick and had to turn it off. Looked online and found I am not the only one who has received blu ray versions that does this.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|This is pretty easy - this Opteka SteadyVid Pro does what you could pay over four times as much for (ala the Merlin). Holds the camera steady, pivots smoothly, and (maybe I'm a lucky one) is NOT the hardest thing to get the balance on. The build is quality - no breakable plastic here.<br /><br />If you change the camera body or lenses or add peripherals (i.e. from a 7D to 5D Mark III/24-105mm to 70-200mm/adding a mic on the hotshoe/video light/etc.) there can be more tuning of the system to get the balance just so but once you have it for whatever set up simply mark out the position of adjustment and note the proper weighting.<br /><br />And it's possible to go further when combining this Opteka and a Cowboy Studios shoulder mount (need to add/manufacture a pin/post which inserts into the hollow of the grip portion on the Opteka and mounts to the Cowboy plate) for hands-free operation to give the arm and shoulder a break from time to time.<br /><br />For less than a couple of Benjamins this is wayyyyy worth the coin for a handheld steadicam.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|I got it when it was the free game of the day and I personally would spend a millon dollars on it.it's. awesome.
B000A6T262|5.0|Bought this about 3 years ago through the video store I used to work at.  All 10 films together in one box set!!!  Only draw back is the individual dvd cases are the older bigger sized cases.  No biggee for me, they are actually sturdier cases.<br /><br />You get all 6 Shatner films and all 4 Patrick Stewart films.  Up until the 2010 revamp this was ALL of the films.  I love my set and proudly display it in my collection.  I have not really watched the films too much, so I can't testify to video quality.  Amazon seems to mainly contain good reviews so I am not worried.  Next vacation I should really tear into this set...  Anyway, all you need if you purchase this set is to buy the 2010 revamp and you are currently caught up on Star Trek movies.<br /><br />Star Trek is a science fiction series for the thinking man, one that tries to get science facts correct...mostly.<br /><br />There are newer releases of this series out now on DVD and BLU-RAY.  Both seem overpriced compared to what I bought my set for.  Check around, namely places like FYE, you may have some luck there.  I have seen some cool hard to find sets there, namely The Planet of The Apes series in the Caesar's ape head, still kicking myself for not buying that.<br /><br />Anyway, my ramble is over.  Great looking set, if you can find for a good price and you are still not on the BLU-RAY bandwagon yet buy this set.<br /><br />Now, engage!!!

B00785P2QC|5.0|I like it. was looking for a game like the sims&hellip;this works. I also like the fact that it gives you goals to do. you're free building but you also have to meet the challenges
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a very fun, exciting read!<br />  I don't know why it's considered a \\"young adult\\" book. I know plenty of adults who have read and enjoyed it. Probably cause the main character is 16.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't write many reviews but I had to add my voice.  I'm a big fan of anything by William Gibson or Neal Stephenson.  Hugh Howey is now on my \\"can't wait for the next book\\" author list.  The flow of his stories is flawless.  The characters are vivid and real.  I read the Wool series because of all the good reviews and then read every other thing that Hugh Howey has on Amazon.  Go ahead and buy the Omnibus edition of the Wool series.  You absolutely will want to read all the parts.<br /><br />I believe Wool will become a science fiction classic.  This is one I will buy as a paper book to have in my library in addition to my Kindle version.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|from a game you can play on a tablet (Kindle Fire, in my case)? It functions properly, control and menu layout is good, and it's a ton of entertainment.<br />This is how I award stars here: The range is 1 through 5, no zero, so 1-star must include the worst imaginable and 5-star must include perfection, if there is such. 20% or less gets 1-star; better than 20% up to 40%, 2-stars; et c. 80%+ gets 5-stars.<br />The other system that I considered was this: Absolutely horrible in every way, 1-star; up to 33%, 2-stars; 34 to 66%, 3-stars; 67% or better but not perfect, 4-stars; ideal in every way, 5-stars. The problem with this is, of course, there would be no 1-star or 5-star ratings.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I immediately got hooked on this game and I couldn't put it down. kindle froze once but after a reboot never had a problem after. well worth it.
0765322889|3.0|I'm not going to try to summarize this book. It's been done elsewhere enough times, and I admit I'm not brave enough to try to reinvent that wheel. I read this as part of a group/buddy read; a friend had sent me a copy, and I had heard it very, very highly recommended.<br /><br />It's something, all right.<br /><br />Something that usually makes a fantasy or historical novel a wall-banger for me is the use of \\"OK\\" or \\"okay\\". Misuse, I should say. Believe it or not, I can be very tolerant of a lot of nonsense in a book; I (probably) won't jump all over a writer because he used, say, the word \\"shrapnel\\" or \\"sideburns\\" or some other anachronism in a medieval fantasy novel. I'll flinch, but I'll live and let the book live, if the rest makes it worth forgiving. But \\"OK\\" is ... not ok. (I know, it's inconsistent. Sue me.) I believe I covered the whys and wherefores in a blog post an age or two ago; to recap, to me it demonstrates a signal lack of care about the language and where it comes from. I've permanently closed books because a medieval type said \\"ok\\".<br /><br />Steven Erikson uses \\"OK\\" in Gardens of the Moon.<br /><br />I was hanging by a thread with the book; others who had read it kept saying \\"Stick with it! Don't give up! It's worth it!\\" And my comment while in the midst of it was that I enjoyed it while I was actually reading it, but had to push myself to actually pick it up and open to my bookmark and delve back into it. I actually considered using the \\"OK\\" (there were several, actually) as my excuse to quit, but I gritted my teeth and decided that - just this once - I would overlook it as ... a translation quirk. Whatever the characters were saying in their native tongues was best translated as \\"OK\\". It's a flaw. But I have to admit, it's one of few real flaws I can think of.<br /><br />Which doesn't mean I loved this book, or the writing of it. Another note I made: \\"I've been reading through the Fantasy Book Club Series threads on Gardens of the Moon, and while I think it's wonderful that Erikson inspires so much fierce loyalty (which I've seen elsewhere too), I also find it deeply off-putting to read 'study the character lists! Read every word carefully! Study the poems and quotes at the beginnings of chapters! Pay attention to everything!' I do try to read with attention, but to me it's not a mark of a good writer that all useful understanding of a book hinges on a study of every damn word.\\"<br /><br />I also found it a bit startling how many people told me (when I was mired deep in the middle and a bit afraid that I'd never reach the end) \\"it will really grab you around page 350!\\" I can only, again, admire the ferocity of loyalty that can with a straight face say a book will begin to truly claim a reader's attention several pages after a huge percentage of books have concluded. Oddly, it was true. It took me days to get past one middle page (I remember it because it had a smudge on it), and from there to the end it seemed to take less than half the time to read, possibly because I was actually returning to the book more often and more willingly.<br /><br />Here's the thing. I can't appreciate a writer who does not feel the least inclination to make his book less than hard work for the reader. I don't appreciate a book which should come with its own Princeton Review study guide. I don't need my hand held through a book; I loathe infodump and I don't mind being dropped in media res; but there's a difference between avoiding infodump and ... just not bothering to explain anything. It is, apparently, a book which rewards rereading, which is never a bad thing in my world. However, I usually do prefer a book which makes the first read enjoyable too...<br /><br />Characters with several, occasionally rotating names I can deal with; I read history and historical novels too. Sorry and Lorn got nothin' on Francis Crawford of Lymond. But ... huge flying bug-steeds? Warrens? Blue people? Seriously - warrens? Acorns? Flying monkeys?? Death is negotiable; life is often pretty worthless; loyalty is never to be counted on ...<br /><br />I don't appreciate a book, or rather a writer, almost intentionally setting out to allow me to feel stupid. I believe Jonathan Franzen is the source for the quote \\"The reader is a friend, not an adversary, not a spectator\\". It's something I'd like set out in nice large calligraphy and sent, framed, to Steven Erikson. By the end of Gardens of the Moon I did not feel like a spectator - I was more involved than that. I'd worked harder than that. I'd been dragged all over the planet, up hill and down barrow and through Warren. But I certainly did not feel like the author's friend, or the book's; of the three options in the quote for adjectives, I'll plump for \\"adversarial\\". I fought my way through the book. We reached a d&eacute;tente somewhere in the 300's, and an uneasy peace by the end. This peace was threatened by the introduction of a (to me, maybe not paying enough attention) huge foe somewhere around page 600; I was so glazed over by then, though, that I just went with it.<br /><br />Was it all worth it? I... think so. I can't commit myself more strongly than that. It was, once I found it, a compelling story. There were some characters that I came to truly enjoy - or loathe, in a good way - and want more of. I've compared writing to juggling spaghetti - loose strands flopping all over the place and tangling and getting where they shouldn't, and altogether almost impossible to contain; I think reading Gardens of the Moon was also a bit like juggling spaghetti. I'm not encouraged by reading comments here and there about how subsequent books in the series are harder to get into.keys??

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Proof positive that it is a far better idea to consult a single trusted friend than the NYT best seller list when it comes to selecting your next read. This is literally the worst written book I have ever endeavored to read.  And, that is coming from a woman who admittedly and ashamedly finished the twilight series in under 7 days.  Granted, Stephanie Meyer is no Jane Austen, but at least she tried harder than \\"Holy crap! he's so freaking hot!\\". I'm sorry, but having been exposed to good erotica,  \\"Aargh! I moan as my body bows and convulses at the touch of his tongue\\" does nothing except make me laugh at the way that Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" responds to Christian Grey's oral skills, but maybe that's because \\"aargh\\" is not a sound I have ever made while doing anything remotely sexy and I find women who reference their \\"inner goddess\\" equally laughable. Sadly, the examples are endless. I seriously wonder if this author has ever had sex. She created a heroine who is an English major yet refers to her vagina as \\"down there\\" and/or as her \\"sex\\". Seriously.

0553251023|4.0|Poor \\"little Albert\\", dragged in kicking (literally) and screaming (or at least complaining loudly) to assist the remarkable newly Superintendent Charlie Luke in the investigation of a number of killings. He only wanted to go on vacation - and shortly found himself left unsure whether he was more likely to be kidnapped by the bad guys or the good guys. The plot was handled nicely; since the reader pretty much knows the villain is the villain it's more a matter of suspense - is he going to hurt the old lady or the girl, or the girl's beau? How are Campion and co. going to find him? Not \\"whether\\", of course. And what exactly is he up to? Allingham's greatest gift was with rounded, real, believable characters, which is why her books are so enjoyable to go back to again. I liked this one a lot.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|When was the last time I went to see a film twice in the theater?  Well, there were Hobbits in it.  I've seen John Carter three times in as many weeks.  When was the last time I HAD to place a pre-order to get the DVD ASAP?  Never!!!  I could always wait, even for LOTR.  So why is this film different?<br /><br />John Carter has a lot going for it, despite anything the critics may have said.  I am not a prior fan of the actors or director, so that isn't why I went.  I just loved the books.  I was fortunate not to read the bad press until after I bought a ticket and so I went expecting an acceptable adaptation, maybe what we think of as \\"the Disney Version.\\"  What I got was so much more.  Two heroes you can empathize with and respect - John and Tars Tarkas - who change and grow while you watch them.  There is a princess who could give lessons in spunk, brains and sheer grrrl power to any female around and still be your BF, and the cutest - and fastest - monster-dog you've ever seen.<br /><br />This is not cheesy CGI - these characters are well done, well rounded and believable. I forgot they were animated.  There is no gratuitous throwing junk at the screen, no camera jiggle to hide the poor SFX.  Just sheer talent displayed by the entire cast - live and animated.<br /><br />If you liked 20000K Under the Sea - you will like this movie. It is epic!<br />If you liked StarWars - you will like this movie - the princess is priceless.<br />If you liked LOTR - you will get a kick out of the Tharks and love Woola.<br />If you liked Romeo & Juliet - this love story will also move you.<br />If you just want a few good laughs John Carter has those too.<br /><br />See it before it is gone and/or grab it on DVD while you can.<br />Tarks Takas says four thumbs way UP, and I have to agree with him!

1416583432|4.0|Alexandra Horowitz racked up major brownie points right from the beginning with this book. The title comes from one of my favorite quotes ever, from the mouth of Groucho Marx. Also, early on she heads complaints off at the pass by stating that she is using \\"owner\\" rather than \\"pet parent\\" or some other such silly phrasing because that's the legal term, and she will use \\"him\\" and \\"his\\" when referring to dogs in general because that's the English default, and, knowing dogs as she does, \\"it\\" is not an option. That latter scored high with me: I have Issues with writers who use \\"it\\" for animals (particularly those who talk about a mare or stallion and then call the horse \\"it\\"), so this made me happy. She is a long-time dog person, so all else being equal we are kindred spirits.<br /><br />And it is a fascinating look at canine life and behavior. I'm not sure it made me see my dog in a whole new light as she promised it would, except for a qualm every time I scratch her back that I might be asserting my dominance - but she loves every second of it, so if I am dominating her she's ok with it. I pretty much knew about the dominance of scent in a dog's life; I did not know about the way a dog perceives color (they're not colorblind, exactly). I knew a little about signs of dominance and submission; I didn't know about what face-licking might really mean. (Pop goes the illusion...ew.) I like the insight that the pitch of a voice, canine or human, in many ways equates to size: low and menacing indicates not only a warning but the idea \\"and I'm big enough to follow through, too.\\"<br /><br />Something I sort of knew but found confirmation for: wolves howl when they're lonely. So, I can attest, do beagles. Only moreso.<br /><br />One valuable thing this book does is reiterate the common-sense yet somehow easily overlooked point that, just as we don't know why our dogs do some of the things they do, most of what we the people do (much less say) is utterly incomprehensible to dogs. That, very simply, they don't think the way we do. It's all very well for us to say \\"don't get up on the couch, no, bad!\\" - but there's a very simple reason it's so hard to enforce. To a dog the couch is not an expensive piece of furniture which needs to be protected from shed fur and stains - it's a nice soft elevated surface to curl up on, with a nice back to it to curl up against, and after all that's what the bipeds use it for. And how can you honestly expect a dog to ignore that pail of food scraps and wrappers under the sink when it's just sitting there at her level smelling (to her) so wonderful? Again, \\"no, bad!\\" doesn't really make sense to a dog, however often and however loudly it's repeated. It's food. It's there. It's unprotected. It's hers. Dogs don't naturally do many of the things we ask them to do; many owners, and even many trainers seem to either forget that they're not mute people but canines, and this is where dressed-up dogs doing ridiculous things on command come from. Poor things.<br /><br />This book made me happy I never successfully trained any of our dogs to heel (not that I tried too strenuously).<br /><br />I was simultaneously impressed with and bemused by the tales of the research studies that have been conducted on dogs; on the one hand, some of the results are fascinating - where dogs' mental processes may (or may not) function like toddlers'; on the other, I found myself marveling that well-educated grownups spend their days fooling around with dogs, all in the name of science. Some of them wore buckets on their heads.<br /><br />Overall, this book did an admirable job of both teaching me what an umwelt is and helping me deepen my understanding of a dog's. This was a comprehensible, mostly-plain-language, often very funny and occasionally moving study which both solidified and informed my stance as a fiercely partisan dog person. While it's not intended as a training guide, there's some wonderfully common sense information, particularly toward the end, which will be valuable both with Daisy and when - hopefully years from now - I next need it. Did it change the way I see my beagle? Not much. But I do feel like I have a better handle on what's going on between those long ears. I have an even deeper appreciation for that always-busy nose.<br /><br />And I'm kind of glad she's never been much of a face-licker.ularly toward the end, which will be valuable both with Daisy and when - hopefully years from now - I next need it.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I wasn't sure about reading this book, due to the violence between teens. It was very hard in the first book, I did put it down about half-way through until I could regain my composure. I picked it up again after a couple of days, because I wanted to see how the author handled these death games. The subject was a little reminiscent of George Orwell's 1984- a very scarey book to me as a teen in 1970 that the government could have so much power over the individual. Each Hunger Games book had many casualties in the story; I was impressed that the deaths were not detailed & bloody, considering that in our world, movies, television & video games are all graphically violent. I think the writer did a wonderful job, weaving the uncertainty of newly emerging teen emotions in Katniss around two young men's devotion to her, without sexual intimacy. Add to that the emotional pressure of staying alive in wartime. This story is not an impossibility, and I liked that a revolution against an oppressive government results against the cruelty of these games; an old story from history. It's not so far removed from the Roman's entertainment of feeding the Christians to the lions and the slaughter of Jewish people-including children- by Hitler.<br />I agree with one reviewer- watch the movie before you read the book- simply because the book, in my experience, is always better!
