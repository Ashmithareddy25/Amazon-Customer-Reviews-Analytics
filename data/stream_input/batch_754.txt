1591841666|3.0|I love that \\"The Dip\\" is such a short book, weighing in at around 100 pages with little text on each page. The author manages well to get his point across, and the ideas presented in the book are very sticky. The ideas in the book are bound to stay with you for a long time.<br /><br />The book would have benefited from some structure though. The short sections are not intertwined in any obvious way; the book is more like a random patchwork of the same concept illuminated from different angles.
B000J234R0|5.0|U2 really hit it big in 1987 with 'The Joshua Tree.' That was followed up in 1988 with the concert film 'Rattle & Hum.' The soundtrack to the legendary film still remains one of my favorites.    However, in 1991, the group made what I like to call the \\"follow up\\" to 'The Joshua Tree,' 'Achtung Baby.' 'Achtung' is an excellent CD. I sometimes consider it a compilation of U2. I mean, so many essential songs are here on this one CD. 'Zoo Station,' 'The Fly,' 'Mysterious Ways,' 'Ultraviolet,' 'Love Is Blindness,' and of course 'Even Better Than The Real Thing.'    Sure, many people think that 'The Joshua Tree' is better, but to me, this is in my top 3 or 4 favorite U2 records. But, than again, so is 'The Joshua Tree.'    If you don't already own 'Achtung,' definitely check it out. It's among U2's best records, and it's one of the smartest purchases you may ever make. It's an excellent addition to anybody's CD collection.    Highly, highly recommended. ENJOY!!!
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Alright. I love Stargate, and I can't wait for this DVD, but you people are all just ranting about how much you loved the series... The point of this review system is to talk about the DVD isn't it? I really I am being a hypocrite, but I just had to say something, and I definitely intend to share a real review once I've actually SEEN it.
B00000612Q|4.0|Practically any album Rod Stewart worked on from the late 1960s to the middle 1970s is worth listening to, and some are worth their weight in gold. This is one of them. There are great original songs here, including \\"Wear it Well\\" (which everyone seems to remember) and \\"True Blue\\" (which everyone seems to have forgotten). There are also great covers of Dylan, Cooke, and Hendrix songs. All songs are recorded in that inimitable early 1970s Rod Stewart style - lots of mandolin, acoustic guitar, slide, and slightly fuzzy leads courtesy of Ron Wood. The album has a cohesive sound, as well as a downtempo mood. I don't know how Rod Stewart captured the feel of a down-on-his luck working-class man living a far from fabulous life - but he did, and this CD is proof that Rod Stewart can tell wonderful, humanistic stories. The only song on this CD that I don't like is \\"Italian Girls\\" which reminds me of a mediocre Faces track. It's the only wasted moment on a CD that has no dull moments.    Rod Stewart's extreme late 1970s success means that he'll never be overplayed on classic rock radio the way bands like the Who and the Stones are. I'm sure there are plenty of tracks here that you've never heard. Buy this CD and make some memories for yourself.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow turned out to be a midget; all the while I thought it was the title for the character performed by Val Kilmer.  Of course Val still got top billing, but the real star of the film is Warwick Davis, the under four feet midget.  If I'm not mistaken he was only eighteen when he made the film.  He, however, played a father of two young children quite convincingly.  Kilmer, nevertheless, got a beefy part with lots of actions that need agility and he is superb in it.  I don't need to say a lot I need only to sum up that all the actors are very good in their parts, even the two child midget stars are very good and cute with their perfomances.  the special effects are simply fantastic and there are lots of them.  All in all this is a very good film you don't want to miss no matter what age you are.  Thanks to Ron Howard's able dirction.  the special features are also interesting especially 'the making of an adventure' segment is very informative.
B000WC39ZY|5.0|If you look up this film on Wikipedia you find it is on several \\"100 Greatest Films\\" lists by several groups including Time magazine and various film groups.  It is a tribute to all the great Hollywood musicals and noir films of the 1940s and 1950s and as Sorcese explains in the commentary everything is a little brighter, cleaner, neater than real life, to capture that sound stage feel of the studio era.      De Niro plays a tough new Yorker whose main love is Be Bop, a pure musical jazz form with little commercial appeal but he cares for the music and an appreciative audience more than money.  Minelli plays a singer of mainstream Broadway style hits of the 1950s with great commercial and audience appeal.  Both excel at their art form but it takes them down different roads and as much as De Niro's character loves Minelli's he loves his art more than her, and in the end it looks like she feels the same.    The movie opens with \\"Sing, Sing, Sing\\", the quintessential swing era hit, and moves through the music of the era to the fifties.  The music is terrific, and the move treats it like one of the principal actors, letting the other actors and the audience pause and take note while the music takes center stage, which it often does.  All the production values are terrific, including the clothing, and the sets.    Highly recommended.
0312330529|5.0|A novel full of beauty and pain. You fall in love with the story the first word and through the good times and bad are entranced by its characters, philosophy, and vivid descriptions of the locations.  A must read story.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|This DVD is absolutely superb. Not only for the performances of Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Three (+Statler Bros) and the Carter Family, but for all the other great artist guests from 1969-1970. James Taylor, Eric Clapton, Carl Perkins, Charlie Pride, Loretta Lynn, Tammie Wynette, Louie Armstrong, Stevie Wonder, Jerry Lee Lewis, just to name a few of the guest artists from many different musical genres. Johnny is introduced by his good friend Kris Kristofferson (who is shown performing in his young days), and Marshall, one of his original trio members. It is wonderful to see these performers in their prime. Absolutely top-notch. You will not regret buying this DVD.
B000YXMMAE|2.0|Long time fan, not understanding the enthusiasm for this CD.  It's rather mediocre.  A few really sweet songs, ie the slow ones, but the rest sounds like leftovers laying on the floor that were thrown on.  Sort of undone songs.  In speaking with a few people they tend to agree it's just alright.  If you are a new fan don't start here.  Try The Bends or OK Computer.  Both are classics unto themselves.  To hear someone say In Rainbows ranks up there with OK Computer is blasphemy.
B000002UZU|4.0|This is a great set, a raw & spontaneous jam session (what else would you expect from these guys?) with a production quality that almost sounds like it was recorded just yesterday. The first CD mostly features JLH alone-- stompin' & cookin' up the sparse & emotional groove that is uniquely his. The second CD features more of Canned Heat with some excellent guitar & harp work by the band. The last cut, Boogie Chillen #2, is worth the purchase alone, especially if you're a harmonica fan.
6304806434|5.0|Yes, the movie is implausible and most of the actors are obviously laughing on the inside over their dialogue and motivations, but it's a big-budget action flick, so that's what makes it fun. It has some of the most quotable dialogue in recent memory and it's one of those movies you can watch over and over again just for kicks. Besides, who can resist a movie that has a minor plot point involving a stuffed bunny?
0061142026|3.0|In old English times, young Tristan has fallen in love with the most beautiful girl in the village of Wall. She does promised him a kiss if he retrieved a fallen star, so he goes off searching for it.<br /><br />A quick read, written like the old fairy tales with flowery language. It reads as if it was written in the time that it takes place. It has the fantasy twist where beyond the Wall is a whole different world that most people in the village are not allowed to travel, but Tristan is able. He goes off having adventures, searching and finding the star, trying to get her back to Wall when she doesn't want to go with him and is angry that she fell in the first place.<br /><br />I enjoyed the star's spunk and unwillingness to cooperate with the young man trying to kidnap her, even though he didn't see it that way. He viewed her as an object and finally sees her as more than that, even though she isn't human, she still has feelings. Tristan was still likeable, even when he was so bull-headed and clueless that the girl he loved back home could care less about him. He grows up on his adventures, even though the entire book zips along really quickly.<br /><br />I would have liked if some parts were expanded upon more. I felt like parts of it were getting interesting and then it moved onto the next part. It wasn't a sudden jerk to a new topic, but the event would be wrapped up quickly or summarizes instead of told. Beyond that, it was a nice, sweet book.
B000YA82F6|5.0|This is one interesting ride through coolism. Juno, the main character of the movie, shows she has the maturity of a 40 year old, yet is quirky and pretentious enough to be a teenager. The movie is also chocked full of edgy, too cool for school adult situations: adultery, abortion, divorce, it's all there. I can't believe the cool police let me watch the entire movie. This movie is too cool for most people, probably you too.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|Excellent remastering of a classic film. The extra addition to the DVD provide a keen indepth look on how the film was made. I recommend this purchase to anyone with a keen eye to epic films. This is a MUST in a collectors library.[[ASIN:B000WMFZNS El Cid (Two-Disc Limited Collector's Edition)]]
0385512058|3.0|The book starts off great by cogently convicing the reader that business is primarily about relationships. It is teamwork, not individualistic achievements, which creates and enables great things. Here is an exerpt from the first chapter:<br /><br />\\"I came to realize that first semester at business school that Harvard's hypercompetitive, individualistic students had it all wrong. Success in any field, but especially in business, is about working with people, not against them. No tabulation of dollars and cents can account for one immutable fact: Business is a human enterprise, driven and determined by people.\\"<br /><br />OK great start.<br /><br />The author, unfortunately, never stops talking about himself, his personal achievements, and his company. I would say approximately 25%-30% of the book is dedicated to the author, his life, and his company. At the end of the book, a reader could put together his resume. This would make some sense if the author was a well known public figure. But he isn't.<br /><br />The author provides some good examples and knowhow on how to focus on the most important thing in business. His methods of networking and connecting with people seems to be have some validity. I think the author's emphasis on relationships and its importance, which is often neglected in business education, is probably enough to justify paying and reading this book. Too bad it could have been far better than an unwanted autobiography in disguise.
B000P0J09W|4.0|As a child, I remember being the first in our community to see this movie.  I loved it then, and I love it still.  My boys are of the same mind as I am.  They really liked it too.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|I'm usually uncomfortable about anybody singing Beatles songs.  I grew up with the Beatles so, of course, I had to see this movie.  One thing I have basically confirmed again to myself about this movie, is that John Lennon and Paul McCartney were fabulous songwriters.  Some songs here were sang slower that the original Beatle versions so it's easy to cherish every written word of the songs while hearing them with a mildly darker, grungier, intention.  Listen again to the words of \\"I've Just Seen a Face.\\"  What an excellent song!  Nobody writes songs like this anymore.  No wonder everybody continues to love the Beatles.<br /><br />You know, if you liked this film, then check out 1978's \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\"  which starred Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees, plus an all-star cast.  It's basically the same intention that you're seeing with \\"Across the Universe\\".  In \\"Sgt Pepper...\\" you'll get a series of go-nowhere events that allows the stars of the film to break out into a Beatles song.  Plus, in \\"Sgt. Pepper...\\" you'll get a variety of popular seventies artists singing Beatles songs.  Many which became hits.  Aerosmith did \\"Come Together\\", Alice Cooper did \\"Because\\", Steve Martin did \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\", Earth, Wind, and Fire did \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\", and Robin Gibb did \\"Oh Darling\\".  Plus lots of other songs by various artists.<br /><br />Though the film \\"Sgt. Pepper...\\" was considered silly at the time, all you \\"Across the Universe\\" fans just might think that it's one to cherish as well.  At least, rent it and check it out.
0321525655|5.0|go thro' this book once more,   go thro' your story, and  go thro' your slides.    You'd find that the PZ approach evangelized by Garr cuts thro' all the non-essentials and then, lets you present your beautiful story as you know it to the audience. I agree with 'Even Teachers Present' comment that the way you present the content/story matters more than the content itself. As a lecturer myself, my single most important aim in classroom is to make my students understand my lectures. I do receive a lot of ready-made powerpoint/pdf slides from book publishers, however I always design my own slides. That idea came when I started following Garr's fantastic Presentation Zen blog. Designing one's slides/presentation would be synonymous to taking l'il journeys into yourself, bring out those rich experiences and merge them with the present to create a beautiful presentation your audience would certainly appreciate. And the PZ approach shows you the tools to do just that.  What I really like about the PZ book is that I have the presentation wisdoms in my hand and I can make mini notes in the book. Though.. I wouldn't recommend anyone to be too carnal to this beautiful book ;-). Yes, it's that good!   No, no second thoughts. Go buy it!=)
B0000DC14V|4.0|I first saw this movie back in the early sixties and I still wonder why it was named \\"one eyed jacks\\"! There's no cards played in the whole movie! Other than that, it was still good and entertaining as it was back then. It was sort of the height of the western movie before Clint Eastwood and the like came on the scene, and when the drive-in's were the best family outing for movies.
0618918248|5.0|I probably have nothing original to add to the immense amount of praise for this brilliant book, but knowing that cultural change only comes about when enough people are willing to take a stand on an issue of such magnitude, I wanted to add my vote to the side of reason.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This might be my favorite movie.  Usually I don't like movies with an ensemble cast because there is too much to take in and I get confused.  But this movie is not like that.  It is beautiful, happy, sad, and as realistic as you can make a story about actual love without being depressing.  Each time I watch it I have a different favorite story line.  I also own the soundtrack. And it's not just a chic-flick.  They guys can relate too.
B000WZAE1I|3.0|ONCE UPON A TIME, there was a movie called Stardust based on Master Gaiman's popular work.  And so it was that the film came to pass, and it attempted to stay true to its roots, and in doing so was actually three tales combined.<br /><br />THE FIRST TALE was about a randy young man named Dunstan Thorn (Nathaniel Parker) who escaped the town of Wall, which also happened to have a wall, and was thus the reason for its namesake.  On the other side of the wall (or Wall, if you prefer) was a kingdom known as Stormhold.  The very first person that Dunstan met there was a princess, who was captured by a witch. Having discovered that she was held captive, good Dunstan promptly did what any good adventurer would do; that is, to sully her virtue and not call her for nine months.  Thus it was that a bundle of joy named Tristan (Charlie Cox) arrived at his doorstep.<br /><br />But Tristan was as unwise in choosing love as his father was lax in returning for his lady friend, which, by all accounts, means the adventuresome Dunstan left the princess to languish for something in the order of twenty plus years. Anyway, Tristan promised to win the beautiful but decidedly unpleasant Victoria's (Sienna Miller) hand in marriage by retrieving a fallen star.  Except said star turned out to be quite the hottie herself (Yvaine played by Claire Danes) rather than a glowing piece of plasma, which complicated matters as you can probably imagine.<br /><br />THE SECOND TALE was about a ruthless king (Peter O'Toole) and his backstabbing seven sons.  These seven were all as ruthless as their father, and when the king fell ill they merrily offed each other in devious ways, until only one was left.  But alas, the princes all were cursed to roam the earth as ghosts, and really had nothing else to do but comment on the events happening in the movie, as if the audience needed to be told when there were funny bits. The inclusion of these princes was largely superfluous, as those who have read fairy tales, and those who have had fairy tales read to them, most certainly knew who would end up with the crown in the end.<br /><br />It just so happened that any prince-who-would-be-king required an amulet, which was tied to a star.  And that the king, on his deathbed, sent the amulet into space, which turned the star into a woman, and then brought her back down to earth, which led to quite a few jokes about being a star.  All that glowing and such.<br /><br />THE THIRD TALE was about witches and pirates, an unbeatable combination when the primary witch, Lamia, was played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the primary pirate, Captain Shakespeare, was played by Robert DeNiro.  And yet it was odd in that Lamia, who became uglier and weaker with every spell she cast, cast an awful lot of them, often with wild abandon.  And it was also odd that Captain Shakespeare, a flaming fey pirate if there ever was one, was also an awful combatant, as evidenced by his sound trouncing by one of the many princes in pursuit of the star.  And it was most certainly odd that a talented actor like DeNiro would play a gay pirate so outlandishly foppish, complete with a lisp, that it should devolve into offensive parody instead of humor.  But that's pirates for you.<br /><br />And so it came to pass that Stardust, which ran far too long, was the rare film with more budget than it knew what to do with.  And thus the special effects were amazing, the acting pretty good, the plot not so much, and the conclusion, while thrilling, a little trite.  So the adventurous critic, only somewhat amused by Stardust, watched Princess Bride instead, which while not having nearly as much of a special effects budget, had twice the charm.<br /><br />And he lived happily ever after.d fairy tales read to them, most certainly knew who would end up with the crown in the end.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|FORBIDDEN PLANET is an adaptation of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST that blends classic Freudian themes with innovative sci-fi concepts.  The movie has a great cast with Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis and of course Robby the Robot.  As a sci-fi fan I enjoyed the attention to detail that George Lucas seems to have forgotten.  Notice that the flying saucer doesn't make any noise as there is no sound in space. I also enjoyed the groundbreaking electronic music used in the score of the film. The effects used in the movie were cutting edge at the time and still hold up fifty years later.  And as for this two disc set it has lots of cool special features including a feature length film THE INVISIBLE BOY and a short TV episode both of which star the iconic robot Robby. This classic movie influenced many future sci-fi films and is essential viewing for any fan of the genre.
B0001RVQM8|5.0|Jonathan Biss is rapidly becoming known as one of our more important young pianists on the concert stage today.  His technique is dazzling, his involvement with the works he elects to perform is respectful of the composers' markings and relates to the spirit of the music from the period of the time of composition, and he manages to draw his audiences into the music with his straightforward 'music first' approach. He is very much on the ascent and EMI Classics is to be commended for allowing his recording introduction in 2004 with this VERY affordable CD of works by Beethoven and Schumann.  Yes, he has grown in depth and finesse since this four-year old recording as we would expect from a serious artist of his young years, but this CD is still a superb recital.<br /><br />Opening with Beethoven's 'Fantasy in G minor', Biss immediately demonstrates his mastery of technique as well as his beautifully managed phrasing.  Following is Schumann's 'Davidsb&uuml;ndlert&auml;nze' in as satisfying a performance as is available from the recordings of the older masters. The recital  closes with Beethoven's 'Appassionata Sonata in F minor' and it is here that the combination of technique and musicality are best wedded.  Biss is an intelligent, articulate and communicative pianist as his subsequent recordings and performances have proved. This CD may have been a 'beginning' but it is one that belongs in the libraries of all lovers of superb piano performances. Grady Harp, February 08

I just bought this movie because it was on sale and am very happy I did. I read the reviews on several websites and took the plunge to order it was wowed. The special effects are great, and I learned a lot about the series' history which got me into the Firefly series. So if you like some sci-fi and you like westerns or just some great humor mixed with exciting action and great story telling you will definitely enjoy this movie.
0060833459|5.0|In the spring of 1980, I spent a full day with Peter Drucker.  He then made a full-day presentation at the University of  Southern California in Los Angeles.  I made sure to arrive early  so I could sit front row, center.  I spent a stimulating day  listening and watching as \\"the master\\" spoke on the subject of  managerial effectiveness.    Drucker, a true renaissance man, supported his points with   examples from the worlds of business, government, sports, music   and war.    In \\"The Effective Executive,\\" Drucker likewise draws on his broad  knowledge.  He writes that, to be effective, an executive (whom he   defines as any knowledge worker responsible for making decisions) must master five specific skills...    -- Managing time  -- Choosing what to contribute  -- Mobilizing strength  -- Setting the right priorities  -- Making the right decisions    About managing time, Drucker offers that the effective executive  eliminates time-wasting activities and consolidates time spent on  important projects.    On choosing what to contribute to the organization, he tells that  the effective executive asks \\"What can I contribute to  significantly affect the performance and results of this  organization\\"?  And he stays focused on results rather than on  efforts.    Regarding the subject of mobilizing strength, Drucker councils  executives to hire and manage people with an emphasis on their  strengths rather than concern about their weaknesses.  And  he advises executives to discover and mobilize their own  individual working style.    About setting the right priorities, he offers two important  thoughts.  First, \\"It is more important to convert an opportunity  into results than to solve a problem -- which only restores the  equilibrium of yesterday.\\"  And second, \\"Concentration -- that is,   the courage to impose on time and events his own decision as to   what really matters and comes first -- is the executive´s only  hope of becoming the master of time and events instead of their  whipping boy.\\"    On making decisions, he advises stimulating disagreement among the   management team.  For disagreement brings consideration of alternatives, in turn, brings understanding.  He also reminds us that a decision isn't complete until it becomes a detailed work assignment.  Until then, it is merely a good intention.    As with each of Drucker´s books, \\"The Effective Executive\\" is  loaded with quotable \\"Druckerisms.\\"  For example...    -- \\"The truly important events on the outside are not the trends.    They are changes in the trends.\\"    -- \\"He [the effective executive] always assumes that the event  that clamors for his attention is in reality a symptom.  He looks  for the true problem.  He is not content with doctoring the  symptom alone.\\"    -- \\"One of the most obvious facts of social and political life is  the longevity of the temporary.\\"    Upon finishing writing my own book, \\"Strategic Thinking: A Four  Piece Puzzle,\\" I wrote to Peter Drucker asking if he´d write an  endorsement for the book.  Sure, I knew it was a long shot, but  what could I lose except a postage stamp?    Sure enough, he turned me down.  He mailed back my letter on  which he had scrawled four words, \\"I don´t do that.\\"      I´ve kept that letter.  For two reasons... Not only is it the shortest rejection letter I´ve ever received, but, more importantly, it´s a personal note from the master himself -- Peter Drucker.
B000XA5K48|5.0|I recently watched this movie and I loved it. Its like the makers of the film were watching action movies and came up with ideas that would be awesome to watch. Well done. This movie features some of the most insane, over the top, you cannot believe that just happened moments in any action movie ive seen in a very long time. This movie is probably the best action movie in the last 15 years. I highly recommend this movie if your not looking for an oscar worthy movie and just want to be entertained.
B00005JPKE|3.0|We very rarely see a movie that portrays what goes on behind enemy lines. To us, Japan was the enemy, and to Japan, vice versa, so it was sort of interesting to watch the happenings on the other side of things. That said, the movie itself is somewhat on the bland side, especially the first half. Truly not much happened, it was all just a waiting game. When the battles actually begin, it is very intense and graphic. Especially the suicide scenes. Very poignant and true. The acting was very solid throughout. The only gripe I have is with the subtitles. They were somewhat hard to read in certain scenes. Either they were not on the screen long enough, or they were just hard to make out in contrast with the scene background. I do not mind reading subtitles, I just wish they stood out a little better in this film. I don't know how much of this film is historically accurate, but that is difficult to achieve with any war film. But this one is certainly worth watching.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Typical horror movies seek to use startle horror or just throw intense amounts of gore to scare.     Saw has some of both but by far blows away any other attempts to categorize this film. Unique movies are becoming very difficult to find but this movie will leave you wanting more and with a pleasantly disturbing feeling in the pit of your stomach that I haven't felt since such awesome films as Seven and Frailty.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie was everthing I'd been told.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and especially hearing Peter O'Toole as the food critic. He did an excellent job. A very fun movie to watch.
B0000640SA|4.0|Guy Pearce is a man who can make no new memories beyond the short term, so how does one find your wifes killer under such circumstances?    Filmed in snapshots and in a strange order you really have to watch this movie several times to really feel the full effect but it is worth every minute of disjointed suspense.    Guy Pearce and Carrie Ann-Moss really shine and deliver top notch performances.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is the best series on WWII and finally it's out in DVD. Narrated by Olivier, so it has that super dramatic feeling. Filmed in the 70's, it is your last chance to see interviews with survivors who are now dead. Very strong in all battlefronts and segments. (Stalingrad is just horrific!)

Many times I find myself consulting it for the proper placement of commas and such. I'll pick it up from time to time and read a few pages just to keep myself sharp. How many times I have out to use something I read in passing.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. Live it.
B000FGGE7C|2.0|My comments only concern the DVD versus Blu-ray issue.      I have the unrated extended cut of the DVD version and the PG-13 theatrical cut of the Blu-ray version.  My experience has been that DVDs mastered in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version (either on a Blu-Ray player or an upconvert DVD player).  Ultraviolet is no exception.  Moreover, the look of the film seems to soften details, which really defeats the point of Blu-ray.    Aside from no improvement in the look, the Blu-ray version has no more special features than the DVD, and the extended cut DVD has seven additional minutes.  Go with the DVD version on this one.

My experience has been that DVDs mastered in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version (either on a Blu-Ray player or an upconvert DVD player).  Underworld is no exception.  This was my first Blu-ray movie and I put both versions in at the same time (Blu-ray and an upconvert player for the DVD) and kept flipping back and forth between the inputs.  I couldn't tell the difference.  Both had great detail.    The unrated Blu-ray version had a few extra scenes that helped to explain why the blond vampire helped Selene at one point, but it wasn't critical.  Both versions have good special features.  They seem nearly identical, but the Blu-ray version might have one or two small additions.    If you have a DVD version you probably need not buy the Blu-ray version.  If you are buying for the first time, the DVD version will be less expensive, but Blu-ray discs are supposed to resist wear better.  Your call.
B000GSQTFG|4.0|The 1983 edition was the update to the original primer on French cooking by Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle. It was the first book on doing French cooking using technology, new methods for old recipes - using a food processor, pre-sifted flour, different melting for chocolate that had changed characteristics, and so on. Not only is this a classic, but it is still usable!

B0012HCASA|3.0|I want to review both of these items because this is my first experience with both of these items.    Thanks to the Instapundit, I had the opportunity to download Amazon Unbox and downloaded my first episode of the Terminator chronicles.    I am using Windows XP with 512 megs of RAM and 1.1 Ghz Pentium 4 processor and a 40 gig HD. I downloaded Amazon Unbox without any problems.  It installed without any problems and I was able to download The Terminator chronicles without any problems.  Let me say that without high speed Internet (either DSL, cable or Fiber) it would not be possible.    My congratulations to people that designed the software for Unbox.  The install process was lengthy but it was successful.  There are no major problems as of yet.  Though I don't know what kind of data the software is sending to Amazon.      Now as to the Terminator chronicles.  It is better than the movie.  Plot and character development are much better.  Mother and son are very well done.  They both work well together.  But it needs some work.  The son has to grow up and become an adult, he just sounds petulant for now.  Hopefully that will change.      All in all a very good experience because there is an element of realism about it.
B000VI70WM|2.0|I can honestly say that I am not a diehard fan of Duran Duran. I have liked some of their songs from the 1980s but I just never bought into the hype over the band. Out of curiousity I decided to check out the band's new album RED CARPET MASSACRE. I went into the cd knowing full well that the band wasn't trying to recapture their glory days from the '80s so I wasn't massively let down like some people were. For the most part, I did like the album but there were a few tracks that were less than spectacular. I didn't care for the title track. Simon LeBon's vocals really got on my last nerves on that particular song. I really didn't need to hear Justin Timberlake on \\"Nite-Runner\\" who just really ruined the song for me with his vocals. I thought I was listening to a Duran Duran cd, not a Justin Timberlake cd. This is why I hate it when popular artist do collaborations with other popular artists, the other singer ruins the song (well, most of the time). I wasn't too keen on Timbaland on that same song either. Surprisingly enough I wasn't bothered by Timbaland's presence on \\"Skin Divers\\", one of my favorite tracks on the album. While the familiar synth beats are still there in the band's music, there definitely is a contemporary edge to the songs (hence the mediocre collaborations with Justin Timberlake and Timbaland). Most of the songs are as infectious as the band's '80s smash hits like \\"Hungry Like a Wolf\\" and \\"Rio\\". If the band in this current line up, puts out another cd, I sure hope they ditch the collaborations. They also need to go back to listen to their old stuff to know how to write some good tunes because the material on this album is pretty disposable and forgettable although I did like songs like \\"The Valley\\", \\"Box Full O'Honey\\" and \\"Skin Divers\\". Those songs are definitely not going to be classics like \\"Rio\\" and \\"Hungry Like a Wolf\\".

B000V8I2QU|4.0|As long as The Boss is alive, rock will never be dead. This album is really great. I agree that the arrangements are pretty overwhelming at times but if you pay attention to the lyrics, you'll find that this is truly a well-written, well-produced album that is one of the highpoints of rock music in this decade. I'm glad that it won two Grammys! It's worth listening if you love rock and want to hear something good.
0393317552|5.0|I am half way the book, but it gives me an unexpected overview of the history of homo sapiens since the latets ice-time.  Why went things as they went? Why conquered 168 Spaniards the Inca empire and dit not 168 inca's appear at Madrid and conquered the Spanish empire. What was the infuence of germs that were coupled to the domesticated animals?  And how futile - not in the book but my opnion - are the excuses made by some modern western governments of a course of history that nobody designed? What determined that course? Read this book!

B000OLNAX4|2.0|Mr. Stephen King may be a very nice man; he certainly loves his wife and his children, and as far as I can tell, is serious about what he calls \\"the craft\\" of writing. But he is not a very good writer. And it is strange to read a book by such a successful author, trying to explain the secret of his success, unfortunately, unsuccessfully.      Here I have to stipulate that I have never read any of Mr. King's books. I have seen a few of the films that were based on his early books: \\"Carrie,\\" of course, and \\"The Shining.\\" But since I am not reviewing any of his fiction, my criticism has to come from reading this non-fiction \\"how to\\" manual.    The book is roughly divided into three parts: the first section gives his c.v. (curriculum vitae) and life story. His account of his early childhood years, which may well have shaped his writing career, seems unnecessary in the context of the book. For one thing, there are an awful lot of holes in his autobiography, which is understandable if he had subconsciously tried to forget unhappy times, as he implies. But save for an incident with an ear infection, which is briefly referenced in the third section of the book, there's no compelling reason to read the biographical section at all.     Then we come to the largest portion of the book, the toolbox for author-wannabees like me. Mr. King advises on style and the structure of writing, but his advice isn't any different from my high school English teacher's bete noire, the over-use of the damnable passive voice. As for the small samples of his fiction included in the book (and I have to admit I could not always determine which were the \\"before\\" and which were the extreme makeover \\"after\\" passages), I didn't find his writing very impressive, just rather pedestrian, distinguished by his insistence that story drives the book. That would be fine is he wrote with flair, humor, or a compelling point of view; but the language he employs is not unique, nor especially riveting. His style ofediting out so-called \\"unnecessary words\\" strips the book of any literary or intellectual interest. I'll stick with the style of Charles Dickens, thank you, and pretend to be paid by the word, because I like using gazillions of words.    Beyond the nuts and bolts of putting words on a page, King offers some advice on the physical structure of your writing room, (which may have worked for him, although I don't think I would be very comfortable in a corner of the closet in my laundry room, lit by a single 40 watt incandescent bulb with a hungry grey mouse my only companion. OK, not literally, but you get my point). He mumbles something about where your desk should be placed, whether the door to your room should be open or shut, and how many pages (or words on a page) you should write a day. I think if I took his advice seriously, I would be so filled with self-doubt that I would have dissolved into a lump of melting Jello slithering gooilly over my laptop, afraid to put pen to paper (or finger to keyboard).     The third section of the book is the most moving, because it is not about hard-boiled science-fiction monster-horror novels; it is, in fact, an account of the horrifying 1999 car accident that interrupted the writing of this book, and nearly ended Mr. King's life. I recall reading others' accounts about how bad that accident was, but King's description of it, written with gallows humor, was harrowing and almost painful to read. But it was superbly crafted, and if Mr. King had written the rest of the book that well, I would have read it straight through.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|The songs are definitely in there but the production is so horrid you can't hear them,firstly it's mixed way too loud they have chosen to go with the wall of sound technique and Bruce's voice is lost in the mix every thing sounds flat there is no definition to the instruments and it starts to hurt to listen after about 4 songs,one of the best cds i have bought lately is Robert Plant and Alison Krauss have a listen to that for decent production.I hope they remaster this and let the great songs buried in here shine.
B000ZOXDFA|2.0|In the original Elizabeth we saw the title character transform from an inexperienced twenty-something into a queen by hardening her heart and learning the ways of cutthroat politics.  So, why in the sequel is she portrayed as a hysterical teenager?  The filmmakers didn't see fit to transfer any of what made the original character so great into the sequel.  Instead of the assured queen at the end of Elizabeth, in Elizabeth: The Golden Age we are treated to an insecure monarch reacting to a midlife crisis by acting half her age.    King Philip of Spain is amassing an armada to invade England.  He sees the Protestant queen as a spot of darkness in a Catholic world, even though, despite urgings to do so by her own counsel, she refuses to persecute Catholics in her own kingdom.  If this wasn't enough, her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, is planning to assassinate Queen Elizabeth and take the English throne.  In the midst of these political machinations is a love triangle between the explorer Walter Raleigh, Elizabeth, and one of Elizabeth's ladies in waiting.      For all of the intrigue and subplots, not much happens for the first half of the film and instead of political intrigue the audience is forced to endure another love scene where the two romantics ride horses in the countryside.  Raleigh and Elizabeth's relationship is utterly unconvincing.  I cannot understand how anyone but the most naïve would be taken in on Raleigh's \\"philosophical musings\\" about how when death closes in during a storm it only makes you want to live more, to which Elizabeth replies with wide eyes, \\"Yes, to live!\\"  It sounds like the kind of life philosophy that would fit nicely in between sketches of unicorns and rainbows.      The looming threat of the Inquisition accompanies the Spanish armada, even though we are never shown the religious intolerance of the Inquisition.  The menace would have loomed larger if the audience was aware of just exactly what was at stake.  The first film had the tremendous opening where Protestant heretics were burnt at the stake, would it have been too much for a similar reminder that Europe still had one foot in the Dark Ages?  Perhaps director Shekhar Kapur felt the dialogue was already enough torture for his audience.      In the film's defense, it does fulfill the historical film's need for extravagance in costume and cinematography.  However, looking pretty just isn't enough.  After the extraordinary introduction to Elizabeth in the first film the last thing an audience wants to watch is a digression.  If the film is about her rise to world dominance, then why does it feel as if Blanchett's playing the role of a washed up actress, past her prime and unable to get her agent on the phone?  It seems as if Elizabeth is more concerned with aging than she is with running her country.  The central metaphor to the film is that of a storm, which is uttered from the lips of many characters, and to be sure when you finish watching Elizabeth: The Golden Age, you'll feel as if you've weathered one yourself.
B00030EIY6|5.0|Everyone in the orchestra and the audience knew this would be the last time they would see Carlos Kleiber conduct this celebration.  There was an underlying sense of sadness during the performance as well as great joy.  Gerhard Hetzle (concertmaster) was terrific.  I prefer the '89 concert because I like the musical choices better and I think Kleiber was in better health but all in all, anytime you have a chance to hear and see Carlos Kleiber you should!  The orchestra plays superbly for him and, of course, his interpretations are squeaky clean.

B000006NXP|5.0|The world will continue to argue about who's recording of Brahms 4 is better - Kleiber or Karajan.  I'm afraid I can't chose one over the other.  The Berlin Philharmonic is so fantastic and Karajan's electronic facility is so 21st Century that his recording is overwhelmingly beautiful. Brahms played this romantically is very sexy and I think Berlin outplays Vienna.  BUT there is a passage near the end of the 4th movement of Kleiber's recording that really gives me pause.  He emphasises the rhythmic accents in only 3 chords and causes the music to run to the end of the symphony in a headlong rush of emotion.  Sorry, I still can't chose.  Buy this Kleiber recording, though.  You will not believe your ears.  Yes, he was a genius.

B00022XOAO|5.0|This is a recording of the one and only time Kleiber conducted this symphony.  Kleiber's son asked a friend to tape the performance on a little cassette recorder.  He also knew that every performance was recorded by the orchestra.  Well, the orchestra recording disintegrated in storage and if it weren't for the friend's cassette we would never hear this absolutely spectacular performance.  A brilliant engineer cleaned up the sound and although a bit below modern standards one doesn't care.  The sense of being out in the open country is palpable and the audience was so mesmerized that they didn't clap when it was over.  Kleiber had to have the orchestra stand up to indicate the end.  Then there is almost 4 minutes of pandemonium from the audience.  Add this to your collection.  Sometimes I think Kleiber is Beethoven!
0743289684|5.0|\\"Infidel\\" is the autobiography/true life story of the author, Ms. Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Ms. Ali's story is incredibly unique and unusual for a variety of reasons. If you don't believe me, just ask yourself this 1 question: How many women from Muslim States become members of Parliament in a first-world European Country?<br /><br />As someone who is very interested in World Studies, I was elated to pick up Ms. Ali's book, last year. But her story is very different from most of those other books about life in Sub-Saharan Africa in 1 very important regard; this book seems much more factual and not necessarily as sensational. And, I'm certain that Ms. Ali did not write this book to capitalize on her story or to garner fame or attention.<br /><br />The first three quarters of the book is about the author's childhood and upbringing. To say that she experienced a rough childhood would be a huge understatement. Before the age of 18 she had already lived in 4 different countries (Somalia, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and Kenya.) And, her father was only intermittently in her life. So she was basically left alone with her abusive mother and fanatical grandmother.<br /><br />Ms. Ali candidly describes some of the hardships and rituals that she was forced to face because of her family's fundamentalist beliefs. She was the victim of FGM (female genital mutilation,) and in addition, she described many horrific abusive episodes at the hands of her unstable mother.<br /><br />When her father came back into her life after she was already a grown woman he decided to marry her off! If you're unfamiliar with Fundamentalist Islamic Custom this may sound odd. But it is very common for young girls and young women to be sold into marriage, simply because they are regarded as nothing more than property!<br /><br />Or course Ms. Ali didn't want to marry a stranger and didn't want to be sold off by her father (who only came around now when he needed money to support himself and his multiple wives.) So, on her way to meet her husband (her father begrudgingly allowed 1 visit prior to the wedding,) Ms. Ali decided to flee!<br /><br />The last quarter of the book is riveting only because it's such a genuine and true story! Truth really is stranger than fiction! And truth really will set you free! Ms. Ali was able to escape during a fluke layover in Germany while traveling to meet her future would-be husband. She finally makes it to Holland and applies for refugee status and the country gladly welcomes her to safety and civility!<br /><br />I can't tell you how much I admire Ms. Ali. Because she could have given up and settled into normalcy (living off the country's generous welfare system, as many asylum seekers do,) but that was not her style! Instead, Ms. Ali got her Masters Degree from a very prestigious university and eventually she became a member of Dutch Parliament! She wanted to give back to the same people who helped her! Of course her rocky road to success was never easy and it was never fun; but it was always liberating!<br /><br />The more Ms. Ali became educated and informed, the more she learned that the way she was treated (before she came to Holland) was anything less than fair, equal or humane! It was as if the author had an epiphany and became almost emancipated once she realized this! The excitement and thought of a new beginning came beaming directly through her writings!<br /><br />By the time Ms. Ali began studying and becoming educated it goes without saying that her backwards family wanted very little to do with her. Although her father still came back into her life every once in a while to ask for money! Oh yeah, this man could sell off his daughter then \\"disown\\" her for not marrying a stranger, but when he needed to be supported he came back to his daughter for money! And Ms. Ali gladly gave it to him! What a heart of gold!<br /><br />An important lesson that I learned from this book is just how dangerous all types fundamentalism are. Not justIslam Fanatics, but all types. You know, we are always hearing about the \\"war on terror.\\" But, what about the other war? There's a war going on right this very second, in this very country! You don't believe me? Just turn on your TV and you'll see the news reports about all those tragic school shootings, mall massacres and college rampages... I'm certain that you can't measure fear and you can't measure hate or poison because it is infinite and always around! The great Michael Landon once said, \\"sometimes I think bigots are like the mountains, they're just there.\\"<br /><br />If you enjoyed \\"Infidel,\\" I also highly recommend [[ASIN:1860497586 Desert Flower]] by Ms. Waris Dirie. And, if you would like to hear about another type of radical belief-system, I highly recommend the film [[ASIN:B000KLQUV2 Jesus Camp]].<br /><br />I found \\"Infidel\\" very rewarding because it is so inspirational and encouraging.

B000001GXE|5.0|These two symphonies give you the light and the dark of Schubert.  In order to really enjoy this recording one must listen very carefully to the inner voices.  Pianissimos are so soft you can barely hear them.  Pauses are just slightly longer than expected and one of Kleiber's strengths is bringing out passages that one ordinarily doesn't hear.  Also, this is one of the more muscular renditions of Schubert.  Rhythmically the 3rd is a joy.  Be prepared to dance.  Someone should have tied this man down and made him conduct more.  Since listening to him, I've completely lost my taste for overblown, exaggerated romantic symphonies (except for Karajan).  This recording belongs in every serious musician's library (and everyone else's as well)!
B0011Z5NHS|5.0|[This review is NOT of the Dessi DVD on Hardy. Amazon has mixed-up their product page details and reviews. You might try notifying them as I have. Together we might reach a critical mass and get them to fix the problem.]<br /><br />Whether or not librettist Felice Romani had Medea in the back of his mind when he wrote Norma for Vincenzo Bellini in 1831, it is obvious that there are certain similarities in plot and mood. That inevitable comparison is heightened with this outdoor production in the huge amphitheater that is Sferisterio in Macerata Italy. Filmed in gorgeous high definition, with a minimalist set that is discretely decorated with Celtic symbols as well as Buddhist, pre-Columbian, Roman and even African signs, the mood is ancient, mythic, even Jungian. The feeling of attending a Greek tragedy as an outdoor religious observance is palpable. This is opera as ancient festival and it heightens the experience greatly. There is no denying the impact this dvd makes just with its visual elements.<br /><br />The performances are slower, more monumental in scope than in an indoor opera house. Perhaps the visual distances involved make this necessary. But it has the ancillary effect of heightening the outdoor ritual aspects of the performance. We might be in a Celtic grove amongst sacred trees, stealthily watching a Druidic ceremony. This Norma looks and feels big and luckily we have two hefty voices to fill the void. Dimitra Theodossiou as Norma has a large voice that manages to fill this vast theatrical space. Daniela Barcellona as Adalgisa has another big voice. Both are well equipped to sing these two problematic roles. Norma's difficulties are well known: Beverly Sills once recommended that the singer of the part wear comfortable shoes. And Norma nearly destroyed Renata Scotto's voice. All of the vocal performances in this production are quite good. The acting is as well, though we are witness to much broader performances than usual, given the size of the venue.<br /><br />The Orchestra Regionale delle Marche is conducted by Paolo Arrivabeni. As this is an outdoor performance, some aspects of the strings are lost in the open air and the horns are naturally emphasized. Technically, the instruments of the orchestra are nicely recorded, sounding rich and full enough both in PCM stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1, and they play quite well. The film itself is beautiful in its high definition crispness and visual clarity. The cameras emphasize close-ups, when necessary, but usually linger in the middle distance for an orchestra distance view. The opera runs for 165 minutes on two discs with no extras and a booklet written in four languages.<br /><br />This is a monumental open air Norma, the outdoor aspects of which I found both appropriate and enjoyable. It's not vintage Callas or Sutherland but it is enthralling in its own way. Recommended.<br /><br />Mike Birmanra Regionale delle Marche is conducted by Paolo Arrivabeni.

B000ICZCZS|4.0|I had never heard of this movie, but I was sick and looking for something I could rent and watch immediately without leaving my apartment.  This movie has a refreshingly different plot (not totally unique, but different enough from many contemporary movies)...and some nice character development.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it, as long as you don't mind happy endings ;)
B0000AUHOH|1.0|This movie is horrible.  I simply cannot understand viewers who give it more than the lowest rating of one star.  This movie was bad in every conceivable way.  At least STTMP was trying to be operatic, without understanding that most people (I am not one of them) find opera too long and boring, so it became all that it was trying not to be.  I loved #2 with Khan, really liked #3 because it was a transitional film to explain Nimoy being back as Spock, I loved #4 with the Whales because of it's message and its role in Spock fully realizing himself.  This however was dreck so bad that I prayed that William Shatner stay in front of the camera (a major miracle given that even though I loved the series, I think Shatner's acting blows chunks).  Luckily the studio allowed them to do #6, which was excellent -- Christopher Plummer still rocks, and set the stage for the Klingons' new position as friend.    See this movie only if you must see all of the Star Trek films.  DO NOT HOWEVER BUY THIS AS YOUR MONEY WILL BE BETTER SPENT ELSEWHERE!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|product was new in package. Delivered timely. Music is great. Good choice for a romantic evening.
B00005JKHP|3.0|This film could have been better if the father from Seven's Heaven, Stephen ? did not have that prominent a role (we see his TV wife in The Voyage Home), and Leonard Nimoy's Spock should have made an appearance much sooner as the story didn't seem to really pick up steam until he got there.  having said this, the general premise of the movie itself is sound, the special effects are solid, and the acting is pretty good given the primary actors had not worked together in about twenty years.  Overall, it's really hard to comment on this film because in so many ways, it's just there, as you can tell from my rating of 3 stars.  I love Star Trek the series and downright love or really like all the other movies with the exception of #5, so the fact that I just like this indicates what the film is, necessary to set up the return of the series by explaining what the crew has been doing and to create a scenario that brings them together again.

B000YA9R3C|5.0|Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a fanatically ambitious oilman who, through a tip provided by a farmboy named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), strikes a \\"gusher\\" in rural California. Paul's brother, Eli (also Paul Dano), strikes a verbal agreement with Daniel to sell off his family's land for $6 an acre plus a $5,000 donation to the Church Of The Third Revelation, where Eli serves as faith healing minister. But Daniel reneges on his deal with Eli and makes a point of demonstrating his physical domination over him. Meanwhile, Daniel's adopted son, H.W. (Dillon Freasier), becomes deaf after an oil derrick explosion. But Daniel seems less interested in his son's tragic injury than he is in his new found wealth, eventually sending the boy off to a school for the deaf in San Francisco.      A man claiming to be Daniel's half brother, Henry Plainview, shows up. Daniel opens up to his suppposed brother about his inner anger, bitterness and hatred of humanity. He claims to wants to become rich so he can escape from being around other people altogether. Daniel eventually discovers \\"Henry\\" is not his real brother and murders him. But his crime is discovered by a local named Banyard. Banyard says he will keep quiet if Daniel will \\"get saved\\" at the Church Of The Third Revelation and give Eli Sunday the $5,000 owed him. Daniel agrees only reluctantly since he looks down on religion as superstitious nonsense and considers Eli to be a phony. Eli uses this money to leave town and pursue his goal of becoming a famous radio preacher.     The movie then jumps from 1911 to 1927. Daniel has become extremely wealthy. But still remains a miserable and tormented soul, spiraling downward into a hell of self-loathing and alcoholism. He disowns his adopted son when H.W. tells of his plan to go to Mexico and start his own oil business. The film climaxes in an extraordinary final scene, between Daniel and Eli, that I won't give away.    The direction of Paul Thomas Anderson, the acting, the cinematography  and the score are all top notch. At over 2 hours and 30 minutes it is a lengthy film. But I remained glued to the screen throughout. It should be considered that while this movie is based on \\"Oil!\\" by Upton Sinclair, it is a very loose adaptation. Sinclair's novel had a somewhat different storyline, with different characters and a different purpose. Sinclair was, like many artists and intellectuals of his era, influenced by the ideals of socialism. He believed that capitalism was exploitative of working people and hoped for it to be replaced by a more egalitarian system.    But, to my knowledge, Paul Thomas Anderson is not an avowed Communist. Instead I believe this film has a wide variety of themes it is trying to explore. Certainly it is attempting to look at the complex relationship between business and religion. Daniel is more powerful than Eli and so perhaps the director is trying to say something about the domination of commerce in modern American life. But maybe also that there is a spiritual element lacking in our existence and we are living in a state of imbalance. In addition, he is telling the personal story of Daniel Plainview, a man driven down by his own arrogance, greed and hatred of others. After all it is because people are flawed internally that we create such imperfect social systems. Of course, these are only my speculations and I could be entirely wrong. I would enjoy hearing comments from others about the potential ideas behind the movie.    In any case, this film should definitely win multiple Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (for Daniel Day-Lewis, of course). I cannot recommend this movie highly enough, it is one of the best in years.

B0010ZR160|5.0|After a string of bad movies (Gigli, anyone?), Ben Affleck needed something to boost his faltering career. He regained a bit of his credibilaty as a good actor with last years Hollywoodland. While not a 'great' film, he gave one of his best performences in years and gained back a lot of respect from me. Now, with his directorial debut with Gone Baby Gone, he has fully recovered from his bad run and is once again a power player in Hollywood.<br /><br />This film, based on the fourth book of a series, tells of two private detectives who are called in to further investigate the mysterious dissapearence of a young girl, who's mom seems to be more interested in partying then actually taking care of the kid. Assisted by two other cops, they began to delve into the case that soon becomes obvious that there is more going on then they thought.<br /><br />Now, in essence, the above synopsis is not what the entire film is about. More like, its sort of like the first half of the film, the rest of which I cannot say or risk giving away to much.<br /><br />Both Affleck brothers do superb jobs, with Ben's refined directing and really tight screenplay and Casey giving yet another great performance after The Assasination of Jesse James. Everyone in the film does great in their roles, Amy Ryan being another standout, who makes the most of her limited screen time. And, though I don't come from Boston, I will give it to Ben for being able to capture as much of the essence of the city as possible.<br /><br />By far, the best part in the film is the ending. It really just takes you by surprise, how unexpected the end is. And, not only that, but it is very real, which makes it even more gut wrenching to watch.<br /><br />So either you love or hate Ben Affleck, this is definently a film you have to see.
B000H5TVKI|4.0|For an older film, \\"First Blood\\" turned out alright.  While the video codec could have been better, it is still leaps and bounds ahead of any DVD version of this movie.  For under $16 it was a bargain!  I enjoyed the book and I had \\"First Blood\\" on standard DVD.  But I couldn't pass up this chance to see it in 1080P.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|As far as mainstream rap music goes, Kanye keeps putting it down for all the legions of \\"underground\\" hip hop acts whose talent and creativity get marginalized because they're not dropping hip hop nursery rhyme crap that's downright crippling radio airplay lists these days.    I bought this release when it dropped but deliberately put off a first listen (minus the inescapable singles \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing,\\" \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Good Life\\" which you'd have to be living under a rock to have not heard out at a party/club/bar/lounge/hot spot) until now.    Now that the 50 v. Ye hype is history and the Grammys have past, here's what I understand about \\"Graduation.\\"  It's another strong release from Kanye who keeps getting better and better as a rapper and continues to be bold enough to experiment with hip hop's sound.      This album, conceptually, is nothing like the refreshing \\"College Dropout\\" or the more emotion-driven \\"Late Registration\\" (both great albums).  The highlight of \\"Graduation\\" is most definitely the success he has blending a more funky, almost alternative rock-edged sound and making it hip hop.    To make a third hip hop album that's still worth your money in this day and age of throwaway music is no small feat. Afterall, look at what most of this decade's quote/unquote new hip hop superstars did on Album 3  (note: Trick Daddy, Lil Wayne and Eminem don't count b/c technically they all dropped in the '90s) -- 50 Cent's \\"Curtis\\" (garbage, not that I'd even consider buying a 50 album), Nelly's \\"Sweat Suit\\" (more crap), Chingy's \\"HoodStar\\" (self-explanatory).      That leaves T.I. and Ludacris as Kanye's only peers by my count.    My only wish is that the blazing hot track \\"Classic\\" he did with Nas, Rakim and KRS-One over a throwback-sounding DJ Premier beat had made this album (visit youtube if you haven't heard this song).    I would've given this LP five-stars alone for that one!    Otherwise, Kanye succeeds in delivering an album worth the money and a thirdstraight project that goes above and beyond anything else that's out at the moment.
B000O176Q6|4.0|This is another film that I had in standard DVD but I wanted to see it in Blu-Ray.  I am glad that I did.  These older films are looking way above average on Blu.  I gave my standard copy to my son, the Blu-Ray version of \\"Enter the Dragon\\" is the only version I need.  A good sold clear display.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|I was a bit anxious about the new album from Arctic Monkeys, because most bands have problems to clear the bar of a great début. The first single, Fluorescent Adolescent, was not really what I expected from the band. I bought the record anyway, and am glad I did. FA as a single may not work, but its absolutely ok within the context of the whole album. Favourite Worst Nightmare rocks. That was the first thing I noticed. The songs are more mature, and are much harder than the ones on the first record. One could say that Arctic Monkeys just push on from where the first album ended. There is nothing that can stop these guys. If you liked the first one, you are going to love this one!
B000VD5I94|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, but I am glad I bought it on sale.  For under $16 is was a good deal.  For anything above $20 I would not get this movie.  The video transfer was just so-so.  I have seen films older than \\"Robocop\\" look much better.  Still, I didn't have this movie on standard DVD, and it does look a little better on Blu.  Buy it on sale.
0143038419|3.0|I picked this book up on a whim: I knew nothing about it, other that what I read on the back cover.  It sounded like it was going to be deep, profound and soul-searching.  Instead, what I got was one self-absorbed woman's travelogue.  And, it wasn't really that either.  Granted she took a trip (for a year), and visited various places in Italy, India and Indonesia.  Other than that, not much of interest happened.  In Italy she ate alot of food, drowning the pain of a horrible divorce (while I applaud her not going into the details of it, I think too much was made of how awful it was without sufficient detail. If she wanted to keep the details private, then she shouldn't have gone on and on about it.  After awhile, the horribleness of it all sounded empty and hollow.)  After eating her way through Italy and gaining 20 pounds, she journeys to India.    The story at the Ashram was interesting in many ways -- and, again, it all seemed so pointless.  She had some spiritual experiences, but, other than a spiritual letting go of the guy she had the affair with after her divorce, there's not alot of substance.  Just more talk about how traumatized she is.  The best part of the India piece is Richard from Texas.  His story sounds like it would make a much more interesting book.  From India, our wounded but healing heroine travels to Bali, where she does the unselfish deed of denying her friends the pleasure of buying her gifts and guilts them into giving her cash so she can give it to her Balinese friend to buy a house (granted the lady seems deserving of the assistance), but the whole gesture on Ms Gilbert's part seems more to gratify her own ego than from any real sense of genuine compassionate giving.  Somehow the 'look at me, i gave up birthday gifts, and instead got $18K from friends to give away makes me such a wonderfully spiritual person' attitude doesn't sit well with me.  If you're truly being generous, you don't seek out approval and applause.    The rest of the book becomes a sappy love story, as Ms Gilbert meets an older Brazilian gentlemen who sweeps her off her feet.  Apparently they had so much sex the first few days she got a bladder infection, which, seems an odd topic of discussion amidst the whole 'seeking spiritual fulfilment' topic of the book.  Apparently she was fulfilled in more ways than just spiritually.  The thing about the entire story that just really irks me is the whole running away thing.  We've all been through a rough breakup, we've all had our hearts broken.  But, come on, how many of us get a book advance and run away from home for a year.  Most of us schlep through our day-to-day routines, slowly healing, slowing learning, slowly growing. Most of us search and find our spiritual solace closer to home.

B000VERM8S|5.0|I recently purchased this and and \\"So Long So Wrong\\" the new vinyls made by Mobile Fidelity using their new GAIN2 super low inductance mastering system which they claim is linear up to 33KHZ. I already owned both the DVD-Video and the SACD of the live concert so I thought this woulod be a real good comparison-with of course Alison's voice being an ideal test for high frequency reproduction. The vinyl as expected blows away the digitals for naturalness and richness of sound. The detail and accuracy may be slightly better on the SACD but only slightly,while the new GAIN-2 system brings out the high harmonics in Alison's voice(on the vinyl) to an extent which should alleviate the need for Prozac or Symbalta. This really became apparent when I purchased a new Shure M97 light-tracking high accuracy cartridge-I am now saving up for a new phono-preamp.On the DVD-Video the DTS track(a format I always liked a lot) produces a beautiful surrounding richness to her voice but I recently dismantled my surround system deciding it was too much trouble and I am heading back to vinyl anyway. I can only pray they bring out her two most recent albums on this format which are much higher quality recordings-especially the new one \\"One Hundred Miles or More\\" The only complaint I have is that these LP's are rcorded at very low level forcing me to turn my pre-amp almost all the way up which brings out an annoying hum due to some grounding problem in my stereo system  I havn't tracked down yet. This low level of recording might present problems for people whose amp power or cartridge output is marginal.

B0012QE4OO|1.0|I'm a movie buff -- I love seeing films, both at home and on DVD.  I'm also very tolerant and forgiving as a movie fan -- invariably, I find something at least resonably worthwhile, or at least entertaining, about a movie.  Not so \\"Jumpers\\".  It really takes quite an awful movie to actually make me regret the ticket expense -- what's a few dollars for 90 minutes of big-screen entertainment, right?  Wrong.  As other reviewers have alluded to, \\"Jumpers\\" is simply a title (and some none-too-special special effects) in search of a plot, even the vestiges of continuity and logic, and any engagement with the audience at all.  It fails - miserably - on all three counts.  The acting is amateurish at best, the plot holes are large enough to navigate an oil tanker through, and the saddest loss of all is Samuel L. Jackson's ridiculous character and performance -- other than his paycheck, which I'm sure he happily deposited as he laughed all the way to the bank, it was a waste of a competent actor's talents.  As for the rest of the cast, the less said, the better.    But this isn't even my main gripe with this film -- there are certainly many \\"action flicks\\" that have disastrously bad acting and even a plot hole or three, yet they still can entertain.  Not \\"Jumpers\\".  Even if one forgives the utter lack of explanation and background story behind the origins of the \\"Jumpers\\" and the \\"Paladins\\", there could still have been a cohesive plot that actually progressed toward some logical conclusion.  Instead, what we have here is a non-stop chase sequence and travelogue of places throughout the world (including, ludicrously, the top of the Egyptian Sphinx's head, apparently a frequent lunch spot for our hero), a ridiculous \\"plot\\" about an age-old conflict between two groups that the world at large doesn't know exist, and...let's see, and...  I guess that's it.  Really,  There's NOTHING else to this movie.  And, irony of ironies, the most ridiculous moment comes near the end (I won't give anything away here, in case you still insist on wasting your time and money on this) -- the story gets left wide-open for a SEQUEL!!  Oh My God -- if there ever was a movie that should be left alone, dead and buried for all time, it's this one.  Please -- trust me on this.

B00005RYL2|4.0|\\"There can be only one.\\"<br /><br />Truth be told, Highlander is not the best film in the world...but it's a \\"guilty pleasure\\" film for me, dating back to my grad school days in Kingston, at Queen's University.<br /><br />So, as we were shopping around in Hong Kong a few days ago, I spotted this Video CD of the film, and picked it up, for the price of 9 HKD (about $1.25 Canadian or US), as you can see from the sticker price. My wife had never seen the movie, and I hadn't seen it since the late 90's, and I'd never experiences VCD video quality, so I figured it was a worthwhile investment, all 'round.<br /><br />The film's plot is choppier than I remembered it, with less in the way of character development, especially as it relates to the modern-day love story. The special effects relating to the Quickening weren't as elaborate as they were in Highlander: The Series a few years later, either. But, it was an entertaining watch...and the love story in the past, with Heather, is handled in a touching fashion.<br /><br />VCD quality is about the same as we would used to get on videotape, when recording TV programs...definitely not DVD quality.

B00004Y6NV|5.0|During the 1985 Live Aid concert, Dire Straits' live performances of \\"Money for Nothing\\" and \\"Sultans of Swing\\" would become one of the highlights of the Live Aid Concert.    It was also the momentum from Live Aid that propelled \\"Money For Nothing\\" to #1 song status.   It was the success of this song that would also launch 1985's \\"Brothers in Arms\\" to landmark status.   Throughout their career, Dire Straits, they would do things much differently than many of the other bands during the \\"British Invasion\\" that was taking place.   In an era where Punk and New Wave were taking center stage, Dire Straits were doing things the old-fashioned way:  a combination of Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and even some Country.    Dire Straits would take a six year layoff before releasing the follow-up to \\"Brothers in Arms\\".   That follow-up would be \\"On Every Street\\" and it would prove to the last album of the band.   While some people have been negative on this album, I think Dire Straits might have saved the best for last.    For the most part, Dire Straits is the brainchild of its lead guitarist and vocalist - Mark Knopfler.   Throughout his career, Knopfler would assemble a group of musicians that would comprise Dire Straits.   The only constant besides Knopfler has been Bassist John Illsley.  Knopfler would succeed at bringing in high quality musicians to support the unique blend of music he would write.    Knopfler is also widely considered one of music's legendary guitarists.  In addition to an album that is well written from both and musical and lyrical standpoint, it is going to be the great performances by Dire Straits as a whole that is going to make this a very special album.    \\"Brothers in Arms\\" would be the band in which Dire Straits would emerge as pop stars.  With \\"On Every Street\\", Dire Straits demonstrate their trademark sound - guitar work that has a good influence of Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and Country.   Country music has always been a staple of the Dire Straitssound and while Dire Straits isn't a Country band, they find a way to integrate it into their sound.  On \\"On Every Street\\", Dire Straits shows a lot of the country style that was found way back on 1979's \\"Communiqué\\".  There also is a strong Blues presence on this collection.    One nice thing is the fact that \\"On Every Street\\" has been remastered and you really hear the difference.   The music on this collection is going to reflect this quality - having an almost \\"three dimensional effect\\".  Here is a synopsis of each track:    \\"Calling Elvis\\": This is a very underrated song by Dire Straits and I'm surprised that with their \\"pop status\\" that this wasn't a bigger hit.   On this song, Dire Straits pay homage to Elvis Presley by writing a song about someone who believes Elvis is still alive.  This song is the perfect mix of Country and Rock and clearly has modern flair to it.    \\"On Every Street\\": Another underrated song.  The highlight of this song is going to be the use of the saxophone.  You won't hear a Country music influence on this one.  The keyboard work is going to be reminiscent of Dire Straits' work on \\"Making Movies\\".   This song does a great job at \\"switching gears\\" as it features some great guitar work toward the second half.    \\"When it Comes to You\\":  This song is going to have a big Country influence.   The country-style acoustic sounding guitars are going to be the highlights of this track.    \\"Fade to Black\\": This song has a big Blues influence to it.  While it might be a little slow-paced, Knopfler demonstrates how versatile a guitarist he is.    \\"The Bug\\":  Dire Straits demonstrates another Country/Folk track to it.  This would be a track later covered by Mary Chapin-Carpenter.  This is a catchy song and definitely one of the better Country-styled tracks by Dire Straits.    \\"You and Your Friend\\":  This is another Blues track by Dire Straits.   I think the remastering really helps here as you hear the three dimensional effect of the guitar work perfectly.    \\"Heavy Fuel\\": Awesome track.  This is a harder Rock song.  I've heard the guitar riffs compared to \\"Money For Nothing\\", but I couldn't disagree more as I think this guitar work stands on its own perfectly.  In this Knopfler sings about life's vices.   This song also demonstrates the sense of humor that Knopfler has.    \\"Iron Hand\\": This song completely blows me away.  It is a great contrast to the fast pace and hard rocking sound of \\"Heavy Fuel\\".  The highlight of this song is going to be a haunting sounding acoustic guitar.  This might be the shortest track, but it definitely is the most powerful.    \\"Ticket to Heaven\\": This song also has a softer feel to it.   This song has a Tropical and near Hawaiian sound to it.  This is a track that grew on me and also benefited from the remastering.    \\"My Parties\\": This song has become a fan-favorite, but isn't probably known to the mainstream.  It won't be the guitar that is the highlight on this track, but the combination of Knopfler's humorous lyrics with some terrific saxophone work that stands out.    \\"Planet of New Orleans\\": Very good track. It has a good mix of Blues with some terrific Classic Rock.  There also is some good use of the saxophone. These elements truly create a \\"New Orleans\\" atmosphere for this track.    \\"How Long\\": In what is the last track of the last Dire Straits album, the band wraps up by going back to the a Country roots that have been a trademark of this band.       The liner notes contain all of the lyrics to it.  Some of the credits are incomplete (instruments are not assigned to the musicians).   In way, I feel this might be Dire Straits' strongest album as they hit on a lot of the facets that have been trademarks of their career -with some pretty good music too.  Highly recommended.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|I was 21 years old in 1968. In those days, the winds of change were blowing across the world, not only in USA, but also in Europe, and here, in my country, Brazil. I would say that people, most of them young ones, were fighting everywhere for some kind of social change in their countries.  I think that the Beatles had their huge world success not only because their music was so beautiful and inspirated, but also because themselves and their songs reflected that universal wish of change.    I don't think this is a movie about the Beatles, neither a review of their music. I think it is a memory of those days, almost a documentary, that uses some of the Beatles' beautiful songs to show, to the young people of today, a day in the life of their (grand)fathers and (grand)mothers.   The songs are not sung in the usual way, but that doesn't reduce their beauty: on the contrary, I would say that some performances would be applauded by the Beatles.  The actors, many of them in their first movie, are very good.  The atmosphere of the movie also reflects the double sense that some   songs had, that is, a reference to the use of new druggs, like LSD, by people who wanted to run away from reality.    I would like to end saying that I disagree with some bad reviews.  First, this is not a movie about the Beatles.   Second, one shoudn't expect total objectivity in a movie that tries to reproduce the psychodelic side there was in some songs of the Beatles.

B00005JKLZ|1.0|This movie had some good CGI effects.  The plot idea sounded promising but the movie is alittle disappointing.  Most of the movie takes place in what is supposed to be the future.  The problem is, the future looks  like the dinasour age with cave-people.  I really expected the future to be HIGH-TECH but instead it's CAVE-MEN in huts.  So the premise is the ice-age, an astroid or some event completely kills off most of the people and cities on Earth and then everything starts evolving over again.  The main character ends up surrounded by primitive people with spears.  He later falls in love with one of them.  The time machine is lost and he doesn't care because he wants to stay there with his new love anyway.  Even the time-travel machine he builds in the beginning is a little silly looking.

079073639X|5.0|You will like this movie if you enjoy watching movies where the plot revolves around technology, the ocean and, of course, underwater scenes.  The CGI effects are very good. Most noteable is a scene where hundreds of jelly fish surround and kill a diver.  The plot in this movie centers around the 3 main characters going undersea to investigate a spaceship that was found sitting on the ocean floor.  Within the spaceship, they find a giant gold ball which seems to affect them by making their dreams come true.  Unfortuately, instead of dreaming about world peace, they only dream about scary things like snakes or wild jelly fish.  So in the end, the 3 make their way to the surface of the ocean and are sitting in a room on the recovery ship, waiting to be interviewed by the military about what they had found.  The 3 decide they don't want to tell the military about this \\"power\\" they have of making dreams come true so they agree they will just \\"forget about it\\".  The 3 join hands and on the count of 1, 2, 3 they forget about it.  Next, the ball rises up from the ocean floor and soars up and out into space.  It's gone. They wished it away.  The End. Yes---that's how it ends.

But to those new to the Smashing Pumkins I recommed they start here.  This is a double disk album that features a nice mix of what the band  was about.  It features Radio friendly songs like 1979.  Thumping Metalistic songs like Zero and Bullet with butterfly wings.  And the Artistic original songs like X.Y.U and Bodies  Even a couple of slow songs (well as slow as the Pumpkins get anyway) like Thirty Three and Tonight Tonight.  Or maybe you will become a fan of the seriously trippy songs like Porcelina or Thru the eyes of ruby.    What every part or multipe parts you like this is the CD to get you started.  If you enjoy this CD then go get (used if you can find them) Siamese Dream, Pisces iscariot, Adore and so on.    But this cd is definatly the crowning highpoint of their era.

B000FVQM2Y|3.0|I ended up with this film believing it to be a hard boiled Noir style film similar to Bound.  The main character acts like a hard boiled detective for sure, but the seriousness is way over the top.  In the beginning of the movie Brendan isn't even sure there is a \\"The Pin\\" and doesn't know what a \\"Tug\\" is.  The suspense element of the \\"not knowing\\" about them is lost as the cover of the DVD clearly shows that \\"The Pin\\" and \\"Tug\\" exist and who they are.    Other issues I had with the movie are that at the end it is assumed the audience, me, picked up on stuff that wasn't even shown during the movie, like how the girl died, what ailment Brendan has and/or how he got it.  Also based on the context it seems that the code names for certain groups changes through the movie.  At one point \\"The Bulls\\" is obviously one group, but at the end of the movie is used as a reference for a completely different group. huh?    This film wasn't a total waste, the scene at the principles office was pretty tight, the parking lot scene(s) were amusing.  I suggest you rent or flix it instead of purchasing it...make your play!

B0010YSD7M|5.0|I agree with the reviewer who said this area was to review \\"The Ark of Truth\\". As for the rest of you, the show was scheduled to end at season eight when Richard Dean Anderson was leaving the show. Fan support by write ins kept it on for 2 more seasons. How many of you wrote to Sci-Fi and/or Stargate producers & writers trying to keep it on longer than 10 yrs? With the demise of SG1, Atlantis script writing has improved. I would suggest you enjoy and support Atlantis so it doesn't go the way of SG1.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|My wife and I went to see her Vegas concert in 2004.  We were both blown away with her performance and stage presence.  Every penny spent is soo worth it.  If you think her CDs are awesome, seeing her perform live is definitely an experience you'll never forget.  I just ordered this Blu Ray version and I cannot wait to get it in the mail.  You definitely cannot go wrong with Celine Dion.

When i saw this unplugedd at first time, i knew that i was watching one of the most complete unplugged in whole history...    All the versions of song are brilliant and perfect..What can I say about a music like Oh Me? While Cobain and the rest of guys are playing you can see that show it's the end of a thing that you'll never see again...    It's all there folks.. Perfect, brilliant, smooth and amazing...    Don't think, just buy...

B0000DIJO2|5.0|This is my favorite concert tape.  I'm just so grateful this was done before Maurice made the journey.  They are the composers of the century.  Their works are so multifaceted and touch so many lives, young and old.  Robin and Barry are living treasures in my book. Thanks for making the concert available.
B000MV8AE0|5.0|I enjoyed the human aspects of the characters as portrayed, the settings, the drama, the story line, the music and the eventual triumph of it all. No one knows for sure the reality of the events of his life, so artistic license had to be employed I am sure. I believe it could have been as depicted, but even if not, the actors made me think it so.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|I saw this movie twice in the theatre and I can't wait until it's out on DVD. Tim Burton did an excellent job of reproducing this show for the big screen, I really don't think anybody else could have done a better job.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|Whats wrong with the UK? This cd is great. Vocals, and different instruments are good and steady, but the songs are all pretty different. Its right in between \\"I really need something with a beat\\", and something to sip a good glass of wine to.
0060899220|4.0|Bourdain's book claims to be the inside scoop on what a restaurant kitchen is really like.  He does, at the end, give a caveat that some new restaurants don't run the way he did/does.  The book is a good read,if a bit raw in the language.
0783231202|3.0|Amistad is a powerful movie about a real incident that had a bearing on history. Let's start with some of the many positives: Spielberg is one of our era's most talented filmmakers and his skills are certainly on display here. The film is well acted by the entire cast, especially Hopkins as former president Adams and Freeman as an abolitionist businessman. These 2 actors are always good and Amistad is no exception.  Where the film falters is when Spielberg takes \\"dramatic license\\". Putting it simply, when he lies. The real story should have been enough for a great movie so the truth shouldn't have to be stretched to overdramatize events. The slavetraders were lousy human beings without a doubt but they didn't dump half the slaves in the ocean. Adams never met any of the Africans he defended so well and their presence in a courtroom is not believable. The speeches made in the film do not reflect 1839-40 attitudes, they reflect current ones. This could have and probably should have been great. As it is, it is a well told story with too many half truths. Just filming the truth would have been better. 3.5 Stars.
0140277447|5.0|Iris Chang does not spare any details in this brutal narrative of the Japanese brutalization of the city of Nanking. This book can be hard to read at times due to the way in which Chang wrote it. I have never been moved by a book before, but there were times when I had to put this book down and do something else due to the graphic nature of Chang's account. No matter how disturbing it may have been, in the end it was worth it, because Chang portrayed the events in their true light, not glossed over or reduced in intensity, and this is what makes her work so great. This is one of the best historical works that I have ever read, and I read history for a living.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I was a child around the time Ghostbusters was a cartoon series, the best messiest line of toys to ever exist (that slime stuck to everything and my mom hated it, everything a kids toy needed to be), a sugary breakfast cereal, 4 or more lousy videogames, and remember seeing part 2 in theaters. For some reason since the 80s I have not really gone back to GB but this DVD set being cheap on top of The Angry Video Game Nerd's endless praise has led me back. This thing is awesome, best 10 bucks I've spent in awhile.<br /><br />  I have never seen Ghostbusters in widescreen and its absolutely awesome looking, every bit of the frame is crammed with action, I can't believe people use to put up with pan and scan for so long. I really want to see this in a theater one day. Nothing much to say about the movie, you know what Ghostbusters is about. One of the great 80s blockbusters, funny as hell, very well written, classic performances and action packed. I was disappointed the MST3k presentation of the commentary track wasn't included on this version, I read about it a long time ago and was looking forward to it, no real loss though.<br /><br />  The main thing I want to gripe about is Ghostbusters part 2. WHAT HAPPENED?!?! Why is this movie so sentimental and sappy? The plot just doesn't cut it simply because its more of a retread of the original film with the humor and wit dulled down. The only thing that really saves this movie is the fact that there's alot of ghostbusting and special effects to be had but all the parts in between just don't live up to the first one. The love story with the baby, just don't need it! Notice on the special features there is an episode of the cartoon that takes place right after the ending of the first film where the Ghostbusters suits soaked in Stay Puft's ecto-marshmellow-plasm become possessed by evil Ghostbusters who wreck havoc all over New York. That would have been a perfect plot for part 2! There's even a moment on the episode that works in real theories on what a ghost actually is, nothing like that is mentioned in part 2. The sly dialog, improv moments of comedy and cast dynamics are all missing from this film. Egon isn't even Egon, Bill Murray gets too sappy, Rick Moranis's character is totally unnecessary, nothing new is presented. But like I said, its action packed enough to keep itself from being completely worthless but nowhere near as fun. I won't lie though, when I was a kid I ran up to the front row with a bunch of other kids in a what could only be described as a kindergarten mosh pit during the court room scene. Well there's some venting, thats alot of words for Ghostbusters 2 but it could have been so much better, oh well.

B000Z6MIQS|1.0|Evidently the title \\"Simple Plan\\" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, \\"Time To Say Goodbye.\\" It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block. This becomes all the more apparent because Britney Spears' songwriting team was brought in to write several songs, making Simple Plan sound like a boy band. Even when they try to rock out, the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted and out of place. And there are WAY too many piano-ballads. I think any trace of the faux-punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums, which were decent efforts packed with pop-punk hooks, can permanently be removed now. Simple Plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three-plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound/style on this new one that killed their career. And the answer is neither. It is the lack of originality, energy, and songcraft that will do them in. Lets face it, when Hilary Duff rocks harder than you, your band is not \\"punk.\\" And in the three and a half years this band was away, the scene changed, but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band calls \\"unchartered musical territory.\\" Perhaps \\"UnCHARTED\\" musical territory is more like it. This one is headed to a bargain bin near you, right next to all those old LFO albums.

B000I2JKFG|5.0|This movie is a wakeup call.  Not to say that in this great nation of ours that we are headed towards the wrong way or the right way.  Just that we as a society have fallen asleep at the wheel.  It was said that every 20 years or so that a revolution needs to take place so that politicians understand that they work for the people and not the other way around.  Move has great meaning.  Some people might not like it or might need to watch it twice to grasp all that happens.  I love this movie!<br /><br />The premise of the movie is a bit like George Orwell's 1984 - the government needs to control its people and owns the news stations that report propaganda to the people.  It later comes out that certain people in the government have been terrorizing the people to take away their civil liberties.  This masked man (who was a government test subject - but survived) is out to help inform the public.  It's a matter of if he can get the public to support his revolution.  That as much as I should say to not spoil the story.
B000FPFCJ4|5.0|what can I say about Stevie WOnder that hasn't already been said?? Musical Genius and trensetter along with creating a style and vibe all his own. this DOuble Album is the kind of album which reflects a wide range of topics  from everyday life and Love and everything else in between and a Musical Blend of Stews that sizzle from start to finish.  \\"As\\" is always the song that moves as does \\"isn't she lovely\\", Another Star, knocks me off my feet, I wish, sir duke,etc... so many great songs, stylings and Production that still blows the mind some 30 plus years later. incredible Music from an Incredible Musical Genius.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|One of the major causalities of the digital age is that feeling I used to get when I rushed to a record store to buy an album the day of the release. It was always an anxious time. What if the album wasn't any good? Those days have long since passed. Most albums leak on the internet well in advance. This is mainly due to record companies sending out advanced promos of the album to various music journalists.<br /><br />The fact that Radiohead were able to release their new record In Rainbows before anyone had a chance to listen to it is refreshing. In Rainbows is another solid entry into the already impressive Radiohead catalog.  For many it will seem like a return to form, for others it's just another classic.  The album as a whole is much more cohesive than Hail to the Thief. Fans waiting for a return to the Bends/OK COMPUTER era might be disappointed, but it appears the band has come back to Earth after the experimental Kid A/Amnesiac period. The amount of ground the band has covered the past eight years is amazing. In Rainbows is another great album from Radiohead.  I've let this album sink in after a few months and it just gets better with time.  No band in my lifetime has influenced me more than Radiohead.  This album is a true gift to the fans.
B0010HOZXA|3.0|Falsely advertised and promoted as a romantic comedy/charming/summer hit movie, as noted in other reviews here at Amazon.com this movie is not a romantic comedy, or at least not a prototypical romantic comedy.<br /><br />There's romance in the story, but it's not the prime focus.  There's also comedy, but again, not the prime focus.<br /><br />Mostly there's a story of an overly stressed and tightly wound head chef for a busy restaurant in a big city environment who has inherited her sister's only child and has been somewhat forced to work with a chef she didn't get to select and approve of before his hiring.<br /><br />The movie is entertaining enough to rate 3 stars, but in trying not to be any one type of movie there seems not to be much of an identity here at all.<br /><br />People that have worked in the restaurant business, or who are interested in the restaurant business may enjoy the film a bit more than others as it offers a bit of a behind the scenes look at the restaurant business.  Then again, you could turn the TV on and watch Hell's Kitchen, Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, the Food Network or similar material to gain some of the same insights.<br /><br />Again, as another reviewer here mentions, if you are a fan of either of the stars, you also might get more enjoyment from the movie.<br /><br />On Blu-ray disc the picture looks good, audio levels were consistent, background music not overly distracting.<br /><br />Worth the purchase?  Probably better as a rental for most.

0800177355|5.0|I read the reviews for this movie here before I bought it for cheap.  Based on the reviews, I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. I am a Stallone fan, so that will influences my review.  I watched the first scene or two and turned it off.  I thought the movie was going in a direciton that would be boring, so I waited until I was bored to watch the rest of it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was different than I expected, with twists and surprises.  The other characters -- good ones and bad ones -- played their roles well. It brought me through a whole range of emotions.  The background shots are beautiful; I wish my t.v. screen was larger.  This would have been fantastic on the big screen of a movie theater.
B000U7169M|2.0|Your time might be better spent engaged in an activity like catching up on the laundry or going out. The movie warns of \\"disturbing images\\", I found the only thing to be disturbing was that the creators actually found someone to finance such a B.S!!! C
1558908420|3.0|If I were not a Stallone fan, this might have been a good movie.  Stallone's character in this film doesn't have the edge most of us love in his other films.  Here, his character is less aggressive and less intelligent.  Still, it was an okay movie.  It reminded me of t.v. cop shows/t.v. movies in the late 70's and 80's.  My mom is not a Stallone fan.  I lent her the movie and she really enjoyed it. She didn't have the Sly expectations going into it that I did, and I think that made the difference.  It was inexpensive to buy, so I'm still glad to add it to my Sly collection.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Good quality collections with lots of extras. Most importantly, the original pilot is included for the first time!
B0004Z33F0|5.0|I thought Rambo II was better than Rambo I, and I didn't think the writers/directers, etc. could top Rambo II.  Rambo III is different because the war is in Afghanistan against the Russians instead of Vietnam. Still, it was terrific.  John Rambo's character is even more mature, yet still hasn't come \\"full circle\\" as his former commanding officer tells him. This one has lots of action, enough fighting to keep guys interested and enough relational themes to keep gals happy -- not to mention that Sly actually looks even better in Rambo III than in Rambo II.  I didn't think that was possible.  Ladies, if you like Stallone and haven't seen this one, your life is about to get better! Order it today! Keep a drool bag handy.
0143038419|5.0|This book was a great suggestion; received it very quickly; I am more than very satisfied.
B0000640S2|5.0|I loved Rambo II.  We get to see John Rambo back in Vietnam -- \\"in his element\\" as the saying goes.  His character is better developed.  We get to see him coming from a place of strength instead of a place of weakness as in Rambo I. His misplaced aggression in the first movie is re-directed in a positive direction in this one.  Because he engages a real enemy in Rambo II, there is more violence and blood than in the first one. He looks better in the second one, too!!
B0000TG9E2|4.0|For anyone out there [like me] who is a Disney Movie Rewards member, this is not an eligible movie. I bought this movie to update my Disney collection and also because I wanted to rack up the points for the Disney Movie Rewards program. The rest of the classic [digitally remastered] DVDs that I've purchased from a regular retail store has always come with insert [code], but this one [and Cinderella] did not. They also did not have the commemorative slip-on cover. It was just the plain DVD case. Which is fine, but it did not match the rest of my collection. Other than that, the movie's great and my order came on time.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|i liked it, but i wish it was longer!!  the songs are very good, though i'm sure they can't POSSIBLY have all the music from the movie on it... but i did like it and the songs get stuck in your head very easily!! i listened to it once and had to again and again because i liked it so much! the only thing preventing me from giving it a five star is the short length... but it is still a great soundtrack!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This is Great Cd it gets my mood up when im feeling lazy! i especially like GET Naked, Piece of me-where she talks about how the poparatsy view her. and Gimme More-i love It's Britney [..] part.

0446577391|5.0|The Collectors, the second installment of the Camel Club, left me looking at my watch and tapping my foot in anticipation of the next installment. There had to be more to this compelling story.  Would Annabelle survive the vengeance of Jerry Bagger?  What adventures would befall the members of the Camel Club next? In Stone Cold, David Baldacci does not disappoint.  In spite of being written with the film camera in mind, this is a totally satisfying read. Character and plot development are not sacrificed.  Only a few authors can create the conflict I experienced listening to this book on my commute. The conflict between wanting to know the plot's outcome and not wanting to leave these fully developed characters.  It's a delicious place for a reader.  Baldacci wrote a totally engaging read; it was a great treat. I look forward to the further adventures of the Camel Club.
0618918248|2.0|\\"The God Delusion\\" is the book which, according to the author, will promptly make Christians drop our God act and gawk in amazement at how we were totally fooled.  I hate to disappoint, but that wasn't my reaction.  Indeed, it's tough to imagine that anyone could view this book as anything but an insult to their intelligence.  \\"The God Delusion\\" is a farrago of insults, lies, misrepresentations, logical contradictions, urban legends, internet myths, and pseudoscience.  And when honest arguments do creep in, they never present anything that any informed person hasn't heard before.    Dawkins gives himself a pat on the back for not insulting anyone, yet he's not even through the introduction before declaring that anyone who disagrees with him is a moronic slave of \\"childhood indoctrination\\".  This sets the tone for the rest of the book, including a chapter where he calls religious children \\"demented\\".  So much for politeness.  He doesn't do much better on the honesty front.  He repeats fabricated quotes attributed to George Bush, Ronald Reagan, and others.  He parrots an internet legend about an English pediatrician being mistaken for a pedophile.  None of this would be particularly worth noting, except that he repeatedly blasts Christians for not checking all their beliefs with the proper authorities.  Biologist, heal thyself.    Yet the reader may well prefer that sort of factual bumbling to the chapters where Dawkins takes on religion from a philosophical angle.  There, almost everything strikes one as both condescending and dumbed-down.  For instance, in response to Saint Thomas' proof of the existence of God, Dawkins says, \\"it doesn't prove that God has the properties such as love, compassion, and forgiveness.\\"  Of course Saint Thomas addresses exactly those questions, but Dawkins uses selective quoting to pretend that he doesn't.  Such intellectual dishonesty will do little to win converts.    Dawkins uses this tactic of rewriting Christian beliefs to better suit his needs throughout.  For instance, he devotes a whole chapter to explaining why God couldn't have arisen from the primordial ooze.  Christians don't believe that God arose that way, or any other way; God has existed always and has no beginning.  No religion supports such an interpretation, as far as I know, so the entire chapter refutes nothing.    The crux of the book is chapter five, where Dawkins argues that religious belief is a byproduct of our genes.  To that end he presents conjectures about why such genes evolved.  He says that certain genes force children to believe and obey adults.  (This would certainly come as a surprise to any parent!)  The question of why adults have religious beliefs is not addressed.  What he doesn't offer is evidence that these genes exist, or even that such genes are possible.  To his credit, Dawkins is honest about the lack of evidence.  But that raises the question, how can he argue this way while also demanding that his opponents provide proof for their beliefs?    Speaking of contradictions, Dawkins throws in a chapter on childhood where he begins by trashing the Catholic Church for once removing a Jewish boy from his home in the 18th century.  A few pages later, he demands that all religious children be snatched away from their parents--or at least that parents shouldn't be allowed to decide how their kids are raised.  Forget the moral atrocity--where does he intend to find enough atheist nannies to do the job?  Somewhat after that, he claims there can't be religious children, because children are incapable of meaningful decision making.  Ah, well.    Frankly, documenting all the mistakes in this book requires a more patient person than me.  Some clearly like this book.  Some folks who think that James Randi is hardcore and that the Flying Spaghetti Monster is a really original and clever argument.  For the rest, though, the only appeal of this book is nostalgia.  It harkens back to the day when academics could ladle out hatred and disdain on ordinary people.  Thankfully that attitude is in decline, but \\"The God Delusion\\" shows that it's not going quietly.
1577314808|5.0|This book is exactly what the title says.  Learned a big deal from it.  Great, easy read.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|Anyone who's a fan of the Blues usually has at least a passing interest in the history of the only \\"true\\" American roots music. Everyone who has viewed my DVD has bought their own copy....it's that good and that well done. Like several other reviewers attested to, this could have easily been marketed as a DVD with a bonus CD. Having seen more than a few of these performers live through the years it saddened me to find some had passed on between the taping and the release. This CD/DVD set is a great window into the past and present of the Blues, done with the respect and reverence it deserves. You'll find the money very well spent.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|Where was the industry support for what I feel was the best movie in 2007?  It was 2 hours of absolute entertainment, story, scenery, film technique, acting, memory, and above all - the music!  It held myself and my daughters (17,22) mesmerized throughout the entire show.  I tell everyone - to make sure they take the time to watch this one.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|Imagine if you will you are part of an elite team of astronauts on a mission to save the Sun from extinction to perserve the fate of mankind, would you honestly believe that boarding the spaceship christen the \\"Icarus 2\\" will bode well?  You will see what happened to the first crew of first \\"Icarus\\" ship who had gone on to the \\"save the Sun mission\\" seven years prior to this one.      Sorry that was a bit of a spoiler, however the cast Cillian Murphy and Michelle Yeoh and company deserved a better script.  The cgi is done beautifully, however there is just something missing to this film that prevented me to give it a four star rating.  I would suggest that you view it as a rental (digital download) before purchasing the film.
B00065GX64|5.0|The extras and commentary are very inciteful.  This film is essential to anyone interested in German film and recommended for anyone who is interested in classic film in general.  This 2-disc DVD is very well put together.  The insert pamphlet includes reviews of the film and some other very interesting information.  It's a great resource for learning about this film.  I have really enjoyed it.
B00005JPAO|4.0|This movie did a good job of showing how the public eye sees reality and how that reality could be seen from the eyes of those in the public.  This gives a dramatic review of how the events around the Death of Diana could have unfolded.  The acting was done quite well and it was easy to move into this reality for a bit.  You even felt compassion for the Royal family and for the difficult situation that the Prime Minister was in.  In the end, it was a good movie for expanding the understanding of what happened from another perspective.
0553805460|3.0|I have read many tell all stories by Wall Street crooks and they all have one thing in common, they tell you what happened. Belfort starts out by telling you about first getting into the brokerage business and then fast forwords to his own successful career. He briefly describes his firm, Stratton Oakmont and some of his employees, but nothing in depth. Some of his deals are mentioned, but really nothing about why his business was so crooked it finally led to his arrest. The arrest at the end comes as sort of a surprise because he makes it seem that he did nothing wrong, but if he did, he no longer does.    The main theme of the book is Belfort's depraved lifestyle. He focuses way too much time on his wife \\"The Duchess\\" and his household. Most of the book describes his immense drug abuse, drinking, partying, prostitutes and overall waste of a life and great quantities of money. I expected more.
B000001FS6|1.0|Bono's attempt to cover the Beatles Helter-Skelter is incredibly amateur.  He can't get the timing or the lyrics right. Why would he film himself doing a song when he doesn't know the words?  Compare Bono's take on Helter-Skelter to the original if you get a chance.  If you know the song it is worth a good laugh.     Bono is the last person who should be remaking Beatles songs for profit.  Bono has pompously compared his inept, politically motivated band to the Beatles. The Beatles had 27 Number 1 hits in 7 Years.  U2 have 6 Number 1 hits in 30 years (4 UK and 2 US Billboard Hot 100)  The Beatles did it in 7 years if U2 were going to be the next Beatles they missed the window back in the eighties.  I am sure all the hardcore U2 fans hate to hear it but the facts are in the hits.
B00000JTB2|4.0|I've been known to find cooperative efforts between guitar masters to be less than fulfilling, likely due to the high expectations I have from seeing two such names on an album cover.  This, however, is an exception.  Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan, mentor and protege, play the Hell outta these blues!  And there's little doubt that they're having a great time doing so, playing some classic blues selections, with the notable appearance of Vaughan's own \\"Pride and Joy\\" and King's \\"Blues at Sunrise.\\"<br /><br /> All in all, it's a great, fun blues album, featuring two of the masters.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|If you are in the mood for a gentle, endearing movie, then \\"Once\\" is a gem. Realistic dialog, believable situations, acting that is entirely natural (likely to happen when the leads aren't actors but actual musicians!) in a story that isn't forced. If you want a Hollywood fairy tale, this is not for you. It is a modern musical in that songs are used in their entirety and to advance the story rather than just being relegated to the background soundtrack; the music and lyrics depict the emotions of the leads and are the heart and soul of their relationship.    Thank God for Sundance which lets independent films like this find the audience they deserve. While $20 seems a lot to pay for a DVD these days, given that the entire budget of the film was $160 K, I can't begrudge anyone associated with \\"Once\\" a bit of profit if it will help them make another film like this!

When shooting people indoor you can really get a nice ambient light when you bounce it off ceiling or wall. I don't no the difference between a SB-400 and a SB-600 but the difference in the built in flash n SB-400 completely justifies the extra purchase. Try it your self n see the difference.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I found The Tudors to be a wonderful production, and as a student of the period, I found the sets and the costumes to be exquisite.  There were a couple of mistakes made in the historical aspect of the production; i.e., the Duke of Richmond (King Henry's son through Elizabeth Blount)did not die as a child, but died at the age of 17 years of age from consumption (tuberculosis).<br /><br />The Duke of Buckingham was descended from Anne of Gloucester, \\"Countess of Buckingham\\", daughter of Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham (later Duke of Gloucester), youngest son of King Edward III of England. Stafford was an important supporter of the House of Lancaster in the Wars of the Roses, and was killed at the Battle of Northampton in July 1460.  He was succeeded by his grandson, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who aided Richard III in his claiming the throne in 1483 (Edward IV of England's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville having been declared null and void and Edward's sons illegitimate by Act of Parliament Titulus Regius), but who then led a revolt against Richard and was executed later that same year. HIS SON, EDWARD STAFFORD, 3RD DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM, WAS RESTORED TO THE TITLE UPON HENRY VII'S ASCENSION TO THE THRONE IN 1485, BUT HE WAS ULTIMATELY EXECUTED FOR TREASON IN 1521 DUE TO HIS OPPOSITION TO CARDINAL THOMAS WOLSEY, HENRY VIII'S CHIEF ADVISOR. AT THIS TIME THE TITLE BECAME EXTINCT.

0786930640|4.0|I first read this series when I was in high school, many moons ago and I loved it. I thought it was the best fantasy setting ever, in fact in my mind it was much better than Tolkien. I know...I know before anyone flies off the handle let me explain.   Fantasy can be compared to rock n' roll, the Beatles were the first and started it all,even though they borrowed from influences before them as did Tolkien. Like the Beatles, Tolkien should receive his due as the first but just like rock n' roll there have been those that have done it better since the Beatles. I feel the same about Dragonlance. I thought the races and history was much more interesting and well thought out.   Yes some of the characters are cookie cutter and some of the story is predictable but that doesn't mean it's not a good read.   I don't understand these reviewers who complain that this or that fantasy novel is too predictable, it's high fantasy! Just like romance novels, mysteries and westerns. Fantasy is just another genre, if you read much fantasy as many claim then you should be able to tell from the plot summary whether your going to be reading a so-called cliche or not.   With novels like this it is just a good read with the classic fantasy races given a new history and story line, read it for that and I guarantee you will enjoy it.

Y sobre todo, a partir de el crea variaciones que toman senderos originales, para explorar el mundo que es insinuado por las imagenes de la pelicula. Es decir Vangelis retrata musicalmente a la creación del director Ridley Scot, pero no se contenta con ello, profundiza para hacer sus aportaciones y enriquecer la obra de arte, de manera que estos CD cobran vida propia tomando caminos paralelos a donde se inspirarón.
B00005JPXY|4.0|It took a while for \\"Cloverfield\\" to come to the Zenith City.  I am not sure if it has to do with the fact that we only have two movie theaters, both with ten screens apiece, or the fact that this particular chain has been fighting some of the studios over money (we had to wait over a month for \\"[[ASIN:B000TLTUL0 Sweeney Todd]]\\" to come to town.  So instead of going the first weekend I did not check out \\"Cloverfield\\" until today, which means I had seen the stories about how the movie was making physically ill because of all the hand held camera work.  Ever since the small craft searching for Luke and Han in \\"[[ASIN:B000FQJAJG The Empire Strikes Back]]\\" came over the ridge and the landscape dropped away I have been away that such things in movies can make my head explode.  It is one of the reasons that I only saw the first [[ASIN:B000W07EKW Bourne]] movie in the theaters; I knew I could never make it through the other ones except on the small screen.  So what ever made me think I could happen \\"Cloverfield\\" is beyond me.<br /><br />Yes, this is all my own damn fault.  I should have gone directly to the back row of the theater, but I only went back about three-quarters, and when my daughter offered to buy popcorn I should have said \\"No.\\"  I did make a point of not watching everything in the opening act of the film (i.e., before the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the street), so that I could watch the good parts.  But it turns out that the good parts include the camera work most likely to make you look at that popcorn bucket as the world's most accommodating barf bag.  All told I probably watched a third of the movie, and half of that indirectly; however, I did listen to the whole thing and managed to sneak a peak at all of the key scenes while my head was spinning and chills went through my body (I have been listening to some of the radio dramas included in \\"Twilight Zone: The Complete Definitive Collection,\\" so I have recent experience with coming up with pictures in my head, even when it is spinning like a top).<br /><br />Basically, \\"Cloverfield\\" takes \\"[[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]]\\" approach to a giant monster movie.  For most people the only point of reference on the later will be \\"[[ASIN:0767817478 Godzilla]],\\" which is pretty disappointing, but us older folk we can think back to not only the original \\"[[ASIN:B000FA4TLQ Gojira]]\\" movie, but \\"[[ASIN:B0000B1OGE The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms]]\\" and films of that type.  The film I am reminded most of is Spielberg's \\"[[ASIN:B00005JNTI War of the Worlds]],\\" because it also keeps the focus on a small group trying to survive, with only the vaguest sense of what is happening; no multi-starred generals ordering troops to their deaths or scientists postulating on where the beastie has come from.  Our vantage point is a farewell surprise party for Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who is heading for a job in Japan.  His brother Jason (Mike Vogel), hands over the video camera to his bud Hud (T.J. Miller), and because of what the camera shows us we are able to pair the three boys up with three women: Lily (Jessica Lucas), Beth (Odette Yustman), and Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).  After midnight there is an initial explosion that has everybody running for the roof.  The next thing they know, everybody is running for their lives.<br /><br />Of course, any sane, rationale human being would ditch the frigging video camera early on once the world goes to hell in a hand basket, but Hud is not the brightest bulb in the world and in a world where everybody stops in the middle of a monster attack to whip out their cell phones and take pictures, there is a sense that documenting the end of the world as we know it could be a good thing.  So, yes, it is a conceit that becomes pretty unrealistic by the end, but without it, there would not be a movie (Besides, the stupidest decisions of the night belong primarily to the guilt-ridden Rob).  The bigger concern with such movies is how things holdtogether once the monster shows up; it was almost a given in 1950s black & white science fiction movies that once the monster showed up and we got to see what it looked like things would quickly head downhill.  I think the best part of the movie come before we see the creature, with all of those images reminiscent of 9/11, but I was not disappointed by what the CGI put together.  It is just that my preference for movie monsters are more the size of \\"[[ASIN:B00009NHC0 The Thing from Another World]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B00000ILDE Aliens]].\\"<br /><br />The opening pretty much indicates how this is all going to end, and the movies runs less than 90-minutes, which was a blessing.  \\"Cloverfield\\" is a one-trick pony, but once things start happening here they happen pretty much without respite and you have to admit that it provides the rollercoaster ride it promises, including the whole bit of making you physically ill.  The results are not great, but it is not like giving Hud a steady-cam would have improved the experience enough because such monster movies always have gaping holes in logic.  Still, all things considered, I approve of this guerilla-style monster flick.er shows up; it was almost a given in 1950s black & white science fiction movies that once the monster showed up and we got to see what it looked like things would quickly head downhill.

1590581814|5.0|The publishing industry is filled with predictable books. By that I don't mean just formula genre books, such as most romances, action-adventure books, and mysteries, but mainstream books with predictable elements: anti-hero, rising arcs of action over three hundred or so pages, happy ending or not, closure. Such elements have become so ingrained in the industry that books that go against them must be so strongly written that readers (and critics) overlook the lack of familiar elements. In Drive, the powerful prose of James Sallis provides just such a distraction, in a book so off-beat that we never even learn the protagonist's name.<br /><br />Written in the best noir style, Drive opens, literally, in a pool of blood. The protagonist, whose name is never more than \\"Driver\\", spends part of his time as a stunt driver for the movies, and another part driving for criminals. As the book opens, his work for (the non-Hollywood) criminals has taken a terrible turn, and Driver finds his life completely unhinged. The rest of the book explores how Driver has come to be in this situation, and how he might get himself out. As the story unfolds across Arizona and southern California, Sallis's lean and powerful prose draws a stark image of a man on the fringe of society, in a dark world that most of us only see in the corners of our eyes as we drive quickly by.<br /><br />From a writer's perspective, Drive is an excellent example of handling flashback. Common advice for writers is to begin \\"in media res\\"-in the middle of the action. Drive takes this to the extreme, beginning only a few days before the end, but telling a story that sweeps across a span of years. What does that mean for a story? Flashback, and lots of it. Probably two thirds of the book is flashback, and while that can be the kiss of death for a story in the hands of an amateur, Sallis handles it flawlessly. Despite the dramatic jumps backward and forward in time, a reader goes through the pages without feeling lost. Instead, the narrative comes together as a jigsaw puzzle, with the pieces falling into place one by one until the final, inevitable, piece completes the picture.<br /><br />Cover to cover, Sallis puts on a demonstration of the style and structure of quality writing. Drive easily could be (and surely will be if it isn't already) used as a textbook in a creative writing class. It's that good.<br /><br />Drive is an excellent book, written by a veteran author who really understands books and writing. Any fan of noir should not miss it, and anyone who enjoys a solid story wrapped in excellent prose should not miss it either. That, in my opinion, should include everyone.narrative comes together as a jigsaw puzzle, with the pieces falling into place one by one until the final, inevitable, piece completes the picture.

B000000WJZ|5.0|This album is quite a tough one for me to judge. Upon my first listen, I was not that impressed as I was completely captivated in Nirvana's albums and Smashing Pumpkins other masterpiece \\"Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness\\".<br />Little did I know this was actually a really really really shining part of the Pumpkins catalogue.<br />This has to be one of the 90s greatest albums. It doesnt sound dated like \\"Ten\\" or other alt. rock albums.<br />It bugs me that no one ever really acknowledges this album when referring to the 90s or the Pumpkins.<br />It is a fantastically produced, quiet/loud, layered big album!<br />I still count \\"Mellon Collie\\" as their best album for its sheer adventurous genre hopping sound, but this album, (for only 1 disc!!) is early 90s music at its pinnacle!<br />The Best songs here are:<br />Cherub Rock (Great opener, big rocker track, fantastic sound!)<br />Quiet (The distorted Pumpkins sounds awesome on this other rocking track)<br />Disarm (One of my all time favourites..absolutely incredible sounding song)<br />Today (Classic)<br />Soma (I loved the layered sound, also the gradual peak from quiet to loud to quiet...awesome)<br />Mayonaise (I love Mayonaise so much..The live acoustic version from Earphoria is another must hear song!!)<br />Spaceboy (Another absolute favourite..it proves The Pumpkins were from a different type of genre when compared to heavyweights Nirvana and Pearl Jam)<br /><br />All in all, I really recommend this album..its right up there with the all time great albums and all these 5-star reviews arent for nothing...it really is a genuine 5 star masterpiece which evolved from their 1st album \\"Gish\\" and really helped them establish their own sound. Buy this now!!! You are missing out!

This is one of his calmest albums besides In a Silent Way and my favorite songs are Freddie Freeloader and So What.

I really would recommend this CD to all rock fans who need to calm down now and then and this is a must-have cd. Go get it today.

The author, involved in one of the most exciting and important paleontological discoveries of all time, gives us not only a self-effacing account of that discovery, but, moreso, a first class popular account of our morphological and genetic connections with the \\"lowliest\\" of creatures.

B0000041DF|5.0|Ms. Argerich plays two of the standard piano concertos in almost any soloist's repetoire. She does not play them mechanically or with the standard interpretation. With the two conductors and the orchestras she makes a statement in each composition about the music that is an experience that even those who have heard these played by other reknown soloists should not be missed. She touches the emotion and passion that both Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky brought to the music they composed. Purchase these and enjoy the experience of a musical event, beautiful and unforgetable.
0446679089|4.0|I really enjoy reading Nelson DeMille, who is tremendously gifted in writing books that are both funny and highly suspenseful.  PLUM ISLAND is a nice showcase for DeMille's talents.<br /><br />PLUM ISLAND is the first book to feature John Corey, a NYPD homicide detective who DeMille has written about in three subsequent novels.  Corey is the ultimate wise-acre, a bit like David Addison from the old TV show MOONLIGHTING.  If you like your dialogue funny and snappy and filled with sexual innuendo, this book will easily meet your requirements.  But if you dislike smart alecks in general, you may find Corey a difficult main character to root for.<br /><br />The plot of PLUM ISLAND, involving biological warfare and pirate's treasure, is kind of absurd, but was interesting enough to keep me turning the pages.  As some other reviewers have commented, this book is written in a long-winded style, especially at the beginning.  For example, DeMille spends over a hundred pages describing a lengthy tour of a biological research facility, when maybe thirty would have sufficed.  Still, DeMille keeps things entertaining for the most part, although I think this book could have been at least a hundred pages shorter.<br /><br />Overall, PLUM ISLAND is a fun book, and DeMille is definitely a writer you should try if you like your thrillers with a heavy dose of humor.  If you've never read DeMille before, I recommend either this book or THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER.
B000002KHF|4.0|Van Morrison-Moondance ****1/2<br /><br />Moondance is the album that broke Van Morrison in to the mainstream as a major solo artist. While Astral Weeks is clearly his strongest album, as well as his most criticly acclaimed album, and still to this day concidered to be one of the top albums of all time, it is Moondance that really broke him through to the rest of the world. Of course he always had the success of Them, and 'Gloria' which went on to be just a classic, and 'Brown Eyed Girl' may have been his first hit single, many did not relealize that was Morrison on his own.<br /><br />'And It Stoned Me' the fantastic title track 'Moondance' along side 'Crazy Love' and 'Caravan' were the first four songs to lead off the album and all four went on to be hit singles for Morrison making him a major pop star. His soul-ful vocals and heartfelt lyrics can be heard through out the entire album on songs like the cleaver title track, and 'Brand New Day' but maybe most importantly on the albums strongest track, the chilling 'Into The Mystic' which aside from 'Sweet Thing' off Astral Weeks may be Van Morrisons Best song ever. \\"We were born before the wind, but so younger then the son,\\" how can you even compare another lyric to that genius?<br /><br />Moondance solidified Van Morrison as not only a brilliant Irish poet, but a major musical attraction. Along with his first album Astral Weeks, these two albums help so growth in Van Morrison as well as depth, in that there was much more to him then garage rock, even though he may have written the greatest garage rock song of all time in 'Gloria.' Moondance is a special album that you can play during any mood, and one that is reccomended to all along side Astral Weeks.

B000NVI1IO|3.0|AC/DC-Stiff Upper Lip ***1/2<br /><br />All the right ingrediants are there, but it just feels like something is still missing. Stiff Upper Lip is bluesier than any of AC/DC's other albums with the exception Powerage. It's got the feel of something from every time period of AC/DC's career.  The hard driving no non-since rockers like the albums strongest track 'Safe In New York City' and the late 80's early 90's areana rock 'Meltdown' to the feel of very early AC/DC with the albums title track 'Stiff Upper Lip.' So why then doesn't this album satisfy like it seems it should?<br /><br />As far as the cast of characters, well Angus is playing some of the best guitar of his career in my opinion. Malcom is writing some of the bands strongest songs in years, I really do mean in years! Brian Johnson who I have always liked better then Bon Scott, is sounding great as ever and coming on as strong as ever. Then their is Cliff Williams who is always a fine bass player. But then last we have Phill Rudd, who is my opinion is one of the finest drummers in all of rock history. AC/DC has always been known for fantasttic drummers.<br /><br />But you see songs like 'Hold Me Back' and the title track 'Stiff Upper Lip' have the same guitar riff, almost exactly, which coincidently is the same guitar riff as 'Thunderstruck' was about a decade earlier. 'House Of Jazz' is a good song, with maybe the best solo on the album, but you feel cheated because you can tell something went wrong. Put it this way, the song could have been great instead of just good. As for 'Can't Stand Still' that seems to be slightly ironic as the song repeats the same thing over and over and over again, and that at this late stage in the bands career they still have not managed to grow as a band. This song once again has the same riff as 'Thunderstruck' and on further throught, the same as 'For Those About To Rock' did in the early 80's.The song should have been left off the album as it is the worst thing they have recorded since the Fly On The Wall and Flick Of The Switch albums in the 1980's. Finally, one of the albums stronger songs 'Can't Stop Rock 'N Roll' sounds like a rehasing of 'For Thos About To Rock' as well, not to mention several other classic songs in the bands 80's material.<br /><br />So what seems to be the issue here is AC/DC, once one of the top hard rock bands of all time has become a parody, not of hard rock, but of themselves. They are clearly running through the motions. I know AC/DC's modo has always been if it isn't broke then why fix it but at this juncture it's time to change the formula or call it a day. When songs are just recycled versions of others, and of classics by the same band then there is a problem. I know they have been known for a sound but this seems forced, it's no wonder it is taking so many years for the band to create a follow up to this album.On The Wall and Flick Of The Switch albums in the 1980's.

B00005JPSM|4.0|I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that although billed as a romantic comedy, this movie is neither very romantic nor a comedy.  The whole story of the sister dying and her little girl coming to live with Kate is really quite sad. I have to assume CZJ was drabbed down a bit for this role.  Aaron Eckhart has a great time with his part - an opera singer he is not, but a great lover of life, yes indeed.  There is not a whole lot of chemistry between the leads, but thank God Nick is there to help Kate get used to the idea of being responsible for another human life, because she really struggles.  I am somewhat ambivalent toward this movie.  I wanted more in terms of character and relationship development.  How well did Zoe know her aunt before she had to come live with her?  Really, if Nick was such a catch as a sous-chef, why didn't he have a job as head chef at another restaurant?  And without giving away the ending (except to say that it very much reminded me of the end of Waitress), the journey between the penultimate scene and the final scene would have made a pretty good movie in itself.  However, I was consistently entertained and occasionally touched, and I think I will have to look up Mostly Martha now.

It is extraordinarily well-written, well acted, and brilliantly edited -- with outstanding special effects. I cannot comprehend why I never heard of this film before it appeared here on UNBOX. Perhaps we movie lovers have just gotten spoiled? This film is ideally seen on a large high-def screen. It is a visual masterpiece, a stunning achievement.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|Mildred Pierce features the best performance of Joan Crawford's career and it bagged her the Oscar for Best Actress in the process.     She stars as the title character, the doting Mother of two spoiled daughters, the young Kay and the vicious, money hungry Veda.     After Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford) finds out that her husband (Bruce Bennett) has been unfaithful, the pair seperate and ultimately divorce. She is left completely dependent on herself and as a result, has to get a job waitressing to help pay the bills.     Veda - played brilliantly by Ann Blyth, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress - soon becomes sick of the family's hard times and demands that her Mother provide her daughters with a better life. Mildred then seeks advice about opening up her own restaurant from realtor Wally Fay (Jack Carson) who introduces her to Monte Beragon (Zachary Scott), a property owner.     The film begins with Beragon's murder which Mildred admits to immediately and then progresses as she tells her story from the beginning. However, as she relates the events to the police, several different things seem suspect. Is Mildred lying, and if she is, will the truth come out in the end?     An excellent film noir from the Golden Age of cinema, the film was nominated for six Oscars - including Best Picture - and was directed by Michael Curtiz, the director of Casablanca. Joan Crawford is astounding as a desperate woman willing to do anything to protect her ungrateful children. The supporting cast are also on top form and the film is a joy to look at, beautifully photographed and fully restored.

B000PMFS2I|5.0|Showgirls is an excellent cult film. Its filled with terrible dialogue delivered by actors in performances that they'd surely rather forget. Paul Verhoeven - usually a top notch director - fails spectacularly with his fourteenth film and the script by Joe \\"I Don't Know Anything About Women\\" Eszterhas is laughable.     It stars Elizabeth Berkley as Nomi Malone (She's alone in the world, get the joke?), an ambitious young woman who has dreams of becoming a famous dancer in Las Vegas. Berkley's performance is something else. She smiles, she pouts, she shouts, she screams, she gyrates, she vomits, and often all of the above in the same scene. She is joined by Gina Gershon and Kyle MacLachlan, both similarly hamming it up to the extreme as Berkley's fellow dancer and the \\"Entertainment Director\\" respectively. Glenn Plummer also waves goodbye to any credibility in his performance as Berkley's quasi-love interest.     From reading this review you may wonder why I have given it five stars. The reason is this: You will never be more entertained in your life. It is hilarious, outrageous, ridiculous, completely unrealistic, shallow, stupid and ultimately a misunderstood masterpiece of everyone involved in the production doing everything wrong in perfect synchronicity.     The complete ignorance of all involved is obvious if you take a look at the Special Features on the DVD. If you watch the short making-of programme, the film is described by Eszterhas as \\"an all out rock and roll musical\\" which is unbelievable. First of all, the choreography of the dance scenes at the 'Goddess' show is ridiculous, there is no rock music in the film (apart from the song played over the end credits) and there are no songs in the film at all - so how is it a musical, you may ask?     A great piece of trash, go on, come over to the dark side!

B000BCKFWK|5.0|Sin City, based on Frank Miller's successful series of comic books of the same name is an intense thrill ride from start to finish. The film was directed by Miller himself as well as Robert Rodriguez, along with Quentin Tarantino, who directed a small segment of the final cut.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is tremendous and includes (among others): Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Mickey Rourke, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer.<br /><br />The stories of the various different characters and the consequences their actions have on their counterparts are ingeniously interweaved to form a narrative that is constantly moving at break neck speed.<br /><br />The story begins with Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a detective of Sin City with one day left from retirement, in pursuit of a sick child killer. The ensuing events are violent, unexpected and exhilerating. After Hartigan's story has been told, Rodriguez and Miller move the action along to Marv, a man determined to find out who killed the girl of his dreams. This leads him to the girls of Old Town, the hookers who work the streets there, enforcing their own laws and looking after themselves. After a series of events leads to a possible war between the police and the prostitutes, action has to be taken by all of the characters to prevent it before it is too late. It is during the second half of the film that all of the characters' connections to one another become clear and the story trundles on towards its shocking conclusion.<br /><br />Usually a film featuring strippers, prostitutes, extreme violence and explosions would be considered \\"bad taste\\" cinema, but Sin City is so beautifully acted, shot and directed that it is an astounding masterpiece. The cast are all on top form and the production values are tremendous. Sin City is a must-see!<br /><br />The DVD extras are excellent, with the second disc featuring the extended director's cut of the film which only adds to the experience, and offer an insight into the creative process behind the film.xperience, and offer an insight into the creative process behind the film.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britney Spears' life has been documented so much this year that it seems surprising that she even needs a new album to maintain her celebrity. However, perhaps she is simply sending the world a message to make them remember why she is famous to begin with. After all, she is one of the most successful female singers of all time, and this album reminds us of this. From the catchy single \\"Gimme More\\" to upcoming single \\"Piece of Me\\" and various other electro-pop tinged songs, this album is a welcome return to form. Fans of Britney Spears will enjoy her comeback and new fans will also like the catchiness of most of the songs and the high production values of the album. The album has input from Pharrell Williams, The Neptunes, T-Pain, Keri Hilson and others and is one of the best albums of the year.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is, without a doubt, one of the most heartwarming films ever made. A painfully shy waitress, Amelie Poulain happens upon a chance discovery that changes her life. She vows to become a \\"regular do-gooder,\\" touching the lives of those around her and, in one hilarious scene, giving the mean-spirited grocer Colignon his just desserts for picking on his slow-witted assistant Lucien. Nonetheless, Amelie remains within the inner world of her rich imagination and seldom ventures out to forge real relationships with others. When she encounters Nino, an unusual young man with whom she feels a natural affinity, she longs for a relationship but can't bring herself to approach him, instead concocting elaborate \\"stratagems\\" to bring them together.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou is absolutely adorable as Amelie, and the artful cinematography, quirky characters, and whimsical story come together in a wonderful film that celebrates the magic of everyday life. Amelie sees the world with a childlike sense of wonder that is thoroughly contagious.<br /><br />The film is full of quirky, idiosyncratic characters, from the neurotic father who spends his days tending to a garden gnome to the Glass Man, a gifted painter who hasn't left his apartment in 20 years. Nino, like Amelie herself, is a dreamer, preoccupying himself with a scrapbook of pictures he sweeps out from under a photo booth. Before that, a co-worker informs Amelie, his pastime was tape recording funny laughs.<br /><br />Amelie is the kind of movie that can be watched dozens of times without losing its magic. It's an infallible antidote to the blues that will warm your heart and bring a smile to your face every time.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way. An excellent, often forgotten masterpiece from the 1970's - a time when the Disney studio made few animations - which features songs such as the title number \\"The Aristocats\\" as well as \\"Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat\\", this will enchant viewers young and old with its enduring jazziness.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I've heard of Micheal Moore but never seen any of his movies until this one.  I had no preconceived notions and an unbiased point of view. By far, this movie was an eye opener. It propelled me to do some of my own research and by the looks of the research, what Moore states checks out.<br /><br />If anything, am I suppose to believe everything the government pumps into mainstream media?  Should I let the government think for me or can I think for myself and make my own decisions?  These are some of the questions that came to mind when I watched this movie.  Seeing first hand the horrendous state of affairs of health organizations, I felt a deep saddening and could relate to many of the individuals in the film.<br /><br />My humble and personal opinion, give this movie a shot.  Go in with an open mind and look for answers for yourself and not from someone else.  This movie is a definite eye opener.  Again, that is my opinion for what it's worth.
B00003CXCW|5.0|She's ready, but are you ready for her? In this magnificent film, Billy Wilder bites the hands that feeds him. Gloria Swanson dazzles as desperate, faded silent movie star Norma Desmond, who is trying to claw her way back to the top after years of seclusion in her Hollywood mansion on Sunset Boulvard. However, her time has been and gone, and at fifty years old, this seems impossible. When Joe Gillis (Holden), an equally desperate screenwriter, happens upon her mansion while fleeing some debt collectors, he finds the perfect way to make some money by using Norma. However, will he be able to escape her wrath when she discovers the truth? After all, in the immortal words of Desmond, \\"No-one ever leaves a star, that's what makes one a star.....\\"

B00006D295|5.0|Telling the story of two all-American kids who are about to get married and their night of terror \\"over at the Frankenstein Place\\". In her first major feature film, Susan Sarandon proves she is a talented comedienne playing Janet, while Tim Curry dazzles as \\"sweet transvestite\\" Doctor Frank N. Furter, a role which he originated on Broadway. While being a worldwide flop on release, it soon started showing in cinemas and art houses at midnight, attracting a huge cult following. It is an excellent satire of old B-movies and is highly entertaining. It contains a brilliant variety of songs, including the most famous: 'The Time Warp', 'Sweet Tranvestite' and 'Science Fiction, Double Feature'. While maybe not appealing to the most conservative of movie-goers, this is pure smut, kinkiness, campness, fun and provides lots of laughs. It will have you humming those songs for weeks, and maybe even have you buying a pair of suspenders and stiletto heels and running off to your local cinema to lap up all the Transylvanian atmosphere. Watch at all costs!
B000RZIGUY|3.0|I love Face Off and i think that this is the best film Nicholas Cage and even John Travlota has been in ( those that say Grease is his best are clearly not the type of people to be watching a John Woo film )     The action is top notch and the movie is well paced with great acting from all cast members... however this edition has one majour problem and that is the fact that they have not removed ANY of the wires used in stunts and it really kills the movie TRUST ME.     I have the one disk edition as well and i must say the 'special' features were nothing 'special'    If you love action movies id probably reccomend this on VHS or even grabbing a DVD copy of 'A fist full of bullets'
0783114893|5.0|The Hitcher is one of the best films ever made and ultimately one of most overlooked as well. The premise of the film is very simple: Jim Halsey is driving a car cross country with plans of dropping it off at his destination when he comes across hitchhiker John Ryder, who seems suspicious from the start. It is incredibly tense and atmospheric and centres around a terrifying performance from Rutger Hauer as John Ryder, a mysterious drifter intent on following C. Thomas Howell's Jim Halsey and making his road trip one that he'll never forget. Most of the film's atmosphere radiates from Hauer as he scares both Howell and the audience with a simple glance which could mean anything and everything. Jennifer Jason Leigh makes an early appearance as a waitress dragged along for the ride after Howell stumbles upon the diner she works at. The performances of the three main actors are involving and it is very easy to feel sympathy for Howell, who has done nothing to deserve the torture he receives at the hands of Hauer, who makes for a terrific villain. A hidden gem and a great cult film, The Hitcher is fantastic.
B000MQC9H4|2.0|Wow, I am surprised at all the positive reviews here.  My husband and I just watched this last night and we were glad when it finally ended.  After some time, my husband checked to see how much longer this would go on and we still had 40 minutes!  That's when I got up and started doing something else.  I agree with another poster that Cameron Diaz was trying too hard.  Despite all the great reviews here, it's not for everyone.  If you like a boring, never ending sappy chick flick, this is for you.
B00005JL96|5.0|Lilo & Stich is such a lovely film! It tells the highly original story of a little Hawaiian girl who is orphaned encountering an experimental creature from outerspace and quickly befriending it. The animation is exquisite and the voice cast are on top form throughout both the comedic and adventurous elements of the story. The music is magnificent and very fitting to the film as most of it is Hawaiian influenced and features Hawaiian singers and instruments. An excellent if often overlooked Disney film that will touch your heart and also leave you with a smile on your face by the end.
B000U0F7RG|4.0|I love the story-line. I feel the 7th season went a little off course from the original plot...I thought it was headed another direction, of corse when you have a theme and a set of characters, I guess the story can only go so far. It was dissappointing to see that the original creators didn't write one episode in the last season, did I miss something? I just felt there could have been more closure to the series. All-in-all a great show to watch with the whole family, or just the girls. The dynamic between mother and daughter is a bond every mother dreams she will have with her daughter. I loved the fantasy inside the reality. Comedy, Drama, a few tears....what more do ya' need? Deffinately worth the money.
B00014NE62|5.0|Maurice, which is based on E.M. Forster's heartbreaking and beautiful semi-autobiographical novel of the same name is a wonderful Merchant Ivory productions.<br /><br />James Wilby stars as Maurice, a young man at Cambridge who begins to develop feelings for his friend and fellow student Clive (Hugh Grant). The feeling turns out to be mutual and the friends soon fall in love with one another, but must keep their relationship secret because of the strict Edwardian society which they inhabit.<br /><br />Clive maintains that the pair should keep their relationship purely \\"platonic\\" which Maurice accepts, despite feeling a need to seal their love physically. When Clive goes on a trip to Greece, he seems to snub Maurice and it soon becomes clear that he has different feelings about their affair.<br /><br />Maurice is understandably heartbroken, but his ordeal is not over there. He soon discovers that Clive is engaged to be married to a woman named Anne. He is devestated. The question is, will he recover from the break-up and find love elsewhere or is he doomed to forever be without love in a society that does not accept people of his kind?<br /><br />The film, which was directed by James Ivory, is a heartbreaking account of one man's struggle to accept his sexuality in a world that tells him that everything about his true inclination is wrong. It also highlights the plight of homosexuals everywhere who were forced to hide their identities because of laws against homosexuality in Britain and around the world.<br /><br />The film is a joy to look at - the cinematography, the art direction and the costume design being a particular highlight - and is very beautiful, capturing the Edwardian period perfectly. James Wilby is excellent as Maurice and Hugh Grant performs well acting against type. Rupert Graves is wonderful in his supporting role as Alec Scudder, who may or may not prove to be Maurice's eventual saviour.<br /><br />The actors inhabit their characters effortlessly and it is easy to feel sympathy for all of them in different ways - Maurice, Clive, Alec and even Anne, for that matter - which creates an emotional journey filled with both highs and lows.<br /><br />An often overlooked and forgotten film, Maurice is brilliant and despite the long running time, should appeal to almost anyone with an open mind, a love of E.M.

B0012SVF3A|5.0|Beautiful movie, one of my top favorites to see!  This had me on an emotional rollercoaster, one minute I'm laughing, the next I'm crying.

B00004RF8J|5.0|This little gem of a musical cannot be recommended more. It stars Rick Moranis as geeky Seymour, a guy whose totally in love with his sweet co-worker Audrey. However, she is in a relationship with an abusive dentist. When a talking plant appears from outer space though, things have got to change for the better, right? An astonishingly original concept - which was actually borrowed from the horror original by Roger Corman, with an early appearance by Jack Nicholson - is brought to life by Frank Oz, director of The Dark Crystal and Bowfinger, also starring Steve Martin. The songs are outstanding and are performed with much gusto by the leading actors, particularly Ellen Greene, who reprises the role of Audrey which she played in the stage version. The film was not a huge success when it was first released, but has rightly established a cult following since then. Long may it continue!
B0002TKFR2|5.0|Heifetz was perhaps the most polarizing artist of the last century. People either love him or hate him. His admirer's note his flawless technique and tonality. His detractor's say his performances sound cold. I happen to rate him (along with Milstein & Oistrakh) right at the top. If you have never heard Heifetz, this is a great place to start. If you are already a Heifetz fan, these recordings will not disappoint and the sound is also great.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|Volver is another masterpiece from filmmaker Pedro Almodovar which stars Penelope Cruz in an Oscar-nominated performance as Raimunda, a hard working Mother living in Madrid with her daughter. Her sister Sole lives nearby and the pair are extremely close. Their simple lives take a supernatural turn, however, when their deceased Mother comes back into the picture. Or is she? An intriguing and heartfelt portrait of the lives of the women from one family that will never be the same again. Everything about this film screams Almodovar and he is still on top form with this, his twenty-ninth film, examining one of his favourite subjects: women. Penelope Cruz shines in a performance that should have bagged her an Academy Award and the ensemble cast were rightly awarded the Best Actress trophy at the Cannes Film Festival. Unforgettable.

B00011RPB0|1.0|No need for a review. Watch it for yourself and be goaded into such extreme boredom that you may choose to hang yourself rather than endure any more.
0316001821|5.0|When i read his review I was thinking either this person is extremely cold in nature or trying to make some sort of haughty english professor review in which only miraculous or super \\"artsy-odd-quirky\\" books that aren't liked by a mass or hardly known of get the 5 stars from him. People that like to come across as being superior in their \\"expert\\" criticisms because they have more education in a field or expose themselves to a large amount of a subject always irk me.      I found myself crying through a huge majority of the book. I can't begin to imagine that this story could be so \\"unconnecting\\" to someone. And no, I don't find myself brought to tears by many stories whatsoever.  I think a lot of people may relate to this book in the way that at one point in their lives they feel similar feelings, and it doesn't have to be spawned by experiencing an actual death. I found that in my life, i've experienced feelings as though i was not very \\"here\\" so-to-speak and just watching the people in my life around me, going on in life living the things that i've wanted to live.  I imagine when people go through rough patches in life, that it's not such an uncommon feeling to metaphorically feel \\"dead\\" and be much more the existing observer of surroundings.  In that way, I feel like the entire human race can really feel in this book and have a deep connection to one or more of these characters. To me, this was an extremely emotional, page-turning grabber; I literally started it around 9am on a Saturday and read through the whole thing finishing about 4am the following morning. It was just so intense, it was impossible to put down. That, to me, is all that needs to be said that a book is amazing. Let this book enrich your viewpoint of life and relationships as so many readers have. It's truly \\"spell-binding\\" for lack of a better, uncliche, term.  ;)  And to think I just stumbled on it by a family member that just dumped me a ton of books to read - what a great find!
B0000060NF|4.0|My father loves Marvin Gaye, so, growing up, I heard a whole lot of him.  Unfortunately, Marvin isn't the kind of artist that most eight or nine year olds like typically, but now that I am a full-fledged adult, I have come to appreciate his creativity and innovation as an artist.  If you listen to enough of his music, it would be evident to you that he pushed the envelope plenty of times throughout his musical tenure.  Racy songs such as \\"Lets Get it On\\" and \\"Sexual Healing\\" and socially conscious numbers like the ones found on \\"What's Going On?\\" such as \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" and \\"What's Going On?\\" all have controversial lyrical content.  I enjoy his voice and delivery more than anything.  He puts just enough soul into his music; never too much, never too little.  He mastered the art of singing in my eyes.  As a unit, this album is satisfying in many ways.  It's not too long, the lyrics are great, and it is simply enjoyable all the way around.  My few gripes are the fact that many of the songs sound alike production-wise and some of the songs are kind of eerie,  perhaps because these songs were so far ahead of their time.  If you were to listen to this album today, you would see how relevant his lyrics are to happenings of today.<br /><br /> This album consists of mostly mid-tempos and ballads, all very touching and emotional.  I have heard \\"What's Going On?\\" numerous times in my life, but today was the first time I listened with my undivided attention.  It's a great song.  The falsetto, hook and lyrics are all stand-outs.  The song is about trying to come up with remedies for social problems.  A lot of artists attempted to ape what Marvin did here by creating a socially-conscious album, but he is one of the few singers who was very effective.  \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" is also a nice song.  Although this album has a strong 70s vibe, it doesn't sound dated.<br /><br /> I highly recommend this album to R&B, soul, neo-soul and pop supporters.  The content here will stick with you long after you have turned the album off.  4 stars.  This one is a classic.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />\\"What's Going On?\\"<br />\\"Save the Children\\"<br />\\"God is Love\\"<br />\\"What's Happening Brother\\"<br />\\"Mercy Mercy Me\\"u have turned the album off.  4 stars.

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Hard to believe it has been fifteen years since this comedy classic was released.  Fortunately GROUNDHOG DAY is standing the test of time and is still one of the funniest films ever made. If you don't know the premise Bill Murray stars as an obnoxious Pittsburgh weatherman who resents almost everything about his job and especially his annual trip to small town Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog Day festival there.  After behaving abominably to his producer(Andie MacDowell), cameraman (Chris Elliot) and all the small town folk there a blizzard comes in and closes all the roads out of Punxsutawney putting Bill in panic stricken sarcasm overdrive.  But the blizzard is the least of his problems.  Bill finds by some magical time loop he has to keep repeating February 2 until he gets it right.  Highly recommended though I will warn you I had the tune to Pennsylvania Polka in my head for several days after watching this.

1419367323|5.0|The idea of Virginia Woolf's fiction being read aloud effectively has struck me as an impossibility.  The very interiority of Woolf's style seemed to suggest that readers hear the narrative voice within themselves.  This reading proves me dead wrong.  Virginia Leishman's reading--and interpretation--added much to my passion for a novel I have always loved.  Readers--and listeners--new to Virigina Woolf need to be able to listen for long stretches of time in order to follow the stream of consciousness that propels the story.  This commitment will be amply rewarded.    I am glad I purchased this.  I will listen to it many, many times.
1400064287|4.0|In his bestselling book, \\"The Tipping Point\\", Malcolm Gladwell identifies three key components which help social phenomena to \\"tip\\", that is to spread from small groups to large groups: involvement of the right people, the right context, and what he referred to as \\"the stickiness factor\\".<br /><br />This book, by brothers Chip and Dan Heath, focuses on traits which make ideas, and ways of communicating ideas, \\"sticky\\" or memorable. Although a good chunk of the book deals with communication within organizations and will be of interest primarily to managers, the book also provides food for thought for teachers, journalists, and anyone with an interest in communicating more effectively with their target audience.<br /><br />According to the authors, a mnemonic for the main qualities of effective communication is SUCCES. Messages stand a better chance of being \\"sticky\\" if they are:<br /><br />Simple<br />Unexpected<br />Concrete<br />Credible<br />Emotional and tell a<br />Story<br /><br />It seems fair to evaluate the authors on the stickiness of their own message, and in general they acquit themselves very well. Abstract ideas in each chapter are well-illustrated using a range of examples, from the persistent appeal of certain urban legends, through specific case studies of both successful and unsuccessful communication strategies.<br /><br />The book is extremely readable, the main points are conveyed clearly, with enough fresh material in the examples to keep the reader's attention. 4.5 stars (because I'm stingy about awarding 5 stars)
B000V6BE6M|5.0|When I walked out of my local cinema on the 17th of December 2003, having just witnessed possibly the best film I have ever seen or ever will see, I was emotionally drained, but also extremely excited to: (a) see the film again on the big screen; and (b) to buy and listen to the soundtrack.    I saw the film one more time, which I believe was enough to both satisfy me and to keep my interest piqued for the soundtrack. It was about a month later when I purchased the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, and never have I been more disappointed.    Film soundtracks somehow always tend to leave out some piece of music that was uniquely memorable to me, however I was horrified to find a good deal of my musical highlights from the film omitted. I understand of course that they have to be ruthless in order to edit a 250-minute score into 70 minutes of CD, but that did not comfort me.    Over time I got used to it, as it appeared to be the only version of the music I was ever going to hear, and I will even admit to loving it: I enjoyed most of the tracks, especially \\"Minas Tirith\\", \\"The White Tree\\", \\"The Black Gate Opens\\" and I still prefer to \\"Anduril\\" to the one presented on the Complete Recordings.    However, it cannot be overstated: The Return of the King - The Complete Recordings is magnificent, everything that I've ever wished for in a musical score and an amazing testament to Howard Shore's skill and genius as an artist. It is what I waited 4 years to hear, and I'm truly glad that I lived to see the day when Shore's 10-hour opera was made available on disc.    I'm not going to make any attempt to critically analyse the music and its various thematic elements, etc. - any attempt would be futile, as that has already been done expertly by Doug Adams, and I would refer anyone interested to know more to the comprehensive Annotated Scores for all 3 Complete Recordings to be found on [...]    Instead, I can only offer an emotional response to what I view to be the highlightsof this monumental recording. First, \\"Roots and Beginnings\\" gives us the music that Shore intended to accompany Smeagol's murder of Deagol and his transformation into Gollum, which was replaced by sound effects in the film: it's extremely powerful music.    \\"The Grace of Undomiel\\" is another favourite of mine as it features the best segue music I have ever heard: as Narsil is re-forged, the Rivendell theme builds to a crescendo before it flows into the Minas Tirith theme, which is appropriate as the film then flashes to Gandalf and Pippin as they approach the capital city of Gondor. The Fellowship theme sounds in an urgent yet heroic statement and then The Realm of Gondor takes over: incredible!    I was always disappointed with \\"The Ride of the Rohirrim\\" on the 2003 Soundtrack as it presented the least stirring of the Rohan melodies when there were 2 other far superior tunes that they could have chosen. \\"The Lighting of the Beacons\\" ends with one of those: the Rohan fanfare is presented as similarly heroic and urgent as Theoden and his troops prepare to depart, before it builds through a majestic version of Nature's Reclamation.    \\"Osgiliath Invaded\\" is another superb track, and it offers us a rare opportunity to hear music that was composed to an earlier, alternate edit of the film. The Morgul-host clash violently with Faramir's rangers before the fellowship theme interrupts the battle: in this version, Gandalf and Pippin have only just arrived in Gondor and, seeing the Nazgul attacking the retreating Gondorians, they charge the Pelennor fields, Gandalf's staff-light blazing, and the Nazgul flee.       The music Shore composed for all of the Paths of the Dead scenes is actually a lot better than I originally thought that it was: the use of hanging Tibetan gongs was a particular stroke of genius on his part: they're just so haunting and exotic! Similarly, Shore's music for the Shelob's Lair sequences not only showcases what is clearly one of his favourite compositional styles, but also reflects the action on screen perfectly, serving as a musical imprint of events.    I suppose that that goes for the entire score, but mention must be made here of his compositions for \\"The Siege of Gondor\\", \\"Grond - The Hammer of the Underworld\\" and \\"The Tomb of the Stewards\\": the music that represents the evil mechanical might of Mordor is evocative and harrowing at the same time.     Perhaps the one piece of music that I have most looked forward to hearing and have found myself humming many times over the last 4 years comes from one of my favourite scenes in the trilogy: Theoden's charge on the fields of the Pelennor. \\"The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\\" on Disc 3 does not disappoint and never ceases to make my hair stand on end as the Hardanger fiddle sings the Rohan fanfare over brave brass doing the same. Fantastic!    The bloody and frantic battle that results from the Rohirrim's arrival is just as well represented musically: from the deep, ponderous percussion of the Mumakil charge to the high, hellish choir that backs the Witch-king's attack on Eowyn, we are presented with a kaleidoscope of melodies that fight for dominance. And yet, amid all the chaos, a clear simple tune calls out during a lull: the Grey Havens theme makes its first appearance in \\"A Far Green Country\\", and what a tune, orchestrated differently from the film, but better!    Finally, Legolas' bringing-down of a Mumak serves as a suitable climax to the battle, both visually and musically, before we fall back to earth where Theoden lies dying. I am in constant awe of Shore's aptness to composing simple yet very emotional music for death scenes: Boromir's in \\"Fellowship\\" was one, and Theoden's is of a similar kind, as choir and halting strings and brass give the impression of a person's breath slowing and finally giving-out.    However, the true climax of the film, and the entire 10-hour score/opera for that matter, is the destruction of the ring. \\"For Frodo\\" sets thoseevents in motion as Aragorn leads the Army of the West against the forces of Mordor and Gollum returns to attack Frodo and Sam on Mount Doom. The incredible choral accompaniment follows these events to perfection as first it sings heroically then its tone turns dark, until it is comforted by the Nature theme.    The Ring is at last destroyed, and the music for \\"The Crack of Doom\\" is some of the best I think that I have ever heard. The Fate of the Ring theme, which once appeared briefly when Aragorn and Gandalf were discussing the future of Middle-earth in The Two Towers, is now brought to the fore by full chorus and orchestra as it represents the downfall of Sauron and hope for a new day. I feel sure that if there is ever a Judgement Day, and Evil is destroyed forever, that music will be playing! The Gondor Reborn theme also features, and it is another example of an alternate version to the film, but a far superior one!    Let me make this clear: the entire 10-hour score/opera is amazing, and is an essential for any discerning music lover. If I had the time to write a review for all three Complete Recordings, I would: this all too brief critique has only looked at a small percentage of the music, and then only my personal highlights. The whole set of 10 CDs may look costly, but I assure you that it is worth every penny, and if you loved the films, the books or just good music, then you will find eternal joy in this score/opera, as I have done and still do.
0321544080|1.0|[[ASIN:0321544080 The Moment It Clicks: Photography secrets from one of the world's top shooters]]      I cannot see the big hype about this book. Joe McNally is a fantastic photographer yes, I agree, but this book is just a biography about his life and career as a photographer and about light.  It's all about the light. If you are a big time lighting fanatic then I would consider purchasing this book. The images he uses in the book are nothing to write home about. I am sure Joe has much more impressive photos he could have shared in his book. Seeing Winona Ryder in her pj's sprawled on a bed as a teenager (at least that what she looked like in the photo) is nothing to write home about. Joe has a story to tell with every single photo in the book. I really did not care about how he rented an elephant for $6000 or a dog for $1000 or even invest some $3400 in some angel wings in order to get \\"the shot\\" How many of us could afford or will actually be in a situation like that? If your pay scale is the same as Joe's, maybe....  I have learned so much more from Scott Kelby books like his digital photography books 1 and 2.  They are technical and actually have a real world use. (No, I do not have any affiliation with Scott Kelby whatsoever. I am just stating a point so anyone who is thinking about buying this book for some really in depth technical knowledge should look somewhere else) How many of us will actually take a ride in a helicopter in this lifetime and snap a photo of an Asian actress dangling from a rope?  Even the pointers Joe provides are nothing more than common sense.  \\"If a strobe blew up and flames starting shooting out of the softbox, stay calm and show your client you have everything under control.\\" Or \\"be persistent, persistence pays\\" Or\\"straight flash is disaster light\\" This review is just to express my disappointment as I expected much more from one of the world's top photographers.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|I love my trilogy and it couldn't be any better than on HD. It stinks that it looks as though Blu-Ray is going to win out.
0439813786|5.0|This was a wonderful book. My son (7) and I loved it. The way the pictures tell a part of the story is a really exciting new way to read a book like this!
B00008RWB3|5.0|I am determined to write a short review of a very long book. And quickly. I started reading \\"IJ\\" the year it first came out and finished it 5 years later. That's OK. It's like reading Melville's \\"Moby Dick,\\" Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" or Pychon's Gravity's Rainbow.\\"  If you are a serious contemporary/postmodern/whatever reader or writer you must read it. Whatever time it takes. Homework. Don't skip the footnotes. You will not regret it. You'll laugh/cry/it will become you/etc. Infinite Jest is the book I recommend when I am talking to people who REALLY READ BOOKS.   Working backwards, I now turn to \\"Don Quixote.\\" Bon voyage!
B000683VI4|5.0|I didn't see this film when it first came out because I was told, \\"It's depressing\\"...and it sounded like a \\"downer\\" having to do with dementia and losing one's memory.  But, I saw this film over the weekend on DVD 3 years later.  It's a fine film!!!  It's not depressing at all!!!  If you have any heart at all, you'll love the film...as I did.  Recommended.  boland7214@aol
630522577X|5.0|This is such a wonderful film - never fails to delight me whenever I watch it, especially Rex Harrison's abrasive, woman-hating professor.  What a delicious character!  Hepburn is yummy too.  I got the 2-disc edition and have enjoyed it thoroughly.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|You won't regret watching or purchasing this film about the life of Beatrix Potter.  It was tastefully portrayed and enjoyable to watch.  It wasn't so much of a sappy sweet chick-flick that my husband regretted watching it.  He liked it also.  We both recommend this film!
B00005JPUN|3.0|I'm a big fan of the first two \\"Body Snatcher\\" films - the first is classic sci-fi camp: see it in a theater with a bunch of cheerfully heckling MST3K pop-culture geeks. It's so funny! On the other hand, the 1978 remake is hella scary.  And this version... well... I gave it a chance because some reviewers (here) eloquently came to its defense, and I figured, what the heck. And, yeah, it's not a total stinker, but it could have been much more electrifying and tense - it does have a bit of a by-the-numbers feel to it. Plus, the ending is too quick and too clean, also a disappointment. This is an okay horror thriller, and it is in the classic tradition, but it should have been better. 3 stars, or 3.5 would seem about right. (Slipcue film reviews)
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Lonesome Dove is one of the greatest all time movies.  Even if you are not a big fan of westerns this one has something for everyone.  Great cast!!!  It is long but it keeps your attention the whole time.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|Well done. Although the story itself does not tug at my heartstrings as much as Jane Austen's others, my daughters and I did enjoy watching this version of Northanger Abbey. It is much better and more accessible than the older version. The two leads are well cast. My 13-year-old daughter has already watched this several times. She finds it especially appealing of all of the ITV versions that have aired recently on PBS.    My only disappointment is that I wish the scenes that had been deleted from the British version had been restored for this DVD. I know I saw at least one scene in the preview that was not included in this DVD.
0060922583|5.0|This is actually a life changing event.  And you don't actually need to believe it for it to have an effect.  Moreso, just consider it in your daily life.  It helps put things into perspective and reminds you that there are more possibilities than you had previously thought.  The seller sent it quickly and I couldn't argue with the price.  Perfect!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I ordered this right after seeing it on PBS. I have the old version too (starring Amanda Root), and I think they are both wonderful in their own way. I have read the book as well. I really like the main actor and actress in this version. He is very handsome and his long, sad glances at Anne are enough to make you ache for him. My favorite scene was when he first sees her in Bath and tells her: \\" ... He ought not. He does not.\\" Perfect.    Sally Hawkins is wonderful, and - unlike some of the other reviewers - I thought she was very attractive. Perfect for the Anne Elliott character, her beauty was subtle and grew on you with time. Her inner beauty (sweetness, character) made her more outwardly beautiful as the story progressed. I was very moved by the scenes in which she was writing in her journal and looking directly at the audience, so I don't understand why some people have disliked that so much. It worked for me! I especially liked the scene when she is anticipating the dinner with the Crofts. Her spoken journal entry is very poetic, moving and helps the viewer to understand what she is thinking and feeling.    I also disagree with the reviewers who said she was whiny or that she just ran to her room and cried all of the time. Not true! Her strong, capable character is revealed in so many ways throughout the movie: She took care of her father's house. She saved them from being in even worse financial trouble. She took care of her sister, even though Mary was very annoying and not really sick. She took care of her nephew when his own mother didn't want to be troubled. She was a favorite of the Musgroves and of the Crofts and of Lady Russell. She was loyal to her old poor schoolfriend, even when her family disapproved. Her father's solicitor said she was the only daughter with any sense. She took care of Louisa after the fall. She graciously leaves when Mary insults her. etc. etc.    I have watched this version several times. I wish the ending weren't so rushed andI wish the kissing scene in Bath was more flattering for the actress, but I admire the way the director was able to edit the movie down to such a short duration but still include all of the essentials to tell a very moving story. Well done.
B000P2A256|4.0|It Won't Be Soon Before Long is indeed a great album. I like the new influences on this album. I can call this an 80's retro CD because there are influences of the 80's Pop and New Wave acts, 80's Hall and Oates, Michael Jackson's Off The Wall-Thriller-Bad, Kool and the Gang's 1984 Emergency album, and 80's Prince. This is not a boy band or a girl pop sounding band because everyone plays a real instrument. Their first was neo-soul sounding but this was 80's Prince/Hall and Oates sounding. I like this one so much!!
0679809015|5.0|My daughter picked this out recently for her 10 month birthday, over bigger, flashier books, and it is still one of her faves weeks later. She had just learned how to lift the flaps on her Spot book, but she prefers this one. I thought it looked kinda \\"made in china\\", small with retro / low budget illustrations compared to the other baby board books, but what can I say. It makes her very happy, and that's all that matters. If there were more in this series, I'd buy them all! -A happy mom and happy baby.
0765357151|1.0|Rather than repeat the good reviews on the story of \\"I am Legend\\" I am offering a review of the book itself.  I am disappointed in the marketing ploy of this book, relying on the movie to sell the book.  Nowhere on the cover, the back of the book or the inside flap does it state this is a compilation of short stories.  It instead relies on the reader's interest in the movie with Will Smith to sell the book.  In fact, the story itself used to sell the book is only 159 pages of the 312 page book.  There are in fact 11 stories in this book.  Not all of them great reads.  I probably would have bought it anyway but I resent the obvious deception that this entire book was a novel of the one story, \\"I am Legend\\" and was hoping for much more.  The story itself was good and well written.  I will wait until the DVD is released to see the movie.  I won't buy books again from TOR without researching further to find the truth about their packaging and what is actually inside.
044661758X|4.0|This is the third of Mr Connelly's novels to feature LA Police Detective Harry Bosch.  In this novel, Harry is on trial in a civil case for the fatal shooting of an alleged serial killer known as the Doll Maker.  Just as the trial begins, a new murder victim is discovered and there appear to be links to the murders committed by the Doll Maker.  Harry is both simultaneously involved in court and in solving this new murder mystery: time is critical.<br /><br />Michael Connelly is an accomplished writer of crime novels who knows how to bring his characters to life.  His previous employment as a crime reporter has no doubt provided him with insights into the operations of the LAPD.  At the same time as we are travelling with Harry to solve this new murder and the mystery of the Doll Maker, we are learning more about Harry himself.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel, and look forward to continuing to read about Harry Bosch.  Now, what's the name of the next one in the series?<br /><br />Highly recommended for crime fiction fans.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I don't know who the guy is that wrote the editorial review for this album, but he is definitely out to lunch...     I never heard of this band, but I saw the album in my local record store and was intrigued by the cover art. When I arrived home, I immediately went to Amazon.com and listened to some snippets of the songs. They sounded good, but it's hard to get a feel for an entire album just by listening to 30 second clips. So I went ahead and bought the album.    I gave it a once-through. Then a second-through. Then a third-through... I've been listening to this album for about 5 days in a row now and it just gets better every time. The editorial reviewer complained about the variety on the album, but I believe that's one of the strengths. There's definitely something for everyone in this album.    I listen to a lot of indie-rock and this is definitely one of the top albums that has come out in the last few years. I rank it up there with Boxer by The National, Neon Bible by the Arcade Fire, and 23 by Blonde Redhead to name a few. Suffice it to say that this album is definitely in good company.    Now I know this album was released on Columbia, which means it's not necessarily \\"Indie\\"... But it was definitely crafted with the indie crowd in mind. It succeeds on many levels and it does so with flying colors.
B00004LN16|4.0|This album is more laid back than any of their material since the '80's, with somewhat rawer production and without the more obvious \\"arena anthem\\" type songwriting we saw on The Razor's Edge.  Consequently, the album eases into a solid mid-intensity groove and pretty much sticks with it until the end.  Personally, I find it a really nice listen.  But others might conclude that the band is playing it safe and that some of the fire is gone.  It's a thin line, usually, between laid back and boring.    Once again, the Young brothers write all of the material, including the lyrics.  While I always prefer it when Johnson writes his own lyrics, I think the Youngs do a better job on Still Upper Lip than on Ballbreaker or The Razor's Edge.  The double entendres are less forced and the subject matter is less weird.  It's great to hear Phil Rudd on this record.  His drum playing is straight down the middle and no frills, but nobody brings more feel to a straight hard rock four-four beat than Phil Rudd does.    In summary, this should not be one of your first AC/DC albums.  However, if you have most of their catalog, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  The band has nothing left to prove to anybody.  However, with this album they show they still rock.
B000YA82F6|5.0|the 'baby' is called an 'It' because \\"IT\\" is an IT...it is a girl or it is a boy...over sensitivity to 'itness' is just that, hyper sensitivity to insignificance...'i am it, you are it, and so is that, he is it, she is it, and that is that'...anyhoo, this film is delightful entertainment, great acting, compassionate 'message', an everyday experience in many lives in most any high school in America...examples of wit, smart and loving parents and mature relationships and responsibility in play all across the board...another amazing example you don't have to spend a fortune to get a fantastic movie like 'Juno', 'Knocked Up', 'Little Miss Sunshine', '40 Year Old Virgin' and 'Superbad' ... lovely film.

B0011HOEY4|4.0|I had been itching to see this movie from when I first saw the posters & trailers. It was a long wait, but I am glad I did see it. As many others have acknowledged, the acting was superb. Denzel & Russell provide tour-de-force performances, which of course is at its sweetest when they are together in a scene. Denzel gives a beautifully layered performance, showing the charm & attractiveness of the man, but then being able to turn on a dime into a ruthless monster. However, even when he is being ruthless, that is underpinned by the man's own sense of right & wrong, and you can understand why he does what he does, even though you don't agree with it or support it. I was able to empathize with where he came from and his family values, while also seeing his story as an example of how we reap what we sow in life.<br /><br />Josh Brolin was a real plus to this movie, playing a dirty detective. I am amazed at his versatility, and I am delighted to see his career taking off the way it is. This is a quality role and he is perfect in it.<br /><br />American Gangster is an interesting expose on a real-life person, and gives a good feel to the life & times of this person. It didn't grab & awe me the way The Departed did (I still can't get that movie out of my mind, I loved it so much), I think the story wasn't as strong, and it didn't have the heart & heart-pounding action that The Departed did. Where The Departed was masterful, American Gangster was very good. Overall, it is a movie that I found interesting & it keep me glued to my seat & I left the theatre feeling that I had a satisfying, quality movie experience.<br /><br />Rai Aren
B00103584Y|5.0|The cool premise is of a single event replayed multiple times with only slight differences in timing yet very different outcomes. The extra reward is the viewer gets to see the ripple effects of how that difference in timing affects all the future life events of everyone who comes into contact with Lola for the briefest of moments or who already has a past connection to her.     I rented this DVD 8 or 9 years ago and enjoyed it so much that I immediately watched it again, then without a brake I watched it a third with the director/star commentary on. Each time I picked up more engaging details and and it progressively increased my enjoyment even more. For a lower budget film I thought it was very clever, extremely well executed and Franka P. gave an amazing performance - her first to be shown widely to an American audience and with a star-quality performance that set her up for a future role in the 2 Bourne movies.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|My family & I saw this movie together and what a delight it was! I was pretty sure it would be really funny because of Jerry Seinfeld and we were not disappointed. The movie was everything you want a family movie to be - it has heart, lots of laughs, some very tender, moving moments, and some underlying messages. The ending of the movie actually surprised me a little with a clever examination of our own daily lives & the meaning therein.<br /><br />One of the things that I particularly loved about this movie is its compassion for non-human life. It demonstrated, brilliantly, the complex & meaningful lives that non-humans (in this case bees) live, the contributions they make, which benefit all of us, and showed how interconnected we all truly are. The movie showed a person (wonderfully voiced by Renee Zellweger) treating the bee with respect, consideration and compassion and trying to teach others to do the same. Our world needs lots more of that, so I hope that movies such as this one work to get that message across and into the 'real' world, and I'm sure that they do... :)<br /><br />Overall, this movie is an interesting & thought-provoking take on the life of the bees, which in many ways, can mirror our own lives, the decisions, the struggles, the highs, the disappointments, and most of all trying to figure out who we really are inside, what we are doing here, what roles we have to play & how it affects those around us...<br /><br />Rai Aren
0891419195|5.0|It took me over fifteen years to read this book.  During my sophomore year in college \\"With the Old Breed\\" was listed as required reading in my modern US history course.  As I remember it, the \\"Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie\\" was also required, and when I read that cover-to-cover only to discover that just one question on the mid-term addressed that book, I decided to blow off reading the memoir of WWII Marine private Eugene Sledge.  In hindsight, I'm glad I did.  The guilt of having not read the book (not to mention my shock and consternation to find many questions about the memoir on the final) kept it on my bookshelf and a volume that I resolved to read eventually.<br /><br />Thus, I had the opportunity to read this unforgettable story in my mid-30s, with all of the \\"wisdom\\" had I gained in the intervening decade-and-a-half, and in the midst of another American war, rather than as a naïve 19-year-old in the fat-and-happy post-Cold War years.<br /><br />Simply put, this memoir is mesmerizing.  In the introduction to the paperback volume by the incomparable Paul Fussell, Sledge's writing is described as so honest, so unadorned that it allows the reader to peer into the horrors of modern combat like looking through a pane of glass.  Fussell is absolutely correct.<br /><br />What makes this memoir so powerful and unique is the mixed perspective that Sledge brings to his experience in Company K, 3rd Battalion, 5th Regiment, 1st Marine Division in the Pacific Theater in 1945.  On the one hand, Sledge is undeniably anti-war.  The experience of combat described by Sledge is horrifying and an utter waste.  Never once does Sledge contend that the Marines are engaged in a necessary and just war against an Imperial Japan that attacked his country and committed unspeakable atrocities against fellow Americans, as well as innumerable others.  His commentary is reminiscent of Jonathan Shay's \\"Achilles in Vietnam,\\" a brilliant and original take on the effects of close order combat.  Sledge and his fellow Marines in the Pacific could care less about the surrender of Nazi Germany or the death of Franklin Roosevelt in the spring of 1945.  All that matters is Company K and what their next assignment will be.  The most critical question on their minds is whether or not to drop their gear when given a break on a forced march or keep it on in the event that the break is cut short.<br /><br />On the other hand, for all of the terror and waste of combat, Sledge is clearly a proud Marine, a man who in the twilight of his life still signs his letters \\"Semper Fi.\\"  He praises his drill instructor for the hardships he was forced to endure as, he claims, it saved his life when he was confronted with the nightmare of modern war on Pelileu and Okinawa.  Sledge's descriptions of his experiences in the Pacific, especially in Okinawa, are unsettling.  The putrid smell of rotting flesh, the constant rain, lack of sleep, maggots and flies in the millions, Japanese shelling and nighttime infiltrations, psychiatric breakdowns of fellow Marines, it reads like an additional level of Dante's Inferno.<br /><br />The penultimate paragraph of the memoir sums up the themes best:<br /><br />\\"War is brutish, inglorious, and a terrible waste.  Combat leaves an indelible mark on those who are forced to endure it.  The only redeeming factors were my comrades' incredible bravery and their devotion to each other.  Marine Corps training taught us to kill efficiently and to try to survive.  But it also taught us loyalty to each other - and love.  That esprit de corps sustained us.\\"<br /><br />God bless the United States Marine Corps.ellow Marines in the Pacific could care less about the surrender of Nazi Germany or the death of Franklin Roosevelt in the spring of 1945.

0143038419|1.0|This was picked as a book club book, the library owns no copies, so I had to buy it.  I am half way through (book club meeting was last week) and I doubt I'll even bother to pick it back up.  This woman is too whiny and I just want to smack her one good time!  She keeps going off on tangents and can't keep on track.  Waste of money in my opinion.  Would never buy another one of her books!
B000WTZ784|3.0|I liked this album when it was originally released. It was dark and moody but sounded fresh and Ray Wilson has a great voice to fit the band. I was pumped to see all the remasters for Genesis but upon a closer look the band really disses this re-release.  There were so many extra songs recorded that were used as b-sides to the singles released (i.e Congo,  Shipwrecked, etc.) why not include them on this release as a 2nd cd?  Also the live footage is great but c'mon! only 3 songs!!, the band had a complete show filmed in Poland waiting to be released if the album was a huge success, but as you can guess it wasn't. Oh well, I really felt the band purposely overlooked this album when it came time to remaster...they could have included all the Wilson era songs plus the concert into a nice comprehensive package that the diehard Genesis fans have wanted of this album.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is a simple and fun game. It is very easy to learn(only takes a few minutes), but I would say that it takes quite a long time to master. It is great game for children to improve logical skills as well. Easly one of the best board games on the market today. If you are unsure about the game go to Blokus.com and try the online version for free. Gotta go, time to play another game with the kids.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars is one of the only television shows my mother and I have ever agreed on.  We have extremely different taste in pop entertainment, but from the first episode this awesome program drew us both in and kept us interested.  The writing is excellent, the cast consistently knocks it out of the park, and the continuity and production are fantastic.  The second and third seasons are good as well, but the first season will always be my favorite, not least for giving me something innocuous and current to talk about with my mother every week.
0060887966|5.0|I heard The Alchemist on CD first and like it so much I wanted a hard copy. The gift edition was even better than I expected, and not just another hard copy book.
0440234743|3.0|I've read many Grisham novels and The Testament was not his best.  However, it was still a pretty entertaining read.<br /><br />While the premise sounded promising- a billionaire dies while his family fights over the money he left behind...we're thrown into a story where a lawyer travels to the remotest areas of Brazil in order to find a long lost daughter.  Still sounded interesting, however it sort of played out a little less than exciting.  At points it sort of dragged.  But towards the end it did pick up again.<br /><br />Overall it was ok, not my favorite of his.  But, I did enjoy the story and the moral Grisham was trying to convey.  Good ending too.
0439882826|5.0|This book is a masterpiece.  The workmanship that went into this thing is amazing.  I also recommend buying two copies, one to save, and one to use.  I think it's inevitable that one will get used and abused, and eventually broken, because it will be looked at so often.  It's just that cool.
009917961X|5.0|This is a can't-miss Grisham!  This is one of his best books.  Classic.<br /><br />Who doesn't love a thriller with an underdog chasing the greedy and corrupt insurance company, to make them pay for cheating their customers?  Especially one that is so dirty that they would rather lose a life than to pay out benefits.  Great characters, story and ending.  It was fast-paced but thorough in the story and development.  Loved it!!
B000002ADT|5.0|Very happy that this album was reissued on CD.  Ever since I first heard it, as a teen (eons ago), it has been part of my life.  This unique contribution to jazz stil says something very special.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Thank God for Megadeth! I thought that thrash metal was dying. This album is a breath of fresh air in a slower, tamer rock world. I particularly loved \\"Amerikhastan\\", where Dave throws in a little bit about his views on the war with some serious shred behind it. \\"Sleepwalker\\" has some of the best guitar that's come out in a while. \\"Gears of War\\" was SICK! It's about time that I bought an album that I can listen to all the way through. I won't commit sacrilidge and say that this is the BEST album, but I put it up there with \\"Countdown\\" and \\"Rust\\".
B000R7HY0K|1.0|It pains me to say this, but Mr Tarantino owes me six quid and nearly two hours of my life, which I know I won't get back. What on Earth was he thinking? Rambling dialogue is ok when it's entertaining, but when it's utter drivel it's awful. The warning light came on two minutes from the start. I really do like Tarantino's work, but this is pushing the loyalty of even the most unquestioning fan. I'll bet Kurt Russell was stoked to think he'd be in a hardcore hit, but I wonder what he thought when he saw the final cut? I should have hit the fire alarm button and claimed my cash back. All you need to know are the words suspicious/tedious/wasted/ rushed and embarrassing. Sorry, my friends, it's a stinker no matter how much you dissect it. And it DOES pain me to say that.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Baby Cromwell
0380799006|5.0|This book sure helped me survive being a parent!  It helped so much that the book was written in a way that I could pick it up, read quickly for the few uninterrupted minutes I could actually get, and then put it down.  The cartoons were great- there were some that I copied and hung up around the house as reminders to myself, for the habits that I wanted to form.  This book especially helped me learn when to step into sibling disputes, and when to let them work it out.  Now that my children are pretty much grown, I'd have to say that this book was probably the most helpful in raising them.  They get along quite well!
B000001ELD|3.0|Buy this just to hear Donna Summer back up Gene Simmons.  Donna Summer is pure rock and roll here.  She belts like she does on \\"Hot Stuff\\" and \\"Cold Love\\".
B0010ZR160|5.0|Instants after I left the hall of projection yesterday afternoon, came to my mind the famous Sixth commandment \\"You won't steal\\" of the celebrated Decalogue of Kieslowski, because what we have in this intriguing and superbly well elaborated movie is an ethic dilemma between what it must be done to preserve the integrity of child whose mother is far beyond of what we might label as an exceptional mother.<br /><br />Amanda is the kidnapped girl that constitutes the dramatic nucleus of the first part of the film. But beware, nothing is like it seems in that nocturnal ambush. The web of conflicts and dark interests nestled will allow  to elaborate an Arian's thread that will lead us to an unexpected finale.<br /><br />There are several highlights in this brilliant movie; first at all, I have to remark the agile direction of Ben Affleck and fabulous edition work; the memorable performance of Ed Harris as the Machiavellian officer, who really embodies what many officers think in low voice about the punishment against the criminal who attempts to beat or abuse a child, although this ethic statement be blurred by another actions that you will see all along this outstanding movie that unexplainable reasons was overlooked by critics and members of the Jury the last year. Perhaps, the recent Award to \\"Mystic river\\" could have influenced in this decision, but the certain of the case is we are before a first order work that must be seen.<br /><br />Recommended without hesitation.
B000TCEU4Q|3.0|The product as a whole, is well worth the price, and works well for my setup, if you fly jets this is a must, order two for jets, 747s rule.   Gave it 3 stars not for the product but for amazon, they took awhile to process the order, then they used USPS as shipping which took longer, they need to go back to UPS they are alot better, than snail mail. And something happen to there order processing used to take a day and a half to process, now it takes 4 days  plus shipping equels two weeks for delivery, thats not good at all.
B000BCE918|4.0|I had seen the Jurassic Park movies previously on VHS, the DVD is much better sound and picture- worth purchasing in DVD. I purchased the set to watch with my Grandsons. I enjoyed them all over again and my grandsons want to watch them everytime they come to visit. For adults, some of the parts are are too \\"kidized\\" but if you want to watch them with younger children the \\"kid\\" element works out ok. We all enjoyed watching the entire set.
0060557818|2.0|Having read Stardust, which I liked (although which is one of the very rare books that is not as good as the movie, IMHO), I was disappointed in Neverwhere (which I listened to on audiobook). It's like a very ugly Wizard of Oz (which the author at least cops to in the end), where instead of Dorothy we get befuddled Richard, who seems to have no strong feelings about anything except that he wants to go home.  And, he's not exactly passionate about that; just sort of bemusedly tagging along after the girl Door and her entourage as she seeks vengeance for the murder of her family. The story is confusing, the bad guys disgusting as well as sadistically violent, and everything in Under London is dirty, uncharming and like some 70's movie version of a bad drug trip. Definitely not Oz, and definitely not for young children. When Richard finally gets home, he's not happy with everything he ever wanted, so he decides to go back to Under London.  Why?  I have no idea.  He seems very likely to end up dead there, as it's a dangerous place and he's clueless. Then again, I found myself clueless as well, and wondering about the motivations of all the characters. The plot is a jumble. [And why does the marquis share a name with the character from Puss n Boots?] The concept of another world under London and in abandoned tube stations was interesting, the story is just not executed well.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|The ppl selling the cd got the cd to me quickly.  It's a good quality cd.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink is a various artist. She can do it all. R&B, pop and rock. This CD is a good mixture of all three. My favorite track is the duet she does with Steven Tyler from Aerosmith \\"Misery\\". It has a bluesy feel to it. The perfect song to listen to when you fell kind of down and don't want to be cheered up at the moment.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|This series could be great.  However, the characters have no chemistry between each other.  The only char that can act is Gwens boyfriend.  Gwen needs to get that gap between her teeth fixed.   I know I gave this a 5 star and yet I am ripping the characters.  Well what can I say.  I love SciFi and I love Dr. Who and I love Torchwood.  However, the show needs to pick up more and the characters need to get some chemistry.  It may be the highest rated SciFi on the BBC but I believe it is becuaseit was from the Dr. Who name.  Also, the women need to be hotter and though Jack is Gay (yes Gay) not Bi because if he was he would be going after women as much as men and so far that has not happened.  So everyone just shut up.    Well I hope this show stays for years so peopel buy the DVD's. Watch the show and pray that they get some chemistry.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|For those who like Postal Service, you will like this CD. Probably becuase it is the same singer. Still, you will like either way. The jewel for me on this CD is \\"Into The Dark\\". The opening lyric is \\"Love of my/Someday you will die...\\" Sounds kind of dark and sad but it is truly a beautiful song. Makes me cry just listening to it. My husband sung this to me on our wedding day. It was perfect!
B0012NVGHU|5.0|Once is a simple, lovely movie set in Dublin that soars thanks to the outstanding music. Being an Irish film, it isn't your typical guy meets girl movie - therein the charm. The film literally sings of love, confusion and hope.  Since watching the film I can't get E. M. Forster's words \\"Only connect...\\" out of my head.    After watching the film you will probably want to find more of the amazing music by The Frames and Glen Hansard - you know where to find it. There is an excellent interview/live set available online with Glen Hansard and The Frames which was done by the incomparable David Dye at WXPN's World Cafe Live in Philly last May.
B0009MAO46|5.0|A wonderful film for my 2-1/2 year old grandson who has watched this at least 30 times. This is his favorite dvd.  He also has the Buzz and Woody dolls, and constantly play acts with them.  Even deepening his voice to do so.  Very, very cute. I too love this. So do his parents.  His parents, I think have seen it more than my grandson.  They practically know the dvd verbatim.  Don't miss this.  This will probably be your favorite children's dvd also.
0525950079|5.0|Having read and loved the author's epic saga, \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", a novel about the building of a cathedral in the town of Kingsbridge in twelfth century England, I very much looked forward to reading this book. I was not disappointed. This is a masterful saga of life in fourteenth century England, and the author weaves a rich and colorful tapestry of people, places, and events in the medieval town of Kingsbridge, where a magnificent cathedral now stands.<br /><br />There are a number of rich and colorful characters that drive the story, and the age old battle between good and evil plays itself out through them. Spanning a period of thirty-four turbulent years, this is a spellbinding story of love, hate, betrayal, revenge, and triumph. Moreover, the Black Plague has reared its ugly head, and England will never be the same. New ideas are germinating on the horizon, coming into conflict with the settled way of doing things, and the town and people of Kingsbridge are in a state of flux.<br /><br />Although the novel is a lengthy one, the reader will be unable to put the book down, so engaging and absorbing is the story.  Those who are partial to the historical fiction genre will very much enjoy this book.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel(Sin City was also adapted to the big screen a few years ago),\\"300\\" is a movie about glory,war and courage.This movie is more than your regular movie,it was done in such a beautifull and strong artistic way that you can't help but just be stunned by it.This is one of the most visually stunning experiences and it goes further than anything you've seen before.I admit that's saying quite a lot,but that's the truth.\\"300\\" tells the story of the Spartan people and the thirst for defending their country.King Leonidas guided 300 Spartans to a march to glory.The Spartans had no other hope than to \\"die beautifully for their country\\" and fight until death would take them.There was only 300 Spartan and over a thousand Persians and there wasn't much hope,but they gave the Persians a great fight.While it isn't historically accurate and was never meant to be,300 remains impressive in its own right.<br /><br />300 doesn't have much of a story,it has one but it is quite simple : 300 Spartans making their last stand fighting for their land.I'm sure you've heard that a lot by now.It is an epic story about the ancient Grece and it makes a great hommage to the Spartan people.It shows how strong the Spartans were but also how only the strong ones were allowed to fight.In fact the babies were looked carefully for weaknesses,and if they had any they would kill them and only the strongest survived.Those who were kept alive were trained vigorously to fight and to not feel pain.They were and still are often talked about as \\"barbarians\\" and ignorants.I don't think 300 could have been done much better from a visual perspective,the novel was amazing and the movie is even more and done near flawlessly.From the first to the last scene this movie is a complete chef d'oeuvre(big words never hurt!).This is by far one of the purest movie today,not designed to give any judgements and it doesn't try to make you have an opinion,neither was it intended to be a box-office hit(well I say that but we never know)it's just amazing.<br /><br />King Leonidas(Gerald Butler is impressive and gives a truthfull and honnest performance of the character that can only impress you)chooses 3000 hundred Spartans to go to war and conquer the Perse territory make the glorious name of the Spartan a famous and respected one.With his army he will try to take the Persian people and their god Xerxes by surprise,wich failed.Yes there are more Persians and statistically the Spartans shall loose,but they won't until they have given all they've got and killed the last Persian.Its a true story of dedication and hope,the warrior code the Spartans had is respected in its entirety here even making us wonder if it really is true as it seems like too much.Historians will know right from the start that this ain't accurate history but will still love it for all the historical references and how they manage to make a great movie related to history.It is also interresting to see the power that the queens had and how they were respected,most of what you see in movies are slave females so it is nice to see one who has power.Troughout all of it,there is also love,friendship and betrayal of their country wich adds a more human touch.<br /><br />The Spartans seem not like average humans,but rather like gods in this film.Expect to see plenty of abbs and muscles in this movie as they fight bare-chest so you do have to see that quite often.The acting in the movie is quite convincing and is nothing to complain about,every actor does a great job here.The movie is mostly focused on visuals and the amazing battles it had rather than actual script.The battles are outstanding and very well executed with lots of action in them.Every battle is stunning and seems yet so realistic for a movie.That is one great thing about 300,it looks very real.Those fights seems to have a certain rythym alternating between fast and slow and at times slow motion to give some of the desired effects.There doesn't seem to be lots of computer effects but there are some,I'm just glad there isn't too much of it to the point that all it does is rely on those effects.There is more than one battle and many characters die,also there is a lot of violence and blood so now you know that not anyone can watch this.The final comfrontation and the ending remains touching and made the Spartans look proud of what they have achieved.<br /><br />To conclude,how can you not like this movie?You can but you can't deny that its is a piece of art and a fine masterpiece.There is something to like about it for everyone wheter it's the fight scenes,the impressive artistic result or the overral story.It reminds me a lot of the \\"The Gladiator\\" wich was similiar to 300 in some ways,but this is much more impressive.You have to admire the overral perspective and direction of 300.This 2-discs special edition also has plenty of extras,one disc full of them,many extras and some that are great to watch.You get your money's worth wether you buy this two discs special edition,single disc,widescreen,full screen : it's all good!Some videos on Youtube make fun of 300(this is sparta another techno remix is hilarious),but there is a movie called \\"meet the spartans\\" that makes fun of this as well.People may make fun of this but it remains gold.It follows a lot from the 1961 movie \\"The 300 Spartans\\" and it is interresting to compare with 300.A well-deserved five stars!lots of computer effects but there are

B000UBMSB8|5.0|Watched all versions and still liked original release best. Worth it though last movie to use minitures instead of cgi and blue screen. DEL
0978607651|5.0|The art work is splendid and well reproduced.  It is oversized, which is the problem -- the binding will not hold up.  The book needs to be opened on a flat surface and browsed that way;  it won't last long if someone tries to hold it while reading it.
B000ZK4466|4.0|I've been disappointed with everything this band has done since \\"Deloused\\".  It seemed like they were trying to hard to sound avant-garde with long song structures that really went nowhere.<br /><br />Having heard this new album, I'm back on the Volta bandwagon. This album is full of the stylings I craved for so long, sweet guitar, hard driving bass and drums, and rocking songs that I can actually listen to without getting bored.
B00000K31Q|4.0|The 80s were a big time for the teen genre; it seemed like almost every week there was a new teen movie opening, but with the end of the 80s and the end of the John Hughes era seemed to be the end of the teen genre. While there were still some teen movies produced in the 90s they didn't seem to get over as well. But towards the late 90s with the success of the TV series Dawson's Creek and the American Pie franchise suddenly the teen genre was back in a big way. What followed were mostly lackluster movie, but 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the better ones to follow.<br /><br />Clich&eacute;s are a very odd thing; sometimes they can do a movie in due to how predictable it is where as other times they help make the movie enjoyable. 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the movies where the clich&eacute;s actually help and make the movie a lot of fun. We've seen movies like this done back in the 80s and overall done better, but there is just something about this movie that works really well and it comes out very enjoyable.<br /><br />I have no problem with sexuality in movies it's a shame in these PC days everyone seems to complain, but it's kind of nice not having any of that. At first the sexual gags are fun, but then other filmmakers see that and try and up the ante and it's no longer fun. It becomes doing these gags for the sake of it. 10 Things I Hate About You goes back and does things more simple and simply just aims to make you laugh and entertain you and it very much gets the job done.<br /><br />The screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith was very well written with excellent and characters with plenty of depth; all the usual type characters are here; the jock, the pretty popular girl, the guy in love with the popular girl, the outcast and the bad boy. With all of that one would think this movie would probably fail, but to the credit of the writers they take the basic teen movie formula and work it well and write a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />Director Gil Junger pretty much delivers the text book teen movie direction and like the writing instead of hurting it really works well despite any clich&eacute;s. When doing a teen flick there are often silly and over the top moments; sometimes they work and sometimes they fell flat. But here the over the top moments are well done and believable.<br /><br />10 Things I Hate About You in my opinion is a much better movie than one might think. The movie has a lot of heart and a great message of just be yourself. This is the type of movie that is a great pick up if you are feeling down. At least for me it works like that and entertains me for 90-minutes and puts a smile on my face and despite any flaws that is all that matters. How the movie ends shouldn't come as much of a shocker to the audience. I think it's safe to know from the very start once the plot kicks in how this will all turn out. But again despite all this 10 Things really works so well and is one of the better teen flicks of the 90s and quite honestly would make my top 10 teen comedies, I really enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would.<br /><br />I'm not gonna jump on the let's all praise Heath Ledger, which due to his tragic death a lot of people are now doing. Heath Ledger was a very talented actor and despite being an Oscar nominated actor didn't fully reach his potential. I think the future was very bright for him and he would have lived up to that potential. But here in 10 Things he was really great. He played the typical teen movie bad boy with another side. And he does it so well and brings so much to the role. His character was one of the leads and honestly it could have been a boring clich&eacute;d character, but Ledger brought so much and almost makes it fresh. Julia Stiles I also really liked; her character was a lot of fun and any scene with her and Heath Ledger worked great.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is excellent as well, but in my opinion Larry Miller as the over-protective father steals the show. I've always liked Larry Miller; he's one of those guys that seems to always pop up. You might not always know his name, but you'll know his face. Even in the smallest of roles he always delivers and in 10 Things I Hate About You he clearly steals the show.<br /><br />Teen driven movies often hire actors in their mid to late 20s and even as old as early 30s. While that isn't old, but for playing a teenager it sure is. So it's really refreshing to see a movie about teenagers and all the actors very close to the ages. Most of the cast in the movie were very close to the ages of their characters at the time of filming.<br /><br />In closing, while 10 Things I Hate About You may not be the most original teen comedy what it lacks in originality it makes up in just pure fun. This movie is a blast from beginning, middle to end. The highlight of the movie is Heath Ledger singing Just too Good to Be True in the bleachers to Julia Stiles.those guys that seems to always pop up.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|whew....i just watched 'across the universe'..so many convoluted memories and emotions were unleashed as splashes of surreal sunshine upon the shadows of my past...the music was surprisingly super and relevant to the story......as ironic as that may 'sound' to its critics.......the morphing of iconic characters of the era into a montage of pertinent schizophrenic personalities was brilliant...much Beatle references and symbolism...very clever indeed.....draft induction scene and Vietnam.....surreally sublime....it was a conflicted joy....such as the times themselves were for a particular sliver of the boomers......this era ended-up packaged and redefined by Madison avenue and then sold as an youthful elixir to our elders and as an aphrodisiac for a multitude of pretenders who wanted in on the sexual revolution......and what did they do????...turned it all into polyester......most sage chroniclers of the age did the same in hard copy and glossy pix for those that were not \\"on the bus\\"...by stereotyping a generation with hyperbole, distortion and misinformation.........oh well.........it seems that most of the severe criticism hinges on how ineffectively the music jives with such a poor misrepresentation of a movie about such a well documented era.....sorry!!!.....but there was a time when the Beatles music meant different things to different people, at different times and in very meaningful ways....therein existed much of its brilliance for a youthful generation that was quite diverse in its lifestyle, cares and commitments to whoever, whatever or wherever... how unfamiliar such a notion must be for those that swallowed the plastic fantastic packaging of the revolution and missed that trip...  but that cannot be helped...  the movie story line does follow the celebrated socio-politico chronology of those oftentimes serious, traumatic, frivolously carefree, exploratory and revolutionary times...in a revolutionary manner....for the few that missed this perspective........sorry that it ain't what it seemed to be......but...there are places I remember.........and still they reverberate...sorry that it ain't what it seemed to be......but...there are places I remember.........and still they reverberate

B000MRAAJW|5.0|One of the most amazing things I've ever seen on TV. Definitely something worth buying on HD DVD, this miniseries is visually amazing and well edited - there isn't a boring moment to be found. Since much of the footage was filmed on high-tech HD cameras, this looks truly incredible on a hi-def display.
0792165020|5.0|Wow! Matt Damon was awesome and of course Jude Law & Gwyneth were made to play these characters. The entire movie was wonderful start to finish. The scenery was magnificient! I will watch this movie over and over again. You never know what to expect on this thrill ride! Really enjoyable.

B000002J1O|5.0|How in the world can anyone complain about this masterpiece?  Selling England by the Pound is classic progressive rock, and just a really amazing and solid record.  These are some of the words that will enter your mind when you listen to it for the first time-    beautiful  colorful  adventurous  special  brilliant    Seriously, Genesis at one point in time was doing things that NO ordinary rock band would dare attempt.  For radio stations to completely ignore this extraordinary masterpiece just goes to show how angry and depressing this world can be.      This album has a certain lively feeling that will immediately lift you up and carry you away.  Whether it's the soothing flute playing on \\"Firth of Fifth\\" or the amazing twists and turns in the story of \\"Battle of Epping Forest\\" or the magical instrumental that can either be extremely beautiful or extremely sad to the listener (\\"After the Ordeal\\")... it's a flawless record.  Songwriting has never been better.  It's rock and roll that takes on a whole new meaning and just about anyone can appreciate this sound and style.  Buy it now.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|THE FEEL GOOD MOVIE OF THE YEAR! LOVED IT! CAMERON, KATE, JUDE & JACK WERE TERRIFIC IN THEIR ROLLS. FUN AND VERY ENTERTAINING. I WILL PROBABLY WATCH IT MANY TIME OVER THE COMING YEARS.

B00005MP58|3.0|I had not watched this when it was originally on A&E but have heard how great it was so decided to purchase it.  I expected it to be much better than it was.  Due to the length it had more of the book in it but seemed to drag and at times be down right boring.  I made the mistake of reading the enclosure with the actors/actresses comments as the comments of the lead actress made me dislike her.  I don't remember ever seeing her in anything else and her complaining about how difficult the role was and how long it took to film probably affected by opinion. In a period piece like this I would also prefer the actors project a more masculine image since they have to wear such frilly clothing    I would say it is an average mini-series, nothing special about it.  It was something nice to watch I had not previously seen during the writers strike.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|This DVD has fun special features on it.  You get to watch them rehearse quite a few of the songs.  It also allows you to use the sing a long version if you so choose.
B000WCBMA8|5.0|When I got the new Hives album, I was expecting a lot of what I had seen in their previous three albums. Fast, Stooges-like, bounce around punk rock that goes from beginning to end. Instead, I got the Black and White Album. Which was way more varied and experimental than their last albums. For starters, the shortest song clocked in at just over 2:30, and it was way longer than their last three albums. While there was still some speed in here (Tick Tick Boom, Return The Favour) they focused more on melody and rhythm this time around.     I'll admit, after the first few listens all the way through I felt that this was the worst album they put out, but still fairly good. After listening to it more though, I started to like it more and more. I now see it as one of their best albums yet, and definitely a cut above any other rock albums out there right now. While this is definitely their most mainstream album yet, it doesn't feel out of place. At first listen, \\"T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S.\\" could definitely look like they sold out, but it has really grown on me. \\"Puppet on A String\\" is definitely something new and bold, since its their first song without a guitar, but it is definitely a song I've come to appreciate a lot more. There's also a lot for long time Hives fans (Try it Again, Square One Here I Come, You Got It All Wrong) and some slower but great songs (Hey Little World, Well, All Right!). \\"Giddy Up\\" has a great catchy, southern beat that you can't help but get into. Also, depending on where you get it, you'll get \\"Fall is Just Something Grown Ups Invented\\" or \\"Hell No\\", both amazing songs that I will never understand why they weren't included on the original track list of the album. But overall my personal favorite on this album has to be \\"Won't Be Long\\", which is a song that defines this album in its entirety.     People expecting another \\"Tyrannosaurus Hives\\" or \\"Barely Legal\\" will be somewhat disappointed with the Black and White Album, but if you give it a few more listens, you will come to appreciate this album fully as another Hives masterpiece.

0452289963|1.0|This 'book' has interesting ideas to help you have better control over your emotions. These ideas need to be tested and proved. Until then i would call this work a good essay, not a book.    This good essay has also a 'hidden' dangerous side: It teachs you how to be OK with ANY situation. So why would you want, for example, to be wealthy or healthy since you learned to be OK even being poor and unhealthy. And even if you learned to be OK, would your, say, children feel the same way too? I dont think so.    Bottom line: Read the book as a guide to help you overcome the hard path to the 'top', not as a guide to accept your present unpleasant situation.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|The '00 release `Elizabeth - the Golden Age' is a visually stunning but overall ponderous exercise clearly showing how difficult the making of a worthy sequel can be. While the production values, costumes, soundtrack and cast are superb it's definitely lacking the magical \\"something\\" that raises a good film to a great one.<br /><br />There are some haunting cinematic moments not soon to be forgotten such as the sight of Elizabeth standing on a distant cliff along the dark and stormy coastline viewing the Spanish Armanda ablaze on the horizon, or the image of Elizabeth garbed in white armor with matching horse extolling the troops to greatness as her long flowing red hair and demeanor bears a striking resemblance to Saint Joan of Arc.<br /><br />Unfortunately the role of the legendary monarch is not fleshed out to the extent as it was in the script of the first film, leaving Cate Blanchett little new territory to explore within the psyche of the Virgin Queen. She is left with little to do other than vacillate between a compulsive control freak and a lonely, scorned lover along with occasionally striking a Madonna-like pose while the majestic soundtrack blares in the background clearly attempting to instill within the mind of the viewer a sense of awe and holiness.<br /><br />On the positive side, the most interesting addition to the storyline is Clive Owen in the role of explorer Walter Raleigh. It's only in Blancehtt's scenes with Clive that her character is allowed to show any emotional or intellectual depth. On a more personal basis, being by nature inclined to the arcane, I particularly appreciated the inclusion of the royal seer Dr. John Dee in the storyline.<br /><br />My Raing: Good, but not great, -3 ½ Stars-.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|You know, as I sit here reading the reviews that are given for this album, I am really in shock. This album needs to be given more recognition by people who know how to spell.  All of Kelly's albums were great, and yes, Breakaway was the one that made her famous, winning her two grammys. I for one LOVE my December. If you really wanted to get to know Kelly, just listen to this album. As you all may know, she wrote/co-wrote every song on this album, all from personal experiences. I swear, when I listen to Irvine, I feel as if I shouldn't be because it's so insanely personal to her. If you don't know the story behind that song, you should read up on it, because it will give you a new insight on Kelly and her personality as a whole. And then Chivas comes on, and I love that she ends the album on a light note. Some people think this album is  depressing, and maybe it is. But, it's also inspiring, because she's saying: &#34;Okay, this is what happened to me, now I can move on to the next bump in the road.&#34; It all depends on how you look at it. This girl may have come from American Idol (which I still don't see why that is such a big deal, that's where Kelly got to show off her versatility factor and gained a permanent fan base), but she still is one of the sweetest, nicest stars of our time. With one rockin' voice! Trust me, this girl can sing Happy Birthday, and it will go #1.
1400031362|5.0|Is there anyone who does not find the character of Precious Ramotswe charming?  This traditionally built (fat) African lady detective takes a back seat to her homely assistant detective, Mme. Makutsi, in this installment of the series.  Nevertheless, we are favored with the wise one liners of these patient busybodies.  Mme Makutsi with her oversized glasses and her too dark skin shines.  The detective agency is charged with the task of finding a young woman whose integrity matches her beauty among contestants in a beauty pagent. To the reviewer who wrote that too many story lines are left dangling, I recommend reading the next installment.  I have not read these in the proper order, but I loved them all.  If you can read these in the proper order, I recommend it.  I can't wait for the next one as this completes my read of all the outstanding installments.
B000HEYVD6|5.0|This book arrived on time. It was a little smaller than a standard book but is no prblem reading. I'm half way thru it.
B000W04S6U|4.0|First, lets get the bad out of the way. The huge problem with the Halo 3 soundtrack, is that it re-treds over previous territory too often. In the original Halo game OST, Martin and Michael both created a body of work that was made to be memorable and had the ability to stick with you outside of the game, which is part of the reason why the soundtracks are so great to listen in the first place. Halo 2 took a few of those great ideas and inter-meshed them perfectly in an abundant amount of new ideas. Halo 3 flat out has too many re-workings of the previous two and does not create enough new pieces to give it its own identity.    Almost every track presented here on the Halo 3 soundtrack contains an idea or element used in the previous scores. The opening cue, \\"Luck\\", uses a vocal line from \\"Impend\\" off Halo 2 as does \\"Released\\". The Re-constructed Halo 04 Installation/Johnson's Death Theme, both use the melody used in \\"Under Cover Of Night\\" from the original Halo soundtrack. On top of that, there are a total of 8 remake tracks (mostly done with a larger orchestra), not counting the Halo theme or other subtle hits. Don't get me wrong, these all sound great, but I think they just over did it with the remakes. There are many points in the game where I would have rather of heard something new and exiting, not an obvious re-tread of what I have already heard. Yet, with what new material there is, we are given some great stuff.    For fans of \\"Pursuit of Truth\\" off the Halo 2 soundtrack, Halo 3 soars in it's new electronic pieces. \\"Another Walk\\", \\"Infiltrate\\", \\"Move On\\", and \\"We're Done Here\\" (a fast paced version of Delta Halo's theme from the Halo 2 score) are all incredible pieces of work. \\"Keep What You Steal\\", \\"Greatest Journey\\", and \\"Roll Call\\" all succeed in giving me huge chills. \\"To Turn A Tide\\" introduces a forceful string march, while \\"Duty Bound\\" introduces a new sound not heard in the previous scores. The finale, \\"Wake Me Need Me\\" is when Marty and Co. reallyput the nail on the head. I cannot express how perfectly it fits as an ending, just about bringing me to tears listening to it.    As far as the album presentation, considering these pieces are being sequenced as they appeared in the game, Martin has done a very nice job in mixing them. At least for the first disc. It's the second disc where many of the ideas from the first disc are repeated and a few of the tracks just aren't played long enough! Some are so short, I wonder why they where even included.    Despite it's re-treads and few missteps, there really is no reason to not buy this. If you are a fan of the Halo scores or just like good music in general, pick this up. NOW!

B0010ZR160|5.0|This is an excellent film concerning the search for a missing child in which nothing is what it seems. The movie raises serious moral questions about the nature of right and wrong and our obligation to act based on our perceptions of morality. The actng was outstanding with particular emphasis on Michelle Monaghan and Ed Harris.  Ben Afleck deserves all the praise which he has received for his first directoral effort. You may well find yourself watching the movie more than once as you consider the ethical dilemmas of the characters.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|What a great ride! I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but it was great from start to finish and got me hooked right away.  I usually knit while I watch movies but I couldn't take my eyes off this visual feast.  Cate Blanchett isn't one of my favorites - I think she has great talent but leaves me cold for some reason, though her performance here is flawless.  She is perfect as Elizabeth; I can't imagine anyone else playing the part. The settings and costumes were really elaborate.  And I really enjoyed feasting my eyes on Clive Owen.  Definitely worth watching more than once.  I might buy this one.  Check it out.
0316067598|1.0|In reading this book I can't help but compare it to Andy McNab's Bravo Two Zero - it covers the same subject material involving a special forces patrol that gets compromised by goatherds and subsequently has to fight its way out of enemy territory.  The story that McNab portrays contains both gritty realism and a fair degree of humanity that Marcus Luttrell handles much more unevenly.  Either he's preaching straight from the Rush Limbaugh handbook against the \\"liberal media\\" or he's providing us with treacly description of his family's worry over his fate.    I really can't harp enough about the overtly political lens through which Luttrell portrays Afghanistan and the mysterious \\"liberals\\" who would have hung him for doing his God-given task of killing unarmed goatherders who happened to be in the wrong place.  Frankly, it's tiresome compared to the description in Bravo Two Zero, where McNab and his squad simply set that moral issue aside in order to win the battle.      Bottom line - Lone Survivor does justice to the heroes of Murphy's Ridge in the same way that a preacher or politician might - clearly delineating the goodness of the protagonists' allies and the evil of their enemies, instead of making us aware of the shades of gray and ironic coincidences of modern war.
1592289444|5.0|The Long Walk by Slavomir Rawicz was first published in 1956 and was an  immediate sensation. I came across the book after reading an obituary of the author a short while ago. The Long Walk should rank among the most  extraordinary true adventure stories ever written.    Mr Rawicz was a Polish Army officer who was arrested on a trumped-up charge by the Soviets soon after the defeat of Poland by Nazi Germany  when the country was divided between the Germans and the Soviets.     The first third of the book deals with his ghastly interrogation by the Soviets after which he is sentenced to 25 years in a Siberian Labour Camp  located near Yakutsk north of Lake Baikal. The rest of the book covers his  escape in April 1940 together with 5 others including an American Engineer  who had been employed in construction of the Moscow Metro rail system.    The escapers elect to travel south to the safety of British India. This  4000 mile journey is walked every inch of the way across some of the  world's bleakest and most difficult country including the Gobi Desert and   Tibet. Of the group of 6 escapers, 2 succumb to the arid desert and the   mountains. A girl of 17 years had joined them in Siberia; she had escaped  from a co-operative farm where she had been sentenced to lsbour. She dies  in the Gobi Desert.    Four of the escapers finally reach India in April 1941. They are warmly  welcomed and initially confined for convalesence at a Calcutta hospital.  The author eventually rejoins the Free Polish Army in the Middle East  and later arrives in England where he is trained for the airforce.    The book is strongly recommended to any reader interested in adventure in  a remote area of the world.

B00005JPKE|2.0|This movie, if it was based on a fictional basis it would be very good. The problem is not the artistic work itself, it is the false portrayal of typical Japanese soldiers of WWII. This movie was shot through western eyes and using western values. Making the Japanese soldiers then appear to be noble people. Well nothing could be further from the truth. In the rape of Nanking in 1936, the Japanese soldiers were savage and brutal. Rape and murder of thousands of Chinese. Japanese soldiers for sport, threw babies in the air and impaled them with their bayonets. In Guam, an American territory was occupied by the Japanese. They beheaded a Catholic priest and many others because the loyal Guamaninans refused to tell the Japanese where a US navy sailor was hiding. The Battann death march, where POW soldiers died. Those who fell and were too weak were bayonetted on the spot and died where they lay. Need I go on? You get the idea. I am afraid Clint Easwood fell in with the hollywood PC crowd a few years ago and served up this historical lie. He knows the truth. He grew up during WWII. Pathetic.

0786715103|5.0|This is a long book, but still you don't get bored while you are reading it. Mainly I just got upset as I read how Romeo Dallaire tried to stop this genocide from happening. There was an informant telling him that the Hutu extreemists planned to kill the Tutsis. The UN's reaction was to order Dallaire to inform Rwanda officials about what he had been told. This was a very grave mistake, since people who were planning the genocide then would get access to this information.  Mainly, very little if anything at all was done to stop the planning and the actual genocide to take place. It's disturbing to compare this genocide to the one which took place during WW II. It was decided that this should never happen again, and still there has been Cambodia and Rwanda, and what is happening in Congo nowadays (4 million dead??)  Dallaire writes that he warned that if the situation wasn't handled with care after the Rwandan civil war and genocide, the risks were high that the entire region would be destabilized. In his book he mentions how this region has been destabilized due to problems that weren't solved.  It's a disturbing, good and important book written by an eye witness, and I encourage everyone to read it.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Such a strange film: it is very like John W.

The Rocket ship is classic 30's design as well.<br />in a way it is an alternate history or an almost comic classic revival.<br />It is 30's sci fi as it deserved to be filmed, not as it<br />was filmed.
B000VR824S|4.0|I've watched and listened quite a few times before writing my brief review. Overall, not quite up to the quality of the previous DVD. I find disc 1 has some really nice moments (B.B. King, Sonny Landreth, Albert Lee), but I find it a little weak on guitar star power. Hence, the inclusion of Willie Nelson and Sheryl Crow to try and make up for that shortcoming? I tend to hit the skip button more often on this disc.    Disc 2 is where things really get interesting. No need to hit the skip button anymore. From John Mayer to Jeff Beck to EC himself to the incredible Steve Winwood this is a real winner. Song selection is really inspired especially the Blind Faith stuff Clapton and Winwood play together. The Clapton performance of George Harrison's Isn't It A Pity is also excellent. Winwood's Dear Mr. Fantasy might be the best ever live performance of that song and substantially improves upon the version from the Last Great Traffic Jam DVD.     I probably would have bought the DVD for Jeff Beck alone (very hard to find any JB video performances), but it was really great seeing Clapton and Winwood playing together again and doing justice to some old material neither of them have played frequently throughout the years. As much as Blind Faith was overhyped and dissolved very quickly back in 69, truth be told the songs have endured very nicely.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen all of the Jane Eyre movie adaptations.  Toby Stephens is by far the best Rochester I have come across to date.  Stephens brings out a more humorous/softer side to Rochester who is frequently overdone with hardness, despondency, and stark intimidation. Do not get me wrong, Stephens adds just the right amount of trepidation and sinister qualities to his character, but it is convincing and humanely plausible.  It was absolutely refreshing to watch.  I think Charlotte Bronte would be proud of this in my opinion.  One could doubt the necessity in creating so many movie variations of a single classic story, but this edition attests to the need to do so.  A tale can be told in so many, many ways - Stephens and Wilson captures \\"Jane Eyre\\" in such a manner, it was like seeing [or reading] the story for the first time  -  A must, must see!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|this is the ultimate collection for anyone looking for something more than the three hours or so war movies are restrained by. it follows the story of the airborne division from training in georgia to the final capture of hitlers eagles nest. also the extras r really good and informative. a must have for any war movies lover

B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is a wonderful and funny movie; romantic with comedy sprinkled in at just the right places.  It is now on my favorite list of movies.  I can watch it over and over and never get tired of it.
B00005JPUN|5.0|This is an excellent retelling of the original 50's sci-fi flick \\"Invasion Of The Body Snatchers\\". Had me hooked right from the very beginning to the very end. My recommendation to all viewers is to first screen the original movie prior to this Kidman version because it then becomes interesting to notice the similarities between the two. However, of course, this is not necessary, for this new version stands quite nicely all by itself.<br />Nicole is just honey to look at and her acting is superb. And it was fun to watch Daniel Craig on vacation from his James Bond role..a chance to see another side of his acting ability. I also very much enjoyed the character played by Jeffrey Wright who I had not seen since the Bill Murray movie Broken Flowers. Acting aside I enjoyed the story and I think this version compliments and sits proudly with its two predecessors. Excellent making-of features as well included.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I know most reviews pan this as one of the worst movies ever. But I kinda liked it!<br /><br />I found this movie interesting because of the visual images (and the character of Van Helsing is interesting, too).  Yes, there is plenty of silliness (women in distress with perfect hair, etc. etc. etc.), but I still found much to enjoy.<br /><br />NOT for those who take their movies seriously, or who want an artistic film with terrific writing.  Also not for the person who likes super-scary, super-gorey movies (this one is still too scary for kids)-- this movie can't decide if it is a comedy of a monster movie.  But if you are looking for some silly monster fun, this movie may deliver for you.<br /><br />added 8/09:  Fans of illustrator/writer Brom might be interested to know he worked on this film!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|I would call this \\"Dr Who for Adults\\".  I don't like all the plots - but that is the point of good Adult TV, to expose you to other possibilities.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|This movie is not exactly true to the plot of Jane Austen's novel. It is a beautiful adaptation though, very passionate and concise, and it reveals the plot of the story in a very romantic way. It reminded me of watching the newer Pride and Prejudice with Matthew McFadien, verses the older BBC adaptation with Colin Firth. I would recommend reading the book first, just to get a better idea of the personalities of the main characters. I have watched the movie at least a dozen times. I really enjoy it, and so will you if you're an Austen fan. It is well worth the money, because you will get a lot of enjoyment out of this video.
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|If you prefer fast paced shoot 'em up, mindless, plotless movies like shoot 'em up or the better part of most modern action movies; this is not for you. Go rent Navy Seals or Resident Evil and enjoy.    However, if you prefer a movie that allows for a story and great cinematic imagery(not too many close ups), then you will find this movie a breath of fresh air. It reminds me of old Bogart detective movies and older movies of substance from the 70's. A masterfully done story that does not follow the book exactly for complexity and time factor reasons. But, does a very good job of staying true to the story and augments where necessary.

0060832819|5.0|Coelho's The Alchemist gets all the press, but I enjoyed this book so much more. The biggest difference for me was that I connected to the characters in The Zahir, whereas those in The Alchemist were too broadly drawn -- like the stars in Aesop's fables, I learned from them, but I did not feel for them.<br /><br />Other than that, Coelho's trademark style and simplicity, his worldliness, his intimacy -- these are all intact, and effective as ever. He's really a wonderful writer, and a great storyteller, and a lot of things that I aspire to be.<br /><br />I can't say that I agree with everything Coelho posits in The Zahir, but I can say that I think people need to know and understand points of view that do not agree with their own, in order to better understand themselves and the world.

1563899426|5.0|It is one thing to come up with a great idea; it is another thing to execute it.  Luckily the first issue in FABLES is a success on both levels.  As others have written, the idea is that some malevolent entity -- referred to merely as \\"the Adversary\\" -- drove all of the legends and creatures of Fables out of their magical lands, until they all congregated in a place where, for whatever reason, the Adversary did not wish to pursue them.  The place?  New York City.  There the Fables -- well known figures such as Bigby Wolf (i.e., the Big Bad, who actually has befriended the Pigs, one of whom crashes at his apartment), the sisters Snow White and Rose Red, Little Boy Blue, Old King Cole, Bluebeard, Jack (of Beanstalk fame), Prince Charming, and many, many others all live clandestinely among the Mundys (Mundanes).  Their world is turned upside down when Jack reports to Bigby the apparent murder of his girlfriend Rose Red.<br /><br />Just about everything in this volume is well executed except, in my opinion, one thing, but of that in a second.  All the small touches seem just right, from the idea that magic has played a role in helping them to adapt -- the inside of Bluebeard's 4th floor apartment, for instance, opens to a space the size of a castle, not unlike Dr. Who's Tardis -- to the ways the original character flaws revealed of the various characters continues to play a role.  For instance, Jack is still constantly anxious to get rich quick, while King Cole, the mayor of the Fables, is quite merry, too merry to be much involved in the actual running of government, which is left to Snow White.  But oh, don't say anything to her about the rumors about her and the dwarfs.<br /><br />My lone complaint with this fine book is, I will admit, not about the book that it is, but the book it could have been.  I personally think it was a mistake to turn it into a parlor murder mystery.  That is was so turning was obvious well before Bigby explicitly stated this to be the case.  The parlor murder mystery is the antithesis of noir and the hard-boiled school.  Yet Bigby Wolf would seem to lend himself far more promisingly to the latter than the rather more urbane former.  It would, of course, required a far darker story, at least in tone.  And perhaps that would have been incompatible with the folk tale origins of the various characters.  But we would have had a different denouement than the one we got.  In hard-boiled stories a la Hammett, Chandler, and MacDonald, there end up more grays than blacks and whites.  The black and white quality of the mystery in this comic just seems to clash stylistically with the very odd group of characters.  But perhaps this is all just a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />Still, I can't imagine many fans of comics not being delighted with this book.  I immediately ordered the next several books in the series upon finishing this.  I want to see what happens next.rder mystery is the antithesis of noir and the hard-boiled school.

0783240287|5.0|I love this production. Webber and Rice have done such an amazing job of weaving the story of Joseph in with almost every musical genre there is. Our kids were in the children's chorus in the old days. It is so fun to listen and sing along.    We also love to watch and listen to Donny Osmond sing.  The voice control and technique he shows are impeccable, and emotion he brings fits the story perfectly. The acting and non-verbal communication of the actors (singers) is superb. We especially like the narrator, Maria Friedman.    Buy it !
B000YA82F6|3.0|Juno (Jason Reitman, 2007)<br /><br />For over a decade, Trainspotting has been the undisputed king of awful, unlistenable soundtracks. But now, along comes Juno, with a soundtrack so mind-numbing it makes Trainspotting's flatulent disc sound like the finest Merzbow. I mean, come on, they actually went out and hunted down the worst song the Velvet Underground ever recorded. (And for those who keep saying the songs fit with the character, would someone who idolizes Iggy and the Stooges really listen to that junk? Really? Honestly? Think about that for a while.)<br /><br />It's too bad, because the rest of the movie ranges from the not-too-terribly-awful to the brilliant. The brilliant can be summed up in two names: J. K. Simmons (Law and Order) and Allison Janney (The West Wing), who play the parents of the title character, and who are two of the out-and-out funniest characters I've seen on a screen for a long, long time. They absolutely steal the movie; no one else in it (including the usually wonderful Ellen Page as the title character) even comes close.<br /><br />Which brings me to the other end of the spectrum, because I spent much of the movie wondering how much Simmons and Janney were improvising; the rest of the script ranges from the awkwardly silly (\\"I rock a Harmony.\\" My god, do kids really talk like that these days?) to the embarrassing (\\"that's one doodle that can't be undid, home slice\\"-- note that no one has used the term \\"home slice\\" in at least ten years).<br /><br />But for all that, the reason I went to see this movie was Ellen Page, playing way out of type here-- a break from doing intense horror/thriller flicks like Hard Candy and An American Crime, I guess. To the extent it's possible to own a character with such terrible lines, Page does it, and to her credit manages to get through the whole film playing the character straight. This may be an even more impressive thing than carrying a character who's brilliantly written (Hard Candy's Hayley Stark, for example), and how much of the mannerisms of the character were written into the script and how much are Page's own work (or Reitman's) is subject to debate; I give Page the benefit of the doubt because she's proven herself such a strong actress in the past.<br /><br />An amusing little comedy, but pulling a Best Picture nomination over The Diving Bell and the Butterfly? Don't know about that. ***f the mannerisms of the character were written into the script and how much are Page's own work (or Reitman's) is subject to debate; I give Page the benefit of the doubt because she's proven herself such a strong actress in the past.

B00005IC2H|5.0|This isn't the type of music many people will understand, enjoy, or consider to even be \\"real music.\\"     It's not a cd you can just play and enjoy.     You have to let the music sink in deep to appreciate. But if you sit there one day with the album trying to let it sink in you're missing the point. You have to be one with the music.    When you're at a point in your life where nothing is going as you've planned and you don't know what to do listen this album. Listen to Sea Change by Beck. Listen to Unknown Pleasures by Joy Division. Listen to this album again.    Then everything will make sense.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|My three year old niece and I enjoyed this film to the fullest!  Neither of us had seen the movie, only clips on sing a long tapes and it gave us both a very happy feeling and we have now watched it many times since we first got it and every time we view it, we have the same reaction every time!  This move keeps my niece's attention and she loves all the songs and sings along.  She loves the crazy eyes of Kaa!  A film for the whole family.
B000002UBB|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! Steve Miller hit a commercial milestone with this album. Not even The Joker hinted at what was around the corner for this artist. It has always been hard for me to choose between this album & Book of Dreams. They are very similar & there's a good reason for it; both were recorded at the same time. Capitol Records decided wisely to issue them separately a year apart. Best songs on the album include \\"Fly Like an Eagle\\", \\"Mercury Blues\\" & \\"Rockin' Me Baby\\".    It's a shame that Steve Miller took so long to release new material after these two albums. With the amount of time it took him he should've had some good material but, alas, no. Steve Miller is a competent journeyman guitarist, his main strength being his ability to recycle riffs & songs making them his own.    Steve Miller has not enjoyed the commercial success since Fly Like an Eagle & Book of Dreams. The reason is simple: He could not duplicate what he did on these two albums.

B000PC0S5K|4.0|I really enjoyed reading A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle and find that his emphasis on the need for awareness and living in the present is on the mark. As a Christian counselor and college professor I am very interested in how the mind effects the physical body and a person's life. Tolle's  definition of the ego is different from the Freudian perspective and shows it as a controlling force that can be destructive. I agree with his description of the impact of negative emotions on an individual as well as the suffering that results from not living in the present. I presented a more succinct discussion of these topics from a Christian perspective in my book on psychology and Christianity. A New Earth can be beneficial to readers of all religious persuasions. I recommend An Integration 0f Psychology & Christianity for an application approach to dealing with negative emotions and developing present-mindedness.
B000YMQI6E|4.0|This is not the type of movie I would normally choose to watch,especially at night alone. Great story line to this movie and made me almost jump outta my seat a few times. Only downfall I will say about this movie is that there was to much foreshadowing in the movie and I was preetty much able to draw a sucessful conclusion as to how the movie was going to end within the first 30 minutes,BUT...either way,I did enjoy this movie.
B000X3KZVI|2.0|When you compare this dvd to the 1993 performance in the Proctors Theatre New York, it really is a disappointment. She is like a complete different person now, without the vocal power of 15 years ago. If you ask me, I would rather listen to the 1993 version of Hero, than this one.   I do have to say that the picture and audio quality of this dvd is really good but that doesn't make it a good concert. Just buy the older dvd's of Mariah and don't waste your money on this.
0618918248|5.0|I've been an athiest long before the movie 'Contact' but Mr Dawkins book 'The God Delusion' is 99.9% of everything I wanted to say and then some. The other .1% is a labored effort to refind information about Ethiopian ruler Menelik II in which he took priest and shamen out of power and the people thrived. That's important because it points to religion's inhibitory tendency which is so often underplayed.
B000LPS4BG|4.0|I wont bother reviewing the movie itself. It has to stand as one of the 100 best films of all time (at least in my list). As far as Blu Ray goes, this is much improved over my original \\"flipper\\" 2-sided DVD version. Some reviewers have mentioned the grain in some parts of the film. That's just the stock they made the transfer from. There is another part where there is a vertical line in the scene through De Niro that is part of the negative. But when the film is sharp, the transfer is perfect. I think this is especially obvious at the very beginning of the movie when there is tight close-up of a young Henry Hill looking out the window of his apartment and you can see the details of what looks like a green contact lens (to match Liotta I suppose).<br />I was disappointed by the audio. It seemes a bit muddy. I need to go back to my \\"flipper\\" version to see if it was any better. This may be a case of trying to make Dolby 5.1 out of an old soundtrack.<br />Overall, Certainly worth the price. Worth replacing an older version (not sure if this applies to the newer \\"collecters edition\\" or not.<br />By the way, one fun part of watching this movie is picking out all the Soprano's characters that were in this film. Christoper, Pauli, \\"Old\\" Carmine (Tony Lipp plays \\"Tony the Wop\\" or something like that), I think even \\"Big Pussy\\", Vincent Pastore has a walk on bit. For \\"The Wire\\" fans, I noticed that Isiah Whitlock Jr (the \\"honorable\\" Sen Clay Davis) had a bit part playing a Dr when Henry is picking his wheelchair bound brother up from the hospital near the end of the film.
0060558121|4.0|Every so often, a book comes along that is sui generis -- in a class of its own, unlike anything else. Maybe it's Pynchon's GRAVITY'S RAINBOW, McCarthy's BLOOD MERIDIAN, or Marquez's ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE. Neil Gaiman's AMERICAN GODS, while far from scaling those vaunted literary heights, nevertheless deserves to be singled out as an unforgettable, uniquely inspired novel of modern American life.<br /><br />When Gaiman's story opens, a taciturn man known as Shadow has just received an early release from prison because his wife Laura died with Shadow's close friend in an automobile accident. On his way home for the wake and funeral, he meets a mysterious stranger who calls himself Wednesday (since, as the stranger asserts, that's today's day of the week). With a little persistent cajoling from Wednesday, the otherwise directionless and unemployed Shadow agrees to work for the stranger as his driver and general gopher. Thus begins a bizarre relationship between the two, combined with a picaresque road tale through much of America's central and north central heartland.<br /><br />AMERICAN GODS is a difficult story to describe without spoiling its delicious surprises. Suffice to say, the book's title refers indeed to a large group of small \\"g\\" gods living below the radar, disguised in human form and struggling to eke out mostly meager existences. Gaiman's underlying premise cultivates the notion that every race and group of peoples who have traveled to or lived in America - ancient Egyptians, Norse Vikings, Irish settlers (with their leprechauns), African slaves from hundreds of villages and tribes, Hindus, American Indians - have each brought their worshipped gods with them. Those gods physically \\"took up residence\\" in this land, only to be discarded or forgotten over time due to their believers having died out or being assimilated into other religious beliefs. As their believers declined in numbers, those gods' power declined accordingly. Strength derives from belief, or at least a proxy for belief in the form of sacrifice.<br /><br />Gaiman excels with his oddball characterizations of these sadly spent gods whose true forms Shadow is occasionally permitted to see. They constitute a panoply of memorable figures: quirky, irascible, and still haughty despite their reduced circumstances, yet entertainingly sympathetic for the human-like foibles that plague them. In another setting, they could be a collection of misspent souls from a Cuckoo's Nest asylum or cranky but vital oldsters from a retirement home. However, the author's efforts are not nearly so endearing, and far less convincing, in presenting America's new, unnamed gods of mass media and the information age, now the recipients of the country's attention and adoration. It is the threat of war, a final battle of the heavens, between the old gods and these 21st Century secular gods, that propels the novel's action. Not surprisingly, Shadow plays a far more important role in these proceedings than he could ever have imagined.<br /><br />AMERICAN GODS offers a marvelous satirical view of contemporary American culture and life. The book is filled with clever notions and imaginative portrayals, such as the scene where Wednesday takes the too-human Shadow to a meeting held \\"behind the curtains\\" as it were, in another dimension accessible only to the gods. Perhaps the novel's biggest shortcoming arises from refusing to acknowledge (or even mention) the gods who still command human belief, such as Jesus, Allah, or Vishnu. Then again, Gaiman's view could be that these big \\"G\\" Gods are simply too powerful or busy to worry about the survival struggles of Norse gods and African tribal deities.<br /><br />Regardless, AMERICAN GODS is enjoyable and delectably irreverent, a fun read with a creative premise and entertaining characters that will stop readers in their tracks and make them think. If only for a minute, that is, but at least long enough to give those small \\"g\\" gods a little energy boost.

0618918248|3.0|Although it makes for thought provoking reading (and I read it with a very open mind), Dawkins spends way too much time in the beginning defining what he refers to as \\"god.\\" I think there is a certain amount of unspoken understanding on behalf of the reader as to what \\"god\\" the book is to be written about. However, by the second chapter, I found myself wanting to tell the author, \\"Alright already! I get it! I get which god you are referring to- just get to the point of the argument!\\" Frustrating as that is, once Dawkins gets to the verb, he makes compelling arguments to win his case. He just takes the longest route possible to win the reader over, therefore almost boring me to the point of abandoning the book by chapter 2. (In short, he could have chopped out about 50-75 pages and STILL made his points. Someone needs to school Mr. Dawson in the fine art of editing). If you hang in there, it eventually becomes worth the read. But boy was I tired!
B000UD08HW|4.0|Really loved the content on this DVD. The songlist and performane is first rate, and found the extras to be very interesting. The Dolby TrueHD tack is awsome, so I rate the audio 5 star. Unfortunately the reviews you read that complain about the grainy video are accurate. It's hard to understand why in an HD format this would happen, but I don't think the problem is with the transfer to Bluray, but more to do with the original recording. In any case if you are a fan of Gilmour and you appreciate good audio quality, then the disc is well worth buying, but if your priority is crisp video quality, you'd better give it a miss.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|This movie has so many twists that you will need to watch it more than once. The vocabulary of street thugs is impressive. Proof that there's more to our language than the F word.

Great movie for teenagers, many lessons to learn here.
B000HIVO64|2.0|Guero had a great vibe to it, nothing compared to anything else in his catalogue, but it now seems Beck has done everything he is capable of doing right, and this album, believe me, finds him surfing the sine waves of total mediocrity. This, surely, is a sendoff album much like Neil Young's Landing On Water. Still, this is worse than that for many reasons.<br /><br />I would truly love if he did some type of sequel to One Foot.... to something more intelligent, cynical and real. Anyway you have it, it is Beck's time to wait a while, do something worthwhile when the right time presents itself, like NIN, or risk becoming obscure nonsense and primitive stupidity like Weezer. It is not always cool to just shovel all the crap in your closet and then expect people to pay for it. This album is a total torrent monster for a reason....
0141439661|4.0|\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was first published in 1811, although it appears that Jane Austen had worked on various versions of the novel since the 1790's.  It is less polished than the later, classic \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but it contains all the familiar elements we expect and enjoy in an Jane Austen novel.<br /><br />The novel is built around the two Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, whose contrasting styles are the \\"sense and sensibility\\" of the title.  Elinor is the elder sister, patient, considerate and practical.  Marianne, on the other hand, knows no halfway love of anything in life.<br /><br />As the story opens, their father has just died, leaving the family estate to his son by a first marriage and his second wife and three daughters in near destitution.  The widow and three daughters move to a small cottage on the estate of a distant kinsman in Devonshire.  Elinor leaves behind the cherished Mr. Edward Ferres, a shy but loyal and seemingly compatible friend, who has however strangely not offered marriage to Elinor.  The beautiful Marianne attracts two suitors soon after their arrival in Devonshire, the older, sober and respectable Colonel Brandon, and the young, handsome, and charming Mr. Willoughby.  Willoughby wins Marianne's heart, and an engagement is expected momentarily.<br /><br />To Marianne's immense disappointment, Willoughby unexpectedly departs for London without proposing.  The two sisters are persuaded to travel with an aunt to London to take part in the social scene.  In London, the sisters will learn shocking news about their respect suitors, and each will learn to cope with the help of the other.  The journey back to Devonshire will set the stage for dramatic developments for Elinor and Marianne.<br /><br />Austen's sense of dialogue and ability to set up scenes staging are less acute in \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" than in later novels, but she makes up for it by a more emotional approach to the characters and some savage if indirect commentary on the social customs of the day.  Those readers whose introduction to the story is the excellent 1995 movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" will find a longer, more subtle, and complex story in Austen's novel.  This novel is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen.tary on the social customs of the day.

B0013KTGAG|3.0|Beautiful cinematography, solid special effects (for 1999) and tight dialogue are the highlights of this strangely engrossing film.  Not for those expecting heavy action, a simple plot or clear lines between good and evil.      Mixed acting performances, but overall a good story which will leave the more philosophical among us engaging in deep discussion over the after-film drink or dessert, despite the somewhat predictable ending.

B00009ATIX|4.0|When I first heard that George Clooney was going to be acting in a serious role, I was understandably wary.  But once I saw him in Solaris, I must admit, I gained a fair amount of respect for his commitment to conveying heavy themes.      The movie itself has been criticized for being too slow and dull, and to a certain degree, the second complaint is legitimate.  If the director had made less use of visual symbolism, it probably would have been slightly less tedius to watch.  However, this criticism is partially mitigated by the excellent story and the truly deep questions that the film asks.  How would you react if you were confronted with a long lost loved one?  What would you do if you had an opportunity to correct a traumatic past mistake?  Solaris asks both of these questions, while doing so in a very unassuming way, forcing the audience members to answer them for themselves.  However, this alone is not what makes Solaris so relevant.    The truly valuable aspect of the film is its investigation of the thought processes associated with obsession, using extraordinary circumstances to illustrate that not all problems have solutions and resultantly, sometimes our greatest adversary can be our personal need to rationalize our unique human experiences.    Solaris is a slow movie, and its ambitious artsiness can become tiresome.  But it has a very valuable message and that alone makes it worth four and a half stars.
B000KQF6X0|4.0|I will spare you the plot details - tons about what happens has already been written.  I'll just tell you if what happens, works.  In this case... it does, and very successfully.    Put a couple of NYC cops, who are far from being your text-book, right-out of the academy-pristine cops (which seems about right for a couple of NYC detectives), and send them to Japan to deliver and then recover a really bad gangster.    This movie was made at the end of the 80's, but the settings, story line and dialogue is perfect even for 2008.  It is an action movie that really has you interested in what is going on and makes you want to get the bad guy, right along with our hero cops.    The pace of the movie is done quite well and Ridley Scott leaves very little on the screen that was unnecessary - even the karaoke bar scene had it's place and was worthwhile.  The sense and feel of the movie is very realistic and believable.  The thugs scare you and the cops are out to get their man - no matter what.  That's what we want in our cops vs. robber movie.    The side plots in this movie work well and never stray from the main action.  The whole - is Michael Douglas's character a bad cop on the take, worked for me and I was interested.  Kate Capshaw's character was well done and her screen time was good, which was edited enough so that you didn't feel they went overboard with her.  The movie does a sweet job by not giving us too much info about the gangsters, and that works quite well for the pacing in the film.    Give Black Rain a look and it will be worth your time.  You'll also understand why movie cops put tv cops to shame, for the most part.  The Blu-Ray was clean and perfect-o.  Exactly what we want out of our hi-def movies.

B000EGF0NW|4.0|Hook: A poignant memoir written by Alice Sebold telling her story of rape, violence and how it transformed her in the person she is today.         In The Lovely Bones, Sebold takes the reader on a journey of rape, death and the many shades of loss involved with both. This book is shocking, dramatic, and long lasting.        In Sebold's second book, Lucky, she takes us behind the curtain to reveal her true story. In 1981, Sebold, an eighteen year-old coed attending Syracuse University, was raped. It was an act of violence that has become the theme to Sebold's existence still today.        With writing that can only be described as gripping honesty, you won't be sorry you picked this book up and you won't be able to put it down!
B000784WMW|5.0|This is my favorite version of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel Jane Eyre. Timothy Dalton is perfect as Rochester - dark, stern and ruggedly handsome; but you can sense something good in his nature, and Daltons acting talent portrays Rochester well in all of his moods.    Zelah Clark is excellent as Jane - you sense that she has had a foundation of proper manners, having been raised in her youth at Gate's Head - a magistrate's home; yet Clark also shows well the side of Jane that is patient, solid, unable to shock; having been forced to endure the hardships and staff of Lowood Hall.  She also portrays well the side of Jane that was fiercly independent and 'fairy-like'; really quite a complex character for her young age - who Clark carries off beautifully.    I think that one of the enduring qualities of this novel is in the fact that despite all of her challenges in a class and male-based society, Jane has maintained an inner strength to carry her though and rise above it all.  And through her willingness to do what is right, and walk away from all she could possibly hope for in a soul mate; providence allows this to eventually happen.  This is all portrayed perfectly with the actors, the screenplay, and the fact that the dialogue is virtually out of the book.      The only shortcoming of this version is the style of filming, and the score (e.g. nothing like John Williams score for the GC Scott version). It appears more like a play than a film. However, the acting is so good, you forget about those things shortly after it starts!

B0011HOEY4|5.0|This viewer rented the DVD form of AMERICAN GANGSTER, having passed it by in the theatrical run, thinking that it was yet another 'crime and corruption in New York' genre film.  It was surprising to discover that this very long film (just under three hours in the Unrated version) is completely riveting and in a way far different than the usual gangster film: this story, based on real people as outlined in an article by Mark Jacobson (transformed for the screen by Steven Zaillian), and while it has its share of grisly killings, it seems more concerned with the issues of integrity in the face of police corruption as embodied in the character of Richie Roberts, the etiology of the heroin use escalation following the Vietnam War, and the presence of a 'Black Mafia' lead by one Frank Lucas.  It is delivered with compelling gusto and intelligence by director Ridley Scott and has some of the best acting of the year.  In other words, this is not a film to be lightly dismissed as a Hollywood retread, but instead it is a tense drama with many very fine points.<br /><br />Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) follows the footsteps of his idol Bumpy (Clarence Williams III) who 'ran' the Harlem streets, and when Bumpy dies, Lucas inherits his mantle.  Lucas is wise, cunning, a gentleman, a powerhouse of ideas, and quickly finds a way to bring the best uncut heroin from the Far East to the streets of New York at a price that undercuts the other mobsters' product.  To establish his control he enlists his family, including his brother Huey (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and rapidly becomes the kingpin of the streets.<br /><br />Simultaneously within the NYPD we meet Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) whose personal life is a mess but who, with his partner Lou (Ted Levine) discovers corruption in the NYPD and more particularly the Drug Enforcement sector of the police: Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) works with the existing drug lords, grabs their drugs and money and then recycles both to his benefit.  During a particular drug bust, Richie and Lou discover a stash of nearly a million dollars and turn the money into the police - a deed that makes the duo seem foolish and lose the respect of their fellow cops but establishes Roberts as a man who is committed to being a good detective.<br /><br />From these two separate studies the film weaves the development of each character and the interaction between Roberts and Lucas we know will take place.  The end result may be known to those who followed the story as it developed in the 1970s, but for those for whom this true story is new information, the resolution of the film is fast-paced, thrilling, illuminating, and just plain fine cinema.  Both Washington and Crowe  are in peak form, as are those in the many small roles (Ruby Dee, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Lymari Nadal, Carla Gugino, Cuba Gooding etc).  This is more of a drama than an action film and while many may feel the final moments of the movie are weak, they do reveal the true ending of the story and say a lot about the narrow line between crime and criminal investigation. This is one of Ridley Scott's most successful films and one that will be around for many years as a model for the medium.

0452289963|5.0|There are so many personal growth books on the market that sifting through them makes even the most open-minded rather jaded to the prospect of enlightenment. Clearly, Oprah Winfrey's seal of approval brings the necessary cachet to make this one rise to the top of my personal reading list since she steered me to a book I do treasure, Don Miguel Ruiz's [[ASIN:1878424505 The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom]].  The two books have a lot in common in delineating how we - not the circumstances around us - are responsible for our own personal happiness. Contemporary spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle, who already wrote the groundbreaking [[ASIN:1577314808 The Power of Now]], eschews specific religious lessons to focus on the detrimental effect of the ego in our lives. He espouses that only in diminishing ego can we fulfill ourselves in the present moment. Otherwise, we are held victim to endless reductionism about the perceived value we have of ourselves, whether it's through our possessions, our social roles, our gender, or whatever point of comparison we personally decide. The ego thrives on such comparisons and the insistence toward the combat of proving oneself right and judging others for their perceived gaps.<br /><br />Focusing on the \\"now\\" is Tolle's key philosophy since that is the only way to bypass the inevitable chaos in the universe. He accurately sees this chaos as an incessant stream of involuntary and compulsive thinking further obscured by the emotions that accompany it. It becomes a constant push-me-pull-you dilemma where one becomes preoccupied with some event that has happened but somehow should not have happened per one's mindset, or alternatively, something that has not happened but should have. Tolle shows how one's alternate universe entraps the thinking in such a way as to miss the power of what is happening in the present moment. My favorite parts of the book are the last three chapters - \\"The Discovery of Inner Peace\\", \\"Your Inner Purpose, and \\"A New Earth\\" - when the author drives the reader toward transformative solutions, especially when he discusses the three modalities of awakened doing: acceptance, enjoyment and enthusiasm. Even though the book should not be viewed as a panacea for life's stumbling blocks, Tolle does provide a sturdy foundation for the stepwise thinking that helps each of us move toward a higher consciousness of our own accountability for happiness.pose, and \\"A New Earth\\" - when the author drives the reader toward transformative solutions, especially when he discusses the three modalities of awakened doing: acceptance, enjoyment and enthusiasm.

B00133KFGW|5.0|August Rush is a well told story of a boy discovering the wonder of who he is as he discovers the wonder of music.  The music is varied but all good, and the acting is pretty much the same, varied but all good.  Robin Williams gives his usual excellence and Freddie Highmore carries the film very well on his young shoulders.  Softies will need a hanky for the final scene.
0060558121|3.0|I have found this book a colossal puzzle, as I could not understand clearly what was the core idea of the author, in terms of the fight between the old Gods against the new Gods as well as the message one should understand from the epilogue of the book. On the other hand, the story telling is superb, in the pages related to \\"Coming to America\\" (events, times and characters of the ancient tribes crossing the strait of Bering, the African slaves era and the first settlers of the pre-independence times, that constitute key parts of the origin of the United States, Excellent are also the chapters about the opportunities and misfortunes the main character (Shadow) experiences and the characters he meets during his trip across rural towns in the Northeastern US.

B000M341QE|4.0|[[ASIN:B000M341QO The Departed (Full Screen Edition)]]  Director Martin Scorsese used his usual violent style. The film is based on a storyline from 2002, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, which was as well a policeman/mafia undercover story. Great play from Leonardo Di Caprio as undercover cop and Matt Damon as undercover mobster. Beside that strong supporting cast, including Jack Nicholson as the mafia boss and Mark Wahlberg as a hot-headed police sergeant.Nicholson and Wahlberg provide acting master-classes every time they appear.In general a great movie fun to watch.

B00011RPB0|5.0|I had the fortune to lived in Japan (Tokio, Nagoya, Kyoto and Osaka) for one month, and enjoyed the style of life of the japan people. This movie is reflex of that style of life, not totally, but the atmosphere is magic, with the street and some interior places. Great movie, amazing direction, sweet acting.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|petermcguireteanau is my web site. The crossroads is a good DVD, There are 2 disks in the pack and I thought the first was better than the second. I also have crossroads 2007 and it is also very good, A mix of music,, blues,, country rock etc,,
0143038419|4.0|I enjoyed the topics and could REALLY relate with the author on a lot of subjects, so I enjoyed this book.  There are a lot of things that many people wouldn't like or agree with including the emotional nature of the writing.  I, personally, applaud the courage it took to write down her raw emotions dealing with her past relationships and depression.  I thought it was truly insightful.    If you detest emotionally driven, spiritual journey, autobiographical books, than this isn't for you.    I honestly expected to dislike it, but was pleasantly surprised.
B00104W8T6|5.0|A great soundtrack for a terrific film. Most of the songs are soft, eccentric, and folky (or anti folky, as those who know more than I do call the style). Being in my fourth decade of existence, I wasn't aware of most of these bands (I stopped following rock closely in my twenties) but they are really good. I didn't knew who Kimya Dawson and the Moldy Peaches were before seeing the movie, but I can say now their songs are terrific - I love Tire Swing, Loose Lips, Tree Hugger and Anyone else by You - the latter is a leit motif during the film, as is played several times there, including a moving finale with the two main actors, Ellen Page and Michael Cera playing it. I also love All I Want is You by someone called Barry Louis Polisar - the song appears on the film's opening credits, and its use of harmonica is reminiscent - with all the distances, of course - of early Bob Dylan. There are also some older songs, like the great Dearest by Buddy Holly, The Kinks \\"A Well Respected Man\\", Sonic Youth's cover of The Carpenter's Superstar, a cover of Sea of Love by someone I don't know, and The Velvet Underground's I'm Sticking with You. Don't miss this soundtrack.
1400082773|5.0|Liked it, liked it. It is, like he says in the intro he later added, a bit \\"indulgent\\" with some of the descriptions and use of words, but it's really a great story and an insightful look at his development as a person. In thinking about him as a potential president, i was surprised to see how comforted i could be by the simple ability he has to walk through a thought process, going from point a to b--a real commentary on our current commander and chief. But more substantively, the internal, reflective life that he clearly lays out in much of this book is reassuring, giving the clear impression that he weighs his thoughts and choices carefully. In  a related way, it reveals how his aim with those choices is to make things more right in the world, and that he feels that can only happen if one approaches life honestly, willing to plod along if need be, and wrestle with decisions and considerations. Otherwise just an intriguing series of events he's lived through and been shaped by.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Letters From Iwo Jima  DVD<br /><br />Letters From Iwo is a companion piece to [[ASIN:B000O77QDI Flags of Our Fathers (Two-Disc Special Edition) [HD DVD]]], both directed by Clint Eastwood, both about the circumstances surrounding the battle for Iwo Jima.  This movie is told from the Japanese point of view.<br /><br />If the movie is true, unfortunately the Japanese general was competent, when he first arrived, he got off his plane and walked the terrain, he did not just go into the operations center and look at maps.<br /><br />He then completely scrapped the defensive plan.  Moved the revetments so that the machine guns had enfilading fire. Moved the artillery back to the military crest on the mountain. Then dug in his troops into the mountains, rendering the U.S. Naval bombardment effectively impotent.<br /><br />If we'd had today's liberal media back then, we would have quit after the first one thousand soldiers and marines were killed.<br /><br />I for one am glad we didn't have instant communication in 1944.<br /><br />Highly recommended for military buffs and fans of World war II action movies.<br /><br />Gunner  February, 2008
B00009V8Z9|4.0|I first got this album two years ago and I still listen to it! I thought it would be more rockish upbeat because of his hit single \\"I dont wanna be\\" but  most of the songs are slow moving. Even though I was a little disapointed, the rest of the songs are amazing to listen to with the guitar and his voice! Amazing cd!
B000O77RLE|1.0|This film was a very clever idea and I enjoyed the premise until they introduced the American characters.  Then, I was outraged!!!  It is one thing to try to humanize the war and human sacrifices a war entails.  It is completely shameful to humanize a brutal enemy who massacred Millions of Chinese a short time before, and then proceeded to try to spread that brutality to American Soil! Japanese, who thought it was more honorable to kill their men through suicide then to suffer a loss.  If you want to humanize that, I can go a long with the premise.  But, to de-humanize our American Heroes as nothing more then brutal, uncaring, beasts? It is intolerable!!  Clint Eastwood ought to be ashamed, but that is the legacy of our HEROS, he has the liberty that the Japanese so wanted to take away.  The lessons of History, we can't forget; generation to generation this is our debt! I did not watch the end...
B00133KFGW|5.0|I was very surprised at how much I loved this movie and the music in it. The movie was amazing, the actors were awesome. The music was unbelievable! I don't recommend movies or music lightly. This is wonderful .
0743289684|5.0|I saw an interview between Ayaan and Christiane Amapour on a CNN special and became interested in reading this book. After reading this book, I became more aware of the Muslim religion and the pain that so many women suffer throughout the world. I was impressed at Ayaan's account of her life without shame and being able to continue living and growing as a person. She should be commended for writing a book that is so inspiring and smart.
0393061310|5.0|Prior to reading \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" I had a very broad sense of knowledge in the history of man.  I have been able to use the valuable lessons of this book, such as how food production was domesticated, and why certain societies prosper and other fail, to establish an economic forecast for our current trials and tribulations.  Coming from a business background, I am now more affluent in rationalizing why certain economic conditions constrain one country while allowing another to prosper.  I highly recommend this book without any hesitation to anyone interested in increasing their general knowledge of human societies.
B000I5X824|5.0|Just the kind of cd I needed to hear before seeing this band in concert.  This is an awesome mix of Staind's best works yet.  I did hear that a new album is due out soon and can't wait for that!  A must have for any fan or for anyone who has yet to become one.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|This product was in the exact condition I was told it would be in, and it arrived in good time. I enjoy buying products from Amazon, becuase I know that the quatily is always above average, and that if there was a problem, Amazon would take action!
B000P2A256|5.0|First of all, I loved the 1st album \\"Songs About Jane\\" and seriously doubted whether or not this 2nd album would measure up.  Suprisingly enough and with a little coaxing from seeing/hearing a few of their new songs on SNL one weekend, I was smitten!  Great cd that delivers true Maroon 5 melodies with a hint of new sounds that rock!  Love it, love it, love it!!!
B000Y2WAL6|5.0|The Eels have been one of my favorite bands for years now, and it is awesome to see this compilation. There are so many new songs on these 2 discs that I have never heard before, and a ton of great B-Sides and live performances of some of the best Eels songs. E is an absolute genius, and it is really cool to see even more of that shine through on this 2-disc set. Enjoy!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|When I first saw the Theatrical version, it was a complete mess.  There was no character development and it did not even warrant an inclusion in my top 100 movies of all time.    However, with the Director's cut, the movie is now completely transformed.  There is more character development and exposition without slowing the movie's pacing.  This is the defnitive version of the movie and is what it should have been.  I have now discarded the original and to me, this is the only version of the movie.    I hate it when studios double or triple dip but this is one of the few that I would highly highly recommend.  It is now in one of my top 6 fav movies of all time.  Oh the luxury of the DVD.  Right now, mainstream movies in the theatres seem to pander too much to the lowest common denominator and eschewing proper expounding of important movies.  Good thing that we have DVDs.
159562015X|3.0|StrengthsFinder as a whole is wonderful. It's an excellent way to conduct a self-assessment for those of us who have difficulty thinking introspectively without some structure.  Most of us have a vague sense of what our strengths are and tend to focus on our weaknesses.  This concept provides an alternate prospective.  The descriptions are fairly vague; you benefit most when a group of you take the assessment and then have a discussion.    That said...if you've taken the first version of the test, this one will likely be of no use to you.  My strengths remained relatively stable (and the two that changed make complete sense).  The assessment doesn't appear to be upgraded on the user side (perhaps it is behind the scenes...). The customized report is basically the descriptions of the themes pulled from the book and placed in a PDF file. The new information and research was a handful of statistics that, while interesting, can be found in the Q&A with the author above. The website seemed to be a tool to promote Gallup's other (and more expensive) books, products, and services. In fact, that's what this whole book seemed to be.     So the take home message here is buy this if you haven't taken the test previously and borrow a copy of \\"Now Discover Your Strengths\\" (better written and more insightful) from your local library. If you have taken it, pass and review your old book to identify any changes in your top strengths.
0385520298|5.0|The deliberately fractured English of this novel and its engaging, almost breezy style belie its stunning mastery of the form on almost every other level.<br /><br />It's not too much of a stretch to compare Guo with Joseph Conrad or Vladimir Nabokov as writers who have been blessed with the astonishing ability to adopt English, as adults, from their native foreign tongues, and raise it to the level of art.<br /><br />This book can be enjoyed on a number of levels, from that of sheer entertainment, to a worthy example of female bildungsroman.  The more levels you perceive, the more you will appreciate it.<br /><br />Buy it, read it, share it with friends.  We will all be hearing a lot more from and aobut Xiaolu Guo in the future.
0783231202|5.0|Great movie     Painful scenes of the terrible treatment of our African brothers and sisters, and a sad reminder of the brutalities of slavery.
B000001GX5|5.0|This brilliant showpiece CD brings together two separate LPs, the Pines and Fountains of Rome from 1978, the Ancient airs and Dances, along with the Albinoni and Boccherini form 1973. The Albinoni Adagio foretells the immense success of the Karajan Adagio series, which have earned DG millions of dollars. But these fillers are simply lush show-offs for the famous Berlin string sound.<br /><br />the main attraction is Karajan's sumptuous yet refined way with the Pines and Fountains. Frankly, Respighi survives largely because of Toscanini's advocacy, and it would be hard to beat his electrifying accounts of both works, despsite outdated mono sound. The Berlin Phil. is incomparably more viruosic than the NBC Sym., and Karajan's sophisticated way with this second-rate, splashy music may not please everyone. He's out to civilize it, and for many that's exactly the wrong approach. Without its vulgar energy, Respighi's music has little else to offer. (Collectors of the Pines also complain that the nightingale recording used here is too drab. Okay.)<br /><br />For me, owning one version of the Pines and Fountains is more than enough, and I nominate Reiner's famous version in Living Stereo on RCA, an all-out blockbuster. But Karajan's worldly approach is certainly worth a listen for its power and musicality.
B0002XNSY0|1.0|ok, some minimal thrill but not worth spending the time watching it. The so called humor was ineffective. The scene with the cowboy riding the bomb down was a sad reminder of the cowboy diplomacy that's been running the country for 8 years.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Michael Buble has an amazing voice.  This cd, his third full album is another great mix of classics and newer stuff.  The single \\"Everything\\" is enough reason by itself to get the cd.  There is something about that song that is pure joy.  I love listening to it, and singing along with it.  The classic Willie Nelson and Eric Clapton covers are lovely ballads.  What a voice!
B00004XQ83|5.0|We bought this soundtrack CD after seeing the film on TV and were really happy with it.  It is without a doubt one of the best soundtracks for variety and content.  More of the same please!
B000PFU7OO|4.0|Once was a pretty good movie, but it definitely owes its success to the heartfelt and powerful songs on this soundtrack.  The music is raw and emotional, with nothing held back.  It is awesome, especially in the context of the film.  I highly recommend it!
B00138SJ88|1.0|There are no less than 13 editions of this book for the Kindle. Of course I picked the least expensive one and received an e-book where the paragraph spacing is simply messed up. Some paragraphs have 2 to 4 lines of unnecessary white space. It's still legible, but would prefer to pay more for one that's actually typeset correctly.
B00009W0U4|3.0|This film was very effective, or at least certainly affecting.  If you are weak of stomach, either due to violence or motion sickness, stay away from this film.  There are a couple of very disturbing violent scenes in this film unlike anything I've seen before, and I thought I had seen a lot.  The movie keeps you guessing, especially with its backward timeline.  I'd watch it again to try to understand it better, but I don't think I could watch all of it a second time.  On the plus side, the actors give very realistic and powerful performances, and Monica Bellucci is gorgeous.  She looks especially good in the extended nude scene near the end of the film, if you can get through all of the violent mess earlier.
0061122416|3.0|I want to be up front about this book--it is not one I would have chosen to read myself.  The spiritualism and self-help couched in fiction is not a type of novel that appeals to me as a rule.  The simple truth is that I read this because my book group was reading it.  I'm not going to say I was sorry to read it, but I was not overly impressed by it either.<br /><br />Overall, I feel this book suffers from the same problem as many books of its type: fiction forces the philosophy to be to simplistic while the obvious philosophy gets in the way of the fiction.  Add to that the fact that I personally don't find his philosophy to be that appealing.  Following your personal legend is a great concept but I didn't feel our hero's journey left him any better off than staying a shepherd and marrying the merchant's daughter.  Besides, for all of the assertions of personal will needed to achieve the personal legend, our hero would never have come close without serious help every step of the way.  And what does he end up with?  A lot of gold buried near where he started.  Pretty materialist, and Coelho comes awfully close to contradicting his own point.<br /><br />On the other hand, Coelho writes well and this is an easy and pleasant enough book to read.  I also must admit that I like being pushed out of my comfort zone every once in awhile.  How else might we find that hidden gem we never would have come across otherwise?  This just isn't a gem for me.  I know a number of people who have found this book incredibly moving and inspirational.  I would never denigrate what helps another person.  If this is the kind of book that helps you, I have no problem with that.  Enjoy it and I will go back to something that appeals to me a bit more.
B00000DQWT|5.0|I had been searching for this CD for 23 years.  No online service has it available for download, and all I wanted was ONE song on it (the instrumental version of \\"This Is Not America\\", titled \\"Chris\\").  Are rare find, but worth the wait!
B00004SVIK|5.0|Drop dead gorgeously clear live Pink Floyd doing \\"The Wall Live\\" and \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\".  Definitely one of the top live albums of all time.
078322933X|4.0|This is a little known film from the early 90's. The movie takes it's time to flesh out the characters and to build some tension, but when it lets loose, it delivers! Mark Wahlberg gives a very chilling performance as a class 'A' nut job in this above average thriller. It smells like TV, but it's much better than that. Reese Witherspoon and the rest of the cast are very good as well. I rate it 3 1/2 stars.
1400032717|5.0|this book is wonderful, i enjoyed it. it had all my emotions. the book was funny, sad, and at times, mad me a little mad. i loved it.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Wow.  For a Disney cartoon, this sure packs a lot of information into a short 90 minutes.  This is probably the most contemporary of all the Disney films to date with a plot semi-complex for some kids.  Adult will understand it a little more, but as always, Disney's attention to detail and the minutia in their animation is mind-blowing.  Pay particular attention to the cooking utensils and kitchen as well as the panoramic view of Paris.
1932100660|5.0|Everyone must read this book.  It give the scientific reasons behind avoiding milk products.  I knew they weren't good from past experiences but I didn't know to what extent.  I didn't know that the protein in milk has been linked to cancer.      I've raised two children without any dairy who are taller than their peers and have had no need for antibiotics.  A doctor told me to take my first one off of milk when she was 2 due to horrible ear infections.  She's been extremely healthy ever since.
B00005JLT5|5.0|I happen to disagree with David Denby's review.  This is the most moving work I've ever seen; very honest depiction, detail by detail.  It's not meant to be bombastic and dreamy and glorifying.  This is what it was like for Jews during the holocaust.  The waiting.  The boredom.  The uncertainty of the next meal or the uncertainty of the next day.  Watching this movie made me understand a little more clearly the kind of treatment my African-American ancestors went through.  And after watching this movie, I would feel ashamed to waste food.  When you watch this movie, you can't help but thank God we won this one and we've never had it so good.  Congratulations to Mr. Polanksi and Adrien Brody on a job well done.
0425205061|5.0|This is one of the best mysteries I've ever read. The plot, pacing, and characterization are all well done, and the setting was interesting. The surprise ending was completely unexpected. A very good read -- can't wait to pick up some of Child's other books!
B000002868|5.0|This work was one of the first jazz albums I ever purchased, when it came out on vinyl. I knew I had a gem because it had a testimony from the president of Columbia Records, praising it as \\"a classic.\\" I've only grown to appreciate the genius behind 2 cuts especially over the years, Orange Lady and Eurydice. I'm not really one to use superlatives or go heavy on adjectives to describe music but this music always moves me, heart, mind and soul; I love it. Seperately, Mr.s Zawinul, who passed away last year, and Shorter, never achieved the heights they achieved on this album. It really contains a staggering beauty. You must love, and I mean LOVE, jazz, to appreciate this music, especially, to try and understand the freedom effected in Eurydice by the bassist, Miroslav Vitous. If jazz is new to you, consider that it'll take you a few years before you begin to like some cuts. But there's something here for everyone. In time, you'll be glad you made buy. A true work of art.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|I really loved this movie since I saw it on its original release. It was amazing how much of the dialogue I remembered - probably because it IS so memorable, unlike so many scripts today that try so hard for realism they lose all poetry. Sometimes, though, we revisit the epics of our youth and find in them only nostalgia and melodrama. This is not the case here. This is an intelligent epic - mythology rooted firmly in history, and with a heft and sweep impossible to computer generated epics. The scenes are almost stately, yet the human emotion keeps them riveting. No hand-held cameras, quickly cutting from one instant to the next - just characters greater than life, in gorgeous settings, presenting all the drama and sweep of action one could wish for. It didn't matter that I knew absolutely everything that would happen - the joust for Calahorra was still agonizingly suspenseful, and one of the great action sequences ever filmed. Now that I'm old enough to know what really goes into filmmaking, the battle for Valencia was even more staggering in its size and complexity - not just soldiers on walls, but rank upon rank of real people, marcing on a real beach, standing on real walls, in hand-sewn costumes (village women for miles around were kept stitching for months). The landscapes are gorgeous. And above all, there is Miklos Rozsa's music, which is the heart and soul of this epic - you simply cannot imagine \\"El Cid\\" without it.

B000MNP2KI|2.0|When the World is Not Enough came out it was time for the hook (Denise Richards is HOT but she was THE worst Bond girl since Tanya Roberts as the whiny, wimpy Stacy Sutton). I am a self-professed Bond nut - read all the books, own all the movies, except for NSNA (for shame!).  From the opening chase (which went on for far too long) I knew it was going to be a poorly made rip-off the far more superior Bourne films - this movie tries very hard to be like a Bourne movie.  My problem with Craig as Bond is that Craig does not possess the suave yet brutish elegance that Sean Connery possessed - Moore wasn't a bad Bond, he just didn't know how to take a beaten like Connery did.  Craig seemed more like a British soccer hooligan, no class - what next: David Beckham in a Guy Ritchy flick? Moving the locale from France (in the novel) to Montenegro seemed like a good idea, more exotic, more dangerous, but we saw very little of Montenegro. By the way, whose idea was it to make it Texas Hold 'Em!  How American, how crappy! Bond plays chemin de fer, as we all know.  Bond driving a Ford? yeah, right! And since when did Bond go to Oxford? That was the problem I had w/some of the Brosnan films - it was cited in the books, and in the earlier movies, that Bond went to Cambridge. Let's face it: if this didn't have the Bond backing, this movie would have passed silently into the night w/out much ado.  Action scenes were bombastic and larger than life (could this really happen? probably not) no memorable women (Eva Green couldn't hold a candle to Barbara Bach or Diana Rigg), no memorable villains (Le Chiffre crying blood was cool, but what else could he do?) The beating in the chair, though, was good - straight from the book - but Craig overacted and was a bit crass, as he was in the entire movie.  A movie to watch on a rainy day, but definitely not one to return to - I'll save that for Diamonds are Forever or the Man with the Golden Gun.

B0012QE4OO|1.0|It's too bad that a law is not passed in the United States allowing you to get a full ticket refund if you walk out of the theater after watching 50% or less of a movie. A bell could ring or light could flash for a second to remind the patrons of a last call for a refund! If a system like this was in place in the United States, I guarantee you - rotten, boring trash like Jumper would never, ever be made! Half the theater would have emptied out in a heartbeat! This film is so incredibly vapid and mind-numbingly dull it genuinely insults the intelligence of  the movie going audience!!<br /><br />I realize movies actors need to make a living! But big stars like Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of themselves - they can pick and choose their projects. Memo to Their Hollywood Agents: You are ruining their careers! If dreary, campy films are all you can find for them to work on then maybe you shouldn't be in the movie star agent business!<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this godforsaken, awful story! The good guys teleport (A mutant power rip-off from the X-men). The bad guys are religious nuts that kill the teleporters in cold blood because \\"only God should have this power.\\" Simple as that! Each group tries to kill the other. The good guys are all really sexy looking guys and gals in there 20's! All the bad guys are about 20 years older and could be the good guys parents! And in one case, the bad guy is a parent! One of the most memorable lines: \\"When you were five years old I had to either kill you or leave you.

6302787297|4.0|It is utterly unclear to me, what has the editorial found \\"ridiculous\\" about this movie. Yes, the Depardieu's accent is obvious, but I've never had any difficulty understanding his lines. Besides, let's not forget the fact that Columbus wasn't an english as well. The music is simply magnificent. It alone brings at east 3+ stars to the rating. The plot is very dynamic and action-packed. Within two and a half hours we see not one, but two journeys to the West and back. Moreover, due to such limited time, the film shorts some of the developments which could otherwise make it a much deeper, dramatic and touching movie. For that reason I gave it 4 stars. on the other hand, Mr. Marshall Fine, the editorial reviewer, clearly makes an example of ill attitude and politics taking over common sense and objectiveness - the very principles of fair criticism. I'd wonder if he ever passed a highschool.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|300 is a very stylized movie that shows all of the gore of an epic battle.  Watching the blu-ray disc was just like seeing the movie at the theater, with crystal clear detail.  This movie is not for people who are squeamish about violence.  But, if you are interested in what life could have been like in ancient Greece, and you can handle the action, it's great entertainment.

630027120X|5.0|Tom Keogh's editorial review got it wrong. This is a magnificent movie. The background is historically accurate. The music, much of which was written by  South American composers during the 17th century, is flawlessly performed. The story is gripping, and one comes away with an accurate picture of what was going on at the time. It's one of the best movies I've seen in many years.<br /><br />It seems that not many customer reviews agree with Tom Keogh.

B00104W8T6|5.0|This CD is perfect for anyone who loves a classic/indie type vibe. It is definitly a CD that expresses liberal views in a lot of the songs but it is a good CD to dance to or to just hang out to. I love it!

0385338694|5.0|Excellent light read.  Couldn't put it down...more than a 'beach book'...less than a romance novel.  It's real people.  I love the way Kinsella writes.  Samantha's thought process when her life is falling apart is so realistic.  I found myself thinking for Sam...only to read down the page and have those exact words fall out of her mouth! Great read.
B000W10AEI|4.0|I've already seen this movie on regular DVD and it was awesome then. Now it's just icing on the cake to be able to see it on Blu-ray! If you have the right set up then you are in for a treat. It's not perfect I'm sure some of the video file geeks out there can complain about black levels, and color on certain scenes but to my eye (and I'm pretty picky about picture quality) the movie just looked amazing. If you're a Harry Potter fan you owe it to your self to watch them again in Blu-ray.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|When \\"Ratatouille\\" (2007) was released last summer, I was not too eager to see an animated 106 minutes long film about a rat in a kitchen of a five-star Parisian restaurant. The idea seemed too original and brave for my taste. As film had been shown all over the world, I kept reading and hearing only great reviews for it. Then, my brother who usually does not get exited about any movie, told me that \\"Ratatouille\\" was absolutely charming, captivating, funny and moving at the same time, and the most charming about it was Remy, a rat, \\"little chef\\" with huge talent in the fine art of cooking. I saw the movie last weekend and I am happy to agree with my brother completely. \\"Ratatouille\\" has everything for every viewer to enjoy - technical excellence, amazing colors, highly original images, and the voices that matched the characters perfectly. The film is a clever satire and the moving story that will be interesting for the adults and children alike. Where the movie succeeds admirably - in showing on the screen the process of cooking which can be as inspiring and creative as painting, writing, or composing the music: \\"How can I describe it? Good food is like music you can taste, color you can smell. There is excellence all around you. You need only to be aware to stop and savor it.\\" Speaking of how the movies sometimes affect our life - after we saw \\"Ratatouille\\" together with my husband, he demanded that I cooked him a Ratatouille that would take him back to his happy childhood days and rock him to his core just like the one that Remy prepared for a \\"grim eater\\", the universally feared food critic Anton Ego.<br /><br />Not every year, an animated film is nominated for five Academy awards, and I wish \\"Ratatouille\\" victories in every category. It deserves them all.
1582701709|3.0|A very easy to read book full of quotes and concepts you've seen over and over if you follow this genre.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book and would recommend it but as mentioned before if you read in these circles \\"The Secret\\" is really no secret at all.
1591840562|5.0|\\"The Art of the Start\\" ranks as one of the best book around on the subject of startups.  It points any entrepreneur or start up leader in an excellent direction. Like all of Mr. Kawasaki's books I've read, it is very readable, to the point, and filled with invaluable information.  You just have to be at a point in your career/life where your experience allows you to hear Guy's message.  This book applies to any startup - including those that do not wish to pursue VC or other equity financing options.  In fact, Guy makes it abundantly clear that VC may not be worth it for many organizations.    I suspect the bad reviews are from wannabees who haven't been-there or done-that.  It's not a fill-in-the-blank recipe book overflowing with minutia that some reviewers think it should be, but rather it contains a broad message. A guiding principle of sorts.  Mr. Kawasaki cannot hope to convey a clear message if he's spending all his time on the tedium of accounting, product pricing, or marketing details. For example, listen to his message and keep on the right side of the cash curve when bootstrapping.  If you need the details on cash flow, product pricing, margins, and inventory management, then buy a book on the subject.  Or better yet, as Guy suggests, find someone like an angel to help and mentor you.     Good luck and strive to make your mark on the world.

B000ZK4466|5.0|This is what I think every time I read a review that says \\"this is no De-loused...\\" or whatever last album said reviewer thought was their masterpiece.  If you really follow the Mars Volta, then you should come expect NOTHING like the last thing you heard from them.   There are the similar elements that make up a trademark sound but still you would think people know they're not going to hear De-loused, Francis, Amputecture, etc ever again.  What part of progressive do people not get in progressive music?    This album is bloody intense!   Unbridled chaos as the title states.   And that was the concept here.   Right off the bat this album kicks off and doesn't stop, save for some textures trailing a few tracks and of course \\"Tourniquet Man\\".   The latter of which is NOT a bad song.   What gets me is people who appreciated Francis the Mute and Amputecture , both which are relatively filled with quiet, spacious tracks, don't like this song.  It's hardly the first ambient track TMV have ever put out.    As most people have noticed , the new drummer, Thomas Pridgen, is simply nothing short of a ball of pure energy.    From a drummer's stand point , it does seem to be over the top at times.  However Omar's direction is most likely the reason more so than the drummer.   Still it's the most intense drum workout I've heard of any new album in some time that's not from a metal or jazz album.   Certainly if Wax Simulcara makes the radio waves , it'll be the most flamboyant performance of anything you'll hear on pop radio this side of old Rush tracks.      Bedlam is a good mix of more traditional \\"shorter\\" tracks from the De-loused days  with the more complicated, progressive structures from the more recent albums.  Certainly those looking for less drawn out songs will be happier once again with TMV.   That's not to say that you're in for linear song structures by any means.   Metatron almost splits up into 2 very different songs before it's over.   Even if Tourniquet Man isn'tyour forte, there's plenty more to soak in.        Omar recently stated in an interview he sees the next TMV album as more of an \\"acoustic album\\", so if you're looking for a more exciting TMV, this is your album.   And love it or hate it, you know you're not going to hear it like this a second time from TMV.
0452289963|1.0|I actually had already reviewed this book--in a way that I'm sure was neither abusive nor irrelevant.  But that review is gone, so I'll try again.      I bought this as an audio book, listened to half of it, found that it had no relevance to my life, and decided not to finish it.  While I'm highly willing to separate my thoughts and feelings, as has been suggested very rationally by other writers such as Richard Carlson, I am unwilling to spend quite so much effort trying to stop thinking.  I was highly struck by the irony of trying to maneuver through rush hour traffic while being told that my ego was a pathological part of my personality.     It bills itself as helping to awaken you to your life's purpose, but I didn't experience any such revelation.      Basically, if you like Ayn Rand or Atlas Shrugged, you'll find that this book bears a striking resemblance to the works of the character Balph Eubank.  If you happen to like your thinking self, and like the idea of concrete, abstract-free reality, and like the idea of accountability, and don't mind identifying yourself with adjectives and nouns as opposed to suppressing your ego, then this is not the book for you.    If this is the book for you, I'm glad you found something that works.  But I'm really disappointed that my first review was removed when there was nothing wrong with it.  Would Eckhart Tolle support such guerilla tactics?
B000H7I6CU|5.0|I ordered this to use in my Spanish class. Listening in Spanish and using English sub-titles.  It's fun for the kids and they get a little practice picking up on words they recognize. Good reward for all the hard work they do!
0440237688|5.0|This book is wonderful! As I turned the pages of this book, I learned new ideas, thought about stuff that I normally wouldn't have and enjoyed the wonderful story! I enjoyed the idea behind the book: living in a perfect world without pain or feelings...except for one person in the whole town. I think, that living in a world without feeling or pain is not very good. When we live we enjoy or not enjoy things because of how we feel about them. In the town in which the story takes place, it's difficult for me to imagine how people there can enjoy life if they have no feelings about anything. I'm glad that Jonas and the Giver knew about feelings, pain, color, and music.   I read this book all in one day, the moment I picked it up I couldn't put it down! In some of the other reviews, people said they didn't like how Lois Lowry didn't write the ending. But I think that's a wonder of the book, you can make the ending however you want. I recommend this book to everyone older than ten.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|I was told I would love this movie because I am a Beatles fanatic and love the 60s culture.  So like so many others that were miss guided into thinking that a movie worth of being associated with the Beatles was made was sorely disappointed.  The writing was terribly unoriginal, a majority of the songs were butchered to pieces and I felt absolutely no chemistry amongst the cast.   I kept watching hoping for something better to happen but ended up just glad it was finally over.  If you love the Beatles and find yourself in Vegas go see Love because that was one of the greatest shows  have every seen before.
B0002CYPVQ|2.0|My five year old son is obsessed with construction machines.  This toy was the star attraction among his Christmas presents a year ago.  One year later, it was destroyed. The crawler tracks came off and broke.  The body separated from the base.  Hydraulics snapped off of the boom.  It could not stand up to the rigors of play, especially outside in the sand box.  For the price, we expected it to be better made and more durable.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|What a fantastic anthology. I had seen them all, at the cinema but to own them and view at my leisure....WOW! The separate...making of..the films is worth the price alone. It is fascinating to see the \\"special effects\\" before the computer graphics era. Those guys were very ingenious and Giger is beyond genius. My only disappointed was that the set went on sale just after I ordered it and while it was in transet. Still, well worth what I paid.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|I'm usually pleased with both Cate Blanchett and Clive Owen, and they were both extraordinary in this movie. They made it worth watching. [[ASIN:B000RF7XZI Elizabeth [HD DVD]]]was better, but that's hardly surprising. Still, this was enjoyable, if just for the scenes with Owen and Blanchett. I had a few questions about certain details, such as Elizabeth's hair, which wasn't explained in the movie. I wondered why her hair was cut so short and always hidden by wigs, so I looked at her Wikipedia biography. She had smallpox in 1562 which scarred her skin, \\"leaving her half bald and dependent on wigs and cosmetics\\" ([...] And yet I didn't notice any cosmetics - Blanchett's natural beauty is stunning. To continue in this shallow analysis, I liked Clive Owen's rugged look as Sir Walter Raleigh. He doesn't have that \\"pretty boy\\" face but is very masculine.<br /><br />I have to take points off for some of the historical inaccuracy and the wish-washy ending.
0307387178|5.0|I bought this book for my small junior English class in hopes of encouraging the students to enjoy reading and Language Arts. I read it when I was a junior in high school and fell in love with reading and writing as a result. I wanted my students to experience the same thing.     The story of Christopher McCandless strikes a chord with many students as they debate the reasons why he did what he did and whether he was justified in leaving his family behind. They are also fascinated by the idea of someone young venturing out on his own, giving up all of his possessions, and pursuing what makes him happy--life on the road and life in the wild. Krakauer's writing style draws readers in as they seek to understand how all the side stories connect to tell a fuller story of McCandless, in hopes of understanding what motivated him.     I recommend this book for teachers, students, and anyone who wants to explore what motivates individuals to pursue what makes them happy, no matter the cost.

B000R7HY0K|3.0|Death Proof has all the hallmarks of a Quentin Tarantino movie. The moment the dialogue kicks in you could swear that the master behind Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs is back on form. In fact, for the first half of this movie, he is, and fans will be very happy that the Tarantino they remembered and loved is back on top form.<br /><br />However, while the second half of the movie contains some interesting performances, for a film that virtually has an all-girl cast, it doesn't match up to the spectacular first hour which is full of hilarious gags (like comments about Stuntman Mike's scar being the result of him falling out of his time machine) and the most violent car crash scene in the history of motion picture smash ups.<br /><br />In a way Death Proof plays more as an ode to movies about cars than it does a Grindhouse B-Movie feature. While that style is presented well for the first hour (jump cuts, dirty reels, hammy direction [that's actually really good], new title replacing the original name of the film, bad edits, bad cuts, bad hairdos) Tarantino looses the feel in the second half, devoting most of his time to a car stunt that is over long and a car chase that is nothing spectacular, with an ending that doesn't really sit well. When it's all over you get the feeling that he would have been better off doing the second half like he did the first half for a much more satisfying road rage film. Maybe watch the first half twice instead.
B000WTNCQS|2.0|The bonus DVD (Paris concert) is the only appreciable thing of this bundle, not their best performance (Streets is missing!) but it is much better than what filmed in Rattle & Hum.  \\"Outside it's America\\" is just complete and utter rubbish, really pathetic patchwork.  Audio CDs are remastered but audio quality is as poor as in the original album.
B000000OU0|5.0|Have been an Eagles fan since the beginning, was at the Houston concert the last time they played there in '81, and think they have a sound that will stay with us the same as the Big Band Era (swing).  They sound as good today in this album as they did back then and their lyrics and music are as crisp and grabbing as it was back in time.  Great music to travel by.
B000RJO578|4.0|Fun, easy watching movie. It's a comedy that pays homage to tons of other movies, so different people will appreciate it (or hate it) in different ways.  Clean enough for kids, but they wouldn't understand it.

B000O5AYCA|5.0|In a year of otherwise rather bland pop music, this is a shining star.<br /><br />We were figuring on being disappointed. Alligator was really good, but dark. We knew that Boxer was getting the big push. Although happy for a band that's been out there struggling a long time, often the 'sell out' album is somewhat uninspired - trite.<br /><br />So, it was a double pleasure listening to this brooding and soulful work. In fact, I found it more enjoyable over time. It is a solid record - my favourites are constantly being rearranged.
0316113506|5.0|This is a book that every educator, every teacher, every parent, every school board member and administrator AND every student should read.    It's about time that we became cognizant of how learning takes place neurologically and build teaching around the science.  5,000 years ago, the Greeks knew that mind and body were one and that exercise was wholly integrated with \\"learning.\\"     Finally we have the research to put the science into education and get the politics out.  Kudos to Dr. John Ratey for writing the most meaningful and important book in American education.

B0010ZR160|3.0|The first half of Gone Baby Gone was as good as movies get.  The story of a young girl's kidnapping and the man that gets hired to find her was set up perfectly.  The neighborhood where this story takes place and the people that live there all seem very ugly and real.  Unfortunately, roughly the last half of this movie turns into a disappointment.  This is one of those self-important movies that tries to make you think about right and wrong, and how you might react in a similar situation.  The only problem is that the situation is lame.  Basically, the question is whether kidnapping is right or wrong.  Is this really debatable?<br /><br />I must mention that the acting in this movie was excellent.  Casey Affleck was actually tolerable in this movie, and Ed Harris, as always, is worth watching the movie.  I almost gave this movie 4 stars based on the performances, but the movie as a whole just disappointed me.

B000YY677W|5.0|Universal Japan has issued three top selling Stones albums so far on their new SHM disc.A new material was developed by Universal and JVC to have their music pressed on, bust still costing the same as a 'normal' cd. These discs are said to have the best available audio quality. I did compare them to the SACD version released in 2002 and the Japanese DSD paper sleeve version released in 2006. Beggar's Banquet in this format is the best sounding cd ever available, better than the 2002 SACD version, hard to believe but true. For this release the DSD master was used , and for the first time music seems to come from the room, not the speakers.There is depth, there is spacing, Mick Jagger's voice is loose and clearly to locate. Location seems the right word to use. I have a Marantz SA15S SACD player hooked on an Accuphase E-308 Amp and Tannoy D-700 speakers. I tend to switch a lot between my Beggar's Banquet cd's, but this time it stayed in my cd player.  So the winning version to buy  is 1. SHM cd from Japan 2. paper sleeve edition Japan[ get them while you can] and 3. SACD [ out of print]. Surprised? I was, at least!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Richard Kelly's quirky \\"Donnie Darko\\" was an audience-pleaser at Sundance then a bomb at the box office in 2001 before becoming a cult hit on DVD. It isn't clear what kind of film it's trying to be, which is part of the problem and part of the attraction. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a high school student whose life is disrupted by sleepwalking and hallucinations of someone named Frank wearing a grotesque bunny suit. On October 2, 1988, the bunny tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 6 seconds. That would be on Halloween. It's assumed that Donnie is mentally ill. He doesn't know himself. Between the bunny's commands and other bizarre incidents, Donnie begins to think it all has something to do with time travel, which will come to an abrupt end on October 31.<br /><br />Donnie is a thoughtful young man with a problem of unclear dimensions. He's trying his best to figure it all out, so the audience roots for him. Richard Kelly places \\"Donnie Darko\\" in the science fiction genre. But it's also satire, family dramedy, teen romance, and a period film of the 1980s. This works, because different themes are compartmentalized, and when they intersect, they do so naturally. The satire involving a gym teacher (Beth Grant) who idolizes a puritanical motivational speaker (Patrick Swayze) is over-the-top. The family dynamic is sincere and good-natured. Mary McDonnell is particularly touching as Donnie's mother, who feels her son's pain and reacts with respect and kindness. But there is a nagging feeling that things in Middlesex, Virginia are somehow out of whack.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2003): On the standard disc, NOT the director's cut, the bonus features are a theatrical trailer and 5 TV spots, selected filmographies of 11 cast and 9 crew members, 20 deleted or extended scenes with optional commentary, \\"Mad World\\" music video performed by Gary Jules (3 min), a web site gallery that features documents that fill out the past and future of some characters, liner notes for the soundtrack, \\"Cunning Visions\\" infomercials (6 min) with optional commentary by the company's fictional CEO and director, Cunningham's full \\"His Name is Frank\\" presentation, Cunningham's book covers, an Art Gallery with nearly 50 production stills and 27 pieces of concept art from the film, and 12 pages of \\"The Philosophy of Time Travel\\" by Roberta Sparrow.<br /><br />There are also 2 audio commentaries. The first is by writer/director Richard Kelly and actor Jake Gyllenhaal.

The second audio commentary is by 8 (I think) members of the cast and Richard Kelly. They are a friendly bunch, conversing with the director and each other about the film, commenting on the scenes.

B0012QE4OO|1.0|Thank God this was a short movie - what a waste of money. The story's ridiculous and largely untold - there are gaping holes in the plot, the backstory is nonexistant apart from a throwaway line (\\"this dates back to the Inquisition\\" ... eh???) You get the feeling sometimes when novels are made into films that you're getting the story through a filter, getting it all 2nd or 3rd hand. This is a prime example, but its problems didn't stop there. The acting was just abysmal - Sammuel Jackson was completely unsuited to this role in the first place, and sure enough he made a mess of it. Rachel Billison was just shrill and annoying, constantly (CONSTANTLY) demanding to know what was going on - seriously, that was the extent of her dialogue: \\"What's going on? What aren't you telling me? Blah blah, wah wah!\\" Some character. There is no character development at all, least of all Jamie Bell's, who is similarly annoying and unlikeable.    Terrible script, terrible plot (what plot?) A real bottom of the barrel stinker. I walked out of the cinema baffled at what I'd just witnessed ... someone actually forked out millions to make this film. It defies belief.

0394818237|5.0|I have a 4 year old and a 1 year old, and I'm ordering another copy of this because the first is already worn out and ripped. If you have a curious child or want your child to be curious, then this is the book for you.  Younger kids like to look at the pictures, and I read the text to the older one. This book and \\"Cars and Trucks and Things that Go\\" are his favorites and have been since about age two.  We have many many Richard Scarry books and videos and they're all a hit.
B000H7JCIW|5.0|I was one of the ones lucky enough to see this show live at Radio City! This is Liza at her best!!! Just absolutely awesome! I already owned this on VHS, and was so thankful that it has finally been released on DVD. This DVD does not have any extra features on it...just LIZA...and let me tell you, this performance speaks for itself! Liza and her Demon Divas put on one heck of a show!The show starts off kind of slow, unless you are a Liza fan like I am...then she starts singing Stepping Out and all people in the audience are glued to some crazy lady interrupting the show...What happens then is just one great production number with the Demon Divas and Liza.<br /><br />Get this DVD while it is still available...you will not regret it!
006135323X|5.0|I had the privilege of taking Dan's class at Duke last fall, where all of us got the chance to read preview copies of Predictably Irrational.  Of course, not everyone will get the chance to hear Dan's excellent lectures, but the book does a great job of capturing his wit while providing a wealth of information about why human behavior can be as fallible as it is.    The joy in this material lies in the fact that every few pages you will find yourself smiling because you too have behaved in the irrational manner being described, and now that you look back on it, it's hard to remember why.      Why are we so excited about free stuff, even if we just throw it out later?  Do we convince ourselves that an expensive meal will taste better than a cheap one?  And why are we motivated to act on some humanitarian disasters, but not others?  We all make irrational decisions at times, but this book provides the rare opportunity to reflect on those decisions and observe the behavioral patterns underneath.    If you enjoyed Freakonomics or any of Malcolm Gladwell's writings, you will also enjoy Predictably Irrational.  The pace is quick, and nearly every page contains some nugget of surprising information that you'll want to tell your friends.  It is more like Freakonomics than Blink or The Tipping Point in that it is structured around experiments, with each chapter covering the results of experiments in a specific area of irrational behavior, the implications for society, and what individuals might do to mitigate it.    It's a hard book to put down, and it's both entertaining and interesting from start to finish.  For those who are curious about the world, this might be the ultimate beach or airline reading!
B00006EXDM|3.0|Between 1964 and 1971, the Rolling Stones made some of the most un-friggin'-believable rock `n' roll music of all time. Their raw, sweaty fusion of blues, country, soul, and rock, all of it united under Mick Jagger's sullen grimace and Keith Richards' (not to mention Brian Jones'!) barnburning guitar work gave the world of popular music that raucous kick in the drawers that it had been craving since Elvis was drafted and Chuck Berry went to prison (hey, four years is a long time in rockworld!). Their music was full of anger and sex, full of joy and singalong catharsis and booze-soaked attitude, and it positively ruled.     And this collection aims to sum that sound up. If you're just getting introduced to the `Stones, it presents itself as a pretty darn good introduction: It's got a lot of the big hits (\\"Satisfaction,\\" \\"Time Is On My Side,\\" \\"Under My Thumb,\\" etc.) in one place, with cool cover art to boot. If you're a beginner, it allows you to temporarily sidestep their first few albums, which a lot of people think are spotty and inconsistent. Plus, it has a few songs that were only released as singles, never appearing on a proper album, such as \\"Honky Tonk Woman.\\" Good deal, right?    Well, sure, it's a very good deal. If you're a beginner, you should pick this up. I mean, there's no such thing as a bad album that has \\"Get Off Of My Cloud\\" or \\"Heart Of Stone\\" on it. But here's the thing: This album doesn't have \\"The Last Time.\\" Or \\"Not Fade Away.\\" Or \\"Tell Me.\\" Or \\"It's All Over Now.\\" Those are all fantastic songs, and no aspiring `Stones fan should be without them (especially \\"The Last Time.\\" Excluding that song was a stunningly weird idea). You know what collection does have those songs on them, though? Big Hits (High Tide And Green Grass). It's a single disc collection that brings together a bunch of the stuff from their first few albums. It doesn't cover as wide a period as this collection, but a lot of the songs on Hot Rocks come from albums like Beggar's Banquet and Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers, and nobody thinks that those records are spotty. Nobody who counts, anyway. You're gonna wanna get those albums early on, so getting a collection with songs from those albums is a bit redundant. Just a thought.    So, this album is full of great music, and if you're getting introduced to the Rolling Stones, you'll probably like it a lot. I recommend getting the Big Hits record, though. After that, pick up Aftermath, Beggar's Banquet, et al. Have fun! (If you like good music, you certainly will)
0385341067|4.0|You can read this deceptively slight volume in 4-6 hours, depending upon how many breaks you need or allow yourself, but you should be prepared to want to follow it through to the end once you begin it.     To fully enjoy and appreciate the characters and themes, you should have at least a rudimentary knowledge of Dickens and Great Expectations, so if you're not prepared to read the original, either abridged or unabridged, then at least rent and watch one of the many fine films before you make your foray into this novel. (I kind of prefer the early 1940's black and white version myself).     You will be engrossed and gripped by the force of the narrative of the major portion of this work, at the tension between Matilda and her mother, between her mother and her teacher, and between Matilda and her own conscience and sense of loyalty. But be prepared for swift brutality    that is all the more horrifying because it is presented in simple and unadorned language. Bring along your sense of irony, too.    It's  the last 15-20 pages of this novel that weaken it because those pages function more as an unnecessary epilogue. That's not a reason to dismiss the title, however. The notion of re-inventing oneself through education and leaving behind, even \\"improving on\\" a former self is particularly American, notwithstanding the curious fact that this author is from New Zealand and the novel is set on a tropical Pacific island. Dickens's original Mr. Pip, of course, is British, perhaps a nascent and  callow precursor to our Great Jay Gatsby, the quintessential reinvented American self.    This is a great little read for book groups and 11th and 12th graders who have had some intro to Great Expectations, or who could be coaxed into reading it after seeing its influence on the characters in this poor island schoolhouse. Would also make an interesting companion piece to Lord of the Flies.     You may well feel wrung out after your evening's read, but you will certainly not soon forget the characters, the events, and the themes of this work. Well worth the time you will spend seeing Matilda through to the novel's end.

She is told that her heart was damaged though, and she has about a week to live.  During this time she meets other people comited to this hospital, who do make a contribution to her life, she learns to live like this is the last day of her life, and discovers she now desires to live, so this is what unfolds here.  Amazing story who leads to self discovery and to find new meaning to our lives as well as promting us to pursuing dreams that we think are out of our reach, after all what have we got to lose, is better to try reaching our dreams even if they seem improbable than not trying at all.  Living life like an adventure may get us out of our comfort zone, but what is that compared to living a dull life only so that we feel safe!  This book also talks about going deep inside of us, facing all of our feelings, whether we like them or not, not being afraid to have a good look at ourselves, bringing Light to all that we are, otherwise, whatever we are not willing to face can come back to destroy us.  Great book, another Coelho's book that you cannot stop reading until you get to the end!!!

B00000DI2T|3.0|The obvious advantage of this collection lies in its emphasis upon the wholeness and unity of Mahler's music. It is as if there existed no difference between the symphonies and the orchestral songs - text and music belong to one and the same universe. The drawback lies in the mixed quality of Bernstein's interpretations. The vocal artists are outstanding, but he is more or less whipping them to the point of the bizarre, as in \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\", which is not only casted with two male voices (!) but where poor Fischer-Dieskau has to race through some parts of the text like Rossini's dr. Bartolo, whereas Bernstein hounds the orchestra to sound like a panicking menagerie. The same goes for the eighth symphony (recorded in 1975, long before the other ones): Bernstein, the orchestra, the choirs and the soloists are running like a whole hunting-party through the first movement, pantingly slowing down in the second one into an almost sluggish tempo. The choir finale of the second symphony is somewhat theatrically interpreted, which fits with the romantic piece as a whole; the third symphony is otherwise good, but wrecked by the children's choir in the fifth movement (they are not singning, they are screaming). The purely orchestral symphonies 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 keep impressing, though Bernstein maintains the old order of the 2d and 3d movements in no. 6 and ruins the end of the 7th symphony (on the other hand, he also skips through the too overtly outdrawn Tchaikowsky-like ending of the 1st symphony). The \\"Knaben Wunderhorn-\\" \\"Rückert-\\" and \\"Kindertotenlieder\\" are all beautifully interpreted: Thomas Hampson is, of course, outstanding, as is my personal favorite Lucia Popp, and Andreas Schmidt vividly illustrates the contains of the Wunderhorn texts; but these recordings can be bought separately, and there is no need for the box. To sum it up, the collection seems to be a curse more than a blessing, for the coherent world of Mahler is disrupted by the personality of Bernstein. For fans of the latter, it is certainly a \\"must\\" - Mahler fans will have to create their own personal collections, possibly lamenting that the great man did not live to see the dawn of music recordings.

It is a great source of information for everybody enchanted by the world of beauty, professionals and amateurs, biginners and advanced.

B000RGSOR8|5.0|She's been a part of the Polyphonic Spree's twee orchestra, toured with Sufjan Stevens, and many other bands as well, ranging from the Arcade Fire to Xiu Xiu.<br /><br />So it wasn't entirely clear what style Annie Clark (aka St. Vincent) would embrace in her solo debut, \\"Marry Me.\\" But she does a brilliant job with what she does choose -- a swirling, multifaceted brand of lush indiepop, crammed with quirky instrumentals and charmingly witty little lyrics. It's absolutely stunning.<br /><br />It kicks off with \\"Now Now,\\" a catchy little dulcimer-wrapped tune. Clark sings that she's not a carpet, an atomic bomb, a dog, and that: \\"You don't mean that say you're sorry/You don't mean that I'll make you sorry...\\" as the strings and drums rev up. She follows it up with the whimsical \\"Jesus Saves, I Spend,\\" a distinctively quirky pop tune punctuated by babyish noises, smooth keyboard and solid powerpop riffs.<br /><br />But the album's tone changes drastically with \\"Your Lips Are Red,\\" which the Dresden Dolls wouldn't be ashamed off -- tortured violins, plunking cabaret piano, erotic overtones and \\"cities black from all the ashes in downtown.\\" After that, the album slips down into gentler, more lush pop tunes -- quirky romantic ballads, rainy piano tunes, swirling pop epics, and ends with a couple of springtime anti-folk songs.<br /><br />The best song: \\"Paris is Burning,\\" a swaying Weimar-styled mass of horns, synth and strings -- it seems to be from the POV of a slain WWII soldier. \\"We are waiting on a telegram to give us news of the fall/I am sorry to report dear Paris is burning after all/We have taken to the streets in open rejoice revolting/We are dancing a black waltz, fair Paris is burning after all...\\"<br /><br />If you listen carefully, you can hear a few hints of various musical influences in \\"Marry Me\\" -- moments where St. Vincent's musical experience is briefly glimpsed. But most of the time, she sounds like Regina Spektor and Feist by way of Arcade Fire -- she has a unique blend of quirky, offbeat instrumentation and lyrics, and lush melodies infused with bossa nova, folk, pop, and a bit of rock.<br /><br />Of course, that quirkiness could have rendered this album totally twee and irritating. But Clark does a brilliant job wringing catchy melodies studded with odd moments (is she throttling that guitar?), and even though the second half is far quieter and less experimental than the first, it's still a magnificent little experience.<br /><br />St. Vincent -- who played virtually everything on here -- somehow softens the sputtery bass, drums and electric guitars with a web of gauzy dulcimer, handclaps, synth, xylophone, trickling piano, and occasionally a shifting wall of strings. So much is layered into this that they should sound dense, but instead they sound ethereal and effortless.<br /><br />And Clark's sweetly powerful voice does the music justice, flipping from joyously wicked to sweetly romantic in a moment, and backing herself with an oddball chorale -- sometimes she sounds like a child, an angel, or a bunch of radio-broadcast imps. And her brilliant songs have their bleak moments -- like the Shakespearean \\"come sit right here and sleep/while I slip poison in your ear\\" -- but more often, her focus is on love's sorrows and joys. Mostly joys. \\"Collect the love that I've been given/build a nest for us to sleep in here...\\" she sings meditatively.<br /><br />\\"Marry Me\\" is the pop debut that most singers can only dream of -- exquisitely beautiful, alluring and quirky.

B000YXMMAE|3.0|When i first put this in and played it i was a bit disappointed in the first two tracks. But by the third track onwards the album grew in strength and mood, and lets  just say it is moody. In particular i prefer the slower songs which make up most of the album.  A song like Weird Fishes has almost jazzlike clean guitar tones and structure- not something entirely new for Radiohead but its really a great effort. I found Reckoner- All i need and Nude also great songs with Videotape nearly there but i almost felt that song could have done without the stumbling drum pattern which ruined the mood for me. In Rainbows is basically a collection of styles and songs from their last 7 years or so- closer to Kid A mixed abit with Hail to the thief- its not mind-blowingly great but its very good for a band  this late into their career. As i noted i didnt find the first two songs anything special and the packaging is pretty useless. There are also times when the drumming is rather boring and Thom's vocals seem too whiny or grating but when Radiohead get it right as they do on the majority of this album it makes for a worthwhile and attentive listen.  Ps- its especially more potent at night or nightdrives alone.
B0000EZII0|4.0|Britpop is always swarming over the pond, in different incarnations -- retro rock, mellifluous pop, whatever.<br /><br />But Muse has something special -- this magnificent young band is perhaps the most powerful Britpop band to emerge in years. If you want comparisons, they're equal parts Radiohead and Led Zeppelin, with a unique sound that is both melodic and raw. Few debuts are as intense as Muse's \\"Showbiz.\\"<br /><br />A steady piano melody ripples by, followed by some steady drumming. That, in turn, segues into the expansive bombastic rock'n'roll of \\"Sunburn.\\" Matt Bellamy sits in the middle of the song, singing in a trembly voice, \\"I'll feel/A guilty conscience grow/And I'll feel/A guilty conscience grow.\\" Then he bursts into an anguished howl: \\"And I'll hide from the world/Behind a broken frame/And I'll run forever/I can't face the shame...\\" The music crests with it, a panoramic blend of guitar, bass and piano.<br /><br />And that's only the first song.<br /><br />The songs that follow are just as powerful, if a bit lower-key. Muse dabbles first in some truly ominous guitar pop, followed by acoustic ballads, and an angsty lament or two. Then, about halfway through the album, things get loud again -- songs like the title track have a wall-of-sound guitar'n'bass melody. In these songs, Muse sounds eerily like a British version of the Smashing Pumpkins.<br /><br />Good as their debut was, Muse wasn't at their peak with \\"Showbiz\\" -- they hadn't quite perfected the epic-guitar thing, and the production isn't at its best. But they are still a compelling listen -- the climax of \\"Uno\\" is the sonic equivalent of being hit with a tsunami. For a band that was still defining their sound, it's remarkable.<br /><br />Chris Wolstenholme does an exceptional job with the driving bass, while Bellamy pulls double, triple and sometimes quadruple duty, playing everything from Hammond to piano. His roiling guitar riffs are absolutely stunning. It takes a special drummer to have an impact with all of that going on, and fortunately Dominic Howard is up to the task.<br /><br />Bellamy also is the vocalist, and here he shines. Too often comparisons are made to Radiohead's frontman Thom Yorke. However, Bellamy's vocals are more versatile -- he starts off in a sort of trembly voice, sounding sad and vulnerable. Then he lets rip with anguished howls, purrs, murmurs and much more. And he does it in perfect harmony to the music.<br /><br />With their epic sound and excellent musicianship, Muse have the makings of a rock'n'roll legend. \\"Showbiz\\" was their first album and it shows, but even with its flaws, it's a stunning piece of work.y Dominic Howard is up to the task.

Wayne Dyer, Norman Vincent Peale, Jon Kabat-Zinn, A.C. Ping, Andrew Matthews, Norman Cousins, the Tao and Bible studies teach most of the things contained in this book.<br /><br />Living in the now and not worrying about the past or the future is healthy. It is true enough that positive thinking and doing for others for altruistic reasons is the path to happiness as opposed to the accumulation of things and self-aggrandizement. Likewise, concentrating on the task at hand with joy and enthusiasm is the correct formula for a happier life.<br /><br />The Pain-Body stuff in chapters 5 and 6 are original theory, but is not very convincing or useful theory.<br /><br />The idea that there is something that the reader falls short of if this book does not spark enlightenment is presumptive on the author's part. It is thought provoking though.<br /><br />This book is very interesting, but it is not worthy of all of the hype.

159562015X|2.0|As one who is intrigued by self-assessment and always looking for ways to improve myself, I was drawn to a test that could give me more insight into myself.  I found, however, that like other poorly-designed instruments, Strengthsfinder only measures what I think about myself.  If I think I am empathic and answer the questions as I see myself, the result is that I must be empathic--whether or not I actually have this strength or am just deluding myself!  I learned little about myself and had little that was actionable to improve upon after reading this book.  A disappointment.
B00005V9IL|2.0|I love this movie. It's hard to think of a better masterpiece from the 1980s. It's just too bad I bought this version -- older DVDs like this one have some problems with playback on modern widescreen TVs. Without using the TV's \\"zoom\\" feature (which basically makes the image larger to fit the screen, but reduces resolution drastically), you have to watch the movie in a truncated box within the screen. There is no true 16:9 output from the disc itself.     It is indeed presented in \\"widescreen\\" format, but the movie plays in a 4:3 setting which shrinks the image to fit within 4:3-sized box in your 16:9 monitor. Not the best way to watch a great movie. I'll have to wait for a Blu-Ray version when I finally upgrade to hi-def.    That aside, the extended version of the film is included along with the standard version. But there are almost no special features at all.
B00005JPXY|5.0|*spoilers ahead*    Even though is shorter than other monster movies, I found it entertaining enough. You can feel more the excitement of the story, because is filmed in in a style like if you where there filming everything with your camara  and that gives the movie more sense of realism. The movie has a couple of fun material and the audio is pretty good. And is nice to find a monster movie which has secondary monster characters, in this case, those giant ticks(or parasites, Im not quite sure) which the monster was dropping around.   The scarier part is the fact that the monster is actually a newborn.  as you can see I will be buyng this DVD and Im glad that I've commed to that decision.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|Upon hearing \\"Skinny Love\\", probably the most accessible song on \\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\", it was running through my head the rest of the week as I played it over and over again.  This should in no way denigrate the rest of the album, which packs a surprising punch in 9 subtle songs.  It would be easy to just treat \\"For Emma...\\" as background music, but a careful listen reveals layers of melody overlaid by Justin Vernon's impressive vocals.      \\"The Wolves (Act I and II)\\" starts off slowly but builds into a powerful message at the album's core:   What might have been lost  Don't bother me  The title track \\"For Emma\\" further embellishes on what might have been lost with a mixture of trumpet and strained guitar.  The crooning of \\"Creature Fear\\" builds into the wonderfully moody instrumental \\"Team\\".      It is often mentioned that this album was written over the course of 4 wintry months in a Wisconsin cabin.  Stereotyping the quiet solitude of this album on its origins is unfair, however: this isn't just one of those singer/songwriter efforts you hear about some guy writing on his own out in the woods; it is the epitome of a singer/songwriter recording the heartfelt musings of life in isolation.      I highly recommend this album--it's subtle tones on first listen grow into brilliance.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This is the best Limp Bizkit album ever. I suggest you buy this 100%. I received it about an houre ago in great condition and only one day after the estimated shipping date, and have been skimming through it to find that it is great. I'm listening to it as I type, and I've got to say: \\"Just Like This\\", \\"Nookie\\", and the reason I bought the disc, \\"Break Stuff\\", \\"I'm Broke\\", \\"No one like you\\", and \\"Trust\\" are excellent songs, although every song on here is truly a masterpiece and are all reasons to buy the album in themselves. I reccommend Significant Other over any other Limp Bizkit album (there's too many to name).      Now I'd like to talk about the liner notes and the album cover. The album cover is a graffitti-looking picture of a Rapper (or a gangster?) I believe to be drawn by Wes as he does mostly all of the band's artwork. The liner NOTES get a 2/5. The lyrics are very hard to read as they are over a big picture of either the whole band or an individual band member, and the acknowledgements (While interesting to read) are in various prints ranging from standard/default typing font to \\"cursive-like\\" that will actually make you strain your eyes if you try to read.      Parents: The language used on this album is quite strong, especially on \\"Break Stuff\\", \\"Truth\\", and \\"9 Teen 90 nine\\", so consider before you go buy this for your 14-year old.      Aknowledgements go to: MTmannix who delivered it in great condition and a week before the estimated arrival date.       I also recommend:      3 Dollar Bill, Y'all      Greatest Hitz      &      Chocolate Starfish and the Hot-Dog Flavored Water (which I have mixed opinions about)          BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B000W04S6U|4.0|The Halo 3 soundtrack was an amazing 2 Disc set that did recapture the game. The few bad parts of the set was that Martin O'Donnell redid a little too much and didn't add enough original work. And he also didn't include one track from the game that appears on the final stage Halo when walking up the ramps to where Guilty Spark opens the door. I was pretty angry because I loved that track but other than that, the music included on the CD's was outstanding and definitely captured my attention.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I have been listening to metal since 1992. I was only 5 then. You name a metal band, I have probably heard them and can engage in discussion with you about them. And out of all the metal bands I have heard/seen, very few were not influenced by Iron Maiden. This band is the god of metal and in my opinion, and in the opinion of many others, they invented metal.    Now that I have established a background, I should talk about his CD : )    Like in most albums, not all the songs in this album are great. I would say \\"Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\" and \\"Fallen Angel\\" are not masterpieces, but they are still very good. The other songs are pretty much amazing. You will, or should, instantly fall in love with \\"The Wicker Man\\", \\"Blood Brothers\\", \\"Brave New World\\", and \\"Dream of Mirrors\\". Those are Maiden classics. They are brilliantly composed, and if you are a guitar player, they are really fun to pick up! \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and \\"The Nomad\\" take a while to grow on you, but are equally great songs. The composition and variety they present are definitely worth every minute you spend analyzing them!    Overall, this CD is amazing. I highly recommend it. This album is equally attractive to non-metal listeners as well.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I like Bon Jovi.  This CD is a bit more mellow than his usual music, but it is quite nice all told.  Hard core rock persons will probably not like it as much but for some of us older folk, it is great.
0823016714|4.0|Being an animator, I found this book very helpful.   Different type of people express themselves in a different way.   you can have so many variety of facial expressions using these references.  It's helpful also for storyboard artists.
B0010ZR160|4.0|I thought this was a really good movie.  It was well acted and scripted.  Its been a while since I have seen Ed Harris in anything.  He is always great.  This movies has some turns you don't expect.  Defintely worth watching,
B0013AWUFO|5.0|the music on this soundtrack is so hot. it has so many major artists. i love it!!
B001041JLE|5.0|I just bought this and I am really impressed.<br />The CD is amazing, the songs are still awesome, the remixes sound even better on a stereo than my laptop and the DVD (although I own all of the content) is still awesome to watch!<br />The only thing that disappointed me was the packaging, yes it looks really nice and cool, but I expected something a bit more inside. I expected when purchasing this DELUXE CASEBOOK EDITION, a big booklet with really cool liner notes and information.<br />All I got was a bunch of photos from the Thriller era, pretty much filled up with photos from the Thriller video! It also comes with lyrics which is great but to be honest, I was disappointed with the inside content of Thriller 25.<br />I am only disappointed however because I had 2001's \\"Thriller: Special Edition\\" and its not identical but it isnt a far departure from what that looked like. This is probably the inner-packaging-nerd speaking, but yeah, I expected a bit more from this \\"deluxe\\" release.<br />The content however is freaking awesome. I love the \\"Thriller\\" album and anyone who doesnt own one copy (in any form) should be ashamed!!<br />Hahaha, anyways I really recommend this, to anyone, the content is first rate and the DVD will leave a smile on your face.<br />The remixes sound really good and the only one I didnt love so much was Fergie's \\"Beat It\\"..the rest are great.<br />Great re-release and I cant wait to hear Michael's new material!<br />Content:<br />Original Album - A+++<br />Extras + Remixes - A<br />Packaging - A+ for outside, B for inner booklet!
0060558121|5.0|I picked this book off the shelf without knowing anything about it. This book was well written and full of twists and turns. At times, a couple of the scenes seemed gratuitous - just shock value for the sake of shock value - but from start to finish it was a great read. I had trouble putting it down. If you have even a passing interest in mythology this is a great book.
B00139W3NE|5.0|For everyone who has disregarded these books or movie on the premise that it is anti-god needs to quit believing the he said she said BS. Yes in the books the current religious organization (the magisterium)is evil and trying to take over all the galaxies, but that does not mean their is no god, but rather the organized religion people have come to believe is evil, and that you should question your religion from time to time as not to fall short of gods graces. Phil pullman wrote his books against the narnia books, because the narnia books were way to biblical, and he wanted something that could make people look harder at things and be more creative.<br /><br />Lets face it alot of religion right now is soo far from the original source, that we all need to question it, and that is what phil pullmans view was on it, and that is surprising because he was an atheist and you would have thought he would be preaching that, but he doesnt.<br /><br />Bottom line read the books for yourself and you will be quite surprised how good of books they are much like the narnia books, and yes the harry potter series.
B000002ARV|5.0|Man does Johnny Winter fire on all cylinders on this one, or what!  This album is non-stop energy, front to back, and just an all around rockin' good time.<br /><br />Covers of B.B. King's \\"Rock Me Baby\\" and The Rolling Stones' \\"Let it Bleed\\" play well as bookends on an album that's chock full of great tunes, as Winter's playing breathes new life into these songs.<br /><br />This is a can't miss album for blues fans and rock fans.  Top notch!
B0000024W3|5.0|I'll tell you, Rolling Stone Magazine. This s*@t is the epoch of Dylan's great run of 1960s albums. The thing is, hippies and the critics at the time hated this album. And why? Because Dylan wasn't being overtly existential or singing songs that were socially relevant. Heck, many of them were covers! How dare he!? How dare he not be fashionable!? Paul McCartney's wonderful RAM album suffered a similar condemnation. Apparently, the squarest thing you could do at the break of the 1970s was just make well constructed, exceedingly pleasant music to listen to. I mean, why LISTEN to music when you can sit around, passing a joint, and decipher it with your college boy friends? The fact that an album as good-natured, human and sublime as SELF PORTRAIT couldn't bring a smile to these hippies and critics proves there was something missing in them...and NOT in Dylan. This IS a self portrait of the artist at the time: Showing all his different sides and moods. There are lush orchestrated experiments in minimalism (\\"All The Tired Horses\\", \\"Wigwam\\"), NASHVILLE SKYLINE style country tunes (\\"I Forget More Than You'll Ever Know\\", \\"Take Me As I Am\\"), campfire folk songs (\\"Alberta\\"), hillbilly knee-slappers (\\"Little Sadie\\"), boogie-woogie jams (\\"Woogie Boogie\\"), sweet soulful ballads (\\"Let It Be Me\\", \\"Belle Isle\\"),  gospel strutting R&B (\\"Gotta Travel On\\"), and live cuts that aren't \\"lifeless\\" by any means (\\"The Mighty Quinn (Quinn The Eskimo)\\"). In short, it's a musical landscape in the shape of America. This was Dylan just being a musician in the purest sense. But I guess all his so-called fans and the music press didn't really like the SOUND of Dylan or his music. They simply liked the IDEA of his music. When they were left to hear Dylan croon \\"Blue Moon\\" they couldn't process that. It didn't compute. Why would Dylan just sing a nice little song he liked? Because he was a SINGER and he liked the song. And by this point, Dylan was a very expressive vocalist. They didn't call them covers when Sinatra or Elvis did them. Bob Dylan was an entertainer. This was what he was saying with SELF PORTRAIT. He was a song & dance man. A traveling hobo with a guitar and a tall tale. A man that looked up at the big blue sky and took a breath of air. A balladeer, a vanguard, a clown...a brilliant genius child. It's as Dylan as Dylan gets. I'll take \\"Wigwam\\" over any dated protest song any day of the week. Because what you get with \\"Wigwam\\" and  the other songs on SELF PORTRAIT is the pure joy of music.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|WOW!<br /><br />I did NOT see this coming!  Kenny Wayne Shepherd has put together an absolute blues masterpiece!  Track after track sees Shepherd playing with the greats and lesser knowns of the blues, from the backwoods to the blues club, acoustic and electric.<br /><br />But the guest star album has been done to death, so what makes this one different?  Well, it's tough to put your finger on, that's for sure.  It could be that the songs aren't Kenny Wayne Shepherd, featuring another blues artist, but another blues artist, featuring Shepherd.  It allows for each song to have a distinctive flair of its own, for each of these seasoned blues singers and guitarists to really lend their own styles to the music.  This creates an album where the songs are played with a lot of soul, energy, and emotion, and it's truly a pleasure to hear such varied voices in one album.<br /><br />Amazing!
1840233028|5.0|If you've never read anything by Alan Moore, this may just seem like a vulgar comic book to you. However, Alan Moore's goal was simply to retell the stories of classic writer's (with their intrinsic social commentary) in a modern medium.
B000002KMY|4.0|The second Black Sabbath offering of the Ronnie James Dio era, Mob Rules doesn't quite live up to Dio's first effort with the band, but it's still an album worth hearing.<br /><br />A mix of the styles on Heaven and Hell and the more experimental material from the Ozzy era, Mob Rules has a darker feel, in some aspects, than Sabbath had had, at this point, for many years.  And there are some really great tracks to be found on this one.  \\"The Sign of the Southern Cross\\" is an album highlight which, when combined with the title track, \\"The Mob Rules,\\" makes for a killer first half of the album.  The guitar work on the title track is, in itself, worth owning the album for, and is representative of a generally high level of performance throughout.<br /><br />A great opening riff in \\"Country Girl,\\" the same melody repeated throughout in the vocal lines, marks a strong beginning to the album's second half, and the track is utterly addictive in its simplicity.  The remainder of the second half is also quite strong.  It's not the best material Sabbath has put together, but it's a considerable improvement over the end of the Ozzy era, and is generally enjoyable material.<br /><br />All in all, it adds up to a strong album.  Dio continues to shine, on this one, as Sabbath's vocalist, and to carve a space for himself atop Mt. Sabbath, proving that the band is no one-album-wonder with him at the helm.
1932100660|3.0|The book does a good job of delivering the message that consumption of animal protein leads to various illnesses such as cancers of the breast, prostate and large bowel, diabetes, coronary heart disease, obesity, autoimmune disease, osteoporosis, degenerative brain disease and macular degeneration. I agree with the conlusion that a plant based whole foods diet is in general better than the typical animal protein diet. However, for the case of cow milk protein casein, Dr.Campbell applies the same scientific reductionism that he warns us about related to isolated vitamin and antioxidant supplements.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|What can I say except WOW.  I haven't been that much of a follower of The Beatles or their movies, however there were a few songs I liked and I liked what The Beatles represented.  I bought Across the Universe expecting nothing and am pleased that I made this purchase.  The covers of the songs are spectacular, especially when Woods sings Blackbird, and the gospel chior sing Let It Be.  The acting is supurb, the singing wonderful, and plot line filled with history of earlier decade, emotion, and humor.  Must buy for anyone who is a music lover.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I started watching Dexter because I was a huge fan of Michael C. Hall from Six Feet Under.  The first few episodes I thought...hmmmm, not so sure about this.  It was good, but I wasn't hooked.  But the more episodes I watched, the more I just *had* to keep watching. I was addicted in no time! Now my husband and I are about half way through season 2 (On  Demand) and we watch at least 1-2 episodes a night.  It is enthralling-- like a drawn out movie with twists and turns you would never expect.  A+ from me.
1593082800|4.0|Don't let the length of this Victorian novel put you off... it's actually quite exciting to read at some parts and is a page-turner.  The only complaint I have is the fact that the last 80 or so pages are all \\"wrap up\\" and it dragged for a bit.  However, the rest of the book was very exciting and kept me interested.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book!      The Barnes & Noble edition has quite a few typos (in one instance, a \\"1\\" was used instead of \\"I\\"!) but it's still a great value.
B000002UAX|5.0|One of the reviewers said it best with this line...<br /><br /> \\"It is, simply, a series of highly personal statements from three songwriters, coalescing around no particular theme other than the right to personal expression.\\"<br /><br /> I couldn't agree more.
0553381687|5.0|I loved this book.  It was very realistic for a fantasy war novel.  Great things don't always happen to the heroes of the book.  War is not fun and games, and Martin showed that very well in his novel.  I very highly recommend this and his next two books in the series.
0765357151|5.0|Whether you've seen the latest movie or one of the others made over the years,or just looking for a really good read you enjoy this book.<br />Well written,very deep yet easy to follow.
0812550706|5.0|I highly recommend Ender's Game.  The book really showed us some increadible war and fighting strategy by using Ender and his team.  There was a lot of action throughout the first 3/4 of the book, but the ending was a bit slow. The entire book was well written though.  I look forward to continuing the series.
158270208X|5.0|LOVE THE WORKBOOK AND THE BOOK FOR WHICH IT ACCOMPANYS HOPE MORE PEOPLE EXPIERENCE AND LIVE MORE BY THE INTENT OF THE SECRET
B000TLMWMY|5.0|This set is a must have, not for Cash fans alone.  The variety and performances on the DVD are second to none.  I was shocked to see some of the live performances that I had missed or forgotten.  Absolutely 5 Stars!!!
B0000028VT|5.0|Before the drama of \\"Glitter\\", during the height of her popularity, Mariah released this short and sweet album, \\"Music Box\\".  A sparkler and extremely memorable, this album holds strong even by today's standards, and continues to sell well.  Once upon a time, Mariah really could belt out a tune, and \\"Music Box\\" proves it.  A far cry from the more hip hop oriented work of her later years, Mariah worked with a combination of writers and producers that equaled success.  Maybe it wasn't exactly what she wanted to do artistically, but it was one of the biggest musical phenomena of the decade.    One of Mariah's most well known songs emerged from the track listing: \\"Dreamlover\\" would go on to become one of the biggest hits of the year and at the time was Mariah's highest charting song ever.  The flawless recipe of bouncy beats, charming bells and lighthearted lyrics made a completely unique concoction that hadn't been heard before.  The other tracks on the album easily fall into the adult contemporary genre, with the gorgeous ballads \\"Never Forget You\\", \\"Just To Hold You Once Again\\" and Mariah's other huge hit, \\"Hero\\".  The lyrics are typical mid-90's sap, but coming from Mariah they sound stunning.  She had the huge voice to carry such sensitive and otherwise lifeless material.  Mariah presents these songs better than almost anyone else could.  The actual song \\"Music Box\\" is entirely charming and beautiful and it's a wonder it was never released as a single.    The fiery dance tracks, \\"Now That I Know\\" and \\"I've Been Thinking about You\\", are extremely catchy numbers, the former being an exhausting and addictive declaration.  \\"Without You\\", which may be Mariah's best selling single internationally, sounds fabulous with her vocals laid over the simple melodic arrangement.  Though I'm not a fan of covers, Mariah did a great job with it and made it her own: More complex than the original, it nearly outshines all other versions.    \\"Music Box\\" may not be Mariah's best album,but it's certainly one of the more cohesive ones she's done.  Nearly fifteen years after its release, several of these songs still appear on the radio.  That certainly suggests staying power.
B000002UQJ|2.0|Poor follow up to \\"Flowers In the Dirt\\", some of which borders on mediocre at best.
B000P12LWY|2.0|What show are the rest of these reviewers watching? I was excited to see this after reading the reviews, but barely made it through the first two hours. Incredibly boring, like a lavish network soap with all that implies. The history is sketchy; if you're going to twist history, at least make it fun and appealing in some way that the truth does not.<br /><br />This is one of the slowest and most unpleasant tv shows I have seen in some time. Then again, I don't watch tv, only tv shows on dvd that reviewers I usually trust found to be good. Guess that's not the best way either! Oh well, I found The Office (the funny version) and Arrested Development that way, so it can't be all bad. Didn't work this time, though.<br /><br />Pass.
B000UCEJEQ|3.0|I have loved Annie from the early days.  Her voice and keyboards are great as always, but this lacks the catchy hits that were mixed with the tender ballads and dance tracks on the earlier solo releases.  I will have to listen to this a few more times.
B000244FDW|3.0|I believe I may have watched this in English class in high school, and yet it isn't quite the way I remembered it.  I'm wondering if there was another version (PBS, maybe?) prior to 1990. Overall, this is a good telling of Pride and Prejudice, if you can get past the fact that it IS a bit dated.  It is difficult to write a review of this version without comparing it to the 1995 version, because they are both good, and come closer to representing the book than the alternatives, including the horrible 2005 version.      Casting and character development - What is good about this version:  Jane was prettier than in the 1995 version.  (Susannah York in the 1995 version was pretty, but the way they styled her hair did not really suit the shape of her face.)  Lydia seems a little sweeter than in the '95 version - silly, capable of being led astray, boy-crazy, but not as trampy.  I think this is more accurate.  Mrs. Bennet, too, seems more harmless in this version.  She is silly, she lacks a sense of propriety, but she is more likeable. The overall casting of the Bennet girls is better - their facial features bear enough similarities that they look like they could be siblings. What is not as good:  Lizzy doesn't have quite enough spark to her.  Jennifer Ehle may have been a bit over-the-top in 1995, but she seemed more the lively Eliza Bennet I pictured when reading the book.  Kitty seems a little too old.  Also, I missed Maria Lucas.  Sure, she was a background character, but she provided a contrast with Elizabeth in her behavior toward Lady Catherine.  Without her, Charlotte had to become more obsequious.  In a five hour series, they could have left her in, maybe even had her become the person who got in the way in the scene after Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy come to dinner at the Bennet's, instead of some strange woman suddenly appearing in the end of the movie. (The woman who prevents, at first, Elizabeth from being able to speak with Mr. Darcy.)  Georgiana seemed a bit underdeveloped, too. I don't remember her actually playing or singing, despite the fact that her musical ability is much touted. The Pemberley scenes feel rushed.  Also, Anne de Bourgh seems a little too likeable.  She doesn't look as sickly, and gives the impression that maybe she really is nice when she seems to want to embrace Elizabeth when they take leave of each other.    The music/costuming/cinematography - this was the reason I only gave the movie three stars, rather than four.  The background music was just GOOFY through most of the movie.  The cinematography was poor quality.  I felt like I was watching reruns of episodes of All My Children from the early 1980s - which was kind of amusing, but distracted from the story.  The costumes were tolerable, but both costumes and hair were somehow reminiscent of the late 1970s early 1980s.  While it did not totally ruin the production, it was a distraction.      Overall, this was a fun rendition to watch.  I can understand why some people prefer this to the 1995 A&E version, but I have to say I prefer the 1995.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|Boy, these two make a lot of noise for a duet.  But seriously, there are catchy singles, blues based homages, and plenty of slide for fans of Jack White.  I like this!
B00005JPTI|3.0|Ok, so 'A Boy and His Dog' is probably not an apt comparison - except for the fact that they are both 'Post Apocalyptic' films about a guy and a dog.  'I Am Legend' definitely had its good points - Will Smith was excellent, as always, and the overall production design was incredible.  The whole 'look and feel' of NYC three years after a virus wiped out the entire human population was quite well done. However, the overall story line and relatively thin plot left me wanting something more, and the abrupt ending was unfulfilling. 3.5 stars.
078322804X|5.0|As a musician, the band is second to none.  Where else can you see Matt Murphy and Bones Malone play with Duck Dunn and Steve Cropper other than some of the old SNL shows.  You better THINK about owning this one ASAP
B000UBMSB8|5.0|This is a great collection for any sci-fi fan.  Has 4 versions of the movie so you can make up your own mind on which one you prefer.  Has great extras on the movie and the background of making the movie.  All of which is very interesting.  It's amazing how there is a story behind every detail of the movie.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|Play this loud.  Lots of vintage clips, and stuff from the vault.  The boys rock with endless energy.<br /><br />Enjoy
B000OY8NII|5.0|Eureka is a delightful change of pace from the run of the mill SciFi channel offerings. Not too serious, but with the scifi in place, it's always interesting to see what exotic and unusual experiments have gone awry, and what the consequences are for the town. What's not to like, a town where Science is king, and the sceintists get to play with as many of their toys as they want, government funded to boot! The cast have grown into their respective characters very well, and each brings something to the show, and the personal interactons between characters is becoming well developed as well.<br /><br />Along with Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis, the show is well written, the science makes sense, even if it's out there sometimes, you never know what's going to happen. I like this show and plan on buying season 2, 3,4,5 or how ever many seasons it lasts. It's a joy to watch and intriguing as well.
B000OQF6N6|3.0|Better than the last Pumpkins release, before the break up.  Still lacking the fire of \\"Melloncollie\\" or \\"Siamese Dream\\", but interesting none the less.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|I recieved my Grand Diver about 3-4 days ago and I could not be happier w/ it.  I currently own a Breitling Chronomat Evolution, which is a great watch, but I was wearing it everyday and needed a second watch to mix up the wearing time with.  I found the Grand Diver, read the reviews on it, then bought it.  The 47mm case is large and bold, (it looks similiar to the Omega Seamaster).  The weight of the watch is heavy, just like my Evolution.  For the money you just can't beat the looks and the quality of this.[[ASIN:B000FVE3AC Invicta Men's Pro Diver Collection Grand Diver Automatic Watch #3045]] I am very pleased thus far, and if all goes well, I will be searching for other Invicta products very soon.
B000I9WW4U|5.0|Without giving away the plot line. If you're a Pacino fan. This film is a must see. His character & story line are so strong. He doesn't need a leading lady to bounce off of. He carries it all on his own. It's not over-the-top Pacino grandstanding. It's a touching portrayal. It made me cry. Thanks Colonel.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|Thinking about purchasing? Don't. Save your money for a Blu-Ray player and for CBS to release the inevitable Blu-Ray version. The format war is over. Toshiba has officially announced they are stopping development and production of HD-DVD players. Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Netflix have all hopped on the Blu-Ray bandwagon effectively killing HD-DVD. No announcement has been made regarding CBS's plans for the series, but no doubt they're working on switching to Blu-Ray as you read this. [...]

0060254920|5.0|So, let's get this straight: I'm 39, I'm an author, I have read Shakespeare, I have a blisteringly high IQ, and yet this book has consistently remained one of the three books I would take in regards to the silly question \\"If you were stranded on a desert island and were only allowed to bring three books, which three would they be?\\" Why?    Because, as Jareth, from another great tale, once said \\"if you turn it this way and that..\\"  Do you understand yet?     It's a children's book because someone claimed it is and children do so love it. It is a very adult book, full of wise counsel, full of lurking madness and mayhem, showing off, in simple wording, the dangers of the world outside our windows. It is endearing and enrapturing.     People will tell you that it's good for building character and it's probably true. They will tell you that there are lessons to be learned inside and of this I am certain.    Don't buy it for those reasons, dear ladies and gentlemen, because those reasons are the by-product of the truth. The truth is that this book is cunningly crafted, absolute, genius in form and function, in line and in text. Buy it, because you'll want to read it so many times that, if you should opt to check it out from the library instead, you are bound to make the librarian cross.
0060558121|5.0|This book contains some of Gaiman's very best writing, and also encompasses an amazing number and variety of themes -- the place of the gods in humanity's scheme of things (and vice versa), the nature of belief and unbelief (and why they matter, or don't), and of life and death (which are not mutually exclusive categories), why America is fundamentally different from the Old World (and why it's the same, too), and what the point of it all is. Or perhaps there's no point at all -- and that's the point. From the beginning, when Shadow leaves prison to attend the funeral of his unfaithful wife and is recruited on the way by Mr. Wednesday (who is really Wodan, the All-Father), the reader slides into a world in which the old deities and supernatural beings of Egypt and Scandinavia and the Balkans and Africa and the Caribbean are caught in a struggle with the new gods of technology and television and drugs and the Interstate and the media. Which side will win? Which side deserves to? Shadow starts out as a driver/errand boy, merely an observer, but he ends as an important participant in the would-be war. But the war turns out to be something else, too. Part of the book is an extended road trip, a tour of America's true holy places -- most of them roadside attractions -- and convoluted, gray cities and perfect small towns. Along the way, Gaiman pauses to recount short fictions about the past and the gods' place in the world. Throughout, his style and use of the language are hypnotic, and his characters -- even the spear-carriers -- are multidimensional. This is especially true of old Hinzelmann, and Low Key Lyesmith, and Mssrs. Ibis & Jaquel, and Czernobog with his hammer, and young Samantha Black crow, and the technical boy, and most esecially of Laura, who loves Shadow beyond death. A gorgeous book.
B000YXMMAE|3.0|Frankly,I was disappointed by this release.Perhaps there is something I am not getting;but I believe that \\"in Rainbows\\" is a minor-league CD alongside Radiohead's \\"The Bends\\",\\"OK Computer\\",\\"Pablo Honey\\" and \\"Hail to the Thief\\". I gave it three stars because in a way,I can see that it is good,well-executed and well-produced.It's just really boring for me to listen too. Three stars only because I have a lot of respect for Radiohead.If any other band put something like this out,I would've given it two stars.I have listened to it several times before I wrote this and it gives me nothing to hold onto.  I just think that it is sort of a retread.Nothing new here.  I hope the band get it going in a more creative direction the next time around.
0790729989|4.0|As a rule, I have a high tolerance for violence and gore in movies, but this one squicked even me. It's certainly the most nightmare-inducing film I've seen recently. The setting is very noir, a dark and rainy unnamed city, in which the youngish Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is replacing Det. Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who is about to retire. Then a series of horrific murders begins -- from which the camera never pans away -- themed on the Seven Deadly sins, and there's a lot of chasing about in alleys and tenements. The serial killer, John Doe, is played by Kevin Spacey, who can be a little creepy even when he's not playing a role. It's all madness and mayhem delivered up in a tight, non-predictable script, largely as seen through Somerset's dour, pessimistic view of the world. It's the sort of film you can admire without actually liking it much. Especially the ending.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I really enjoy this show. The second season is better than the first one. See this show and you will be fan like me!! It's sure I tell you!!
B000050GBF|2.0|Even for a movie based on a comic book, this one is pretty unwatchable, partly because it tries to take itself way too seriously. I saw \\"X-Men\\" shortly after seeing \\"Fantastic Four,\\" and it suffers greatly by comparison. The only non-cardboard characters are Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin), and even then Wolverine was too much the nice guy instead of an antihero. This also may be Patrick Stewart's worst movie yet, and Ian McKellen doesn't come out much better. The other actors simply chew the scenery. And -- again, even for a comic book -- the plot holes are enormous. E.g., where did the billions of dollars come from to construct the underground complex at Xavier's private school? (I hate to think what the tuition bills are like. . . .) The original Superman and Batman flicks are proof that a good film of this type is possible.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought the CD before going to the show.  I listened to it a few times before seeing the broadway and now that I saw it in person I can't get enough of the CD.  Amazing music!
B000001FMC|5.0|This is one my choices for 'Desert Island' Cd collection.  You need this one in your collection of '80's greats.  It has it all, great vocals, lyrics, and the best music.
B0004Z33EG|4.0|This is by far and away the best of the Rambo films, but funnily enough frequently forgotten, because the second movie was so much more successful. With elements of 'Deliverance' and 'Southern Comfort' this creates an atmospheric movie which is thrilling, entertaining and pretty violent as well.<br /><br />Stallone doesn't have to do much acting wise, but his action stuff is well done and generally he looks the part and is very believeable as a disgruntled Vietnam Vet. However its the always excellent Brian Dennehy as the local Town Sheriff, who has bitten off more than he can chew, that holds the film together, with another classy performance.<br /><br />IMO this is the only one of the first three Rambo films worth owning (I haven't seen the latest yet) and it should be in your collection.
0525950079|4.0|First of all I will preface this as everyone else did....Pillars was brilliant.  I read it twice and it is still my favorite book.  That being said....World is magnificent...but not pillars.  I would rate this a 4.5.  It kept me enthralled through 1000+ pages and I am sorry to put it down.  I do share some disappointment with this book, but only by comparasion.  Pillars was an epic book which spanned decades.  If it was to be summed up in one sentance, \\"The tale of the building of a cathedral and the lives of the people affected\\".  World spans decades and tells of the lives of four characters...but there is no core to this book.  In Pillars everything revolved around the cathedral and it provided the reader with a degree of stability and a central theme.  World possess many different subplots ranging from politics, the plague, medicine, and some building.  Facinating stuff, but without a central core.  Instead a a cathedral, we get bridges, spires, homes, and palaces.  Great, but not quite 5 star material.  Never read Pillars....Read it now!  Read Pillars and loved it?  Buy this book, but take your time and savor every morsel because this book took decades to write and you won't see another for a long time (or ever)!
B000UGG39Q|3.0|I just saw down live Saturday and they were awesome as expected so I figured I would give this cd another chance.  Let me preface this with the fact that Down-NOLA is my favorite metal record of all time and one of my top 10 records PERIOD and Down II- A bustle in your hedgerow is an excellent record as well.  However, this record sounds like a band that is trying to hard to sound like Down.  Phil's voice sounds weak, the guitar riffs are not even in the same zip code as they were in the other albums, and to compound this, #8 \\"Beneath the Tides\\" sounds exactly like \\"13 Angels\\" by Corrosion of Conformity.  When I heard the opening riff to this song in concert, I actually thought they were going to cover the Corrosion of Conformity song since 2 of their members are from C.O.C.  Too bad.  There are only 3 songs that I actually like.  \\"3 Suns and 1 Star\\", \\"Onward March the Saints\\", and \\"Beneath the Tides\\" (the Corrosion of Conformity ripoff).  I say buy Down I and II and if you already have those, just download those 3 songs off this album and you will be set as far as Down goes.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|I got both of them. If you want the true \\"Star Trek\\", get the yel/blue/red sets - that is as close to a definitive version as we have.  If you also want a beautifully colored version (I'm assuming the colors were enhanced rather than restored because they are so bright) with great clarity it is worth it to get the new set. All the exterior space shots and shots of the ships and planets are completely digitized (?!?!) and have been redone digitally so they look like they're from 90's .It would have been perfect if they had just left the new digital stuff out and just did the color/clarity.    The new hd-dvd version is for fun extra-entertainment and does breathe new life into the show and I luv watching the interior shots but the digital replacements are just silly compared to the caretakingly created, beautifully crafted shots of the original and are often glaringly annoying (aka the pastel swirlys!). The new set though brightly lit and clear is also missing the depth, subtlety, and endearingly flawed graininess (which I love) of the cinematography which made ST so real . The set that is the true Star Trek which has the original, truly beautiful and visionarily filmed space-sequences is the blue/yellow/red dvd sets.    In other words, whether you buy this hd-set or not - do NOT miss getting the blue/yel/red sets, if u want ST!!!
B000000I3O|5.0|Though very often heralded as punk, or goth punk, or even metal, the Misfits are none-of-the-above.  In-fact, the Misfits, not easily pigeonholed, have all the very early makings of what has now become Psychobilly: classic 50's rock-a-billy era tunes infused with heavy punk and some heavy metal elements.  Their influence can easily be heard in the result of many modern bands, i.e. Tiger Army, Necromantiks, The Quakes and etc.  A definite tight album with great hits form their early years, that showcases Danzig's songwriting ability.
B000RJO578|5.0|This movie is hilarious in a way that most of the crap that comes out of Hollow wood no longer is. It has a lot to do with the acting. I never saw Shaun of the Dead, but I intend to. If it's half as funny as this was, I'm sure it'll be worth it.   The only really disturbing part was the murder in the churchyard. I saw it coming, obviously, but it was shocking how graphic it was.
B000002GYR|5.0|Every time I hear 'Closing Time', time comes to a stop and everything which was important dwindles away to nothingness. Every girl I have loved, every regret I have ever had, every hope that life holds comes together in one overwhelming emotion. I do not mean it is sad, it is the kind of emotion which is healthy to have, it is the musical equivalent of sitting in a dark bar all evening drinking and thinking.    The whole album is excellent, although I am partial to 'Martha','I hope I don't fall in love with you','Ol'55', 'Grapefruit Moon' and 'Closing Time'.     This is a perfect album when it is really late at night, the city is asleep and all you hear are Tom Waits and raindrops against the windowpane. The world is perfect all over again by being insignificant.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Maybe their best album since the classic \\"O.K. Computer,\\" Radiohead's \\"In Rainbows\\" contains one gem after another.  Can anyone doubt any longer that Radiohead is one of the greatest rock bands of all time?  While I was initially skeptical given the unique circumstances of its release (pay what you want to download the album), I couldn't believe how great it was when I finally purchased it.  Whether rocking with electric guitars (\\"Body Snatchers\\") or with acoustic ones (\\"Jigsaw Falling into Place\\"); whether giving us spine chilling beauty (the soulful \\"Reckoner,\\" \\"House of Cards\\" and \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\" -- the latter of which reminds me very much of the wonderful Fleetwood Mac song \\"Sara\\"); or whether just giving us that distinct Radiohead sound (all of the rest), \\"In Rainbows\\" is as close to a flawless album that I've heard in quite some time.  This is that unique album that wraps around itself -- once it concludes (with the eerie \\"videotape\\"), you feel compelled to listen again.    What a wonderful album!  Look at all those 5 star ratings -- they're well deserved.
1579125549|4.0|This is not my favorite chess encyclopedia, but it contains lots of good material and, especially considering its price, is worth having.    I think the most useful part of this book is \\"600 Miniature Games.\\" After having seen this book for years, I finally bought it for this section alone. Each of the games contains miniatures decided by decisive attacks on the King's Field (f7/f2, g7/g2, h7/h2, f6/f3, g6/g3, h6/h3), whether the king is castled or not. You can basically follow these without a chess set and sometimes I like to open this book and \\"do\\" some of these in my head as an attacking refresher. I have some of Convekta's software (CT Art, etc) but those compendia have more varied problems and with this section of L. Polgar's book, I can focus in on kingside attacking practice.    Recommended.
1594489505|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  As a western woman I sometimes forget that the rest of the world does not respect women.  We have enjoyed fantastic progress in the western world when compared to the tragic lives that women in Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and other Islamic countries.  We are fortunate enough not to be treated as property, something that is used for personal pleasure and child rearing.  Hearing the story of Maryam and Laila just makes me want to cry at times, and jump for joy in others.    I love hearing how Afghanistan is progressing after the Taliban were removed - this seems so positive for the Afghan women.  This is a fanstastic book, it will tear at your heart, especially if you are a women fortuniate enough to live in the western world.  It makes living here seen even more special.
B000N0WCLC|5.0|I have to admit - I am not a great Leonard DiCaprio fan - however I was tremendously impressed with not only the Blu-Ray rendering of this movie, but also if there is a defining role for DiCaprio so far, this movie in my opinion is it.    The cinematography and directing is outstanding and the BD rendering is wonderful.  Scenes and sound were excellent and rich with dead on color balancing and sound that was not over powering but very powerful.  I found myself completely drawn into the action and story (even though the ending was predictable).    Great rendering on Blu-Ray, great directing, great acting and story.
B000VDDWE2|4.0|This is an ok movie with a somewhat redundent plot, but that is not what makes this a great Blu-Ray in the first place.  It is the special effects.  In the L.A. tornado scene, you can feel the twisters swirling around you.  I noticed tons of debree that i did not notice in the regular dvd. Video is a 5+.
0380715430|5.0|This book brings to the forefront the richness of the English language.  English is my cherished second language and I feel heavily indebted to it.  English has allowed me to travel to some countries where I would have remained almost incommunicado with my native Spanish.  Also, English has allowed me access to certain books that deal with topics that are not available in Spanish written books (to my knowledge).      To read this book was a pleasurable experience to me.  The book is entertaining, instructive, full of useful information, and, inspiring.  This book is a must reading for anybody that loves the English language.  Five shining stars for it.
B000ZM1MG4|3.0|I am hoping that it is not just myself that feel sthe two biggest grossing movies with male/female switching roles are played by in this case Dustin Hoffman and in the case of Mrs Doubtfire by Robin Williams.  This may seem a case of what i syour point,and i will tell you both of these Actors Hoffman especially is fantastic as the male he plays in so many movies,as is Williams in the right movie not some of the drivel that he has unfortunately taken on at times.  Anyway that i sthe case here,i cannot get past the fact that that is Dustin Hoffman as a woman,and my goodness he makes an ugly lady.  Having taken that into account the movie is alright,nothing special but a bit of light entertainment.  I am definitely a fan of Hoffman's and this movie did very well for all concerned,i am forever grateful that he put away that dress and hairstyle having said that.  Ian.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|Let's see - I sat through Grease in the theater 5 times with my daughter and I guess Zac Efron has eyes to match John Travolta. All of my grandchildren love this video, not just the oldest granddaughter - the songs are sweet and it's so great to see a musical that kids love. So glad to know schools are performing these. And keep them G-rated please Disney. These are watched by 2 year olds on up in my family.
B000XPU5NY|1.0|Looking at the other reviews here, it seems I'm in the minority, but I found this album to be absolutely dreadful. It fails both artistically and technically.    Aside from the new drum duet, every song on the album has been released on previous live albums. That's not really unexpected since Genesis have always released live albums on a regular basis. What is unexpected is that they didn't even bother to mix the songs up a bit. The arrangements are practically identical to those on earlier releases. Even the medleys (something they've always been good with) are the same. Not a single new one in the bunch.    Technically, this is the worst sounding album they've ever produced. I first listened to the cd in my car and thought I must have blown a speaker. But when I listened to it at home I realized that it really does just sound bad. The drums are muddy and indistinct. The guitars are completely buried in the mix. And the keyboards sound like a Casio demo. The whole thing sounds as though it was recorded in a cardboard box.    If you already have their other live albums, stick with them. As someone who owns practically everything the band has ever released, I can honestly say that I will probably never listen to this cd again.    TA
B000YABYLA|1.0|*Spoiler alert* Where to begin? The annoying soundtrack? The fact that this teenage girl would not know '70's punk rock while being born in the 90's and having a dumb blonde for a friend who wouldn't know Richard Hell from the Germs? The dialogue is SO over the top and unbelievable that a loner indie kid would actually talk that way. oh I forgot - the old soul vibe which is supposed to make her \\"cool\\". Her only options seems to be abortion or giving the kid to snotty yuppies. Wow, what fantastic choices. Way to have any kind of morals about the living thing inside you.  Her comments about the unborn child \\"it\\" as she refers to it are borderline offensive yet for no reason her step-mom encourages this type of mentality. And OF COURSE your parents are not only supportive of your teenage pregnancy but have witty one-liners to spout about it as well. And poor Michael cera - treated as a sperm-producing punching bag. He has no say in what is going on and only after the abortion and the yuppies fall through that Juno \\"realizes\\" they must have been in love all along and knocks on his door saying \\"surprise! since I have nowhere better to go you are the father so be happy\\" and Michael Cera has no option but to deal with it. Horrible dialogue which mo one should have to endure, unbelievable and rude storyline. Maybe this was made for people who watch things like Delta Farce and American Pie type of mentality. This movie is just a slap in the face to anyone who has a brain and some decent morals. There is a reason it was denied any awards. PS - why do people use the word \\"indie\\" for this movie? It has major stars and a big budget. I would just use the word \\"boring\\". A horrible snapshot of ignorant youth more concerned about being obssessed with nostalgic music and horror flicks rather than dealing with the living mistake now inside her. The \\"witty banter\\" is just an aural illussion to make you forget that she is in complete denial about what is actually happening to her.
0751532711|1.0|This book is every \\"get rich quick flipping properties\\" late night infomercial cliche boiled down and committed to paper.     I literally burst out laughing in chapter six when he says he and his wife had \\"more than one million dollars in cash\\" and just one paragraph later says that he had to borrow $2,000 from \\"a friend for 90 days for $200\\" in order to make a down payment.    A \\"millionaire\\" has to borrow $2,000 from a FRIEND at 10% for 3 months??????  Right...
037571457X|5.0|Persepolis truly humanized what has happened in Iran in the last few years for me.  The young girl's tale is precocious and beautifully told by Satrapi.  I have not seen the movie but look forward to it.

032147404X|4.0|Scott Kelby really let's you know how to take better photographs.  While this shouldn't be the first book you read about photography, it is still a must have in your library.  You must know some basics about photography to really apply his advice but his recommendations are the same ones he shares with the pros.  I learned a lot from this book and highly recommend this purchase.<br /><br />April 2008 update:<br />Pick up Volume 2 as well. A great read.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|For the record, I am a collector of good movies and I own over 2200 movies at this time (all store bought). Hollywood has been putting out a great deal of trashy movies of late, however... The Covenant is spectacular.  I first saw it on Starz, I watched it four times before purchasing the movie.  Since then, I have watched it eight times.  I can't get enough of this movie.  I am 51 years old and I recommend this movie for all ages.  It was nice to sit down and watch a movie with all new faces.  Hollywood needs to look for more scripts like the Covenant.  I'm a little tired of the remakes they're putting out.  Trust me folks, this movie may not be considered an \\"A-Lister\\" movie to Hollywood, but I say it's the best I've seen in a long time and I'd like to see them do a sequel to this one.  It's a must see for sure...
B000TGJ7ZY|4.0|For those looking to buy this movie for Blu-Ray... The quality is barely above DVD level. I was disappointed with how grainy and blurry the shots were compared to other Blu-Ray titles available.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it is a classic, and if you have not seen it, you should. It goes over all Dracula lore, from Renfeld to Van Helsing, to Dracula's 3 sisters. And unlike the newer movie Van Helsing, this movie is very good, and oddly focuses on the character and romance, as opposed to relying on special effects.
B000VOOLX2|4.0|This is the version of RCM I bought. Allow me to give you my original review of this album with the addition of \\"Cry Baby Cry\\":  1. The Valley- Reminds me of a Depeche Mode song. Ok track.(3)  2. Red Carpet Massacre- A rocker-like song with a \\"circus\\" beat popping up in between(??). Lyrics about the paparazzi. I wish this song could've been longer..(2)  3. Nite Runner- Funky, upbeat dance song. Justin and Simon's voice blend beautifully together. Definitely worthy of a single, I'd give it a 5 if it didn't have the rapping on it.(4)  4. Faling Down- Best song on the album. Reminds me of \\"Ordinary World.\\" Well done!(5)  5.Box Full of Honey- Ok track.(3)  6. Skin Divers- WORST SONG EVER. It had nothing to do with the music or the words. It was Timba-man's little \\"whicky,whicky,whicky\\" in the chorus that got on my nerves. Man, totally not gangsta.(0)  7. Tempted- Sounds like \\"Sexy Back..\\" (1)  8. Tricked out- An instrumental piece. To me,it sounded like something pulled off a Tim Burton movie. Waste of 2 minutes!(1)  9. Zoom in- Forgetable. It's 3 minutes of listening to \\"noise.\\"(1)  10. She's too much- Slow rock song. Not a favorite, though. Can't we use real drums?(2)  11. Dirty Great Monster- Spooky, dark song. Disappointing end.(2)  12. Last Man Standing- Boring, the hip-hop beats sound like that One Republic song that Timba-man produced. What happened to Roger???(1)  13. Cry Baby Cry (Bonus Track)- Another good one, wish this had been on the orginal album. Funky dance track about young hollywood. Like it better than the last seven tracks. Not to disappoint!(4)    (Original) Overall- O.K,4 stars,why? (1)It's Duran Duran, (2)Give them credit for trying, (3)\\"Falling Down\\", (4)in hopes that I'll get my hands on that \\"Reportage\\" album. Who wants to hear, \\"Criminals in the Capitals\\"?     (New!)  Minus one for the overproduction. Timba-man and Danja could've taken it to the next level, but it seems they fell flat. It's not the same Duran Duran sound. To me, it's all of Timba's work thrown into a blender with a dash of Simon LeBon and that's RCM. If it wasn't for the rap and had some more live playing (especailly drums! Where's Roger on this CD??) I would've given this 5 stars. On the other hand, Justin did a fantastic job with \\"Falling Down,\\" why couldn't he produce the whole album?    I hope \\"Reportage\\" is released in the near future. It's already DONE. Written, recorded, produced, and all it needed was the green light and we would've all had this album, back in EARLY 2007 that is. \\"Too political\\" and no starting single stopped this album and you got RCM instead. \\"Reportage\\" was a harder rock-controversial album taking a shot at the world. Who doesn't like controversy? Thanks record executives, for having no balls!!!!! I hope you Duranies want to hear this album, too.     Other than that, if you haven't gotten RCM I recommend you get this version with the bonus track. But if you want my honest opinion, buy the single for \\"Falling Down,\\" All previous albums are recommended, especially of you're new to the band.      RCM is a hit or miss. You either like it or you don't. For me, it was 50/50. It doesn't stand out as much as \\"Astronaut\\" and the sound is like everybody else's music. Too much \\"Futuresex/Lovesounds\\" and not enough Duran Duran. I'm hoping we can get out of 21st century disco and bring back some rock! I miss Duran Duran's old-school rock!    Do whatever you have to get \\"Reportage\\" released! There's a lot of fans who want to hear it! I won't be disappointed! But ditch your current label (Epic), they suck.    The \\"Mad Mind\\" has spoken.

B000R7PYU2|4.0|A book that uses the present panoply of fears to evoke the best in Rumpole and the author.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|The first hours of ETGA was thrilling. Elizabeth (the ever-awesome Cate Blanchett) reigns with confidence and charm. She is held in fearful esteem by her people, whom she swears to protect. But treachery is afoot, in the lingering presence of Catholics in England after the Reformation, and Elizabeth worries about the intentions of her captive cousin, the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots. Meanwhile, Elizabeth plays a teasing game with suitors from around Europe, each hoping to make her his queen. Enter the dashing and roguish Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) fresh from his discovery of Virginia, named for his beloved virgin queen. Raleigh charms his way into Elizabeth's court, and encounters a monarch who is vulnerable in spite of her adamantine exterior. All of this plays out against the threat from Spanish King Philip, busy building a fleet of ships to recapture England for the Church and to depose the \\"illegitimate\\" Elizabeth.<br /><br />As I said, the first half of the film was wonderful -- well-written, clever, visually stunning. The costumes were gorgeous, intricate and convincing. The acting was subtle and believable. It was touching to see Elizabeth grappling with husbandless middle age. But close to the halfway mark, the film founders and never recovers. Inexplicably, Raleigh (who heretofore had the hots for the queen herself) falls for one of her courtesans. This injects a silly \\"forbidden love\\" element into the film. After this, the movie ricochets from one movie clich&eacute; to another. Elizabeth, uncovering a plot by her cousin to take the throne, is disconsolate at the thought of executing a God-appointed queen. This in spite of her father's unstated lack of scruples in beheading E's mother, Anne Boleyn. Philip sets Jesuit plots into spin and launches the Spanish Armada against England. With odds overwhelmingly favoring Spain, will Elizabeth let her darling Raleigh out of prison to take on the Spanish? Will she regain the composure needed to lead her besieged people to victory? Will the manly Raleigh manage to get off his burning ship on time? By the time the movie ended, I really did not care. I no longer believed the character's motivations and lost hope that the movie's loose threads (OK, was E OK with Catholics or bent on hunting them down?) would be tidied up. Having abandoned any hope that the filmmakers would be able to dramatize the panoply of events, the film settles for set pieces. Elizabeth is seen in her flowing nightie, gazing out to sea at the burning enemy ships -- which are clearly visible one moment and enshrouded by fierce storms the next. Symbolic scenes (e.g., the one in which E, perfectly-coiffed and costumed, is circled dizzyingly by the camera) alternate confusingly with literal scenes full of extras. Reconciled with her status as mother of her country, she blesses the child of a couple who should have suffered her regal wrath for having ignored the need for her permission to marry.<br /><br />\\"Elizabeth, The Golden Age\\" had so much going for it. But by trying to tell so many tales at once, it managed to tell none of them well. A disappointment to all but the most ardent Blanchett and Owen fans.ry?

0743496736|3.0|I've been a fan of Picoult's for some time (The Pact remains my favorite book by her), but she missed the mark with this one.  I'm a high school teacher, and I hear teens talk and see them act and interact every single day.  The characters in Nineteen Minutes are simply too contrived; it's as if she took every worst-case scenario that exists in a high school today and turned her characters into caricatures.  Some of the language and the observations made by the students were also simple unbelievable; there is no way a vapid 16 year old boy would make the astute observation \\"If there is no them, then there is no us.\\"  That's a very adult commentary on the situation she's trying to highlight.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though the prose was lovely in places, as always, I couldn't finish this book.  I honestly didn't care how it ended.
B0000029GA|5.0|Now I don't even have to mention how great the lyricism and beats made this album. It's amazing how after reading those 2 star and 1 start reviews, which are mostly comoing from young kids, that they think that these southern rappers are somehow GREAT.  All they rap about is how much they love the dough, cars, b***es, etc.. you get my point. No innovation whatsoever, just the same old things over and over. That stuff gets old REALLY quick. Alright enough of my rants. If you want to check out other classics, Here are just a few I recommend although there are lots and I can spend all day listing them:    Wu-Tang-Enter the Wu-Tang Clan (36 Chambers)  Raekwon-Only Built For Cuban Linx  GZA-Liquid Swords  Kool G Rap-4,5,6  AZ-Do Or Die  Mobb Deep-Infamous  Immortal Technique-Revolutionary Vol.1 and 2    That's just a few but I think you get the idea of what my tastes are. :)
1577314808|5.0|I very much enjoyed Eckhart Tolle's super popular book.  I'd seen  people reading it on the train in NYC and finally my curiosity got  the best of me and I had to check it out for myself.  I've been  interested in self-discovery for some time now and yet there was  still so much to learn and see through Mr Tolle's eyes.  He has a  logical approach that appeals to my scientific side.  He answers that  most fearful of questions about being in the \\"Now\\": what happens if  my \\"now\\" stinks? It's impossible to be present and unhappy.  Lost in  thought is different from actually living in this moment. Your \\"now\\"  and your life situation are not the same, he says, and suddenly I'm  feeling free. In this moment I do have choices and flexibility.  A  very active mind can get in the way of enlightenment (don't  we all have that) but he talks to the mind and opens it to the idea  of present moment living.  I see the reason for the popularity for  this book and I can say oh yes, READ IT.    I feel lucky to also have found Ariel and Shya Kane's book:  [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]]  It's as if Tolle talks to my mind and The Kanes speak to my heart.  The stories in  their book allow one to experience this transforming \\"now\\" even as  the people in the stories experience it.  Reading them both is a true  gift I highly recommend you give to yourself.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|For anyone who likes the genre to anyone who simply likes the actors, this movie is NOT some cheesy witch/wizard flick with a corny drawn out or redone plot. Along with a great storyline, this adventure takes you through a piece of fantasy that hasn't quite been thought of yet.
B000RW3VD4|4.0|Wall Street is interesting as an entertaining and compelling story, that made for a very enjoyable movie experience; but on a deeper level, there is a message about the dangers of unrestrained capitalism--a message that is unfortunately undercut by the dashing and charismatic character of Gordon Gekko, who delivers a speech that is the centerpiece of the film, a speech that really captured the tenor of the times, the Me Generation ethos of the late 80s, the now famous and still remembered and quoted \\"Greed is Good\\" speech:<br /><br />\\"The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed, you mark my words, will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA. Thank you very much.\\"<br /><br />Director Oliver Stone wanted this character to be the villain, giving him the name of a lizard. He was meant to be a cold blooded reptilian character, like a dragon hoarding his treasure in a cave. Some young people take him as a role model. He was clearly not supposed to be, but look at another Oliver Stone film, Natural Born Killers, and the same thing happened there. Oliver Stone takes chances in his films, and though they don't always turn out the way he plans, you have to admire the man. This film in particular really captured an era, and he showed tremendous foresight, in fact it was released in 1987, just before one of the biggest stock market melt-downs in history that happened in October of that year. It also shows the power of information, and even though that information is used to manipulate the market and destroy companies, it truly does foreshadow The Information Age. It is quaint to see the crude graphics on the screens of the computers they used, but what insight it showed into what power would be unleashed by the information displayed there.<br /><br />So, this movie is enjoyable on these two levels, as entertaining drama, and as a serious message about money, capitalism, and the rampant greed of the late 80s, but it is also entertaining just for the behind the scenes drama of the people in it.<br /><br />First, there is a very strong father/son element to Wall Street. Oliver Stone's father, Louis Stone, was a big trader on Wall Street. The film is dedicated to him. And, Oliver Stone's own son, Sean Stone, plays one of Gordon Gekko's children. Oliver Stone was himself a Vietnam veteran, and he had cast Charlie Sheen in Platoon, a big success for them both just the year before. After Wall Street, he would make another Vietnam film, Born on the Fourth of July, but instead of casting Charlie as promised, Tom Cruise would get the role. Stone didn't even bother to tell him, which led to a falling out and they have never worked together since.<br /><br />Charlie Sheen's father, Martin Sheen, played Charlie's character's dad, Carl Fox. Charlie was Bud Fox. Father and son both had big success playing soldiers in Viet Nam, and both would have near-death experiences while making them. While filming Apocalypse Now the elder Sheen suffered a heart attack, and while filming Platoon, the younger Sheen almost fell out of a helicopter. I will revisit the father/son theme later when I discuss Michael Douglas, but back to the Sheen's for now. A lot of the drama of Wall Street revolves around the father/son relationship. Bud Fox's dad works for an airline, and he is hard working and honest. Bud uses inside information gleaned from his father to win favor with Gordon Gekko, who uses that information to gain control of the airline, and then try to wreck it and sell off the pieces. This betrayal is the pivotal point of the whole movie.<br /><br />Martin Sheen's real name is Ramon Antonio Gerard Est&eacute;vez. He is part Irish, and part Spanish, and enjoys being Spanish almost as much as he does being Irish, and he really enjoys being Irish. Though he has played President of the United States at least 4 times, perhaps most memorably as President Jed Bartlett on the long running TV series The West Wing, in real life he is a life long political activist who has been arrested at protests over 70 times. He also knows all the lyrics and can sing every song that was ever sung by Frank Sinatra. In addition to Charlie, 3 of his other children are also actors. Emilio Est&eacute;vez is Charlie's older brother, and 2 others go by the Est&eacute;vez name. But those who know him say that he is closest to his son, Charlie. \\"No father could ever be prouder of his son,\\" said, Sheen, the Elder.  \\"I hold Charlie's accomplishments dearer than my own. He has been through so much and overcome so much more. Even if he weren't my son he'd still be my best friend.\\"<br /><br />Charlie Sheen's real name was Carlos Irwin Est&eacute;vez. He was born on September 3, 1965, in New York City. He was born a \\"blue baby,\\" and the doctor who saved him was named Irwin, and hence the middle name. Though he was only 2 years old when Danny O'Keefe wrote \\"Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues\\" in 1967, it really could have been written about him. One of his nick names is Good Time Charlie, and the other is The Machine, which is partly due to his name being Sheen. At the trial of Heidi Fleiss he testified under oath that he spent over $50,000 on her high priced call girls. He is a notorious womanizer, boozer, and druggie, who has perhaps finally settled down, at least with regards to drugs and booze. At one point he almost died of a cocaine overdose, and he was in and out of rehab. Once he checked in for only a day.<br /><br />\\"One of my fondest memories is when Slash, from Guns N' Roses, sat me down at his house and said, `You've got to clean up your act.' You know you've gone too far when Slash is saying, `Look, you've got to get into rehab, you have to shut it down. You're going to die.' He's a terrific guy and I love him, he's a buddy of mine, but I had to step back from that situation and go, `Yeah, but you're Slash. Whaddya mean?' We'd been up for about four days. But I still heard him because a part of me was saying, `This isn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be. Something's missing.'\\"<br /><br />Platoon and Wall Street are so far his best film roles, but he has settled into a cozy career as a sit com actor, first on Spin City, and currently on Two and a Half Men, which is already in syndication, playing reruns twice a day Monday through Friday, while still making fresh episodes. The character is loosely based on himself, though one would think it is a very much watered down version. As with his role in Spin City, his characters always seem to be named Charlie.<br /><br />Continuing the father/son theme, actor Michael Douglas is the son of well-known actor Kirk Douglas. The elder Douglas is best known for his role as Spartacus.<br /><br />\\"I am Spartacus.\\"<br />\\"I am Spartacus.\\"<br />\\"I am Spartacus.\\"<br /><br />Michael Douglas had a breakthrough role as Inspector Steve Keller on the TV cop series The Streets of San Francisco. He played opposite veteran actor Karl Malden. He played some comedies and even played Zach in the movie version of A Chorus Line before playing in Fatal Attraction, in 1987, the same year as Wall Street, and Basic Instinct, in 1992. Recently there was a series on NPR (National Public Radio) of the most memorable characters from film and fiction, and Gordon Gekko was profiled. Premiere Magazine had a list of the 100 most memorable characters from film, and Gordon Gekko was #25. Michael Douglas won an Oscar for the role. Besides being married to the much younger (25 years) Catherine Zeta-Jones, his role as Gordon Gekko in Wall Street will no doubt be his legacy:<br /><br />Gordon Gekko: If you need a friend, get a dog.<br /><br />Gordon Gekko: The most valuable commodity Iknow of is information.<br /><br />Gordon Gekko: Greed captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.<br /><br />Gordon Gekko: I look at a hundred deals a day. I pick one.<br /><br />Gordon Gekko: Lunch is for wimps.<br /><br />Gordon Gekko: You're walking around blind without a cane, pal. A fool and his money are lucky enough to get together in the first place.<br /><br />Gordon Gekko: Ever wonder why fund managers can't beat the S&P 500? 'Cause they're sheep, and sheep get slaughtered.<br /><br />Gordon Gekko: [at the Teldar Paper stockholder's meeting] Well, I appreciate the opportunity you're giving me Mr. Cromwell as the single largest shareholder in Teldar Paper, to speak. Well, ladies and gentlemen we're not here to indulge in fantasy but in political and economic reality. America, America has become a second-rate power. Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions. Now, in the days of the free market when our country was a top industrial power, there was accountability to the stockholder. The Carnegies, the Mellons, the men that built this great industrial empire, made sure of it because it was their money at stake. Today, management has no stake in the company! All together, these men sitting up here own less than three percent of the company. And where does Mr. Cromwell put his million-dollar salary? Not in Teldar stock; he owns less than one percent. You own the company. That's right, you, the stockholder. And you are all being royally screwed over by these, these bureaucrats, with their luncheons, their hunting and fishing trips, their corporate jets and golden parachutes.<br />Cromwell: This is an outrage! You're out of line Gekko!<br />Gordon Gekko: Teldar Paper, Mr. Cromwell, Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents each earning over 200 thousand dollars a year. Now, I have spent the last two months analyzing what all these guys do, and I still can't figure it out. One thing I do know is that our paper company lost 110 million dollars last year, and I'll bet that half of that was spent in all the paperwork going back and forth between all these vice presidents. The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be survival of the unfittest. Well, in my book you either do it right or you get eliminated. In the last seven deals that I've been involved with, there were 2.5 million stockholders who have made a pretax profit of 12 billion dollars. Thank you. I am not a destroyer of companies. I am a liberator of them! The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed, you mark my words, will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA. Thank you very much.<br /><br />Gordon Gekko: Greed is good.<br /><br />This movie also had some other interesting characters/actors and character actors. John C. McGinley plays Marv, one of the other stock traders who works alongside Bud Fox. He is familiar as Dr. Perry Cox, the anti social doctor on TV sit com Scrubs. And Hal Holbrook is working there, too. Sylvia Miles plays a crass Real Estate Agent. She was nominated for an Oscar for Midnight Cowboy, and has been on the Hollywood/New York party scene for like ever. The best line about her was when someone name dropped that she would be at an art gallery opening, someone, can't remember who but if anyone does, please help me provide them with the proper credit, quipped: \\"Sylvia Miles would go to the opening of an envelope.\\" James Spader (Sex, Lies & Videotape) plays a lawyer friend of Bud's. He currently plays a lawyer on Boston Legal. Daryl Hannah plays a designer who is Bud's girlfriend, once he starts making money. She is secretly in bed with Gekko, though. Her biggest tabloid moment was when she was a back-up singer and girlfriend to Jackson Browne, and he allegedly got rough with her. Then John F. Kennedy Jr. reportedly came to her rescue. Daryl's breakout role was as the acrobatic, beautiful replicant Pris in Blade Runner (1982); Pris was the vixen who wanted to live beyond her allotted years.<br /><br />Segue to Sean Young, who was also in Blade Runner. What a classic movie, and was she ever great in it. I have always liked her, but she seems to attract ugly rumors like a magnet. She plays Kate Gekko in Wall Street, Gordon's wife. Her role was bigger at first, but during filming she rubbed Oliver Stone the wrong way. Whether that story is true or false, she is barely on screen long enough to register.<br /><br />In 1988, Young appeared in The Boost with James Woods. Woods later sued her for harassing both him and his then-fianc&eacute;e, alleging that Young left a disfigured doll on his doorstep in addition to other disruptive behavior. Young denied the allegations and claimed that Woods filed the lawsuit out of spite. Young stated, \\"It was a crush being turned down, that's all.... So sue me! And he [Woods] did.\\" The suit was settled out of court in 1989.<br /><br />In 1989, she was cast as Vicki Vale in Tim Burton's Batman. During rehearsals, she broke her arm after falling off a horse and was replaced by Kim Basinger. In an unsuccessful attempt to win the role as Catwoman (which ultimately went to Michelle Pfeiffer) in the sequel Batman Returns, Young constructed a homemade Catwoman costume and attempted to confront director Tim Burton and actor Michael Keaton during production.<br /><br />Young was fired from the 1990 movie Dick Tracy. Cast as Tess Trueheart, she was officially fired for not appearing maternal in the role. Young later claimed she was fired because she rebuffed Warren Beatty's advances (a claim Beatty denies).<br /><br />Sean Young appeared in Fatal Instinct, a parody of both Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction--take that, Michael Douglas.<br /><br />In January 2008, Young checked herself into rehab for alcohol abuse the day after an outburst at the Directors Guild of America awards in Los Angeles. Young was removed from the awards ceremony after repeatedly heckling director Julian Schnabel, who was onstage giving his remarks regarding his Best Director nomination for his work on the film, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.<br /><br />I hope Sean Young recovers from her problems. But if Charlie Sheen could do it, so can she.<br /><br />Even as we speak a writer is working on a sequel to Wall Street. Oliver Stone isn't involved, but Michael Douglas has agreed to reprise his role as Gordon Gekko. The title, which was used already for a documentary about the making of Wall Street, is Money Never Sleeps.<br /><br />Thanks to the Internet Movie Database and Wikipedia for the quotes and other biographical information.

006135323X|5.0|Dan Ariely is the guy you'd want at your dinner party. He's witty, smart and also very inclusive - sharing his passion for the way humans tick in a way that makes us feel great about the fact that, rational as we like to think we are, we make bad snap decisions, we cheat and we get ruled by our heart precisely when the facts are screaming \\"go the other way!\\" There's a lot in this writing which celebrates our human-ness. Why do we do this?<br />What Ariely has done here is shift a lot of the thinking developed by such pioneers as Kahneman & Tversky who worked in behavioural economics, and moved it into the everyday sphere. And he's done a great, insightful job. Where the behavioural economists are focused on financial decisions (why we buy high and sell low - and confound the assumptions of the classic economists who assume 'the rational man,) Ariely eschews the technical language and walks us through everyday examples of our often fuzzy and quite irrational decision-making.<br /><br />The result is utterly engaging - and this easy 300 page read still has academic rigour and strong foundations. Ariely cites many experiments and examples, and shows that we often get things wrong because we frame things the wrong way, mis-judge probabilities, apply heuristic rules of thumb that don't always work, or we just plain let our emotions rule.<br /><br />We love to think that we're educated, rational and moral. Yet who hasn't overestimated the upside on a sure-fire investment, bought some clothing that we knew was a mistake even as we bought it, or got our wires crossed between work-rules and social rules? This book is fascinating, entertaining and very, very illuminating.<br /><br />- Recommended for the general public, but I'd urge marketers, market researchers and business people to read this one carefully. Dan provides excellent dinner-party insights, but they apply to our real world and explain why so many poor decisions are made - whether by customers or by the 'rational' business people who make million-dollar decisions.<br /><br />- Recommended companion book: [[ASIN:0300122233 Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]] here one of the godfathers of behavioural economics discusses the way we can manage the \\"choice architecture\\" in our world.e million-dollar decisions.    - Recommended companion book: [[ASIN:0300122233 Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness]] here one of the godfathers of behavioural economics discusses the way we can manage the \\"choice architecture\\" in our world.
B000W4KT6E|1.0|I was not able to watch this DVD because it refuses to play on Linux.  If you want to watch a movie using Free Software, avoid this DVD.    It does work OK in a standard DVD player, so I did not return it (because the person I was giving it to owns a DVD player too.)
B00005JMK0|5.0|I have been looking for this movie on DVD everywhere and understand that it is not yet available.  I LOVE this movie!  It was fun and charming, poignant and sweet.

I read about the distortion in pictures when the camera goes over the Angel Fall and was hoping that I would not get that set of Discs and to my luck, I was one of the luck ones that actually got the better discs!   This documentary deserves a 5/5, but I am rating it 4 since it did NOT come with the Behind-the-scenes footage! Hopefully, the guys at BBC realize this and add the additional footage and give it to current owners of these discs for FREE(Too much to wish for....I know!)  Nevertheless, I would highly recommend this series to young and old alike!
0451219597|3.0|In the field of World War II historical novels, this is strictly  a commercial entry. I turned the pages, but I also felt Follett  searching to keep interest up (like with a female impersonator).  And as is too typical in the commercial fiction realm, these Nazis  are not very scary. Question for Mr. Follett: why do your Nazis  never have opinions about Jews, or Hitler, or anything else? No  matter, they only exist to add plot obstacles.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|I bought this mount at the same time as my purchase of the new BenQ G2400W monitor.  And, despite what others are saying about its ability to hold monitors of certain weight, it is doing just fine with the 24\\" BenQ right now.  I also took off the extension, as others have.  My desk just didn't warrant it.  The clamp holds tight to the desk.  The mounting plate worked perfectly.  And its great looking.  There really isn't much bad I can say about it.  Although it isn't a \\"negative\\" really, I wish there was some other method for cable management.  As is, it works fine.  And, no one ever sees behind my monitor really.  But, I just wish there were a cleaner way to route them.  But, that is a bit nit-picky.  It really is a fantastic mount.  And the price is just fine.  All in all, a great piece.
B000001FDK|5.0|I never, ever liked soundtracks. Because I usually never liked enough songs from movies!!! GREASE, though, is an exception! I bought it because I am part of the ensemble in a local production.<br /><br />There are so many gems! We have the fun ones: Summer Nights, Greased Lightning, Born to Hand Jive, We Go Together. These are famous! But, there's also one gem from the Boradway version: Rock N' Roll PArty Queen, sung by Louis St. Louis.<br /><br />There are also pretty, soulful songs: Sandy, There are Worse Things I Could Do. John Travolta and Stockard Channing add so much emotion to their \\"too cool for school\\" characters. I think many women could relate to Stockard's ballard- it isn't just for the \\"trashy and no good\\" girl of the 50s. However, don't skip over It's Raining on Prom Night, sung by the wonderful Cindy Bullens. This is a cute, sweet song about a girl whose prom night has been ruined by \\"the cruel force of nature from the blue\\".... \\"and the Asiatic flu\\". Poor thing, she \\"don't even have my coursage oh geez. It fell down the sewer with my sister's ID.\\"<br /><br />Finally, Those Magic Changes is an upbeat, touching love song about a teenager who is reminded of his love whenever he hears their song.<br /><br />This CD is perfect for parties, boring nights, nostalgia, and work-outs. Chang chang changity chang shoo bop!
B000VNMMQG|4.0|AMAZING GRACE is a historical film about William Wilburforce, a member of the British House of Commons, that leads the fight to eliminate the slave trade in the British Empire. Wilburforce is an amazing person and this film really doesn't do his life's work justice. But it does tell a good story and is a good starting point if you want to learn more about Wilburforce and the era in which he lived. At a young age, Wilburforce has a religious conversion and became an evangalical Christian. He felt called to serve God, and others convinced him that he could serve God by pushing for change in Parliment. A group of men, including ministers and an ex-slave met with Wilburforce and convinced him to take up their cause in Parliment to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire.<br /><br />Wilburforce faces an uphill battle because the economy of Britian is very dependent on the slave trade. He tries to gather evidence to support his cause while speaking to the House of Commons. He has chains, drawings of slave ships, eyewitness accounts and replicas of sleeping quarters. While all of this evidence is very persuasive to characters in the movie, I found it very uninspiring to me. I realize director Michael Apted's goal in the film was to make a movie about the legislative battles it took to abolish the slave trade (actual slavery was already illegal in England). The movie has very few black characters. I realize the horror of the slave trade could not be captured in such a brief moment in this film, but after hearing the descriptions of the way the slaves were treated and seeing a few reenactments of their treatment, I believe a few scenes depicting the horror of life on a slave ship would have been very effective and showing why Wilburforce was so motivated to abolish the slave trade.<br /><br />This movie had a top notch cast, great acting, and was very intellectually stimulating. Yet it failed to capture my heart. The flashback mode of storytelling seemed confusing and unneccessary, and as mentioned earlier, I never felt the true horror and suffering of the cause Wilburforce sacrificed so much of his life for. If anything, this is a movie to watch if you're interested in slavery and William Wilburforce. There is nothing too offensive in the movie, yet children would probably be bored to tears.  This is a movie that does a great job telling the story of how the slave trade was abolished in the British Empire. If you're looking for a movie about slavery and its affect on millions of Africans, you won't find it here. This movie is really about William Wilburforce, and the amazing life that he led.d as mentioned earlier, I never felt the true horror and suffering of the cause Wilburforce sacrificed so much of his life for. If anything, this is a movie to watch if you're interested in slavery and William Wilburforce. There is nothing too offensive in the movie, yet children would probably be bored to tears.

0451207521|3.0|In the field of World War II historical novels, this is strictly  a commercial entry. I turned the pages, but I also felt Follett  searching to keep interest up (like with a female impersonator).  And as is too typical in the commercial fiction realm, these Nazis  are not very scary. Question for Mr. Follett: why do your Nazis  never have opinions about Jews, or Hitler, or anything else? No  matter, they only exist to add plot obstacles. This novel is full  of activity, but not so much excitement.  Steve Wiggins, author of \\"Streets of Warsaw\\"  [[ASIN:0974543500 Streets of Warsaw: A Novel of the Polish Resistance in World War II]]
0312321376|3.0|Dr Tucker revisits stories described by Dr Ian Stevenson.    His analysis didn't shed any new light on these stories that I saw in Stevenson's works.    I would suggest Stevenson's \\"Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation\\" over this book. This suggestion saddens me because I want Dr Stevenson's work to continue. Dr Tucker is doing the work in his place and I wish him well.
B000784WMW|5.0|Timothy Dalton is great as Mr. Rochester. At first I thought he would be too handsome, but he was so into the character that his looks weren't noticeable. However I think that Zelah Clarke was not as good as Ruth Wilson (masterpiece theatre) as Jane Eyre. Still I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Yes I did read the book.
B000TGJ80I|5.0|I'm not going to review the film itself (but if you must know, I think it's freaking awesome - which is readily apparent, considering I have the regular dvd, the extended unrated cut dvd, and now this blu-ray version).      Now, onto the disk itself.  First, the cut of this movie seems to be the extended unrated cut, or something similar to it, so if you missed out on that the first go around, this is your chance to see it.      The transfer, in my humble opinion, is absolutely lovely.  Everything looked great on my 60 inch Sony Bravia.  I especially love how much additional kick the blue-ish color palette (chosen intentionally by the director) receives in this transfer.      If you haven't seen this movie yet (shame on you)...and you have a blu-ray player, this is the version I recommend you to get.  If you are just like me, who just plain loves the movie, then double dipping IMO is well worth it.

630542828X|4.0|(1) A Civil Action is a 1998 film, starring John Travolta (as plaintiff's attorney Jan Schlichtmann) and Robert Duvall, based on the book of the same name by Jonathan Harr. Both the book and the film  are based on the real-life case of Anderson v. Cryovac that took place in Woburn, Massachusetts in the 1980s.    (2) John Travolta plays a tort lawyer part of  tort law firm making millions from large corporations by filing personal injuries on behalf of their clients.     (3) He is intellectually attracted (seeing the the financial jackpot and oppurtunity to make millions for his firm and partners) to a case about a large corporation polluting the waters of a small town which incidentally shows a high rise of deaths due to cancer.    (4) Travolta law firm tries to proove that the deaths due the cancer of the many residents of that down were actually due to the consumption of the water from the river where the toxic waste from the company were dumped.     (5) In a surprising move , and totally against his nature he decides against taking a reasonably sizable sum of money as settlement (from the corporation) on behalf of the town dwellers to end the case there which would have left Travolta and his partners with sizable monies and would have also left his clients some money. But the clients are not after money, they are after truth and want justice to be served against the large corporation.     (6) The  culprit in question are actually 2 companies of which Robert Duvall is the attorney for one of the companies.    (6) Having turned down the offer and having decided to go on the righteous route of litigations for justice and truth, he sinks his whole law firm into bankruptcy fighting the case; His partners leave him (one of whom is William H Macy)    (7) ' An underdog against the large corporation' film    I won't call it the best legal thriller of our times like the DVD jacket proclaims, but it is certainly an above par legal thriller churned out of Hollywood. Travoltasurprisingly suits the role very well.      regards, Vikram
0143038419|5.0|I'd seen this book on the bookstore shelf and top sellers lists for a while and had always assumed that it was a hippie dippy account of an overwrought spiritual journey to which I could never relate.

I quickly finished the book, inspired and extremely pleased to have read something so well written, witty, and insightful. I am looking forward to reading her other books and stories.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|The original Shrek was a CG classic or masterpiece.  It's truly a work of art in the computer graphics field.  The detail in the CGI was AMAZING for its time and it still manages to impress me today.  Other animated films like \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"Monsters Inc\\" compare to the beautiful composure, however Shrek is dominantly more humourous.<br /><br />The movie just has the word clever written all over it.  It can definately satisfy a group of young children while also managing to get some adults to laugh hysterically.  With this in mind I would advise some parents to view the content before having their children view the film.  There is some suggestive material and curse words hidden througout the film.  Most parents I've known have avoided showing this film to young children, so if you are one of those kinds of parents, I advise you to have them view some of the Disney films instead. Remember Disney did not make this film.<br /><br />The voice-overs are great.  Some films have tried to make a great voice-over team and sadly failed.  Murphy, Myers, and Diaz definately raised the bar and set an example for CGI movies to come.  So pretty much what makes this movie work is the talent, humor, and clever animation.<br /><br />So if you haven't seen this film, pay some tribute to American filmmaking and get this American Classic.  It was a huge success because it was such an original and fun film.  Don't miss it for the world.

B00006AVRK|4.0|Buying the complete series is a much better value than buying seasons individually.  Whether you are familiar with the books or not, I think anyone can like this series, especially if you like the genre of British humor.  The only downside I can think of is there is no captioning or subtitles.  This is a particular negative for this series becuase there is a lot of clever word play, but the accents and sound quality make it diffuclt to always fully capture.
B001041JLE|3.0|This is a classic album reissued for money with a couple of \\"remixes\\".  Sony/CBS should have remastered and issued in DTS 96/24 5.1 surround format.  Just imagine the 9 songs including Thriller,Beat it,Billie Jean,Human Nature comming from all round the room and the effects.  Now that would be an album worth re-buying just for DTS surround and a must for any collection.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|This was one of my favorite TV shows when it came out in 1969. The variety of the stars are fantastic. Country to Gospel to Rock to Jazz to Folk. Johnny was an excellent host for all genre. I met him him once & his presence in the room was unbelievable. He wasn't 10 feet tall, but he might as well have been! I just wish they would release every one of his episodes, I think sales on that boxed set would be a record breaker.  DCB
B000053VAZ|5.0|Wanted to share this movie with a friend, even though it's an older movie, I knew Amazon would have it!

0375842381|5.0|I was longing for a good series of fantasy books ever since I finished Stephen King's \\"The Black Tower\\" series. Peter Pullman created a beautiful and very believable alternate reality and was able to sew the whole plot together without any big glitches (feat that King fell short with \\"The Black Tower\\"). I would dare say it's almost as good as Tolkien's \\"The Lord of The Rings\\".

B000VDDDY6|4.0|Just as Toshiba has cancelled the production of HD-DVD, and the release of the remastered seasons 2 and 3 has been cancelled in HD-DVD, my honest advise is to hold back, wait until the dust is settled down and expect (or more likely, hope) for a future Blu-Ray release of the remastered original series. Of course, as Toshiba was paying for the remastering, this could most likely take years, if ever.
B000009RC2|5.0|I'm 44 years old.  I stumbled across this CD at a pawn shop, having heard of the band before but never having heard their music.  Before listening to this disc, if you'd asked me my impressions of the genre \\"jazz fusion,\\" my response would have been as much visible as audible: reverse peristalsis.  (For purposes of full disclosure, 90% of what I listen to is classical, although I also love an eclectic mix of other things, including 1970s punk, 1960s bossa nova and 1950s country).  I cast my 5 stars vote with the overwhelming positive lovefest of other reviewers, and to it humbly ask -- is this (among other things) not the most perfect music to get stoned to?  I would go so far as to suggest it's almost as good for that purpose as Iron Butterfly's \\"In a Gadda Davida.\\"  I haven't lit up in close to a quarter of a century, but this makes me positively CRAVE the stuff. Just listening to these licks practically makes me trip.  Maybe that's the point, or at least part of it.
3832791620|3.0|Des Hill has it exactly right in his review of this book.  Every single one of his points is one that I would've made, though probably not as well.

B000XRG9IW|2.0|There are a few really cool things about this album, but the unfocused songwriting and female warble on vocals take it down a notch. The retro-keyboard sound and a strong drum performnce keep this album afloat, but it simply does not live up to the great media-created expectations. The extended jams on this cd are boring and unfocused, and while the female vocals serve well as backups, when she is allowed to sing lead, it falls somewhere in between Grace Slick (the good) and a wounded animal (the bad). This would have been a better record if the male lead sang the entire thing.
B00005K9QP|5.0|When this first came out (LP), anyone who played guitar HAD to have this.  While Clapton had played in the Yardbirds, few really noticed his solos at the time.  Instead, he seemed to come from nowhere preceded by his \\"Guitar God\\" reputation.  We largely tuned out Mayall's voice and the horns and just focused on the guitar work.  I listened to this repeatedly until I could hear it note-for-note in my mind's ear.  It was, and still is, Clapton's best work.  It was, and still is, among the very best electric-guitar-blues playing ever recorded (I love SRV and Mike Bloomfield, too).  Every cut on which Clapton plays is a gem and a masterpiece (except the one featuring the drummer where not much else happens).  [And, frankly, the 2 featuring Mayall's harmonica and no guitar are rather good in their own right.]    But, again, the incredible guitar work alone, all the other reviewers' complaints notwithstanding, is enough to warrant 5 stars and the purchase price to add this to your collection.  Just focus on the guitar.  40 years later, I am still amazed.  It would definitely be in my \\"desert island juke box.\\"
B000OVLBHG|5.0|Besides the fact that the title of my review has nothing whatsoever to do with my opinion of this film I thought Starship Troopers was an outstanding sci-fi movie which obviously and (I believe) intentionally oversimplifies the position it appears to take on the value of being a \\"true soldier\\".<br /><br />Nobody should read too much into the politics and just enjoy the great action, outstanding special effects and competent acting. I rate this movie at 5+ stars and hope to see the likes of it again. The scale and scope of the large screen CGI effects for huge fleets of starships looked absolutely authentic and would make any pacifist proud to witness the display of military power (at least for the duration of this film).<br /><br />I recent watched this film on my large screen HDTV for the first time. I was amazed by the color, clarity, sharpness, and good general definition. All of the great effects and action were transferred to DVD beautifully regardless of how staged (i.e., computer generated or live action). What a geat DVD transfer.  I can only imagine what this film would be like in Blue Ray.<br /><br />I really didn't know at the time I saw the movie anything about its origins and thought the political background was a simple construct assembled for the sake of the movie.  It was so simply stated that I trust most viewers didn't take it too seriously.  I don't know what the writers may have believed, but as far as the film was concerned it came on as a science fiction movie from start to finish.<br /><br />I also felt that the CGI images were enormously original on a scope which has been achieved only by a few sci-fi movies.  In addition, the basic design and computer effects for the warrior bugs were absolutely outstanding and for my money were only surpassed by Giger's vision for the Alion.

Its a great movie to have the girls over to watch!
032147404X|4.0|This book gets to the short and sweet, most of the time. Kelby still injects his \\"humor\\" but thankfully it's a lot less than previous books. Perhaps he is taking the hint from online reviews? I doubt it, not with that ego. Anyways, an excellent source of quick reference info for the beginner or intermediate photographer. For me it was well worth the money spent. Each page covers 1 \\"tip\\" in its respective chapter. Due to this sort of \\"efficiency\\" this book is one you can put into your camera bag and take along with you for a quick reference guide. 4.5 Stars.
B000683VI4|5.0|I love this movie, everything about it. It makes me cry everytime I watch it. It allows you to be hopeful if your single, makes you feel blessed if your with someone you love, and just makes you cherish moments with loved ones. This is a movie i can watch over and over, and still feel the same way about it afterwards. Granted it isnt a movie that men are raving about, but as a woman i can say that this movie de stresses me, and makes me feel good about  my life.
B000007489|5.0|I'm so old, I had this cassette when I was in high school. I was one of the white suburban punks  who discovered this band on the Repo Man soundtrack. I haven't dragged the CD out in 10 years and now at the tender age of 40, I can't believe how FANTASTIC this thing is! It sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday.<br /><br />You kids today should thank the rock gods for this band. They were doing what you are now hearing in 1983!
1423321650|4.0|This is the continuation in the Sword of Truth, a Might Magic type story. This saga is definitely an adult subject due to the graphic discription of some of the scenes. I would not recommend it for a younger child.   It is an excellent audio book.  The reader, Jim Bond, does a wonderful job of changing his voice to mimic the different characters as he goes through the story, keeping the listener engaged in the saga.  However, in the unabridged set that I recieved the disc marked 12 is actually a copy of the 10th disc.  I was able to speak to the publisher's representative, who will be sending out a replacement to me.

B000DWMN2S|5.0|This is one those movies I started to watch and thought, \\"What the heck?!\\"  Quickly, though, this movie tightened its grip and charmed me into loving it.  I only know one person who wasn't CRAZY about \\"Everything is Illuminated,\\" and she's hard to impress, anyway.  All the characters are so quirky, but you have to love them.  Great blend of funny and sad. I recommend it to everyone.
0143038419|1.0|How can someone without a soul go soul searching?  What can be said about an author who claims she has always been tempted to greet God with, \\"Love your work!;)\\" What might be irreverent in others is snarky and self-conscious twittering from this 'woman' who dumped her husband, battled in divorce court for the heck of it for three years (with no children or assets in the balance) and finally decided to recover from her self-inflicted ordeal by getting an advance from a publisher so she could ricochet in style from one boho hot spot to another. All without noticing anyone else or pondering anything more profound than her lingerie.  This is nothing but a how-to book on becoming a low-rent Paris Hilton, a new-style ugly American. So what can be said for the sometimes amusing but always cynical, graceless and self-serving Ms. Gilbert?  Niente; arnAstatva; Kosong. And what can she say to us?  Nothing; Nada; zip.   Liking this book is a warning to get  a life, a mind and a conscience!
B0000640VN|3.0|I hate chick flicks, normally. They are extremely predictable, sappy, boring and overly sweet. However, what makes this one different is, it uses time travel, and it has Hugh Jackman. I am going to completely ignore Meg Ryan because she is unimportant in this. Hugh Jackman is what makes this movie, and really, is the only reason to see it. He is so flawlessly elegant and suave in this. Its almost like he's not even acting. It's extremely charming. Like I said, the film deals with time travel, but it is in no way a sci-fi film. It is still a chick flick and yes, still predictable, BUT not as sappy or boring. It has its ups and downs.
B00003CXS4|5.0|You don't see many movies like Snatch. There really isn't a genre to put this in. There is so much going on at one time, yet its never confusing. Plus, there are quite a few important characters to keep track of, and they all have their own proper place in this film. Even with 1 less actor, it would seem incomplete. This movie flows perfectly. Basically, the plot sort of revolves around a large diamond. Its not necessarily a heist film. Nor is it a 100% comedy, though, you gotte love that British humour. And no, Brad Pitt isn't a main character, however, he is a great, essential character. There are actually quite a few different nationalities in this film. Its all very interesting, how all the characters interact with one another, bantering, or threatening each other. Its alot of fun. The movie has a great soundtrack as well that really adds to the mood of the film. Its really an impressive film that would appeal to many people.
B00005JPLW|3.0|In 480 B.C., the Battle of Thermopylae was a precursor of the more familiar Battle of the Alamo in 1836. Both were examples of how a small battalion of men was able to fend off a much larger army by a combination of resourcefulness, fortitude and sheer will. However, the scale of Thermopylae was far more dramatic as 300 Spartans under King Leonidas held at bay for three days over a quarter million Persians under Xerxes the Great. Directed with technical flourish by Zack Snyder, this visually elaborate 2007 action film is a fictionalized retelling of that momentous event as it was vividly envisioned in Frank Miller's [[ASIN:1569714029 1999 graphic novel]]. Similar to the 2005 adaptation of Miller's [[ASIN:B00005JNTX Sin City]], a constant parade of striking, often gory images is what drives the momentum of the screenplay co-written by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad and Michael P. Gordon. However, unlike that story and more similarly, Ridley Scott's [[ASIN:B00009ZYBY Gladiator]], a coherent narrative flow and a more involving sense of character development are lacking to a significant degree.<br /><br />The net result is a stylish piece of juvenile pop entertainment but hardly more substantive than a typical Italian sword-and-sandal picture from the early 1960's. Things start promisingly as we are presented with a cursory overview of Leonidas' fate as King of Sparta when he is separated from his mother at age seven to undergo the rigorous training necessary to have the courage and bloodlust of a true leader. The problem is that Snyder keeps painting the story's mythological aspects with broader and broader brushstrokes. Dialogue takes on a contemporary, almost comical tone that makes it difficult to take seriously the gravity of the events depicted. The battle scenes, especially an overindulgent use of slow motion, are equally outlandish with the gore so exaggerated and figures so grotesque (like the Uber-Immortal) that it makes it difficult to understand or even care about the motivations behind the characters' actions. Everything is larger than life and so lacking in detail and nuance that all the actors can do is accommodate the over-stylized treatment.<br /><br />The pumped-up, half-clothed bodies match up well with the comic book sensibilities on display here, chief among them Gerard Butler, who is ideally cast as Leonidas. It's not a complex role, but even with his distinctively Scottish brogue, he has no problem showcasing the nobility, stubbornness and mocking cockiness necessary to be leading such an audaciously fatalistic military strategy. Made up like a bejeweled NY-glam boy, Rodrigo Santoro seems less than a match for the commanding Leonidas as the seemingly omnipotent, seven-foot Xerxes. Better is Lena Headey as the Spartan queen Gorgo, whose devotion to Leonidas goes unabated in home front scenes, where she has to fend off the advances of the dastardly Theron while begging the state council to send more troops. The rest of the cast really doesn't register much beyond the epic film stereotypes they are playing, including David Wenham's obligatory turn as the narrator Dilios. It takes a certain artistry to provide grace and power to a story mythologized from a real event, but it appears most of the filmmakers' efforts lie on the surface.<br /><br />The two-disc 2007 DVD package should make fans palpitate with glee. Disc One has the best extra - the constantly informative commentary track from Snyder with periodic contributions from Johnstad and director of photography Larry Fong. There is no doubt Snyder did a lot of research, and he is extremely forthcoming with the behind-the-scenes details, which in this case, is very helpful. Disc Two contains a lot of small extras, the most prominent being the mostly intriguing 24-minute \\"300 Spartans: Fact or Fiction?\\", in which Miller, Snyder and historians discuss the painstaking detail as well as the liberties taken with this interpretation of the actual battle. Another historicallyoriented short and a brief making-of featurette are also included, as well as a quick short on the translation of the blue-screen images. Miller is interviewed separately in one fifteen-minute piece, and there is a multi-chapter Web production diary, which seems to be a more common feature on DVD sets these days.ief making-of featurette are also included, as well as a quick short on the translation of the blue-screen images.

B0000BWVCM|4.0|Super hero movies can be rather tough to watch. They are either very good (Superman) or very bad (The Hulk). X-Men 2, is probably my favorite Super Hero film. It doesn't even compare to the first movie. That is so rare for a sequel. Aside from Halle Berry, the rest of the cast is enjoyable and fun to watch. We really get to delve deeper into their universe and deeper into certain characters. We learn more about Wolverine, Prof X, and Jean Grey, just some of my favorite characters. Nightcrawler is also a fun new character. The plot is quite interesting and engaging. Once the film gets going, there is plenty of suspense and action and romantic intrigue. Its a perfectly paced film and, like I mentioned, leaps and bounds better than X-Men.
B000002HMH|2.0|but if you're like me and have been listening to metallica for 20 years or so this is complete garbage compared to other releases. If somebody else would have released this record I would of liked it much more but I feel it did not live up to Metallica's standard of greatness. So, if you start with Load and you like that, then get Reload then the Black record and work your way into the older stuff. And Justice for all, Ride the lightning, and Master of Puppets are must owns' this record is not. If your looking for And justice For All again or the Black record skip this. Thanks for your time and enjoy the ride.
B000PC1N54|1.0|This is Zeffirelli at his very worst. An incredibly tasteless and vulgar production, with more cheap gold than anyone could bear in a casino show and without a single original idea about the staging of this wonderful but overexposed opera. The level of incompetence is hard to beleive and La Scala has reached a new low in its undistinguished recent history. The Orchestra sounds very good, but Alagna is uncomfortable as Radames, with a voice inadequate for the role, although he does try. Urmana is somewhat better, but it isn't enough. To make things worse the video producer thinks he can improve this sad event with silly camera movements and very distressing close-ups of the fabrics of every costume! Do yourself a favour and totally ignore this release.

0374105235|5.0|This story is simply told. There are no fancy literary flourishes designed to manipulate the reader's emotions and no eloquent explanations designed to sway us to a particular viewpoint. It is the simple story of a child unwittingly caught up in the appalling violence of civil war. The narrator tells his own story. It is the story of how civil war destroys the normality of life in his village, of how he runs from the advancing violence, but eventually cannot avoid being drafted into its very heart as a child soldier. He describes the process of desensitization that allows him to survive the horrors he participates in and the even more difficult process of learning to re-engage with civil society once he has been rescued from the battlefield.     Some readers may be disappointed by the fact that the book provides only very limited historical background to the conflict in Sierra Leone and by the fact that the narrator engages in only very limited introspection about what he has experienced. The plot also contains a few scenes that come across as a bit contrived and unlikely, but none of this detracts from the picture that is painted of the horrors of child soldiers involved in civil war. The power of the story lies in its simplicity and in the fact that we know it is being told by someone who lived through it.

B000IJ7Q32|5.0|How societies manage ecological change may determine whether they continue to exist and thrive and flourish.  Science involves the acquisition of reliable knowledge.  Easter Island collapsed for purely ecological reasons.      Farming, mining, and logging in Montana are subject to shrinking profit margins.  Half of Montana's citizens' means of existence comes from activities outside of the state.      Easter Island, sixty-six square miles, has a mild climate.  It is a windy place.  It has limited rainfall and fresh water supplies.  At Easter Island the inhabitants were Polynesian, (on the basis of linguistic and cultural analysis), and were isolated.  The island had been settled last.  More statues were produced there because the materials were better.  Formerly Easter Island had a dense forest.  With deforestation there was no material to build sea-going canoes.  A population crash, starvation, ensued.  A European visiting in 1722 observed a wholly deforested island.      In Mesoamerican there was a Mayan collapse but people were still around to fight the Spanish.  Mayan warfare was intense.  There was drought.  Also, too many farmers had been growing too many crops on too much of the landscape.  There was deforestation and erosion.      Viking expansion to North America led to the environmentally triggered collapse of the Greenland settlement.  From trading, Scandanavians moved to raiding.  They became Vikings.  Vikings were pushed by population growth.  Raids in Europe declined as effective defenses were mounted.  Iceland and Greenland were discovered.  In terms of ecology, Iceland is the most heavily damaged country in Europe.  Original trees and vegetation are gone, the soil is eroded.      The Greenland venture failed over a period of four hundred fifty years.  Surprisingly, the Greenland Norsemen didn't eat fish.  They were left short of lumber, fuel, and iron in Greenland.  Soil erosion, turf-cutting, and grazing damage were problems.  The Norse preferred cows to sheep and goats who fit into the environment more easily.  The Norse failed to develop trade with the Inuit and failed to learn from them.      Burundi and Rwanda were scenes of genocide in 1994 and were also places of overpopulation and ecological disaster.  Before 1994 levels of violence were rising.      The most populous country is China.  Its environmental problems are severe.  The air pollution problem is notorious.  China is one of the most forest-poor countries.  Australia is confronted with challenges, too.      The book uses a number of cases to illustrate geographical failures in a variety of situations.  It is effectively argued that multi-national companies need to be compelled to clean-up the environmental ills created by their enterprises.  Notwithstanding its scientific bent and the level of detail it contains,  the book remains throughout an  interesting and lively experience for the general reader.  An extensive section listing additional reading is included.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|Actually, let's give Michael Apted's \\"Amazing Grace\\" 4.5 stars and let's look at the strengths of the film first.<br /><br />First, when you start with a plot about the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, and intertwine, accurately, historic characters such as Fox, Pitt the Younger, Tarelton, and the Duke of Clarence, you are starting with a strong story.  Focus on the main character--MP William Wilberforce and his indefatigable efforts, and you have a winner.<br /><br />Next, work with the copious records and documents to stay historically faithful.  Throw in Wilberforce's strong relationship with John Newton, a former slave ship captain turned cleric, and author of the title hymn.  How can you miss?<br /><br />This film's greatest virtue besides the great historic tale is the fine acting. Ioan Gruffudd as Wilberforce is supplemented by many of the finest talents of British Cinema including Albert Finney as Newton, Rufus Sewell, Nicholas Farrell, and Toby Jones. The script crackles, allowing them all to display their talents.<br /><br />If the film has a technical weak point, it is it's odd use of flashbacks, flash forwards and strange \\"two years later\\" time increments.  It's a little hard to follow, but not unwatchable at all.<br /><br />If there is a historic weak point of the film, it has to be \\"Where's Wesley?\\"  John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church was mainly remembered when he died in 1803 as a premier fighter against slavery in the UK.  Living contemporaneously with Wilberforce, not even giving him a mention seems a major historic omission.<br /><br />But, otherwise, great, inspirational entertainment.  Good cinematography and soundtrack round out a top film worthy of repeated watchings.
B000002UAR|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! The Beatles so-called transitional album (going from a touring group to a studio only group) is one of their most creative. This album marks where they began experimenting in the studio, expanding their sound that would culminate with Sgt. Pepper's. Revolver was a #1 album & had two singles released from it, \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" that peaked at #11 & \\"Yellow Submarine\\" that peaked at #2. (I realize I'm reviewing the U.K. version of the album & that the U.S. version was different.) Esomewhat later.) The album cover also is one of the most unique ever done, it's artist is Klaus Voorman who would later play bass for Lennon on his early solo releases.    The album begins one of George Harrison's best songs \\"Taxman\\", it has a great riff with guitar & bass playing in unison. Most people don't realize it but it's McCartney that plays the lead guitar in this song. This was a song that could have been released as a single, it still receives a lot of airplay. \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is next, it's a McCartney song & was unusual in their catalog because it only features McCartney on lead vocal, & Lennon & Harrison on background harmonies. None of the Beatles played any instruments on this song which was the second time this had happened; the first being another McCartney composition \\"Yesterday\\". \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" follows & isn't a standout song. \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" is a great ballad & actually has lyrics by Paul that make sense. \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is next, a novelty song written mostly by Paul & given to Ringo to sing. It's a catchy singalong with a lot of things going on in the background. \\"She Said She Said\\" is another song that doesn't standout in this collection. Then comes \\"Good Day Sunshine\\", a n upbeat song that still gets a lot of airplay. \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" is next, once again a song that doesn't live up to many of the other songs that are here. Same thing for \\"For No One\\" & Doctor Robert\\". Then comes another Harrison composition \\"I Want to Tell You\\". G\The next song features a horn combo, \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\", a song that has a slight jazz quality to it & another song that could have been released as a single. The album ends with the frightening & very experimental \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". This is Lennon's best composition on the album. Lennon would later disown this recording but I find it to be one of the best things he ever did. There's a lot of experimentation on this album,in fact, in every song though some experiments are more obvious than some. The Beatles were doing many things at this time that hadn't been done in a studio before. One of the most amazing things about this album was the number of song styles that's covered here; all the way from baroque to pure psychedelic & they did each one equally well.    There is some filler here, mostly by Lennon, but it's great that we have the U.K. version instead of the illegitimate children that Capitol passed off onto the domestic market. I agree with some that this is NOT one of the best albums that they ever did, I reserve that for The White Album & Abbey Road. The one thing about the Beatles, though, was you never knew exactly what you were getting until you played it, which always made it entertaining!
B00005JKES|5.0|David Lynch is a genius. A mini series is a very difficult genre because each episode is rather long and must end with some unsolved suspense. Moreover altogether it is many hours on one single essential piece of suspense and it runs the risk of getting boring, of slowing down and of losing interest for the audience. What's more that genre is used quite a lot on American television with the soap operas. That miniseries also runs the risk of being compared today with the film, and of course it is. The film is short, dynamic and to the point all the time, perfectly concentrating on one single line of suspense. So what can David Lynch do to rejuvenate the genre, to regenerate the rules and inspiration of that genre? He does a lot and that's where he becomes a genius.  First he embeds in his own miniseries short scene of a standard soap opera as the counterpoint of his own work. Then he multiplies allusions, visual or not, text or images or music, to many other series and authors. For one example the appearing of a black raven here and there is similar to the use of that animal in some of Stephen King's films or books. But these allusions are never comical, never derogatory. They are always there to provide the film with more depth, a cultural depth that I call a cultural ellipse. Those who see the ellipse get to that depth. Those who don't see it don't miss anything in the meaning of the film itself. But the best part of this series is the way the actors are directed. The scenes are systematically banal, standard, very trite even, especially the dialogue, and these scenes and these dialogues have been used many times in many TV series or films. But the actors are directed in such a way that the satire that could appear in these scenes is totally defused because the actors play them in an absolutely serious, truthful and even sincere way. Finally the various episodes are so inventive in surprises and even shocking revelations that we are really taken along in quite a dynamic way. So that watching the series after the film is quite interesting because of all the levels the film was obliged to push aside and that are developed here in full length, particularly all the elements showing the ugliness of life in this small community torn apart by rivalries and hatreds among the people, especially those who have some responsibility as for the future of the community itself. So get to it and enjoy it, especially if you like the succulent and over-ripe style that David Lynch uses so often.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesnamic way.

After all, they are supposed to be able to hold much more than regular DVD.  News Update!!!!!!!!!2/19/2008 The battle is over.

Feb. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Toshiba Corp. abandoned its HD DVD technology, surrendering the high-definition video market to Sony Corp.'s Blu-ray in the entertainment industry's largest format war since VHS beat Betamax in the 1980s.
B000002KCI|5.0|Zuma is certainly one of the best Young/Crazy Horse studio recordings. \\"Don't Cry No Tears,\\" is a great rock song, with lots of sting. \\"Cortez the Killer\\"  contains some of Neil's best extended rifs, and the lyrics are among his best: poetic and political at the same time. This recording gets some of my most frequent IPOD replays, and I have most of Young's records on the hard drive.
B0011NT4FM|5.0|I was actually quite a fan of the Japanese digipak release on Universal - although some reviewers did ask questions about its sound quality. To my 56 year old low fidelity ears though, the sound was always fine - I was just so relieved that someone had had the courage to authorise the use of the original magnificent cover. Where this latest one from Repertoire wins is in the quality of the artwork. The text and illustrations appear much more clearly than they do on the Japanese release and in keeping with Repertoire's policy, there is the bonus of an informative little booklet. The theme of the album (that of three schoolfriends who become separated in adult life) seems to acquire ever greater poignancy as the years spin by. Kerry Minnear's 'Schooldays' recalls as though through a dream, the seemingly endless summer of childhood whilst the title (and closing) track would not be out of place performed in a cathedral. At their best, Gentle Giant combined Medieval, Renaissance and Jazz influences with hard rock in a way that made them masters of the progressive genre. What made them extra special was their talent for giving their music an icing of deeply thought provoking lyrics.
B000MG1ZFQ|3.0|By far the weakest of the releases with Jim Morrison, the addition (overproduction) of horns and strings cannot bolster the uneven set, released in 1969, with guitarist Robbie Krieger contributing an unusually large number of tracks.<br /><br />The highlights are Touch Me and Tell All The People - outstanding pop selections - which sustain the surreal quality of the band's music/lyrics. Wild Child is Morrison poking fun at his pop-culture persona - a wity parody of himself - but the plodding title track typifies a band that has hit a creative rut.<br /><br />The six bonus tracks make it more intriguing, but even the most legendary bands have a couple rough spots in its discography. Rain briefly fell on this parade, but The Doors were poised to deliver some creative fire in 1970 and 1971.
B000Z6MIQS|4.0|I would actually give this album 3.5 stars, but I'm willing to give them the benefit-of-the-doubt here. I agree with the general assessment of some of the other reviewers that this album is a significant departure from their previous 2 albums, but whether or not this is truly a bad thing depends a little on your assessment of their work thus far.    On the whole, I have to say this album is infinitely more mature than their prior efforts. They eschew the downright juvenile content of said albums which was a major source of criticism, and they similarly seem to be distancing themselves slightly from the heavily \\"emo,\\" Goth-teen overtones of their earlier albums. I realize this is a good deal of what people expect from Pierre et al., so this is likely to rub a few hardcore fans the wrong way. But, as someone who simply likes their music for its sound, and has never identified with any of the content, I find this to be a neutral change.    On the negative side, I have to say that I do find in this an overall (unrelated) deterioration in the quality of the music from a pop standpoint. The hooks just aren't there like they were in \\"Pads, Helmets, Balls,\\" and the instrumental work isn't as crisp as it was back then. They're beginning to sound less like *them,* and more like some imaginary generic rock band. I agree that some of the tracks sound overproduced, and feel this is responsible for a good deal of these changes-for-the-worse.    The bottom line: I honestly don't know whether or not I would recommend this album to the SP faithful. It's simply too different from their older work to draw any continuity with much of it. Having said that, it's still a good album on its own merits; I did give it an unofficial 3.5 stars. Whether the change is because they're finally growing up or have simply undergone a profound shift of style is irrelevant: it still sound good.
B000E1YVZU|3.0|The musical RENT is a film adaptation of a Broadway play. I've recently seen a pretty dang good Chicago production of it. It's got no shortage of heart, lots of energy, and lots of laughs and tears. It's also got some weaknesses that are precariously close to being its death blow. Its flaws don't kill it, but they come close.    The performances are absolutely amazing. I don't have a single critical thing to say about any of the actors.    Musically, I know this music has made the global rounds and it's huge. I don't think there's anything bad to say about the musical score either.    But looking critically at RENT, both as a story and as a film, reveals glaring flaws that keep me personally from falling head-over-heels in love with it and becoming a full-fledged RENT-head. This story has some problems that are both unfortunate and major, paradoxically leaving me with a sense of disingenuousness. Which doesn't make sense considering its origin, where it came from, Larson. I shouldn't be able to call 'BS' on RENT and be justified, and yet I can.    RENT assumes rather than earns its authenticity.    RENT has an unflinching, unapologetic self-centeredness that both serves it and cripples it. It has devoted so much focus and effort into being Gen-X'y, bohemian, and anti-establishment, that it has overlooked having a genuine identity of its own. Its uniqueness is stereotypical. It's confined to its freedom. Its portrayal of village artists and photographers is obvious, clunky, one-dimensional, cliché. The film is far too self-congratulatory to even consider noticing this.    RENT is trying (plaintively?) to make its characters' last year on Earth a celebration, but the thing is, I feel like a terrible situation of tremendous gravity, urgency, and despair has been turned into something of a 3-ring circus. On some level I feel like I have to question how seriously this was meant to be taken. Only its origin saves it from being creatively bankrupt. The exact same story coming from any Hollywood writer would rightfully get burned at the stake. Ultimately, these decisions ARE Larson's prerogative. I guess that being homeless and your imminent AIDS-related death doesn't automatically require an uptight documentary-style treatment.    RENT's excessive prettiness is also a big detriment to the film's authenticity, honestly. These people are awfully beautiful to be homeless AIDS victims. These are all designer characters. Their appearance is a deliberate, calculated, manicured image designed to make the idea more digestible. I rather suspect some watch this so they can feel like they've adopted some of the suffering of an underprivileged group of people. Do those individuals spend any actual time with the homeless? Who's to say. This mentality has infected other visual aspects of the film, too. Everything is so manicured and staged it becomes false. Everything is designer and Hollywood and perfect, including--nay, ESPECIALLY the abandoned buildings and alleys. The cinematography is a technical masterpiece and everything happens much too perfectly for me to believe in the world of RENT. It's not to be unexpected in a musical, but the nature of the subject matter changes the game quite a bit. Would I apply that equally to all films everywhere? Unfortunately, we're in the territory of art criticism here and it's subjective--and context matters, so no. For instance, Chicago has all the exact same traits, but they work for the film it instead of against it. And, say, a maverick cop out to kick some butt lacking authenticity is an entirely different ball game than being fake about THIS.    The entire scene with Sarah Silverman is the epitome of what I'm talking about. It fails to be the stark contrast with the rest of the film that it's trying to be. Furthermore, the entire subplot is an absurd non sequitur, but that's beside the point. It's trying to contrast how perfectly neat and tidy this corporate world is with how free and loose the worldof the rest of the film is, but the entire film is actually neat and tidy--the spontaneity and freedom are artificial. I don't buy it.    But thanks to the performances, damn, RENT sure does have a fire in its britches.    In a way, it is simultaneously justified and questionable to call this film fakey, as it is just Jonathon Larson's feelings on the subject rendered in musical form. It really has an energy to it, no denying that. It really challenges you to drop your hangups and relax and enjoy the ride.    I'm not a RENT-head, nor do I hate it. I don't think it's mediocre, canned, or kitsch. I don't think it's amazing or enlightening. Calling it pretentious isn't exactly fair, though there is a pretentiousness to it. I do, however, feel confident in saying both that it has flaws and has something to it.    So, how you feel about RENT will always come down to how deeply you connect to the characters and how much you're feeling the music. Is it an electrifying, heartbreaking celebration of life and love, or is it a mockery? Both cases could be made. My bottom line opinion: RENT is successful in spite of itself. The actors work harder than they should have to to sell a story that's working against them, confined by excessively stiff character molds--and they are so good, they pull it off. What's strong is incredibly strong. But to pretend its flaws didn't exist would be, for me, an intellectual suicide.
0061122416|5.0|This is a beautiful story about a young lad from Spain embarking on the journey of life. After completing his formal education, he chooses to become a shepherd in order to help see more of the world. He learns the ways of shepherds and sheep for several years then has a dream about treasure near the pyramids in Egypt. He sells his sheep and travels to Africa where, upon arrival, all his money is stolen by a thief. Back to nothing, he doesn't lose heart but is industrious and trades cleaning services at a crystal shop for lunch. The shop owner offers him a job and he helps grow the business over the next year.<br /><br />At the end of the year, he has enough money to return to his home and purchase twice as many sheep if he so desired. This however, is not his calling or \\"Personal Legend\\" as the book describes it. He instead hooks up with a caravan traveling to Egypt. On the journey, the caravan stops at a town in an oasis. While there, the boy sees an omen warning the town of an attack.<br /><br />An alchemist subsequently approaches the boy and plays teacher and sage to the boy in his quest to find the treasure. The alchemist helps him see beyond the physical desires of man and go much deeper to the elemental core of man's true desire. He helps him see that sometimes choices involve taking a chance. Though one's current position in life may be comfortable and relatively safe, it can fall short of his or her dreams and Personal Legend.<br /><br />The boy eventually arrives at the pyramids where he begins digging and is promptly robbed in the process. The evil doers ask him why he's digging and he tells them he had a dream that treasure was buried there. One of them says he also had a dream that treasure was buried under a tree at an abandoned church in Spain but that traveling across the desert would be too long and foolish to follow such a lark. The boy recognizes the church's description and returns to ultimately claim the treasure. His great gain was not in finding the treasure but in developing character and experience through the journey he embarked upon.<br /><br />Religious elements from the major world religions are woven throughout the story. The boy had training in Christian studies so this is his base but he then works with and interacts with many Muslims so learns about their faith. Also ever present are the philosophies and teachings of Buddhism which seems to be the predominant current running through the book.<br /><br />Even setting aside the religious elements, the story is a great lesson in seeking out goals and dreams and not settling for the status quo.n developing character and experience through the journey he embarked upon.

B000Z6MIQS|5.0|ultimately i give this album a 4.5 out of 5. after reading the reviews and seeing how some were bad, i decided that i have to go to this bands defense because this record seriously isn't that bad. sure they changed and there are some beats in it, its not a bad thing. it kind of gos with how the songs are. and its not like the beats are throughout the entire songs, they are just brought in here and there. and for those saying that they didn't write their own songs, well guess what? they did, they aren't a band that would all of a sudden not write any songs. pierre's voice is so much more better in this album and we get to here sebastien's voice too more in this album and his voice is also a very good voice that is unde      . and of course david's is always the same...good. the lyrics are so much more grown up and deals with personal situations such as \\"love is a lie\\" and \\"save you\\".     sure this album is a HUGE step from still not getting any...(my fav album by them), but they still maintained who they are. which is something every band should maintain...their true selves. you can tell that they are growing up musically, look at their first album; no pads, no helmets...just balls, you can tell they were all young there. sebastien was just 18/19 years old at that time and the others were under 24 i believe. here you can see that they took the risk and i believe it was a great job and i cant wait to see a show of theirs with these songs performed live.    heres and overview of the songs:    when im gone: 4/5...first single, very good, the video isnt great, but its still a great song    take my hand: 5/5 possibly my favorite song on the record, it upbeat, fun, and the guys sang awesomely in this song    the end: 4/5 another great song, it starts offf kind of cryptic and the chorus is great    love is a lie: 3.5 this song is ok..i think its supposed to be the 2nd single off the record..i gues thats ok...but not something that great    save you: 5/5 another one of my favs. awesome lyrics and the way it flows is just awesome    generation: 4/5 they took a risk in this song with the beats and stuff, but i think its a great anthem song for the teens and a fun song    time to say goodbye: 5/5 this is true SP.  a great song and the way it is live is just something amazing. a great song    i can wait forever: 4/5 one of the slower songs on the album...its a ballad and a touching song if i say so myself    holding on: 5/5 another one of my favs. i love how this song goes and the lyrics are great, and this is something they never did before and its a really great song    no love: 3.9/5 its an ok song...not one of their best in my opinion...but its a good song nonetheless and the lyrics are really good.    what if: 5/5 this song is awesome. the strings in the beginning just chill your bones. i love this song and they did a great job on this song    running out of time: 4/5 a great song and its a fun song to sing along to    so basically this album is really good and if you're a first timer for simple plan, i suggest to listen to their first two albums and then this. for the ones who are already fans, get the cd because im sure it wont let you down =)

B000VZGK3K|3.0|This film is an odd lot. There are a few good points but I was disappointed that a director with as much talent as Martin Scorsese would produce such a poor film. I can't really understand why the Hollywood academy found this to be a good film other than much of the film is about film-making, and thus of special interest to them.     The script is primarily superficial with only a few good moments. Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn, Alec Balwin as the President of Pan-American Airlines, and Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner all have great lines and perform well. It is Leonard DiCaprio who offers the weakest performance in the film. He just is unable to convince the viewer that he is Howard Hughes. From the earliest scenes he appears to be a spoiled boy rather than an eccentric young man. He sounds childish when he raises his voice. As the character of Howard Hughes ages in the film, DiCaprio remains adolescent in looks and manner. Many other actors could have made the film work but DiCaprio was a total disappointment. It is Cate Blanchett's performance as Katherine Hepburn that saves the film. The scene where she takes Howard home to her eccentric New England family is superb and even DiCaprio performs well in this scene. Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow was a waste of Stefani's talent. However the real crime was the cameo from Jude Law as Errol Flynn. The cameo lines were terrible, the acting silly and superficial, the whole thing stunk. Law should have run in the opposite direction when offered this insipid, worthless cameo with no meaning or value added. The male actors who play the accountants, engineers, technicians, and pilots that supported Howard Hughes' wild projects were all excellent. DiCaprio seemed misplaced and miscast surrounded by credible adult male actors. Alan Alda as a corrupt Senator had the absolute worst lines in the film. He was totally unrealistic and foolish and must have received some big bucks to make such a fool of himself in this film. The senate hearing scene may be the worst scene in film-making history and should be used in film school as an example of everything going wrong at once: bad mindless unrealistic script combined with terrible acting.     Scenes meant to convey the glitz and glamour of Hollywood were pitiful and stereotypical. Big party scenes were terrible conglomerations of stereotypes of wild parties for the rich and famous. The rich and famous, even in the 1930s would run away from these silly scenes complete with showgirls swinging over cocktail tables messing up the hair of starlets. These scenes were too much and too silly. To make the scene even more awful, there is a scene where Howard Hughes seduces a brainless cigarette girl in the middle of a nightclub by playing with her genitals under her cigarette selection box. DiCaprio does a terrible job here but the script is so silly that only a master like George Clooney could have pulled off such a terrible meaningless scene.    Why did I give it a 3? Cate Blanchett, Alec Baldwin, and the Hell's Angels footage. The rest was just a mixed bag of silly wasted film.
B000001GEM|5.0|Karajan produced one of the great documents in the postwar era when he recorded the German Requiem in the rubble of 1947 Vienna. That radiant spiritual account, with the incomparable Hans Hotter and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as soloists, should be the starting point for anyone exploring Brahms's greatest choral work. Karajan continued to feel an affinity for it and produced no less than three later versions in stereo, of which this digital account, also from Vienna, is the last -- in his end was his beginning.<br /><br />It is solemn, at times staid, and full of power. If you identify late Karajan with glossy surfaces and glib interpretations (an ovr-generalization that made the great Carlos Kleiber, among others, bristle), never fear. Everything here is profound and touching. The recording is exceptionally fine -- the best of all his versions -- and Jose Van Dam is particularly strong in the baritone part, sounding deeply involved and dramatic. Barbara Hendricks produces an easy, honeyedlyricism in the Traurigkeit movement. I had overlooked this 1985 recording in my enthusiasm for the 1947 original, but it's touched by greatness in its own right.
1570627215|5.0|I have read this book no less than five times over the years. How one could not give this book 5 stars is beyond me. I have read numerous books relating to Buddhism and Hesse' \\"Siddhartha\\" although a fiction is probably the best book ever written on the subject. So simplistic yet so profound in its message. The essence of Buddhism can be found within these pages. I almost feel bad  for the reviewers who gave this book 1-2 stars because they truly missed the point of this incredible book. Anyone that knows even the basics about Buddhism is already aware that the concept of Buddhism is very simplistic (which can be found in Siddhartha) it is the practice of Buddhism that takes dedication, discipline, and determination which is better explained in other books.  A true classic which will stand the test of time.
B000000W5L|3.0|Ahh the Stones........instrumentally probably one of the most average bands to make it big in the history of rock n roll, but they have always had that certain something that have kept them at the top much longer than most of their peers from the same era.  In 2007 the Stones can still fill football stadiums more than 40 years after their formation.  I don't have a lot of Stones on CD, but I have picked up a few of their albums over the years.  Many Stones fans consider \\"Exile\\" to be one of the band's all time great albums.  I like it, but probably not as much as a lot of people do.  The production is muddy and lackluster even by 1972 standards.  There is some good material to be found here, but like many double studio albums (the CD is a single) there is a lot of filler here too.  The album really did not produce any huge hits for the Stones.  \\"Tumbling Dice\\" and Keith Richard's led \\"Happy\\" were the two tracks to receive the most airplay with \\"All Down The Line\\" getting a bit on AOR radio as well..  The rest of the album is a mix of R & B, basic rock, blues and country.  It is the Rolling Stones at their most basic, and they neither excel nor bomb on the majority of this album.
032147404X|4.0|This book is very helpful for the beginning slr photographer, and even those semi-pros that spend more brain capacity being creative rather than technical. The book is easy to read and provides many simple, practical tips and advice. Scott manages to answer \\"why\\" without too many details. Yes, his humor can be pretty cheesy -- but he reminds me of just a regular good-natured guy. Other than the few introductory pages where the jokes are most annoying, this book is 95% good, solid info. Well worth the low price.

B000A6T1JU|5.0|The Warriors was a film about street gangs in New York City in the late 70's / early 80's.  It certainly doesn't represent what gang life is like today.  In fact, I don't think that this would properly represent what gang life was like then either.  But, this is a good movie.  The characters are not really believable as gang members though.  This story follows a group of nine gang members from the Warrior street gang located near Coney Island in New York.  A City Wide meeting has been called and each gang must send nine members of their respective gangs to this meeting.  Chaos breaks out during the meeting and the warriors are blamed for the problem.  Now the gang has to make it back to Coney Island alive while being hunted down by thousands of rival gang members across the city.  As corny as some of the scenes are, this movie is still a classic.

0525950079|1.0|I was so looking forward to this book remembering how much I enjoyed Pillars of the Earth. I even bought it in hard cover (and I usually use the library). I felt it was written in a very slapdash manner and was very predictable. Some of the characters were interesting and I did finish the book but I felt that I really wasted my time.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|Stargate: Atlantis was my first brush with the Stargate franchise - aside from having caught the dismal original movie on air - and I honestly didn't expect much. Being a huge science fiction fan, I expected to have seen most of it done better before. Well, it's all been done before, but never quite like this. The series takes all the clichés and stock plots, and put its own spin on it entirely. It has charm. It knows its own weaknesses and doesn't hesitate to throw a few wry comments into the cam. The characters are marvellously flawed and realistic most of the time, and delightfully witty to boot. The plots are hackneyed and old, but executed to near-perfection, and strung along into a coherent arc.  It's not the most original thing in the world, but it's fresh. If you're not a die-hard SF fan, you most likely won't be converted, but if you're new to the genré and like what you see, this ought to be your first stop, and if you're already fed to bursting and starting to get sick of Star Trek and Doctor Who, then this might just remind you why you loved them in the first place.

I wish to thank Mr. Bossidy and Mr. Charan for their compelling insights, supported by relevant examples.<br /><br />There is no fat in this book. When you consider the backround of the authors, and the valuable information a reader walks away with, this book is a must read for any person seeking to win in business or life.

I have begun reading it myself, and you can't find a better organized, better written, more concise book on survival out there than this one. It shared everything from edible plants, to how to carry an injured person, to how create a steamer for your food out of a hollow branch. I would say to take the plunge and buy it, you'll be pleased and very much so educated in any survival situation.

It works!<br /><br />A great read. Something for everyone. I recommend it strongly.
B000002KET|5.0|I recently bought this album, only expecting a little more then what Never Say Die had to offer, but listening to some of these tracks blew me away.    Basic reviews on songs I particularly enjoyed.  Sabbath Bloody Sabbath-Great song. I liked the acoustic jams in between the main riff, as well as the heavy riff towards the end.  A National Acrobat-This song has a good guitar solo, and the main riff with the two separate guitar recordings Iommi made sounds really cool.  Fluff-This might sound strange coming out of a sabbath fans mouth (listen to the song and you'll know why) but this song is beautiful.  Sabbra Cadabra-This was a nice song which in some ways reminded me of old 50's rock tunes, mainly because of the chord progression and the lyrics.  Looking for today-A good fast paced song that makes you want to get up and dance.  Spiral Architect-This song is epic,almost like something out of a movie, really good song.    The other songs were OK but they did not stick out to me as GREAT.     Over all this is a great album, but don't expect another Paranoid album. I think that this album is sometimes underrated but it deserves respect as one of Sabbaths best albums. This album defiantly brought a lot of experimental elements into it (Rick Wakeman from Yes on keyboards was cool) but don't let that deter you from buying this. It is a must have album and all Sabbath fans cant live without it.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I saw the Beetles at Olympia Arena in Detroit.    I got my draft notice in 1966 while in basic training.  I was in Detroit during the Riots.  I remember funeral detail.  I remember what I was doing when I learned that Dr. King was killed.    This film is amazing.    It's not just the music or coriography.    The film captures my generation.  This is what it was like to be a flower child.  This is the essence of the 60's.

B000WCDI64|5.0|First of all, Amy is NOT wasted in this concert! Obviously, many of you don't know about her or her style! If you watch this DVD, she is totally in control. In fact, in some cuts, she's seen telling the band what to do next or to keep going....Her style is unusual and her accent is from a certain part of London which isn't very discernible for americans....and would seem like she wasn't all there.I love her lazy, jazzy, retro way around a me;ody. This DVD is great! Besides the concert, there is a nice documentary on her story.....The sound quality is very good...esp. on DTS....enjoy!
B000005RFQ|5.0|This is a one shot wonder for this band, strayed away from the Ozzy & Dio sound, but came up with a gem with Ian Gillian as the front man.  The riffs and style is what Black Sabbath is all about, heavy, heart punding, head banging msuic.  The album is a sleeper, but a great value and a collectors item if you are a Sabbath Fan!

B000ZLFALI|5.0|For a generation, the only Beatles-themed musical was the abysmal \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", and, truthfully, I feared director Julie Taymor's \\"Across the Universe\\" wouldn't be much better...but happily, I was wrong. This is a remarkable, multi-layered rock tribute of an era that not only homages the music of the Fab Four, but may just be the finest musical in years!<br /><br />Closer in spirit to Milos Forman's \\"Hair\\" and Ken Russell's 70's extravaganzas, the story of Jude, a lad from Liverpool (Jim Sturgess), his American friend, Max, a footloose anarchist Ivy Leaguer (Joe Anderson), and Max's sister, Lucy, a pampered rich girl (Evan Rachel Wood), echoes Forman's exuberance in recapturing the spirit of revelation, experimentation, and disillusionment that was the heart of the 1960s. The trio winds up in a Bohemian, free-spirited Manhattan, bonding with Joplin-esque singer, Sadie (Dana Fuchs), Hendrix-inspired rocker, JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy), and sensitive lesbian, Prudence (T.V. Carpio). This opening third of the movie is so exuberant and heartfelt that you may catch yourself singing along to Beatles' anthems like \\"A Little Help from My Friends\\" and \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\".<br /><br />The film nearly loses itself in Russell-like visual overkill as it slides into the psychedelic drug culture, personified by acid guru Dr. Robert (Bono), and counter-culture showman, Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard), but Vietnam, race riots, and the anti-war movement restores a balance to the story, with a moving rooftop finale reminiscent of the climax of the Beatles' final film, \\"Let It Be\\".<br /><br />After the grim, off-kilter musical, \\"Chicago\\", it is refreshing to see a film combine music and story in a celebration of life and love. The cast sings Lennon/McCartney and Harrison superbly, the choreography of the big production numbers is inventive and often amusing, and, best of all, there is a youthful optimism and energy in every aspect of the production that is infectious.<br /><br />\\"Across the Universe\\" proves movie musicals aren't dead, they only need the right inspiration...This is a film you can cherish!erse\\" proves movie musicals aren't dead, they only need the right inspiration...This is a film you can cherish!
1592289444|2.0|Buyer beware!     This book is purportedly a \\"true account\\" of a Polish army officer who escapes from the Nazis at the beginning of WWII only to be captured, tortured and deported to Siberia by the Russians.  Most of the book deals with his escape (along with several other captives) from the camp and wondering through Siberia, across the Gobi desert, over the Himalayas to India.    The fact is that the story is fictional.  There is no evidence for its truthfulness, on the contrary.  Besides the account of Rawics' eventual admission to the fact that he made it up, there are no military records from Indian or British military archives that document the \\"arrival\\" of Rawicz and his fellow escapees (see Wikipedia for a list of sources).  Moreover, there are enough clues throughout the book that will make you raise your eyebrows with respect to the  book's authenticity.  Which is a pity since the book is a good read and is hard to put down once a person gets into it.  It that more unfortunate as there are many people who enjoy reading biographical accounts to help them shape their view of events and of the world.  Since this is a made up story, it is also misleading in many ways, although there are things that Rawicz got right as the story is based in a real-life context.     It is entertaining and certainly a captivating read at times.  In some ways it's an inspiring story of survival and endurance.  But due to the misleading information about its fictional basis I have a hard time recommending it.

B000YAFJYS|5.0|This weekend I went to see the Oscar nominated film Persepolis. The film is based on the graphic novel of the same name by Iranian author Marjane Satrapi. Marjane also writes the screenplay as well as directs the animated film with the help of Vincent Paronnaud. The film/graphic novel is autobiographical on Marjane's life during and after the reign of the Shah. Legendary Gallic actress Catherine Deneuve and her daughter Chiara Mastroianni ironically assumes the mother and daughter roles in the film. For people who don't like subtitles, this film isn't for you. The entire film is in French with English subtitles.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find myself engrossed by the story of Marjane Satrapi than by the animation. Her life in and outside of Iran was anything but boring. The film is particularly spot on when it came to describing life in Iran during the early '80s when the Shah was in power. Life in Iran became even more unbearable when the overzealous religious whackjobs got into power after the fall of the Shah. I believe it was Marjane who mentions that the only reason the religious fundamentalists got into power was because most of the country was illiterate and uneducated, and nationalism and religion was the only things that everyone knew. Voting for religious fundamentalists proved to be the country's own undoing.<br /><br />The film isn't all that dark depressing. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments through out the film where Marjane could laugh at herself like her love life. Another hilarious moment is after Marjane goes through a bought of depression after returning to Iran, she decides to pick herself up and go back to school, singing to the tune of \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" by Survivor. Let me just say that Chiara  Mastroianni can't sing a single note to save her life but her lack of singing ability makes that particular moment in the film all the more earnest and endearing to me as well as hilarious. The music in the film is fantastic. It is a mix of French pop/techno and Middle Eastern music.<br /><br />There were many times during the film when I was so engrossed with the story that I forgot that the film was animated. Persepolis felt more like a biopic than an animated film. It is rare to find an animated film where the story sucks the viewer in until the the ending credits begins to roll. This film is definitely worth viewing for anyone who has the opportunity to do so.ch pop/techno and Middle Eastern music.

0143038419|4.0|Frankly, it took me a few chapters to really get into this novel. It was hard at first to get past the author's whining about her life and circumstances. Being a happily married woman, I couldn't help but feel more sympathetic toward the husband she was leaving. But after I got past that, I reveled in her experiences in Italy, India and Indonesia. I didn't think life could get any better than living in Italy for a few months, but then I got sucked into her experiences at the Indian ashram, and I loved the picture she painted about her time in  Indonesia too. While some readers may not be able to relate to the author's personal life, those who enjoy traveling and reading travel memoirs will no doubt appreciate this novel.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Miles, Corea, Hancock, Zawinul, Shorter, McLaughlin, Holland, Williams.  This is one of the greatest fusion line ups of all time. With this album Miles Davis turned jazz on to a brilliant road of modern sound and talent. SHHH/Peaceful starts out the album with beautiful melodies and the classic dissonant Davis stabs that were really brought out on this and Bitch's Brew. For having three keys going on at basically the same time, Corea, Hancock, and Zawinul work amazingly well and create pure magic and harmony. This album jumpstarted an entire way of composing, thinking, and playing jazz that ultimately shaped music today in more ways than we will ever know. Miles Davis will remain as being one of the most creative and cutting edge jazz virtuosos of all time.
B000ZK4T98|5.0|When I heard Willis was going to be back in another installment of the Die Hard Saga, I was immediately skeptical.  Why?  Well, \\"Die Hard 2: Die Harder\\" tells me that this series isn't exactly flawless, considering how poor of a story that was.  Then there's the fact this was going to be rated PG-13.  That means McClane was going to have to watch his language.  The other part that was working against this for me was that McClane was going to be facing off against internet terrorists, or at least that's how it was described.  My friends and I came up with all kinds of joke scenarios that involved McClane yelling at people on forums and making twelve year olds cry about it, because they were the terrorists of the internet!  Internet Terrorists just don't seem like something that might be in McClane's jurisdiction or a problem he could easily solve, it's just not his character archetype.  Imagine my surprise when this movie more than delivered the action packed follow up that it required!<br /><br />If you read the above elements, you really can't see how it will all fit together, but the writers of this film really pulled it together really well.  It's an incredibly engaging story-line that does leave you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what will happen next.  And trust me, these internet terrorists have more than enough mercenary henchmen to keep McClane occupied!  Basically because the U.S. is mostly connected to the internet, someone with special knowledge knows how to essentially hold the country hostage by taking away all the elements we depend on, like electricity, finances, etc.  It suddenly falls to McClane to take out this guy's entire organization so this country can get back on its feet.<br /><br />Surprisingly I didn't find Justin Long's character, Matt Farrell, to be nearly as annoying as I thought it might.  I didn't particularly like his performance in \\"Accepted,\\" and the last thing I remember liking him in was \\"Galaxy Quest\\" and he wasn't in a major role for that film.  I think he's a bit better as a side actor instead of being a star of a film.  Olyphant (Thomas Gabriel) presented himself as a very convincing bad guy.  I think in his character they tried to create a similar atmosphere to Hans Gruber from the original film.  Gabriel was a very hands off bad guy that let a lot of his henchmen do the work, Gruber did this a lot in the first film as well.  Whereas his brother Simon Gruber was very hands on and showed he wasn't afraid to do a lot of work on his own as well.  I will say that, despite his lack of involvement, Gabriel was a pretty good mastermind bad guy.  I wouldn't say I was blown away by Olyphant's performance in this, especially after I've seen Hitman, which he was much better in, but I thought he did the job fairly well.<br /><br />A surprising addition to the film was the introduction of McClane's daughter, Lucy.  In some respects I think her role was slightly unnecessary, but it wouldn't have warranted the block buster ending this film closed with.  It sort of seemed written in for the purpose of having a girl to save in the film, similar to the first one again.  So it seemed almost too much like they were trying to reclaim the magic of the very first Die Hard, which really isn't a realistic move because it's just not going to happen.  Regardless, overall these minor points are overshadowed by the greater story at hand, because it is actually very well thought out.<br /><br />So in comparison to the other three films, where does this stack up?  It's not better than the first, the first is seriously a classic in the action genre and it always will be.  It's definitely better than the second, which at this point might as well be deleted from the saga to bring it back down to a trilogy.  The part that I'm at a loss for is if this is better than the third.  \\"With a Vengeance\\" had a spectacular cast that worked magically.  Jeremy Irons probably gave one of his best performances in this movie,because it was very different to see him playing a major bad guy and he definitely played a better bad guy than Olyphant.  Let's not forget the interaction between Willis and Jackson was just perfect and this film didn't really get that same effect between Willis and Long.  So in the end, I think I still like \\"With a Vengeance\\" more, but this one is definitely a quality film.<br /><br />Now for this particular product as being the unrated version, THIS is the Die Hard I was expecting to see released in theatres.  For whatever reason they actually deleted out all the swears to give it a wider audience, while this may seem like a great money maker move, it's just very out of character for McClane to look like he's watching his language at every turn.  For those of us who wanted to see a more in character McClane you definitely need to buy the Unrated version, the script is fully unedited and all the harsh language is put back into the film.  In retrospect I think this was a pretty smart move.  Cut out the swears for the IN theater release then have them put back in for the DVD release.  I mean realistically the swearing doesn't really make the film; it just seems odd not to have it.  If you know they're doing this only for the theatrical release it doesn't detract from the film in the least and when you get it on DVD you get to see more what you were expecting to see and give you something newer to watch.  I thought this was actually a pretty good idea, definitely better than releasing the theatrical version and then months later releasing the unrated version.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this steel case edition is being advertised with the movie ticket, it's long since expired.  The movie ticket is for Hitman, which isn't even in theaters at this point.  I was given the steel version as a gift, and I was going to be buying the movie anyway and I can't say I'm disappointed with this special collector's edition.<br /><br />Finally, this movie has what all Die Hard fans wanted to see!  We may not have gotten it in Die Hard 2, but we certainly got it here.  Now that they have expanded this to a four part series, I'm not sure if I think they should stop here.  Part of me is saying don't ruin a good thing and leave the series as it is.  Another part of me wants more action packed movies with McClane's character.  At the risk of putting out a poor film, I don't think they should resurrect this series anymore and just leave it as is.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had vaguely heard of this show when it was actually running,but never watched it. Then the movie came out and the critics really raved over it, so I thought I'd check it out. It was excellent. So I rented the DVD's with the actual episodes. Man, what great stories, interesting characters, funny, action, even alittle emotional at times, sexy, special effects, this show had it all. The only way I can explain it is, its like having an old friend come to stay with you. I've never reacted to a TV show like that before. Wierd, in a way. But great. I have one more DVD to watch, and when the last episode has run, I will genuinely miss it.   I'm am grateful for the few episodes that were made, and can only wish that some kind of groundswell movement to make more will kick in (Re: The original Star Trek after it was cancelled).   Thank you Firefly. Thank you Serenity.

It's definitely better than the second, which at this point might as well be deleted from the saga to bring it back down to a trilogy.  The part that I'm at a loss for is if this is better than the third.  \\"With a Vengeance\\" had a spectacular cast that worked magically.  Jeremy Irons probably gave one of his best performances in this movie,because it was very different to see him playing a major bad guy and he definitely played a better bad guy than Olyphant.  Let's not forget the interaction between Willis and Jackson was just perfect and this film didn't really get that same effect between Willis and Long.  So in the end, I think I still like \\"With a Vengeance\\" more, but this one is definitely a quality film.<br /><br />Now for this particular product as being the unrated version, THIS is the Die Hard I was expecting to see released in theatres.  For whatever reason they actually deleted out all the swears to give it a wider audience, while this may seem like a great money maker move, it's just very out of character for McClane to look like he's watching his language at every turn.  For those of us who wanted to see a more in character McClane you definitely need to buy the Unrated version, the script is fully unedited and all the harsh language is put back into the film.  In retrospect I think this was a pretty smart move.  Cut out the swears for the IN theater release then have them put back in for the DVD release.  I mean realistically the swearing doesn't really make the film; it just seems odd not to have it.  If you know they're doing this only for the theatrical release it doesn't detract from the film in the least and when you get it on DVD you get to see more what you were expecting to see and give you something newer to watch.  I thought this was actually a pretty good idea, definitely better than releasing the theatrical version and then months later releasing the unrated version.<br /><br />Finally, this movie has what all Die Hard fans wanted to see!  We may not have gotten it in Die Hard 2, but we certainly got it here.  Now that they have expanded this to a four part series, I'm not sure if I think they should stop here.  Part of me is saying don't ruin a good thing and leave the series as it is.  Another part of me wants more action packed movies with McClane's character.  At the risk of putting out a poor film, I don't think they should resurrect this series anymore and just leave it as is.  It's always better to end it on a high note.o see him playing a major bad guy and he definitely played a better bad guy than Olyphant.

B0011NVC9I|2.0|I wasn't that impressed by the special effects and you can clearly see that all this movie was filmed in a studio. Sometimes the landscape look ridiculous, with some horrible flashy orange sunset:it looks so artificial ! Apart from the monster Grendel (who was greatly animated I have to say), the rest fall apart as the movie goes on...Poor acting from Angelina Jolie as well, just here for the decoration. And Ray Winstone is clearly not as gifted as Gerald Butler.  They tried to do something like 300, with the moral of courage and honor but it sounds...empty! Honeyed, without consistance, like a Ron Howard movie. This incredibly beautiful story deserves much better than that..
0316113506|5.0|Great book for all ages.  I bought it because I work with children with learning challenges, however as I read it I realized that it applies to everyone.  The book pulls together much research about learning, anxiety, depression, ADHD, aging, etc. and the effects of exercise on each.

This is one of the few post war costume epics that doesn't come across as silly.  Both the subject and the film are the stuff of myth.<br /><br />The sets and scenery are astonishing.  Sam Bronston's production company spared no expense scouting locations to recreate castles in Spain.  Entire industries sprang up whole to create the costumes, saddles, weaponry, armor and other items required for the movie.  The sword making industry in Toledo was reinvigorated when the word went out the company didn't want any cheap flimsy props for their epic picture.  The Spanish army, and their horses, were hired to portray the thousands of soldiers required in the battle sequences. Something like this will probably never be duplicated again in the real world, and CGI can't reproduce what you see on the screen in \\"El Cid.\\"<br /><br />Charlton Heston, with a towering physical presence and Shakespearean training, was Hollywood's go-to-guy for epic heroes (as Ben Hur in [[ASIN:B0009UZG1O Ben-Hur (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)]], or as Moses in [[ASIN:B000CNESNA The Ten Commandments (50th Anniversary Collection)]]).  He does not disappoint as \\"El Cid.\\"  Heston does an outstanding job bringing to life \\"one who lived and died the purest knight of all.\\"  El Cid is a man who, with the admiration and respect of both Christians and Moors, defeats an invasion force and units Spain under one king.  Sophia Loren, at the height of her beauty, makes an incomparable wife to the legendary hero. The supporting cast are also excellent.<br /><br />The restored version of this movie looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous.  This is worth seeing on the largest screen with the best surround sound you can manage.  \\"El Cid\\" is one of the last movies with a full length score and, although it has been chopped up a bit to allow for a few minutes of sound affects (war drums, clanging swords, etc.) it is a reminder about how much music can lend to a film. For example, one character's death occurs off screen in shadow; we know he is dead because the music informs us.<br /><br />This two disc package breaks up the film during the intermission section.

ISBN: 0-7679-0385-4  It is the home of the largest living thing on earth, the Great Barrier Reef, and of the largest monolith, Ayers Rock (or Uluru to use its now-official, more respectful Aboriginal name). It has more things that will kill you than anywhere else. Of the world's ten most poisonous snakes, all are Australian. Five of its creatures--the funnel web spider, box jellyfish, blue-ringed octopus, paralysis tick, and stonefish--are the most lethal of their type in the world. This is a country where even the fluffiest of caterpillars can lay you out with a toxic nip, where seashells will not just sting you but actually sometimes go for you. Pick up an innocuous cone shell from a Queensland beach, as innocent tourists are all too wont to do, and you will discover that the little fellow inside is not just astoundingly swift and testy but exceedingly venomous. If you are not stung or pronged to death in some unexpected manner, you may be fatally chomped by sharks or crocodiles, or carried helplessly out to sea by irresistible currents, or left to stagger to an unhappy death in the baking outback. It's a tough place.    Oh yes, I read it, also the German version Frühstück mit Kängurus, both several times.

B000WTLDPU|5.0|This is a lovely film with great visuals and quality acting. Gaiman's story unfolds many of the archetypal elements that have been captivating children and adults for centuries. Our fascination with the stars, magic kingdoms, evil witches is generously indulged in this story about a young man's quest for his adulthood and love.<br /><br />The film is peppered with funny moments and hints and one cannot escape the suspicion that the crew had a good time filming. Casting did a great job as well, Pfeiffer's role as the evil witch Lamia in particular is an acting tour de force. A thoroughly enjoyable film.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have purchased 3 copies of this double disk.  Love, Love LOve the Chili Peppers.  Any difficult day can be made better by sliding in a RHCP disk and this one is amazing. Every ordinary day becomes extraordinary with the RHCP.  They get me through the rough times and elevate the good times.  Makes me smile.     Since I own all that is RHCP and am of similar age, I can tell you that this is different from early stuff... just a little.  But life is a voyage and who wants to travel in circles revisiting the same ol'same ol'.
B000V86OKG|5.0|This show has got me hooked big time.  Cant wait for season 3 to come..  This show is so far above the norm for tv drama its not fair to call it that. I am so impressed with the acting I have to say it is comparible to The Sopranos..  REALLY..   If you haven't seen it yet.. do yourself a favor and get season one and then two and sit back and be prepared to enjoy!!
B000KX0IOA|5.0|If one could give a film 6 stars, \\"Gandhi\\" would be deserving.  Only David Lean could have matched the sweeping spectacle of British India as treated by Attenborough.  If you've never seen this movie, now is certainly the time.
B0009QZ4CO|3.0|3 1/2<br /><br />With shades of epic-ness, this lyrically heavy-handed, pretentiously sung work often feels a little more sluggish then it ought. There remains enough melodic assertion however, (in better moments reminiscent of the compositional keyboardist complexities found in Gentle Giant, but usually ending up sounding more like the rustic rust of Jethro Tull) to elevate a few of these older and aggressive progressive rock slugouts into a memorable light.
B000UXKYWQ|4.0|This movie had the misfortune of being released shortly after Dr. Zhivago, and suffered from poor PR and the overwhelming public love affair with Julie Christie. In fact, this is a far better story than Dr. Zhivago, mostly because it is arguably the true story of the murder suicide of crown prince Rudolf of Austria and his mistress, the baroness Maria Vetsera. Omar Sharif is his usual suave self as the crown prince, although a little unconvincing, but the underated and beautiful Catherine Deneuve produces a sympathetic performance as his mistress. the music (particularly the use of the ballet 'spartacus') is stunningly effective.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Bought this DVD from Tower Records. Strange, I was never a country fan (I live in Asia and country music practically don't exist in this part of the world) but I always knew who Shania is. First heard Any Man of Mine from a compilation CD which features other Grammy Nominees from 1995. Thought that song was fun and catchy. And credit to MTV too. There was a point where That Don't Impress Me Much and You're Still the One are always on TV. Not sure what made me bought this but I don't regret it at all. I do not know 80% of the songs, yet I am enthralled by her performance. Fantastic...I find most artists nowadays hardly give more than 1 and half hour of concert time but Shania gave more than that and with less breaks in between. She just lets her music speaks for themselves! Gotta love her for that. Really wish I was there.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|The series 3 was good, but it is a shame they took the program off the air. It was a good series for a female teen to view, other than the typical shows that don't put much effort into women being detectives and good ones at that.
B0010ZR160|5.0|After watching so many lousy, brainless films this year, I can only thank you, Ben Affleck, for making such a terrific, intelligent film for adults.  I agree with the other reviewers - you need to stay behind the camera (and I intend that as a compliment)!  Casey Affleck was a terrific surprise in this film and, in the end, carried this film along and was never upstaged by some other heavy-hitters in this great ensemble cast.  I loved that the portrayals - especially of Patrick and Angie - were not caricatures.  Instead, the actors (and writers, and costumers, and makeup artists, etc.) gave us characters who could easily be people you know and pass on the street every day.   This movie proves that you can have a GREAT film without making things blow up, gratuitously presenting the lead actresses in skimpy lingerie, or doing million-dollar car chases. This is just a plain old great story, brilliantly acted and presented.  Now THAT'S what I want in a movie.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|I'm a huge Beatles fan and gave this movie a try. It was horrible. Simply put: Bad acting, Bad Beatles covers, and especially BAD PLOT!!<br /><br />They basically stole the plot from an NBC made for TV movie called \\"The 60s\\" (or something like that) from 1998. It really is, more or less, the exact same plot, but dare I say it? The NBC movie is actually a lot better!!<br /><br />On the soundtrack: I love the Beatles music, as they recorded it however. The people who sang the covers are not even really singers, just actors pretending to be singers.<br /><br />And the director is a major hack and a pretensious snob. Special effects subpar, direction horrible, etc...<br /><br />This movie likes to romanticize the 60s, and I can see how it can appeal to 13-14 year old wannabe \\"hippies\\" but anybody over 21 with any self respect should not get caught praising this \\"movie\\" or whatever this piece of **** calls itself.
B000L43QJ2|4.0|This performance of the Paris Opera is very beautiful and elegant. While the lack of emotion by Jose and Agnes does detract some from the performance, their dancing is graceful, soft, and beautiful. With more emotion, I would've given this an extra star. Don't let this keep you from buying this dvd. I changed my review of this performance. In the beginning, I didn't like the camara work. It has really grown on me. The camara really captures the patterns and lighting which contributes to the mood of this performance. The picture quality, sound, lighting, and performance make this a stunningly beautiful presentation.
B000NA28HU|4.0|After reading the scathing reviews put forth here by others, I am more amused than put off by them.    Eragon was a pretty good movie.  It moved well, was well acted, the locations were excellent and the special effects were breathtaking.  Even the casting - with one exception I will note later - was outstanding.    But, for those of you lost in the books and their detail, I have but one bit of advice; lighten up!  A motion picture is not a book and need not follow the contents of a book exactly.  Often, three pages of description and dialog can be recreated in a trice onscreen.  And, believe it or not, the series begun here might not be a reiteration of the first book.  It is an introduction to the entire series; setting the scene, introducing the characters and delivering delicious hints to the relationships that will develop.  Now we know the players and cannot wait to see what they do  next.  Even Saphira's sexy voice, paired with her dragon's demeanor, made for an exquisite paradox.      The mix of proven character actors, such as Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich with youngsters such and Speleers and Hedlund works splendidly, with only the Eragon/Arya relationship looking strained; the rosy cheeked lad and the near matron, showing every minute of the 12 or so years between them.    Personally, I would look to the sequel as an expansion on what I have been given; some knowledge and a curiosity built by the hints already presented.  If they are actually able to produce such a film, I will be in line early to buy tickets.
B000W4KT64|5.0|I heard rave reviews, especially about John Travolta, and watched with great anticipation. And by all standards, this is such a hilarious and cheerful musical. Its success owe much to its excellent balance of great dance numbers and everyone has their turn to lead in the spotlight. For the first half, I am captivated by the singing and dancing Tracey, she is so beautiful and so plus size! Then it is her classmates' turn, the vibrant black youths in the detention class, singing even more beautifully and leap so high in the air. When Mrs. Turnblad (John Travolta) showed up with her feminine features, not to mention her adorable and modest demeanor, that's worth zillions of laughs. The scene Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad (Christopher Walken) singing in the backyard can be so romantic. But I love the finale best - the way John Trovolta moves and bends, Queen Lativah sings and the group dancers twirl round and round unbelievably fast.<br /><br />As for the plot - not to discriminate against race, size and look- it may be predictable but the cast is so funny that it's still worth watching again and again. And one big surprise, to someone who can't dance (me), the 2 dance lessons in the bonus features given by the choregraphers are eye-opening. They inspire me with the \\"camel pull\\", \\"chicken\\" moves. And now I admire those dancers greatly, even more than the main characters. All right, maybe Mrs. Turnblad's final dance is still hard to beat!
B0007PAMR4|4.0|I have heard nothing but bad things about this film. Before seeing it I was under the impression that it was universally panned as a supreme failure. So, being somewhat susceptible to the influences of mass opinion, I avoided watching it. This, when David Lynch is my favorite filmmaker.<br /><br />However, I finally decided to watch it with an inner thought of, \\"Well, can it really be THAT bad?\\" So I sat down to watch and from the first moments of Princess Irulan's narration was entranced. Sure, the movie is not perfect. The last third is rushed, and material had to be cut to get a reasonable length. But Lynch does NOT disappoint. The actors are great, the script is well-written, the look of the film is revolutionary, and the emotion of the book is transferred with Lynch's distinct subtlety and insight into human nature.<br /><br />I honestly cannot see why this film gets so many bad reviews. It seems to me, which is typically the case, that most of these reviews are either from people who require a film adaptation to be a word-for-word interpretation of the book, or those who cannot identify with the depth of character and the complex subtext. To each her own.
B0010ZR160|4.0|I like the movie's non-exaggerating, fluid tone. Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan make a convincing couple as detectives for missing people. This is not like \\"without a trace\\". It leads one to think of the possibilities of the fate of the little girl. Who are the good and bad people? And somehow I do not agree with Casey Affleck's point of view. Michelle Monaghan is the more analytical and realistic one.    A movie that makes one think and ponder is worth watching. And Ben Affleck has proven he can write, direct and choose the right cast. Besides, the lake scene is breathtaking.
B000002H97|5.0|Sales don't mean much in terms of measuring an album's quality.  Shania Twain and countless boy-bands have stumbled upon the secret of selling ten million albums. That doesn't mean the music is decent.    But I think there is something to be said for an album that hasn't left Billboard's pop catalog in 17+ years.    According to most Metallica / heavy metal fans, this is not the band's best album.  Some consider it the \\"beginning of the end\\" of the band, but that's a wee bit ridiculous.  While the later albums like Reload and St. Anger haven't duplicated the raw energy (and arguable brilliance) of the band's earlier material, they all have high points (\\"Bleeding Me\\", \\"Fixxxer\\", \\"No Leaf Clover\\", \\"All Within My Hands\\")  that should at least clear them of some of the obnoxious damnation aimed their way.    The \\"black album\\" is the bridge between Metallica's two entirely different eras.  Some of the material here (\\"Holier Than Thou\\", \\"The Struggle Within\\", \\"Through the Never\\") is reminiscent of the band's thrash days.  And some of it foreshadowed the slower, more groove-oriented sounds of the nineties and twenty-first century Metallica (despite some claims, their nineties material sounds more like Zeppelin and Sabbath than anything alternative).  Curiously, it's these slower songs that I think have best stood the test of time.      This album is a living reminder of when Metallica aligned with the sun and took over the world.  Because of this, some claim this record is flawed and too commercial.  Maybe so, but Metallica's dominance began with Ride the Lightning and broke the surface with the release of \\"One\\", and the \\"groove\\" sounds found here were first demonstrated on \\"mainstream\\" songs like \\"Escape\\" and \\"Leper Messiah\\".    Commercial or not, this album is what a Metallica album should be: heavy.  And there is not a better Metallica album in existence to demonstrate James Hetfield's vocal capabilities-- he sounds raw, angry, and somehow right on key.  The whole banddoes.    Buy this.  Old Metallica, new Metallica...  I think time will show that Metallica is Metallica.  And \\"My Friend of Misery\\" alone is worth the price you'll pay for this piece of history.

0321544080|2.0|I agree with Randall Steffens's review... this book has great photos with interesting stories... but that's it.. picture with stories.    This book is supposed to provide \\"Ah ha! moments\\" so we can reproduce his shot, but unfortunately there is not much useful information.     It was pleasant to read the book but sad to say I will be returning this book back and save my money for another SB800.
B000TGJ80I|3.0|I saw this movie a while back, and while it isn't the best movie ever, I do love the mood and theme. Vampires vs. Werewolves. And it's made much better in beautiful High-def. This movie will never win any awards for acting or plotline, but for a modern day take on the classic \\"horror\\" creatures it is entertaining. I got it off Amazon for about $14.99 and it was well worth the purchase, but I probably wouldn't pay more than 20.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Follet returns to midevil England and doesn't miss a beat.  With roots set in pillars, this is a complete and new story.  The characters are compelling andthe plot shortens a thousand page book.  Well done.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|I got the Coldplay 2003 DVD as a birthday present in '04. Coldplay's my favorite band, so you can imagine my excitement. Back in the days, I never thought I could ever be in a real concert of the band, I lived too far away from any place they toured.   Almost four years later, I still think the DVD was the best concert in my life. That is, taking into consideration that I went to see them, against all odds,  in NYC in 2006. It's not that the concert was bad, it was one of the best days in my life. It's that to me, the DVD is so good that I can't get enough of it.   The band plays perfectly, the connection with the crowd is real, the choice of songs is fantastic, the sound is epic, the transitions that go along with songs, including colors, angles and views of the crowd and the band are nothing but exciting and bright.  If there's any DVD I would ever recommend, it's this one. It's the closest you'll come to live the Coldplay experience if you haven't got the chance to live it already.
B0010V4TZU|1.0|I bought this from Amazon and, while eagerly waiting for it to arrive, read numerous rave reviews.  Needless to say, I was excited to finally get and give it a listen.  Total disappointment.  I listened  again; the same.  It's like Paul Simon's Graceland...but without any of the good parts.  And I'm not crazy about Graceland.  Anyhow, don't get sucked into the hype.  This Vampire has no blood.

1591396190|4.0|\\"Blue Ocean\\" is a metaphor of uncontested market space that is reached by reconstructing market boundaries. The authors convincingly show how this impacts profit and growth, and why we should focus analysis on strategic moves as opposed to strategic companies.<br /><br />Central to the theory is the \\"strategy canvas\\", in which you rate a company on a set of industry factors. You than tweak these to find uncontested market space. This demands some creativity, but basically you decide for each factor whether it will be reduced, eliminated, created, or raised.<br /><br />There is a good set of convincing cases to support the point. By seeing how companies invented and exploited blue oceans you get an intuitive feel for  potential in a market.
B00104QSOM|5.0|Some of the reviews here on amazon for this film are not only quite interesting but more so they are quite egotistical sounding. P.T. Anderson's \\"There Will Be Blood\\"(in my personal opinion)is a masterpiece! Now I'm not the most educated reviewer here on amazon so I speak for myself and do not intend to push on you what you should think about this film(or any film for that matter). For me the story that is being told  is always very important, but never as important as the way in wich the storyteller chooses to tell it. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a brilliant example of a director taking a ordinary tale of good old american greed and turning it into an extraordinary tale of how the darkness of the human soul tends to destroy the lighter more intelegent side. This is no \\"good guy, bad guy\\" movie. This is real life where everyone has a good and bad side and(I quote Daniel Plainview)where religion is nothing but a superstition. This is a place where power cries out to the ugly side of life and money pumps the veins and keeps our 75% souless existance moving foward and will surely be the reason for our demise. It seems a few reviewers here at amazon pretty much(in so many words)believe that they would have made a better movie than P.T. Anderson but to each is there own. A film like this was meant to provoke the viewer and leave it up to the individual to come out the otherside gripping his or her own conclusion and/or opinion in the same way a painting or a song can. All I know is I truly was moved by this film and all it's components especially the score and cinematography and still hold true to my opinion that Daniel Day Lewis may very well be the greatest actor alive!
0307387178|1.0|The main story is a good one and deserved to be told.  However, the book is padded with so many other tangents to fill out the covers that it pissed me off.  I found myself wondering when would we get back to the subject and why is he telling me about all these other people who have nothing to do with the storyline.  I'll tell you why...because the story about the main character is, at best, a short story.  Hope the movie is better.
B000JJRIO8|1.0|Afeni Shakur literally smoked so much crack when she was in the Black Panther era, she ACTUALLY BELIEVES, her dead son communicates with her!  \\"I believe whole-heartedly that Tupac sends the people he wants to these projects.\\"  Sounds like years of abusive crack smoking to me.       She's also using 2Pac's name to make a name for herself, and for her own profit.  How can she be a true mom, and sell his music different then they way he originally made it?  TUPAC IS NOT DISNEY!   DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!  Afeni only left ONE track untouched, because Quincy Jones didn't want her to ruin his song.  \\"If Its Not Broken...DON'T FIX IT!\\"
B000ZLFALI|2.0|I give this film two stars because it is gorgeous to look at. The colors and lush and beautiful, the sequences visually stimulating and fascinating.<br /><br />That's where it ends. A bunch of Beatles songs randomly strung together with little thought to why or how. Characters show up inexplicably; the actors utter lines like:<br /><br />Sadie: How did you get here?<br />Jude: She came in through the bathroom window.<br /><br />How unbelievably clever.<br /><br />As another reviewer put it, the names were overkill--you had Sadie, Jojo, Lucy, and Jude. There was a character named Prudence who had no point whatsoever. She shows up at the beginning to sing \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" to a female cheerleader from afar, apropos of nothing. I kinda thought that had potential to be an interesting story about her coming out. Wrong. I am fully convinced she only existed so that they could sing \\"Dear Prudence\\" to her. She disappears again, shows back up, and then is gone again.<br /><br />Some of the songs didn't even seem to match the sequences, as if the writer of the script just said, \\"Hey! I love this song. Let's put that here.\\"<br /><br />The sequence with Bono (\\"Dr. Robert,\\" naturally) singing \\"I Am the Walrus\\" seemed pretty pointless as well--not quite as pointless, though, as the sequence it led up to, consisting of a carnival featuring \\"For the Benefit of Mr. Kite.\\" This is where Prudence inexplicably shows up--she's run off and joined the circus. And as far as she's concerned, the end.<br /><br />The storylines started and then appeared to go nowhere. Jude comes to America to find his absentee American G.I. father and then--nothing happens. The father shows up randomly toward the end, and then disappears again. Wha?<br /><br />Such potential to be an interesting showcase of Beatles music and all squandered. All that's left is an overlong showcase of Beatles music, and as my husband, a huge Beatles fan, put it: \\"I can get the same effect by listening to my Beatles CDs, except that it's better because the masters are actually doing it themselves.\\"<br /><br />Don't believe the hype. You'll be disappointed.t themselves.\\"     Don't believe the hype. You'll be disappointed.
B0006MT314|5.0|Great Music...... Another plus for a great show! They are helping people find and make not so popular artist well known!
B000PC6Z48|5.0|Django is a masterpiece of the spaghetti western genre. It may be based on A Fistful of Dollars, but it has so much of its own unique style that it distances itself far enough away to avoid being a ripoff. Instead of battling weapon and liquor smugglers, our hero, Django, battles Mexican bandits and the KKK! That's right. All while dragging a coffin behind him, for reasons unknown to someone who's never seen the film.    I actually like this one way more than A Fistful of Dollars. Franco Nero as Django is just as awesome as Clint Eastwood in any of his \\"Dollars\\" roles. The music also spectacular and just as good as anything Morricone ever did. If you've ever even HEARD of this film, then you should just flat out order it RIGHT NOW.    By the way, this DVD presentation is excellent, and while a few frames are dirty, it's still the best way to see this film and doesn't hamper it at all. The DVD includes English and Italian language tracks. Please see it in Italian with English subs. It's meant to be watched that way. It makes the movie even more unique and stylish.
B0009P42S2|4.0|...with a great character driven plot, with characters who all have their own needs, wants, dreams and ideas for the future.  Science can be a tool of mankind or a weapon and in this full length animated film the many sides, dangers and rewards of science is explored.  Add good artwork, perfect voices and lots of cool steam powered machinery, lots of extras and you should have five stars.<br />But, and I say this knowing it will sound a tad whiny, it seems a tad long.  Not very long, more like ten minutes long.  The kind of long that editing a few seconds out of a scene here and there would have helped.  Get it new or used, but if you are an anime fan you should see it once.
B00136S0MK|5.0|This was a match made in \\"blues heaven\\". Some have lamented that Johnny Winter and James Cotton sings part of these tunes...somehow they just don't understand that all of these men are true legends of the blues.<br /><br />I saw Muddy Waters as the headliner in 1970. Ten Years After stole HIS show! He was going through the motions, but he pretty much \\"phoned in\\" his set. He looked and sound whipped. I saw this group at the Palladium in Los Angeles, CA. on 03/04/1977 (I still have the stub). Johnny Winter was producing and resurrected Muddy. Ever since Johnny had struck gold with The AND Band, he was a huge personality in the Rock and Roll genre and with the blues crowd. Muddy was a new man compared to what I saw in 1970. To this day, the show I witnessed in LA, was one of my all time favorite blues shows (and I seen dozens).<br /><br />Toss out the 2 star guy, he obviously doesn't understand the importance of this offering. If you LOVE THE BLUES, or you enjoy any of these featured artists, buy this one, you'll have no buyer's remorse.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Film review:    Obsession, pathos, cannibalism, buckets of blood, direction by Tim Burton, Johnny, Helena, and Alan singing a Sondheim score...what more could you want?  A macabre musical with truly dark humor, a full blown goth melodrama released for Christmas?  Tim Burton's vision doesn't disappoint and proves that you can achieve marvelous things working with the ones you love.  This film is incredibly fun and beautiful, and I would highly recommend it.  It's obviously not for everyone, but that said, it is masterful.    Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman turn in the strongest performances; truly a joy to watch.      Although I am a huge fan of Mr. Depp, and I enjoy his work in this film very much, Johnny seems to be relying on his bag of tricks in this portrayal of Sweeney Todd, rather than creating a unique character out of whole cloth.  I caught too many glimpses of Edward Scissorhands for my liking; it was a distraction to someone familiar with his other work.  But once again, Depp proves himself to be the most courageous artist in film today.  Honestly, who else could have played this impossible part, and pulled it off with such panache?    My teenage daughters and I saw this film several times in the theatre and eagerly await its release on DVD.  Destined to be a cult classic.
B000N3AWDE|5.0|I own every French album she has ever published. The English albums are nice and some of the English songs are very beautiful, BUT: There is absolutely no comparison when Dion sings in her native tongue. I have listened to most of her French music hundreds of times, and I love all of it.<br /><br />This latest 2007 release is, in my opinion, her best French album. Her complete control over the mood of the material is astounding. How she could ever do it so perfectly with all the pressures of her Las Vegas appearances is a mystery to me.<br /><br />But let me not forget the superb instrumental arrangements, the peerless quality of the musicians, and the flawless production overall. I do not know the French language at all, but the style of French compositions is very unique, especially when a singing talent like Celine Dion presents it so effortlessly.
B00005OM4K|5.0|I bought this and I am impressed it has every track and sounds great. A must buy.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|I should begin by specifying that there are different types of Radiohead fans, best identified by which album they consider their favorite.<br />I feel that, up to now, each album has been better than the previous, although I simply cannot decide whether Hail To The Thief is better than Amnesiac.<br />That said, I'd had higher hopes for In Rainbows, which may explain why I'm pretty disappointed with it.  While superior to 98% of the mainstream albums released in 2007, it is my least favorite from their discography.  It sounds more like a decent B-sides compilation from the Thief sessions.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I would like to upgrade my review to 4 stars.  For the first time, a Radiohead record has needed time to grow on me.  It has done just that, and I can confirm that it is every bit as good as Pablo Honey or The Bends.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|The late 60s and early 70s gave us a lot of different things to remember. Apparently one of them was the burgeoning business of drug dealing. While a number of drug smugglers came and went, there was one that made a killing, literally, during this time. His name was Frank Lucas and his story is told in this dynamic drama/biopic.<br /><br />Denzel Washington stars as Lucas, the right hand man of criminal mastermind Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III). When Bumpy passes away, Frank takes over his action in the streets of Harlem. At the same time, several others attempt to do the same. It only ends in a bloody finish with Frank on top.<br /><br />Looking for a way to make the sale of heroin more profitable, Frank decided to cut out the middle man and go direct. Via his cousin in Vietnam, he contacts one of the largest wholesale dealers there. The pair strike a deal and soon Frank is smuggling in large amounts, cutting it less than his competition and selling more and more.<br /><br />At the same time, an overly honest cop by the name of Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is doing his best to put an end to the dope dealers. Disliked by other policemen because of his honesty (he even turns in $1,000,000 that he finds during a stake out), Frank is sought out by his supervisor when a drug task force is formed in New Jersey. Choosing their men carefully, the team sets out to take down the suppliers of drugs rather than the street hustlers.<br /><br />The paths of these two men will eventually cross, but the story revolves more around Frank Lucas. Frank brings in his brothers to back him in his business dealings and sales. He rules the streets with a savage brutality and at the same time does what he can to help the people of the neighborhood. These people look up to him full well knowing what it is he does for a living.<br /><br />Preferring to attract as little attention to himself as possible, a single night wearing a fur coat to a championship boxing event leads to Frank's picture being taken. This is the first step that Richie and his team take to discovering that Frank is the main supplier of heroin in the city. It is the first step in the end of Frank's reign of the streets.<br /><br />As always, Washington does a fantastic job in his performance here, exuding the cool, calculated ways of Frank Lucas as well as the outburst of anger and menace when times change. Crowe does an admirable job as well, showing Richie's discomfort with public speaking and his change, the confidence he gains as he reaches that moment where he captures the man behind the myth.<br /><br />Brutal, honest and a true story to boot, this movie is one that should be seen not only for the tale of two individuals but as a precautionary tale for anyone considering this lifestyle as well as the toll taken by heroin users. A bonus here is interviews with both the real life Richie Roberts and Frank Lucas who helped with the making of this movie. To think that Lucas made it back to the free world is amazing. To think he lived to see a movie made of his life is even more so.st step that Richie and his team take to discovering that Frank is the main supplier of heroin in the city.

0786891084|4.0|I really enjoyed this book!  I didn't find the letter format irrating at all.  Actually, I think it was really clever and told the story beautifully.    I read in a couple of reviews that the format prevented the author from developing Rosie's character, and I have to say that I wholeheartedly disagree.  I have grown tired of reading books featuring the same type of character (like in the Sophie Kinsella books) who is irresponsible, silly, but sweet.  Rosie was down-to-earth, intelligent, and reasonable.  It was refreshing to read a light book with a realitic main character.  Can't wait to read more from Ahern.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Paramore is a rock band I never heard of til the Grammy's (nominated for best new artist) so I decided to check out their sound. I read up on the band and found out they are from Franklin, Tennessee. I was pretty excited about that and loved their videos so picked up their second album, Roit! I have been listening to this album nonstop, this is an amazing band, Hayley Williams is a strong and gutsy singer, the rest of the band know how to play their instruments, I see big things for this band in the future. Every song has a catchy chorus, nice hooks, and clever melodies thanks to Hayley's colorful phrasing (love that red hair too!). I never skip any of the eleven tracks, you get a little bit of everything like somber tracks such as When It Rains and We Are Broken. Hayley's vocals soar on Misery Business, Let the Flames Begin, and Hallejulah.  My fave track is crushcrushcrush, gets stuck in your head, very infectious.  I will definitely check out the band's debut album, All We Know is Falling. I highly recommend Roit! It's fun, lively, and well-produced. Buy it today!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This was a wonderful, beautiful movie!  IMHO this is Zellweger's best performance, and I do like some of her other films like Chicago.  This is such a sweet movie, I had to show it to my mother, who absolutly fell in love with it.  Not too many great movies come out, but this was one.
1572814349|4.0|I find this deck very easy to read though it is hard to shuffle.  I took another reviewer's advice and limbered the cards over the edge of my table to make them more flexible during shuffling.  This has helped some.  The card stock out of which the deck is made is thicker than other cards which makes the cards stiffer and the deck harder to handle since the whole deck is deeper and hard to get your hand around, and I have larger hands.  This said the artwork is lovely.      I was expecting to see gilt on the front of the card too, to some extent, which it is not.  Only the outside edges of the cards are gilted and lovely, but on the face or back, the \\"gold\\" is really just yellow printing.    I'll let the other reviewers say the rest.  I do like this deck.  It seems to convey deep spiritual meaning, especially from the Majors.  The minors are enough like Rider Waite that reading is fairly easy.
0143038419|5.0|In my mind it is no coincidence that Elizabeth Gilbert only chose to travel to countries that begin with the letter \\"I\\". Her journey was all about self-discovery - all about the \\"me\\" - all about the \\"I\\"!  Because of her mastery at crafting beautiful images, dialogue and characters I too was able to join on this journey.  She made it so easy for me to taste the sweetness of pistachio gelato while sitting by an ancient moss-covered fountain. I wanted to take the next flight to Rome and speak the idioms she lovingly shared. I just knew that her favorite phrase \\"attraversiamo\\" would roll off my tongue like a native. The phrase means \\"let's cross over\\" and that's exactly what I did as she traveled to each new country. I traversed terrains filled with pleasure, self-doubt, joy, resistance, surrender and finally well-being.  The well-being came wrapped in a cloth I'll call \\"self-love\\".     It is no coincidence that the book \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" crossed my path. Guests would come to stay at my home and leave their copy on the coffee table. Subway rides were enlivened by counting how many times I saw the pasta, prayer bead, and orchid cover spelling out the title name.  I do believe that serendipity has a marvelous way of leading us to the places we need to go. It led me to reading \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" as well as another gem [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]].  If you like journeys of the mind, journeys of the heart or journeys where you live and love the moment -don't miss reading these two jewels.
B00110K62U|3.0|I absolutely love this concert! It has some wonderful music, and the very best singers around. I own the original DVD and am very happy with it. The reason I bought this copy was because it was in widescreen format, and I hoped it would offer a better viewing experience - to make you feel more like you were there. It accomplishes this nicely! Unfortunately, there is an error in the video transfer and a small section of singing is omitted. In the section where Gavroche (the little boy) exposes Javert as a spy, and sing's \\"Little People\\" - the part of the song where he sings, \\"Good evening Inspector, lovely evening my dear...his name's Inspector Javert\\" this whole section has been left out - and it is quite obvious! I thought maybe it was a defect on my copy but I have seen another copy and this same error is present. Maybe I'm too picky, but I expect perfection when it comes to my DVD's, and this is just too careless a mistake on the publisher's part.
B000002UAU|5.0|Reading a lot of the other reviews saying that this record is \\"horrible\\" and \\"for old people\\" is ridiculous.[I'm only 22]  This record is awesome.  there is a reason in 2003 it was named by Rolling Stone magazine as the #1 Album of All Time.  Yes, sadly Biggie and 2pac were not number one and neither was Dark Side of the Moon.  If the Beatles are so bad then why does every artist today still cover songs? Even more about this album, almost every rock group has covered a song off of this album.  The covers are great but nothing compares to the original.
B0000033J9|5.0|If not number one, Maurice Jarre's sweeping, beautiful score for David Lean's \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" is certainly in the top three of the greatest film scores ever composed. Lean and Jarre had already proven a magical combination on their previous collaboration - \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\". But with \\"Doctor Zhivago\\", Jarre would arguably make his finest creation, and certainly his most famous - the ubiquitous, sweepingly romantic \\"Lara's Theme\\".<br /><br />Rarely, if ever, has a score captured the feel and emotions of a film so well. The Overture alone showcases the film's juxtaposition between the romantic and personal, and the inevitable, tragic tide of history. The score is unbelievably complex, ranging from tragic to upbeat to haunting to stirring. It is truly a remarkable achievement, and the score is plenty effective on its own.<br /><br />The CD features a plethora of highly memorable pieces. While the more critical might grow weary of the umpteenth rendition of \\"Lara's Theme\\", this reviewer wouldn't, and in any case might point the cynic to the many other cues on the soundtrack. The early segments of the soundtrack contain mostly indifferent incidental music, but around track 10 the show starts to kick into high gear. The haunting \\"They Began to Go Home\\", \\"After Deserters Kill the Colonel\\", and \\"Yuri is Taken Prisoner By the Red Partisans\\" convey the tragic, unavoidable violence of Russia's civil war. Anyone who wants something other than romance would hardly find a more stirring and violent contrast than here. Much of the incidental music is surprisingly good too - the heart-rending \\"Kontakion\\", \\"Evening Bells-Moscow Bells\\", and the ominous \\"Yevgraf Snaps His Fingers\\" are highlights.<br /><br />The heart-breaking Main Title, Lara Says Goodbye To Yuri, the build-up to crescendo in \\"Yuri and the Daffodils\\", and \\"On a Yuriatin Street\\" are the most notable renditions of Lara's Theme, and each is moving in its own way; there's enough variation to prevent these tracks from becoming monotonous. And in any case, the piece is so beautiful in its own right that it's difficult to complain about it, in my view.<br /><br />Beautiful artwork, liner notes, and a few fun bonus tracks only add to the experience. \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" is, simply, one of the most memorable, emotional and versatile film scores ever written - a sweeping experience that transcends the film.d in any case, the piece is so beautiful in its own right that it's difficult to complain about it, in my view.

B000R6PKP2|5.0|I purchased this Blu-Ray version for myself for Christmas, and was very happy when I received it. I had seen the Director Cut not too long ago on dvd, and I just recently saw this Final Cut on the big screen in my area.<br />The briefcase seems a little flimsy, and it would have been great if it was an actual metal case. I do like the other collector's items in the case.<br />I have only seen the Final Cut (newest) version on the Blu-Ray, but plan to eventually watch all the other version. Picture quality and sound quality is excellent. I have also watched the 3+ hour \\"Making of\\" and it was really wonderful!<br />I strongly recommend this briefcase version for any true Blade Runner fan!
B000Y7U98C|4.0|Sunshine is a marvelously paced sci-fi thriller.  From the opening monologue to the inevitable conclusion, I was drawn in to the semi-plausible situation (willing suspension of disbelief helps to get past the ridiculous \\"science\\") of a crew sent on a probable suicide mission to reignite the sun.  Each character, if not fully fleshed out, at least offers a glimpse into their motivations, emotions, and thoughts.  The combined psychological impact of the world-saving mission along with the desolate circumstances involved strips each person to the core, revealing who they really are.    The sense of isolation is palpable as the spaceship, Icarus II, passes into \\"the dead zone\\" where radio transmission becomes impossible.  As the crew slowly dwindles in number due to human error and the unforgiving forces of nature, a sense of fatalistic dread imposes itself on the remaining crew - which is really awesome for you, the viewer.  An unexpected (for me, at least) twist adds the element of horror to the film.  Some of the more pretentious reviewers have disparaged that plot device, but it worked for me.    Several shots of the movie are homages to 2001, Alien, and Event Horizon - all flicks centered on the horror of the absolute isolation of space.  Sunshine is a legitimately great addition to that list.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I was stoked about this album and listened to it straight through twice in a row. I'm listening to it now, as a matter of fact.     It's interesting that a lot of reviewers on here make a statement that they are NOT \\"narrow-minded\\" music lovers, or they respect a band's right to experiment and go different directions, but then, in the very next sentence, they say this album is nothing like Linkin Park from previous albums, therefore, it's trash. First, I don't think that is necessarily true. There is plenty of the old LP here to keep the band grounded, but, personally, I enjoyed the slower tracks because they showed a more mature and developed sound and lyric style. Amazing job! I loved it and keep it coming LP.

0307387178|4.0|This is the story of Chris McCandless, a young man from an affluent family who graduated with honors from Emory University in Atlanta. In April, 1992, Chris set off into the Alaska wilderness with a rifle and meager supplies to \\"live off the land.\\" He headed north of Denali National Park. He was idealistic and strongly influenced by the writings of Tolstoy. Four months later, he was found dead by a party of moose hunters in an abandoned Fairbanks city bus. He had starved to death.<br /><br />Jon Krakauer traces Chris' odyssey across the west. Chris' parents had assumed their son would go to law school with a major in history. Instead, he donated his college fund to charity and left with no word. He changed his name to Alex Supertramp, abandoned his car and took to hitchhiking. He traipsed through Arizona, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington. He lived off rice. He was liked by the people he met. He worked for a man named Wayne Westerberg in South Dakota. He befriended an 80-year-old veteran.<br /><br />Chris kept a journal in which he wrote about himself in the third person. He saw himself as a modern Thoreau. He camped in the Grand Canyon. He worked in a restaurant in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, his parents were worried sick.<br /><br />Krakauer identifies with Chris and portrays him as different from others who wander off in the wilderness. Chris' story and Krakauer's merge. Krakauer grew up in Oregon and learned mountain climbing from his father. He spent time in Alaska as a young man and climbed a peak known as Devils Thumb. He writes about it in detail, relating his mistakes and the unforgiving nature of mountains, ice and freezing temperatures. He questions why he survived Alaska while Chris perished.<br /><br />It got out of hand with Chris. His disregard for his parents and contempt for the rules of society are hard to defend. His asceticism and high-mindedness were extreme. He became an aimless drifter, a selfish nonconformist.<br /><br />We are shown the source of Chris' resentment toward his father. His father had another family by a first marriage. Krakauer exposes the gap between him and his own father.<br /><br />As Chris' wanderlust grew, he thought more and more of Alaska. He hitched a ride from Dawson Creek in Canada along the Alaska Highway to Fairbanks. He bought a rifle and hitched on the George Parks Highway toward the wilderness. He wanted to escape all civilization. He saw Mt. McKinley in the distance. He found the bus and made it his home. For awhile, he was able to live off birds, squirrels and other small game. Krakauer's theory that Chris was poisoned by wild potato seeds proved untrue. Krakauer did not want to believe Chris had a death wish as critics have proposed. Still, Chris was not that deep into the bush and might have saved himself had he the will to do so.<br /><br />\\"Into the Wild\\" became a movie in 2007 starring Emile Hirsch and Vince Vaughn.

B0009S2T0M|4.0|\\"Oldboy\\" is a fascinating mix of Western and Asian cinema, with equal bits Hitchcock, Kubrick and 21st century Asian horror.  On one level, \\"Oldboy\\" is a classic man-wrongly-accused story of the type Hitchcock did so well - but neither we nor Dae-Su know what he is accused of.  Indeed, \\"Oldboy\\" starts off as man-wrongly-punished - or is he?  Park sets up the camera and lets it remain stationary a la Kubrick for much of the movie, adding to the tension by making us unsure of when he will cut away.  And us Western viewers will wish he had cut away from some of the more gonzo horror scenes.  Asian horror is far more transgressive than American horror, and while this film does not descend to the same depths that a Takashi Miike film would, several scenes go beyond what we Americans are used to, even in a post-\\"Hostel\\" world.  Even the subject matter, which is revealed at the end, is much more transgressive than what we would expect from an American movie.<br /><br />Having said that, \\"Oldboy\\" has no shortage of humor, interesting characters, and artistic choices - shades of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and Tarantino's other films.  As such, \\"Oldboy\\" may be one of the more accessible films to those new to Asian cinema.  And it includes a psychopathic Stanford grad, to boot.<br /><br />I knocked off a star due to some pacing issues, and an ending that didn't quite fit with the rest of the film.  Without ruining the ending, it lasts too long, and where we should be racing for the curtain, there is overwrought melodrama and general wasting of time.  I thought this was over 10 minutes before it was.<br /><br />Nevertheless, fans of suspense, action and horror will enjoy this, as will fans of Asian cinema and people who are interested in Asian cinema.  \\"Oldboy\\" is worth at least a rent.
B00003CXA2|4.0|I hated this movie at first. I had to go out in the lobby during the combat scene. Even though I did not go to Vietnam, I felt like I did. Forrest moves from Elvis and The Beatles to the disco era. He finds himself in Washington, D.C., the ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances. I later developed an affection for Tom Hanks' character when I went to D.C. with my son. We joked about Forrest's girl friend, Jenny, running through the Reflecting Pool. The story ends with Jenny dying of AIDS. Seeing the quintessential boomer life unfold can be painful.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|Saw the movie \\"Once\\" and could not get the music out of my head. So thought might as well get the soundtrack. Price is great, and shipping as always was super fast. Very haunting music and a must for anyone who loved the movie.     Hope it does well at the Oscars!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|V For Vendetta is the rarest of things: A work of art that manages to be both commercially viable and uncompromisingly subversive. It's an arrestingly stylish, devastatingly smart movie whose every scene demands attention and contemplation. Without being preachy or condescending, it demands that its viewers think. Without resorting to cliche or cheap sentiment, it packs a hell of an emotional wallop. Without resorting to cardboard-cutout characterization or vague moralizing (and this is the really cool part), it sends an impossible-to-ignore message about right, wrong, oppression, revolution, responsibility, and the role of the individual.  And at the same time, it's incredibly fun to watch.    The plot is a bit complex (and besides, watching the story unfold is half the fun. Well, more like a third of the fun. But I digress...), but here's what you should know: Our story takes place in an unpleasant future. England has fallen under the power of a very oppressive, very totalitarian regime, which has come to power by riding a wave of fear triggered by a surge in terrorist attacks. Free expression and democracy are things of the past, all information is controlled by the government, anyone who complains winds up disappearing, and God help you if you're a Muslim. What sets this brave new world apart from (and ahead of) other, lesser cinematic dystopias is its incredible atmosphere. This England is a creeping sort of nightmare, a strange and hostile place that evokes dread and paranoia with a throbbing undercurrent of tension. As anyone who's ever been across the pond (for those of you joining us from Europe, Asia, Africa, or Australia, \\"on your side of the pond\\") can probably tell you, the setting of V For Vendetta is an uncannily dark mirror image of the Isle that we all know and love. It's atmospheric, hypnotic, and undeniably powerful. This setting is populated by an equally engaging cast of heroes and villains- from the charismatic and utterly ruthless High Chancellor Adam Sutler to the oddly sympathetic government inspector Eric Finch to the film's twin protagonists, Evey Hammond and V, just about everybody in this film is a wonderfully drawn, finely crafted example of characterization at its sharpest. It's a stage full of Hamlets  and Mia Wallaces, without a single Jar Jar Binks to ruin the flow.    The story itself, which concerns V's yearlong crusade against the tyranny that has fallen on hi nation, is simply brilliant. V himself is a stunningly drawn character, an incredibly complex man whose cool charisma and literate style belie a troubled, vulnerable sort of humanity. It's not always easy to agree with his methods- he resorts to acts of violence that border on anarchic terrorism- but therein lies the brilliance of the movie: V For Vendetta doesn't aim to make us blindly sympathize with its central character. Rather, it demands that we think, forces us to consider our own views on revolution, freedom, revenge, and violence. Is it right to defy a government if we see its actions as unjust? Can one man's actions speak for the ideas of many? Is it ever right to kill another human being? The questions may be as old as time, but this movie casts them in a startlingly new light.    And it's entertaining, too: The plot is genuinely suspenseful and engaging, full of twists, and revelations. The action scenes are fantastically choreographed, the dialog is razor-sharp, the visuals are unforgettable, and the climax is simply gorgeous. This one oughtta go down as a classic.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|I don't know if anyone else noted this (I didn't have time to read all 500+ reviews), but the French language version on the Blu-ray disc is not simply dubbed. All of the mouth movements of the characters appear to have been completely re-animated to match the French dialogue, and virtually all signs, book covers, newspaper articles and such that were in English in the American version have been changed to French text. (However, when Remy first begins reading Gusteau's book near the beginning of the movie, the animators appear to have goofed, and the text appears in English.)
6305161879|4.0|I have always thought this film was very funny.  Basically the end of Jamie Lee Curtis & Kevin Kline's careers.  NEVER had another hit film either of them.    This is a film that needed an updated DVD package.  No extras at all.  Won an Oscar for Kline & was a hit but this package has NO extras.  Glad a n updated DVD package is always available.      \\"Don't call me stupid\\".    My rating is for the film not for the bare nothing special DVD package.   Extras, where are the extras?      I never liked Palin's character Ken.    Does have both wide screen & stand versions of the film depending on what you prefer.    Does have a good brochure with film information plus chapter search list.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|Loosely based on historical occurences, \\"Elizabeth - The Golden Age\\" is nonetheless a feast for the eyes.  Excellent cinematography and photography are just icing on a cake of superb acting.  Cate Blanchet, Clive Owen and Geoffrey Rush are as excellent as ever in this continuation of Kapur's version of the story of Elizabeth I of England.<br /><br />In 1585 Elizabeth I turned 53 years of age, and young looking Cate (though mentioning increasing lines in the film) throws back us nerdy history majors who enjoy a good Tudor story.  Elizabeth faces two challenges - Mary Queen of Scotts and Spanish Armada.  The film, like the first one, was filled with intrigue and romanticized versions of Elizabeth's relationships.  There, of course, are accuracies, and I find it funny that some reviewers balk at a historically accurate part of the film.<br /><br />One of those was the scene in which Elizabeth rides on her horse in her armor to speak to her troops just before the Spanish Armada.  One reviewer called it \\"a cheap rip-off of Braveheart.\\"  In all actuality, Elizabeth did do this, and Kapur did not even include the biggest (and most oft quoted part) of her speech:\\"I may have a body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have a heart and stomach of a King, and of a King of England, too.\\"  I wish that Kapur added that part.  Another bit I wish Kapur (who seems set on the dramatic) included, purely for increasing the dramatic by using historically accurate, is the fact that the executioner had to hit Mary Queen of Scotts' neck twice in order to sever the head.  After beheading, Mary's wig fell off as her head rolled on the floor, exposing wispy white hair of a once beautiful woman, resulting in an undignified death for a dignified monarch, who went to her death with her head held high.<br /><br />Clive Owen does an excellent job as Sir Walter Raleigh, and Geoffrey Rush shines as Sir Francis Walsingham.  In fact, the entire cast is stellar and they fully carry the somewhat rushed film, helped by stunning photography.  Musical pieces used in the first Elizabeth helped connect with that film.  Kapur is planning on doing a third Elizabeth film.  Although mostly historically inaccurate, the Elizabeth films are beautifully done, and highly recommended.
B0001CNRB6|1.0|I don't write reviews very often, but watch out for this one!  My wife and I have loved every Doris Day film we have seen until now.  This one is all about sex. It is not funny or romantic unless you like that sort of thing. I just wanted to warn those of you who enjoyed the \\"Pillow Talk\\" kind of film, this one is NOT for the family!
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|\\"Midnight Express\\" is a true story of a 20 year old American Billy Hayes, who tried to smuggle two kilograms of hashish out of Turkey.  Billy got searched at the Istanbul Airport, and the Turkish police arrested Billy.  In return for cooperation the police offered leniency, which Billy accepted.  Unfortunately, Billy tried to escape while cooperating with local authorities.  Billy now has to face the wrath of the Turkish justice system, which mainly wants to make an example out of foreigners, especially Americans used to getting away with Billy's behavior back in the States.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Express\\" was an instant classic as soon as it was released in 1978.  Little was known about Muslim countries and levels of freedom, if any.  This film showed just the amount of freedom people in a westernized Muslim country received.  Istanbul is both in Europe and Asia, a large, cosmopolitan city, so it's that more of a shock to encounter a prison like the one Billy ended in in this beautiful city.<br /><br />Thirty years later, even with the current state-of-the-art films, \\"Midnight Express\\" still has the same effect.  Some movies are just made to last, and this is definitely one of them.  Movie music has definitely changed since 1978 (and I am glad that it has), but otherwise this film shows us there can still be low budget films that endure the test of time.  Highly recommended.
0060512806|5.0|People keep putting Neal Stephenson's books into \\"science fiction\\".   Even if they take place today, or 60 years ago.   Yes I loved it, but I think his books are increasingly miscategorized.    Or perhaps there's a hidden meaning to \\"science fiction\\".    I think it's this:      In order to make a book interesting you have to make something extreme or weird or new.   In many books, authors resort to making one or more characters cruel or psychologically tortured, depressed or otherwise dysfunctional.    In \\"science fiction\\", the characters are generally intellient, clever, well balanced and otherwise normal....  it's just the world they inhabit that's gone arwy.    Something is only reviewed as \\"serious literature\\" if the characters are broken in some way, but if the *world* is wrong.... it's called \\"science fiction\\".  Even if it takes place 40 years ago.
B000VT6FAO|2.0|To be honest, I wasn't impressed with David Gahan's \\"Paper Monsters\\" album, nor am I impressed with this one. Solo efforts to me means that the artist wants to \\"break away\\" from the sound of the band as a whole and branch out and do something introspective and different. That doesn't happen here. I hear Depeche Mode, not David Gahan. I actually was more inpressed with Martin L. Gore's solos efforts: \\"Counterfeit\\" and \\"Counterfeit 2\\" although the songs are all covers, Mr. Gore gives them a new twist that really had me impressed.
B000002LAB|4.0|As other reviewers have written, this record does have that \\"80's\\" sound to it, and well, being that it was recorded in 1986, are you surprised?     However, it has a sound that Miles and Marcus Miller basically created themselves, which is something to admire and respect. I know some jazz \\"puritans\\" will scoff at the use of electronics and drum machines here, but hasn't jazz always really been about innovation and stepping out of the typical, mundane aspects of standard 1234 song writing? At the time, that's exactly what Miles and Marcus were doing. They were approaching music in new ways, just as Miles did in the 50's-70's, and in the 80's, that involved electronics and drum machines and etc.    Regardless, there is good stuff here. I love the moody \\"Portia\\" and was especially pleased with the Jamaican-dub influenced \\"Don't Lose Your Mind\\". I've been listening to 70's dub (highly recommended) a lot lately and even though the two styles intertwine, I was surprised to hear a boppin' bassline with jazzy reggae rhythms and even a slight echo-like keyboard on this release.    In all honesty, if I was at a cocktail lounge in 1986 and heard this, I'd likely give it 5 stars. However, I'm a young one (born in 81) and I'm sure I'm slighting this release because of it. Nonetheless, young or old, there is music here to appreciate.
B00104W8T6|5.0|This is the best movie soundtrack I have heard in a while. Great mix of genres. Most of the songs are upbeat, though there are a couple nice mellow songs as well. Though some of the singers, Moldy Peaches for instance, have somewhat awkward voices, it still sounds good.  Whoever picked the songs for this movie did an excellent job because all of them vibe with the film really well. I definitely recommend buying the soundtrack (and the movie when it comes out).
B000002WU9|1.0|This album is overrated, BAD BEATS, I MEAN BAD, I can make better beats with a stick and a rock. Nas sucks
B000VS6R26|5.0|Director Cameron paid amazing attention to detail, recreating every set to look exactly like photos of the real ship. The engine room is a masterpiece. Filmed on a living, restored Liberty Ship (whose powerplant is a fraction of the size of Titanic's), CGI was employed to create miniature catwalks and tiny blackgang crew, and the impression of coal-stoked operation. Costumes and accessories, even the meals served, were faithfully replicated. Actors were chosen who actually resemble the historical figures in the supporting cast. The special effects involved in the sinking, utilizing a full scale model, are spectacular. Likewise the remarkable authentic footage taken from the real Russian research ship and minisubs. By brilliantly framing the past story in the present, Cameron shares with his audience his own wondrous experience of visiting the Titanic in her North Atlantic grave. A marvelous film!!
B000P12LWY|5.0|Lust, sex, conflict, intrigue, political drama......is all part of THE TUDORS, season 1. This a totally entertaining, well acted and presented work. Enjoy!
0790734850|5.0|Back in the day when the cops were dirty, the women were dames, and the music was jazz; LA Confidential delivers a perfect portrayl of Los Angles during the early 1950s.  This is a brilliantly crafted crime drama based on James Ellroy's novel.  The characters and the places appear to be so real that you wonder if this really happened (it didn't).  Kim Basinger won the Oscar for her role as the \\"high classed whore cut to look like Veronica Lake\\".  Guy Pearce truly shines as an up and coming police detective.  Its amazing that this guy isn't a $20 mil/picture star.  With enough twists and turns to keep anyone enthralled, give this a look...in fact don't look, buy it.  You will watch it again and again.
B001041JLE|5.0|It's hard to believe it has been 25 years since Thriller.  I still remember the first time I saw Michael moonwalk on Motown 25.  The Thriller album was so popular because it appealed to so many different demographics, something we will probably never witness again.  The album related to ages 8-80.  The music is still tremendously strong.  \\"Wanna Be Startin\\" Somethin' is a vocal tour de force and is still influential today (Think the refrain of Rhianna \\"Don't Stop The Music\\").  \\"Billie Jean\\" a dark, pulsating R&B marvel is arguably Michael's best song ever. \\"The Lady In My Life\\" is quiet storm at its best as Michael is over zealous for his true love.  Other highlights include the AOR staple \\"Beat It\\" with electrifying guitar interplay from Eddie Van Halen and \\"Thriller\\" the ultimate Halloween party anthem. There is no filler here as all 9 songs are first rate.  It is a timeless album and remains a highwater mark for Michael Jackson and producer Quincy Jones.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|2-DVD set of James Bond \\"Casino Royale\\"  I rate the film as a 5-Star!!
B000YENUI6|4.0|The only other movie I can really compare to where the information was so well researched would probably be [[ASIN:B0001NBNB6 The Godfather]] and TV show [[ASIN:B00003CXOP The Sopranos]] which really gave the audience watching a glimpse into what the lives of members of the organised crime generation experiance.    This movie is also in that tradition. Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of a gangster having to do the right thing by his family is amazing. naomi watts does well to play the opposing role to him too. I really dont want to go further into it. But a warning: This movie is quite gory and graphic, so not for those that feel uneasy seeing violence on the screen.    Watch it if you are a fan of the organised crime movie genre. Cronenberg has made a master peice and it would be a shame if it does not win an oscar.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|Sweet Jesus what a lousy movie. What a pretentious, plodding, over-ripe and under-written piece of tripe. The 60s as interpreted by people who weren't there and think that a street protest montage Says It All. You know you're in trouble when you hear lines like \\"My name's Jude.\\" \\"My name is Lucy.\\" In the sky, with diamonds, GET IT? While I regret spending $18 on this bomb, at least I had the pleasure of shutting it off in the middle, whereas if I had paid $10 to see it in a theater, I might have felt obligated to sit through the whole mess. Nice photography, though.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|fter the blow-me-down-with-a-feather surprise appeal of the acoustic half of Foo Fighters' midlife-crisis double album [[ASIN:B0009HLDFU In Your Honor]], Norah Jones duet `n all, a live-acoustic victory lap was probably inevitable. It's not a terrible idea: when the eight-piece configuration hits its stride, Skin and Bones approximates the Springsteen-ization of the Foos shiny, toothy sound, adding some satisfying clout to the acoustic numbers. But like a sixteeen-year-old's hard-on, Grohl's songs haven't the finesse nor the staying power for the intimate treatment.     Skin and Bones is no MTV Unplugged. Grohl has something else in mind--warmer and more triumphal. Trouble is, unlike Nirvana, Grohl's songs are good but seldom great. Under a conventional acoustic arrangement, \\"My Hero\\" turns, as the song suggests, quite ordinary, even ponderous in places, something never true of the original; the song's lyrical muscle atrophies from too much gravity, or possibly too little.     About halfway through Skin and Bones, it's uncomfortably obvious how much of Grohl's considerable charisma is invested in his throttled howl and armored sound. In traditional registers, his rather bland voice and blander phrasing on \\"February Stars\\" sound like a second-rate folkie. \\"Next Year\\" has the cheerful sheen of a twelve-string and mandolin strummed in unison, but still meanders rather fruitlessly. \\"Big Me\\" contrives to be loungey without the unexpected class of \\"Virginia Moon.\\" Thing is, when you strip these songs to skin and bones, there's not always a whole lot left; the secret of a good Foos song lies in the texture, as bristly and satisfying as a two-day-old beard.     Somewhat surprisingly then, the best of these performances are the sparest. The title track begins with Grohl strumming a fragile minor-key pattern and adds organ and percussive mass. Even better is Grohl's solo take on \\"The Best of You,\\" prefaced by an acknowledgement that a Foo Fighters show that omits Grohl's shredding isn't worth the price of admission. As Grohl blasts through the blustery song and its insistent one-note chorus, you can hear those magnificent sinews in his neck stretching. His growl bleeds all over the acoustic strumming and simple lyrics, until he dissolves in a Howard Dean-worthy screech. The acoustic experiment was fun, but the sooner the Fighters get back to combating Foo with their full arsenal, the better.
B000000XCD|5.0|This was CCR's third album.  There were two singles released from it.  The a-sides (\\"Green River\\" and \\"Bad Moon Rising\\") each reached #2 on the Hot 100, while the b-sides (\\"Commotion\\" and \\"Lodi\\") topped out at #30 and #52, respectively.  These are great songs that many people are familiar with, but there are five other very good songs on the album.  John Fogerty wrote all the songs, with the exception of the closing cover of the Ray Charles song \\"The Night Time is the Right Time\\".  This is arguably CCR's first \\"great\\" album.
B000068OSK|4.0|I have to admit, listening to this gem was a bit of a struggle at first, but behold, the white stripes after a couple of listens have a ray of sunlight shine through with their first album (self titled no less).     Quite simply, through the noise, the distorted yelping and singing with off key moments, distortion on guitars and what seems to be almost teenage angst, there is a silver lining to this dark cloud.     If you have listened to the white stripes prior to this, you will notice that recording is a lot rawer then the past. I call it raw, what i really mean is quite poor quality, but thats because jack white recorded this on a shoe-string budget.     Give it a go, even if its to just finish off your collection you will be suprised with this album. two thumbs up, but not the perfect white stripes album, not by a long shot.
0446691437|5.0|It's uncanny how accurate this book depicts the life and struggles of a writer and perhaps any artist. Before I became a writer I was a professional actor and it resonated for me in that area as well. It was as if Stephen had a hidden camera in my office while he was writing.<br /><br />Except for the solutions he proposes. That and the truths it provides are the best things about this book.<br /><br />Here are just a couple of those truths:<br /><br />\\"We are not born with unlimited choices... Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal that we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we already are and become it.\\"<br /><br />\\"There never was a moment, and never will be, when we are without the power to alter our destiny.<br /><br />On every page, I found things I laughed at and learned from. Pressfield poses the argument that Resistance is the Enemy! Resistance is the name of the thing I didn't even know I was fighting. Resistance is the thing that will force you to crave the very things that keep you from your work: instant gratification, rationalization, and procrastination. If you want to overcome the power of Resistance? Read This Book.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Forget what the haters say. This is better  than \\"Nevermind\\", \\"Bleach\\", and \\"In Utero\\", It's got only the best singles and is very worthy of being called a greatest hits compilation.      BUY THIS!!!
B000YXMMAE|1.0|I'm a Radiohead fan since 1993, remember \\"Creep\\" from \\"Pablo Honey\\"? Remember \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\", \\"Thinking About You\\", \\"You\\"? I think they're great songs; an certainly you would expect Radiohead to evolve during these years, but I can't digest the musical direction the band took with these album. I was very excited when I read about this new Radiohead album and it's popularity, so I listened to it as soon as I could: big deception. Lack of climax in the whole record, the songs seemed to me like those bonus tracks where the band is jamming repeating patterns over a over again and improvising melodies. I began to skip tracks looking for a \\"good\\" song, but my search was in vain. I don't understand why this album became so popular; maybe just because it was a free download for a while?
B000929AJQ|5.0|I reccommend this album 100%. This is the best NIN album to date. This is truly a MUST BUY. To me, a complete NIN collection isn't P.H.M, Downward Spiral, The Fragile, With Teeth, Year Zero. To me, a complete NIN collection is \\"With Teeth\\", that's all you need (but if you must have a second album, make it either \\"The Fragile\\" or \\"The Downward Spiral\\"). Can I get an amen. The best songs include \\"With Teeth\\", \\"Only\\", and \\"Halo 8/The Hand that Feeds\\".          Trent is incredible, though, he's one man and look how far he's come in his musical career and how popular he's become, and how many albums he's sold. Buy this album today, for 1 to enjoy one of Trent's greatest works and amazing songs (lyrically and quality-wise) and second to support my pick as \\"the best Industrial artist ever\\" (50% royalties go to Trent if you buy it new from Amazon).      So again: I reccommend that you buy this masterpiece that is a greatest hits compilation in itself.      Thank you for releasing this wonderful album, Trent, and here's to many more albums and wonderful music-making years.    BUY THIS ALBUM TODAY!!!      WITH_TEETH

0143038419|5.0|I really enjoyed reading about her personal journey.  I could not personally relate to everything about her story (I've never been married, nor am I as outgoing as she seems to be), but I did feel inspired by her journey toward self-discovery.  After reading the book, I realized that I've always placed too much emphasis on what I think other people expect of me.  I felt inspired to start meditating and reflecting on my own personal desires.
B00005JPXY|5.0|This one roller coaster ride of a movie. Once it grabs you, it does not let go. A little ways into the party where you see the everyday lives of Manhatanites, all becomes irrelevant once the monster makes its debut.  The action is nonstop, there is a conmstant feeling of dread and anxiety.  The special effects are spectacular. The military pounds this thing to no avail and you, the viewer, are right in the middle of the action.  The creature's growl is excellent. You can sense the anger.  Even when you don't see it, the creature still has a strong presense.  When you see the creature, you are completely bewildered.  This is a jaw dropping spectacle that you will have a blast experiencing.  I don't think any movie rides can come close to this movie.  This movie is like a nightmare that once it is over....  You thank God it was only a movie.  I STRONGLY recommend this to giant monster enthusiasts everywhere.  This is a must see.
B000002KHH|5.0|This is one of the best albums by black sabbath. I have one thing to say Ozzy Osbourne may be insane but hes awesome!!!!!!!!!!
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|At first, this album struck me as an oddity.  I found it entertaining, but not necessarily all that impressive.  But, with repeated listens, I must admit that it's really grown on me a great deal.  It definitely has its own charms, found in a combination of sounds, acoustic and electric, traditional and otherwise, that create an absolutely unique and innovative album.<br /><br />There are some really top notch tracks, here.  \\"Tin Pan Valley,\\" \\"All the King's Horses,\\" and \\"The Enchanter\\" are a strong trio and a very impressive middle of the album, which bleeds right into an incredible groove on \\"Takamba,\\" perhaps the most Zeppelin-like of all the tracks on the album, and it's this great middle that really carries the entire album.<br /><br />Very impressive!
1932100660|5.0|Excellent read! This book came to me through one of the biggest consumer advocates in the philly area and it did not dissappoint!!! After reading a three part series last summer I didn't forget and ordered it for Christmas, for myself.

Now I've a whole new realm of foods and education, to teach myself how to eat again, with resounding successes, so far!
B0000028RR|5.0|Q: What does righteous anger sound like?<br /><br />A: Rage Against the Machine<br /><br />In a phenomenally powerful, aggressive, and thought provoking debut, Rage Against the Machine manage to immediately place themselves in the upper echelon of bands/artists who've used music as more than a way to make money.  While their career may not be so storied as others (Neil Young comes immediately to mind), their music is equally as important, in that it is the protest music of a new generation that grew up thinking of Vietnam and Watergate as distant memories.<br /><br />But, of course, good intentions only go so far.  The quality of the music is what carries the message, and the quality on this album is of the highest level.  While not the first band to combine the lyrical approach of rap with the instrumental approach of metal, Rage is the earliest prominent example of a band to do so across an entire album (rather than the one song approach of the Aerosmith/Run-D.M.C. and Anthrax/Public Enemy pairings), and years before other artists destroyed the genre by spawning nu-metal, which lacked the authenticity of either hardcore rap or metal.  As such, the songs on this album sounded brutally fresh when they hit the airwaves, and they still sound so today, as the intensity and honesty of this album hasn't yet been matched in the rap/metal genre.  There simply isn't a weak track on this album.  Not one.  Sure, some songs are more \\"famous\\" than the others, but this is a complete album, despite the presence of a few hits scattered throughout.  From front to back, it's filled with creative riffs, compelling lyrics and vocals, and a rhythm section that gives the music a lot of its character.<br /><br />Simply overwhelming!
0593055489|5.0|Atheist or theist...this book is for everyone. Atheists will be inspired, theists will be converted...or rather, deconverted as we are born as atheists. Gives you a reality check...to all theists - you need one!    One thing to consider. A lot of people call this \\"a personal attack on religion\\". On the contrary, Richard Dawkins uses science to backup  everything he says; something theists cannot do as science will disprove God in a jiffy.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|What a great movie! Little Miss Sunshine brings to light the quirks in everyday life that we all experience but seldomly reflect on. The characters remind us of people in our lives, people we've met, and people we hope we never meet. This movie is fantastic if, for no other reason, because it accurately conveys how truly bizarre and human nature is. Definitely the best movie of 2006.

B000YM4I4S|4.0|Riccardo Chailly is doing wonders with the Leipzig Gewandhaus, finding hidden potential and reserves of excitment in the orchestra. He earned much priase for a previous CD of the Schumann Sym. #2 and #4. There was the novelty of hering Mahler's revised version of the scores, even though the touches seem minimal to all but the most experienced listener. But the performances themselves felt sleek and updated. Now we have the other two symphonies, the \\"Spring\\" and the \\"Rhenish\\" to fill out the cycle.    The same style is applied to the new installments. I'd describe Chailly's approach as reserved nobility. He doesn't allow the music to run away with its own Romaantic frenzy the way Bernstein does, nor does he clip its wings so drastically as Szell. There's lots of full-blooded expression here, yet the contour of the music is very controlled. Fans of Chailly will recognize and appreciate this control; those of us who love a more unbuttoned Schumann will be less thrilled. But with such good sonics from Decca and the orchestra playing so well, this new cycle stands out as one of the best in recent years.
B000FC1KBG|5.0|This book is incredible! I've been trying to get my 3 month old to sleep and this was the only book that really helped me do it. Tracy is amazing and it makes me so sad that she's gone. I can't wait to read her other books and recommend this one to every mom I know.
0425188809|5.0|One of my favorite writers is Dean Koontz, and this is one of his (and mine) favorite novels. It is exceptional, and incorporates some of his main themes of love, courage, dedication, etc. If you're a dog lover, it's even better. Forget the atrocious films made from this material. The films were awful. The book is superb.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I had no clue what this show was about until around December when my buddy was talking about season 2 coming out. I had noticed the DVD set here on Amazon and immediatly added it to my Wishlist...mainly because of the cover of the box set. When my friend mentioned it, I asked him what it was about and then I became even more intrigued.<br /><br />Knowing I was heading to Iraq in January, I decided to wait on buying it until I got there. Now that I'm here, I ordered it as soon as I got internet access. In less than a week it showed and that following night when I got back to my tent I popped it in. The first episode got my attention right away. The Ice Truck killers victims and Dexter himself were so interesting.<br /><br />Michael C. Hall plays Dexter (who also played in 6 Feet Under) brilliantly. His acting is so dead on and so believable. I dont even see his character anymore from 6 Feet Under. Julie Benz who plays Rita, Dex's girlfriend, is also really great. And David Zayas who plays Angel is also really good. But that's about it. I'm not saying the others are bad, but they just dont seem believable. I cant stand Dex's sister, Debra Morgan played by Jeniffer Carpenter (she seems like she is forever imbedded in my head as Emily Rose) because I think she over reacts to everything. And she seems like she cusses to much (I'm no saint and I say the F word WAY to much) when it doesnt even need to be said. And it sounds like she's a really nice girl trying to cuss to be cool. I dont know. It bugs me. And Eric King's acting is also WAY over the top. He plays Doaks who is a forensic investigator that just doesnt like our boy Dex. I like the character a lot, but just not King who plays him. To me, the guy always looks like he's wanting to bust out laughing during his 'really mean and pissed off' parts. It drives me insane.<br /><br />Also the sound is not perfect sometimes. During a scene with a hockey arena...you can tell Dexter's lines are coming from him while on the ice. But the other 2 guys lines seem to have been recorded in a room somewhere else. Very annoying.<br /><br />I know I wrote a lot about some bad stuff, but this by NO MEANS, should hurt the rating I want to give Dexter. Michael C. Hall and the show itself should be rated over 5 stars with no question.<br /><br />Sadly I dont have Showtime, so I'm gonna have to wait for the DVDs as the seasons come out. Hopefully Dexter will last quite awhile. At least Showtime is producing some quality shows though (Weeds is another great one from them and I've heard good things about some of the others ones like Riches and Tudors.)<br /><br />One last thing, and it's not a spoiler at all. I loved how at the very end right before the credits, during the 'ticker tape parade', Dexters thoughts and his smiles and the peoples signs saying things were filmed. I was laughing pretty good at that last few seconds.ys lines seem to have been recorded in a room somewhere else. Very annoying.

B0006B2A42|3.0|This film was adopted from Alistair MacLean's novel of the same name, but the novel had the advantage in that it made sense. The film has some good scenes but is infected by Hollywood's view that the two super powers were morally equal. And although both Patrick McGoohan and Ernest Borgnine are fine actors, they are given some stupid lines. The character of Jim Brown isn't in the book (that I recall). I'd recommend the film despite its flaws but, since it's Hollywood, don't expect a logical plot. (Oh, and in the book, the good guys get the material, the Soviet lose. In the film, it's a draw)
B000ELJBAA|3.0|While this solo album of David Gilmour is a far cry from Pink Floyd's works and in some ways not as good, David makes this album with his voice and guitar-playing. It's good to hear David, the songs are \\"different\\", I must say, but listenable. I guess my feelings about this album are mixed, I think 3 stars is adequate for it. If you are a die-hard DG fan, you'll definately want this, this is not so much for the casual fan.
B00005JO20|1.0|By the time everyone gets to Skull Island you are bored. Jurassic Park showed us ground-breaking dinosaur CGI and we were scared by the dinosaurs.<br />Seeing a bloated Jack Black outrun a RAPTOR, while holding his hat onto his head, was more hokey than hokey. I was laughing at how the dinosaurs were flying by everyone (with less than an inch between them) in the stampede.<br />No one seemed at all \\"surprised\\" by the fact that they ended up on an island filled with prehistoric life.<br />The bug cavern scene was neat, which is why this gets 1 star.<br />Why would Adrian Brody's character go off on his own? Did the bugs decide to ignore him? No one wondered off on their own in Jurassic Park.
B000002U82|5.0|This Pink Floyd album is definitely a masterpiece and is certainly one of their very best albums. All of the songs are great and I love David Gilmour's voice and his guitar playing! It's always great to hear and is timeless, indeed. A must for anyone that wants explore the history of rock and prog-rock.
006135323X|5.0|I love this book!  It is quickly becoming one of my more frequent sources of quotes for coworkers.  I would put it at about #2 of all my favorite books on management and decision making right after [[ASIN:0470110120 How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of \\"Intangibles\\" in Business]] and just above [[ASIN:0812975219 Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets]] and [[ASIN:0743291255 The Halo Effect: ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers]].  Like How to Measure Anything, Predictably Irrational offers a fascinating list of sources of weirdness in human decisions, although I prefer the former for more practical advice. It covers odd errors we tend to make when interpreting uncertainty, risks, and choices of various types - especially purchasing decisions and prices.  Predictably irrational infuses doubt into our assumption that we \\"control\\" our choices but, since our irrationality is predictable, gives hope for improvement.  Now, I can't help but to think a bit more deeply about every purchase I make.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|This album is so good. I came across Sara while reading a magazine in a waiting room. At the end of the article, it said download \\"Love Song\\". So, when I got home, I listened to about 2 seconds of it, said \\"what the heck?\\" and bought it. Turns out, it was a GREAT song. Then, I decided to check out the rest of her album, and, turns out, \\"Love Song\\" wasn't the best on there!! The entire album is totally worth it.   She sounds a *little* like like Fiona Apple, I guess because of the sound of their voices, but other than that, their styles are *completely* different. (And I am a Fiona fan!!)  and now I'm a Sara Bareilles fan too! (that's ba-rell-is) :D

B00000FBRE|5.0|This is still one of my favorite albums (by lagwagon, or any album in general). I read somebody saying that \\"Blaze\\" was their best, no way buddy. That might be one of their worst, but yet..it's still good. All of Lagwagon's albums have yet to dissapoint me, but this album specifically is the most fun to listen to. Lagwagon along with The Get Up Kids are one of the most greatest underground bands to ever write music! RIP T.G.U.K.

This should have been a bonus CD and CD 1 should have been left the way it probably was originally. I don't want songs buried in QuickTime movies. For some strange reason, they don't want to play in my CD player. Pathetic.
B000002L9B|4.0|After Purple Rain broke Prince big, he made his first of many decisions that baffled fans and critics alike: he abandoned his signature funk-rock sound and put on a trippy sheen. This resulted in the \\"whimsical\\" personal displayed on Around the World in a Day. Then he filmed the infamous, widely panned vanity project Under the Cherry Moon (which I've never seen), and put this out as its soundtrack. It sure is a weird one - it opens with a good four part suite (\\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\\", \\"New Position\\", \\"I Wonder U\\", \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\") that has elements of jazz, R&B, psychedelia and experimental music, but not funk, and even the funky \\"Girls and Boys\\" has an endearingly eccentric arrangement, including a retro bari sax and a quacking keyboard. \\"Life Can Be So Nice\\" seems like a pop song, but it's oddly built on flute, ocarina and harpsichord. The loopy \\"Mountains\\" also has a lot of Prince's eccentricity, and it was one weird choice for a single. Sadly, there's also some soundtracky stuff, like the gloppy instrumental \\"Venus de Milo\\" and the flat-out incompetent \\"Do U Lie\\", with an awful accordion. But after that comes one of his best tunes, the enthusiastic no-bass funk of \\"Kiss\\", one of the few songs with Prince's infamous hypersexual lyrics and an awesome wah-wah guitar solo. And he keeps the hot streak up with the even funkier \\"Anotherloverholenyohead\\", with a really long title that rules (I like really long one word-titles that are pretty much a bunch of words sqgluiashed - yes, \\"sqgluiashed\\", I couldn't make up my mind between \\"squashed\\", \\"squished\\" and \\"glushed\\", so I just sqgluiashed the three words together), a fantastic piano hook, and slap bass. I love slap bass. It can make any song good all by itself. I bet that if even the Eagles made a song with a slap bass in it, it would be good just because of the slap bass. Then again, the Eagles have no sense of funk, because they have no sense of groove or sense of humor or sense of how to make even remotely worthwhile music. The Eagles aside, the album closes with one of Prince's loveliest acoustic ballads, \\"Sometimes it Snows in April\\", concerning death and the afterlife. There's a lot to like about this album, but it also marks the first time in Prince history when he didn't shake things up and put out an album that had nothing to do with what came before it. In short, this is Prince getting set in his ways, and you'll get the same mileage out of this as you will out of Around the World in a Day. But he would quickly get out of this semi-rut, forget about genre barriers entirely, and put out the double-album that everyone but me considers his defining artistic statement.ely worthwhile music.

B000002KYR|4.0|Hey, if you're gonna sell out, sell out in style. Don't just abandon your roots for the newest trend: make it sound cool. In other words, take cues from this album. Make no mistake about it: Eliminator is a pop record, and an '80s pop record at that. But here's what lifts it above most the rest of '80s pop: it's melodic, and the guitar playing is fantastic. The group was rewarded with four hits: the sleazy rockers \\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\\" and \\"Got Me Under Pressure\\", \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\", easily one of the coolest songs of the entire decade, and the group's signature tune, \\"Legs\\", with tremendous riffs. The enjoyable synth goof \\"TV Dinners\\" also made the radio a lot. The main star here is Billy Gibbons, who casually tosses off several awesome guitar solos as if it was easy. Now, if you don't like what he's doing then you should probably stay away from this record, since Dusty Hill gets pushed into the background by all the guitar overdubs and Frank Beard isn't doing anything more than keeping up a straight 4/4 beat. If Billy couldn't play, this would be a waste of a record, but he really, really can, giving \\"I Need You\\" a fascinating double-tracked solo. There's no variety here (other than the funky \\"Thug\\", which is bad other than the slap bass solos), but you have to remember it's ZZ Top we're talking about. The tunes are constantly enjoyable, both the big hits and album tracks (Dusty Hill's obvious but amusing innuendo tune \\"I Got the Six\\", with more Gibbons solos of ubercoolness), and there's so much hedonistic fun to be had here it doesn't matter, despite a couple of horny groaners (\\"Dirty Dog\\", \\"If Only I Could Flag Her Down\\", \\"Bad Girl\\"). It may not be ZZ's best album, but it's up there.

B000E6EJAC|5.0|1972 was a good year for David Bowie. Not only did he release his breakthrough album, Ziggy Stardust, he also produced this, Mott the Hoople's breakthrough effort. The album's Bowie-penned, beyond-catchy title track, perhaps the best song of the entire glam movement, became a major hit and a subsequent gay anthem. It really does have that contemporary Bowie sound, with the lyrics, the heavy guitars, and the campy vocals. Of course, there's no denying the arrangement is drop-dead gorgeous, but the real selling point is the lyrics, a mix of tenderness and humor. Of course, there's more to it than just one big hit. They also do a first-rate cover of Lou Reed's \\"Sweet Jane\\", sped up and augmented by a guitar solo; pump out thundering, raunchy glam rock like \\"Mama's Little Jewel\\", \\"Jerkin' Crocus\\" (with an amusingly weird synthesizer) and \\"One of the Boys\\", successfully experiment with folk-glam on \\"Sucker\\" (with a prominent mandolin in the instrumental break contrasting the laid-back riffage of the verse and sax-dominated chorus). Every solo Mick Ralphs whips out of his guitar is highly creative - you have to wonder how they let this guy get away. Plus there's Verden Allen's bizarre \\"Soft Ground\\", with weird vocal overdubs, skating-rink organ, and all kinds of production gimmicks - it sounds great, too. And the two part \\"Ready for Love\\" rides one of their heaviest riffs, with jazzy embellishments like an organ, before morphing into a psychedelic Latin guitar solo, which I assume is \\"After Lights\\". The one track I can't stand is \\"Sea Diver\\", which starts off as a great piano ballad... and then the orchestra kicks in. Other than that, it's an energetic, campy release with sledgehammer riffs and humor to spare. What more does a glam classic need?

B000WSL5Y0|4.0|\\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is a well-crafted piece of cinema which does credit to the directorial talent of Ben Affleck.  I will be the first to say I was surprised at the deftness with which he orchestrated the entire cast.    I was, however, unable to make out what Casey Affleck, Ben's brother in the lead role of Patrick Kenzie, was saying 80% of the time.  I had to give up and use the subtitles after the first twenty minutes passed.  His massacred vocal intonations sounded like they were coming from underwater--and from an oral cavity stuffed with several dozen ball bearings.      Still, despite his inconveniently inarticulate manner of talking, Kenzie's character was well-drawn overall.  One could easily believe this \\"old soul\\" in a young body was actually committed to behaving honorably and nobly in a plotline jammed with deceitful and dishonest individuals.  However, I am certain that in \\"real\\" life he would have been stabbed, shot, pushed into a quarry gorge, run over, and/or (at the very least) pistol-whipped by any number of the low-lifes Kenzie encountered in the course of the plot.  But the canny Mr. Kenzie slips past them all with only a brief interlude of actual mano-a-mano action (and of course he strides away from it, utterly unscathed and gloriously vindicated).    Michelle Monaghan's Angie Gennaro was banal and insipid.  Whining early on that she \\"didn't want to find a dead little girl's body\\" struck a particularly incongruous note--she and her boyfriend/business partner were investigating A KIDNAPPING.  It would have been highly unlikely they were going to locate Amanda hosting a covert tea party in a local park with several of her favorite dolls.  And the very end of the film--when Patrick has to make what can only be described as a monstrously difficult moral decision--her words of \\"support\\" are \\"If you do this I will hate you\\".      Fun.  Her entire presence in this movie was completely unnecessary.  Or perhaps if an actress with more potential had playedthe role, she wouldn't have come across as so completely unlikeable and bothersome.  And what was up with the feathered Farrah Fawcett hair Angie was sporting?  This wasn't a period piece set in 1982...    The REAL breakaway talent of \\"Gone\\" was Amy Ryan, who took on the role of Helene McCready, mother of the missing girl. Helene is a trashy, self-centered, drug-addled disaster, and Amy plays the role with a brilliant honesty which has the viewer alternately loathing her severe deficiencies as a mother and a human being in general and simply pitying her self-destructive lifestyle.  Her performance is nothing short of Oscar-worthy!
B00023B1LC|5.0|This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I never thought of Matt Damon as an \\"action hero\\" type until I saw this movie.  It just keeps getting better with the sequels.
B00004SZWB|3.0|This is not the album to buy if you're wanting to have only one SW recording.  Good, but not up to the standards of his other works.  Do any of the selections seem to have stood the test of time?  If so, which one?
B00005JNEI|1.0|...and to paraphrase this comedian's live act \\"'Fahrenheit 9/11' now there's a movie that has people up in arms. Michael Moore could be narrating \\"On September 10th, George Bush took a sip of water\\" (audience reaction) oh f**k\\"    That is the feeling I got throughout this film as Moore narrated.  While I enjoy his films and the persona he shows in them, he may never make a film as bad as this one. He seems to be conspicuously absent on the screen for much of the time and that makes his narration feel intrusive, as if he's trying to distance himself from the material in any small way he can so he doesn't seem too mean spirited and instead give off an aura of truthfulness.  While some of the things he says in this film are eye opening to the casual observer a number of the conclusions that Moore comes to are rash and speculative (which I don't mind, since he does this all the time) which makes most of his films entertaining, if not insightful, but this film is missing a true humor about itself because it was intended for a specific political purpose (with effects expected) in mind. To me, art never works that way since people often see the art much later than the intended effects, such is the case with me. Apart from the controversy, this film just doesn't entertain, or inform us. Moore wants to call Bush a criminal, but never does (for libel reasons, no doubt) so he just implies it. That's the problem with this documentary, it seems to pull the most obvious of punches when that's the reason for its existence, to knock out the opposition.  When you repress the execution of the major point for any reason, the result is going to come out badly, but that doesn't mean it isn't funny, it just isn't very good, or lasting.
B00006AW2O|5.0|[[VIDEOID:aca628aac7775f19bd5821aecbedc242]] Went back and listened to all the songs. Love that old sound even more now.

But regardless, the old Stones music is even better for listening to now than it was when it was released because you don't hear it every 20 minutes.
B000002GB9|5.0|The bottom line here is this:  For the non-hardcore Styx fan, all you need from Styx is the Grand Illusion and their greatest hits.  That way you have their definitive work, along with \\"all those other songs you like\\".  Why?  Because this was Styx's near flawless album.  The songwriting is very strong throughout with no filler tunes (the only Styx album that is true for).  This caught Styx in 1977 for Tommy Shaw's second album with the band.  This was when they were still mainly a hard-rock outfit.  Following this album, Styx songwriting started falling off noticably.  Then (much worse) Dennis DeYoung took more control of the band and pulled them into a much more pop territory.  That was then topped off by the Kilroy fiasco that killed the band.  Get this album and their greatest hits.  It is all you need.
B000YAFJYS|4.0|It's hard not to like the dark, adults-only French animated film that is contesting Ratatouille's Oscar win this year. The animation itself is two dimensional and black and white to represent the inevitable gloominess of the storyline. The writing is superb, detailed, and thought-provoking. But don't expect to feel good about yourself or the world after watching this film.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|I don't know whether the crime film is actually dead or dying as some would say to movies like American Gangster or We Own the Night (which is more cliche in its black and white storyline)but truthfully I found American Gangster to be an absolutely fascinating film...mostly. If you've been living under a rock or haven't been reading a single thing on this product page the movie details the rise of Frank Lucas a harlem gangster who rose from being the driver/confidante of deceased gangster Bumpy Johnson to being one of the top crime leaders in New York City in the seventies. The film details the exact method of his rise where in he sees a report on drug use in Vietnam and flies there to secure a distribution from the Golden Triangle around Thailand paying off US army brass to import the heroin in caskets of dead soldiers. On the opposite end of this spectrum is officer Richie Roberts who after the death of a troubled partner from Heroin called Blue Magic and an appointment to lead a special investigation begins slowly to seek out the source of the drugs. Thats the story in a nutshell I suppose as the film takes a route I've always liked in being very procedural in the details from Lucas' operation and problems dealing with crooked cops to troubled family members to Richie's problems with crooked cops, the fact that he found a load of money which earned him ire when he turned it in to the fact that a criminal is godfather to his son and he won't take a bribe. The acting is great all around with a lot of great supporting work and Ridley Scott in that way Ridley Scott can makes everything from the bell bottoms and afros to the cars look cool. If anything brought the production down to me I'd have to fault two things. One is extraneous story in a nearly three hour film. While I won't fault all of the things in the Lucas storyline the Roberts plot has a storyline involving trouble with his wife who is moving away and taking her son because of him and the hard lifestyle helives. Sure it shows Roberts work affecting his homelife but its cliche and not really needed. Also theres a sharp tonal shift at the end of the film that I found rather weird as Frank who's been shown as an absolutely ruthless crime lord changes into somewhat a kind of a hero when he helps Roberts crackdown on police corruption. Two hours twenty minutes seeing him shoot beat and cause the death of people then ten minutes later He's not such a bad guy. Features on the DVD detail all the work Lucas did to help Roberts in obtaining this and the fact that both became great friends afterward. Still to me it felt odd to the film although it ends the storyline of the crooked police officers better than a subscript as the movie rolls on credits.  So thats what I think of the film so hows the DVD. As usual pretty good and worth the money for fans of the film. Theres a two disc unrated version and three disc collectors edition. I bought the two disc version as the three disc has mostly a booklet and extraneous docs about hip-hop influence, a Dateline report on the movie, a music video and the films trailer. The two disc of course has more material on the movie which was enough for me with commentary from Scott who's always detailed in his commentaries enough to be fascinating to listen to. The unrated material is a little extraneous with most of it coming at the end where Lucas is released after his fifteen year stay in prison. Thankfully this isn't unrated extended only and you're given the option of watching the either the extended or theatrical version of the film. On disc two theres also featurettes on production of certain scenes, deleted scenes and always my favorite with movies detailing a point of history a featurette with interviews from the real men the actors portray and their thoughts on the story and how they're reflected in the movie. The two disc in my opinion is a complete package for those wanting to know about the movie but hey if your a fan of the film gofor the three disc. Everything is good in my opinion.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I had seen this movie at the theater without watching the TC series.  Now that I have finally watched the TC series and gone back to watch the movie I am very impressed with the movie.<br /><br />The movie stays true to the series and neatly wraps up the numerous loose ends the series had.  It still feels like some of the plot elements were wrapped up in a hurry, and I am sure they were.<br /><br />Still this was a very satisfying end, to an otherwise open-ended series.  I especially like watching the Outtakes.
B000YPUF9W|3.0|Which just about sums up this film.  No, this is not one for an intellectual evening in with a glass of wine, a light Italian evening meal and the better half for company.  This is a fast paced action film that does not require the use of brain cells.  Not saying this is a bad thing, not at all.  The special effects are first class, the body count is high and the ending is fairly predictable.<br /><br />Story in brief, virus turned the worlds population (and its animal life) into zombies, small crew of survivors travel about Mad Max style looking for fellow survivors while our heroine wanders about with even less of a purpose than he new travelling companions while the bad guys hold up in a bunker dabbling in science in ways they really shouldn't.<br /><br />The film is pretty predictable from start to finish even to the extent you know who is going to die next.  The film is nothing special and you have almost certainly seen it all before.<br /><br />For a couple of hours its fun.  Instantly forgettable and you probably wont want to watch it again but for a one off, not a bad film at all.

1933492279|3.0|We've entered a little pause in the parade of space opera and related films.  Those films have created another market for people who only watch them in order to see lavish production designs.  For you who've bought various \\"Art of ...\\" books, \\"Cosmic Motors\\" is your kind of material.  The photo-realistic, computer-enhanced designs in that book are nice, but they aren't as memorable as the best entries in the genre.  The shapes that these elaborate textures are built upon are too simple; design-school graduates need to avoid the pitfall of oversimplifying the shapes that their textures will cover.  This is like serving a dry cake with great frosting.  Make sure that the basic forms flow nicely and look right, before you texture them, O.K. designers?

This is a great introduction into his life and writing ability and many sayings and phrases Churchill is known for are given in this volume. Few, if any, are willing to risk potential embarrassment by stating as one of their life's accomplishments any book that they have read. However, if one is able to add having read this book among those achievements then at least that part of their life will not have been wasted.
B000XA5K48|4.0|I can't say it any better than what's already been said.  I'll just add that this movie is a real HOOT.  However, I must refute those who say it doesn't have a plot, cuz it surly does.  It's as unbelievable as must of the stunts, but it's there if you can see it through the non-stop action.  I may not have it exact right; it's been a few weeks since I saw this film, but... (SPOILER) It's basically about the last surviving baby from a baby mill whose existence is solely to serve as transplant material to save a wealth and (soon to be) powerful politician.  Then there's the evil gun manufacturer and his hired guns (Giamatti & Co.) who are trying to see that this doesn't happen because of the politician's gun control policy.  And poor Clive is caught in the middle with the smoking hot wet-nurse/prostitute (Bellucci).  Luckily, Owen pretty good with guns and lethal vegetables.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Thom Yorke and co. have been making an incessant buzz ever since early October of last year when the world damn near stopped turning at the announcement of their forthcoming album, \\"In Rainbows.\\"  It was all there: the \\"return to form\\" comparisons with \\"OK Computer\\".....the \\"screw the record industry\\" web site release style.....the rumors of a love song.<br /><br />Admittedly, in the frenzy of it all, I somehow missed the memo about an eventual CD release in early 2008.  On October 10, I happily logged onto Radiohead's website, did my little currency conversion, and proudly clicked \\"submit order\\" on what I thought was $9 well spent on a band whose innovation and creativity was worth what I would not receive in stellar sound quality and abstract liner notes.  So when the fog finally lifted and I realized that 128 kbps sound and a Staples CD-R would not be my only means of enjoying this album (and it is indulgently enjoyable), I made a conscious decision to stick to the original intentions of the band.  I would not spend $12 more for a hard copy.  It was an Internet-only release, and I was hell bent on absorbing it that way.<br /><br />Not that it really matters.  \\"In Rainbows\\" is too good with or without fancy accessorizing.  But make no mistake: there is little original material here.  Some of it harkens back to the \\"Bends\\" days, while other tracks preserve the glitch-happy moments of \\"Kid A.\\"  More likely though, what you'll hear is a hybrid of the band's 15 year catalogue.  And ultimately, isn't that what we want?  Not a band trying to reinvent the wheel, but rather some reliably (if not expected) outstanding tunes from one of popular music's saving graces?<br /><br />On the whole, \\"In Rainbows\\" is mellow.  Get past the first two tracks of \\"15 Step\\" and \\"Bodysnatchers\\", and you'll find the band at their ethereal and atmospheric best.  A Thom Yorke coo on \\"Nude\\" sends shivers up the spine.  The dark synth textures on \\"All I Want\\" are captivating.  The cheeky love lines of \\"House Of Cards\\" are a welcome reprieve from the usual sturm und drang lyrical themes.  And \\"Videotape\\" will freak the hell out of you, if you'll let it.<br /><br />Rogue release tactics and clumsy packaging aside, all you really need are the 10 songs anyhow.  If you like Radiohead in the least, you will like this album, and it deserves your hard earned cash, one way or the other.  You'll listen at least a dozen times through the album before the trance even begins to lift anyhow.s\\" are a welcome reprieve from the usual sturm und drang lyrical themes.

B001041JLE|4.0|Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Michael Jackson who without question is the greatest performer of all time. The remastered and the new remixed versions are great. I do agree with other reviewers that the DVD should have been remastered particularly in high definition.  The other issue I have with the DVD is that while the Motown performance was great I do not think it was all that. His greatest performance, for those old enough to remember, was at another award show where he sings I believe The Man in the Mirror. He starts out singing then is backed up by a full gospel choir. He gets so into the song that a man comes from off stage to check on Michael. It was so intense I remember being brought close to tears.When I saw it I wished then I recorded it; that to me was his greatest live performance because of the emotion and soul he put into singing it.   Overall it is an excellent release and well worth the money.

B0000931QA|5.0|I won't write a lot here because all the reviews speak for themselves.  I first heard this album in 1989 as a kid and was floored by how good it was.  Every time I listen to it these days, I'm still floored by how good it is.    It's a fact and not my opinion that this album is the standard bearer against which most subsequent progressive rock was judged.  The progressive rock circles & press all hail this album as THE benchmark where greats like Dream Theater and Symphony X found inspiration, and they say as much themselves.  And the best part about the album, as I said, is that not only was it the standard bearer - but it continues to be.  Prog may have changed some over the years, but the timelessness of this album and its amazing riffs & tunes, poignant story line, and breathtaking innovation still leave a mark on listeners today.      This album will be inspiring new prog rock enthusiasts for a long time to come, and they will be giving it 5 stars too.

B000FZERIG|5.0|Yes, George Harrison's ultimate example of emotional songwriting genius is on All Things Must Pass.  We all know that.  But to be totally honest this album really isn't a step down.      People keep telling me All Things Must Pass is the only George Harrison album I need, and I simply refuse to believe that's true when the man was capable of writing emotionally soothing and melodic songs all throughout his career.      Living in the Material World is another fantastic album by a great musician.  Really, give the album a chance.  You'll find yourself enjoying the vocal melodies and falling in love with George Harrison's gentle voice and caring lyrics.  Just because this album isn't his very best album doesn't mean it's not worth listening to.  That's just not true.  Come on.  Give this album a chance.      Imagine if we all said Led Zeppelin's fourth album was the only album worth listening to because it's the best album they ever made.  We'd be ignoring other classic albums in the process.  That's why I can't agree with people who think All Things Must Pass is the only George Harrison album worth owning.  When you like a bands style, you enjoy much more than just the classic stuff.  That's the truth.
080701429X|5.0|This small volume is a priceless addition to any collection of humanitarian ideas. Its subtext makes several interrelated existential points about human suffering and human meaning; points that only those who have known extreme suffering could make with the kind of conviction and eloquence that Dr. Frankel has made here: That while pain and suffering may be relative, even \\"chosen,\\" the infliction of gratuitous cruelty -- insults, indignities and debasement are absolutes, and is an unforgivable but universal currency applied by all totalitarian systems.<br /><br />Social and political tyrannies, whether soft or hard, are just opposite sides of the same coin of cultural and existential emptiness. They begin first by destroying the most precious of freedoms, the freedom of thought: effectively creating a \\"concentration camp of the mind\\" through social stratification, willful (or benign) neglect, obscene discrepancies in wealth and wellbeing, and by twisted race-based ideologies and other forms of \\"groupthink\\" consensus-based political and social orthodoxies. Then come the politics of exclusion, followed by social death - ghettoes and segregation; and then the final stop: unjust physical imprisonment and eventually removal to concentration camps. It is a gradient that leads progressively to walls of hopelessness and despair and that at each step of the way is every bit as cruel in their cumulative emotional and psychological effects as the electrified fences that enclosed the prisoners of Auschwitz.<br /><br />The existential challenge for the sufferer has been put best by Professor Cornel West of Princeton University, who as a self-described \\"Chekhovian Christian\\" sees the challenge as follows: \\"... Being a Chekhovian Christian is refusing to be imprisoned and walled-in by intentionally inflicted misery. It is to wake up each day with a new strategy for survival.\\"<br /><br />That is exactly what Dr. Frankel did in repeatedly facing-down certain death at the hands of the Nazi war-machine. This book and the Logo-therapy that it gave rise to are fitting living tributes to all of those who died in the European holocaust.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I am hooked on Dex.  I used to be a huge Weeds fan, but the 3rd season was sort of a letdown. I had seen the ads for Dexter, but never really checked it out. I saw Season 1 at a good price on Itunes, and downloaded it. Watched the entire season on an extremely slow work day (wink wink). Then, this past weekend, while I was sick as a dog, I watched all of S2.  Talk about clever, engaging writing.  The humor is dark, but the show also has laugh out loud moments.    Dexter is a serial killer who kills serial killers. He watched his mother get executed and that left a void in him.  He's been drawn to blood ever since and his adoptive father, Harry, decides to \\"help\\" Dexter channel his addiction (?).  I say \\"help\\" b/c as the seasons (1-2) progress, Dexter learns things about himself, his family, and his beloved adoptive dad that shake up everything he's always believed.  Harry taught him The Code, and by this code, Dex chooses his victims.    Dexter is said to be void of any feelings, but I personally believe that's not the case. This is based on the relationships he has w/his sister Deb (Jen C) and his girlfriend Rita (Julie B) and her two kids.  These relationships balance Dexter out, and make him out to be something other than the total monster he believes himself to be.    The acting is fabulous. From the lead, Michael C. Hall (AMAZING) to the supporting cast.  Julie Benz, who I first saw as Darla on Buffy, plays a completely different type of character as Rita the recovering domestic violence victim w/two young kids. She is introduced to us as someone who provides Dexter w/a cover, or an appearance of normalcy (read: non-serial killer), but watch the episodes for yourself to determine if that's all there is.      His relationship w/his sister Deb is also fun to watch as well as those who work in homicide...Particularly Sgt JAMES DOAKES! (nod to a season two moment LOL).  Dexter's interactions with all of the supporting cast members are interesting to watch b/c he considers himself to be going through the motions of attempting to fit in, so lots of what he says and does reflect how he THINKS he should respond in social situations. Makes for comedy as well as insight into Dexter.    And also, I wanted to add, that even though this is a cable show, it's not over the top. As a CSI lover, I've seen just as much blood and gore there  The show is a great ride and you won't be disappointed. Now if Showtime would only release SEASON TWO!!!
0393327655|4.0|Sam Harris' book is a sobering and well-written discussion which basically outlines the evils that have been committed historically by religious people, and sets forth the threat that religion poses to our modern world.  My copy of the book is heavily underlined and highlighted, and contains my hand-written comments, both in the text and in the extensive footnotes.  I found myself saying \\"Yes!\\" frequently while reading it.  The text is amazingly literate (although occasionally obtuse), but horrifying at the same time.  I agree with Mr. Harris on almost every point he makes with regard to the ignorance, intolerance and even pure hatred that is fostered within the religions of this world.  Harris makes the point that we should love one another, not because we fear the wrath of some god, but because we simply should get along, for the sake of our own survival.  His arguments can sometimes be lost in philosophical discussions regarding perception, mysticism and the like, but the bottom line is clear.  Although he is sharp in his criticism of both the extremists and the moderates alike, he calls for us all to work together to save ourselves.  He does not think this is possible as long as we hold onto our religious beliefs, which by their nature make us enemies of one another.  He effectively makes the point that, no matter what faith you adhere to, if you are true to the tenets of that faith, you MUST believe that all non-believers are doomed, and that no religion accepts acceptance, even moderate, of any other tenets.  He firmly believes that, unless we make an end to faith, we are doomed to destroy ourselves.  This, more than anything else, makes this book a sobering and frightening piece of work. I did get a little bogged down at the end, when he goes off into a discussion of meditation and mysticism apart from religion, but I believe that what he wanted to say was thatwe can find ways to achieve inner peace that don't require a belief in a supreme being that has control over us.  I think that Mr. Harris wants us to assume responsibility for our own peace, both within and without.  A fine piece of work, even with its weaknesses.  A brave and thought-provoking effort on behalf of reason in a world gone mad.rol over us.  I think that Mr. Harris wants us to assume responsibility for our own peace, both within and without.

B00001OH7N|5.0|The Man Who Sold the World is supposed to be David Bowie's \\"heavy metal\\" album.  Well, I wouldn't go THAT far (it's no Black Sabbath or Metallica after all) but it's certainly one of Bowie's more rocking efforts.    The quality of the songwriting is *just* as strong as it was on Space Oddity (though I've talked to others who offer strong disagreement with me there- to each his own).  This time, we have Bowie heading in a different direction with lots of energetic guitar playing, and this is the album where most people consider Bowie's career to have really begun (something I don't quite agree with due to the Space Oddity album being consistently great despite never settling into a distinct theme and being somewhat all over the place, but whatever).    \\"The Width of a Circle\\" is a multi-part guitar-dominated track, with some of Bowie's best vocal melodies ever laid down on tape.  Call me crazy but the guitar playing that opens the song (and occasionally repeats throughout) sounds a lot like \\"This land is your land, this land is my land\\".  I know, I'm a weird one!  After some frantic guitar playing, the second half of the song kicks in, with some chilly and spooky psychedelic-influenced Bowie screaming (a VERY distinct and enjoyable style of his vocal skills).  Rather bizarrely, the tone switches into a completely different direction/style towards the end of the song with an equally-fascinating vocal melody- now the song turns into a chugging playful boogie of some kind not much different from the stuff you'd hear on a Paul McCartney & Wings album.  This is probably the best song on the album.    I never would've guessed just by listening to this album, but reading reviews online suggest the main theme is about being trapped in a mental institution and the emotional agony that follows.  Well with that in mind, listening contently to the lyrics to \\"All the Madmen\\" now makes the song sound significantly more tragic.  This song seems sort of melancholy just by listeningto the vocal melody and David's voice, but a closer inspection reveals utter heartache being stuck in a hopeless situation in between the walls of a madhouse with no one from the outside to hear your cries.  This song also wouldn't be out of place somewhere on Bowie's The Rise & Fall of Ziggy Stardust album, something I didn't realize when I first heard it 14 years ago.  My original impression of \\"All the Madmen\\" is that it's a nice and somewhat aimless tune that could be placed in the same category as a really early late 60's Peter Hammill/Van Der Graaf Generator folk meets rock type of song.  I feel differently now that I took the time to pay closer attention to the lyrics.    Many people know the title song despite it hardly ever played on the radio anymore due to the more popular Nirvana cover version played more frequently instead.  I think Bowie's version is clearly better since it has more charisma with Bowie's vocal spookiness being the most enjoyable aspect.  Nirvana's version is only so popular because of how normal and easy-flowing it sounds making it suitable for radio listeners, in addition to Kurt Cobain's well-known friendship with Bowie.    \\"Saviour Machine\\" has a jazzy intro that sounds very similar to the Sugarloaf song \\"Things Gonna Change Some\\" (which I believe Sugarloaf borrowed from another song) and I believe Elton John copied that middle section for the introduction to his famous hit \\"Funeral for a Friend/Loves Lies Bleeding\\" (after the spooky wind blowing sound effects and bells, I mean).  With that in mind, I absolutely LOVE \\"Saviour Machine!\\"  With a category as big as Bowie's it's hard to make a top ten list, but this song HAS to be near the top.  The Beatles-like vocal melody (think somewhere on the Sgt. Peppers album) and tempo changes hit the spot for me, and Bowie's vocal range was never better presented.  This song's awesome!    \\"Black Country Rock\\" is an innocent little hard rocker.  Actually if most official hard rock bands wrote asong like this, I'd be saying it's a clear highlight.  The vocal melody is quite stellar, and there's even a Marc Bolan (of T.Rex fame) vocal similarities every so often.  Love the guitar riffs too.  \\"She Shook Me Cold\\" is alarmingly ugly!  It's almost like the melody or rhythm is completely off or just plain sloppy, but at least the guitar playing and thumpy bass work in the second half makes up for it (and sounds like Amon Duul II too!)  I don't even know what to think about this song to be honest.  I guess its unusual nature has its charm.    \\"After All\\" has the same kind of creepiness and fascinating tempo changes as \\"Saviour Machine\\" with a tone reminiscent of a sad scene in an old fashioned Disney movie.  The instrumental part in the middle makes me think of someone unable to perform in a circus and you can see him walking around outside a tent with the rain pouring down around him.  Yeah my vivid imagination- there's no explanation for it!  I'm totally not trying to criticize this song by comparing it to a Disney movie I hope all of you understand!  I prefer letting my imagination do the talking sometimes.    \\"Running Gun Blues\\" is actually normal!  It's somewhat in between theatrical and folk-ish (make that *heavy* folk-ish!)  He sings a certain way a few times in this track that reminds me of a popular early Pearl Jam song.  Probably coincidental.  Love the chorus joining in at the end too- makes it sound heavenly.  \\"The Supermen\\" has one of the coolest intros ever!  An uplifting and inspirational vocal soar with bouncy bass work all over it.  This part actually appears all over the song since I'm having trouble listening through Bowie's heavy accent and his Davy Jones of the Monkees resembling voice work.  I wouldn't have the slightest clue what the lyrics are about though.    The dirty production elevates the music of this album even further in my opinion, which is always a positive thing in my book.  There's too many clean-sounding albums out there, andhonestly, I miss the dirt!  This album is truly a classic.
B00005JL0I|5.0|`Casino Royale', the original 1960's version is one of those movies which seems to improve with age. I can recall reviews at the time of its release saying that its primary failing was that it parodied a genre, the James Bond movies, which were themselves a parody of the spy thriller genre, so it was much like taking coals to Newcastle. The movie was done with much of the same talent which contributed to the similar `What's New Pussycat', primarily the superb comic talents of Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. One of the very best things I can say about `Casino Royale' is that where these two failed to redeem `What's New Pussycat', they succeeded quite well thank you in the spy spoof.<br />One of the things one notices upon looking back at this flick is that it may have been an unsung precursor to the general genre of `all star' spoof movie. Most of this genre has usually been traced back to `Airplane', `Blazing Saddles', and maybe the early Woody Allen movies such as `What's New, Tiger Lily' and `Take the Money and Run'. In fact, I think Casino Royal stands up quite well as one of the better early representatives of this genre.<br />One thing this has in spades is a fine collection of cameo and major performances by the likes of David Niven, Orson Welles, George Raft, William Holden, Deborah Kerr, John Huston and many others. And, each one contributes just the right amount of panache to their stereotypical characters. But Sellers, Niven, and Allen do most of the heavy lifting, with Sellers doing a superb job in his character, far, far better than his silly character in `Pussycat'.<br />I also am very fond of the inventiveness behind some of the silliness, although there is more than enough simple-minded silliness, especially in the final scene. The primary premise of five James Bond characters, flubbing their roles in the field, leading to the need to bring James Bond senior out of retirement to straighten things out creates lots of opportunities for a wide variety of situations and subplots.<br />While the new `Casino Royale' is a superb `classic' Bond flick, its release may have the secondary benefit of bringing this old warhorse spoof out of the closet to be enjoyed once more.nd subplots.

B000VL9XE2|4.0|I think that this album is great.  But I like The Dillinger Escape Plan because they're creative and precise, not because they're \\"metal.\\"  Ire Works is not as intense as, say, Miss Machine, and even its best moments don't quite reach the speed or complexity of older DEP albums.<br /><br />A good way to quantify this is: if I had just picked up Ire Works without knowing anything about DEP, I would think that it's insane and really neat.  The controversial \\"Black Bubblegum,\\" a quite poppy (yet still dark and interesting) song, would feel right at home on this album.  But DEP fans expected DEP to get faster and harder with Ire Works, which isn't quite what happened, and that's why it's getting some negative reviews.<br /><br />One thing I don't like about this album is the relatively heavy use of electronics.  They don't overpower any of the music, but there are little synthesized noises all over the place that just seem unnecessary.  I have also read that the album has too much \\"filler,\\" but I look at the song \\"When Acting as a Particle\\" as just over a minute of abstract instrumental awesomeness.  The rest of the non-music on this album feels appropriate for building suspense.<br /><br />Admittedly, Gil Sharone (of Stolen Babies) is not as gifted of a drummer as Chris Pennie, and DEP fans will never understand why Pennie left DEP for Coheed & Cambria.  Sharone does fit the bill, especially on this simpler album, but there is a lack of those \\"Holy cow!  What in the world is he playing?\\" moments that Pennie gave us.<br /><br />As an appreciator of good and interesting music, I again say that this is a great album.  It is not as fast, heavy, or complex as any of DEP's past albums, but it is good in its own way.  If nothing else, I hope that this album is recognized as being a hundred times better than Between The Buried & Me's \\"Colors.\\"
B000001FEW|5.0|Never a Dull Moment's only problem is that it's too short of an album.  Rod Stewart was really pumping out quality songs at this point in his career, and he knew it, which is why this album has become a classic over the years.  \\"You Wear It Well\\" is NOT the same thing as \\"Maggie May\\", haha.  Some people think the two songs sound the same, and I agree to an extent.  The vocal melodies sure sound similar.    His cover of \\"Angel\\" is pretty fantastic, but there's only ONE Jimi Hendrix, baby.  The emotions are probably just as strong in this version though.  You can tell in the way Rod *really* means it when he sings that vocal melody.    \\"True Blue\\" is another great track that many people might recognize... maybe not.  I don't know what Rod Stewart songs are played on the radio these days.  I highly doubt radio stations these days are willing to go far back in time and dig up some forgotten favorites, but who knows.    I really love Rod's version of \\"Twistin' the Night Away\\".  There's only one Rod Stewart, because no one else I've ever heard even comes CLOSE to having that same kind of pleasant hoarse voice.  He really takes this song to a new level of excitement.  It no longer sounds like a party song- Rod turned it into a very pretty track.      A must own for Rod Stewart fans.
B000Y11BAS|3.0|This edition includes the two movies on two separate discs and \\"Evita\\" is still the exact same disc everyone has been overstocked with and can buy 50 copies for $10 each at Virgin.  I bought this edition just assuming \\"Evita\\" would finally be formatted and watchable on a 16 by 9 tv and I don't know if I'm entitled to a refund or not so right now I'm out $18 and this distributor needs to stop being so lazy repackaging DVDs printed 10 years ago and not even watchable on a modern tv especially considering the quality of the film.  So \\"The Wiz,\\" \\"Titanic\\" and soon \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\" are finally in anamorphic but this movie's still dragging behind with cinemascope-within-4:3 output that looks terrible on wide panels yet the movie is apparently good enough that it was one of the first to be released on DVD 10 years ago.  I don't care about bonus features just somebody please release this movie formatted.  Having said all this, it's a magnificent film.  I have not seen \\"Frida.\\"

I recommend getting the normal version, which is an awesome movie.

0553381687|4.0|A Song of Ice and Fire is a wickedly-entertaining fantasy series from George R.R. Martin.  A Game of Thrones is the first book in the series.  We are introduced to the land of Westeros and the principal Houses that rule the land.<br /><br />This fantasy series is organized and narrated differently from most of other books you might have read.  Basically, all of the story is told from character POVs.  Now, ofcourse, that is basically how all stories are told, however, this book is specifically arranged and the chapters are so named with that idea in mind.<br /><br />I am also a big fan of Jordan's The Wheel of Time series.  If you like WoT, I suspect you will also like A Song of Ice and Fire series.  However, please keep in mind that Martin writes for a more mature audience than Jordan does.  In Martin's series, good and evil are not clear-cut black and white.  And themes of betrayal, incest, brutality, and violence are ever-present on every page.  Martin's book delves more into politics and human relations than does Jordan.  However, I believe Jordan has more of the \\"fantasy\\" elements in his series.  I prefer Jordan as a story-teller.  He is the more inventive of the two.  However, A Game of Thrones is far from being bland.  It's just as enthralling and captivating as The Wheel of Time.  Just bear in mind that it is not suited for young audiences.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones starts off slow at first.  The pace crawls at the start.  However, the pace will pick up as soon as the major players are introduced.  And just like any other novel, some chapters will captivate your interest, while some will not.
B000ASDFJU|4.0|First off, the packaging is gorgeous! The bright velvety pink book format is unique and ingenious. I love that it comes with a hard plastic case to keep it protected. As I said, it is in book format, which takes you page by page through the 6 seasons of the show. The layout is nice.<br /><br />What I wish they would have done was redesigned the dvds. If you buy the show season by season, the dvds have the main menu, then (I'm going on memory so bear with me!) the next menu has the episodes that are on that particular dvd. Once you select an episode, it takes you to yet another menu where you can preview/play the episode. It drives me nuts! So when I got this, I hoped there was an option to play all episodes, that way you don't have to hit 450 buttons to watch the dvd. I think they could have eliminated at least 1 or 2 of the extra menus.  This is the reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5.<br /><br />Another thing I wish they would have changed would have been the talking on the menus. You know how if you leave a dvd on it's menu the music will play over and over again? Well, this has lines from each show, playing over and over and over. It's just a small annoyance. Thankfully there's a mute button for those times when you're not quite ready to start the show.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great buy for the die hard Sex fans out there. I was lucky enough to receive it as a gift and I love it! If you love the show, it really pays to own the dvds. The reruns that are editted on tv are just not the same.
0385522401|3.0|From the first page of \\"On Chesil Beach,\\" we find ourselves caught in the sexual tension of newlyweds Edward and Florence, in their honeymoon suite, hours after the wedding--both virgins, but both believing the other is experienced. It's 1962, England, just before great changes in the social mores of a generation, and the young couple see the future of their marriage--its ultimate success or failure--played out in the symbolism of their first physical act.<br /><br />McEwan uses this gimmick of unfulfilled desire to keep us turning the first 150 pages, although he weighs the story down with quite a bit of superfluous family history and description. Thankfully, at 200 pages (surely, no more than 40,000 words) \\"On Chesil Beach\\" is a novella, and so we get our resolution in due time. There are wise, even heartbreaking moments here. There's also beauty, suspense, and social commentary.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the conclusion is based on Edward's eventual summation of Florence's hesitancy and her willing acceptance of that verdict. The verdict is incongruous with her earlier stirrings of desire, which makes the book's outcome feel forced. Even more forceful is McEwan's tacked-on moral at the end of the story, as though we've subjected ourselves to 200 pages only to discover we've read an adult version of an Aesop's fable. While this life-lesson is a valid one, if not a bit trite in its hasty wording, it still left me feeling teased more than pleasured.<br /><br />Having ventured at long last into McEwan's fiction, I'll be sure to make another foray--though I can only hope it's more satisfying and less pedantic the next time around.
B000M341QE|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! The cast are some of the most talented actors in Hollywood today. The Departed put Matt Damon on the map for me. And Leonardo Dicaprio...forget it. He is absolutely amazing as the tortured William Costigan Jr. I have seen this movie no less than 50 times. I'm actually watching it right now. I'm not a huge fan of \\"gangster\\" flicks, but this one is perfect. As the viewer, we know everything that the characters are trying to figure out, but what keeps us on the edge is wondering how it's going to be played out. Will the cops figure out who Costello's rat is? Will Costello figure out who's undercover? There is so much cursing, too, which is wonderful!! Personally, cussing is a constant in my circle, but if you have sensitive ears, you might need to steer clear...<br /><br />The soundtrack is also terrific. The Dropkick Murphy's Shipping up to Boston is a key element and just seems to fitting to this movie. I love everything about this movie.!!!
B0011HOEY4|5.0|Frank Lucas is king.  No one disputes that.  They dispute it, they die.  Richie Roberts is the sole exception: an honest cop--think Serpico on steroids--who is dedicating his life and career to bringing down America's drug kingpin.  And nothing--absolutely nothing--is going to stop these two men...except each other.<br /><br />To say \\"American Gangster\\" is a thrill to watch is, quite simply, a horrible understatement.  Ridley Scott's film rockets along (despite it's epic length) at break-neck speed, fueled by stellar performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe (and when the two men meet, in the interrogation room, you'll be so enthralled you'll have to try not to giggle in excitement).  The supporting cast, too, is spectacular: Ruby Dee as Lucas's mother is a wonder; Josh Brolin is absolutely chilling as a corrupt cop; Cuba Gooding Jr., in his brief role, is fantastic (we can forgive him for his last dozen movies or so).  The rest of the cast is fantastic as well.<br /><br />I'm not saying \\"American Gangster\\" is perfect; it has its flaws, such as a couple of unnecessary side plots, and the fact that Roberts's story parallel's \\"Serpico\\" so much (it's a true story, so we can't change the facts; however, having just watched \\"Serpico\\" not too long ago, it was stuck in my head).  But...well, let's face it, you're coming to this movie to see two powerhouse actors go up against each other.  Remember Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in \\"Heat\\"?  Same thing, except with heroin.  And you're gonna get what you want, what you're expecting, plus a whole hell of a lot more.  \\"American Gangster\\" isn't quite on the classic level, but it's damn good cinema, an expertly-made film that brings a new (true) twist to the gangster movie.  Buy it, rent it, whatever--just see it.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|After two sucesfull and critically acclaimed movies,Spiderman returns to the big screen in 2007 in his third movie.While most fans knew it wouldn't turn out to be the best of the serie they still expected a good Spiderman movie.This third film in the franchise is certainly entertaining and visualy impressive and even funny at parts some could say.Yet critics said,and i have to agree with them that the decision to have three villains in the movie was probably thw worst thing to do.Those movie producers will say: \\"the more villains,the better\\",and Spiderman 3 proves that its not necessarily true.That confused a few,three bad guys in the same movie and battling Spiderman at the same time can indeed be comfusing but still the third film in the series remains a good superhero movie.<br /><br />In my opinion there are way too many superhero movies nowadays as it seems that movie studios have learned how great profits comic superhero based movies could generate.X-Men,Fantastic Four make and countless others made their beggenings on the big screen recently while other older superheroes make a comeback such as Batman,Superman and others.Spiderman managed so far to deliver a great superhero experience troughout all the trilogy and to distinguish from others.The first two films have been great translations of the famous Marvel comic to the big screen,filled with drama,action and with romance as well.Comes this third filled with action and villains,it clearly ain't the best of the three as i expected but it was still a good experience at the theater for me.<br /><br />I this third movie the storyline is kind of wicked because of the three villains but remains pretty solid overral.Peter still has feelings for Mary Jane and turns to another girl.His uncle Ben's death is further explored in this film and the killer's identity as well.Add to that Peter faces dark times with the dark Spidey suit and three villains after him and tha's the movie in short.There probably won't be as fourth Spidey because the actors wanted to move on to do other movies and that is probably packed this one with villains and all that.Also the movie relies on many great special effects maybe too much.<br /><br />Spiderman 3 is different from the other films in the franchise and that is great as sometimes sequels are too much like the original and they have no creativity,or they go too far and completly loose it.Spiderman 3 does not make those mistakes it still has some elements of the original but with a big touch of creativity.I tought Peter Parker discovering the dark suit was very interresting as it gave him this kind of dark personna nobody would have expect that too happen.His scenes in the cafe as dark spiderman are quite funny,i think that got a good laugh out of pretty much everyone!And i must admit the dark suit is pretty cool.<br /><br />The major mistake they did in the proccess of creating this third Spiderman is that they putted three vilains in it,reminescent of the Batman and Robin movie from the 1990s where the heroes had to fight many villains at the same time,as i recall that did not turn out to be a succesfull experiment.Venom would have been enough to make a movie with alone,and he's probably the coolest villain in Spiderman history.The Green Goblin only appeared in the movie for less than 10 minutes,he wouldn't have been needed.Sandman has quite an interresting story and all but was he really necessary?Besides that flaw its a really good movie,every movie has some flaws.<br /><br />To conclude i must say that this movie was nearly two movies i one actually.Had they put the Sandman's parts for another movie and added more scrip based on it it could have turned great.Even with that i have to say i was really satisfied with this third movie.There was plenty of action and the other elements that made the others so good and succesfull.I must say Topher Grace from cult show,\\"That 70s Show\\" does a great job as Venom and i didn't recognize him at all until i was told it was him!Thomas Haiden Church is made a brilliant appearance as the Sandman and the rest of the cast is great as well.I definatly recommend it,even if you haven't seen Spiderman 1 and 2 you will probably have a good time watching this.4 stars,recommended!en Church is made a brilliant appearance as the Sandman and the rest of the cast is great as well.I definatly recommend it,even if you haven't seen Spiderman 1 and 2 you will probably have a good time watching this.4 stars,recommended!
B0002Z1EG2|3.0|This album was perfect for me as I've liked a lot of Shania's singles but amn't really such a huge fan that I'd buy all her albums. Its got all the hits I know and a few I didn't so am happy with it. There are two versions of Party For Two which I felt was a little pointless as except for a change of singer dueting with Shania it was the same.
B000001FE0|2.0|How can there be a Sgt. Pepper-like 60s concept album from a famous band, that you've never heard of?  The answer is simple... because it's mostly godawful.  The same inadvertently hilarious attempt at seeming serious that made the Gibbs' acting in Sgt. Pepper a worldwide joke is on display here in galumphingly hamhanded and far too clearly enunciated lyrics on subjects like the circus and being lost at sea, set to lushly overblown orchestrations that would make an easy-listening station seem unplugged.  All that could be forgiven as 60s naivete if the album were actually tuneful, but even the best-known song, Melody Fair, doesn't quite rise to the catchiness of Bee Gees hits like New York Mining Disaster 1941 or Massachusetts.  All in all, Odessa suggests what the Beatles would have been like with three Pauls and no John or George, or maybe a Paul, an Art Garfunkel and a Dennis Wilson.
0375847227|5.0|This is a fantastic trillogy. The added \\"slides\\" help give more understanding while not trying to rewrite the story.     The only set back is that I just kept on reading until I had finished all three in one go.
0345404475|1.0|Coming off \\"Blade Runner\\", I expected the book to be a masterpiece, with deeper philosophical insight.  I knew from the start the vast amount of differences from book and movie.  And quite frankly, they are separate stories.<br /><br />I easily figured out by the end of the book the meaning of Deckard's electric sheep and why he was ashamed of it, his constant quest for real animals, and his sudden liking of the electric toad he finds at the end of the book, regardless of its authenticity, but really that was the only interesting philosophy and change of character that was neatly done and very expertly.<br /><br />The story is an absolute mess.  Taking place over only one day, Deckard is given a bounty hunting job to take out six androids after Dave Holden is nearly killed by one after retiring two himself.  Deckard almost immediately runs into Polokov (BR fans, think Leon Kowalski) and retires him.  He then goes to find Luba Luft (BR fans, think Zhora), hears her music, and is raptured.  Then he barges into her dressing room, forces her to take a Voigt-Kampff test, and she calls the police, leading to this really poorly executed attempt to get rid of Deckard and an android plot.<br /><br />According to the documentaries in the Blade Runner Final Cut, they claim there is a part in the book where Deckard is lead into this hidden world where people think he is an android killing people and convincing himself they are the androids, an implication that Deckard might be a replicant in the movie, as he may be an android in the book.<br /><br />This implication never existed.  Deckard is taken to this apparently parallel police station where everyone but the bounty hunter Phil Desch are androids, and no one knows they are there.  An entire building full of androids and no one even realizes it.  There's some confused and awkward dialogue between Deckard and Garland, another of his targeted androids, leading to Phil retiring Garland.  There's then some awkward interaction where Deckard thinks Phil is an android, and Phil waxes philosophical on life which is a bit nonsensical when left open and unrefined.  Deckard builds on this with a realization of growing empathy towards androids.<br /><br />Some scenes compared with the movie are sloppily done, with a sense of the author not really wanting to do them, but rushing through them in a film-script summary sort of manner.  For example, his giving the Voigt-Kampff test to Rachael Rosen (BR fans, think Tyrell), and when the results point to her being an android, there's a whole \\"Clue\\" climax back-and-forth with an \\"AHA!  But Rachael was born on a space ship and wasn't raised with the same morals as humans.  AHA!  The Voigt-Kampff test didn't work!  AHA!  We recorded the session to screw your assignment, Deckard\\" and Deckard \\"AHA!  One last question.  AHA!  You really ARE an android!  AHA!  You tried to trick me but failed!\\"  Of course, not literally going like that, but it certainly progresses at that sort of reckless pace without giving the reader time to digest the events.<br /><br />Most events in the book progress like this, with much of the author's focus being on esoteric, rambling philosophy he doesn't bother to put a conclusion to.  The religion of Mercerism, for example, isn't explained that it revolves around an apparently real person on an apparently real planet, who apparently needs no food or water, and apparently walks up and down a mountain while invisible \\"Killers\\" throw a rock at him every time he reaches the top, which you catch upon as the book progresses.  People go to their empathy boxes, which tunes their brainwaves or something to Mercer's brain, and people can empathize with him.  By the end of the book, the android 46-hour-a-day radio and TV performer Buster Friendly proves that Mercer isn't real, just an actor who filmed some esoteric footage of him walking up a hill and getting hit by a rock, and this suddenly becomes the basis of an entire religion.  And for somenever explained reason, Mercer appears in reality to talk to Deckard and others.<br /><br />The androids, specifically Roy and Irmgard Baty, and Pris Stratton, become almost insignificant.  The author especially acknowledges this as Deckard easily and almost carelessly kills them one by one without any sort of fight.  Deckard has this problem with killing Pris because she's identical to Rachael in model, and he's fallen in love with Rachael and had sex with her, and Pris will be the hardest of them all to kill because she looks like Rachael.  Deckard blows her away in half a second without much thought, then ALL OF A SUDDEN \\"Oh my god, I did it, I overcame, the worst is over, etcetera etceteree.\\" and happily goes on to kill Roy and Irmgard in about a page or two.  He also proves to be a complete idiot with regards to his job, as he encounters JR Isidore (BR fans, think JF Sebastian), who tells him he's housing the androids and refuses to tell Deckard where his apartment is, so Deckard says forget it and goes to explore a THOUSAND ROOM APARTMENT BUILDING on his own to find the androids.<br /><br />Also, Deckard bought a goat with half his bounty money, and for some completely random and unexplained reason, Rachael comes and kills it.<br /><br />From the start, I had high hopes and expectations, seeing a clear theme emerging, now common in some science fiction, about computerization, materilization, the loss of emotions, and the empathy of androids and humans.  By the end, it devolved into a random esoteric scribbling and rambling of a man thinking he's on to something philosophical, then goes for a bathroom break and forgets everything he's thought up, so he finishes up the book without concluding a damn thing but one; Deckard's empathy towards androids.ty to talk to Deckard and others.

1573229725|5.0|After 143 reviews todate, what more can be said about Sara Waters' Fingersmith, other than this page-turner mystery simply is a great read.  It has all the elements of a Dickersonian novel, without the verbosity of his writing style.  The characters are cruel, sinister, treacherous and duplicitous, and the plot is full of twists and turns.  The description of London and the English countryside, including the inhumane treatment of inmates in a madhouse, transports you back to the 19th Century.  What is so exciting is that Sara Waters captured this era and successfully wrote it today.
0375424474|5.0|This book is an insightful journey into the world of one of the world's pre-eminent paleontologists and evolutionary biologists: his adventures, as well as his work.  Shubin educates the common man (that's me) with a fine balance between ensuring comprehension, maintaining interest and not talking down to his readers - all with energy and excitement about his subject.  The subject is evolution, although he never mentions that word more than two or three times in the whole book.  It is the field of evolution in 2008, not in Darwin's 1830's - with a deeper more studied understanding as to how exactly we evolved from the earliest level creatures to modern man.      The first half of the book jumps back and forth topically from the author's far-reaching travels to the scientific bases underlying these adventures - - to an Arctic island and Pennsylvania highway constructions sites (in search of missing links), and to Nova Scotia tidal bays and a smoke-filled illicit mineral shop in China (in search of even stranger fossils).  The validity of the entire book is that the author and his colleagues found what they were looking for, and not by any accident.    The paleontology/biology world knew that there were nothing but fish and sea dwelling animals 400+ million years ago and that there were land amphibians 355 million years ago, so Shubin and crew journeyed to a previously unprospected island inside the Arctic Circle and found Tiktaalik - a 383 million year old hybrid fish/amphibian.  If evolution could be questioned before, it can never be reasonably questioned again - otherwise this find of a targeted fossil of a transitional fish that could do pushups in age-appropriate rocks would have to be considered the greatest coincidence in the history of science.    The book rounds off by bringing the reader into the world of evolutionary biology of today.  Shubin explains why it is now understood that many of our bodies' weaknesses (from hiccups to hernias) are due to the evolutionary path we have taken from worms to fish to man, and the interesting scientific studies that have brought us to such understanding.  These later chapters focus on separate body parts or functions, and their history as seen in our \\"predecessors.\\"    Interwoven through the entire book is the author's appreciation and love of the intricacies of the human body.  Most demonstrative was the ability that he and his colleagues have to identify a 2 inch fossil as the collar bone of a prehistoric amphibian, while the rest of us would just see a rock.  Most poignant were the emotions he felt and expressed when observing the hand of a cadaver he was assigned to study in college.      Every once in a while a book comes along that reaches out and makes us all (this country, this generation, this world) that much smarter - by bringing in a broader base of readers to catch up on a field that has progressed far beyond what we all learned about it in high school or in a Time magazine article while waiting at the dentist's office ... this is such a book!
0783229364|5.0|Many strange people come from Kansas and all of them are dreamers like Dorothea. And the way to success is paved with yellow bricks. In this film the dream comes true and the means used to do so are standard in business. One share of women, using them and being used by them. One share of good sound logic and practical intelligence. One share of pure righteous and deserved brutality with the higher-ups who are so narrow minded and egotistic that they don't even see their personal interest. One share of a well developed sniffing device known has a nose that is the intuition of a dog but also the best sanity of a man. And you get to the top. Just use the elevator please and don't get it stuck accidentally on purpose because plenty of people are expecting to use it. And you have the secret of success for a comedy that is nothing but an American Psycho in Hell's Kitchen turned into an unrestricted American Dreamo in Heaven's Dining-room. Very good, very fast, very dynamic, quite convincingly absurd and absurdly funny. Just what we need when we look at the stock exchange and think subprime.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B00110K62U|5.0|This IS a great performance of the musical, but do note that this is not a new release of this production.  A DVD with this same production was released a number of years ago when they were not able to double layer a DVD way they current do, i.e., with this one you can see the entire performance without having to flip over the DVD (Nice!).    Also this DVD comes with an extra documentary about the \\"making of the performance\\".  I am not sure if there are any other extras.    The performance itself is not a fully staged production, but very nicely  presented with the performers standing at stage front in costume. The final encore with 17 different Valjeans from world wide productions singing \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\" in their native language is truly memorable and \\"worth the price of admission\\".    Enjoy!

B0001O3YC6|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Pitch Black since I caught it in theatres.  After owning the DVD I realize that this is less of a monster movie, but more of a psychological thriller.  The character development makes the film and their actions will shock you as much as the action/gore. Look past the CGI and you will be very impressed with high quality plot and character developedment in this low budget thriller.
B000Z6MIQS|5.0|Maybe I'm just into when bands grow up past their punk sing about anything days.. now don't get me wrong I'm a fan of their last two cd's but they grew up a lot in this album. All the songs sound different as compared to their other two efforts where they kind of all sounded the same.. I'm impressed by this album and hope that their next efforts get even better off this base.. I'm all for bands changing their sound when they become better musicians.. Very good album
B00000K19E|5.0|Excellent story, excellent special effects, everything ties together seamlessly.  The matrix created a standard in which every sci fi film since must meet. Robots/Kung Fu/Slow Mo. HOLY CRAP!    Must have for any action flick lover. Too bad the next two films fell to pieces.
1563899426|5.0|All i can say about Fables is that it is absolutely beautiful. I think it belongs to the literary top of modern storytelling.     This first issue is only the start, your first train station during a magical ride. It's more like an introduction of the Fables and their world. With every trade paperback the story becomes better and deeper. For that reason this first issue is not representative for the rest of the series. But Legends in Exile is a good story with an interesting 'who done it' touch.    The storytelling is clever, sharp and with lots of humor. The art is beautiful with much detail. It is almost difficult to turn the page because you want to see all the details and miss nothing, especially the splash pages cause a difficult page turn.    Let's not forget the gorgeous cover art of James Jean, who designed every cover of the Fable issues. You can find the original covers at the start of every chapter or on the last pages of the Fables trade paperbacks.   The most of them are so beautiful that i want to have them hanging on my wall like paintings. They remind me of the art of the Sandman covers, designed by Dave Mc Kean.    Speaking of the Sandman, for me personally, Fables will accompany Sandman in the very lonely top of the pyramid.
1400063515|5.0|For anyone who deals with the financial world, this should be considered essential reading.  Likewise for anyone trying to understand the runaway popularity of a work or product, or simply to cope with other aberrations of the social sphere.  Taleb has a crucial insight here, that many things in our lives are not ruled by stable clustering of outcomes and not amenable to analysis by traditional Gaussian statistical methods. We deceive ourselves in using these tools where they do not apply, and the results can be disastrous. Only by embracing the very real possibilities of outliers and other unimagined outcomes can we successfully navigate.  The future truly is unknown and unknowable, yet we can take steps to prepare ourselves for Black Swan outcomes.     'The Black Swan' has a quirky but engaging narrative, and is easily approachable and fun -- Taleb eschews mathematical formulas and technical lingo, although those are present in the footnotes for the reader who is well-versed in math and statistics.
B000002I2I|5.0|After the critical brickbats that greeted \\"The Soft Parade\\" (1969), Jim Morrison and company made a smashing return to form with their most cohesive album. \\"Morrison Hotel\\" (1970) has no misfires. \\"Roadhouse Blues,\\" \\"You Make Me Real\\" and \\"Peace Frog\\" are among the hard-rock highlights - punctuated by effective ballads such as \\"Blue Sunday\\" and \\"Indian Summer.\\" The Doors would take their blues-oriented sound even further on \\"L.A.

1594489505|3.0|This book is a fast read, but I found that Hosseini's writing left something to be desired.  I was really surprised to see this listed on Amazon as one of the best books of 2007.  I read 'Suns' before 'The Kite Runner', and now I have no interest in reading the latter.

B00009P1O2|5.0|If you are a Queen fan, this is the MUST HAVE DVD. I personally own On Fire at the Bowl, Queen Rock Montreal, and Live at Wembly, and Wembly makes the other DVDs look silly.  This is Queen in their prime, and the best look at them you very well may ever get again.  Freddie Mercury entertains an ENORMOUS crowd by singing, talking, and wowing them with his voice. John Deacon and Brian May work magic with the guitars, and Roger Taylor not only drums excellent, but even catches Freddie off guard and has some fun with him.  They play their greatest songs to a sellout crowd who is more than happy to participate.  The camera angles are good, the extras are fun to watch, and the music speaks for itself. I guarentee you won't be able to watch it just once.
0688002307|5.0|Anybody who knows me well enough would say that this is exactly the type of book I would enjoy reading, being a blend of deep philosophy, the freedom of the open road and a spirit of adventure. And indeed, going even further, I was able to identify with both the narrator and with Phaedrus in several parts of the book, and saw various parts of my own personality and events in my life reflected in their characters and circumstances. Phaedrus, alone in his own universe, causing him to be someone who others do not always understand and who are sometimes frightened by him, when in fact he means no harm. Phaedrus who doesn't give a damn about what others think of him or being right in society's eyes as long as he knows he is right. Phaedrus, looking for meaning and purpose in life and being considered the insane one when in fact the ones doing the criticising are the ones in need of help. The narrator, going on a long drive across America as a form of therapy for the soul and a means of reflection about life and trying to determine what course his future should take and to excise some ghosts from the past.     One of the great strengths of this book is the ability of the author to present and link difficult concepts in a way that you can easily understand and which make sense. The book is heavy going in some places, but I can only imagine how much heavier going it would have been had a less skilled author tried to write it. To try and unite the concepts of ancient Greek philosophy, modern science, Eastern mysticism, and religion all into one coherent whole takes some doing, but Pirsig succeeds in this. Along the way philosophical concepts such as scientific materialism, idealism, sophism, logic, rhetoric etc. are also clearly discussed by the author, all within the underlying story of the book, together with arguments for or against these.         This book did not disappoint. In fact, the conclusions reached are quite astounding and certainly make sense. Yet I do feel that at times the way the author presents the practical application of Quality in one's life is a bit idealistic and too easy sounding. Just get interested in and value whatever you have to do and all will be fine! Even if it's fixing a motorcycle or balancing the books or picking up golf balls on a driving range ,or washing dishes. Mmm, don't think things are always quite as simple as that. But at least this is philosophy that can be applied to one's everyday life, and Pirsig makes a concerted effort to show readers how they can do so, especially so that they can live more fulfilled and meaningfully. Too often, philosophers and enlightened people are accused of being impractical dreamers whose beliefs do not address the realities of a harsh world. Not necessarily so with the ideas and concepts in this book.      So then, what is the underlying message of this book? Firstly, this is not a book about Zen Buddhist practice and nor is it a book about motorcycle maintenance. Rather, practical motorcycle maintenance is skillfully used by the author to illustrate various philosophical concepts he is thinking about during his trip (the title of this book, although strange sounding at first, was cleverly chosen by the author. I think that one of the reasons for the success of the book is its strange title. Had it been called, for example, \\"New Concepts in Modern Philosophy\\" etc. it is unlikely this book would have been the success it has been with the mass market, but that still wouldn't deter from its brilliance). Pirsig is saying that our way of dividing the world into subjects (mind/ consciousness) and objects is incorrect. There is a third entity which is independent of the two and which encompasses them: Quality, which is found in the relationship of the two with each other. It is the point at which the subject and object meet. Quality is not a thing, it is an event. It is the event at which the subject becomes aware of the object. And because without objects there can be no subject - because the objects create the subject's awareness of himself - Quality is the event at which awareness of both subjects and objects is made possible. However, it is not just the result of a collision between subject and object. The very existence of subjects and objects themselves is deduced from the Quality event. The Quality event is the cause of subjects and objects, which are then mistakenly presumed to be the cause of the Quality! While in the process of coming to the above conclusions, the author addresses such questions as: Can Quality be defined? If not, what does that imply? If it happens that Quality exists in the object, why can't scientific instruments detect it? On the other hand, if Quality is subjective, exiting only in the mind of the observer, then isn't it just a fancy name for whatever you like? Isn't an object just an intellectual construct deduced from its qualities? Pirsig continues: \\"People differ about Quality, not because Quality is different, but because people are different in term of past experience/ a priori analogues. The easiest intellectual analogue of pure Quality that most people understand is that Quality is the response of an organism to its environment. In our highly complex organic state we advanced organisms respond to our environment with an invention of many marvelous analogues. We invent earth and heavens, trees, stones and oceans, gods, music, arts, language, philosophy, engineering, science. We call these analogues reality. And they are reality! We mesmerize our children in the name of truth into knowing that they are reality. We throw anyone who does not accept these analogues into an insane asylum. But that which causes us to invent the analogues is Quality. Quality is the continuing stimulus which our environment puts upon us to create the world in which we live. All of it. Now, to take that which has caused us to create the world, and include it within the world we have created is clearly impossible. That is why Quality cannot be defined. If we do define it we are defining something less than Quality itself. Quality is the great generating force of all religions, past and present, all knowledge, everything.\\" The author then goes on to explain the striking similarities between Quality and Zen/ God/ Tao/ Buddha/ Ultimate Truth etc. How he arrives at these conclusions is explained thoroughly in the book. Read the book!          While reading the story one undoubtedly gets the feeling that the author is of course speaking about events and things that really did happen in his own life. Therefore, he really did think all the things in the book and maybe \\"crack a great secret\\". Because of the depth, brilliance and originality of the way the concepts are united, you feel a little bit of arrogance between the lines coming from the author, and sometimes it seems that he skillfully diverted such possible perceptions of the reader by letting it seem as though the characters in the book discovered everything, and not the author. The book is certainly not written in an arrogant style, and the author must have a deep and brilliant mind to have synthesized all these concepts so skillfully. Also, the part near the beginning of the book where he discusses scientific laws, like gravity for example, not being real things either but only \\"ghosts\\" in people's minds ie. subjective entities, was very interesting, and a nice stab at scientific materialism which is too often criticizes other fields for their lack of \\"objectivity\\".       One of the things I found quite surprising, but in a negative way, was that at the end of the book, in the Afterword, the author speaks about one of the characters who had passed away in real life a few years after the book had been written. The author speaks about how one is always sad when this type of thing happens and a person always wonders if one lives on after death in some form of energy etc. He mentions that he eventually came to the opinion that one does, for example his newborn daughter who seems to be the incarnation of the former person who passed away. What surprised me about this piece from the author was that you would have thought he would have had his beliefs and opinions on this sorted out long ago. I found it surprising that in a book full of such deep and penetrating insights, that he would not be sure about something as fundamental as death and what that means. I almost felt as though the author let something slip here in the very end, in the Afterword of all places. Nevertheless, this book thoroughly deserves five stars, and I know I will return to it often in order to revise the concepts and ideas presented therein to feed my soul with Quality.     (By the way, there is a very interesting website called Quantonics.com which I stumbled across a couple of years ago, and which is where I first found out about this book. They go into all these concepts in a very scientific way, using quantum physics etc. Interesting stuff.)

B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for Destruction is probably one of the greatest rock albums ever to be produced.  The album really can be listened to in it's entirety with really no filler songs.  A couple of the songs such as Sweet Child O' Mine, Paradise City, and Welcome to Jungle would make it in the top rock songs of all time.  Mr. Brownstone and Nighttrain are also voted perfect 10's in my opinion.  Only a couple of songs would not be rated 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.  Think about you and You're Crazy are the only songs that could be passed over but, they are still worth a listen.  This album made Guns n' Roses rock stars back then and they will always be remembered for this album.  This album was easily their best with other pretty good ones to follow.  If you love rock music and do not have this one, buy it.  You will probably agree with almost everyone else that this is a five star album.  Anyone who voted it lower than that probably has a problem with Axl Rose and his odd ways!

B0009S4IHY|5.0|(1) This one is a martial arts parody film co-written, co-produced, directed by and starring Stephen Chow.     (2) The plot centers around a poor Hong_kong semi-slum locality which defies surrendering to the opressive axe gang who are known for their looting and oppression.    (3) The Land Lord and land lady of this locality are superior kung-fu fighters which we come to know later on in the film    (4) Stephen Chow plays an axe-member wannabe. He wants to be part of the axe gang.    (5) There are 3 mind blowing action sequences in the film    (6) Setpiece 1: The axe gang come to intimidate and get the slum locality to bow down to them; Three of the dwellers in the locality happen to be super kung fu gurus; The three of them send the axe gang packing    (7) Setpiece2: Axe gang sends the world's 2nd best assasin team; 2 guys who by playing notes on a stringy-madarin kind of intrument,can summon and create swishing swords, arrows, axes all from thin air from the vibration of the musical notes and these weapon are flung onto the the 3 saviors of the slum locality. The assasins kill all three of the saviors.    (8) This brings the landlord and landlandy into the foray; The landlord can do superior kungfu and the landy apart from kung fu has a scream that shatters glass, stone, anything.     (9) The landlord/landlady team team up against the No 1 killer of all. He had been locked up in a cell, but is freed by the axe gang to kill the landlord/landady team after the musical killer assasin team fails to kill LL/LL team. This killer is No 1 because apart from being a kung fu master as everyone in this movie obviously is, he has the speciality of being so fast as to even catch a bullet with his fingers.    (10) Major setpiece 3: The LL/LL team fight their hearts out, and finally we get the stephen chow's matrix parody \\"the one\\" experience. There is  the famous paraody of the matrix reloaded sequence where Keannu fights 100's of agent miths. Here we have 100 of axe gang members against stephen Chow who has had a change of heart and has turned against the axe gang.    (11) In this action setpiece we see the \\"crouching tiger, hidden dragon\\" physics defying fly-kicking spiderman gravity defying kungfu. We see the all new toad style, where the villain very much becomes a toad. We also see the farthest a human being travels (upto the stratosphere actually) when getting head butted via someone conversant with the toad style of kung fu. Incidentally Stephen chow goes so high up, he puts his feet on an eagle and becomes as light as the bird and floats around before zooming back in with friction burn like one of them spiralling down satellites before he just uses his palm of \\"the one\\" and makes a devastating handprint on the earth big enough to cover 5 men.    A novel and insane comic caper with great special effects. A movie which makes fun of the kungfu genre and at the same time hieghtens this surreal kung fu experience.    regards, VIkram
B000C1ZXEU|5.0|I found this an extraordinarily gripping novel. It is set in the Igbo area of Nigeria, and the story is told by Kambili, 15 years old for most of it, who, with her 17 year old brother Jaja grows up in a Catholic family utterly in the thrall of their father Eugene, a prosperous factory owner who maintains a large clientele with hand-outs of money.  In a note about the novel, the author writes that she had wanted to portray him as `a man who did horrible things but who, ultimately, wasn't a monster.'  Personally, I can see very little to redeem him:  he is a terrifying monster, a fanatical convert to Catholicism  who is driven to paroxysms of physical cruelty whenever he feels  crossed and during which he inflicts the most grievous bodily harm on his wife and on his children.  The children suffer when they fail to come first in school, but especially whenever they fall short in the slightest respect of his extreme religious demands.  True, he weeps and hugs them afterwards, claiming that he had done it only to save their souls, but since he assaults his wife without any such excuse, he is simply a pathologically violent character.  Kambili grows up a frightened and timid girl, dreading her father but at the same time longing for his love and approval.  Jaja is more defiant, and the development of his character is also among the book's superb qualities.<br /><br />He refuses any contact with his own father, Papa-Nngukwu, who had not converted to Catholicism, and he never allows him into his palatial house in Enugu.  Papa-Nngukwu, serene in his own beliefs, lives in great but dignified poverty in the nearby town of Nsukka, not far from his daughter Ifeoma, who has an ill-paid job at the university there and three children of her own.  Eugene allows his children to meet their grandfather for exactly a quarter of an hour once a year, and he is reluctant to allow his children to visit their aunt, considering her not a good enough Catholic because she remains fond her `heathen' father;  and he is enraged if during such visits his children meet their grandfather.  Ifeoma is a wonderful strong woman, and the children love their visits to her, to her relaxed household in her run-down home,  and they come to love their grandfather also.  After Eugene had carried out a near-fatal assault on Kambili, his children are effectively taken into Ifeomo's care.<br /><br />Throughout the novel there has also been a political background.  A military coup has just taken place (presumably the coup of 1985).  Paradoxically the autocratic Eugene owns a newspaper which supports democracy against the military dictatorship, and Ifeoma, too, is an outspoken critic of the new regime.  They are therefore both in danger from the brutal soldiery.<br /><br />I must not reveal the end of the story; but it is as powerful as the rest of the book.  The whole book is suffused with the atmosphere of Nigeria, its customs, its weather, its plants and its food stuffs, its clothes, and even its language.  A glossary at the end of the Igbo words used would have been helpful, but we can guess the meaning of many of the expressions.her;  and he is enraged if during such visits his children meet their grandfather.

B000I5X80G|3.0|This is not a bad set.  It's nice to hear a live recording of Crazy Horse with original guitarist Danny Whitten.  What ruins it for me is that the bass is really flat during \\"Cowgirl in the Sand.\\"
0140288503|5.0|Like far too many other Americans, I failed to pay enough attention to the nation's involvement in Somalia. In fact, it wasn't until my wife and I stumbled into a cable broadcast of the film adaptation of \\"Black Hawk Down\\" that it really grabbed my attention. Having missed the beginning of the film, we both guessed wrong at where it even was taking place, and in fact initially mistook it for fiction.    Fittingly, Mark Bowden reveals that some of the Rangers engaged in the battle of Mogadishu had trouble accepting the reality of the horrendous situation they found themselves in, at times laughing at the absurdity of the carnage and the increasing liklihood that they would not survive a firefight in the Third World against starving people in sandals. Bowden did a masterful job of capturing those emotions, as well as chronicling all that took place in real time. In this regard, I respectfully disagree with reviewers who have criticized the pace of the book -- which I feel supported the fact that every aspect of the battle took much too long and heightened the peril.     Bowden deserves much credit for having the courage to visit Somalia for research, especially with the knowledge that four Western journalists had been murdered in Mogadishu a few years earlier. He also deserves our thanks for detailing the determination of Somalis who sacrificed themselves to achieve an objective that had become extremely important to them. I can't think of another book that does as good a job of respecting both sides and presenting an even balance of perspectives.    \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is also important because it explains how the beating the US took in Mogadishu affected foreign policy for years to come -- including decisions to avoid involvement in other nations such as Rwanda, where human rights were being trounced. I strongly encourage anyone, especially those who, like me, more or less blew off this episode of American History, to buy or borrow this book and devour it. My only caution is that the graphic descriptions of injuries are not for the faint of heart.
B00138KOEU|4.0|\\"Ammonia Avenue\\" was released in Feb of 1984, and was The Alan Parsons Project's (APP) 7th album.  It came out on the heels of \\"Eye in the Sky\\", an extremely popular disc.  While most of the earlier discs had strong central themes, the theme of this album escapes me, and seems more like an assortment of APP tracks that were done when it was time to release an album.<br /><br />As at least a few other reviewers have commented, this album has the traditional mix of APP progressive rock, pop, and mellow music, along with one instrumental track.  It differs from some earlier efforts, such as \\"I Robot\\" in that this disc has a much stronger emphasis on pop rather than progressive rock.  That worked well for APP at the time, however, since this album contained one of APP's bigger singles - \\"Don't Answer Me.\\"<br /><br />As for the rest of the tracks:<br /><br />- If you enjoy APP mellow/melancholy tracks, then check out \\"Prime Time\\" (good), \\"Since the Last Goodbye\\" (best), and the title track \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" (good).<br />- If you like APP progressive rock, then try \\"Let Me Go Home\\" (pretty good, but not great) and \\"You Don't Believe\\" (also so-so).<br />- I guess you could call these progressive pop(?), but for more of a pop sound give \\"One Good Reason\\" (OK), \\"Don't Answer Me\\" (most commercially successful track on the CD), or \\"Dancing on a Highwire\\"(only so-so).<br />- For me, the highlight of this track is the only instrumental on the disc, \\"Pipeline\\" (truly excellent).<br /><br />All in all I'd rate this CD about a 3 for a concept album, and the mixture of strong and so-so tracks, but I give it a 4 overall for the strong tracks that are there.<br /><br />This album is a MUST for APP fans, but if you are just starting your adventures with the music of APP I recommend \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\", \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\", \\"Eye in the Sky\\", or \\"Vulture Culture\\" as better starting places.<br /><br />All in all, I give this disc 4 stars.<br /><br />From a 30+ year APP fan...happy listening!
B000P12LWY|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW. It's the kind of show that hooks you in and you can't wait to find out what happens next (even though you sort of know from history). If I wanted total historical accuracy I would watch the history channel. Yes, there are some historical innacuracies..but it's about 85% accurate.   The show is beautiful. There is so much detail and drama and the acting is well done. I have seen someone complain about Jonathan Rhys Myers as Henry....well..maybe he doesn't posess the stature..but as far as personality none of us really know everything about him and I think it is acceptable for someone to do their own portrayal.   All in all I love this show and can't wait for season two! I know Showtime has a habit of cutting off these expensive series after two seasons..so I hope this won't be the case this time! I will buy every season they have on DVD!
0807014265|5.0|Frankl wrote a brilliant book.  The way of his writing is very clear and to the point.  There are a lot of psychology terms, but not so many that it makes the book confusing.  Frankl looks at the story from an unattached view, and thus he is able to give good, unbiased theories about why things happened.  This book made many of the reasons of what happened during the holocaust clearer.  It is an enjoyable and informative read.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I'll keep this short seeing how I despise long product reviews. BUY THIS!  It makes no difference in who you are, what you like, age, sex, or even how you smell.  Everybody with a Blu-ray player needs this extraordinary experience for the low Amazon price.  You can't stop watching it, it is just so enthralling how much is in this series.  Visually, this product is to other Blu-rays as to what other Blu-rays are to DVDs.  I'm a 21 year old male in the U.S. military addicted to risk-taking and action, and I could really really enjoy this adventurous series.  It makes me want to see even more of the world through teaching you so much about so much of our planet.  After seeing this, the phrase \\"it's a small world\\" will barely hold its meaning anymore. Sorry, I said I'd keep it short and I lied.  Anyways, just buy this and it will open your eyes to vivid and amazing things in more than one way.  This series is more valuable to me than the $500 80GB PS3 I watched it on.  YEA!
B00005JKJA|5.0|I've seen this movie 6 times over the years and ordered it to show some friends and family.    It's a fantastic movie, well done in every aspect; It's a mystery within a mystery within another mystery (or two!) so get ready to blow your mind, I still haven't even come close to figuring it out even with the 10 point list (clues) that accompany the DVD. It's so complicated that one internet synopsis I read was several pages, probably more printed words than the total movie dialogue; Get ready for a challange and good luck!
B000ZLFALI|3.0|I'm a Boomer who came of age in the 1960's, grew up on musicals (including all of the Rodgers/Hammerstein stuff and more), and loved the Beatles and other musicians of that era. So silly me; I thought I'd be the prime target audience for \\"Across the Universe\\".<br /><br />It didn't take long to realize, however, that this movie is more likely aimed at the MTV generation: those who were weaned on cheesy 80's videos. By then I had thrown in the towel on popular music, and didn't even own a TV for that matter.<br /><br />So sitting through two+ hours of such camp and incoherence was a bit challenging, not to mention disappointing, though there were a few clever moments, such as the rendition of \\"I Want You/She's So Heavy\\". I also enjoyed Mr. Kite, but mostly because I'm an Eddie Izzard fan.<br /><br />I will say that the versions of the songs themselves, (as far as how they SOUNDED, which is what music is about; HELLO) were pleasantly well done, contrary to some of the complaints I've heard. And it was fun to observe things like how the \\"Sadie\\" character did sometimes sound reminiscent of Janis Joplin, etc.<br /><br />Unfortunately, said enjoyment is not enough for me to recommend the movie to other Boomers, and I can't be certain what those who grew up in the post-modern era will actually get out of \\"Across the Universe\\". For a better view of the 60's, combined with whimsy, I'd recommend \\"Bobby\\".<br /><br />PS I did not view Disc 2 of this set, so I can't comment on that.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|This version of the soundtrack to the movie \\"Across the Universe\\" features all songs from the movie. The really well-made remakes of Beatles's songs are candy for everyone's ears! They are performed by the actors and actresses of the motion picture including music-legends like Bono or Joe Cocker. Simply: great music!
B00008G9JN|5.0|Another writer made a valid point when alluding to the part nostalgia can play in the appeal of an older album to an \\"older\\" listener. There is a distinction to be made between first- and second-generation Jethro Tull fans when it comes to their preferred Tull albums. I myself fall somewhere between the generations. I \\"discovered\\" Jethro Tull in the late 70's and this was the first of their albums I heard in its entirety. I was a little young to have any nostalgia for \\"Aqualung\\" or \\"Thick As A Brick\\" as new releases--I don't tie the experience of first hearing them to any significant events of my life.     Songs From The Wood is a different story. I played this album constantly during my early teens and it was as important to me as any album in those formative years. But it isn't just nostalgia that makes me rank it still today as the best album in my collection, now that the collection numbers in the thousands.     Complexity, melody, harmony, inventiveless, musicianship, literate (even poetic) lyrics, a light-hearted uplifting mood--this album has so many things a music lover can appreciate, and it has them in spades.     You can forget your preconceptions about the mad flautist perched on one leg, the \\"dinosaur rock\\" categorization this band carries in the minds of many, and the \\"Best Heavy Metal Album\\" Grammy award debacle. You can forget the fact that other Tull albums were more political, or more \\"relevent\\", or more this or more that. Just listen with open ears and mind to this album and you'll realize you're hearing a band in the act of creating a genre. Is it Prog? Is it Folk Rock? Elizabethan Rock? It's not really worth arguing over. It fits no category neatly.     But one thing it undeniably is: great. It's a songwriter and a band emerging from any categories they'd previously fit into and forging new territory. And few bands have even followed where this album's bold steps travelled. The name of Blackmore's Night comes up. And as a fan of Blackmore's Night who has travelled hundreds of miles to see them live, I can tell you they are a pale, infinitely less creative version of \\"Songs From The Wood\\"-era Tull. I'll buy every album Blackmore's Night ever releases, but only to taste in watered-down form the flavour I first sipped from that much richer Cup Of Wonder, Songs From The Wood.    This is an album that doesn't go out of style, because it was never in style. It's truly timeless, which itself wouldn't matter if it weren't some of the most intricately crafted music and literate lyrics of it's time, or of any time in pop music's history.   Listen to it once and it might not sink in--there's a lot to this music. But listen to it three or four times, and you'll have to listen a hundred more. This is a masterpiece.
0307277887|2.0|Strange that such a clever series with a witty, suave protagonist could have come from this book.  I opened Darkly Dreaming Dexter, hoping that the occasionally stiff writing of Showtime's series would be washed away by something far more clever and engaging.  Nope.  Just the opposite.  The book's lead is missing the flair of his TV alter-ego and he seems prone to major idiot-level gaffes.  The sharp banter's gone; replaced by tired puns.  The season 1 storyline is somewhat on display but apparently, the show's writers improved drastically upon the book's two-dimensional characters and the hurried, poorly-conceived climax.      It's not often I say this but the books aren't worth your time, while the show's one of the best things on television.  Dexter in the book isn't charming, isn't smart and isn't all that good as being a serial killer.  The book's further saddled with poorly written side-characters and nothing approaching the humor or wit of the series.  I only gave the book a 2 because the concept is great.  The execution of the book though?  I'm all for it.

His biggest fan, Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) receives the chance of a lifetime to meet his fictional hero, through a magic ticket that transports him inside a Slater movie.<br /><br />But the movie villain swipes the ticket and escapes into the real world. Slater and Danny must stop the crook by traveling back to reality, where the bad guys are not scripted to lose in the \\"closing\\" scene.<br /><br />Directed by John McTiernan and featuring a great cast - F.

The first time i saw this video, i was literally taken out of this world into the skies. The girls( i would rather call them as The Angels ) proved that they are the best in the earth now in Celtic music. David Downes' music makes their songs even more grand. I 've listened to this more than 20 times in one week, and i would say that its still amazing to hear the songs. If you are a lover of celtic music, this is the concert that ur waiting for. Go, grab one!! It's worth it!!

The acting and special effects are fantastic, the storyline is well constructed and director/actor Jonathan Frakes has really made the movie into one of the best sci-fi movies ever. Ms. Krige is quite a dish for a cybernetic villainess in this movie, Jerry Goldsmith's score soars high as one of his best and is the best film of the Next Generation  part of the ST franchise, a real winner in my books.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD set contains excellent sound and picture that is better then the original DVD all the way! extras include audio commentaries, Text Commentary from Denise and Michael Okuda, Teasers and Trailers, Scene deconstruction, A tribute to Jerry Goldsmith and featurettes.
B00006I53S|5.0|Many other people have already written about the quality of this lens. This is a review of Canon's customer service, which I found to be refreshingly responsive and communicative.    I received this lens as a gift and so did not have a receipt. After taking my first few pictures with it using a 20D, the shutter suddenly wouldn't trigger and the camera display read \\"Error 99.\\" I tried a few solutions offered in the manual and on the web, but none worked. So I contacted Canon's customer service by phone and right away I was pleased with their response. They didn't have a deep phone menu and I didn't have to wait long to speak to a real person. Even better, that person was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable as she walked me through the process. After hearing what I'd already tried, she had me try one more attempt to fix the problem, and when that didn't work, she assured me that Canon would fix the lens even though I didn't have the receipt and had even lost the warrantee card.    She emailed me a note with clear instructions on sending it in to Canon, with a link to the website. On the website, I entered in the serial number and it informed me that the lens was under warrantee -- how nice is that? I packed up the lens and sent it, and then I was able to check the website to see when they received it and then when it was sent back out again, which was about a week's time. (Of course, during this time I found the warrantee card, but apparently it wasn't necessary.) When the lens arrived it was in good working order and a note explained that they had replaced the element responsible for the problem.    So even though I wound up with a problematic lens, Canon took full responsibility for it and fixed it for free, all the while keeping me informed and treating me with respect. This is exactly how it should happen, but sadly I've found it to be pretty rare when dealing with other companies' customer service. I own a lot of Canon equipment and have been very happy with it,but this experience gave me a higher opinion of the company than ever before. If only all companies would treat their customers the way Canon treated me.
B00005JNQA|3.0|This was film was half bad. It wasnt anything special or great, but it kept my interest throughout. It seemed believable and plausable, the characters, for the most part felt realistic. The plot was somewhat confusing and overblown though. Its not very suspenseful nor is it very mysterious, but all in all, it wasn't terrible either. Its just one of those films that you can watch, and say OK, and just move on. Its forgettable.
0743268091|5.0|This is a deeply engaging book; one that I wasn't able to quit reading until the last page.  Harris argues coherently, logically and -- unlike many recent books that are critical of western religion --'compassionately.'  The author takes on conservative, fundamentalist forms of religion, and argues that we are at a cross-roads; that we have allowed so many malignant forms of religion to flourish in our midst -- under the guise of protecting religion from criticism -- that we are now in danger of losing our freedom.<br /><br />While many writers critical of religion argue from a solely intellectual and logical standpoint, often seeming detached from religion and cerebral, Harris engages the reader ethically, emotionally and -- dare I say it -- 'spiritually' -- without muddying his train of thought or the stringency of his arguments.  Harris' line of thought takes him into some hard places -- some of which will be easily misconstrued by some readers -- and while being thoroughly reasonable and logical, shows a degree of compassionate consideration of the issues that other writers simply don't evince.<br /><br />The implied critique of the three monotheistic western religions in this book is devastating; in human terms.  Complementing his razor-sharp negative assessment of religion, however, is a positive rhetoric about \\"spirituality.\\"  Unlike many of his fellow atheists, Harris seems to understand that there is something to the experiences human beings have had while practicing certain spiritual disciplines such as meditation.  He allows for what I have long called a \\"naturalistic\\" mysticism; an experience of the mystery of the universe, within us and beyond us.  He makes a plea for love and the whole of ethics being grounded in our biological nature, as an outgrowth of our evolutionary development, and seems to urge that while we need to outgrow religion, our sense of meaning, our ethical nature and our sense of wonder must be attended to and given a ground in science and human experience, without all of the supernatural and metaphysical rigmarole.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to come to terms with the dangers of religion (the kind that has been for too long left to its own devices in this country and has thus been allowed to mutate into forms that endanger the rest of us and that diminish the value of religion overall).  Such a person might also need to be open to spirituality and mysticism without the need for a veil of superstition, in order not to be irked by certain passages.  The author poses some hard questions, strikes out toward some equally hard answers; his positions are not always easily swallowed, and some of his opinions may need critiqued -- from one vantage or another -- yet this book is not one that you will walk away from without deep reflection and some hard thinking; i.e., it will be a spiritually as well as an ethically and intellectually rewarding read.rience, without all of the supernatural and metaphysical rigmarole.

B00003CXC7|4.0|The movie doesn't need reviewing in my opinion. Everyone at least knows about it. It's one of the greatest movies made. Not everyone loves it but most do, and should be on the shelf of anyone who likes classic movies. Not many reviewers comment on the extras. They are decent and are enjoyable enough to watch if you're interested in film. I will say that the hero worship of Hitchcock is still going strong and colors the extra features. Hitchcock was VERY talented but was possibly more master of PR rather than suspense. He did know how to put together a good team, though. A look at the extras on [[ASIN:B000AL733G Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season One]] (I think this was the one) was much more interesting.
B000641ZA4|4.0|Perhaps the best reason to buy this video is for the videos featuring Ray Wilson.  To my knowledge this is the only DVD that features these from the under-appreciated Calling All Stations release.  Most of the other videos on the DVD have been released in previous collections.    I am a devoted Genesis fan, and think that other devotees will appreciate this omnibus collection.  There is, as another reviewer has pointed out, a problem with the sound levels on the DVD.  I don't know the ins and outs of it, but it seems as if the volume fades in and out to avoid peaking-out.    Still, it is a nice collection, and I am glad that I bought it.  It should, of course, be supplemented by one of the band's live performances (e.g. [[ASIN:B00006RG9K Genesis - The Way We Walk (Live in Concert)]], [[ASIN:B0001JXOOO Live at Wembley Stadium]]) and [[ASIN:B00005OBB7 Genesis - The Genesis Songbook]].  Fans will be glad to have it.

I have been saying that for 30 years now and this DVD proves it again. The band is awesome. And with guests Uli Jon Roth,Micheal Schenker, and Herman Rarebell this is truly a must have for any Scorpions fan.It was shot during the tour for the Unbreakable album,and the track list covers all era's of the band's extensive record catalog.From Speedy's Coming and Pictured Life to Love 'Em or Leave 'Em.This show ROCKS! Crank up the surround sound and enjoy!
B000002GVO|3.0|Why are we required to waste our money for expected significant upgrade to the 1970's sound quality... when the improvement is negligible? We should be allowed to get our money back!!!    ASYLUM records (being the original label) released this CD in 1988 and has never made an effort to remaster the album for improved sound quality.    ELEKTRA records released remastered versions of most (if not all) of the EAGLES catalog with vastly superior sound quality.     However, maybe because of over-printing, or because ASYLUM does not care and still prints copies, an overwhelming majority of copies sold are of the original ASYLUM stock with deplorably flat and corrupted sound quality. Yet, on every compact disc there are stickers which promote the releases as being \\"remastered.\\"     Do not be fooled, the so-called \\"remastered\\" versions by ASYLUM are the original 1980's releases with no improvement in sound quality (let alone packaging.)     If you are seeking a genuinely \\"remastered\\" version with superior sound quality, be certain that you are purchasing a copy manufactured by ELEKTRA records.    Also note that some of the advertisements on AMAZON.com (and other websites) are promoting the ELEKTRA versions and yet because of the pathetic shennanigans of ASYLUM records (and ELEKTRA as the parent company), the versions being sold are actually the originals from ASYLUM records.    I have brought such a dastardly issue to the attention of AMAZON.com and I hope more stringent advertisement and product sales parameters will be emplaced.    Again... be careful of what you are purchasing... as the ASYLUM versions are the original 1980's versions... nothing more.
B000YA9R3C|5.0|In 1898, Daniel Plainview (Lewis) is digging in the ground, searching for a gold.  Instead, he finds oil.  Years later, he has a team working for him to pump the oil.  When one of that team is killed in an accident, Daniel takes the man's son as his own.  By 1912, Daniel is a well-known oil man.  He follows up a lead in California, only to find himself at odds with the evangelist preacher Eli Sunday (Dano).  Sunday wants $10,000 for the church before he sells the land.  After a contract is signed, Daniel reneges on the deal, and the church is left without the money.  An enemy is formed.  As Daniel continues his rise in the oil industry, the more corrupt he becomes.<br /><br />\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a fascinating character study.  Daniel is many things: friendly, ruthless, kind, violent, manipulative, and charismatic.  He knows how to get what he wants, and rises from nothing into a wealthy businessman.  Daniel Day Lewis is excellent in this part and is the film's biggest selling point.  He makes a long movie pass quickly.  The film itself is fascinating, showing the rise and fall of an oil tycoon.  The ending may turn some off, but I find it appropriate given what has gone before it.  I highly recomment \\"There Will Be Blood\\".  It is easy to see why this is an Oscar favorite.
B000X1Z0BU|3.0|Writer/director John Carney's charming little Irish musical \\"Once\\" gained steady critical favor since its quiet release into American theaters last year. Now with an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song (and win since this review was first written) its exposure has become more widespread, with its soundtrack selling consistently. Starring two musicians with scant previous acting experience - the Irish Glen Hansard and Czech Marketa Irglova - the film is acutely distinct in that its two principles write and perform the entire score themselves, telling the stories of their respective characters and how their lives intertwine.<br /><br />Emphasis on the value of dreams and loose nature of love imbues the plot, with an understated pathos informing the nature of the characters. In fact, Hansard and Irglova's roles are simply that of Guy and Girl so as to keep things universal. The film has a well-defined charm and niche appeal, but it also wallows in overly sugary romanticism and trite, self-congratulatory art. At least to a degree. If movies could be desserts, \\"Once\\" would be a creme brulee with its hard, crunchy surface of pure sugar and silky custard underneath - although it leaves a good taste, the film clearly take itself too seriously. Presentation outdoes substance.<br /><br />They may not be trained actors, but Hansard and Irglova are innately endearing with strong screen presence, amplifying Carney's story beyond its rightful realm. Because of this even their most whiney, pedestrian compositions benefit from their cinematic context. If this Guy or Girl were your friends in real life you'd probably encourage them and attend their coffeehouse gigs, yet you would also likely furrow your brow if they sold more than 100 copies of their latest demo. That is not to say that their music is of poor quality. It's not. But grabbing a guitar and howling at the moon about a love gone wrong turns stale pretty fast. Self-pity is not an art form in and of itself, regardless of the fickle taste of late 2000's record buyers. Only listeners with unrefined palettes will find anything offered here groundbreaking.<br /><br />The romantic subtext of the film is well executed because of the characters' clear mutual respect and understanding of each others' different walks of life. Irglova may be half Hansard's age, but that does not compromise the film's integrity. The Guy may be a cliched out of work musician with a job in his father's vacuum repair shop, busking the streets of Dublin in hopes of making spare change, but the way he meets the Girl is engaging and believable. The journey the kindred spirits embark upon never fails to entertain in spite of the tunes, which are mildly enjoyable at their best. No back button required.<br /><br />It is not the revolutionary musical masterpiece some have made it out to be, but \\"Once\\" is still worth a rental for those keen on romance or all things Irish. Ultimately it smacks more of cuteness than of high art, but what's wrong with that?e of late 2000's record buyers.

0684135051|4.0|I love EZ's writing style.  Even though this book was a bit too beginner-like for me, I enjoyed reading her tips, and it made it easier for me to advise some of my sisters who wanted to learn to knit.<br /><br />I think the best advise I read was that \\"washing hides a multitude of sins.\\"  Before reading this, I was quite obsessive about my knitting gauge.  I'd measure my knitting after every row (and sometimes every few stitches), just to make sure my gauge was right where it should be.  EZ, of course with wit and humor, chided people like myself who spent more time worrying about having the perfect gauge than they actually spent knitting.  She pointed out that if the gauge is off a bit, washing it will usually even things out quite a bit.  Thus the advise, \\"washing hides a multitude of sins.\\"<br /><br />Now I spend more time enjoying my knitting, which has actually allowed me to be more creative with my knitting.  After reading EZ's words, I'm no longer afraid to change a pattern if it's not exactly what I want, and (at times) I've even \\"unvented\\" my own patterns.  If you want to see the type of creativity EZ can inspire, you can get my free patterns at [...]<br /><br />I think the most important thing about this book....  EZ showed me how to actually have fun with my knitting.  In my opinion, she was the Diva of all the Knitting World.
B00102F5WK|4.0|RENDITION accomplishes a lot in presenting a story that is tough to watch, tougher to believe, and for all that is a tremendously involving and electrifying movie.  It is definitely a message film but that message is delivered by a smart script, a compassionate director, and a dream cast.<br /><br />But first the word rendition: according to the dictionary, \\"In law, rendition is a \\"surrender\\" or \\"handing over\\" of persons or property, particularly from one jurisdiction to another. For criminal suspects, extradition is the most common type of rendition. Rendition can also be seen as the act of handing over, after the request for extradition has taken place.\\"  For many this may not be news, but for those who are not privy to our Intelligence games, the concept is a terrifying one.  For this film Kelley Sane has provided director Gavin Hood with a script that examines the horrors of rendition and in doing so the two have created a story we simply cannot ignore.<br /><br />Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) is an Egyptian-born American working in South Africa as the film begins: his very pregnant wife Isabella (Reese Witherspoon) awaits his return home but when Anwar doesn't appear at the airport, the enigma begins.  Anwar has been taken prisoner in Egypt where he is tortured and interrogated for information by the cruel Abasi Fawal (Yigal Naor) while a reluctant CIA investigator Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal) stands by, the two attempting to extract secrets to be provided to the USA: behind the scenes in Washington DC the extraordinary rendition is piloted by Intelligence expert Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep).  Isabella attempts to uncover the truth of her missing husband's whereabouts and involves an old friend (Peter Sarsgaard) to help her.  Nothing goes well, not in the US or in Egypt, where the interrogator Abasi discovers the evil that is brewing within his own family. It is Isabella's persistence, Anwar's endurance,  and the ultimate heroism of Douglas Freeman that allow the resolution to the nightmare.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly strong, the grim realities of the torture chambers are almost unbearable to watch, and the in-our-face discovery of how our Intelligence system works (especially since 911) is terrifying. Added to the DVD is a short film about two men who talk about personal experiences with 'rendition'.  It is a kick in the gut and demands action from the viewer to become an activist in preventing the continuation of these tactics.  Grady Harp, February 08solution to the nightmare.

B00006AW2G|4.0|The title of this album is a play on the Beatles last official album \\"Let It Be\\".  The Stones were always the Yin to then Beatles Yang and never was it more apparent than at the end of the 60's.  The Beatles were on the verge of breaking up while the Stones would continue for another 4 plus decades.  \\"Bleed\\" is one of the Stones better albums and contains two songs that have become classics, still receiving a vast amount of airplay today.  \\"Gimmie Shelter\\", \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" rank up with the best songs of the 60's as they open and close this album.  The rest of the disc is not as good, but it is all decent Stones material.  The band covers Robert Johnson's \\"Love In Vain\\" then covers themselves with a country version of Honkey Tonk Woman called \\"Country Honk\\".  \\"Midnight Rambler\\" is good, but I think the live version on \\"Get Your Ya Ya's Out\\" is better.  \\"You Got The Silver\\" finds Keith Richards on lead vocals for the first time.  \\"Live With Me\\" and \\"Monkey Man\\" round out the album.  Original member Brian Jones would die during the making of this one, with Mick Taylor on board as his replacement.
B0013FBS20|3.0|There are a few sublime moments in \\"I Am Legend\\" that make you realize just how amazing a science fiction film can be. The genre has long been my favorite, and even though this isn't a sci-fi film in the strictest sense of the term, it has shades of the genre all through it.<br /><br />Prime moments include Will Smith entering a dark building in search of his dog, and then battling with monsters he never knew existed (literally). There is one particularly effective scene, where Will Smith knows that his dog has been 'infected', watches his dog turn into a monster before his eyes, and then kills it with his bare hands. The entire sequence plays out like a subdued exercise in human tolerance and reaction - and it was carried out superbly by Will Smith.<br /><br />In fact, it is Smiths' amazing screen presence and top-notch acting ability that makes this film as good as it is. However, he is let down by a very weak script, a nonsensical ending, and is paired opposite a tepid actress in the second half who reduces the film to a parody of itself. My primary problem with the second half is that it entirely undid all the solemn promise the first half did. The climax is a huge group of monsters (very poor CGI here) trying to attack Smith, who in turn destroys himself and the facility so that the monsters perish as well. This 'Save the World' sentiment has been overdone in way too many Hollywood films, and it just didnt work here.<br /><br />The best parts of 'I Am Legend' are when it slows down to a quiet, sombre pace. The first hour, with its languid passages of just Will Smith walking and bonding with his dog are the most poignant, and the most real. This is a one-man movie, and its a pity that when it moves away from that, it doesn't work. By no means a classic, or even a 'very good film', but this is one movie well worth watching - it could have been much, much worse.<br /><br />Three Stars.

B000YABYLA|5.0|I am in love with Juno, I really am. For me, Fox's Searchlight studio has become my personal favorite for extremly great indie comedies. They scored last year with Little Miss Sunshine (another film I absolutly love) and they do it again with Juno. But for me, I feel Juno really achieved something far greater then Little Miss Sunshine did. Not only did the film make me laugh but when I left the theater, I just couldn't help but feel uplifted and joyous. It's just one of those films that not only has a great wit but a real heart inside it. Something I did not feel with Knocked Up and Superbad and I know, people will hate me for saying that, but its true. For me, Juno was the only comedy that, I felt, really achieved the true 'heart' of a film.<br /><br />Now, most everyone is by now familiar with the story but i'll just do it again just to refresh those who have gone fuzzy. Juna MacGuff has just found out she is nine weeks pregnant, the father happening to be her longtime friend and admirer Paulie Bleaker. After originally thinking about an abortion, she has a last minute change of heart and decides to give the baby up for adoption to a family she looked up in the local Pennysaver. We are then taken through the entire process of Juno dealing with her pregnancy, the adoptive family, just really everyday life that a pregnant teen can go through.<br /><br />Now, I have been a fan of Ellen Page (Oscar Nominated this year, kudos) ever since I saw her in Hard Candy (a film that I felt really showed off her dramatic range), I just think she really is a talented young actress and true role model girls AND guys can look up to. As Juno, she combines a blend of biting wit, teen angst, and even motherly instinct into a fire cracker of a character. Another standout being Jennifer Garner, who just completly transforms her character from an icy, controling person to someone caring and warm by the end of the film. J.K. Simmons, Jason Batemen, Allison Janney, and Olivia Thirlby are also just as good, Thirlby I think having all the best lines.<br /><br />And of course, we cannot forget Diablo Cody, who crafted a heartful and witty screenplay from a topic that could have easily been just another run of the mill teen pregnancy film. If she dosen't win the Originally Screenplay Oscar, I will automatically call for a recount. As for Jason Reitman, I feel he does a good job directing this film, obviously having a flare for making smart comedies (like his previous effort, Thank You for Smoking, another great film from Searchlight) but I don't feel he should have been nominated for Best Director, I felt that the fifth slot really should have gone so Joe Wright (director of the beautiful Atonement) but still, I felt he did his job.<br /><br />I would definently place Juno on my top ten of 2007, cause for me it was one of the few highly praised films this year that I truley felt delivered on everything the critics praised about. But then again, I rarely agree with the critics, so even more props to the film that really connected with all audiences and not something that only the critics seemed to have got. So, if you truely, TRUELY, want to see a film that will not only make you laugh but give you that warm fuzzy feeling, Juno is definently the film to see., Thirlby I think having all the best lines.

1400063515|3.0|The book can be summarized in three points:  1. people behave irrationally  2. many probability distributions are not normal  3. you may think you know it (most of this stuff is normally covered in intermediate microeconomics and statistics and in many popular science books), but you are stupid anyway, especially if you are an economist, French, MBA student, a Nobel prize winner, or a member of any other group that the author hates.    The book is a decent compilation of behavioral economics and probability research with some philosophy thrown in. There are no original ideas - however, the author does his best to associate himself with people who actually have such ideas through extensive name-dropping. At least a hundred pages are devoted to elaborate insults of all the people who may have won a Nobel prize, but are too stupid to understand the author's brilliance. Taleb's previous book, Fooled by Randomness, has essentialy the same content, but a little fewer diatribes - may be a better investment.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|Being a huge fan of this 80's masterpiece, I eagerly awaited the arrival of the new DVD, certain it would contain an abundance of special features and extras. I was sadly let down. After the numerous documentaries made on the Poltergeist series, there was no excuse to keep them off of the newly released film. No only did the film NOT deliver the extra features that I expected, but it removed the theatrical trailer that was on the original DVD release. That said, the box was attractive and came with a nice protective cover which was about all the new release had to offer.<br /><br />Aside from the feature flaws, the film was supurb. The actors were believable and warrented much of my sympathy. I really cared for the Freeling family, which is more than I can say for many characters in the horror genre. The scares were valid and the film brought several common childhood fears to life. One of the final scenes involving young Robbie and his toy clown continues to frighten me each time I watch Poltergeist. Unlike many of the new horror films we see today, Poltergeist is not particularly gory and will appeal to an audience who doesn't relish an abundance of blood, gore, and innards.<br /><br />Part of what made the film such a great success was the music composed by Jerry Goldsmith who's music was also featured in The Omen. Be sure to check out the sountrack if you enjoyed the music in the film.<br /><br />I highly reccommend Poltergeist to any avid horror fan or anyone seeking a few hours of quality entertainment. Don't miss this one!

B000P2A24W|3.0|Admittedly, I didn't think much of Lost Highway upon first listen. However, it grew on me a little after I heard it a few more times. Although this is a very safe sounding album, similar to today's country music which is much closer to pop than country, they still can write some good songs. While tracks like \\"Summertime\\", \\"Whole Lot of Leavin'\\", and \\"Any Other Day\\" won't make you forget their best work, they're still very good. The tracks with more of a country twang (\\"Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore\\", \\"One Step Closer\\", \\"Seat Next To You\\", etc) are also pretty decent. There are a few clunkers here, most notably \\"We Got It Going On\\", a forced attempt at a country/rock anthem that sounds lame. All told, Lost Highway is a decent album and to their credit, at least they're not going Michael Bolton and putting out albums of cover tunes like Poison and Def Leppard.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) is everything they say it is, and more. The Greatest Album Of All Time on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time list? Sgt. Pepper. It is no less than a masterpiece. A colorful, artistic masterwork. It's cohesive, well written, perfectly performed and thoughtfully produced. By using the most advanced recording techniques of the day to cut picturesque and heartwarming songs, The Beatles and producer George Martin created a historically influential artistic triumph of gigantic proportions.<br /><br />Sgt. Pepper is a concept album where The Beatles become a fictitious band of musicians, and their variety show becomes a psychedelic trip into the unknown and then back again.<br /><br />George Martin told The Beatles to \\"think symphonically\\" during the making of the Revolver album, and they took that suggestion a step further with Sgt. Pepper.<br /><br />The album contains some of their greatest songs including the title song and it's companion, With A Little Help From My Friends, sung by Ringo. Both are classic songs that are loved all around the world.<br /><br />Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds is another Beatles classic, and an imaginative musical journey into a psychedelic wonderland.<br /><br />George Harrison's Within You Without You is an interesting Indian classical music work that features the sitar. It's one of George's best songs, and was a favorite of John Lennon's. The Hindu influence is evident in the musical meditation.<br /><br />When you see beyond yourself, then you may find<br />Peace of mind is waiting there<br />And the time will come when you see that we're all one<br />And life flows on within you and without you<br /><br />She's Leaving Home is a symphonic and heart-wrenching saga of a lonely girl moving out of her parent's home in the early morning hours while everyone's asleep. The distracted parents loved their little girl, but buying her gifts was the only way that they expressed that love. At the end of her childhood, the daughter began to feel empty and unhappy.

When I'm Sixty Four is an old fashioned clarinet jingle that's a cozy little love song and a lot of fun, too. Good Morning Good Morning is a cool rocking collage of animal sounds and street images, past and present.<br /><br />John and Paul's classic collaboration A Day In The Life closes the album brilliantly, and is one of The Beatles greatest songs.

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the quintessential Beatles album, the one that defines the nature of The Beatles as a group more effectively than any other. It perfectly highlights the four different characters of the group's talented members, and it was a wonderful place in time and in the history of The Beatles. A splendid time is guaranteed for all.<br /><br />\\"It wastwenty years ago today, Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play...\\"
037571457X|5.0|This book is about a little girl named Marji during the Iranian Revolution (Against the Shah) and the Islamic Revolution ( Against the Islamic Republic). In this book it jumps between periods of time. It starts out after the Iranian Revolution then goes back to the Iranian Revolution. The book then continues staying in the actual order of events. Another thing that is great about Persepolis is how it is a graphic novel memoir.The illustrations really help you visualize the events and lower the reading time.         This book was great. Yet I wonder will I ever be able to understand what Marji went through.This book made me greatful for how we are not oppresed.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I received this as a gift in 2006.  I remember watching some of the original series on TV when I was a kid.  I had forgotten how great this documentary was.  This is easily the best WWII documentary I have ever seen.  It's even better than the Battlefield series from Polygram video.  I can't think of any other documentary, other than The War, that is more comprehensive. There are many interviews with former soldiers, and politicians.  It was especially interesting to see interviews with Albert Speer and Traudl Junge (Hitler's former secretary). There is also a ton of terrific footage (some color). While the series focuses mainly on the War in Europe, the Pacific Theater gets good treatment.  The series starts out at present day France (1970's), showing a small burnt out town (Oradour-sur-Glane). You learn that the Germans came to this town one day and murdered every man, woman and child living there.  The town is left standing as a monument, and reminder.  This really sets the tone for the series.  The music is great, very haunting.  Laurence Olivier does a great job as narrator.  At 11 discs, with some very good extras, it will take you a while to watch it all.  It's worth it though. If you are a WWII buff, you don't want to miss this.
B0002S947K|5.0|I heard the song Trouble on Sirius music- Coffee House Acoustic on TV. I had never heard of Ray LaMontagne, but ordered the CD because of that song. All the songs are great on the CD. He sort of reminded me of Amos Lee. I really like his voice, and I plan to order more of his CD's.
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|If you have at least two marbles rolling around in your head, you can't watch SICKO and not realize the extreme lopsidedness of this well-filmed documentary. I should preface that comment with the fact that I've worked in the medical field for over two decades and know full-well that the insurance system in our country (the U.S.) is broken.<br /><br />Having enjoyed Michael Moore's previous documentaries ([[ASIN:B00008DDVV Bowling for Columbine]] and [[ASIN:B00005JNEI Fahrenheit 9/11]]), there's always been a problem with his representation of only one side of the issues. Granted that \\"the other side\\" pushes back in different ways (governmental regulations, etc.), I feel Mr. Moore could improve his standing as an upright denizen of justice (as he know doubt sees himself) if he would pull in opposing views. Bowling and Fahrenheit did some of that, but not much. And here with Sicko, Mr. Moore doesn't do it at all.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that Mr. Moore shows the downtrodden in America, those on the lower income scale (mostly), or those without homes (the disoriented lady dropped off on a corner by a cab driver after being released from a hospital), but doesn't show this same economic class when comparing insurance related issues in socialized countries (Great Britain and France). In countries with socialized medicine, Mr. Moore focuses his lens on the middle or upper class, making it seem that this is the epitome of what the U.S. lacks. Socialized medicine is shown as the golden chalice, something that will fix our ailing medical and insurance industries. The fact is that socialized medicine probably IS what the U.S. needs, but we also need to see the downside to it. Taxes will be affected heavily, wait times for various tests will probably increase, and incomes for doctors and other healthcare professionals will be curtailed. The amazing thing to me is that I don't find any of these things off-putting. I'm willing to pay extra taxes, have increased patient loads for tests, and to have my salary dropped ...if everyone in our great nation could be covered.<br /><br />For all its flaws, Sicko is entertaining. And it makes anyone who watches it think about how messed up our healthcare systems are. Seeing Cuba's minimalist medical practices is fun to watch but Mr. Moore doesn't show their limited medical supplies. Watching him and his entourage go to GitMo to try and get free healthcare was laughable and a bit stupid, though (all he needed to do to prove that there is a socialized system already in the U.S. is to go to a federal prison ...but that wouldn't have been as dramatic).<br /><br />If Mr. Moore wants to increase his exposure and retain a semblance of authority on anything he films, he'll need to improve his standards as far as showing the issues from multiple viewpoints and multiple socio-economic households., and to have my salary dropped ...if everyone in our great nation could be covered.

0316067598|4.0|What an incredibly gripping and moving account of what the fighting men of our Western allies go through on a daily basis to ensure the West stays free. Thank god that there are fine young warriors out there who are prepared to sacrifice everything for our freedom. Some of the reviews I have read indicate that there are still doubters in our own society who believe that we can just sit on our backsides and those happy, peaceful people out there in the world will be nice to us....PLEASE! So what if the book is not a literary work of art. It shows the dedication , patriotism and sheer overwhelming loyalty and heroism of our fighting troops, without whom the West would very rapidly succumb to the onslaught of radical tyranny.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|I am going to make this short because all the other bad reviews this movie got pretty much sum up my review. Horrible graphics, terrible acting, awful plot and way WAY too long. This movie should be listed as a comedy because I was laughing almost the entire time. I think they should warn you at the beginning of the movie that you should be doing drugs while watching to fully enjoy it.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|It was a sad day when one of the longest running SF TV shows in history, Star Gate: SG1, was cancelled. One should comfort oneself that at least the show is going out on a high note and is not being kept on long past its prime. Meanwhile we have Ark of Truth and one other direct to DVD film staring our intrepid space explorers to look forward to.
067144901X|5.0|This has been in our family library for all our kids to read.  The best thing I can say about it is that our 15 year old still quotes it upon occasion.  The 8 & 10 year old are enjoying sharing it (and other Boynton books) with their 18 month old baby brother as well.  They all know it by heart and no longer need the book in front of them.  One of those must have items for getting your children to love books and foster the love of reading, poetry and silliness.
1400044162|4.0|Just finished reading this novel by Chimamanda Adichie, and though hesitant to read it - given the accolades it had garnered - and wary of approaching with overblown expectations; I am relieved that it almost entirely measured up to its praise.    Many earlier comments have approximated mine so suffice it to say that I also connected immensely with some of the rich characters - Olanna, Ugwu and  Kainene to be precise. I in turn had quibbles with some of the characters. Richard as has been commented on, but also Odenigbo who, for a key character, I found a little too much of a foil for the story. Much of the conflict and contradictions we glimpse of him seems contrived and merely functional in moving the story along or providing grist to develop a more textured Olanna on. Perhaps this is because we do not get to explore this character sufficiently and he thus compares unfavorably in complexity.    That said, this is a story that has etched these characters in my mind and many parts of their narrative resonated deeply with mine. And that to me is what a great novel is about. Being Nigerian. this story and its context is also of some personal significance.    For those who, having read the novel, are interested in a 45 minute BBC rehash of Biafra and that time in Nigerian history, I found a link to a BBC documentary on YouTube that may be a starting point. Search for Biafra in case Amazon shreds the link I added here ([...]
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Pixar has proven over and over again that they know how to tell a story, and they know how to animate, and that they can do both at the same time.  Ratatouille is no different in that regard, though as you might expect a company that holds themselves to such a high standard, they are getting better.  This movie is my favorite animated motion picture of all time.<br /><br />The story is that of an immigrant community.  In this case, rats.  In the process of the story we are never asked to make the correlation between how immigrants have been (and sometimes are) treated, but the similarity is there nonetheless.  We are forced to look at our assumptions and thanks to the wonders of humor, laugh them away.  Most will walk away from the movie having enjoyed themselves and thinking nothing of the meaning.  And that's okay, because it's a movie made to entertain, not persuade.  But having said that, I encourage you to watch this with a critical eye and realize that this wonderfully charming cartoon has a lot to say.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but this movie really moved me.  I am not certain how historically accurate this movie is, but it inspired me to research the issue and the people involved.  It was not as cinematically stunning as most period pieces, but that would only have distracted from the story. This movie is a must see for everyone from every walk of life.
B000X3VN46|3.0|While I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this album I ended up not doing so. The controversial split b/w NW and Tarja, as I've stated in other places, reminds me of when Fred and Ginger stopped working together. Great individually, but not as excellent as when together.     NW's vocals are lacking (sorry Anette, though I REALLY like her. I saw them live and she has a pretty cute, infectious attitude that really doesn't come off well in the music videos... better to see her live) while on this album, the music is lacking.    I have nothing against pop-rock, indeed, I love HIM, which is more melodic and \\"poppy\\" than other metal (and I even like the Rasmus, I'm ashamed to admit it) but here the music is really sophomoric and generic. Pop-rock can be done really well and really good (as with HIM), but unfortunately it doesn't sound so here (I'm sure it's probably not her fault. Someone else writes the music, I am assuming?).    However, Tarja technically sounds much better here than other places we've heard here. I believe this can be attributed to the fact it's \\"her\\" album and I'm sure she knows her voice and strengths better than anyone else so she can direct the album in the way she would like (instead of say, someone like Tuomas, writing it all beforehand and having her perform it later).    So... for all those aching for a comparison, I liked this album a bit less than DPP. I just hope in the future she finds someone who can write better, less cliche, songs. I also want to hear some of her classical stuff out of curiosity... I hope she'll release an album like that at some point. I would absolutely LOVE her if she tackled Schumann's Liederkreis (can be sung by women or men, though it's usually sung by the latter).    (BTW so you know where I'm coming from: 20 y.o. female college student who was on the \\"let her get kicked out if she was being annoying\\" side.)
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Samuel Bronston ( King of Kings) is the master of the historical epic. El Cid went into production in Spain on the heels of King of Kings and  a number of the cast and crew came fresh from their performances in the latter. It is ironic that Bronston had the distinction have having these two films in their roadshow engagements simultaneously. I remember seeing both on Broadway the theatres were across the street from each other , El Cid at the Warner and King of Kings at the Loews State.      While King of Kings has been on DVD for about 5years it's a pleasure finally to have the long awaited El Cid. The film itself focuses in on the struggles of a nation and the struggles of individuals all of which  are resolved by the end of the film. I don't know why Bronston chose Philip Yordan to script the screenplay. I felt at times it was a little tedious. Supported by a triumphant score by Miklos Rozsa ( King of Kings ,Ben Hur ) and great acting and cinematogrsphy it was a great  spectacle .I highly recommend it.
B000LXH0AE|2.0|A man wakes up one day and discovers that he is just a text.  Sound familiar?  Obviously, some kid smitten with \\"Theory\\" decided to make a movie the way \\"Theory\\" said it should be made.      The result is humor that is so droll, not only is it not funny, it is not even humorous.  A nonentity plays the lead character who is also a nonentity.  He has no free will because, after all, he is just a text.  When he hears that he is going to die--because, as we all know from lit. class, if the main character does not die in the end, it is not ART--he gamely accepts his fate--after all, anything for literature.      At this point, my guess is that the money men, who stood to lose millions on this turkey, put their collective foot down.      To prove how serious this film is, the director and screenwriter (two young kids fresh out of college it would seem from the featurettes) cast some \\"serious\\" actors: Dustin Hoffman!  Emma Thompson!  Linda Hunt!  They also tried to pull in the Black vote with Latifah.  These heavyweights had almost nothing to do.  They are really extras.  This is essentially a one-man show.  And that one man was made a nonentity to show how serious this film is.  I'm surprised this did not win at the Sundance Film Festival.      And by the way, the \\"brief nudity\\" is a bunch of old men taking a shower.  Since this was thrown in ad hoc and has nothing to do with the story, I'd say this tells us something about the guys who made the film.      You have been warned.  Would I buy the film, knowing what I know now?  Not on your life.      Why two stars rather than one?  Because of someone I'd never seen before.  Her name is Maggie Gyllenhaal.  She was quite appealing, but had only a minor role.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|After \\"Communique\\", Dire Straits stayed quiet for almost two years, and when this album appeared in 1981, the group was a bit of an afterthought on the world music stage.  This brilliant album - considered a landmark throughout Europe - changed all of that.<br /><br />When I think of my personal favorite albums, \\"Making Movies\\" instantly comes to mind.  The opening track, \\"Tunnel Of Love\\", is an emotional, incredibly played, eight minute masterpiece featuring the E Street Band's Roy Bittan on keyboards.  The heartfelt classic \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" was a huge hit throughout Europe and was largely responsible for their revival. \\"Skateaway\\" is a unique combination of melody, haunting synthesizers and arena rock that remains a classic today.  \\"Expresso Love\\" and \\"Solid Rock\\" are excellent rockers that show off Mark Knopfler's outstanding guitar work, while \\"Hand In Hand\\" is a terrific - once again, unique - ballad.  If the album ended there, it might be the all time fave of yours truly - but the throwaway \\"Les Boys\\" is a giddy and silly cabaret number that is a poor choice to go with the remainder of this outstanding album.<br /><br />For those who think Dire Straits is all about \\"Money For Nothing\\" - this is the album to get - to know how wrong you are!

006135323X|5.0|I was lucky enough to have the chance to get a pre-release copy of Dan's book at Duke's MBA program. Dan's personal story and observations of the how people make decisions is entertaining and thought provoking. He also is constantly running experiments to back-up his theories with data that is statistically significant. This book will certainly make you examine the flaws in your decision-making and thought process--hopefully inspiring you to invent things that help you manage the downside of these habits.

B00110K62U|3.0|Wow, I have waited forever for this concert to be released on DVD, I have worn out two VHS tapes, and I can't express my disapointment. It arrived today and my wife and I disconected the phones and prepared to watch on our new 1080p with a Blu-Ray player. The DVD is very grainy a lot of the time, like looking through a screen, much of the time there are ghosts around the actors. It appears to be simply a copy of the VHS with no enhancement. It has been edited, for instance Gavroche's song exposing Javert to the students has been shortened, the entire part between the end of the concert and the entrance of the international Jean Valjeans has been cut. (It may be on the second disc, but if it is then the \\"additional material\\" is misleading) In this day of digital enhancement there is no excuse for this poor quality, my old VHS is superior. The sound track is not enhanced at all. I will only hope someone will eventually offer a real quality DVD of this great, great event.  Post Script to my original review: I just rented the 1996 version DVD from netflix and it is superb, all of the criticisms I made of the 2008 DVD are much better on this version. I heartily suggest you get on the inter-net and locate this 1996 DVD. This is DEFINITELY the dream cast!!
B000IJ7Q32|5.0|Wow, 376 reviews as of this writing.  There is probably not much I could add to this except to say that this was an eye opening and thought provoking book outlining the various challenges we face globally in the 21st century.  Read in conjunction with [[ASIN:0802142494 The Long Emergency: Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century]] you will have to fight off that general feeling of dread you get from confronting bad news.<br /><br />Your most likely response, when confronted with the challenges societies face that are laid out in the book, is denial.  You have to believe that surely there are governments, institutions and organizations that are addressing these concerns and that will save us. Unfortunately, while there are efforts being made to address many of the issues, our political and philosophical viewpoints will probably prevent us from taking the necessary measures until we are in a crisis.  How this plays out politically, philosophically and organizationally is well spelled out in the book.<br /><br />This book is on my recommended reading list of 10 books you need to read.  Get it and open your eyes.

0800177975|5.0|This movie deserves much more recognition than it gets. It is well written both in story and in the parody within the story. It's one of Arnold's better movies, along with Predator and T2. The whole concept of a boy with a magic ticket that allows mixing of both real world and fictional cinema world is brilliant. The writers covered all the major bases on this one. It's a movie I can just sit down, relax and watch over and over again. And really, it's the perfect capper to the whole 80's generation of quality, fun action movies. It's a tribute sealed with a kiss and a hell of a good time. Highly recommend it to those who enjoy 80's movies, those who enjoy well-done parodies, and those who just like to have fun and enjoy the little kid inside themselves.
B00005JLD4|5.0|True story, \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" details the long journey of three young aboriginal girls after being forcefully taken from their family in order to learn how to \\"fit into\\" aka be domestics in white society.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|My 7th grade students and I have been doing our Greek mythology  unit for 3 weeks now. In the past I have ended the unit with Hercules and the Disney version of the movie. I thought this year to end the mythology unit read about the Trojan War. The kids were really into it but confused about all of the characters. When we watched to movie together they finally understood. It sparked deep discussions and several realizations on the part of the students. It was a great culmination activity! Only had to skip 1 part (mild sexual content) but it didn't spoil the experience. Great historical references (clothing, language, traditions etc.)
B000E6EHGI|5.0|Go on, I bet you thought I made that up. Not so.<br />The Grateful Dead are an interesting idea(!) of a band - much given to 'groovin' as is their wont and gettin-on-down at EVERY ROCK FESTIVAL OF THE SEVENTIES, looking every inch like a live advert for 'Head and Shoulders'. Aah.. That's much too easy. Let's take a closer look at what we're dealing with.<br /><br />To start with 'Blues for Allah' is a VERY good title. Let's us know that despite all the hair and denim, we're not dealing with mugs here. The temptation to scoff derisorily is over-whelming, these trippy types are usually good for some shallow, simple-minded fun, at the expense of their lifestyles and ideals but if we're talking music (and I will be in a minute!) it just isn't possible to poke too much fun at 'BFA' because it's an album which is well capable of wiping the smirk off even the most determined cynics face.<br /><br />The prog-tastic symbolism is as rampant as my fevered imagination. A rubbishy, diarrhea colored sleeve, with pictures of our heroes, splendidly replete with DEEP centre-partings, giving it plenty at some lost hippy outpost, with far too many people on stage.<br />However strangely seductive the album is (and it is!), these lads know well the sheer innate insanity of the devil's own rock music, and just to prove it, the only flash of colour on the sniffy sleeve is the red-flash of the robe of Satan himself in his 'Dead' guise. Obvious to all, but re-assuring because of it.<br /><br />Groups like this survive in the world of gangs, jean-jacketed 'clubs' who wander the vast plains and deserts of the US kicking up dust, and worrying about whether the Deads' third album is better than their fifth, as they trudge loyally and dutifully to the next festival. Eagerly anticipating a three hour set, (that's two numbers in a Dead show!) and some free sandwiches. They instill a genuine sense of belonging in pre-Morrissey bed-sit types. In particular, wet behind the ears teenagers with nothing but wetness to think about, who get up at three in the afternoon, smoke dope and whinge how bad the world is.<br />Of course, if they were really subversive they would support Nixon (and Bush), and rather than trendy hippy veggie-ness, eat hearty meals of beef and tripe.<br />Instead they tread the tired and (even in the 70's) redundant boards of sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll and POINTLESS GIGGING. A coming together of like-minds (and hairstyles!) is a staple and prime ingredient of that marinating rock 'n' roll soup, in fact in some cases it's become MORE important than the music itself. No worries on that score here though, there's no way 'BFA' is going to be eclipsed by even the most dusty and leathery of the Dead's fervent acolytes.<br /><br />They remind me of the cavemen in 'One Million Years BC' who emerge from the volcanic turmoil, bleary-eyed and shaky, but with a will and determination to carry on, to finish that third 15 minute encore!<br />In a sane world, this couldn't exist but again there's that madness. That post-Vietnam thing, (the Grateful Dead are VERY Oliver Stone) that slight shifting in the hearts and minds of the youth of America. Realization had crept in, the Government manipulated Cold War insecurities had dissolved into genuine feelings of mistrust and disillusionment.<br />They tell lies, guys.<br /><br />The disaffected did what they always do, they looked for salvation in the form of the similarly dissolute. The Dead bravely stepped into the breach. The harsh flat-tops of the draft became the unsightly locks of the drag (maaan!), and bands like the Dead struck for home.<br /><br />As an entity, 'Blues for Allah' reflects the era a big solid treat and as base philosophy I can see it's attractions. You wont see any of these guys dying from stress (pretty much everything else sadly, but that's another story).<br /><br />All of the connotations and stand-points combined means that 'Blues for Allah' cannot be regarded as anything less than a major work. It stands proud as a kind of 70's picaresque, haunted and hunted by it's dreams and responsibilities.<br />It represents a kind of caving-in, an after-thought in musical terms, but we sleep sounder because of it. Friendly fire if you like.<br />It frequently turns in on itself, like a fulcrum, then twists away. Back to the point at hand - the 'Great, Grateful Dead album' - fact.<br /><br />I duck the issue, 'Blues for Allah' is probably more than we deserve, even though culturally, some of us live light years away.<br />And yes, it really is true, one of the GD (Shock! Horror!!) DOESN'T have a centre parting, obviously the end of the world is upon us...it's dreams and responsibilities.  It represents a kind of caving-in, an after-thought in musical terms, but we sleep sounder because of it. Friendly fire if you like.  It frequently turns in on itself, like a fulcrum, then twists away. Back to the point at hand - the 'Great, Grateful Dead album' - fact.

B000AL5OZK|4.0|There is a concert show entitled The Heat Is On accompanying this album.  It simulates a club appearance. Backing is provided by Lasse, Mats and Rutger. The songs are The Heat Is On, Can't Shake Loose, Wrap Your Arms Around Me, I Wish Tonight Could Last Forever, Mr. Persuasion and Shame. Agnetha emerges from the warm and safe cocoon of ABBA, a radiant butterfly spreading her wings in the sun. I waited seven years to see this show. It was rain in the desert. Wrap Your Arms Around Me is plaintive and sensuous. Agnetha is an angel in a blue dress. I Wish Tonight Could Last Forever is my favorite. There is eye contact in Mr. Persuasion. Sexy! She shakes her hair! She chastises us in Shame, shaking her finger. \\"Naughty boy!\\" She expresses herself so well in song.

B00005CDNF|5.0|ABBA's self-titled album amounted to a kind of comeback.  It was not easy following up the Waterloo success of the Eurovision contest.  It was about a year-and-half before the next crop of hits came.  SOS certainly got people's attention and remains a classic song to this day.  It is a good thing they did not call this album Mamma Mia! because it would have taken away from the future stage musical.  I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do was kind of a throwback, and I once heard a disc jockey say it reminded him of Lawrence Welk.
B000I2MRHE|4.0|This is super adorable, made really well and priced well.  It is a great idea...if your baby already enjoys tummy time.  My duaghter did NOT.  I bought this hoping to help her become more comfortable with tummy time and help her learn to crawl....didn't work.  She would stay on it for about 1.3 seconds.  She has never crawled, went straight to walking by 10 months, so oh well.  I sold mine to a friend, whose kid loves it.
B00005CDNK|5.0|The Visitors was ABBA's last studio album, and there is a sombre mood which sets it apart.  But it is a true masterpiece!  One song in particular transcends pop music. I Let The Music Speak explores the nature of creativity itself. It sees the composer as a medium through which music passes. It assumes music (art) to have a pre-existence and that we merely tune into it. The song hints of music's capacity to evoke emotions and to enhance reality. Music reconciles. Note the imagery. Streets take the artist from the city into the country. Dry leaves imply death. She is lost in a valley, a depression, blind. Her inspiration is gone. Sleep, death, writer's block. Music rescues her. Again, sexual imagery. Music is her lover. \\"I take it to me and let it flow through me.\\" Music is life itself, the voice of God! This is ABBA's most elegant song. Painting, poetry and music merge.
B000GUJZ4G|4.0|this is a comic book of an action movie, however, seeing point break as a teenager, it doesnt seem to be the case. you really think that people have fire breathers at parties, that cops can go undercover for special work-related surf lessons, that keanu reeves is cool, and so on...as an adult who knows better this is just totally illogical, i mean, radical fun.   the performances are actually really well done. patrick swayze seemed to especially lose himself in the roll and from what i've heard is or was an actuall adrenaline junkie at that time any way. he really does come off as some sort of surf guru by day/criminal at night type jeckyl and hyde character. gary busey is always way out there and is a fun sidekick for the dumb-as-rocks keanu to play off of. on that note, i never liked reeves acting. even in parenthood where he was supposed to play a bumbling retard, i was still disgusted by his lack of creativity toward such a stereotypical character. in point break he is supposed to be ice cool as SECRET AGENT JOHNNY UTAH! who has a monumental epiphony when he goes on a \\"stealth mission\\", or to us land-dwellers, night surfing that is. this special moment is realized when lori petty's character caresses his face and claims he looks like he's...well, it's such an enlightening moment i dont want to spoil anything. in reality it looks like he just got hit over the head with a surf board. which seems to be the case, stealth mission or unstealth mission.   the action moves along nicely. the movie never takes itself too seriously, even when minor characters drop like flies (you pretty much forget busey gets blasted with a shotgun to the back) the film never cuts to a crying in the rain type scene set to lonely piano keys. the bank robberies are fast and fun. the beach house parties are wild. the free fall scene is very well done and believable all the way through (you dont even question wether or not you can have a conversation while plummeting to the earth at a couple hundred miles mph).   mike nelson of mst3k and rifftrax shares my dislike for mr. reeves and if you do as well i highly suggest downloading the comedy commentary from rifftrax.com to properly enjoy this classic action flick!   as last note, keep an ear out for the dialogue. there's some real gems.
B000RG1592|5.0|Definately Blind Guardian's finest moment, there's not a weak track on this album. As stated in a previous review; the original recording was great but the remaster just punches it up a little bit (just not as much as the other Blind Guardian remasters, which the previous albums needed it). Any power metal fan that doesn't own \\"Nightfall in Middle Earth\\" is truly missing out.
0446310786|5.0|Ever since Harper Lee published her only novel, she has remained as reclusive as J.D. Salinger. Sadly, she has accomplished the almost impossible by writing the great American novel of all times.<br /><br />The characters become multi-dimensional and alive at times. Set in the deep South, the story is told from Scout's point of view. Scout has been named on countless girls ever since the publication of the book.<br /><br /> Atticus Finch is an unforgettable character immortalized by Gregory Peck in the movie version. One of the main reasons that I read this book is to see where Mrs. Dubose played by actress Ruth White's character in the film was about. At first, I thought it was a small part but boy was I wrong. Mrs. Dubose becomes an important figure in the lives of Jeremy &#34;Jem&#34; and Scout Finch as well as the other Finches.<br /><br /> The story of a rape and trial is sadly but in the end of America, Scout is like Anne Frank who provides hope in times of hopelessness and revives the hope for a better world in the Deep South where prejudice and racism runs deep alongside lynchings and cruel treatment of African Americans after slavery was abolished in 1865.<br /><br />Since she won the Congressional Medal of Freedom for her services to literature, Harper Lee has still maintained her reclusive nature. Sadly she passed after sister Alice Finch Lee died at 102 years old. She was nicknamed Atticus in a Dress by her sister Nelle.<br /><br />The novel will remain a best seller and taught in American schools. There are also stage productions all over the country as well. This novel tells a story beautifully about life in the Deep South during the Great Depression.
B000001E77|5.0|I have no idea why, but HELL has always been one of my favorite JB albums...  at-least up there with the PAYBACK... I say \\"no idea why\\" because alongside side the heavy stuff, JB also shows his willingness to take risks, no matter how embarrassing the potential results (take his funky version of WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN and a latin version of PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE and a few hit and miss Jazz standards.)<br />Interestingly enough, HELL was a two album LP and I'd say that there's one album full of the BEST OF THE BEST of Funky early/mid-70's JB... and one of... well... the risks which actually fit in pretty well... but could have been left on the cutting floor if he were a bit less ambitious.  (Read Fred Wesley's bio HIT ME, FRED for a bit more insight into the mind of JB!)<br />Aside from some of a few hits that would become classics (My Thang, Pappa Don't Take No Mess), there are a few others that should have (Hell, Cold Blooded) - - and I agree with another reviewer... a killer remake of I CAN'T STAND IT also makes the album particularly worth getting...  Another high point of the album is A MAN HAS TO GO BACK TO THE CROSSROADS.  -- Though JB will forever be remembered as the Godfather of Funk and Soul, fact is this... nobody could wail and belt out a ballad with as much power, timing and drama as him...  My all time fave ballad rendition of his, incidentally is IF I RULED THE WORLD...  He seemed to have dropped it from his show in favor of GEORGIA, a tune with similar changes.  - - If the world is fair, people will also begin to discover what a great Jazz ballad singer JB he was...  the catch though is that he was not INFLUENTIAL as a balladeer...  and for a pretty good reason: in terms of his timing, rhythmic and tonal precision on the ballads, there's just no faking it...  JB was in a league of his own. (LOST SOMEONE and SOMETIMES are other examples of JB in a mellow yet funky vibe.)<br /><br />All in all, I'd say if you're seriously getting into JB and want to go beyond the compilations, get this...<br /><br />As a final word:  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS... the album cover, artwork and overall conception makes this a full package thing...

B00005JNTX|5.0|\\"Sin city\\" is one of these films you will never be able to forget due among other things, its original style with smart blinks respect the Noir genre but told, spattered and hovered by those dark, bizarre and tragic atmosphere where no one is safe about nothing and where in every step you take, may lead you to the same entrails of the hell.<br /><br />Based on the famous entries of Robert Miller, the movie turns around two well defined stories intermingled, where the revenge and the implacable thirst of justice works out not as mere legal practice but a natural necessity in order to re-establish some sinister state of things to its place of origin.<br /><br />The first story tells about the horrible kidnapping of Nancy, by a bunch leaded by the sadistic son of a Senator and a sinister web of corruption around it. A cop resists and walks around this nasty marsh and does what the thinks he's right. But a dark complot awaits for him and after eight years in prison he will have to make justice by his own . The other mixed story collides with Nancy in the bar, where Marty tries desperately to seek the murder of Goldie the only woman who loved him although his ugliness (Mickey Rourke is in top form with this underground character who reminds to Johnny the handsome).<br /><br />The third story is about the last frontier, habited by women who live and survive from harassments, abuses, rapes and unthinkable touches of evil.<br /><br />The film is told, through voices in off, another honoured tribute to the Noir genre. There are emblematic scenes, filled of artistic violence in the middle of the endless night.<br /><br />From its immediate release, it became a cult movie.
B000YA9R3C|4.0|Having been praised for his Altmanesque work on such multi-character and interweaving storyline films as Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Paul Thomas Anderson has set out for completely new territory, and the results, while not necessarily commercially palatable for mainstream audiences, is a unique tale of greed, power, and the loss of one's soul in There Will Be Blood.  Adapted loosely from Upton Sinclair's novel, Oil, this is truly a labor of love by Anderson, who has elicited a stunning performance from Daniel Day-Lewis.    A struggling oil miner in 1898, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), slaves away on a dig until it begins to yield oil.  Years later, he raises a child as his son amid the rural setting and buys oil fields while paying little or nothing for them.   One day a stranger, Paul, offers to sell his family's land knowing there is some oil.  Plainview sets forth to this property in the guise of a hunter and makes an offer to the religious family.  The elder son, Paul's brother Eli (Paul Dano), is mistrustful.  Eventually Plainview gets his land, begins to pump oil, and coddles the locals in a public relations sleight of hand.  Although not a religious man, he subjugates his convictions to secure needed land rights.  As Eli becomes a rising force of religious zeal, Daniel becomes a wealthy oil baron.  Enter a mysterious man who has family ties to Plainview, and the quest for money and power takes on another aspect that complicates matters.  Plainview's thirst for oil will stop at nothing until he is eaten away to a vindictive, monstrous self, setting the stage for a macabre reunion with an old face.    This is a slice of the industrial revolution and the horrors of quality control in keeping with author Sinclair's The Jungle. The period setting, with its raw, forbidding environment and dangerous existence, is vividly realized.   This was a time where greedy men dealt with their own kind for personal gain, and women stood their place.  Its antecedents are other similarly themed films like Giant, Greed, and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, while it's lack of warmth and stark visuals would have impressed director Stanley Kubrick.  It was a time where future billionaire's were in the making.  As such it is a fascinating history and culture lesson all at once.  Is this how the West was really won?  Is this the darker side to Manifest Destiny?    Aside from watching Plainview's amassing of wealth, the core relationship he has with his son, who witnesses much of his machinations, is an interesting one.  Plainview at times shows paternal affection only to betray any semblance of loyalties and love for the prospect of oil.  In fact, the film is filled with betrayals such as the way Plainview cheats families out of their potential wealth and a gut wrenching scene with his son on a train.   It is a bleak film, but you've got to admire the singular vision with which Anderson and Lewis convey this character.  We are fascinated by Plainview, but we don't have to like him.    There is a scene that illustrates Plainview's willingness to sacrifice his beliefs (or non-beliefs) in order to gain more oil fields.  Set in a small church, this baptism scene is the highlight of the film and goes so over the top that it is a hoot.  Further, when Plainview makes a play for land rights among sellers, his pitch becomes canned and rehearsed like a well `oiled' commercial.  He is a selfish con man, a liar, and a cheat.  As much as you want to find something redeeming about him, it never fully emerges.   He is also a most unforgiving and vengeful man in the worst way.      Former Oscar winner (My Left Foot) Lewis, like legendary actor Paul Muni, has limited his film output over the years.  That he chose to do this based on Anderson's script speaks highly of the attraction of other high profile stars (e.g. Tom Cruise in Magnolia or Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love).  Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine) is pretty compelling as Eli, quite a weird, andominous figure.  The cinematography (Robert Elswit) recalls Days of Heaven.  The minimalist score (Jonny Greenwood) is a bit unusual as it almost becomes an accompanying sound effect than theme.    The movie does have some impressive, opening minutes that are visual without talking.  Some of the dialogue has a sadistic bite to it while the staging of scenes lends itself to a strong theatricality; despite its wide expanse of land setting, it has a claustrophobic feel.   The pace of the film, which may test the audience's patience, is quite deliberate and almost slows to a halt, but Lewis surprises and fascinates at every turn.  Watch out for the bizarre ending which may perplex some viewers.  Although some may not appreciate it, others will simply relish this informal history lesson in the making of a turn-of-the-century mogul as personified by an acting giant who is about to add another gold statuette to his collection.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart has a very concise way of explaining the powerful benefits of presence.  He really helps one to understand that by learning to still the thoughts in the mind, and not give them power and control over you, freedom is the result.  That many of our anxiety felt feelings are coming from a place of ego and not reality or being present to what's really going on in our lives.  His work reminds me of a personalized program I took called \\"Calm Confidence\\", with Sharone Benegbi, where I learned to implement techniques to calm and control my mind, and therefore changed my life forever.  I highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to live from the truest place of their heart.

Set forth in the prologue is a hint a brilliant crystallization of concepts and theories that will be accessible to a layperson like me.

B000YABYLA|4.0|Let's face it -- teen pregnancy is an ongoing problem, and is not something admirable or funny. But I have to admit, the way you handle it can be.<br /><br />That seems to be the goal of \\"Juno,\\" a relentlessly quirky, cracking-wise little comedy about a girl who makes a dumb mistake, and the smart decisions she has to make after that. While it initially seems rather precious, the Wes Andersonesque scriptings hide a bittersweet, warm little story about responsibility and love.<br /><br />After a lot of Sunny D and three pregnancy tests, Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) comes to the inevitable conclusion: she's pregnant by her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).<br /><br />Because she \\"heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant,\\" Juno initially goes in for an abortion, but ends up running out of the clinic. Instead, she's going to have the baby and give it to someone who wants one, but can't have it. So she reluctantly fesses up to her parents, and starts scouting ads for suitably (if unedgy) parents for her baby -- the wealthy Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner).<br /><br />Mark and Juno form a bond over their shared tastes, but she starts to suspect that not all is well in Yuppieland -- especially when Mark decides to break up with Vanessa, because fatherhood would force him to be a grown-up, not a rock god. As her due date approaches, Juno must decide what is best for herself, Vanessa, the baby... and just maybe, the adoring Paulie.<br /><br />Recliners on the lawn, cactus-grams, guitars with names and \\"The Wizard of Gore\\" -- it's pretty obvious that \\"Juno\\" will win prizes for kooky quirk, if nothing else. It certainly has that in spades, and while it has some awkwardly scripted moments, the colourful and acerbic portrait of a teenage girl having to make some heavy adult decisions is definitely a winning one.<br /><br />Admittedly, \\"Juno\\" is a bit too precious in the first few scenes, when we have a weird store clerk saying things like \\"Your eggo is preggo\\" and getting replies like \\"Silencio!\\" Come on, loosen up and stop trying to be cooler-than-thou.<br /><br />But as the pregnancy storyline really kicks in, \\"Juno\\" settles into a storyline that is equal parts quirky-funny and touching. Jason Reitman flavours the whole plot with his snappy, clever direction with plenty of acid-laced voiceovers from Juno, on the world around her. And Diablo Cody's dialogue ranges from deliciously sharp (\\"I'm not crying, I'm just allergic to fine home furnishing\\") to entertainingly over-the-top (\\"Phuket, Thailand!\\").<br /><br />But as witty and quirky as the plot is, it wouldn't be much if it didn't also have a heart. As the movie winds on, we get to see Juno maturing -- learning to weigh coolness vs. maturity, appreciate her family, and what is right for her baby and the Lorings -- the scene where Juno helps an upset Vanessa talk to her baby is adorable. Not to mention that our pregnant heroine has to figure out whether true love is staring her in the face.<br /><br />Ellen Page gives a note-perfect performance -- her Juno is funny, sassy, wise beyond her years, and profoundly unconventional (\\"Thundercats are go!\\"). Cera is equally good in a more subdued, lovably dorky role; it's pretty hard not to love Paulie just for being himself. And Garner and Bateman are wonderful too, as an uptight, lonely woman who desperately wants a baby, and a Peter Pan type who doesn't want to act like a grown-up.

0920668364|1.0|This book started off touching, if a little strange.  Once the child got into his teens and the mom was creeping into the room and rocking him and singing to him, it got slightly creepy.  When the mom drove over to his house when he was an adult, where he slept in a twin bed by himself, put up a ladder and broke in through his window and picked him up while he slept and rocked him and sang...that was ultra creepy.      Adults might be able to pull the heartwarming message out of this story and kids might not quite understand the creepiness, but there are better stories to teach about unconditioanl love.  Everyone is entitled to enjoy it if it resonates for them, but for me, it just feels silly and creepy.  I would much prefer to read a book that both I and my children can enjoy.

0143038419|5.0|I think what people see in this book directly reflects or mirrors their own inner lens so to speak. I got what she was doing and why she did it, and I am thankful she shared her journey. The reviews on Amazon are interesting because it is clear people either love it or they absolutely think she is selfish, self indulgent and self absorbed so they hate it. But I think that was her whole point... to take a year to be selfish, self indulgent and self absorbed. And she concludes that in the end, sometimes that is not so selfish after all, if it leads to an inner transformation that makes one a better, wiser, happier person. Because the fruits of the work then do affect others in a really positive way. You go forward in life with joy, and happiness and strength to share; not misery, depression and burdensome stuff. You create better and healthier relationships when happy and grounded. Anyway, those people who thought the author selfish really miss the point because she did something in Indonesia that is extremely kind and way beyond charitable, to help out a single mother and her daughter and the two orphans. I won't say what, but it was very generous and changed that families' life.    The general synopsis: Her marriage was an unhappy one although she does not go into much detail about why, out of respect for her ex. But she felt a tremendous amount of guilt for wanting out of the marriage, because on the \\"outside\\" it looked to everyone else as though she had everything and everything was fine. But she realized she didn't want to have children (her husband did) and I assume there were other dynamics between them that made her feel pretty miserable and like she didn't know who she was. She found herself crying on the bathroom floor a lot. So she got out of the marriage but at apparently quite a cost to herself. She was already a published author and novelist and was a contributing journalist to various publications. The husband gave her a lot of grief I take it, becauseshe wanted the divorce, not him.     She has a boyfriend whom she falls for madly and obsessively right out of the marriage. She left her marriage and tried to find solace and herself, in another man. And she admits this wasn't working. It was a roller coaster and it sounds like that relationship ended mutually. So she got an advance through her publisher, and that is how she funded her year abroad. She wanted to learn how to console herself and actually figure out who she was. She was in her early 30's and was in a full blown identity crisis. And she wanted to find God (hence the part of the story where she goes to the Ashram.) but first she starts in Italy where she wants to pursue \\"pleasure,\\" on her own terms, which she ends up defining by learning Italian and eating. Those were her pursuits in Italy, not museums, men or any other cultural thing, but learning the language and eating the food. In this section of the novel she discusses her dealings with depression and she faces a lot in herself. Her examination of her own depression and tendencies is interesting. She is trying to \\"undue\\" who and what she has been, to become who she wants to be.     That happens even more profoundly in India where she faces her demons more head on in lengthy meditations and the rigors of a disciplined Ashram life. And she meets many characters there. She has a great voice for capturing the people she meets and what she learns along the way from them. She perceives everyone she encounters as a teacher, which is a respectful philosophy I think.     Then in Bali, her goal was to find out how to balance worldly pleasures with the devotional connection to God, or spirituality. And I won't tell you what goes on there, because I would spoil the book. But I think what she set out to do, find herself, find inner peace, and to find happiness, and become a more grounded, devotional, generous person, is accomplished.    It has a lot of wisdom, a lot of laughs, a lot of insights, and that is why it is so popular.

B0000YEEGM|5.0|Name a Hollywood actor who would have accepted the role of Rainman and then turned it into an Academy Award performance over 20 years ago. I can't. Hoffman's performance is consistent with the inconsistencies of autism, a disease still unfamiliar to most. The plot is simple. Cruise is all but ignored in his father's will, with 3 million dollars set aside in an anonymous trust.He soon learns that the benefactor is an unknown autistic brother living in a facility in Cincinnati. Cruise's resentment soon turns to affection, as this unlikely duet motors cross country to Los Angeles.  Along the way they use Hoffman's incredible math skills to win $ 80,000 in Las Vegas, and Cruise is beginning to understand that Hoffman is a true genius in some ways, a helpless panic during crises.  Enter the lawyers and psychiatrists, exit Hoffman back to Ohio. But, in just one weeks' time, Cruise has grown up and seems to realize it, even though his restricted brother is apparently unaware.  Do not confuse this movie with Matt Damon's \\"The Rainmaker\\".  Both movies have plenty to say, but on completely different topics.
B000TXZVGQ|4.0|I'm a 44 year old man (as of 2008).  So my high-school years are well behind me, and were pretty far behind me when this show ran on TV.  I never watched it.  But I now have a 15 year old daughter, and I thought this series might be something my wife, daugther and I could enjoy together.    So, for my 15 year old daughter that show gets 5 stars.  (probably 10 if she could.)  My wife would probably be 4 stars, and at best, my review would be 3 stars.    This show came from the same folks who brought us THIRTYSOMETHING, and the show has many of the same plusses and minuses.  It's got snappy dialogue, lots of moral dilemnas and characters who grow and change over time.  It suffers from overly-articulate characters who spend a great deal of time navel gazing.      My daughter loved it.  I assume at some level she identified with the problems of the teens on the show.  She just absolutely got into the ups and downs of Angela and her circle of friends.  (Although we all pretty much hated Jordan Catalano and his dreamy \\"leaning.\\")  Even though she knew the series would end abruptly, her scream of frustration when the last scene unspooled was a heartfelt cry for the ages!!      My wife got into it too, although she never warmed up to the amazingly (and realistically) self-centered Angela.  All the teens in this show go around blithely ruining the lives of others.    On the other hand, while I enjoyed it okay from time to time, there were several episodes that I just couldn't sit still for.  Ironically, I really disliked the parents.  Bess Armstrong's mother was an unlikeable, uptight woman.  Graham, her husband, was mostly boring...and to me, the two rarely generated any convincing heat.  Claire Danes handled her lead role well, and the actors playing Brian, Sharon and Ricky were all good.  The actress taking on Rayanne was unconvincingly hyper all the time, and frankly, was simply overacting.  Her entire character was built in a way that stretched credibility.  (I always enjoyed Mary Kay Place's brief appearances...there's an actress for whom strength and subtlety come naturally.  Just watch her brilliant work in BIG LOVE.)    Again, I admit that as a 44 year old man, this is hardly the perfect show for me.  And even though I found much of it not terribly interesting...I too was bummed that it ended so tantalizingly close to some kind of resolution.  And I do appreciate the hours of \\"quality\\" diversion it gave my daughter...something a little more intellectually challenging that HANNAH MONTANA has to offer.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|What a delightful trip down memory lane! It's great to hear the Beatles hits all on a single disc.
B000NHG7BQ|5.0|This movie has everything!  Love, lust, friendship, betrayal, violence and beauty.  Kevin Costner gives his best performance ever in a Steve McQueen-like star turn.  Madeline Stowe, the most beautiful woman in Hollywood, shows that she can act with the best of them.  And she and Costner push the bounds of the film's original R-rating with their smoldering love scenes.  To top it off we get Anthony Quinn (in one of his last roles) giving a legendary performance as a ruthless and complex Mexican don.  Based on the classic Jim Harrison novella of the same name, \\"Revenge\\" reminds us that what you need to make a great film will never change:  an original and exciting script, wonderful actors, and a director with the vision and talent to pull it all together.
B000002UAX|5.0|This was the one Beatles album I didn't have, and I listen to it frequently, enjoying the sixties sound which has become classic.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|This soundtrack goes to prove the ability of bjork.  Overture in itself shows some of the best compositional prowess of our era, but add that to the rest of this soundtrack and you begin to understand how amazing Bjork truly is.  The only complaint I have is the exclusion of the most moving and powerful song in the movie.  The decision to exclude this track is a great misdeed to Bjork's singing ability as it is the single greatest representation of her vocal abilities ever recorded.  Listening to her completely A Capella not only wrenches your heart if you have seen the movie, but also completely haunts the soul even if you do not understand the contextual meaning.  Overall a great soundtrack to accompany one of the best movies I have ever seen.
B000002JSJ|2.0|Presence is commonly known as Zeppelin's worst album. This, however, is truth, and not up for debate. What's worse is that this album is one of the worst albums of the 70's, a mess of laziness and lack of preparation. Despite being stripped down, it somehow remains overrun with pretense, which I think would be a better name for the album, actually. This is one of the few albums I have in my collection that I truly regret owning, but it came with the box set, so what are you gonna do?<br /><br />Leading off the album is \\"Achilles Last Stand\\", supposedly Jimmy Page's favorite Zep song, apparently a fan-favorite, and, without a doubt, my least favorite song that Zeppelin ever released. I really have trouble with the appeal for this song. If Robert Plant's cat wails don't put you off within the first 5 minutes, I guess you have a decent song on your hands, but for people who like songs that don't sound like they were thrown together 3 minutes before they started recording, this is an awful song. Plant seems like he's making up the words as he goes along, and I can't imagine anyone thinking his vocalizations were a good idea. A song that could have been better if it was 5 minutes shorter and an instrumental.<br /><br />Now that a quarter of the album is over, they launch into six more throwaway tracks, none of them interesting or meaningful in any way. Nobody's Fault But Mine is still played on the radio, but it's not particularly good. Once again, Plant ruins the song with his wordless moaning.<br /><br />I'm really at a loss in reviewing this album. Led Zeppelin is easily one of the greatest bands of the 70's (or any other decade, for that matter), but this album either should have spent another year in the oven, or it should have just been trashed all together. Some people say In Through the Out Door was when they sold out, but I'm guessing they wished they could sell out with this album but the songs weren't good enough. Compared to this album, In Through the Out Door is a masterpiece. Sure, it was washed with synths, but at least it had some redeeming songs worth going back to. Presence has nothing.

0425200450|4.0|There's been a murder in compartment No. 2 on the Orient Express.  The victim was stabbed twelve times.  The body was found by the attendant when the victim didn't show up for dinner in the dining car.  Could it have been Mrs. Hubbard in the compartment next to him?  Perhaps it was Colonel Arbuthnot who had a silent, suspicious air about him?     Murder on the Orient Express leads you through an entire murder mystery, like a fly on the wall, observing everything as it unfolds.  There is a brutal murder that takes place on the train while it's in transit to its destination, but who could the killer be?  There are a number of killer prospects, because they were all on the train at the time the murder was committed and the killer could not have left the train since it's been stopped by snow drifts on the track, so we know the killer is still onboard.      We follow Mr. Hercule Poirot, detective, throughout the whole book, as it's him who's doing all of the questioning, and solving this unbelievable case.  As the book goes on each chapter has more twists than the last, and it grows more confusing until you don't know which way is up!  The people who you suspect have evidence that proves them innocent, and the people who could never be the killer are suspected for the murder!  And just when you can't make heads or tails of who to suspect, and who to throw out, Hercule sits back and reflects on all of the evidence, alibis, and clues, and solves the mystery in his head.      This mystery keeps you guessing until literally the very last chapter.  This book is a real page turner and I personally couldn't put it down and I'm sure you won't be able to either.  Another well written mystery novel by Agatha Christie, and a must read for any mystery lover.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is not your typical Hollywood movie.  The music is amazing and the acting very raw and real.  It's not for those who like the conventional ending to a movie.  It was a very decent (which was a nice surprise), inspiring movie.  One that I will watch again and again.  I have already downloaded the music from the soundtrack.
B000JCETDS|4.0|Listening to this album brings back all the fondest memories of the movie, like Jables blowing up a guy's head with his voice or flying through the clouds with Bigfoot on their way to the \\"Stwah-bewwy Wivver\\".<br /><br />The edited version I bought is even funnier with the words they have chosen to substitute instead of just dropping the audio.<br /><br />For Example:<br /><br />-Kickapoo:<br />\\"My Father says your evil, but, man, he can suck a ROCK\\"!<br />-Classico:<br />\\"He is going to MOW YOUR FREAKING GRASS and you know, his name is Kyle Gass...rocking and FREAKING rolling, etc.\\"<br />-The Government Totally Sucks:<br />\\"The goverment would BUTTERCUP his right-e-ous A!\\"<br /><br />Anyway, as you can imagine, they had a lot of \\"F-Bombs\\" to cover up, but you still get like 3 of them in for dramatic effect.<br /><br />So if you can get your hands on an edited copy, I highly recommend it, otherwise enjoy it for what it is: rockin' riffs with funny twists.

If you call yourself a fan of Black Sabbath or any music that is real then you must own this. Nothing has came out since this album(including the other two Down album's) that is this powerful! It's raw and real and probably drug induced recording will make you feel like there is hope for metal music in general. Buy this album listen to it often and feel privledged that the guy's that made this recording did it for the love of metal.If Black Sabbath(OZZY era) and old ZZtop meet's a little pot induced 90's metal wisdom from the best maker's of that kind of music this is your bag of trick's!
0446577391|4.0|Stone Cold is the third installment in the Camel Club series and is easily the best.  The first novel in the series (The Camel Club) was a bloated, convoluted mess.  The second (The Collectors) was a considerable improvement but still a far cry from `must read fiction'.  With Stone Cold, Baldacci finally delivers the knock out punch.<br /><br />Baldacci hits the ground running in Stone Cold, carrying on where The Collectors left off.  Stone Cold is lean for a Baldacci novel, maintaining a relentless pace from start to finish.  The novel incorporates two story lines: one involving a casino boss determined to track down the woman who scammed him out of millions, and one involving the son of a former CIA agent falsely accused of treason, who is methodically murdering the men responsible for his father's death.<br /><br />My only complaint (actually, more of an observation than a complaint) is related to the big showdown in the closing chapters of the novel.  There is a point (I don't want to reveal too much) where Stone is on the verge of escape after a daring rescue, when something happens to make him very angry.  He turns back and, almost single-handedly, annihilates a highly trained, heavily armed team of men.<br /><br />My issue with this scene is three-fold.  First, it's just too `Rambo-like' to be plausible.  (Stone is described as killing with such efficiency, it is as if he can direct the path of his bullets through sheer force of will).  My second gripe is the fact that Baldacci writes this scene `after-the-fact' in summary.  There is a missed opportunity for the reader to experience the action `as it happens'.  The third issue I have with this scene is the misplaced morality of it.  The men that Stone retaliates against are only foot soldiers following orders, armed with inaccurate information (much as Stone was, as a member of an elite assignation squad during the Cold War).  Stone's fury is misdirected in this case at men who are just doing their job and think that they are protecting the interests of their country.  (Rest assured, Stone will settle all old scores before the final page is turned)<br /><br />My complaint (ok - my `petty whining') about this scene is half-hearted.  There isn't much to complain about.  The genre doesn't get much better and let's face it; `Rambo-like' behavior is a requirement in this type of novel and, quite frankly, if a few faceless, nameless soldiers have to die so we can fully appreciate Stone's fury - so be it.<br /><br />The bottom line:  If The Camel Club left a bad taste in your mouth and you're reluctant to read another bad Baldacci novel, put your fears aside.  Stone Cold is a good one.  In fact, it's very good.otecting the interests of their country.

0786838655|5.0|I am a fan of the Harry Potter series and started to read this book to fill the void left by them. While this book has a lot of action and fantasy as the Harry Potter series, Percy Jackson, the protagonist and narrator of the story, is as ironic and outspoken as Ron. Which made the book that much better.  Just when I thought I wouldn't be able to live without Harry Potter (lol).......
0812548094|5.0|After finally finding a way to be together at the end of Wizard's First Rule, Richard and Kahlan are separated by sinister forces beyond their comprehension.  Each must undergo a perilous journey: Richard through the Wilds and beyond the great barrier into the Old World, a vast land beyond the three introduced in the first book; and Kahlan northward to Aydindril, through the harsh winter climate of the Midlands with a Mud-People escort, to seek the help of First Wizard Zeddicus Z'ul Zorander.<br /><br />While Richard's is the more essential for advancing the plot of the series as a whole, this is really Kahlan's story.  We finally get to see the Mother Confessor in action, as she confronts vast armies against impossible odds, and scheming politicians at home.  Her journey and fate are breathtaking and moving.<br /><br />If you liked the first book in this excellent series, you will love the second.
0552998087|2.0|I am a Bill Bryson fan but this book got old very quickly.  Older middle aged readers might relate, as I did, to the endless car trips we took when we were young, in my case from Pittsburgh to Miami Beach in the summer without air conditioning.  We loved the Burma Shave signs.    The book did have a touch of Bryson's droll humor, but complaining is not funny and endlessly finding fault left me a bit defensive about small town America.  I think younger readers would find it hard to connect with this book at all, other than as a history lesson, and the story of small towns in America is much more pleasant than depicted by Bryson. Maybe his writing can be better appreciated when his target is not so close to home.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|What can I say, its Daft Punk, its Live, and they mesh songs together.  Honestly, this is a very cool CD, I'm sorry to say that its my very FIRST Daft Punk ever. So when they mesh songs that I don't know, I can't tell where the awesomeness is, but I still bang my head and enjoy it non the less.  If your a fan of live music, enjoyed the previous Daft Punk albums, and love remixes, than this album is For You.  Enjoy.
B00005JPKE|3.0|The only reason anyone even gave this movie a glance is because Clint made it, otherwise it would have dropped off the radar. Although there were some intriguing moments of fine acting, for me, the movie did not hang well together as a whole. The dialogue was stilted and the filming and direction seemed fractured. This felt more like a play about war, than a war movie. It was very quiet. Very monochromatic. Quite dull.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|I am a long-time fan of Loreena, having all of her previous volumes, and even a few songs on speed dial, so it was with great anticipation I awaited this, her first album since her fiancee's death.  As with her many previous works, the music is utterly superb and the video was a visual treat.  For those of you who are fans, this is a must-have.  For those of you who like good Celtic music, this is a must-have.  For those of you who love the music of angels, this is an absolute must-have.  Take the time and spare the money  to get it.  You will not be disappointed.
B00081U6EG|2.0|I watched this video on HDNet last night, and I'm completely at a loss. This is supposed to be a tribute to the stratocaster, right? Please explain to me what Jamie Cullum, Amy Winehouse, and Theresa Anderson have to do with the history of the stratocaster. Jamie Cullum doesn't even have a guitar player in his band! And I know that Brian May is a guitar god and all, but he's not really known as a strat player. He even breaks out his homemade red guitar on a song or two.  Granted, there are some great performances. Gilmour can do no wrong and he sounds great on his songs. Gary Moore offers the performance of the evening with a face-melting rendition of Hendrix's \\"Red House.\\" Joe Walsh is also pretty entertaining. The rest of the show is pretty forgettable. I don't know how you do a strat tribute show without Clapton or Jeff Beck. How about Yngwie Malmsteen, Mark Knopfler, or Buddy Guy? If you want some current artists, how about John Mayer or Kenny Wayne Shepherd. You could even get somebody like John Frusciante from the Chile Peppers. This was not a fitting tribute to truly great instrument, and Fender should be ashamed of this DVD.

B00002MZ2T|5.0|its not often that you come across a cd where every single song is brilliant and you would be unhappy about missing even one of them, but this album by these two talented, brilliant men, darren hayes and daniel jones, makes the grade perfectly. particularly excellent is the haunting song \\"You Can Still Be Free\\", a touching tribute to a friend. ther is also \\"Gunning Down A Romance\\" a intense number with a little more edge to it. there is also the gorgeous song \\"I Don't Know You Anymore\\" which is just simple, just Darren's voice and a piano, with no over the top vocal gymnastics, but portrays such emotion that you feel strange speaking after its been played for fear of breaking the moment that it creates. the songs are excellent, darren's unique voice is breath-taking, every element of this cd is just spectacular. every song will keep you captivated and make you want to listen to this fantastic cd over and over again. a must have for all music fans!

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Great documentary that contains a weird mix of Drama, Reality, Propaganda and Humor.<br />The only problem I see with this Documentary is that lacks a strong objective rigor of presenting both sides of the issue.<br />Nevertheless the point he makes is 100% credible. Health Care System in the US needs a big shake up.<br />This film reflects and confirm my political views, where unfortunately you just can't apply \\"free market\\" capitalism to everything.
B0000029LG|4.0|while not my favourite michael album of all time this album is definitely one of the best albums over all of everyone. this cd really takes a punch back at everyone who's attacked or wronged him. the songs are excellent, particularly haunting and great is the song \\"Stranger In Moscow\\". and of course it includes the brilliant hit songs \\"Scream\\" (with his sister, Janet), \\"Earth Song\\" and \\"You Are Not Alone\\". this album is finished off perfectly with an uplifting cover of the song \\"Smile\\". For those of you who have heard the original and dislike it for its cheesy, old fashioned style, there is absolutely no comparison to this version. it has the most beautiful arrangment in the background along with the timing changes and the way michael sings it it becomes one of the best songs i have ever heard. there are no spectacular vocal gymnastics to aid this song, its just excellent because of the emotion it perfectly portrays. the perfect song to listen to when your having a bad day. over all, an absolutely fantastic cd!

B000000H7I|5.0|One has to wonder just how many instruments Suffocation went through when recording their first full-length album, 1991's godly \\"Effigy of the Forgotten,\\" almost two decades ago. Chances are, the number of picks, strings, fretboards, drums, and sticks were shredded, set ablaze, and pounded into splinters at the hands of this Long Island, New York-based quintet, it was in the neighborhood of a thousand. But whatever that number was, it was worth it, because the album turned out to be the band's breakthrough release, as well as an incredibly masterful and influential extreme metal landmark that would go on to inspire a whole new generation of bands.<br /><br />\\"EotF\\" is a truly uncompromising, relentlessly smoldering, massively devastating, and, well, suffocating aural onslaught. It is as technical as death metal gets, and it is so fast and brutal that it also borders on grindcore. Every band member is at the top of his game here, but especially noteworthy mention goes to the guitar duo from hell: Terrance Hobbs and Doug Cerrito, who now undeniably deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Slayer's Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Both axemen are equally amazing, and their playing is just flat-out mind-blowing in its sophistication, brilliance, talent, and perfection. They display their talents by unleashing an utterly insane, inventive, and crushing collage of excellent, savage, dizzingly intricate dogfight riffs, impossibly technical, airtight, smoke-inducing leads, and great solos. Meanwhile, Josh Barohn's good bass lines and Mike Smith's fabulously fast and impeccable drumming (i.e. almost constant blasting) combine to lay the foundation for the songs, and create an rock solid rhythm section, and vocalist Frank Mullen lays down one mean, powerful, from-the-gut (yet still intelligible) death-growl after another.<br /><br />All of these nine songs follow the same structure, so initial listens might lead some to think the album is really repetitive and monotonous. But truth be told, there are many musical wrinkles, arrangement variations, and standout tracks to be found here. Opener \\"Liege of Interactivity\\" gets the ball rolling immediately; it launches out of the starting gate with an almost frighteningly fast, earth-scorching deluge of cracking, hyper-kinetic blast beats, killer, buzzsaw riffing. The tempo slows just a tad and adopts catchy, churning riffs about midway through, but after two glass-shattering solos kick in, the remainder of the song picks up right where it left off, and whooshes by at lightning-fast speed. The proceeding title cut is equally as blindingly fast as \\"Liege of Interactivity,\\" and also has a noteworthy bass intro, a great, ascending and descending guitar solo (which actually has quite a bit of melody in it), and head-banging, mosh pit-ready breakdowns (which are tossed in only to make the next stretch even more breakneck). Following this, Suffocation take their foot off the accelerator just a little bit for \\"Infecting the Crypts,\\" a slightly more mid-tempo piece with nice, grinding riffs and great, strong bass work throughout. (In fact, there is a part in this song where the guitars drop off, and the bassist competes one-on-one against Smith's pummeling blasts.)<br /><br />Later on, \\"Habitual Infamy\\" is backed by thunderous rhythms and strategically-placed, perfectly-executed, stop-on-a-dime breakdowns; and the very appropriately titled \\"Mass Obliteration\\" sounds like Slayer on steroids - it tears the listener's head off with buzzsaw riffage, shredding solos, and catchy vocal patterns in the choruses. And elsewhere, \\"Involuntary Slaughter\\" boasts two solos (one careening, the other ripping); and set closer \\"Jesus Wept\\" features the album's best solos. Hobbs and Cerrito each get to lay down one technical, lengthy, wailing, soaring melodic solo apiece, and when combined together, they last the better part of a minute.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Seeds of the Suffering\\" and \\"Reincremation\\" are two especially masterful riff-o-ramas, and they just might be the album's biggest highpoints (I saved the best for last!). Hobbs and Cerrito simply set their fretboards on fire, and they rocket these songs forward with tons and tons of maniacally complex, crunchy, blistering riffs that duel back and forth throughout the song, with each axeman fighting to get the lead. Needless to say, the guitar acrobatics heard on both of these songs is simply astounding. (The former is also of note for its fairly long and very mazey solo, and the latter for its neck snapping tempo changes, and quick drum solo.)<br /><br />The bottom line? If there ever was an undeniably godly death-grind masterpiece (especially released in the 1990's), then this is it. \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" isn't recommended for the weak of heart, but it is absolutely essential for all metalheads worldwide.ey just might be the album's biggest highpoints (I saved the best for last!).

B00102F5WK|4.0|An Egyptian chemical engineer (Omar Metwally as El-Ibrahimi) flies home to his American wife and kid and is kidnapped by the CIA at the Washington, D.C. airport.  When nothing can be pinned on him, the CIA bigwig (played by Meryl Streep) resolves the problem thusly: \\"Put him on the plane.\\"  He is flown to Egypt to be tortured, or, to use the bastardized English of the day, \\"harshly interrogated.\\"  El-Ibrahimi is waterboarded, electrically shocked, and isolated in a hole in the wall.    Meanwhile his wife Isabella, played by Reese Witherspoon, is frantically trying to find out what happened to her husband.  In a typically Hollywoodish series of coincidences the chief torturer's daughter is also unwittingly mixed up with a member of a local terrorist group, much of this subplot following a different timeline.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays CIA analyst Douglas Freeman, who is forced to be a case officer for the first time, in a torture case no less.  Sickened by the torture, he gradually comes to believe El-Ibrahimi is innocent, and later acts accordingly.    The movie was better than I expected, given the media reviews I read.  It effectively captures the sense of confusion and fear such renditions must cause, not to mention the agony of the torture. (Some of the scenes are not for the faint of heart.)  You also feel the claustrophobia of being in the hands of people who ignore all the standard rights you may be accustomed to, such as habeas corpus.  No wonder the Magna Carta stressed that right.    The movie is clearly favorable to the El-Ibrahimi character, but not entirely one-sided.  In one scene Streep and a Senator's aide (enlisted by Witherspoon) spar over the correctness of rendition in this case and others.  He asks Streep if he should send a copy of the Constitution to her; she asks if he wants a copy of the 9/11 Commission Report, and claims such renditions had already saved 7000 Londoners.  Admittedly, though, even Streep's defense seems to be made to further demonstrate the Bush administration's facile use of numbers.  Other than a small nuke or an implausibly sophisticated biological attack, killing that many people would be a tough task indeed for terrorists.  (Governments, on the other hand, routinely kill multiples of that number all the time.)    This film works fairly well both as entertainment and as timely commentary, a bifecta not easily done.  To all but the most witless warmongers, it should introduce at least a faint misgiving that if nothing else, torturing people before finding out if they're guilty is evil.  I found myself wondering why America didn't condone torture in major wars against powerful enemies, and yet stooped so readily to the gutter to fight a minor enemy that poses no existential threat to us.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Is it possible to create a drama where the audience sympathizes with a serial killer? By the time you finish watching Season 1, the answer crescendos to a resounding YES!<br /><br />With theatrically trained Michael C. Hall as a blood-spatter forensic expert by day and a \\"taking out the trash\\" serial killer by night, this expertly cast nail-biter mixes quirky humor, relationship conflict and existential self-examination with atmospheric music, visual surprises and complex characters.<br /><br />The result is a superb show that presents a colorful layering of moral dilemmas, office politics and human psychology into one helluva entertaining drama. (Want proof? My husband and I watched the entire first season of Dexter on DVD within a few nights!)<br /><br />I knew there was quite a buzz surrounding Dexter and since I have an intrinsic fascination with \\"separate lives\\" serial killers (e.g. BTK), I was eager to view the series. When I saw that Deb Aquila was a casting director, the anticipation increased. (For those who don't know, Deb Aquila has an outstanding ability to cast actors, especially police dramas. FX's The Shield is but one example of her uncanny ability to pair the right actor with the perfect role.)<br /><br />I'd rather not give you a run-down on each episode (which you could readily find elsewhere), but suffice to say that this mature-rated drama raises profound questions on one level while satisfying \\"entertain me!\\" cravings on another. What is family? Is killing ever moral? What is justice? Is blood thicker than water? Are humans more a product of genes or the environment? Do emotions define relationships?<br /><br />You won't find much in the Bonus Features in Season 1 (unfortunately), but the cast bios were intriguing. (I wasn't familiar with ANY of the characters except recognizing \\"Debra Morgan\\" as the actress who played the central character in The Exorcism of Emily Rose). For example, the actor who plays Angel Batista was an NYPD cop before becoming an actor; he heads up a theater company with Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman.<br /><br />Amidst the cloying heat and mambo music of Miami walks an \\"ethical\\" serial killer with a code taught by his adoptive cop father, Harry.

006135323X|5.0|I had the pleasure and honor of taking Dan Ariely's class at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University last term. Through the class, we were allowed to read an early edition of this book. I can attest to the fact that is an amazing book written by an equally outstanding person. Professor Ariely proves through his research (often, in very funny and unique ways!) that the traditional notion of economists that people act rationally is false and overly simplistic. We often as humans react to the world in very irrational ways - otherwise, we'd all save for retirement, be faithful to our diets, and never act out of anger. However, while shining a spotlight on this point in this research, he also gives us hope. While we are at times irrational, we are many times \\"predictably\\" irrational. And, through his research, he presents real-world problems (savings, diets, anger, health care) and seeks to find solutions that takes into account our imperfections. It is a wonderfully written book - his way of writing isn't academic; instead it draws you into his life and passion for finding better ways for us as humans to live and understand our imperfections. I highly recommend it for anyone either in business or the social sector - it is equally relevant to both sectors. It is one of those books that you will not be able to put down and you'll share the insights with everyone you know. You won't regret buying this book.

Statements she made about people in her life and how she viewed them- I simply replaced the character's name with a person in my life and it was like the advice I have been looking for for a long time... I laughed (at Richard mostly), I cried, I took a good look at myself.  Her life transformation inspired me to transform my life.  This may sound dramatic, but entirely true.  I can't wait to read it again and see what else I can pull from it next time.
006135323X|5.0|I had the privilige to take Dan's class at Duke last fall, and got to read the book first hand before it was even published. the experiments described are absolutely hilarious but insightful at the same time. Dan chooses to write in a readable manner - you will get clear, concise descriptions of his work and interesting findings, instead of hard to understand academic jargon. I thoroughly enjoyed discovering little insights to our daily lives.

0553582453|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this book.  But I enjoyed it as a part of the overall Fool/Fitz story.  I think had I read this book while the series was being written, before the third was published, I'd have had a less charitable opinion.  The Hobb books I've read all give something of a satisfying ending (or at least an ending) to each individual book without compromising the overall storyline.  This one didn't.  Not a big deal with the third book at hand, but still something I didn't like about this book.  It also felt slow.  I agree that primarily this book, indeed, most of the Fitz books are focused on Fitz's development as a character, but I felt this book was less him developing and more me being frustrated with him still trying to hide from his old life in plain sight and the struggles and frustrations birthed by that.<br /><br />Still, I love Fitz's storyline from the beginning of Assassin on, so this book is a must read and its shortcomings are highly forgivable.
0321213351|3.0|There are a lot of nuggets of wisdom in the book, especially in the pragmatic approach the author takes to refactoring and patterns. He admits that patterns can make code worse, or better, depending on the need and skill of the author.  He also provides a number of clear examples. However, the style of the book is like the dull works I had to read in graduate school, unnecessarily littered with citations. He cites Fowler to such an obscene degree that it looks more like academic backslapping. Citations are fine when doing a review of literature or examining research, but when they are used for mere quotations, the style is intrusive. As a final complaint, I found that I could often read a whole page and reduce it to one or two sentences.  Curiously, he cites an example of Benjamin Franklin trimming a long phrase down to a single person's name.  I wish he would have refactored the book in the same way.  Almost all programming practices books suffer in the same way: dull, ungodly verbose, academic, and making unnecessary deviations from the point at hand.  My suggestion is to get good at skimming, and you will find this book to be worthwhile.
0553582445|4.0|After a heartbreaking end for Fitz in the Farseer books, a return to his life, one that's not completely tragic, was refreshing.  Unfortunately I think too much time was spent, half the book really, detailing Fitz's current life and re-introducing him, one person at a time, to his old life.  It left the main plot of the book feeling thin.  Interesting, but thin.  True to character, Fitz continued to face tragedy and disappointment more often than should be allowed, but that's the Fitz we'd come to know and love.  Nighteyes wasn't a strong enough character in this book for me, understandably I suppose, but it would have been nice to have more of him.<br /><br />Still, Hobb's writing is lovely and more entertaining than in the Farseer books.  The plot is interesting and believable and as usual, the characters are clear, complex, and compelling.<br /><br />All in all, an essential and enjoyable read for any Farseer fan.
B00003CX95|4.0|\\"Braveheart\\" was first released in 1995 with an onslaught of positive reviews.  The longevity of the feature, the ability to direct as well as star, as well as the historical topic developed secured Mel Gibson an Oscar win.  His trophies for Best Director as well as Best Feature proved that he was more than just a pretty boy asking top dollar to bring in the audiences - he was excited about the art of filmmaking.  While he did not quite prove it with his film outings afterwards (who can remember the disaster known as \\"Conspiracy Theory\\" or \\"Ransom\\"), it is in today's growing recycled clich&eacute; Hollywood standard that Mr. Gibson has proven himself.  With two less mainstream success stories under his belt (both \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" as well as \\"Apocalypto\\"), he has challenged a modern empire and succeeded.  Revisiting Gibson's second directing decision; one must challenge themselves to look beyond the pitfalls, the missing story elements, and the abrupt ending to see the sophomoric feature Gibson gave to us.  \\"Braveheart\\" isn't perfection, yet it doesn't strive to be - it merely wants to tell a love story set upon the backdrop of historical choices.  Worthy of its wins in 1995, \\"Braveheart\\" proved to be a bit choppy in 2008, but still a great way to spend nearly three hours.<br /><br />Gibson, to create \\"Braveheart\\", pulled from every epic imaginable.  His use of battle sequences, heroics, and individuality ring eerily close to that of \\"Spartacus\\", \\"Gladiator\\", and \\"Ben-Hur\\", yet even with these clich&eacute;s riding well within the film, Gibson creates his own style and voice.  Watching this epic, one must take it in four different slices to fully appreciate the work, and while they all may pair differently apart, it is what they do together that creates the magic.  To begin, the direction is nearly flawless.  A scene that stands out is when one of the nobles is dreaming of an attacking Wallace, only to wake and witness Wallace barge in through the door in a beautiful black stallion.  It, like many other scenes, was breathtaking and flawless.  Gibson has an eye for shots that are considered \\"beautifully gruesome\\", meaning that colors, placement, and camera angle are visionary, while the action on screen may make your stomach a bit squeamish.  His direction showed a realistic view of the battle and filth surrounding Scotland during this dark time, and it is his work behind the camera that continues to make this film rank amongst the greatest ever.  Remember, Gibson won for Best Director and Best Film - which should be kept in mind as we unwrap the other three layers to this film.<br /><br />The next element that one must slice into is the story, which in my eyes, is the weakest element to this film.  While it is emotional to watch the love story unfold, the eye-candy battle sequences, and the picture-esque view of Scotland, there seemed to be a lacking \\"meat\\" to this story.  Wallace was angered by what happened to his one true love, but we never get the chance to see his years of living with Uncle Argyle come into fruition.  He spouts Latin and French randomly, he uses original battle tactics, and there is talk of Rome at one point, but I wouldn't have found it difficult at all to see a young William Wallace take shape under Argyle.  It would have been impressive to see this hero's roots, to take his passion from more than just his father's death into a whole new realm.  Throughout this film, watching it in 2008, there wasn't much substance to Wallace.  He fought with pride, patriotism, and with his heart, but we never were able to define him as a character.  We knew he could fight - but how?  We knew he loved this girl from the village - but we needed a deeper back story!  The fight scenes were brilliant, but they did not help me see the true William Wallace.  We charged through the film making it from points A to B to C, but never gave us the appetizers in between.  More critical today of films than I was in 1995, perhaps a viewpoint from the English side would have strengthened the background.  I don't believe all English were this harsh, where were the other elements that may have helped Wallace's crusade?  These are just missing pieces that would have strengthened \\"Braveheart\\" and pushed it to a new level.<br /><br />Needless to say, the next slice is sound.  The power of the battlefield, the yell of Wallace's \\"FREEDOM\\" and the bagpipes echoing through James Horner's score engulfs the power of the film.  It is the sound that makes \\"Braveheart\\" the epic that it is.  Without the sounds of battle, without the sounds of the majestic mountains, without the sound of love - this could not have won the awards it did.  As a viewer, it is the most exciting part of this film and the flawless.  While one can argue there are directorial decisions that Gibson could have done better, stronger acting choices, and a more structured story - it is the sound that goes without question.  It is perfection.  Horner's work is mesmerizing and fantastic.  He should have won an Oscar for his sole work on this picture.<br /><br />Finally, there is the acting of \\"Braveheart\\".  Gibson wasn't nominated for an Oscar, which doesn't surprise me watching it now in 2008.  Gibson, prior to this film, was thought of as the pretty boy/bad boy persona.  Seeing it in the theaters women were swooning over the scantily clad Gibson and that in itself proves that he didn't shake the predetermined image.  There were scenes in which Gibson was smiling, or that his eyes seemed to be bluer than the sky, or that blood seemed to be splattered to an exact location on his body - he seemed to have trouble shaking the beauty of Gibson - and I fault him for that.  The others in the film were decent, but nobody stood out as exemplary.  Coupled with the less meaty story, the characters seemed clich&eacute; ridden.  There was the \\"best-friend\\", the \\"love-interest\\", the bad King, and the loyal psychopath - all of which can be seen in any other period piece film.  I don't believe the acting was up to par with the rest of the film, and the Academy noticed.  Gibson played a shaggy Scotsman - it was Mel Gibson - albeit he does a great job with the film, one cannot seem to shake the idea that it is Mel Gibson - and that is why he was awarded no win nor nomination.<br /><br />Overall, despite my best efforts to find major flaws with this film, it is still an amazing piece of cinema to watch.  \\"Braveheart\\" deserves every award that it has won and others should credit it as the launching pad that finally gave us \\"Last Temptation of Christ\\" and \\"Apocalypto\\".  Gibson has taken his fame from this film, changed the glamour of it all, and handed us some gritty portraits of the past.  I wish he could have done the same here, but I don't think 1995 was ready for it.  Gibson pushed the envelope with gore and carnage, and it continues to steal your breath away - yet \\"Braveheart\\" needed to be more than just that.  He couples it with amazing sound, but troubles it with a struggling story and weak characters.  Today, Gibson could shake our minds that he is not Mel Gibson, but in this year - he was that same female dream model.  This is an amazing film.  It deserves a memorable page in our cinematic history, but it isn't perfect.  I believe Mel saw that, and changed it for his post-\\"Braveheart\\" releases.  In a day when our own freedom is put into question, this is the type of film that will stagger your emotions and pull at your heartstrings.  Gibson is a master at his craft, don't get me wrong - this just isn't the sterling image of perfection.  Watch it - over and over.  It may be a long film, but it is worth every minute.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****English side would have strengthened the background.

B0011HF6GE|5.0|I've heard a review say this album is kind of a mix between the vocals of TV on the Radio, with the music of Iron and Wine - I'd say that is a fair assessment. Maybe throw in a little less bleak Nick Drake too. This album was recorded in a cabin in Northern Wisconsin in the Winter and I think the music made shows that. We are in the middle of a long winter right now in Wisconsin and this album is a good soundtrack to play while I walk through the slush and try not to slip on the ice.
1881273156|5.0|This book is great and easy to read.  Stories are encourage and easy for us to relate to.  We see ourselves in those stories.  The concepts are easy to grasp and very applicable to any relationship.  The ideas are not only for marriage but for children as well.  My wife and I love it and help us to develop more discussion topics.  Discussion questions for this book is available for online.  They are helpful in group setting.
B00109T5WY|5.0|If you liked their first album run right out and buy this now.  It is Deep and Inspiring and BEAUTIFUL!!!  I can't believe everyone else has only given it 4 stars.  This album has power and intensity with an added dose of peace and introspection that you only dream of other post rock bands achieving all in one package.  Imagine the gentleness and beauty of Sigur Ros meeting the intensity and power of Mono with a magical middle ground and slow build that most post rock bands never seem to be able to find.    I LOVE THIS BAND!  And I think you will too.
B000R7I3LY|2.0|Sara Bareilles (along with Colbie Caillat, Ingrid Michaelson and Kate Voegle) have been heavily promoted by VH1 as \\"sophisticated, thoughtful\\" singer/songwriters. Deservedly, these women have been somewhat pooled together as far as the marketing aspect goes--what I find that they all have in common is accessible (but entirely forgettable) styles of writing, and average, nondescript pleasant voices. I understand the music industry has waves and cycles--consider these girls post-post Lilith Fair fare. Sadly, though, none of these artists have the vocal chops and writing skills of Sarah McLachlan, Tori Amos, or Fiona Apple (all of whom have survived the chick/folk/alt. wave of the mid/late 90s--and for good reason). In a year or two, none this new crowd will be remembered. May I recommend some female artists that ARE making music that stands out:  Imogen Heap, Goldfrapp, Kosheen, Thea Gilmore, Zoe Johnston, and Carla Werner.  Just take a listen and you will see what I mean...

B000005L86|5.0|As everyone else has pointed out, this is a must have roots reggae album.  Don't settle for any version however, make certian to get this Blood and Fire package.  The remastering is sublime, the bonus tracks are on a seperate disk so they don't tart up the original sequencing and the text and photos are great.  If you settle for the download version you will be missing something wonderful, get this package before it goes out of print for good.
031237593X|5.0|What a wonderful book! I know a book is great when I am sorry it has to end.<br /><br />It is always a relief to find historical fiction that is not only historically accurate but also tells a great story.  Very well written and entertaining.<br /><br />Of course, Penman creates personalities and motives and conversations; that is the definition of fiction. But she does it well within the bounds of the facts.  You may disagree with her, and that's okay, because she will make you think about why you disagree with her.  I love fiction that makes me think and makes me want to learn more about the characters and their lives.<br /><br />A notable point about Penman is that she does have historical \\"sense.\\"  Her characters exist in their time, not ours.  That is so often not the case in historical fiction (the dreaded Philippa Gregory comes to mind!).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B00009RDG9|4.0|**** 2003. Directed by William Friedkin. Four years before [[ASIN:B000T5O48K Bug (Special Edition)]], his last film to date, Friedkin, in THE HUNTED, already took an interest in the case of a soldier suffering from a mental disorder. But when one knows that it was his teacher/father who had the duty to stop him, the movie acquires a very interesting dimension. Recommended.
0061139378|5.0|What a great, creepy story! And what a great heroine who keeps her head amongst all sorts of madness, and displays bravery even when she doesn't want to. I think the book is also written in a matter of fact way children retell storys, not too wordy, not overthinking things. Fantastic.
B00104QSOM|5.0|My friend and I saw this movie two weeks ago, and we still cannot stop talking about it. It was indeed raw, primal, and haunting. Movie making at it's best.
B00129XQ0O|5.0|Celtic frost is one of the forefathers of Death metal and argueably the best band ever. If you are looking at this then you probably already know that. Even though there is a good reason most of these songs were never officially released it is a great moment in time marking the beginnings of a fledgling yet uniquely heavy band. If you haven't heard these demos yet then you owe it to yourself and to Grave Violator to hear this mostly forget classic. Celtic Frost dared where most bands would break down. I can only pray they put out another new studio album. The world needs them.
B0013FBTHO|5.0|This is a great movie and I'm excited that its coming to HDDVD. I will update my review on the PQ and AQ of this HDDVD after I recieve it.
B000W0DFDM|1.0|I'm halfway through this book, and wish I hadn't wasted my money. Greg's \\"ideal man\\" is one that calls 10 times a day, wants to spend every waking moment with you, and wants to tag along on Girl's night out and shopping trips. That's not a boyfriend, that's a stalker. In fact, I had one of those guys once, and now have a restraining order against him. Women enjoy a challenge too. Anyone who dotes on me as much as the author says he should, I would assume he is emotionally needy and has no life. Total turn-off, sorry. Don't buy this book, buy \\"Why Hasn't He Called\\", much more realistic.
1400049628|5.0|I keep this book in the car for when I am stuck waiting in it, or in an office (it does draw interesting looks). I absolutely love it. It is written with such a dead pan, intensive urgency that I find myself comparing \\"Zombie combative weapons\\" and really, really giving thought to which ones I would pack in my arsenal, weighing the fire power vs weight,  blunt weapons versatility as tools also, etc. A GREAT momentary escape from reality.
B000TSIK14|5.0|I haven't  had this much fun listening to a rock album in a LONG TIME.  \\"Humanity Hour 1\\" ROCKS and is by far The Scorps  best album EVER!!! Teaming up with song writer Desmond Child, who pushed the scorpions to greatness.  My favorite Tracks are \\"Hour 1\\"- This song blew me away the first time I heard it!   \\"The game of live\\" a killer rock song with lyrics that will get stuck in your head for days. \\"the Cross\\" is another great rock track, featuring Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins. If Radio refuses to play any new tracks off this album than I have given up on radio, because this album is classic.  If you are a scorpions fan, do not miss out on this album, IT IS AWESOME!
B0014BC3C2|3.0|Timely movie that questions whether it's right/just to torture terror suspects.  But it's very one sided.  Should have made it a little more balanced.  Also, the story line is a little too unbelievable.
B000ZFI1GK|3.0|I purchased this \\"Limited Collectors Version\\" at Wal-Mart for less than $15 including tax.  I've listened to it many times and can honestly say there are perhaps half a dozen good (not great) songs here.  This really should have been a single disc.  It's nice that The Eagles are still around performing together, but the creativity of \\"Desperado\\" and \\"Hotel California\\" are now long gone.
0143038419|3.0|I actually liked this book quite a lot.  I believe that the other reviewer's expectations were too high (or misdirected).  The title alone, I think, lets one know not to expect a serious, introspective or overly insightful look at anything.  It is supposed to be somewhat glib!  For someone seeking a funny, wistful, travel-journal, I would recommend this book.  It inspired me to travel more, seek new adventures, visit Italy (I loved the antectdotes from her travels there), and I even pulled out my old Buddhist meditation book for the fun of it.  And I guess that is the bottom line.  It is a fun book (ok, the divorce stuff was not terribly pleasant, but it is important for one to understand the author's state of mind).  The ashram stay was very interesting to me, as a novice.  I just had to write a positive review of this book because I was surprized to see that the others were so very negative!  I think it is worth reading; just don't expect to have a transcendental awakening - that's just not what this book is about!
B001209SMS|5.0|Although critics have been almost unanimous in their praise of this film, many fans of the show are quite harsh in their appraisal, chiefly for two reasons - one, that the principals are not great singers, and two, the deletion of roughly 50% of the score.  I surprised myself in that, having purchased the soundtrack and seen the movie, I am in neither camp, as either of these factors might heretofore have caused me to pronounce most film adaptations of almost any Broadway musical a failure.  Instead, I am thrilled far beyond my expectations with this production.<br /><br />It might not have been so, had I not had so much respect for Stephen Sondheim.  As part of the pre-release publicity, he has granted an unusual (for him) number of interviews, and says that he is unequivocally satisfied with Tim Burton's vision.  As anyone who appreciates his high level of artistic integrity will agree, Mr. Sondheim would not give praise to this project if he were not satisfied with it.  At 77, Stephen Sondheim is considered by many to be the greatest composer in the history of the American theatre, and I have followed him long enough to know that no amount of financial consideration could cause him to declare his endorsement if he were not truly happy with the finished film.<br /><br />I have listened carefully to what Mr. Sondheim has had to say in those recent interviews, and now understand why so many stage musicals previously transferred to celluloid haven't worked.  To begin with, time passes very differently in a theatre than it does on film.  That which takes several minutes in a Broadway theatre (i.e. a full-blown production number) is apt to seem like a small eternity on screen.  Therefore, the very thing that keeps most audiences clamoring for more in live theatre is apt to make many movie audiences run screaming from the auditorium.  Then there is the problem of what Alfred Hitchcock once termed \\"suspension of disbelief\\"; that is, in real life, no one ever bursts into song during one of life's dramatic moments, no less accompanied by a full orchestra, and many moviegoers who are accustomed to a certain amount of reality therefore find musical films particularly hard to take.  Thanks to some of the theories on musical film recently voiced by Mr. Sondheim, I finally understand why so many previous attempts to film Broadway musicals fall flat - in short, the theatre and film are two entirely different mediums, with two entirely different audiences.  Although many theatre lovers, myself included, would be happy to sit through an entire musical transferred to screen exactly as produced on stage, most movie audiences demand something different.  And something different is what they surely get with Sweeney Todd.<br /><br />Then there is the score.  Tim Burton has said that he has been a fan of Sweeney Todd since its original run.  I believe that, as disappointing as it is for many fans to accept how much of the score has been cut, it was probably even more agonizing for Mr. Burton to decide what pieces to remove.  The original ran over three hours, and at least 75% of the story was sung, making Sweeney Todd one of the few genuine operas to ever come out of Broadway.  The film runs only 117 minutes and, judging by the length of the soundtrack CD (a mere 72 minutes) easily 40% of the score has been removed, chiefly the ensemble pieces.  Mr. Burton apparently judged (probably correctly) that the choral numbers which worked so well on stage, although containing some of the wittiest lyrics, would be clunky and ponderous on film, and he made the prudent (if, I'm sure, difficult) decision to let them go.  This is likely to be the sorest point for many fans of the show.  And had I not been paying careful attention to Mr. Sondheim's recent interviews, I may not have been able to get past that point myself.<br /><br />But what has been excised is more than compensated for in Mr. Burton's sumptuous visuals and careful attention to detail.  Although Mr. Sondheim has made changes to the lyrics, resolving previously problematic portions of the score and actually improving it, it's amazing how much of what is left of the score is faithful to the original.  Though it's a tragic story, Sweeney Todd remains in essence a dark comedy, and many of Mr. Burton's finer touches, especially the staging of the musical numbers, have enhanced the story to the point where I have hardly missed the deletions, and I speak as someone who has loved this piece in almost all of its previous renderings.<br /><br />And I admit that, although he has never been a particular favorite of mine, Johnny Depp is a revelation.  Without detracting from previous interpreters of the role (especially Len Cariou and George Hearn), Mr. Depp's evocation of the character is so fully fleshed out, and so filled with genuine pathos and sympathy, that I was able to immediately excuse the fact that he is not a seasoned vocalist.  Besides, to reiterate a point made earlier, this is not Broadway, and there is no need for his voice to reach the back of the house.  If anything, the fact that the principal characters are not great singers actually enhances the realistic feel of the film.  It is also a pleasure to have both Toby and Anthony (not to mention Joanna) played by actors of the appropriate age, and hear accents that actually invoke pre-Victorian London.<br /><br />In the end however, the real star (to me, anyway) is the superlative score by Stephen Sondheim.  I am not amazed that some feel that there are no \\"memorable songs\\" in the score.  Good music should be subtle; the absence of \\"catchy tunes\\" that one will whistle on the way out of the theatre is only indicative to me of the high quality of the score.  Anyone who is previously unfamiliar with Sweeney Todd who doesn't \\"get it\\" is urged to purchase the soundtrack (the full version, with the complete libretto included) and follow along with the words and music as the songs are sung.  The first thing you will realize is (as with any of Mr. Sondheim's works, whether they be in a film, the theatre, or any other medium) how incredibly witty and sophisticated his lyrics are; on first listen you are apt to miss most of his delicious wit.  His use of the English language, his clever rhymes, and above all, his intelligent, deft semantics will amaze anyone who cares to take the time to listen.  There are reasons why so many consider Sondheim the foremost composer of the theatre, and so many intelligent theatergoers hang on his every word.  But just as important as his words (and I have always admired Sondheim's ability to use words above all else that I treasure in the world of musical theatre), you will find, especially if you listen long and hard enough, that his delicate, subtle music will, in time, work its way into your heart and conscience as some of the most beautiful music ever composed.  This is NOT top-forty pop music, the type that is so often mistaken for excellence in theatre these days.  In his ballads especially, Sondheim writes genuine, heartfelt gorgeous melodies; that is, real music.  Once you open your heart and mind to Sondheim's glorious words and sumptuous airs, you may just become a fan for life.eim has made changes to the lyrics, resolving previously problematic portions of the score and actually improving it, it's amazing how much of what is left of the score is faithful to the original.  Though it's a tragic story, Sweeney Todd remains in essence a dark comedy, and many of Mr. Burton's finer touches, especially the staging of the musical numbers, have enhanced the story to the point where I have hardly missed the deletions, and I speak as someone who has loved this piece in almost all of its previous renderings.     And I admit that, although he has never been a particular favorite of mine, Johnny Depp is a revelation.  Without detracting from previous interpreters of the role (especially Len Cariou and George Hearn), Mr. Depp's evocation of the character is so fully fleshed out, and so filled with genuine pathos and sympathy, that I was able to immediately excuse the fact that he is not a seasoned vocalist.  Besides, to reiterate a point made earlier, this is not Broadway, and there is no need for his voice to reach the back of the house.  If anything, the fact that the principal characters are not great singers actually enhances the realistic feel of the film.  It is also a pleasure to have both Toby and Anthony (not to mention Joanna) played by actors of the appropriate age, and hear accents that actually invoke pre-Victorian London.          In the end however, the real star (to me, anyway) is the superlative score by Stephen Sondheim.  I am not amazed that some feel that there are no \\"memorable songs\\" in the score.  Good music should be subtle; the absence of \\"catchy tunes\\" that one will whistle on the way out of the theatre is only indicative to me of the high quality of the score.  Anyone who is previously unfamiliar with Sweeney Todd who doesn't \\"get it\\" is urged to purchase the soundtrack (the full version, with the complete libretto included) and follow along with the words and music as the songs are sung.  The first thing you will realize is (as with any of Mr. Sondheim's works, whether they be in a film, the theatre, or any other medium) how incredibly witty and sophisticated his lyrics are; on first listen you are apt to miss most of his delicious wit.  His use of the English language, his clever rhymes, and above all, his intelligent, deft semantics will amaze anyone who cares to take the time to listen.  There are reasons why so many consider Sondheim the foremost composer of the theatre, and so many intelligent theatergoers hang on his every word.  But just as important as his words (and I have always admired Sondheim's ability to use words above all else that I treasure in the world of musical theatre), you will find, especially if you listen long and hard enough, that his delicate, subtle music will, in time, work its way into your heart and conscience as some of the most beautiful music ever composed.  This is NOT top-forty pop music, the type that is so often mistaken for excellence in theatre these days.  In his ballads especially, Sondheim writes genuine, heartfelt gorgeous melodies; that is, real music.  Once you open your heart and mind to Sondheim's glorious words and sumptuous airs, you may just become a fan for life.
B000SSGUEO|5.0|Alright folks, this is it: after almost 6 months of agonizing wait, I finally got my hands on this CD, and I must say that I'm enjoying every second of it (I'm listening to it as I write this review). When most people think of Deep Purple, they automatically think of the Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Paice and Jon Lord Mk II lineup. Other lineups are often overlooked regardless of the fact that they have produced some great music. Did it have the same impact as the Mk II output? Maybe not, but music should not be judged by record sales, or even airplay on classic rock radio.<br /><br />Why do I bring this up? Because there are quite a few people out there who believe that there is an excess of live albums by Deep Purple, and more specifically, from the Mk III lineup that included David Coverdale (lead vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals) replacing Gillan and Glover respectively. So, I've heard and seen quite a few comments saying that releases such as this one are \\"redundant\\" or \\"pointless\\". I disagree: first, `cos live albums are a different entity, totally different from studio albums re-releases and/or compilations; second, because no 2 concerts from Deep Purple were EVER alike; and third `cos while it might be true that there are several Mk III live releases already available, none of them managed to fully capture the fire of one of their shows. For the sake of thoroughness, lets briefly examine each and every one of those releases, shall we?<br /><br />- Live at the California Jam: probably the most (in)famous of them all, in no small part due to the almost legendary status of that show, which saw the band co-headline the event with EL&P, playing in front of a few hundred thousand people and being televised to a few million more (just a few...). And of course, let us not forget Blackmore's antics (TV camera trashing, guitar bashing, amp blowing, etc...). The show was killer, yes, but what of the resulting album? It was lackluster, maybe because it is not quite the same to hear a guitar being ripped as it is to see it, but mostly because of its sound: the show suffered technical difficulties with the mixing of the band's sound, the guitar being almost imperceptible during opening number \\"Burn\\" and then gradually gaining volume. Successive re-releases of the same recording with different names (Live at the Ontario Speedway '74, California Jamming, etc) have attempted to improve sound quality, but since the problem is in the source tape, not much can actually be done. And in addition to that, most releases were missing a full song, \\"Lay Down, Stay Down\\" due to time constraints.<br /><br />- Perks and Tit/ Live in San Diego '74: a great quality soundboard recording (meaning that it was made by the band's sound engineers as part of their tasks, in order to create and \\"sound log\\" to fine tune settings while on tour) taken from a show just a few days after the aforementioned Cal Jam. Many fans in attendance to both shows feel that this one is the better show of the 2. Problem is, it wasn't recorded in full: the tape stopped rolling during Jon Lord's solo, and therefore left 2 songs, namely \\"You Fool No One\\" and \\"Space Truckin\\" out.<br /><br />- Made in Europe: recorded during the final shows Blackmore did with the band (before jumping ship to Rainbow) at the end of the European tour in support of \\"Stormbringer\\" in early 1975 and released after the final split of the band in 1976, after the Tommy Bolin experiment had gone wrong. Four shows were taped, and yet the bulk of the album was taken from a single show, which was greatly edited to include songs by this lineup only, leaving out roughly half of the band's set. And while no one had ever gone on record to publicly admit it, many fans suspected that the album featured extensive studio doctoring, if not flat out re-recording. Another disappointment.<br /><br />- Mk III The Final Concerts/Live in Paris 1975: after almost 30 years, the tapes from the last concerts of that last Mk III tour were dusted off and released. The bulk of the material came from the very final show in Paris on April 7, 1975. Throughout the show, the inner band tension is evident, with mistakes frequently popping up. The band was on the verge of breakup, relationships strained at best by Blackmore's detachment. Most definitely, not the best of times to record a live album.<br /><br />And so, once again, the good folks at the DPAS (Deep Purple Appreciation Society) took it upon themselves to right those wrongs, and up they went to track down the tapes of a concert recorded by the BBC at the Gaumont State in Kilburn, London on May 22, 1974 during the band's sole British tour. The show had in fact been available for years in bootlegging circles, and Purple's Japanese label even released it over there, but once again editing out closing number \\"Space Truckin\\". A few years ago they re-released it, this time including an edited version of \\"Space Truckin\\", and one could fetch that release by parting of some fifty odd dollars or so. Until the DPAS came to the rescue! And thankfully so, `cos this is, without a doubt, the best live document available of this lineup of the band. It ain't perfect, but what TRUE concert album is, anyway?<br /><br />So yeah, you have to pay more `cos it's an import CD, but it is really worth it. This release features the show in full on 2 CD's, unedited, with a clear sound. I personally think that it could have (should have?) been mastered a little louder, but...it's ok, I guess, might as well give my neighbors a little respite. The show is awesome from beginning to end, and a treat for Mk III diehards such as myself. Disc one starts with the classic \\"Burn\\", and this has got to be the best live version I've heard of this song yet: fast, furious, with LOTS of great soloing and a punchy sound; \\"Might Just take you life\\" is a somewhat odd number to follow such an auspicious start, but the band manages to make it work brilliantly; next comes one of my favorites from the Burn album, \\"Lay Down, Stay Down\\", in a fast version that allows great interplay between David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes on vocals, great drumming by Ian Paice and more terrific soloing from Blackmore.<br /><br />Epic \\"Mistreated\\" is pure genius, but I must warn you, it suffers from some sound problems: after the solo, David seems to have had some problem with his mike `cos he sounds very low, and then, for some reason, during the outro of the song, the volume of the guitar gradually lowers, which is a shame `cos there's some great work being done by Ritchie; still, all that being said, the song is great, especially `cos the band as a whole really invests itself as a whole to make the most of the tune. That's especially true for Glenn bass playing: at this point he really stays true to the original arrangement from the studio version, as opposed to later embellishments that he would add to the song on subsequent tours, funky slaps and such. Now, don't get me wrong: I love Glenn's funky playing, but I also believe that there is a right time and a right place for everything, and a classic such as \\"Mistreated\\" is DEFINITELY not the right place for funky bass slaps as far as I'm concerned...but I'm sure many of you will disagree with me...it's a matter of taste, really. And although I love this live version, it is still a notch below their Cal Jam performance, which is the best ever live version of the tune as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />After a short introduction of the band members by Jon Lord we're back into familiar territory with the band's take on their earlier classic \\"Smoke on the Water\\"; now, I know many of you are purist who feel that this is a Gillan song and that no one else but him should sing it; I hear you, and in a small way I sorta go along with that, but to be honest, I really like the arrangement that the band came up with, although I'll never understand why is it that they replaced the lyrics of the thirdverse with those of the first...oh well...<br /><br />We're off to CD number 2, which oddly enough contains only 2 tracks, but what 2 tracks those are: the extended versions of \\"You Fool No One\\" and \\"Space Truckin\\", which amount to an insignificant 50 minutes of total madness. The former is perfect, another one of the great tracks from \\"Burn\\" and live, it was used as a showcase number for Ian Paice and Ritchie Blackmore, who freely indulge into lengthy solos where they really raise hell; additionally, the tune also features some more of the exuberance of the Coverdale/Hughes vocal tandem. Awesome! This is my favorite feature of the Mk III, and I still believe that, after all has been said and done, no other Purple lineup could equal this one in sheer musical potential, live or in the studio.<br /><br />Jon Lord enthusiasts fear not: he gets plenty of room to shine on final number \\"Space Truckin\\", which all in all, is a bit of a let down for me: very similar in length and performance to the version available on the Cal Jam release, it's one of the songs that, at least for me, has never quite done it for me in the live context. See, the studio version is one of my favorite Purple songs, and that's because it is fast, heavy and to the point. Jon Lord's distorted organ riff is such an integral part of that equation, and when trying to translate that to the live context, without the distortion...I don't know, it just doesn't do it for me...that being said, there is really a lot of great interplay between the band members here, as they get to jam extensively, connecting with bits and pieces of other songs that pop up here and there, such as \\"Mandrake Root\\", \\"Child in Time\\" and believe it or not...even a bit of \\"Still am Sad\\"!!! Echoes of things to come...?<br /><br />Under normal conditions, the band would have encored with either a cover of \\"Going Down\\" or their earlier hit \\"Highway Star\\". For years, it was assumed that the BBC simple didn't record or lost the encore number, but through interviews with fans in attendance and some research, it was confirmed that, unfortunately for all of us, there was no encore at the show, the band being slightly miffed by the fact that the audience seemed a bit unresponsive...but what could you expect, when they were forced to remain seated on their chairs by the venue's bouncers? Anyway...<br /><br />Bottom Line: my actual rating for this release would be no less than 4 ½ stars, mostly because of the of the relatively low volume of the mastering, the lack of encore, the sound problems during \\"Mistreated\\" and the lack of real punch during \\"Space Truckin\\". But if you're a Mk III aficionado, you need to get this, plain and simple. And if you're not...maybe this is the CD you need to make you change your mind. Casual fans be warned: only 2 songs from the Mk II era are included here, one of them in a \\"super-duper-mega\\" extended ½ hour version that is not suited for everyone...but if you're sure you can stomach it, then please, do yourself a favor and get this double release. It is the definitive Mk III live document, and no fan of this configuration of the band should do without it.ay Down, Stay Down\\", in a fast version that allows great interplay between David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes on vocals, great drumming by Ian Paice and more terrific soloing from Blackmore.

B000000XCD|5.0|[[VIDEOID:18541911]]I can't add anything to the 5 star reviews except to demo how good \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" is for JumpRock. I wish I could give it an 8 to offset the three 4 star reviews, none of which give a reason for the downgrade. It's not that I'm obsessive, it's just that I care about justice so very, very, very much - especially for millionare (I assume) rock and rollers like CCR - and good on 'em.
B0012QE4OO|3.0|It has an interesting idea. Some people can teleport by just thinking about it! They don't need any special equipment! The special effects are spectacular. However, the fighting scenes flashes so quickly it's hard to see. There's a big twist at the end when the main character found out who was one of his enemies.    It's worth watching once for curiosity.

After a short introduction of the band members by Jon Lord we're back into familiar territory with the band's take on their earlier classic \\"Smoke on the Water\\"; now, I know many of you are purist who feel that this is a Gillan song and that no one else but him should sing it; I hear you, and in a small way I sorta go along with that, but to be honest, I really like the arrangement that the band came up with, although I'll never understand why is it that they replaced the lyrics of the third verse with those of the first...oh well...    We're off to CD number 2, which oddly enough contains only 2 tracks, but what 2 tracks those are: the extended versions of \\"You Fool No One\\" and \\"Space Truckin\\", which amount to an insignificant 50 minutes of total madness. The former is perfect, another one of the great tracks from \\"Burn\\" and live, it was used as a showcase number for Ian Paice and Ritchie Blackmore, who freely indulge into lengthy solos where they really raise hell; additionally, the tune also features some more of the exuberance of the Coverdale/Hughes vocal tandem. Awesome! This is my favorite feature of the Mk III, and I still believe that, after all has been said and done, no other Purple lineup could equal this one in sheer musical potential, live or in the studio.     Jon Lord enthusiasts fear not: he gets plenty of room to shine on final number \\"Space Truckin\\", which all in all, is a bit of a let down for me: very similar in length and performance to the version available on the Cal Jam release, it is one of the songs that, at least for me, has never quite done it for me in the live context. See, the studio version is one of my favorite Purple songs, and that's because it is fast, heavy and to the point. Jon Lord's distorted organ riff is such an integral part of that equation, and when trying to translate that to the live context, without the distortion...I don't know, it just doesn't do it for me...that being said, there is really a lot of great interplay between the band members here, as they get to jam extensively, connecting with bits and pieces of other songs that pop up here and there, such as \\"Mandrake Root\\", \\"Child in Time\\" and believe it or not...even a bit of \\"Still am Sad\\"!!! Echoes of things to come...?    Under normal conditions, the band would have encored with either a cover of \\"Going Down\\" or their earlier hit \\"Highway Star\\". For years, it was assumed that the BBC simple didn't record or lost the encore number, but through interviews with fans in attendance and some research, it was confirmed that, unfortunately for all of us, there was no encore at the show, the band being slightly miffed by the fact that the audience seemed a bit unresponsive...but what could you expect, when they were forced to remain seated on their chairs by the venue's bouncers? Anyway...    Bottom Line: my actual rating for this release would be no less than 4 ½ stars, mostly because of the relatively low volume of the mastering, the  lack of encore, the sound problems during \\"Mistreated\\" and the lack of real punch during \\"Space Truckin\\". If you're a Mk III aficionado, you need to get this, plain and simple. And if you're not...maybe this is the CD you need to make you change your mind. Casual fans be warned: only 2 songs from the Mk II era are included here, one of them in a \\"super-duper-mega\\" extended ½ hour version that is not suited for everyone...but if you're sure you can stomach it, then please, do yourself a favor and get this double release. It is the definitive Mk III live document, and no fan of this configuration of the band should do without it.
006135323X|5.0|Like a few of the other reviewers I took Dan's class at Duke's Fuqua School of Business.  While it was a class assignment to read a chapter of the book per week, I completed it within a few days because it was such a great read.  It's one of those books that makes you want to poke your airplane seat neighbor and say \\"hey check this out!\\". You'll learn why companies have some really odd pricing schemes and you'll be very surprised at some of the research studies Dan used to gather information.  In class and through his book Dan constantly surprised me with the fact that he knows a little something about everything and someone everywhere. How many other former MIT guys hang around with Grateful Dead lyricists?  A great book for business people, students, and basically everyone.
1592332803|5.0|Finally a  full vegan baking cookbook that a new vegan can use to transition into the vegan lifestyle. This is one the most beautiful vegan baking cookbooks I have ever seen. I forgot that I was perusing a vegan baking cookbook because all the photographs reminded me of any one of the non-vegan colorful cookbooks. The glossy pages and enticing photographs called me to the kitchen. This is truly a good beginning for an amazing journey of easy, fun vegan baking for everyday common baked goods.    There is a great mix of recipes that every new and not so new vegan/vegetarian wishes to eat, yet are hard pressed to find. Most of the time a massive search in a variety of sources would be the norm just to find a non-vegan favorite in vegan form. I love hoe the recipes are laid out in such a way that you can most nearly see how easy it can be to make straight substitutions in non vegan recipes. Vegan and non-vegan ingredients are explained, as well as different hints and tips are given.    Colleen Patrick-Goudreau gives an excellent introduction into her world and the world of a vegan lifestyle. I also loved how she opens herself to share her journey in detail, while empowering others through knowledge about what goes into their bodies. It is refreshing to experience someone so passionate and compassionate about this way of life. I look forward with a fork, spoon and napkin for the next cookbook arrival from Ms. Goudreau. Happy Tasting!
B00069YE0W|5.0|`Curtains' was the last in Frusciante's six releases in six months.  I don't know if the title was intentionally fitting but pulling the `Curtains' on the six releases, is very appropriate; whether it was intended or not!  The album is predominantly chilled out, slow-paced, acoustic songs bursting with passion and tenderness at the same time.      On first listen to this album, I reckon some people would just throw this away as just another slow, boring acoustic record.  Especially as most Frusciante fans are Chili fans who are familiar with Frusciante's funk, rock guitar playing with the Chili's or the fuller sounding solo Frusciante which encompasses a whole range of instruments and sounds.  But you have to remember this is John Frusciante.  Has anything he has ever done been ordinary?  This is an album where once again, Frusciante pushes the boundaries of acoustic music, just like he has done with other genres in every other album he has made.  Whether you think they were good or not; is not the point. He is always striving to be a better musician and I feel the majority of albums he has pushed the boundaries of not just his music but also pushed the standards set by other bands in the genres he has delved into.      The album kicks off with `Past Recedes' which is a great opener, as it has a nice warm, summery feeling to it.  This is probably the most accessible song on the album, due to its simplicity as if he is breaking listeners in gently.  The acoustic guitar chirps along while Frusciante's vocals come in with `1, 2, 3, 4 and then the past recedes'. Then about half way through the mouth organ comes in and makes a good song even better. I have always been a big fan of mouth organs as I feel the instrument releases good positive feeling sound which is very appropriate for this song.    After the initial track, as previously mentioned, it all feels like he is re-writing the acoustic song book.  The way the songs are constructed and delivered are once again a testament to his imagination and the sheer talent he possesses.  One of the tricks he uses in `Anne' and `Control' is to use silence.  Now I know what I would be thinking when reading this. That bands do this all the time; for example Biffy Clyro. Where they have really quiet parts then suddenly go really loud.  This is not like that at all. The silence is used in a different way because the purpose is not to make the listener spill their coffee as they jump out their seat.  The silence in this case is like it is an instrument in itself.  At first I was sceptical, as these songs just feel like they are stopping then starting again a few seconds later.  But when you listen to the lyrics and the songs as a whole it really does work.   So much so these are now my favourite songs on the album.  They are invigorating and are just a couple of examples on the album of how Frusciante keeps his music fresh and different from what is out there at the moment.    Overall I feel Curtains is fitting way to end the series of releases.  Not only because of the style of music but also the quality of it is reminiscent of the standards set through the rest of the albums he has released in 2004.  Some may not have been as good as others, but with different styles, it's always going to be the case that people have preferences over the albums.  But overall the standard has been very high.  On the whole `Curtains' is a great album to relax to before you go to bed as it is never in a rush and is full of breathtaking music.
B000062X90|5.0|Argus is a classic *must own* rock album released in 1972.  It's a flawless record, with some of the greatest guitar playing ever put on tape.  Yes, I've heard all the legendary greats- Eric Clapton, Santana, John McLaughlin, Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour, Keith Richards, Pete Townshend, etc.  Ted Turner and Andy Powell from Wishbone Ash are JUST as good as all the ones I mention above.    Argus is an album that was popular for a very brief time in the early 70's (in America) before eventually slipping away from peoples memories.  That is, until now.  *I* don't forget about classic rock albums no matter HOW many years go by.    The best way to describe the sound would be picturing Crosby, Stills and Nash joining the Allman Brothers Band and releasing an album together.  You have the extraordinary vocals of the former, and the brilliant guitar playing of the latter.  Now, I am NOT calling the members of Wishbone Ash ripoffs of those bands.  NO WAY would I say that.  They are simply able to take the sound and style of two extraordinary bands, mix them together, and make it work perfectly.  Seriously, the word \\"perfect\\" gets tossed around a lot, but in this case, I honestly can't find a single flaw with this record.      You know one thing that's a personal memory for me about the album is how it reminds me of when I was a child and would constantly play this one old Nintendo game over and over called \\"Wizards and Warriors\\".  Take the theme of that game and match it with the music from this Wishbone Ash album, and you will find the two connect together REALLY well.  I love the memories of that video game, and years from now, I will hold on to the memories of this album.    I can't imagine a more spectacular sound and style than the ones these guys had for \\"Argus\\".  It's just... amazing to me!      \\"Time Was\\" starts off slowly and quietly with *very* soft vocals that gradually build into a very likeable 70's rock song.  I love it.  Overlong?  Nah, not really.  It's 10 minutes that seem to go by in a hurry because of its easy-to-please style.  Really, it's a great song.  \\"Sometime World\\" is the first track that reveals just how talented the two guitarists for Wishbone Ash are.  Their ability to switch between mellow and memorable notes and go directly into fast and exciting is unbelievable!      The guitar playing always seems to flow beautifully with the vocal melodies, on every single occasion, and that's just flat out *awesome* if you ask me.  It's *not* guitar work taking place just for the sake of having a guitar player at the right moment- it's like those two guitarists BELONG with the band, and without them, the other band members would feel like they're missing something.  Oh sure, the singing and songwriting would still be quite strong, but the guitar playing is too extraordinary to overlook.    \\"Blowin' Free\\" reminds me of the Crosby, Stills and Nash classic \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" with the vocal melodies, and the main verse melody in particular sounds like \\"Woman\\", the Sugarloaf song (the same band that did \\"Green-Eyed Lady\\" a couple years earlier).  The guitar playing that you hear in the introduction is truly magnificent, and in fact, the entire track is just as memorable and exciting.      \\"The King Will Come\\" has a marching feel in the beginning that leads into some more very satisfying guitar work.  I can't say enough about that guitar playing.  It's just perfect.  \\"Leaf and Stream\\" is mellow in a Dire Straits kinda way.  This time we find out the guitarists have a talent for soft and quiet tunes, because their guitar work here is pleasant, emotional, and yes, nearly as perfect as a man (men) can possibly play an instrument.  It *will* move you.    \\"Warrior\\" and \\"Throw Down the Sword\\" both sound a good 10 years ahead of their time.  The demanding and catchy guitar style in the beginning of \\"Throw Down the Sword\\" is especially incredible.  Once again, the memories of that old NES game \\"Wizards and Warriors\\" comes intoplay here.  I love both of these songs a lot, but I can honestly see someone complaining about the chorus in \\"Warrior\\" sounding cheesy.  Maybe it does, but I don't care- these guys are WAY too talented for me to complain about one minute of awkwardness.      If your version comes with a song called \\"No Easy Road\\", it's just a glammy rock song with lots of energy, similar to something Mott the Hoople would do a couple years later.  I love it, but it's probably the weakest point on the album.      Overall, yes, a brilliant, brilliant masterpiece.  Argus is truly a fantastic rock album.  If you're not blown away by that guitar playing, you're not human!!
5555290314|5.0|Take a melancholy stroll down memory lane of one of the most memorable romances in screen history. It's a story and a study of the attraction of opposites, the love that binds, and the differences that tear us apart. This is a film for anyone who has loved and lost but it is the journey that is unforgettable. The musical score is truly phenomenal. Enjoy!
B000RZIGZ4|4.0|I am a HUGE Top Gun fan.  I own the first DVD version and the Special Edition DVD versions of this movie.  My obsession forced me to buy the HD-DVD version too.  I wasn't expecting anything jaw dropping from the video quality but I was drooling over the audio tracks on the HD-DVD version (note that it comes with TrueHD and DD-plus tracks).      The HD-DVD has pretty much no extras so if you want the movie with some cool extras, get the Special Edition DVD.  It has music videos (including Berlin and Harold Faltermeyer's Top Gun Theme Song...great 80's throwbacks) and some interesting info on how they made the movie.  And if you have money to burn buy the HD-DVD version for the sweet sound.    The image quality is better than the DVD(s) but not too much better.  Some of the aerial scenes look about as good as the DVD version, but they were dealing with plane mounted 1980s camera source material.      The sound quality of the HD-DVD is superb, as I have stated.  Even if you don't have a TrueHD decoding HD-DVD player or receiver, just set it to that track anyway and see how awesome it is.  And do yourself a favor and crank it up, watching this movie at a low volume is an injustice.
B0013FBS20|5.0|I think this was a GREAT movie to close out the year with. This movie had everything...action, suspense great story and even though Will Smith was the a lone actor...still did a great job acting in it. Besides 300 I think this is definetly one of the best movies of 2007. You definetly must buy this and it must be Blu-Ray because everything else just sucks!!    GO BLU-RAY!!!---Glad to see you won the war over HD DVD
