B000002UJQ|5.0|This is quite simply one of the most ambitious albums of the 90's.  Okay, I'll go a step further and say it's one of most ambitious albums of all time.  The best way to describe this album is to say that after listening to it, everything sounds ancient in comparison.  This is music of the future, pre-packaged and ready to listen in the present. <br />Everything about this album is out of this world.  The front cover describes it best.  What are these weird images you see on the cover?  What is it supposed to symbolise?  After a few listens to the album, you'll find yourself asking the same questions about the music. <br />This is hardly easy listening music.  It takes many listens to appreciate it for what it is.  The first time I listened to it, the only song that appealed to me was the depressing &quot;No surprises&quot;.  Now the whole album sounds like a beautiful masterpiece. <br />Despite my enjoyment of this album, I also find it one of the most overrated albums of all time.  I've seen it come first in a few &quot;greatest albums of all time&quot; polls.  Despite its brilliance, I can't see how this album (released in 1997) can possibly be considered the greatest album of all time, when albums like the white album by the Beatles still endure after 30 years. <br />Alright back to the album I am reviewing :-). <br />In summary, give yourself a few minutes to recover after you finish listening to this album.  It would be unfair to listen to anything soon after because it will sound simplistic and ancient next to this futuristic, mind-blowing sound.

B0000004V2|5.0|I'm a confessed CD-a-holic.  Even when I've run out of CD's to purchase, I'll take a risk and buy a CD of a band I've never heard before.  Silly?  Maybe.  But when it leads to purchases as brilliant as this, I don't really care anymore. <br />The Stone Roses could have been the biggest band in the world, but somewhere along the line, something went terribly wrong.  They only released two albums in their career, and a handful of non-album singles.  This was their debut, and what a debut it was. <br />From the opening chords of &quot;I wanna be adored&quot; to the endless guitar jam at the end of &quot;I am the resurrection&quot;, this is music to lose yourself in.  The fact that this album was released in the 80's (the decade of one-hit wonders) elevates this album to legendary status. <br />Only the Roses can make a pop gem (&quot;Waterfall&quot;) and the same song backwards (&quot;Don't stop&quot;) sound like totally different songs.  It was only recently when I discovered that not only is the music backwards, but the lyrics as well!  Any band that can make a backwards song sound as good as this is well worth investigating. <br />Many say the Roses resurrected guitar pop.  I find it hard to disagree with this sentiment.  Every song on this album is a pop gem.  Take the risk like I did.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.
0380789019|4.0|This is a wonderfully imaginative read.  Never again will you think of London in quite the same way.  You'll never look at a dark stairway or tube entrance quite the same way again.  In Gaiman's book, what goes on under the London I know is more colorful that what happens at street level.    Richard Mayhew is the &quot;Hitchcock like&quot; figure--an ordinary man caught up in and extraordinary situation. We watch as Mayhew travels to London by train.  His routine laden life seems to be on schedule and then he meets an injured girl on the street.  He goes underground and into the world of incredible characters and scenes.  Door, Hunter, the omnipresent and wicked Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar.  Earl's Court (not like the one on the Tube map) and the magnificent Angel Islington.  The swashbuckling marquis de Carabas.  The &quot;Beast&quot; that lives in the London sewer system.  This is extraordinary stuff.  You will see parts of London from Roman and Celtic times that have long since been buried, but that are part of the underground world.  Its a fun and dark story and one that I thoroughly enjoyed.
B000002TQB|5.0|I'm a huge Oasis fan.  Which makes it hard to be a Blur fan, because the guys can't stand each other.  But there's no denying that &quot;Parklife&quot; is a superb album. <br />If anyone in the future ever asks what this whole British pop scene was about, this is the album to give them.  It is the quintessential Britpop album.  Starting with the dance-influenced &quot;Girls and boys&quot;, &quot;Parklife&quot; leads us through 16 pop songs of everyday Brits doing everyday British things.  What makes this album so amazing is the way the band make such everyday things sound like so much fun. <br />Blur manage to turn bank holidays into ninety second blasts of punk.  Debt collectors are no longer mob henchmen who will chop off your thumbs.  Instead they are nice fellas who deserve jazzy instrumentals dedicated to them.  Even bassist Alex James has his say in his off-beat composition &quot;Far out&quot;, with bizarre French lyrics thrown in at no extra cost.  Nothing epitomises the sound on this album better than the sing-along anthem &quot;Parklife&quot;, narrated by actor Phil Daniels.  It is a perfect snapshop of everyday British life, and man does it sound good. <br />I always draw parallels between the end of this album and the end of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.  Both albums are chock full of irresistible pop songs, and both end with a gorgeous epic.  &quot;This is a low&quot; is a perfect example of how Blur can still make some seriously good music when they try hard enough.  In constrast to the pop dominating the rest of the album, it sounds nothing less than a masterpiece.  And just like &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; ends in a nonsensical run-out groove, &quot;Parklife&quot; ends with &quot;Lot 105&quot;, a pointless one and a half minute instrumental, just to remind us not to take them too seriously. <br />Every now and then an album comes along that perfect summarises its genre.  Just as many people consider &quot;Never mind the bollocks&quot;  the essential punk album, I believe this will go down in history as the ultimate Britpop album.
B0000203YT|5.0|I loved it more every time I watched it!
B000000WF0|5.0|I'll admit - this album took a while to grow on me. <br />Many songs on it are simply irresistable, especially &quot;Sonnet&quot;, &quot;The Drugs Don't Work&quot; and &quot;Lucky Man&quot;.  But there were a few songs which didn't really do it for me initially, including the most famous track on the album, &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot;.  I found it terribly overrated.  Several other songs, including &quot;The Rolling People&quot;, &quot;Neon Wilderness&quot; and &quot;Catching the Butterfly&quot;, naturally didn't appeal to me initially because they were more like aural soundscapes rather than tightly written pop songs.<br />Then I decided to give the album a few more listens.  Slowly, like a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle, the pieces to this masterpiece started fitting together nicely.  I started to appreciate some other fine songs on this album, including &quot;Space and Time&quot;, &quot;One Day&quot;, and the masterpieces &quot;Weeping Willow&quot; and &quot;Velvet Morning&quot;.  Even &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; started sounding better, because I knew what other fantastic pieces it led to. <br />I started to appreciate the album for more than just a collection of songs.  Individual moments on this album may not be mind-blowing.  &quot;Neon Wilderness&quot; is predominantly a psychedelic instrumental with a few words repeated throughout.  On it's own, I'd probably never think much of the song.  But when it leads to a masterpiece like &quot;Space and Time&quot;, I see it not as a song, but as a prelude to greater things. <br />It's a pity that The Verve split up after releasing this album.  Like many great bands, their swansong is their masterpiece.  &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; shows the band at their strongest, with all their rock, pop and psychedelic influences at the forefront of this incredible sounding album.
0792101448|5.0|Not only is Once Upon a Time in the West the best western ever made, it is also the best movie ever made, period.  The incredible cinematography, the awesome Ennio Morricone score, and the shockingly brilliant casting of Henry Fonda as one of the most cold-blooded villians ever to light up the big screen combine to produce a true movie masterpiece.  Sergio Leone's meticulous attention to detail produced a film which is, at once, both a visual work of art and an exciting action picture.  Please add my name to the list of people who are anxiously awaitng its release on DVD, and PLEASE use whatever influence you have to encourage its availability with Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS audio.  The soundtrack is the best I have ever heard, and it would be an awful shame to release it in a lesser format.
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead fans tend to fall into two categories.  There's the ones who like &quot;The bends&quot; better.  There's the ones who like &quot;OK computer&quot; better.  There's the ones who like both of them equally.  Then there's the ones who can't count. <br />&quot;Pablo honey&quot; was a solid album of nice pop, but it didn't prepare the world for the dramatic leap of brilliance that was &quot;The bends&quot;.  And while &quot;OK computer&quot; is one of the most innovative albums of the 90's, it's whole is probably a lot better than the sum of its parts. <br />&quot;The bends&quot; differs from &quot;OK computer&quot; in that you can take a song from it, look it as an individual entity, and marvel at its brilliance.  The title track, &quot;High and dry&quot;, &quot;Fake plastic trees&quot;, &quot;Nice dream&quot; - all masterpieces in their own right.  Put it together and you have a fantastic collection of great songs. <br />It may not flow as well as &quot;OK computer&quot; but who cares?  In the end, it's the songs that count, not the concept. <br />Pop/rock music rarely sounds better than this.
0060392886|5.0|This band has done it all and the book captures everything. I knew they did a lot of crazy things, but in the Dirt you will find out you knew nothing really! These guys were crazy and the Ultimate Rock N Roll band as they had all the girls, did all the drugs and have all the scars.
B000001E8P|5.0|Jarvis Cocker is certainly a ... bugger.  This album oozes with ... references galore.  Then he decides to follow this with an album entitled \\"This is hardcore\\".  The man is a walking Viagra. <br />This album has so many hooks you'd think you were at an annual pirate convention.  This is one of the few albums I've bought where I've loved it on the first listen.  It usually takes me at least three listens to start appreciating an album.  Sometimes when I love an album so early on, I get worried that I'm going to get sick of it a lot quicker.  I'll admit there was a time when I was a bit sick of this album.  So I took a break from it.  Then I listened to it again, and wondered why I ever stopped listening to it. <br />Every song on this is a potential hit single.  Of course, this album contains the pop anthems \\"Common people\\" and \\"Disco 2000\\".  But this is only the start.  We have the marvellous opener \\"Mis-shapes\\", which sets the scene for the whole \\"everyday people doing everyday things\\" tone of the album.  Obviously Jarvis' idea of \\"everyday people\\" are the people living in the ... mansion, because practically all the songs on this album have an S classification for sex references. <br />All songs are stories \\"narrated\\" by Jarvis.  \\"I spy\\" talks about a man who makes a living trying to catch people \\"at it\\".  \\"Live bed show\\" talks about all the action that a double bed gets to see over its years.  \\"Underwear\\" talks about well...underwear. <br />And of course \\"Pencil skirt\\" contains the classic line \\"I've kissed your mother twice, now I'm working on your Dad\\". <br />Need I say more?
B00004SWBD|3.0|I first bought slipknot before they where as widely known as they are now. I thought they were pretty cool, in an insane adrenaline only sort of way. <br />The music IS insane. It's very loud and really, really fast. It's great to get pumped up to.  And I have to admit that there is an order to the madness. If you listen carefully, it's almost intelligently composed.<br />But don't get the idea that these guys are Tool or anything.  Technically, they fall BELOW the average line. The vocals rarely go beyond anything but screaching or growling. And there is no track that you can really relate to unless your extremely mad at something.<br />Slipknot's popularity also bother me. They are suppose to be about being different(don't belong, don't exist, don't ever jusdge me), but I don't see this. They have tapped into the mainstream appeal that Limp Bizkit enjoys. They've probably sold more T-Shirts than albums, which I think has to do with the gimmicky masks they wear.<br />In short, you might want to buy it for a workout/pre-game/whatever album. Maybe. But don't buy it expecting a deep musical experience.
B000002BMD|5.0|Like many great albums, &quot;Everything must go&quot; is a masterpiece preceded by tragedy.  The cover shows the three remaining Manics (their heads sitting inside picture frames) looking a little worse for wear.  Of course, they had recently lost fellow band member Richie Edwards, who disappeared following the release of &quot;The holy bible&quot; and to this date, has never been found.  They were left in an impossible situation.  On one hand they had lost one of their best friends.  On the other hand, they didn't know if he was dead or alive, so there was still a sense of hope.  Unfortunately, this mixed emotional state made it hard for them to progress. <br />Instead of moping in Richie's disappearance, they decided to release another album.  But instead of releasing a set of melancholy numbers (like the Whitlams did on &quot;Eternal Nightcap&quot; following Stevie Plunder's death), the Manics released their most upbeat and feel-good songs to date.  Of course, it's difficult for anything released after &quot;The holy bible&quot; (one of the most depressing and angry albums ever released) to not sound upbeat. <br />Half of the tracks on the album contained lyrics written by Richie, including the masterpieces &quot;Elvis Impersonator: Blackpool Pier&quot;, &quot;Kevin Carter&quot; and &quot;Small black flowers that grow in the sky&quot;.  The rest of the tracks are brilliant, tightly written songs in their own right.  There's the anthemic singles &quot;Design for life&quot;, &quot;Everything must go&quot; and &quot;Australia&quot;, the glam-influenced &quot;The girl who wanted to be God&quot;, and the superb closing epic &quot;No surface all feeling&quot;. <br />Many Manics purists thought this album was a sell-out to a more commercial sound.  While the music on &quot;Everything must go&quot; is immediately more accessible than its predecessors, I believe this is the first time Manics let go of their punk past and played like the brilliant musicians they were. <br/>If only Richie were alive to hear it.  Or is he?
B000002N2Z|3.0|If you are a Tool fan who are checking out similiar music, you picked the right band. But the wrong album.<br />This is less like Tool and more like...korn.<br />It's not terrible, Deftones were sort of pioneers in Nu Metal. But they have evolved much since this album. In their latest disc, White Pony, Deftones picked up a smoother, melodic, Tool-influenced sound. That's what your looking for.<br />This is heavy riffs and screaching vocals with a dash of rap-rock. Not bad, but it just can't compare to their more recent effort.
076780421X|3.0|This is not a movie that I would watch multiple times but for one scene: the final wedding ceremony in the desert at the rhythm of &quot;Can't Help Loving You&quot; by Elvis. It is only one minute, but it is incredibly sweet and romantic.<br />Another positive aspect of the movie is Salma Hayek's physical presence. I agree one hundred percent with that movie critic who wrote that she has the face of an angel and a body to kill for. She is at the same time sensual and sweet, a really devastating combination...<br />As for the rest of the movie, it was enjoynable, but not exceptional. Yes, the actors had grat chemistry and were both really good, but it's their characters tht I could not like that much, especially Alex. He is too modernly confused a man for me to like him. He still acts and behaves like a boy. He is galaxies away from the William Wallace of &quot;Braveheart,&quot; or even the cocky Doug Dorsey of &quot;The Cutting Edge.&quot; As for Isabel, she was more mature and also really sweet, but her stress on her catholic heritage turned me off... (come on, signs everywhere?)<br />Anyways, a positive message from the movie is that a marriage is a serious commitment based on love, care and understanding, and not something to be taken lightly a là Las Vegas wedding chapels.<br />But let us not forget that a marriage is also about romance, and that final kiss at the wedding with the song of Elvis in the background really made me smile for a day.
B00004Z400|5.0|Deftones have evolved. The latest from Deftones is a departure fom the Nu Metal Adrenalin and Aroud the Fur and has a strong Tool influence(don't believe me? Check out the guest vocalist on &quot;passenger&quot;).<br />I personally love this. The music is still heavy, just slowed down. Chino really gets to use his full vocal range, and as it turns out he has a great voice that can do more that belt out screeching howls.<br />They ARE still the same band, though. There are a few heavy songs that Deftones purist will probably be able to relate to. Elite, for example, was obviously made specifically for moshing, and lyrics twisted enough to make Slipknot jealous(when your ripe/ you'll bleed out of control).<br />It's just a great album and I can't recommend it highly enough to Korn and ESPECIALLY Tool fans.
B000002H97|5.0|I first heard of Metallica when I was in high school and a friend of mine let me borrow AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. At the time, it was very new to me and I fell in love with Metallica's hard edgy sound, especially ONE, which is still my favorite metallica song. I have since purchased all of Metallica's albums, from KILL EM ALL to S&amp;M. I have to say that out of all the Metallica albums this has to be there best. Every Metallica album is unique if you listen to them hard enough and have a good ear for music. If you are looking for old school heavy metal, I think Master of Puppets is the hardest and fastest Metallica album. The lightest is RELOAD, but in terms of the best all around album, THE BLACK ALBUM, takes it for me. It is Metallica at there transition period when they started to get melodic. I love heavy music, but have an ear for soft melodic music as well. I am not on of those music listeners that has only one type of music and only listens to that and that only. I give everything a try and don't disrespect any type of music. THE BLACK ALBUM is Metallica's most succesful album to date and it's most popular. To me you cannot be a rock fan without listening to this album. You appreciate this album even more when you listen to it straigth through from beginning to the end. They hit you hard with ENTER SANDMAN and keep going until the beginning when they slow things down with UNFORGIVEN which shows how James Hetfield has grown as a singer and a songwriter. They end things up with the dark toned MISERY and the hard nosed THE STRUGGLE WITHIN. This album is a classic. If anybody tells you otherwise, they don't know music.
B00005B36H|5.0|This cd is utterly amazing.  It's organic yet technical at the same time.  It shifts gears seamlessly from soft, flowing bass lines to hard, riveting riffs that are almost mathematical in nature.   Jones and Chancellor work well together--complementing each other's playing.  The bass plays an essential, if not integral part of the music.  It's not just a low foundational noise.   Dan Carey is brilliant again.  His drum work is bafflingly complex, but what about this album isn't?  There are so many twists and turns on this album it's difficult to grasp on the first listen.  I'm a guitarist, and it took me a week to figure out what Jones is doing in some of these songs. Completely unpredictable...which is refreshing considering the bulk of modern rock consists of systematic guitar and bass work that follows a strict pattern.   Maynard is impressive in both lyrical content and delivery.  He can scream like a a maniac and then turn around on the next song and deliver a smooth, resonant vocal.  It's this type of variation that makes this album so appealing.  It takes you around a musical landscape so vast one might get lost.  Just listen to this cd a few times to get your bearings.
B00005B36H|1.0|not only was it incredibly neanderthalish lyrically, but the music took a nosedive as well. carrey's drums, once one of the mightiest, have become a complete and total joke. what a pity. save your money........
6302799066|5.0|Dr.Strangelove is one of the best films ever made! For it's time it was racy and had lots of innuendos and (at the time) social satire.George C. Scott should be recognized for this as one of his best roles next to &quot;Patton&quot; he is absolutely hilarious!!Peter Sellers and of course Slim Pickens are fabulous also. the &quot;dead-pan&quot; &quot;I'm being serious&quot; style of directing and acting make this film even funnier. Leave it to Kubrick to take a serious subject and make it a black comedy classic!!He has made some truely wonderful films! Too bad he ended on a sour note like &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;.But please do yourself a favor and check this one out. And while your at it check out the many other GREAT films hehas made!!I am 39 years old and I LOVE to turn someone younger weaned on 80's T.V. or movies on to this masterpiece!!ENJOY!!

0671722905|5.0|The Folger Series of Shakespeare's works are easy to read, not cluttered with too many notes, but there with help on any words that have fallen out of use overtime. If you like &quot;The Tempest&quot; try &quot;MacBeth&quot; and/or &quot;Lear&quot;, which have a similar feel. MacBeth is by far the easier read, but Lear is well worth the effort despite its length. The Tempest is a must read for lovers of Neil Gaiman's &quot;Sandman&quot; series of graphic novels, along with &quot;Midsummer's Night's Dream&quot;, both of which Gaiman refers to constantly. Shakespeare fans with a love of the bizarre that haven't tried Gaiman might like to check him out. Gaiman's &quot;Brief Lives&quot; is as good a place as any to start... keep in mind though he is addictive as Shakespeare.
B00003CWTH|5.0|Generally, there are two types of movies:  movies that entertain and movies that make you think.  This movie is NOT for the person who wants to be entertained. It is not your average Hollywood film brimming over with sex and violence, thank God. Rather, Magnolia is a deep and thought-provoking movie about people coming to terms with the past and forgiveness.  Tom Cruise is excellent and deserved an Oscar for his performance.  His character is amazing, disgusting and heartbreaking all at once.  This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. I highly recommend Magnolia to those who seek out movies for meaning and not for entertainment.

B00003Q43G|5.0|Take one James Cameron movie, about a technological disaster at sea that forms the backdrop for a gripping love story.  Add another blockbuster, about a motley crew of oil drillers called on to save the world.  Sprinkle in a classic late 1968 movie about an outer space adventure to meet intelligent life on the other side of the universe.  Add some neat science, a little humanity, cutting edge special effects, and a whole lot of water.  Mix briskly.  Serve... &quot;The Abyss&quot;.<br />Comparisons to &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;Armageddon&quot;, and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; notwithstanding, this is a gripping movie.  Some have called it overlong, slow, and boring.  Not to my eyes.  The action sequences are intense and suspenseful, tempered nicely by some highly charged emotional content.<br />Any problems Cameron later ran into on &quot;Titanic&quot;, he managed to solve perfectly here.  That film's clunky script is replaced here by a techno-jargon packed (what were you expecting from Cameron's writing?  Poetry?) story filled with minimalist but rather effective dialogue.  Sure, there are some groaners that pop up once in a while, but they are few and far enough in between to be easily overlooked.  When the sense of drowning and claustrophobia is this tangible, you can let the filmmaker get away with some mistakes.<br />The motley crew is headed by Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who begin fighting like a recently divorced couple should, but slowly grow close again as the pressure of their circumstances closes in.  They have great chemistry together in both aspects, and manage fine performances despite the rigorous on-set conditions (Harris, for on, has such ill memories of the shoot that he refuses to talk about the movie).  The rest of the crew is like something out of a Jerry Bruckheimer film: familiar faces playing eccentric but two-dimensional characters (Todd Graff even looks like Bruckheimer regular Steve Buscemi).  Only here, their humanity and professionalism shines through (although whoever thought of casting Chris Elliott should have realized what a distraction that would be).  Michael Biehn, who plays the leader of the Navy SEALs team assigned to investigate the demise of a nuclear sub, gets to twitch and shake his way into underwater madness.  And he does it quite well.<br />As for the aliens, well, even though their ultimate purpose is unclear in the story, I'm not sure it really matters.  Please accept their ineffableness, and admire their beauty.  The water effects (which Cameron later adapted to create &quot;Terminator 2&quot;) are still breathtaking.  Imagine the impact they must have had on an audience in 1989.  And the ending, which has been attacked and attacked and attacked, is no less believable or authentic than any other sci-fi movie.  It has a wondrous Atlantis-risen-from-the-depths quality to it, that shouldn't be interpreted intellectually.  Rather it is a highly charged and effective visceral moment that should be enjoyed as such.  Just like the rest of the movie.
B00004Z511|5.0|I personally thought OK Computer was the pinnacle of human achievment in the area of music.  And after 3 long years of waiting Kid A comes out.  I raced down to my local record store and on the way home I popped it into my cd player.  My first thoughts were \\"what the f*** has Radiohead done\\"  Everything in it's right place had wierd synths and multiple Thoms chanting very repetitive lines.  Kid A was wierded out with a music box like sound along with some techno esq. drumming over Thom's distorted voice.  The National Anthem was all over the place.  It seemed more like chaos than music.  <br />When I got home I took a deeper listen and things cleared up for me.  I listened all the way through and I found the beauty in EIRP and I enjoyed the free jazz of National Anthem.  The album has a very flowing state.  Optimistic flows beautifully into In Limbo.  Idieoteque flows even better into Morning Bell.  You will never appreciate this album if you don't listen to it from start to finish.  <br />Everything In It's Right Place- 10/10 Beautiful lyrics and sets the mood for the entire album.  Without it this album wouldn't be anything.<br />Kid A- 9/10 Alright lyrics and deep atmosphere.  Musically maybe at the most complex.  And when the synths come in it's just awe inspiring.  I give it a point down because I hate it when Thom uses [crummy] distortion.<br />National Anthem- 10/10 Free Jazz, funky bass line intervined by a collage of horns.  Not many vocals but musically you will get the message of the song.<br />How to Disappear Completly- 10/10 In my opinion the best work on the album.  Very atmospheric and relaxing.  A mantra like chant from Thom along with a unique string section set the mood just right.<br />Treefingers- 10/10 A great ambient piece that flows greatly with the album, trust me if you listen to the album from start to finish this little piece is needed.<br />Optimistic- 10/10 The lone rocker on the album, sounds kinda like it could've been out of the Bends era.  Lyrically it's perfect.  It's about how the music industry is [twisted].  Tribal esq. drumming with all 3 guitars going.  <br />In Limbo- 10/10 A very wierd piece that has a strange music time to it.  <br />Idioteque- 10/10 Dancy industrial esq. piece with perfect lyrics.  Seeming thrown randomly out of no where. <br />Morning Bell- 10/10 A really atmospheric peice about a ghost in Thoms house.  Great drumming.  Great keyboards and a psuedo rapping finish Walking walking walking walking...<br />Motion Picture Soundtrack- 10/10 I love the harps.  Ending line is perfect.  Originally written in their Bends days.
B000007MVX|5.0|If you heard &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, and thought it was great, then most likely when you heard that the follow up was in the same vein, a 45 minute single track/epic you probably had your hopes up. To some it is considered inferior to the previous effort, or JT's worst album, I personally don't agree with anyone of those thoughts. To me this is just as good, if not better than Thick As A Brick. <br />A Passion Play is probably the most bleak, dense, gloomy and  dark musically and thematically out of the Jethro Tull catalog and it may come as something of an acquired taste. As with most prog or anything intricate, It took me at least 7-10 listens before this mammoth work really began to &quot;take me&quot;.<br />The theme is centered around life after death, and probably about deciding whether or not the person wishes he could come back to life, or go to hell, or got to heaven, I'm not totally sure, but that's fine with me because more importantly, it's the music that takes center stage. It features english folk, classical, in-the-heat-of-the-night jazz, and rock, and features many twists and turns within it's 45 minutes. Ian Anderson should be very proud of this achievment as it is very complex lyrically and his ability to write thought-provoking lyrics and to be an extremely great musician and composer, if not somewhat underrated. Not only does he sing, he also plays the acoustic guitar, flute, and 2 different type of saxaphones. Also John Evan, his organ playing was top notch on here. The drumming is great, just the musicianship overall is very impressive. There's also The Story Of The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles, which I don't pay much attention to, but once again the musicianship is top notch. This is supposed to split the 2 halves of the epic as it comes right after the first 20 minute half.<br />Overall, I thought this was a terrific effort by this band and my advice to some is don't give up after one listen. This work may take quite some time to clickas it did with me. <br />I own this, Thick As A Brick and Aqualung. This may come as a bit of a suprise, Aqualung was good, but is my least favorite out of the three, even Ian Anderson has said that he does not think that Aqualung was the best Jethro Tull album. Anyway, to me this is one of those albums that stands the test of time and does not age at all. A Total Masterpiece.<br />Thanks.
B0000024K1|5.0|I enjoy this ground breaking, earth shaking CD from PUBLIC ENEMY.  The release of IT TAKES A NATION OF MILLIONS... did more than legitimize hip-hop and a successful recording career for Chuck D and the band.  It changed the shape of music, opening up an avenue for serious lyrical content in songs with a hard edge.  Chuck D demonstrates his literary prowess by quoting from Gil Scott Heron (&quot;The revolution will not be televised&quot;), Malcom X (&quot;Black, too strong&quot;) and other leading African-American spokesmen.  They know on whose shoulders they stand.  I enjoy the rap in the style of James Brown on SELL OUT, and the sly humour of SHE WATCH CHANNEL ZERO?!.  If you are interested in the roots of hip-hop, or music with brains as well as brawn, this CD will be interesting to you.
B00001IVOR|5.0|After exploding onto the scene with their revolutionary debut, the Wu-Tang Clan returns with their appropriately titled sophomore effort, \\"Wu-Tang Forever\\".  The perpetua of Wu-Tang is evident in each of this group's members, as they have matured nicely in style, artistry, and interpretation.  Moreover, they have delved into the fashion market and have vigorously and successfully pursued their line of Wu-Wear.  This attitude accompanies the themes, purpose, and power of their song.<br />The double album begins with a track entitled \\"Wu-Revolution\\" which guides you into the record with a narrative forecast of upcoming tracks.  It continues with the seamless simplicity of \\"Reunited\\".  Accompanied by a female vocalist and a violin, this song boasts a powerful tone and catchy tune; it is a prime example of Wu-Tang's lyrical, technical, and artistic mastery.<br />Greeting us with an introduction, which leads us into their hit single, the second disc begins with a powerful prelude. At first it may be mistaken as mindless propagandist drivel.  But, at a closer listen one will notice the mention of distinguishing genres of music, specifically R&amp;B/Soul opposed to that of hip-hop; this is a critical distinction.  This idea should be applauded, as the dissimilarity of these genres is frequently abused.  Again the subject of unity or reuniting is stressed in this opening.  Skilfully, this thematic symmetry (as to the first disc) reiterates key points.<br />\\"The Triumph\\", the Clan's most popular song, cycles through a number of solos by each of the Clan's members.  This track provides the listener with a stylistic and philosophical example of each of these individuals' manner and meaning.  It cleverly gels with a unique beat and the occasional broken rasp of a female vocalist.<br />Wu-Tang, being partial to interludes, introduction, and coda, fittingly concludes the album with an \\"Outro\\".  \\"The Closing\\" is a final testament.  A single member of the Clan conveys their troubles and tribulations.  He finishes his message (presumably before escaping onto a helicopter as the album suggests) with the allegory of these words \\"If you're going to spread mathematics, spread it right\\".<br />It seems that the visions of a small band of State Island delinquents has come a long way.  Harnessing the power of their kung fu metaphors, Wu-Tang atones to the erratic hip-hop wit of their previous recordings.  Again they have conquered hip-hop and have proved to their fans that they are truly eternal.<br />Much Love and Peace to the Gods!
B000002H70|5.0|I will try hard to not make this a pile of slavering praise, a difficult task given that The Cure are without question my favorite band. Anyhoo, this may well be one of the most creative and beautiful works of music of all time. The Cure use an enormous variety of instruments, and even when they use conventional ones they still don't sound conventional at all. (Example: the amazing guitar in between verses in &quot;Lovesong&quot;.) Almost all of the songs on Disintegration have some memorable aspect to them (the bass line in &quot;Prayers for Rain&quot;, the chimes in &quot;Plainsong&quot;, the brass section in &quot;Untitled&quot;, or Smith's bizarre whispering in &quot;Lullaby&quot;). Of course, the most unforgettable instrument may be Smith's mournful howl, a beast the likes of which I've never seen anywhere else. The lyrics tell tales of longing, hopelessness, and betrayal, common fare in rock'n'roll but made real by Smith's passion (and when he quiets down, the music only serves to amplify the feeling).<br />Another thing about The Cure that is extremely appealing is that, despite the lush arrangements and the complexity of the instruments, they never seem self-consciously arty or overblown. And when you're talking about a 72-minute epic by a band with a reputation for being goth (we all know that goths are some of the most pretentious people ever) where only one track clocks in at under 4 minutes (&quot;Lovesong&quot;, which was quite a radio hit at the time), that's quite an achievement. Nothing here seems forced, no song seems like it's out of place, and the two bonus tracks (CD version) fit in perfectly with the others. It really is beautiful. Thank you.
B00001OH1S|3.0|If you like Jazz music or movie soundtracks , you might like this CD. I like this movie and I love the CD!! Buy it!!
B000050FEN|4.0|Yeah, this is amazing. The first time you'll see this movie you'll just stare. When I first saw it I watched the credits, not to see who was who, but just because. The ending is so amazing that I did that. The rest of the movie is pretty great. This movie is odd though because the entire film is just building up to the ending and if you just saw the last scene the end would mean nothing. <br />The storys about and new cop to the NYPD(Brad Pitt) and a retiring cop(Morgan Freeman) As the story goes along they discover that a killer is going to kill 7 people based on the Seven deadly sins. It's a great plot. The acting seems out of place. Detective Somerset seems to be a guy of great wisdom, while Brad Pitt just seems to ...though the movie.<br />The Extras are pretty bland. They could have been onto one disc. The endings are pretty bland and the exact same. The rest is just boring. The movie is alone is worth the DVD and the extras are just kinda, there.<br />So, if you haven't already seen the movie than a DVD is a way to start, but if you already own the VHS version than ya might wanna buy another one of David Fincher's movies.
B000051VWW|5.0|What's left to say.  Just another great album to play during a romantic dinner!
B00004YRQA|5.0|Well, it works perfect. No problems at all. And the price will not drop. This is your best buy over anything else. Yeah it's expensive, but it's 8mb so your not going to need a new card to keep your data for awhile.
B00003CXQY|5.0|This was the best movie I've ever seen!
0767817648|4.0|\\"Blue Thunder\\" is about as perfect as a B-grade thriller can get. It has all the right clichés: the tortured Vietnam vet, the inexperienced sidekick, the grumpy boss, the slimy and smart villain. And, of course, there's the \\"MacGuffin\\", an old Alfred Hitchcock term for a particular object in a movie that everyone pursues. In this case, the MacGuffin is a prototype helicopter, presumably being loaned to the LAPD to head off potential terrorist [movements] during the Olympic Games (this movie was made in 1983, a year before the games in Los Angeles. At one point in the film, a police dispatcher describes a robbery suspect as a \\"male negro\\". Gives you sort of an idea of how long ago 1983 really was). <br />Murphy (Roy Scheider) is an LAPD helicopter pilot suffering from a pesky case of post-traumatic-stress disorder. His delicate psychological condition has Murphy one step away from forced retirement, and nobody really wants to fly with him. Luckily, his new partner, Lymangood (Daniel Stern), is too young and naive to know about Murphy's problems. He clearly experienced some pretty horrible things over in the Nam, and one night, while attempting to rescue a city councilwoman from two thugs, he has a flashback to when he witnessed the murder of an enemy soldier. <br />Later, after the councilwoman dies from her injuries, Murphy suspects that her murder wasn't the result of a crude rape attempt, as the brass are trying to imply. It may have something to do with the new police helicopter they're trying out. Blue Thunder is essentially a tank with propellers. It's heavily armored and has a wicked-looking machine gun mounted on the nose. It also has surveillance equipment that can \\"see\\" people through walls via their body heat and hear any words that are spoken above a bedroom murmur. The technology, particularly the computer gear, seem archaic nowadays, of course, but it looked pretty impressive back in the days of New Wave and the Evil Empire. <br />Murphy has his misgivings about the chopper, particularly when, during a demonstration, it mows down not only a bunch of cardboard dummies representing terrorists but a few of the ones that represent innocent bystanders. <br />\\"One [dead] civilian for every ten terrorists is an acceptable ratio,\\" one of the shady government men manages to tell Murphy with a straight face. <br />\\"Not if you're the civilian,\\" Murphy responds. <br />Another federal rep involved in the project is a pilot from Murphy's Vietnam days, a snobby British fellow named F.E. Cochran (Malcom McDowell). Try to figure out what those initials stand for. There is no love lost between these two. <br />While taking the chopper on a test ride, Murphy and Lymangood inadvertently record Cochran and his associates discussing their real motives behind the Blue Thunder project, which may include killing Murphy. What follows is a mad dash for the incriminating tape; Murphy hijacks the copter and enlists the aid of his girlfriend, Kate (who is possibly the most reckless driver in movie history) to get the info to the public. Director John Badham deftly handles a great climax in which Cochran and Murphy chase each other in the L.A. skies. My personal favorite moment is a comical sequence involving heat-seeking missiles and a barbecue chicken shack. Nearly the entire film is shot with a hand-held camera, giving it a rough, documentarian feel that I liked a lot. <br />The cast is pretty much top drawer, but the late great Warren Oates steals the whole picture as Murphy's commander, Captain Braddock. Oates continually spews venom and offers paternal advice to Murphy, occasionally doing both at the same time. He also gets all the best one-liners. My favorite: <br />Shady government guy: \\"Did you know Murphy checks his sanity with a wristwatch?\\" <br />Braddock: \\"What do you check yours with, a dipstick?\\" <br />Badham has a few good movies under his belt (\\"Saturday Night Fever\\", \\"Stakeout\\") and quite a few bad ones (\\"Point of No Return\\",\\"Short Circuit\\"). \\"Blue Thunder\\" is basic good Badham: it's no classic, but it gets the job done.
B00005AXEL|5.0|It is so great to have Stevie back!!  I have loved her music for many years now.  Although my favorite &quot;version&quot; of Stevie is from the 70's (oooh...that VOICE!), I will take any music of hers I can get.  This album took me a few listens for the songs to grow on me...now I find myself singing the songs to myself a few times a day now.  Her collaboration with other artists works very well for her.  She definitely has met her match with Sheryl Crow as a producer...John Shanks has done wonderful things for Stevie on this record, too.  The real beauty of this record is that Stevie took some of her great old songs from her song vault (previously only available to fans as scratchy demos, but nevertheless, still wonderful) updated them a tad (although not TOO much of an update, which I like) and then took some of her more recent writings and combined them on one beautiful record.  THANK YOU, STEVIE!!
B0000009TJ|4.0|a great momento from this formidable lineup, of course you must also buy jazz noise here and broadway the hard way too. This one has reworkings of frankie classics like lonesome cowboy burt which is exceptionally funny, zappa changes burt into swaggart and the results are hilarious. The versions of the one size fits all tunes are great and there is some hot guitar even if this tour wasn't his best guitar playing. Heavy duty judy is really 'heavy' guitar with a rousing horn section. We have albert wing kurt mcgettrick paul carmen on the horn section, bobby martin too does some blowing. Mike keneally does great 'ring of fire'. It's not as good as 'make a jazz noise here' though
B000059HAI|4.0|This films is truly a masterpiece of storytelling and historical accuracy.  Unlike the new Bruckheimer/Bay &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; &quot;Tora!&quot; depicts quite accurately, in a compelling manner, the facts and events that lead to the attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet.  Though it lacks a singular character to fixate upon (a John Wayne of sorts, if you will), I believe that it is a strength of this film, as such glorification and exultation of single men in films like &quot;The Longest Day&quot; or &quot;The Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; distract from the history.<br />The film strives quite successfully to drop the viewer right into early December of 1941, with few noticible cues of it being a 1970 production.<br />Just to set the record straight, however, none of the Japanese aircraft in the film are authentic, most being assembled from parts of various U.S. trainer aircraft, mainly AT-6/SNJ Texans.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I was recommended to this CD by a friend who has since bought it. I didn't think no more on it til I saw her latest video, titled the same on TV, and I was impressed. I am so glad that there is someone who don't want to hit the same mold that is supposed to be. This lady gets my vote. Her other songs are good and I highly recommend it. Peace.
B00000I07Q|5.0|Simply put, this cd is excellent.  The first three tracks, &quot;Lay your hands on me,&quot; &quot;Bad Medicine,&quot; and &quot;Born to be my Baby&quot; are all incredible and show Bon Jovi at its best.  Other great tracks include &quot;Wild is the Wind&quot; and &quot;Blood on Blood&quot;.  Of course, there really isn't a bad track on here.  I'm not too big on &quot;Living in Sin&quot;, because Jon does sound kinda like Springsteen, and Springsteen's music pretty much went to hell in a handbasket starting in the 90's(In my humble opinion).  All in all, though, this is a killer cd.  No Bon Jovi fan should even consider passing it up, and if you're new to Bon Jovi, this would be as good a start as any.
B000002HPV|4.0|Bjork has without a doubt, one of the most incredible voices to emerge in the last 20 years. Her spirit of experimentation has not been seen since Kate Bush was in her heyday. Her grasp of many different styles is amazing. On this release, she is more focused on a techo sound ocasionally fused with natural strings and it is on those particular tracks where she shines the most. &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Joga&quot; and &quot;Bachlorette&quot; are by far the strongest here. As with most visionaries, she becomes excessive at times. Being different just for the sake of it doesn't always make something great. There are a couple of tracks on this disc (&quot;Pluto&quot; in particular) that are annoying at best. I can understand her trying to show contrast with the warmth of pieces with the strings with the cold anger expressed on some of the others, but one has to be able to sit through that cold anger without wanting to hurl something through his speakers. That aside, the first 4 tracks and the beautiful &quot;All Is full Of Love&quot; are true sonic gems. Bjork is a talent that has only just scratched the surface of her greatness. Stay tuned for further developments
0553573403|2.0|Boring, tedious, uninteresting.  The only reason I finished is because I'd gotten so far in hoping for something to happen.  Other reviewers compared it to Jordan and Goodkind, maybe if they wrote a history text!  I didn't care about the good guys or the bad guys, so as they died it just didn't matter.  Magic?  It hints at it but never comes through.  You want realism rent Braveheart; this is 700 pages of complete droll!
B00005B364|4.0|This is the 2nd release by the Dutch prog quartet and it really grabbed ears in America in late 72 with &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;. A clever fusion of blistering heavy metal guitar, incredibly fast drum breaks and yes, yodeling. In hindsight, not really the best tune they ever concocted, but certainly different than anything around at that time. It was the first rock instrumental to reach number one in a very long time. The rest of the disc is a mixed bag. After &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; comes &quot;Le Clockhard&quot;. A delicate acoustic guitar piece by Jan Akkermann which is very nice and in shocking contrast to the opening number. Next comes &quot;Janus&quot;. A flute based number that sounds too much like King Crimson's &quot;I Talk To The Wind&quot;. This is followed by the weakest track for which the album is named. It's the only vocal where Thjis Van Leer is actually singing lyrics and those lyrics would make both The Moody Blues and Yes' Jon Anderson blush with embarassment. No real need to linger on that point since this is a band who was 99% instrumental anyway. The next track is called Focus II, and is really representative of their sound. A sort of jazz meets clasical meets rock sound with Jan Akkerman's signature guitar wailings. The rest of the disc is one long track spliced together called &quot;Eruption&quot;. At times it sounds far and away too much like Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, but there are a couple of really fine passages from Akkermann. In closing, I would have to say 3.5 stars. Much greater things were to come with &quot;Focus III&quot; in 73 and with &quot;Hamburger Concerto&quot; in 74. They disbanded sometime in 75 or 76 and re-grouped without Jan Akkerman (It took 2 guitarists to fill those big shoes) in 78 but things were just not the same and they disbanded shortly after never to be heard from again. Jan Akkerman was to go on making quite a name for himself in the world of European jazz.
B000003RCY|5.0|The cd is good when you listen to it loud as hell because the recording of it seems to be low.  It's like 40 to 50 mins.  The works on this album seem to differ from the later albums because they didn't have as much freedom to do what they want but the world is in for the taken with one song at a time (Not relating to any teachings of Adolf Hilter in anyway).  And they are not nazis, just because they are from Germany doesn't mean they are all nazis.  Back to the music, The title track is good at it's own pace while some songs are more faster and intense like the single &quot;You Smell So Good&quot;.  It's even better when you see them live.
B00005KA97|5.0|Saw this flick at the cine here in Colombia.  Funny, poignant, pokes fun at american and brazilian culture... plus it stars Penelope Cruz!
0380730367|4.0|I heard a lot of accolades regarding Dennis LeHane. I read 'Gone Baby Gone' and really didn't like either the story or the characters. <br />I thought I would try again (reading Lehane) as the storyline of 'Prayers for Rain' sounded good and with so many people liking LeHane thought it was worth another shot. <br />I thought 'Prayers' was excellent. Good villain, good characters, action, mystery, comedy and more. It kept me reading until the end. <br />I also like the way they rescued Angie's character from 'Gone Baby Gone' where I found her extremely shallow.
B000050AMB|5.0|I've never been a fanatic of King Crimson. Any era. But Red has always been my favourite. Not just the music, but the players did played a remarkable playing. Now, once again, this album is released in a special format and 24-bit remastered. The package is very beautiful. Cardboard sleeve like most Japanese LP-mini sleeve releases. Lyrics, which was not included in the regular edition. Rare photos, well I'm not very impressed since lots of documentaries can be found anywhere in the 'net. Newspaper clips, now this is what I'm looking for. You can read news and interviews about Red, King Crimson and rumours around their breakup from that year.<br />About the 24-bit itself, I don't know exactly how to impress since my player is still a 18-bit. Got to get a 24-bit player in the future. Meanwhile, you can sweep these newly remastered King Crimson albums while they still exist.
B000002MQ9|5.0|THE TITLE! That's my review and I'm sticking to it!<br />Just buy this! Trust me and Mostly David Baker! (His review is perfect.

630469878X|5.0|Let's go on the road! I'm packing now! LOL! (But hey, maybe someday!) ;):b :smokin !<br />We are definitely both on a Journey aren't we Sis? LOVE IT!<br />Ok, now a review! This movie is fantastic. Five stars without a second thought. Why? It makes the viewer think about CONSEQUENCES! My daughter will definitely watch this, when I feel she is mature enough!<br />ALL WOMEN should see THELMA AND LOUISE! We MUST look ahead and see what the end result of our actions Could be BEFORE we ACT! (Problem is, no one knows how they affect other people...we can't read minds! I wish men knew this!) However, IF we can accomplish this, (thinking about the possible end results of our actions) then Susan, Geena, Brad and Ridley didn't fail in their efforts. This movie has an amazing lesson! Watch it and learn...I am going to watch it again...RIGHT NOW!<br />I hate the alternative ending! I wanted them to LIVE! I want a Thelma and Louise II! Maybe I should write the script this time! Hey Ridley! Gimme a call ok? :)<br />Kellye Joy
B000002UR7|5.0|As it was said before and as it will be said again, people simply regard this as Radiohead's worst CD out of their current collection of albums. For many it is just the beginning in a vast legacy of majestic, disturbing and often-epic music that spawned an entire legion of much more sophisticated musical consumers. Although I will even tell you that this is their worst CD, do not take the words for their face value. Rather, it is still much better then most of the junk on the market today.<br />First and foremost to know about this CD, the epic \\"sonic\\" sound that is provided in other Radiohead works is non-existent in this album, creating a much more personal and alternative style of rock. The grandiose feeling that is present in so many of their later works is nearly a complete rarity in this CD. But perhaps, that is for the better.<br />It has a sense of sad, sadistically personality to it that seems as if a journey has begun and that a peek into a New World has been had, for the band itself and for the listener. But make no mistake; it still stands up as a worthy venture, even compared to their later masterpieces. Should that prompt you to buy it? You could think of it as a novelty if you own all of their other albums, as a trip back to the time before they had their current prominence, during a time in which they where still evolving. This CD, while a good rock CD, proves more then anything that bands musical tastes and artistic value changes, emerges, and blends to create a constantly ascending pallet upon which creative talent can be drawn. If anything, much of the guitar playing is elaborate, over the top, and almost inspired by the American metal era.<br />And then of course, there is the song known as \\"Creep\\", the song that nearly ruined Radiohead as we know it. Few Radiohead fans out there will even look you in the eye, let alone give you respected credit should you mention this song. It was the song that nearly made Radiohead just another one hit wonder,another mmm bop. But thankfully, they did not allow that to happen, they cut back on playing the song, and of course always let their musical inspiration take them to where they saw fit. Never the less, it is perhaps the most majestic, most involving, tragic, satirical song on the entire album. It has a sense of self-pity, wonderment at a beauty that cannot be had, yet self-realization for what you are and what you will always be. It became such a popular song because it was just the start of Radiohead's long career of captivating, grand, innovative music. Like it was said, other Radiohead works have long since outshined this monster of a song, but it still stands as the key to which they unlocked their future reputation. For me, I can see the influence, the reason why Radiohead became what they are within this song. It is just a creative flash in the other songs running amok in this album, a pulse that seemed to trigger later songs like \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", \\"Paranoid Android\\" and the now classic \\"Pyramid Song\\".<br />If you're to buy any CD currently from Radiohead, your best bet is to start with this CD. For those of you who have never experienced their other CDs, then this is the place to start. And for the long time fans who turn away from this CD for knowledge of its infamous history simply listen to it and have knowledge that all of the obstacles presented here where shattered by Radiohead. All of the barriers in this CD, the hard rock sound, the start of a creative impulse, and the unstoppable \\"Creep\\" where set-aside for what we have today. If anything, it's a nice CD to keep yourself busy with until the release of Amnesiac.

0440234743|4.0|The style of The Testament is very fast-paced, adventurous, humurous, and simplistic...I believe that Mr. Grisham writes with movie scripts on his mind.  Is that a bad thing?  It could be, but in this case, NO!  The Testament will make a great movie some day (if produced/directed/acted by the right people)...<br />There is such a great mix of adventure, legal maneuverings, and some subtle romance, just enough to keep the ladies interested but not make the guys gag!  <br />The themes explored offer something for everyone, and make for some interesting situations.  Money vs. Spiritual Happiness is explored, as we go back and forth between several would-be heirs and their greedy desires for a huge inheritance; and the woman who actually won the inheritance, but wants nothing to do with it, for fear of it ruining her own Spiritualness.  She is one of the most at-peace people in the world, working with a Peace Corps-style organization in South America's jungles.  <br />The main character, Nate O'Riley, slowly but surely transforms his attitudes in life as he meets and respects this heiress, Rachel.  <br />I'll agree with some of the people who thought the ending was somewhat abrupt and not fully developed.  But, I'll say no more about that so as not to give it away!  <br />I think most Grisham fans will enjoy this and it'd be a good first Grisham book for people who want to explore this author...

0385501560|5.0|Palahniuk's brilliance is the poetry that leaps out of his blatant vulgarity.  He pounds out such amazing analogies and ridiculous realisms, it is easy to get lost in his satirical world.  Choke is a perfect companion to Fight Club and Survivor.  Palahniuk nails the creepy recesses of the male psyche like no other author.  I devour these books and eagerly await the next.
B000006045|5.0|The feeling I get listening to this album is that it is so dark, that it feels so comfortably personal. The album is really refreshing, and with a wonderful techno, and rock mix, that has a dark and sublime mood to it. All those who have watched the video for the track &quot;Teardrop&quot; know what kind of great taste we are talking about here. The video where the embryo sings in its mother's womb, it was fantastic. I guess only thing that remains to be said, is that you should grab a copy of this album, it is really great. I think it would be a good addition to one's collection.<br />P.S. Remember the scene in the movie &quot;The Matrix&quot; where Neo was sleeping by his computers, just before his computer goes blank, and he was listening to some music at that time. The track he was listening to was the track &quot;Dissolved Girl&quot; from this album.
B0000042H4|5.0|I have three complete RINGs on CD, this one and two live recordings from Bayreuth (Bohm '67 and Clemens Kraus '53).

Since I have only heard bits of what appears to be this set's main competition (Karajan), I can't make a reliable comparison.  Also, insofar as this review compares sets, it does just that.  I take no position here as to whether one might mix and match.  That said, if I had to choose a Desert Island RING, I'd choose this one for a number of reasons.  (If anyone wants to donate their Karajan set, my email is on my profile page...)<br />The foremost reason is the quality of the singing.  For my money, there is not a cast that is more consistently thrilling. I'm not saying that different choices could have been made in some of the series (e.g., for all its sentimental and historical value, Fricka was not Flagstad's greatest role, nor was Flagstad the perfect Fricka).  It's just that, on the whole, the principles, are the best ensemble on record, and, especially in Gotterdammerung, sang better here than on practically anything else they ever recorded.<br />Nilsson is... well, not only is she one of the two or three greatest dramatic sopranos on record, she is so clearly focused here, so thoroughly transcendent.  Hers was a voice that was entirely convincing as a god-become-mortal.  Windgassen is the finest Siegfried on stereo - and his silky, lyrical, yet completely heroic tenor is better than any other recorded Siegfried, and maybe better than anything else even *he* ever recorded.  Although it would seem to go without saying, mysteriously, it does not: It can't be stressed enough how important it is to have a good Siegfried. This is where every other set fails most remarkably (S. Jerusalem on Levine, for example almost dies trying to get through his last scene in Gotterdammerung; even where Windgassen reprises his role for Bohm, he's much more pleasing here).<br />As Wotan, Hans Hotter's performance here has been somewhat controversial because people generally say he was too old. (Hotter sings on Walkure and Siegfriend; George London is Wotan on Rhinegold.) On the contrary, his Wotan is the most heartbreaking on record for me precisely because it comes at the end of a long career of studying and singing this role, finding its depths, and reaching for dramatic resonance that no one else equals, IMHO.  Sure Morris is great, but  while his Wotan is bigger more furious, Hotter's is wiser and more deeply resigned.  Anyway, are you going to buy a whole set for Morris? Neidlinger's Alberich is terrifying.<br />Gustav Neidlinger's Alberich is a combination of absolute musicality with unsurpassed dramatic rigor.  He is existentially terrifying in every scene that he's in.<br />James King and Regine Crespin are fine as the twins.  This Walkure is generally regarded as the weakest leg on this set.  I think that's only because the human mind, and particularly the mind of the typical \\"operatchik,\\" works that way - it is essential to find fault.  Nothing is perfect but that unrecorded ideal performance in the misty past...  I don't have a clue what is objectionable here.  The only thing I can think of is that, of all the parts of this RING, it is possible to imagine a cast that's equally as good as that of Walkure here.<br />The second string is equally inimitable: Gottlob Frick's amazing Hagen and almost as amazing Hunding , Fischer-Dieskau's Gunther, Claire Watson's Gutrune, and Christa Ludwig's fine Waltraute. Of equal interests are such \\"incidentals\\" such as Joan Sutherland's Woodbird, the Rhinemaiden trio in Gotterdammerung of Lucia Popp, Gwyneth Jones and Maureen Guy (who?), the amazing Gerhard Stolze as Mime on Siegfried, and of course, Flagstad's Fricka only add miracles upon miracles.  Does anyone think that we'll ever see a comparable cast?<br />As for Solti and the VPO, well, first, I don't think Vienna has ever been touched for its pure sensuality.  I love the moods.  I love the thunder.  I love the horns and the voluptuous strings. As for Solti, I'm a fan:  I love his drama and his melodrama.  I totally disagree with his detractors who complain of his alleged bombast.  Shouldn't an authentic Wagnerian show a little bombast?  And shouldn't a RING orchestra stand as something far more than a huge \\"guitar\\" in any performance?  Not only that, but to read some reviewers, you would think that \\"bombast\\" was this recording's main characteristic.  Frankly, I just don't understand that view.  I think the orchestral performance here, whether attributable mainly to Solti, producer Culshaw, the VPO or all three, has not been surpassed in subtlety and insight on anything I've ever heard.<br />Finally, there's the Culshaw factor.  Those who know what he was doing here will have their opinions.  I think it was a monumental project that took as its touchstone an truth about this drama that is too often ignored:  This music was written for the stage.  Any audio recording then, will be ultimately lacking.  What Culshaw did, more successfully than any other producer, was give us an audio RING that, by explointing stereo/hi-fi technology, approximates a theatrical experience.<br />I could go on.  But ultimately, it is my opinion that at least here, you can believe the hype.>As for Solti and the VPO, well, first, I don't think Vienna has ever been touched for its pure sensuality.

0345404475|4.0|Philip K. Dick's name isn't a household one, but the movies &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Total Recall&quot; are quite popular distillations, and to a degree corruptions, of his coolest notions: that what we think of as being reality isn't real, and what makes us human is our capacity to care about others, not our ability to think or our use of technology.  &quot;Androids&quot; is the book that was ultimately filmed as &quot;Blade Runner&quot; after being rewritten by more scriptwriters than this book has main characters. The setting here is not a decadent futuristic super-city but a post-apocalyptic world, after nuclear wars have destroyed almost all non-human life on this planet. Androids here are straightforward villains, lacking the sublime human touches their on-screen portrayers brought to them; the ending is, in fact, quite different here, much less powerful than what was seen in the film---even Dick himself thought, and said, as much. Deckard, the book's hero, is a grumpy married man who just wants to do his job well and try to love his painfully unappealing wife, and he largely fails at both endeavors---even his affair with Rachael the android is pretty sad stuff, and when he finally gets a real animal as a pet (the ultimate status symbol), well...let's just say, you'll feel the end of this book like a brick tossed at your forehead. This isn't his best work, but it might well be the perfect vehicle for anybody who wants to get introduced to his morbid humor, incredible flights of fancy, and his penetrating, cosmic themes of life, love, artifice, decay, and confusion---in many ways, he was the first &quot;cyberpunk&quot; author, doing his best work at least twenty years before the term was even coined. If you don't constantly compare this book to the Ridley Scott/Harrison Ford movie drawn from it, you will have a very good time; it's quite spooky, cool stuff, not perfect but about as good as it gets. Dick was perhaps the most brilliant, twisted, visionary sf writer ever---see for yourself here.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a must for everyone.  The book's narrator, Jean Louise &quot;Scout&quot; Finch, is a tomboy from Maycomb, a &quot;tired old town&quot; deep in Southern tradition during the '30s. Although most of the novel depicts Scout's childhood, the last half of the novel connects with the beginning to tell a story that leaves everyone moved.  Tom Robinson, a young, friendly black man, has been charged with the rape of a girl by a trashy and disrespected family, and Scout's father, Atticus, has been asked to defend Tom.  The family's struggle through this trial and the life lessons learned by Scout make this book top-notch.  If you haven't read it, buy it today- you can finish it in a weekend, but it will impact you for a lifetime.
B00000IFP6|3.0|I am really partial to the Karl Bohm Beethoven cycle with the Vienna Philharmonic.  One of the reasons is the style of the playing.  Lyrical, refined, sophisticated, and fun.  These recordings have almost none of that.  It is the strangest thing.  Beyond &quot;cold&quot;, there is an absense of musicality that I still haven't quite come to grips with.  It's like an audio  photograph of the score, rather than a painting. There are plenty of good things to say about them: Nice recording, instruments mostly have excellent tone, and the price can't be beat. But I can't get over the fact that virtually no atmosphere is created.  When a rest occurs, it's like the universe just stopped and then blackness..until the little white notes start popping out again.
0380002930|5.0|&quot;Oh great, a book about rabbts,&quot; is the first thing I thought when my 9th grade English teacher handed this book out last year.  Even after reading the first couple chapters, I wasn't convinced the novel would interest me- but it turned out to be one of my favorites.  As a group of rabbits travels through a forest to seek a new warren, at the deranged advice of one of the younger rabbits, Fiver, Richard Adams explores some of the world's political systems at the time in the different warrens.  Some of the lovable characters they meet along the way, such as Kehaar, a Black-headed Gull, keep humor in the sometimes dark novel.  You'll most likely have to read this book in school, but if you never had to, I really recommend you buy it.  It sure ain't just a bunch of rabbits to this Texan!
B000002TPS|5.0|A few may complain about the more melodic sound to a lot of this album's songs, but to me, that's part of what makes this album so damn good! Each song is carefully composed and fitting for their respected subjects, so you can easilly play them in your mind whenever you'd like. The guitars were also tuned down half a key, meaning most of the songs are in E-Flat rather than E, A-Flat rather than A, etc. giving the album a more moody/atmospheric sound to it. Much like the previous Countdown to Extinction, some of the songs on this album help to put the word &quot;cool&quot; (as in neat) in Megadeth's music, such as the riff in Train Of Consequences (Which really makes you feel like you're on a train barreling through the wastelands), the beat in Elysian Fields, and pretty much everything in the song Victory, which creatively strings previous song and album titles from the band together to tell a strange yet interesting story. Not to mention Mustaine's singing voice sounds a lot better here than on any other Megadeth album (pre and post Youthanasia) and the lyrical themes/compositions are also among Megadeth's finest. In brief, if you're a Megadeth fan or just an all around fan of great music, pick this album up along with Countdown To Extinction, Peace Sells, and Rust in Peace immediately. You won't be disappointed!
B00005BL2A|5.0|I must admit I did not expect much from this album because some of SOFAD and most of Ultra had led me to believe that DM was going down in flames. I am ecstatic that these guys proved me wrong re-taking their rightful place at the forefront of the musical scene. Give the CD a couple of spins before passing judgement, and I promise you won't regret it.
6305041156|5.0|When I first watched this movie I had some mixed feeling because of how violent and depressing this movie was. After a second viewing which almost didn't happen, I then knew this movie was a masterpiece. The acting was superb and more realistic than anything I can even imagine and the battles were done rather well. A few other things that bothered me was the blood which seemed very unrealistic at times and seemed kind of orangy at times. One other thing I didn't understand was towards the end of the movie the soliders were [taking bullets and got knocked] off their horses and they seemed to be getting back up and none of the horses seemed to [have taken any bullets]. Other than these minor problems this movie is great and if you in with an open mind you should be okay and you might be depressed for awhile after the movie. Great movie and it is on my top 10 list of all time movies.
B00000G5VI|5.0|The Buddha Of Suburbia is a first timer in the U.S. and was issued in '93 as an import only. This CD is the music to the British series of the same name and contains an earlier version of &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot; (updated on Outside). The tune &quot;Sex And The Church&quot; and &quot;The Mystery&quot; again are classic Bowie. The music defintely hints at the direction Bowie was to leap into on his '95 Virgin debut Outside. No Bowie fan should be without this CD
B00000K19E|4.0|I didn't have too many problems with this movie, but I know it could have been better. Joe was great and you better watch him on the Sopranos because he's great there to. Lets hope the sequel doesn't fall flat.

Using a street language that is easy to decipher, Burgess tells a tale of the not to distant future or is it the present?<br />Alex the leader is captured by the police and is sent to prison where he is offered a controversial treatment. The tratment is a sort of brainwashing that makes Alex ill everytime he encounters violence.<br />Alex is let out of prison and finds it very difficult to find his way in the world. He is cast out by his parents and brutalized by one of his droogs who has become a policeman.  <br />Finally the brainwashing wears off and Alex turns back into a street thug and he finally tires of his brutal life.
B000000H5K|1.0|Sepultura have to be kidding with this record.  All the elements of thrash metal have been removed to make way for repulsive tribal influenced rythems.  The album starts of with the Nu-Metal garbage tune \\"Roots, Bloody, Roots,\\" and just gets worse as it goes on during it's 60 + running time.  \\"Lookaway,\\" the song that features Jonathan Davis of Korn, Mike Patton of Faith No More, and D.J. Lethal is atrocious.  The lyrics are distored and unclear and the guitar riffs and drumming are slower than the pace of a snail crawling on dry pavement.  The only fast song here is dictatorS#$t and it's more in hardcore vein than thrash metal days of their previous albums Arise and Beneath The Remains.  After the lackluster Chaos A.D. I feared Sepultura were on their way to a downfall they would never recover from.  After listening to Sepultura's later albums Against and Nation I was clearly right. It was probably right that they kicked Max out.  At least their new albums try to incorporate a few thrash tunes into the mix. Soulfly's albums Soulfly and Primitive are possibly the 2 WOSRST metal albums to come out in the past 3 years.  Avoid them at all costs!! It's a dark time for Thrash Metal kids!!!
0671042858|4.0|I really enjoyed this one by Stephen King.  It was one of his more logically writtn books about survival and love.  A young girl with the strength and courage some of us could only wish for.  I enjoyed this one immensely.
B0000028PL|5.0|Stain is a dark album, heavy with a sensibility that is not quite heavy metal.  Vernon Reid's guitar is more a collage of processed sound than riffs and fluidly played scales.
B00005ATQI|3.0|The one plus I have to give this movie is that it was extremely scary.  It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  However, many negatives make even a 3-star rating generous.  First of all, after reading the novel, I was very disappointed in the movie.  The whole focus was totally different in the novel than in the movie.  In the novel, the focus is on Danny Torrance's ability to &quot;shine&quot; (see the future and bad things that are gonna happen and communicate with others without talking) and how the Overlook Hotel is extremely evil.  But in the movie, the focus is totally on Jack Torrance going insane.  However, this happens so quickly, that you don't even understand what the heck Danny is doing when he keeps talking to &quot;Tony&quot; (Danny is 'shining').  Over all, the movie is scary, but that's it.  Read the novel by Stephen King instead.
B00005B36H|4.0|These guys are going on tour with King Crimson.  Listening to this one can see why.  King Crimson often plays &quot;heavy&quot; music without being anywhere near a metal band. It is this trait I see in Tool.  Heavy yet subtle.  A blunt sound.  King Crimson often has delicate moments, not quite so with Tool, more buildups and breakdowns.  The similarity I see is that they have strange song structures and the mood is sometimes ambigous.  Not quite a straight-foreward anger as in a thrash band.  Not quite the overwhelming depression of a doom band.  Some musicians play from the heart, these guys play from the head which may well end up playing with your head.
B00004Z459|5.0|If you can only afford to buy one album this is the one. This album has blown me away, it has everything. No matter what mood you are in there is a track to suit. When i heard one step closer i had to hear more from this group. There are no weak tracks. On some albums there are some tracks you just skip past not with Hybrid Theory. I am sorry if you want me to mention my favourite song but this album has 12 fantastic tracks all brilliant. This has been my favourite album since i bought it. Go and buy it NOW.

6305176299|4.0|I enjoyed the film very much, with the breath-taking action and stunts, the wit, sarcasm and humor in the dialogue, the technicalities of bomb \\"wiring\\", and not to mention the character of Keanu Reeves. I find him very cool and sexy, chewing gum on a bomb disposal job (BTW, do SWAT officers really do that?!), wearing a Casio G-Shock digital watch (can see it close-up when he looked at the time), and sporting that s-h-o-r-t haircut - he is very charming and cute. Keanu looked good in Matrix, but even better in Speed..And who says he is always  deadpan? When his characters are angry, sad, or happy, he projects it enough for me to know that that's his feeling. To me, real deadpan is...Terminator-like. But even then, the \\"deadpan\\" look is what makes his good looks look cool, man.<br />The only thing I find incredible is that by and large, the passengers on the bus were too calm and composed, even after knowing that the bus had a bomb, the 50-mph thing, and gas is running out. I would have expected more anxiety or apprehension among them. But, who cares? Another point is that I find that a certain vulgarity is uttered too often, not only by the villain, but (gasp!) even by the good guys, including, sob!sob! Keanu Reeves. On the whole, the cast have put up a show I enjoyed tremendously, including the perverse ...villain Howard Payne, ...

B000003KMM|5.0|The best baseball movie I have seen so far, great cast, best movie in the major league series.  The best scene in the movie and almost any other movie is when Tom Berenger is up to bat and hits the ball and makes the run to first base near the end of the movie.
B00005BL2A|2.0|I've been waiting 14 years for dm to release a good album.  I'm still waiting!  After the drab Ultra, I was eagerly anticipating Exiter.  What I got was Ultra II.  The songs here, with the exception of one or two, lack the energy of dm's early-mid 80's material... I hate it when bands change just for the sake of changing.  Some \\"music experts\\" call it \\"maturing\\".  I call it starting to suck!  I gave this 2 stars because, while it's beneath dm's standards, it's still better than 99% of the new stuff out the market today.  To explain dm's current affliction, look no further than track no. 8 on this cd (Comatose).
B0000021RB|5.0|The Band Chicago had to have been the greatest band of the century.  Their smooth jazzy sounds are great,and they go from smooth jazz to fast uplifting beats in just seconds!  Buy this Cd, its one that you'll always cherish.  If you don't you'll be missing out on a great thing.
B00005JH7D|5.0|Marcus Miller did it again. About six years ago I was introduced to Marcus Miller(at least I thought so). I did not realize most of the music I listened to,for example Luther Vandross, was really Marcus's work as a producer. His album &quot;The Sun don't Lie&quot; was the first time I had heard Marcus Miller as a solo artist. I was amazed of his work. After listening to M2 I realized this man is no hype! Like many contemporary jazz artists Marcus put several covers on his CD but unlike most musician in that genre he actually gave his own unique interpretations. Also the originals aren't bad either. With guest such as Herbie Hancock ,Chaka Khan, and Raphael Saddiq this CD has something for anyone who really wants to hear some fun funky jazz.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is my first cd by Tool that I had bought.  I bought it after I heard Schism on the radio.  At that point, i wasn't completely impressed, but I thought that it was cool enough.  I took it home and listened to it a couple times.  I Was Completely Blown Away!!!! The songs are all, in a way, beautiful, yet at the same time they are full of anger and despairity.  I kinda thought that the band had spent more time on this cd than on their previous ones, even though I like them a lot.  My favorite songs are &quot;The Grudge&quot;, &quot;Schism&quot;, and &quot;Ticks &amp; Leeches&quot;.  I greatly recommend this cd to anyone who likes music in particular.  They would enjoy it just as much as a hard rock lover, like me, would.

B00005J6UP|5.0|It's about time they released this to DVD. I've watched my VHS tape so many times it looks like the whole movie is set in a cloud.   Other reviews have mentioned the octopus scene, which they MUST include as a special feature, but there were 2 other scenes that didn't make it to the final cut.  There is a scene based in a local/corner/grocery store with mouth, data, mikey, chunk and I think thats it, (only seen it once).  There is another version of the introduction also, which is longer, and shows more car chase and more of the locals, i.e. cheerleaders, football team, mikey, chunk, data, mouth...   These two additions and the octopus were only shown on fox, when goonies made it's T.V. debut, and subsequent tv showings have not included the scenes, (?) I don't have any idea why not. I'm a huge fan of this movie, it has never failed to entertain me. I expect that they will include lots of fun special features, despite the fact that this is a warner brothers release. *W.Bro's usually don't include any special features on their older movies, from the mid 80's or earlier. But whatever the case, this is a must have, good for EVERYONE.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The only way for me to describe this is to put this way: Combine the Beatles and Pink Floyd,and have a 1984/George Orwell theme and you have O.K. Computer.

B00004U8H4|5.0|I watched this movie expecting all of the gore, disgusting thematics, and [sexual content] it was built up to have, but I was pleasnatly suprised to have viewed a highly intelligent, witty, and thought provoking masterwork from Mary Harron. I think the fact that the director was a woman gave it a perspective that a male director, no matter how talented, could not have nailed. Instead of focussing on the acts themselves, which the book was rumored to do, it focusses rather on the arrogance and charm of the person committing those acts. The murders are in the background, not the foreground of the story. The movie may also have ran the risk of glorifying Patrick Bateman, but instead the audience is encouraged to find him shallow, wittless, and soulless. This also makes for very hilarious scenes of awkward encounters, botched murders, sloppy killing sprees, and an attempt at feeding a cat to an ATM (can you say \\"index finger in society's eyeball?\\"). The movie is wonderful. Patrick Bateman did a marvelous job as Bateman, and the supporting cast was delightful. The movie is all around amazing. I can't wait to purchase this one. \\"Do you like, Phill Collins?\\"
B00003XACV|5.0|First of all, I'm a percussionist myself, so I have a natural affinity to this type of music.  Instruments like the vibraphone on \\"Arose\\" and the bells on \\"Walk Home\\" just made me go wow.    And as for the entire score, well it's flawless.  Never before have I found a score as perfect for a movie as this one, not even Gladiator (which is in my opinion better without the movie).  If you knew nothing about American Beauty the movie and you listened to American Beauty the score, if you tried to come up with a story from this music you would create Lester Burnham, the character who is played so perfectly by Kevin Spacey.  I never thought that I would a musical score that fit a movie 100% perfectly.  That is, until I heard American Beauty.  I just can't say how great this was written.  Even when you listen to the tracks for the first time you can tell where in the movie they're used.      The best part about this disc, though, is that it's not just a musical score, it's a symphony all by itself, and also very influential.  When I wrote my final for English, what music did I listen to?  I'll let you guess, but it definitely wasn't Tool (no offense to them, they're magnificent).  Thomas Newman has outdone himself completely with this one.      However, beware this: don't buy it at full price.  Seeing as how it's only 37 minutes long, I would suggest downloading it (which I did) or buying it used [before buying it new]. This music is too beautiful to pass up.
0385501560|4.0|I had been looking forward to the release of Choke after reading all of Palahniuk's previous novels.  I came to him through Fight Club, like many, and have enjoyed the dark humor of Survivor and Invisible Monsters. This book is a must-have for Palahniuk fans - the style of depraved humor and didactic witicisms is intact - \\"Without true chaos, there is no hope for true peace... The laws that keep us safe, they condemn us to true boredom... If things don&#8217;t first get a lot worse, they&#8217;ll never really get better.\\"  Choke is populated with characters who stroll sex addicts anonymous class for partners, randomly abuse a variety of substances, and who can spew an endless variety of bizarre med school tidbits.  On the other hand, this doesn't seem to be the novel that will  break Palahniuk through beyond his already limited audience.  There are a couple of scenes that are simply juvenile, even scatalogical (graphic bowel humor, a flossing scene with flying tidbits that lasts too long, etc.)   In all, I think Chuck Palahniuk brings to the table all the trappings that people wanted to pin on Bret Easton Ellis a few years back.  In my opinion, though, Chuck is funnier, riffs better in his prose, and speaks with a clearer voice...
B000056NX4|5.0|i cannot say enough good things about this film.  it is simply perfect.  glenn carter is absolutely riveting -- his gethsemane gives me chills every time.  what a voice!!  i can't get it out of my head.  but the entire cast is excellent, down to the chorus.  staging is paced just right, and costumes and sets updated for the new millenium -- will appeal to every generation.  my 3 kids have it practically memorized.  if you've never seen this show, get this tape.  it has it all.
B0000508U6|5.0|For those of us who were fans of the late and brilliant Jeff Buckley...there was a noticeable void left in the music world when he drowned tragically back in '97. Who could provide moving meaninful songs,  with wonderful melodies, honest lyrics and deliver it with truly beautiful vocal ability?.....Enter Coldplay....I happened to catch a snippet of the single Yellow on CNN's worldbeat and I remember thinking&quot;this may be something for me&quot;..Then it seemed for the next few weeks, I kept hearing about Coldplay.So, finally, after a few weeks, I capitulated and went and got the  damn cd, lol..And..from the first song on, I was struck by the warmth, honesty, and overall touching beauty of the album.  I put it in and listened to the whole thing straight without skipping or even WANTING to skip one song.  Just like with Buckley, it was love at first listen for me.  This album isnt for everybody......but if u like some brit pop as I do ( i.e  The Sundays, the first Cranberries record, Radiohead, The Verve)..you will LOVE  this record.And for Buckley fans, while there will never EVER be another Jeff Buckley,  Coldplay's lead singer does have his own lilting falsetto that he uses to good effect on the album, all the while never  sounding gimmicky with it.  I think the  theme of the album, for me, is the sincereity of the music...when you listen to it, you get that nice warm feeling inside..I dunno...maybe thats just me, lol..but this album totally takes me back to my college dorm days when as often as not you'd hear a Sundays album blasting from my room while I lay on the bed in a romantic reverie........
B00005ASOC|4.0|I have seen many feel good movies in my lifetime such as Good Will Hunting, Scent of a Woman, Dead Poet's Society, Patch Adams, &amp; Finding Forrester is way up there with them.  The movie is portrayed as a matter-of-factly of a 16 years old African American boy, Jamal living in the Bronx.  He deliberately passed his grades simply rather than excelling in the exams &amp; shooting hoops in order to fit in with his peers but his hidden potential was soon discovered by an elite school in the nation's bursary which offered him a free scholarship.  In a dare with his friends, Jamal sneaked into William Forrester's (depicted brilliantly by Sean Connery) apartment &amp; by accident, a lifelong frienships ensued.  Jamal's significant improvement in his grades raised suspicion from his teacher (potrayed well by Murray Abraham).  As William put to Jamal's succinctly, a good teacher could either be very effective or very dangerous &amp; soon enough, Jamal was at the receiving end of the teacher's wrath for being too good.  Naturally, race issue was touched upon, &amp; the awkwardness of Jamal to date a white woman (acted by Anna Paquin) with a rich background was displayed not by words but by those silent moment &amp; brief glances.  Towards the end, it all came to a climax with a predictable but resounding ending.  A movie that deserved to be savoured slowly &amp; the message shines thru, that if you have a dream, pursue it albeit how late it is as long as you pursue it.  A cameo appearance by an unexpected star which would give the whole meaning to irony.  Rob Brown (who played Jamal), a non actor was believable with his big innocent eyes craving for knowledge, Busta Rhymes played a surprisingly low key character of Jamal's elder brother who wished for nothing but the best for Jamal as he accepted his own fate as a parking attendant at the local stadium, &amp; Sean Connery was simply splendid as always.  A movie that deserved to be stood alone on its merit.  Special features in the DVD are widescreen presentation, English &amp; French subtitles, Dolby Sound, HBO Making of the movie, Rob Brown, deleted choir scenes, theatrical trailers, talent files, interactive menus, production notes, &amp; lastly scene selections.
B00003CXE7|3.0|While I found this movie entertaining, the time between action sequences was filled with a very average story and some pretty cringe-worthy dialogue.  I also thought the fight sequences where a bit too stylised making them very nice to look at but reducing their impact.  Gladiators main movie peer would obviously be Braveheart which a think is a better all-round film, although allot of my friends disagree.  But hey, what do they know!
B00005B36H|5.0|Well, I'm a huge Tool fan. I couldn't wait at all for this cd to come out, so on May 15, 2001, I went and bought this cd. At first listen, I loved it, but still just didn't know how good this cd is. This cd is amazing. The songs are flawless and are extremely well written. Excellent singing, guitar work, bass, and unbelievable drumming from Danny Carey. Aenima was always my favorite cd, and I didn't expect this one to be better...but...this is the first time I've ever said this....I like it better than Aenima. I've never done this before, but I feel like doing a track by track review. 1.The Grudge-Amazing song that rocks very hard, has great drums, interesting lyrics and great instrumental parts. 2.Eon Blue Apocalypse-Just a small guitar solo, it's pretty cool, leads into &quot;The Patient&quot; 3.The Patient-A song that really grows on you. One of the best on here. It's a very pretty song, with some heavy parts, beautiful melodies. 4.Mantra-Scary track, just weird noise, not sure what it is. 5.Schism-Amazing song, the second half of the song is absolutely incredible. 6.Parabol-Very soft and nice, leads into &quot;Parabola&quot; 7.Parabola-Brilliantly written song. The midsection is excellent. The playing is so concise, the singing is bind blowing 8.Ticks and Leaches-Very heavy, with a lot of screaming from Maynard. It is quiet in the middle, then it explodes into an intense anthem. 9.Lateralis-My favorite. This song is one of the best songs ever recorded. The whole song is good, but the second half is just incredible. The end part is so good and it makes you just want to move. 10.Disposition-Great soft song. It starts up the trilogy of songs. 11.Reflection-Great Tool song with an Indian flavor. It's kind of haunting, but the chorus is absolutely beautiful. It's eleven minutes long, it's incredible. 12.Triad-closes up the trilogy of &quot;Disposition&quot;,&quot;Reflection&quot;,and &quot;Triad&quot;. This is an instrumental hard rock song, it's very cool. 13.FaaipDe Oiad-Scary!
B000001Y9I|5.0|What a great comeback cd.They really needed a shot in the arm after making battle rages on,and got it when steve morse came on to play guitar.Steve is a great guitar player but has a very different style then richie blackmore.Ian gillan sounds great on vocals and together they wrote some great songs.Best being the classic sometimes i feel like screaming and rosa`s cantina.This is a must have for any deep purple fan.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Simply a MASTERPIECE of movie making. It was tremendous what Baz Lurhmann &amp; CO. achieved in this film. Moulin Rouge takes viewers into a fantasy world that is so exotic and memorable. GO SEE and EXPERIENCE MOULIN ROUGE!!! You won't forget it.
B000002L1L|2.0|The only reason i gave this a 2 stars is for respect to deep purple.This should not have been made.It has only one good song on it,anya.The rest of this utter junk is a throw away.With a great singer in ian gillan and a great guitar player like blackmore,you wonder how they could have made this joke.Deep purple fans stay away from this lemon,check out deep purple in olympia.
B000059HAI|5.0|Most of the other customer reviews hit the main points I would make about how great this movie is in depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor with historical accuracy.  I am writing this on the weekend of the release of the big Disney movie, Pearl Harbor, which I have not seen yet (I intend to after the crowds subside).  After having invited some friends over for a weekend BBQ, I suggested we watch my new DVD from Amazon, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; and I started the movie half way through, choosing the scene after the film's intermission, basically so we could get right to the battle scenes, since we were mostly a bunch of guys filled with charred meat and beer expecting some action oriented entertainment.  Realizing this was a movie made before I was born, we expected the special effects would be rudimentary, while at the same time appreciated the lack of computer animation.  When those Zero planes buzzed over the harbor, with the torpedoes exploding, the ships on fire, and the airfields bursting into fireballs, we were all screaming with glee and approval.  <br />It's a great war flick, with plenty to soak in.  Of course, the reality of the historical attack and the American tragedy was part of the awe, but so was the grand scale of the explosive film production (watching the stunt men literally run for their lives from flaming airplanes props which went unexpectedly out of control during filming), as well as the visual experience of a sustained, surprise air raid with hundreds of enemy planes buzzing around.<br />I had seen this movie on TV a few times before (usually rerun on December 7), but not without commercial interruptions, and not in  quite a few years.  I am a very satsfied customer having bought this DVD.  I recommend it!
B00000JMG7|5.0|This is a must have for any fan of great guitar rock n roll.MY favorite is disc 1 the live disc.It starts out with the great song calling card and just never lets up.Country mile is another classic.I just wish they would have made this a double live cd as his live stuff was by far his best.He just poured his heart out in the live stuff.If you like this disc,check out live in europe.Rory will always be one of the best guitar players that have ever lived.
0671024256|5.0|If you have no interest in writing, you will probably get very little from this book.  It will offer insight into King's accident in June 1999 and how it has impacted his life and work, but little else will interest you.<br />However, if writing is your bag, &quot;On Writing,&quot; by Stephen King, contains a great deal of valuable advice.  He pulls you away from the technique and into the mindset of a writer during the first section.  Much of this is a memoir on his life, but there is a great deal that an inexperienced writer can draw from.  If nothing else, you will marvel at King's humble beginnings and gain faith that if you are good, you can succeed.  He will also inspire you to draw upon your experience.<br />The second section reveals King's view of what writing is.  This is a download of what the craft means to him as an individual.  This may vary in impact for the reader, depending on how close his vision is to yours, but at minimum it offers a chance to peek into the mind of a legend.  This is the kind of thinking that got him where he is today.<br />The third section is the technical stuff, conversational Strunk and White (which he cites often).  This material can never be repeated too many times to writers, and it offers insight and suggestions for work habits.  It is very clear in this section that writing is as much a part of life as breathing for Stephen King.<br />Overall, &quot;On Writing&quot; is valuable to anyone pursuing the craft.    It reads like a lecture from a master writer, and its insightful, personal prose is sure to be cited for years to come.
B000050FEN|5.0|david fincher is just the best director, this is a great film, if you ain't seen it (why are you reading this?) you should buy it. this isn't finchers best film, that goes to fight club, and the game is also great.
0395078016|5.0|This particular version of Mein Kampf by Ralph Manhein is by far the best.  It captures the true essence of Hitler's thought in a readable, accessable English.  Part of this is due to the fact that it was written before the defeat of the Third Reich, before a great deal of politically correct babble entered the discourse about this important political work.  Hitler's thoughts on International Judaism and the long-term threat it poses to the West come across clearly.  In other translations, Hitler is made out to look like some sort of monster, while Manhein makes clear that he was simply a somewhat misguided German patriot.  A must for anyone trying to understand the real history of the 1933-1945
B00003CXB2|5.0|Of all historical/war films made in the 20th century, I believe this to be the best.  T.E. Lawrence had been a favorite hero of mine long before the movie was made.  I read the Seven Pillars of Wisdom as a teenager in Canada (c. 1949).  The film is brilliantly cast and filmed in the desert locations.  I can think of no one who could have looked the part (height aside) and played the roll of 'Aurence better than the wonderful Peter O'Toole.  (To my knowledge, he has not made one bad, or poor, film during his career).  And the other notable cast members were perfect in their roles.  How David Lean (a superb director) was able to amass the Bedouin tribesmen as he did for this film I find quite amazing.  (Perhaps they were members of the Jordanian army?).  They added a high degree of realism to the story and the action scenes were extremely realistic.<br />When one compares the film storyline to the actual events as they are recorded in Lawrence's books, and those of others, very little literary license was taken by the screenwriters and the director.  The storyline followed the events as they happened with reasonable accuracy; better than most other films of that type.  The producer(s) are to be commended for that.<br />It is a wonderful film about a gifted yet tragic man, his associates and his enemies, which provides a fairly accurate picture of events which took place in the Middle East during the years 1914-1918.  I doubt that such a film on the same subject could be produced again as was David Lean's &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;.  I watch this film many times during a given year - I never tire of it.
B000056K04|5.0|That's right! I did it, I bought this cd. It totally rocks. First you get the song &quot;I Did It&quot; which is a quick, upbeat, and truly Dave Matthews Band material to ballads like &quot;the Space Between.&quot; The rest of the cd is just the same stuff that they have been giving us since the beginning. Just awesome music that is easy on the ears, but can swing your mood from happy to just plain dreamy. There aren't any musical tracks like on their other cds, or what you would hear at their concerts. The Band just makes music that you can listen to while driving on a sunny afternoon, with the radio blaring. I totally would recommend this cd to anyone who is a fan or to anyone who would like a cd just to chill to. I bought it about a week ago, and I reckon that I've already worn it out!!! You have got to love a group that can combine saxaphones, bongos, clarinets, flutes, and violins with the basic band, and get something that doesn't sound like some Yanni and Kenny G hybrid!!!
0060977264|5.0|This story was very interesting because it's about a young lady that falls in lov with his friend from her childhood even though she knew he wanted to be a priest.In this story we saw how hard we have to fight to defend our feelings and how many things you have to lose for something else. In this story they left everything because of love, and that is great because love is hard to find. If both of them love each other it is wonderful that they got together. This story also showedus that we have the power to reach our goal that no body has to be left out in his or her dreams. If we really want something we have to fight for it because no body will fight for us. Pilar was a good example of this because she fought against everything and she triumphed to get together with her love. So we must never give up, that's the main idea of this great story.

THE ENDING OF THE BOOK ALMOST MAKES YOU FEEL THAT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A SERIES OUT OF THE BOOK. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE. I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE BOOK. I ACTUALLY LIKED THE BOOK, AND I'M NOT THAT MUCH OF A READER. THE ONLY WARNING THAT I'LL GIVE YOU IS THAT YOU MIGHT END UP READING THE SEQUAL TO IT BECAUSE THE ENDING KIND OF LEAVES YOU HANGING.

0345363132|5.0|This book is possibly the best book I have ever read. I am currently reading it for what.. the 15th time, I think it is. And I still love it. The story of Richard is absolutely gripping and heartrending, I found myself crying several times at the end, which is something I have never done before. The first part of the book may be at bit slow, but when Richard ascends the throne, the relationship between Richard and Edward described there, forms a large part of the guilt and sadness in Richard's mind which make his death at Redmore Plain seem a bit suicidal. Richard lived 500 years ago, but ms Penman has made him a timeless character, you are not likely to forget. A man, who's greatest virtue became his greatest flaw and destroyed his life. Read the book, and enjoy a truly beautiful tale of real people.
B00004THAY|5.0|This is a great album.  The only song I don't like is &quot;Marry You.&quot;  It's the two of them at their best.  B.B.s voice still works very well, and the guitar licks kick some butt.  Pop open a cool one, and put this CD in the player, and enjoy great music.
B00005B1EX|5.0|This is the Live-Album that Priest Never Gave us...Yes Unleashed is Awesome, but it only covered the beginning of the their career...Halford nails classics like Stained Class,Jawbreaker,Riding on The Wind,and Beyond The Realms of Death. In addition, Halford launches into unheraleded classics such As &quot;Light Comes out of Black&quot; and &quot;Silent Screams&quot; Rob also mixes in the best of his fight days with &quot;Nailed To The Gun&quot; and &quot;Into the Pit&quot;......through in a few never heard studio tracks including a ripper titled &quot;Scream IN the Dark&quot; and you have everything a Priest/Halford fan could ask for.....This release is definetly aimed at Priest/Halford conasuers...so if you remember drving in your Mustang,With The Hair Long, a Cigerette in Mouth, a Girl in Zip Around Jeans in the Passenger seat, and blasting Screaming For Vengence on The Casette Player...buy this album and enjoy!

0060392886|3.0|This was a very entertaining read.  I only give it 3 stars though because I'm a huge motley collector since 1983 and most of this book is old news.  Plus it doesn't ask enough tough questions--and get the answers.  Last time I saw them (Phoenix, AZ) they started a riot, fans got hurt, and Nikki and Tommy were arrested.  Nikki laughs and says that's what rock n roll is about.  No Nikki, that's not a cool thing to do.  And the author should have called you on some of the nonsense you've said.  Not doing enough to hold the band accountable is a biggie in my opinion.  Other than this flaw though, the book is well written.  I like that each member gets to say their piece.  Check it out!
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park it's going to be the best band of it's kind, it's only a matter of time. Just listen to &quot;In the End&quot;, &quot;Papercut&quot; and &quot;Points of Authority&quot; they kick gluteus max!!
B00004XOWM|5.0|I'think this album is one ofthe best rocky rock album of the year 2000. It's mindblowing rock is amazing . I love so much the track &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Rollin&quot;. So I would highly recommend you this album to give a rocky shake to your body. <br />                    &quot;Do you know what you want ?&quot;
0345420128|4.0|<BR>The author gives an overview of lucid dreams, various techniques for inducing them, and advanced material on how to use them once you're having them on a regular basis....<br />The one thing that I didn't like about the book was that he gave dozens of different techniques for bringing about a lucid dream, - but didn't really explain which ones to apply and when and in what combinations.  If one isn't working how long should I stick with it, - a day, a week, a month?<br />However, just for the experience that one lucid dream was worth the price of the book.<BR>
B000056NX5|5.0|This is a moving show about Christ's Life and the Music is THE BEST.  Glenn Carter is a great Jesus and Jerome ? plays a good Judas (Although my sister likes Tony Vincent playing him better, I wonder why)  Tony Vincent has a great voice and it is a shame he is only featured in Simon Zealotes, but he fits his part.  The rest of the crew is fenominal and the music has a great setting to stage.  The only questionable part is the song they added right when Jesus is getting thrown around (I think it's lets start over)  This is a Video/DVD/CD you must own for your collection.  This will put you in back in time in 1BC(?) Oh, and by the way, make sure you have good speakers because you will want to turn up the volume during Superstar and many other brillant songs.

0553106635|5.0|I found this installment of GRRM's series as enthralling and exciting as the first two, and was extremely sad when I reached the last page.  I want the books to go on and on because they are such good reads, yet I also hope for a solid conclusion to the series.<br />After reading all the previous reviews, I find myself agreeing even with those who didn't like it. Martin's writing can be raw and a little shocking if you prefer the PG-13 style of many mainstream sci-fi/fantasy writers.  In addition, he spares none of his characters when it comes to misfortune and setbacks.<br />Having said this, I must admit GRRM is my favorite writer and his writing simply blows me away.  This book is no exception.  It reads more like historical fiction than fantasy, and the plot is complex.  The characters all have warts of one sort or another and are multi-dimensional; sometimes you find yourself hoping that even the less likeable ones will get a decent break.<br />If you like your fantasy a little darker, grittier, and complex, with more human action than wizardry, you will enjoy this incredible book.
0671043919|5.0|I can't say that I couldn't put it down since I didn't read the book, I listened to it.  But I will say that I didn't want to get out of my car.  It was thoroughly engrossing.  I'm not *INTO* war stories, but this was exceptional.  Now I'll have to actually read the unabridged version.
B00005B36H|5.0|Like every Tool album I have listened ot so far (i.e. bought), this record requires (at least for me) a few turns before I can really get into the music. Which is good, because generally my favorite stuff is that which makes me say &quot;Whaaa...?&quot; upon first hearing it.<br />I would definitely say that Lateralus is an &quot;experience&quot;, as it has been said, though I feel &quot;Aenima&quot; deserves the same credit. It is interesting to see in this album how the band has progressed over the years -- musically, they have evolved to sound completely unlike the Tool of &quot;Opiate&quot;. They're more refined. I see a few elements of A Perfect Circle slipping through the cracks, too, msot notably in &quot;The Patient&quot;.<br />I was sort of worried about this album taking so long to be released -- NIN apparently had a similar incubation period and came out of it with their weakest album so far -- but I think Lateralus is just as strong as Tool's previous albums. In other words, buy it.<br />One thing that struck me as odd is that I have not heard a single expletive on this album. Granted, Maynard's words are often hard to decipher, but I really think this record is without cursing. Amazing, considering that most hard rock, especially the angry kind (Lateralus being of mixed emotions), deoends on them. Even Tool, with songs like &quot;Hush&quot;, &quot;Swamp Song&quot;, and &quot;Hooker with a Penis&quot;, normallys uses them frequently. Twenty, thirty years down the line, I could probably listen to this album with my kids in the back seat and not feel like I needed to cover their ears.<br />In the words of Maynard: &quot;Buy my new record. Send more money.&quot;
B00004UEDQ|2.0|**1/2  There comes a time in the career of every performer identified mainly with lightweight romantic comedy roles to take the plunge into more serious acting challenges - in the hopes that we will see beyond his or her pretty face and into the heart of the great actor that resides within.  And strangely enough, many of these actors and actresses choose the same exact route to accomplish this feat - that of portraying a person heavily addicted to drugs and/or alcohol.  This was the case with, for instance, Meg Ryan in \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" and Michael J. Fox in \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" to name just a few.  Now we have Sandra Bullock attempting to stretch her thespian muscles by portraying an alcoholic in \\"28 Days,\\" the tale of a young woman's experiences in a detox center located in a bucolic suburb of New York City.<br />One of the initial problems with such films is that casting such well-known faces in these parts automatically ends up conferring a bit too much glamour on the situation.  And \\"28 Days\\" is no exception.  It's hard to accept Bullock as a particularly credible person in this role.  Still, the movie is generally watchable because it manages to make the people and the rituals at the center seem both utterly addled and emotionally endearing all at the same time.  When Bullock - feisty, close-minded, smug in her sense of superiority - first arrives after being ordered to the center as a part of her probation, we are as appalled as she is by the touch-feely nature of what is going on there.  If anything could keep one from becoming an addict, the threat of being sent to a place like this would just about do it.  But then, as the various characters begin to open up and reveal themselves as true hurting individuals, we, like the Bullock character, begin to be won over.  But even these people aren't given enough screen time to really grow into fully-rounded, complex characters in their own right.<br />The film never entirely breaks out of its TV-movie formula.  We are treated to all the standard plot devices common to the genre:  the inevitable overdose by one of the patients, romantic interludes with a professional baseball player, the clashes between the latter and Bullock's troublemaking boyfriend.  One of the problems with glossy studies of addiction such as this one is that, more often than not, we are led to believe that the \\"cure\\" is a permanent one - not necessarily because the film shows us that (in fact, it makes a few nods in the direction of showing that it ISN'T always permanent) but because the two-hour time frame and the audience demand for a hopeful, upbeat ending inadvertently leave us with that impression.  To be fair to the film, it doesn't tie up all the loose ends into a nice pretty package.  We are given cause for hope, but the open-ended nature of the final scenes suggests properly that the struggle will go on.<br />\\"28 Days\\" is a film with its heart in the right place.  In fact our own hearts go out to it, to Ms. Bullock, to all those involved in its making.  We realize that it is difficult to make a film that, on the one hand, yearns to be an uncompromising study of a subject as gritty as this one, yet, on the other, feels the need to appeal to as wide a mass audience as possible.  The result, unfortunately, is a film that is too lightweight to be taken seriously, too \\"entertaining\\" to be real.formula.  We are treated to all the standard plot devices common to the genre:  the inevitable overdose by one of the patients, romantic interludes with a professional baseball player, the clashes between the latter and Bullock's troublemaking boyfriend.  One of the problems with glossy studies of addiction such as this one is that, more often than not, we are led to believe that the \\"cure\\" is a permanent one - not necessarily because the film shows us that (in fact, it makes a few nods in the direction of showing that it ISN'T always permanent) but because the two-hour time frame and the audience demand for a hopeful, upbeat ending inadvertently leave us with that impression.  To be fair to the film, it doesn't tie up all the loose ends into a nice pretty package.  We are given cause for hope, but the open-ended nature of the final scenes suggests properly that the struggle will go on.<br />\\"28 Days\\" is a film with its heart in the right place.  In fact our own hearts go out to it, to Ms. Bullock, to all those involved in its making.  We realize that it is difficult to make a film that, on the one hand, yearns to be an uncompromising study of a subject as gritty as this one, yet, on the other, feels the need to appeal to as wide a mass audience as possible.  The result, unfortunately, is a film that is too lightweight to be taken seriously, too \\"entertaining\\" to be real.
0385334206|5.0|Breakfast of Champions has to be one of the wittiest and cleverest books I've ever read. Witty for the irrevent, and quite hilarous, first few chapters; clever for the way that the seemingly random plot elements fall together, and the ingenious way in which Vonnegut inserts himself into his own novel. (What would you do if you met your Creater? Ha!) This book doesn't have very much in the way of plot, but then, this is Vonnegut we're talking about here. The story here is really secondary to the social criticism that Vonnegut doles out. Here we get his views on many things (America, slavery, racism, pollution, sex, God) all woven into the story in a clever and entertaining way. Vonnegut has an odd way of keeping you reading, he's not a master of suspense per se, but his books are always hard to put down. For one thing, his prose is always clear and lucid, and the writing is extremely fast-paced, also he drops here and there hints of what is to come in the novel without actually spelling out the details. One would think this would make it pointless and useless to finish the book, but it has, in fact, the opposite effect. I highly reccommend Breakfast of Champions to anyone looking for a good, fast, and funny read, or to those who can appreciate something truly off-kilter.
B00000HZFH|5.0|&quot;Dug&quot; Martsch is one of the most fruitful musical minds in generations.  Since his days with Treepeople he has stretched the edges of modern music, and rejected genres.   His genius has broadened my boundries (kicked the fences down really).  When most other  musicians go off on minutes long guitar solos it is annoying and distasteful, when dug does it, it is trancendental.  When he plays it is not musical masturbation, but the aural evolution of an artist and of modern rock. Since the release of &quot;Keep it like a secret&quot; in 1999, I have listened to it constantly, and it is still exciting and stimulating.  This album has earned a spot next to Peter Gabriel's &quot;Passion&quot; as one of the greatest records of all time!  Built to Spill has joined the likes of P.J. Harvey, Peter Gabriel, The Beatles, and Radiohead as musics' pioneers and Heroes. If you care about Rock music as an Art form, I don't see how you could not Love this record and this band.  But hey, that's just my opinion. If you like this record PLEASE go back and buy their whole catalog (Dug has been at it since '88), and keep buying all the way back to the Treepeople.  Those of us who care owe it to the future of music to support bands like this.
B000001G5H|5.0|All the comments praising this recording are all true. Pollini was born to perform the Etudes. For sound quality this recording is wonderful. The performance is unique. This is one of my favorite CDs of all. Do not hesitate to buy. If you like this, you might also like Hamelin's Godowsky Chopin Etudes. The sound quality is better in that CD with an equally rivetting performance.
B00000AFFI|5.0|this one did take me quite a while. when i first bought i was aware it needed more attention than usual, but like the pansy i am ,i gave up. a couple months later i gave it repeat listens then it just hit me. from intensely beautiful (and sad) songs like &quot;angeline&quot;, &quot;katherine&quot; and &quot;is this desire&quot; to the raw energy of &quot;the sky lit up&quot; and &quot;perfect day elise&quot; this album hits hard. and its unlikely it will leave you....ever.
B000001FS3|4.0|THE JOSHUA TREE is U2's search for meaning in life and, more to the point, the struggle of the band's members to reconcile their strong religious belief with the life of the latter-day Rock stars they had become.<br />Luckily for us they didn't fall into the trap of preaching or posing; they speak to other 30-somethings of their journey through the real world.  At times that journey produces real gems--&quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,&quot; &quot;With Or Without You,&quot; &quot;In God's Country,&quot;--and at other times it serves up nothing more than self-concious rubbish. like &quot;One Tree Hill.&quot;<br />The hits are far more numerous, and far more powerful, than the misses on THE JOSHUA TREE.  Not as opaque as THE UNGFORGETTABLE FIRE, nor as slip-shod as RATTLE &amp; HUM, THE JOSHUA TREE may be the best album from the best Rock band of the 1980s/1990s.

6300270432|3.0|The movie is excellent.  It really rates 5 stars for its strong plot, acting, direction, and camera work.  The theme throughout is honor, and obligation.  But pay attention to the &quot;obligation&quot; part.  There is the notion that we are defined by our obligations, a concept that is vastly different between east and west.  Personally, I think we could use a little more of the Japanese context of obligation in our own society and culture.  And this movie's depiction appeals to something in me that is, admittedly, fundamentally romantic.<br />My problem with the video is this:  there are omissions from this version that were in the first version I saw.  Some footage has been edited out, and although its omission does not adversely affect the story line, it was an effective contribution.  Also, there are sections where subtitles are omitted.  (My most recent viewing was in the company of a friend who speaks Japanese and English, and they provided their own comments regarding the accuracy, not necessarily of the English rendering, but more on what the Japanese &quot;should&quot; have been in the context.)  Mind you, the movie is in English, with some segments of Japanese dialog.  But it was disappointing that some of the most eloquent dialog wasn't even translated.<br />Maybe someone, somewhere, will grant my wish and produce an unexpurgated version on DVD ...
B000002H97|1.0|I cant believe this CD gets the kind of reviews it does because it does not deserve them.I am proud to say this is the last Metallica Albumn I Ever bought.Metallica use to be a great metal band...now they are MTv's best friend,it's sad But true.
B0000028UK|5.0|From the walloping opener &quot;GO&quot;, this baby rocks plain and simple. Eddie Vedder and Co. sound absolutely possessed on this sophomore outing. The production on &quot;VS&quot; is crystal clear, the song selections are inspired, the sequencing is perfectly balanced and it runs just over 46 minutes, so you won't tire of it before the final song &quot;Indifference&quot; plays out. The overall sound of &quot;5 against 1&quot; is pretty eclectic. From acoustic balladry (&quot;Daughter&quot;; great lyrics), relentless thrash (the terrifying &quot;Blood&quot;), playful rockers (&quot;Glorified G&quot;), moody soundscapes (&quot;WMA&quot;,&quot;Indifference&quot;) and just plain good rock'n'roll (&quot;Animal&quot;, &quot;Rearview Mirror&quot;&amp; the bluesy &quot;Dissident&quot;) there's not a bad song in the bunch.  &quot;TEN&quot; may have had bigger hits and made them the darlings of the MTV crowd, but this LP firmly established them as a legitimate 'band' that planned on hanging in for the long haul. A Classic Album.
B000000H3W|4.0|This is Sepulturas last great record.They have tryed to recreate the magic since ARISE but have failed every time.If you are picking up a SEP Cd for the first time I recomend this be the one...Nuff said

0812550706|5.0|this book was truly awesome! I had to read it for school and i thought it was gonna suck but i started it and couldn't put it down!!!!! I read it in 2 days and i think that every one should read this and card's other books!
630407185X|5.0|A Bridge Too Far is one of my favorite war movies, and books of all time.  The book is a classic, which you should read if you have not done so before watching the film.<br />The film is long (almost 3 hours), but well worth it.  I have seen it more than a few times, and always enjoy watching it.  I particularly like the Airborne drop and combat scenes.  All which leave me wondering how they actually filmed some of them.  The cast is full of all-stars with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Robert Redford, Sean Connery, James Caan.  The list of great actors just goes on and on.<br />The film does a good job of telling the tragic tale of Operation Market Garden, the largest Airborne operation ever.  The plan is bold, which is a surprise in itself since General Montgomery was considered to be one of the more conservative well known commanders from WWII.  As you watch the movie, you start to wonder how could they have been so wrong.  Of course, hindsight is 20/20, and you have to realize that this operation was to be the final punch to put Germany out of the war.  Unfortunately, things did not go as planned.  And, in the end, the goal of reaching the Arnhem bridge is never achieved, and the British Airborne Division pays the ultimate price for the plan's failure.<br />The book does a better job telling the stories of individual soldiers involved in the battle.  But, the movie does an excellnet job of keeping the viewer in the action, and aware of what happened when, during the fight.  Especially considering, the action took place at three different areas all at the same time.<br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in WWII, war movies, combat leadership, or airborne operations.  I also recommend watching the movie on a large screen TV if you can.
B00005BL2A|5.0|Very upbeat, at times even humourous especially &quot;The dead of night&quot; and it's room full of Zombie's.  Definitely a departure for Depeche Mode.  Can't really compare it to any of there previous albums. The long dead Soft Cell keep popping up in my thoughts and &quot;Freelove&quot; sounds like an exceptional Erasure song.  This is an album to adore.  Possibly their best.
B00003CXP1|5.0|I saw this film and I said WOW WOW WOW. This is a movie that should be seen by every child that thinks drugs are cool, and by every  person that thinks that drugs are the answer for weight loss. It is a REAL account of what happens not a hollywood happy movie. I was blown away at the performances of everyone in this movie Jared Leto's performance was so beautiful and heart breaking . Ellen Burstyn was robbed at the awards (sorry Julia) but this was a true masterpiece. I can truly say that her performance and this movie changed my thoughts and I will never be the same. This movie is not pretty ...this movie is REAL.  This movie is a must see.
0156421178|5.0|George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia is an amazing look at the Spanish Civil War from one of its participants written within six months of the incidents described.  This is an important book for historians of the period as well as an important piece of writing for those who love the fiction and ideas of Orwell as one can easily see their development through his experiences in Spain.  The sections on the fighting in Barcelona between the Anarchists and the Communists (instead of against their true enemy, the Fascicts) as well as the subsequent suppression of the POUM are among the most riveting.  He is always clear about his personal biases and he is not writing as an historian but as an observer who has been betrayed yet is still hopeful.  The flashes of humour are among the many surprises in this very personal account of the devastation of a country and the growth of a writer.
0671015206|5.0|Stanley and Danko turned an academic consulting endeavor into a fascinating exploration of the world of practical wealth. No, not the Hollywood or other media images of conspicuous consumption, ostentatious displays or gauche noveau riches, but rather the simple, tried and true model of living within your means, staying the course, and valuing wealth accumulation over conspicuous consumption.<br />For those who wan to be wealthy, this is a much better road map than most if not all of the get-rich schemes that seem to better enhance the income of the author of the scheme than it does the wealth of his or her followers (or victims). In fact, Stanley and Danko publish the &quot;secrets of wealth&quot; and ask for nothing in return, proving the adage that a good idea has infinite value.<br />My students, like many people, regularly confuse income with wealth and mistake consumption as an indicator of wealth. Danko and Stanley show otherwise. Like the classic work, &quot;The richest man in Babylon&quot;, the authors study the profile of successful wealth gainers and show how you can do it, with hard work and discipline.
0783114222|4.0|Awesome series, with first class Moon special effects, with some faults (they showed a Soyuz rocket start before Leonov's spacewalk, instead of a Voshod rocket , two different actor plays Pete Conrad), with very good actors, directors (for example Frank Marshall) and composers (Michael Kamen, James Newton Howard and Mason Daring for example). It is dramatic,exciting, interesting and  we can learn some really touching things about these heroes. Without doubt the best episode is the 'Mare Tranquilitatis' about the Apollo 11.<br />It is very kind from the filmmakers to finally show Mr. Werner von Braun who played a major role in the Moon program.  The moonlanding is truly a great success , not just for the Americans but for the whole world. For example I am very proud when I remember that a Hungarian engineer (Ferenc Pavlics) designed the Lunar Roving Vehicle. And as we can see in this series it functioned very well :)<br />It would be very interesting if somebody finally made a mini series (or movie) about the Russian space program (at that time) and we can see that spaceheroes weren't born just in the US, but in Russia too...
0671867369|5.0|Shakespeare had it right: \\"we few, we happy few\\". Ambrose's band of brothers -- the 506th Regiment -- illustrates the success of the common citizen soldier model, drawn from all walks of life, committed to a common ideal, and forged into a unit technically proficient and even more committed to one another. These men loved one another more than they loved life itself, and they made the supreme sacrifice in the name of brotherhood.<br />The story is riveting and tense. Ambrose weaves a great story. He knows soldiering, if only as a historian. He takes you from basic training for the 101st in 1942, through (...)Army procedures, to embarking for Europe, where these men learned that leadership is critical and that it can be measured where it matters most (in the battlefield), as well as in the day-to-day actions of superiors devoted to leading citizen soldiers.<br />One can only marvel at the preparation and courage required to launch an airborne invasion of Europe. For Ambrose's heroes, two years of training led them to one year of fighting across western Europe. Normandy, Market Garden (\\"A bridge too far\\"), the Bulge.<br />Sometimes the leadership isn't immediately apparent. One (...)leader, despised by the men for years, earns their begrudging respect years later, even after an attempted mutiny and a conspiracy to frag (him). And even the softer, comical side of soldiering emerges. The brothers are all human. They make mistakes. They loot. They act on impulse. Yet the closing comment from one of the brothers to his grandson explains it best: \\"I wasn't a hero in the war, but I fought with a lot of them.\\"<br />I can't wait for the HBO mini-series.
6304030959|4.0|this is a great movie to watch.   there are some good laughs and scares for the family.
0786707283|4.0|A Kiss Before Dying follows a man who decides he wants to kill his girlfriend when he finds out she is pregnant with his son. He had already planned to break up with her so when he finds out she is pregnant he believes he won't be able to \\"escape\\" her. His plan of murder is well thought out. He makes it look like suicide. The family of the girl is in complete shock. <br />This is a well written book that holds you in suspense. At the same time it disgusts you that a human would be able to kill someone so violently.
B0000541VS|4.0|I thought this was a good movie but it had a poor DVD! I brought it on DVD hoping it had extra features but it only has the theatrical trailer. I also hate the way that it is double-sided where you have to switch it to the other side. I thought it was a full-screen and widescreen deal but it was just one of those DVD's that you had to get up and switch it to the other side. I hope someday they will release a Special Edition of Sleepers on DVD so that they won't do this dumb double-sided thing. If your planning to buy this movie on DVD don't stick with the video or wait till it comes on TV!
0767814622|1.0|All i want to say about this movie is:It's the most stupid and nonsencial film i've ever seen before.Don't attempt to purchase it otherwise you would be regret.More importantly don't struggle with my country by this way, nevermind we're so patient to endurance.NICE TRY Oliver Stone and Alan Parker.!!!But we haven't been impressed....
B00003CWTI|5.0|I have viewed Magnolia at least five times now and every time it surpasses that last time.  This is one most magnificent movies ever made.  Each and every character stands out.  If you only watch it once and don't understand what it's all about and never try to see it again, you have missed a movie that will be as powerful 50 years from now as it is today.

B00000JGEH|4.0|That line said by Arnold Schwarzenegger himself in James Cameron's &quot;The Terminator&quot; has become one of those classic movie cliches. The movie itself is an original and frightening action/thriller with a dark, grainy look and an '80s feel to it. The scene in the Technoir gives me chills. It moves in slow motion, then becomes fast and explosive. This film made Arnold a star, and he was born to play the &quot;Terminator&quot;. He's chilling, realistic, and scary. At first, he didn't want to play this character of an emotionless cyborg, but after reading the script, he did. It's the role he will be remembered for for years to come.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Sit back and let your mind roll, this is magnificent. After watching this film I was actually proud to be an Aussie for a few days. Although Baz Lurhman sounds like a typically shallow pretentious Sydney boy that good and honest Novocastrians like myself despise, he's actually incredibly clever.  There are moments of sheer, blinding beauty that are overwhelming. The use of the music is incredible and the arrangements of the songs are novel and exciting. As for the editing, at no point was it anything but thrilling. The visual narrative is sumptuous. Ewan Macgregor and Nicole Kidman are luminous; I actually teared up twice not because it was sad but because it's so damn gorgeous. The film is also incredibly funny and just plain fun to sit through. I saw it 3 days ago and I'm still thrilled to bits about it. I kept thinking, at last this is a musical for me, for my generation unburdened by traditional musical theatre narrative, so inventive.  Robbie Hudson
6302610702|5.0|This is a movie you had to see if you are interested of mafia movies. It`s the best ever made.Probably the two best known trilogies in the history are the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy and &quot;The Godfather&quot; trilogy. To look at all three films by Francis Ford Coppola is to look at three examples of films when it is best,of great acting and composition. The first &quot;Godfather&quot; is a true masterpiece, full of so many characters and such a moving story. Marlon Brando is marvellous in probably his best role ever. Marlon Is just what I how I imagien a godfather looks like. It's also a great parable on the son taking over for the father, of a bloody family tradition being passed down the generations.And the funny thing is, even the son who didn't want anything to do with the family business, Michael Corleone, is eventually the one who ends up commanding it. &quot;The Godfather Part 2&quot; is a brilliant look at both the father and son at the same age.In Godfather Part III may not be an equal to the first two, but it undeniably completes the story of Michael Corleone, and it does so splendidly. Its about Michael who will make legall buisness, and find a new Godfather Vincent(Andy Garcia). This saga is a must for anyone who loves movies. Other mafia movies who I recommend is Casino, Goodfellas and the serie Sopranos are my favorits.

0743216458|5.0|This book no doubt is a must read for those who have enjoyed Ambrose's previous books: &quot;D-Day&quot; and &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot;. It seems to be the pivotal thread that ties the other two books together. In fact, if you havent read either &quot;D-Day&quot; or &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot;, then &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is just the book to give you a taste of what Ambrose's others two books are filled with. Either way, the reader of this great book will come out a winner. <br />The more I read Ambrose's books, the more I can attest that he is by far, one, if not the best, WWII writers to pen the greatest testimonials to this great war out there. &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; like his other books, truly creates such a realistic atmosphere, one can actually relate to the soldiers fighting the war. His rich details and use of firsthand accounts allows you to feel what it must have been like for an everyday citizen soldier to inflict pain and be the source of it. The reader is taken to the streets of Antwerp where ferocious street battles are being fought, or to the resting camps where these brave soldiers reflect on what their eyes have seen, both terrible and humanistic.<br />What I especially like about this book was its relative ease in reading. The book is not very long, which makes it fairly quick to finish. Even though the content may not be as long as his other books, Ambrose in no way skips on the vivid images he allows our eyes, minds and hearts to see and feel. I look forward to the HBO movie based off this book. <br />In closure, upon finishing this book, the reader will once again see how horrible war is and how much death and destruction it creates. However, you will also gain a deep appreciation for the sacrifice these everyday soldiers gave to ensure Hitler's tyranny ended. By closely following the tight knit group of soldiers this book describes, we can see their lives unfold from the early days of bootcamp, to the capture and victory felt indrinking Hitler's captured champaign. <br />Enjoy!

0385501560|5.0|Palahniuk is turning out to be my favorite writer of contemporary fiction. This man is amazing. Considering that he could have started courting mainstream acceptance after the movie Fight Club gained so much attention, it's quite nice to see that he is willing to completely out-do himself on the shock-meter. As the introduction says, &quot;You do not want to read this&quot;, then &quot;this is your final warning&quot;. What we have here is another nihilistic look at contemporary American society, and all of the ills that come from trying to fit into its codes and ethics. In the world of Palahniuk, everyone is an addict, simply trying to use their addictions to drown the repetition and misery of the world around them. Victor Mancini, protagonist and sex-addict, knows that what he's doing is not out of love for anyone, but just to feel that he loves people, even if for a brief time. His mother is wasting away in a hospital, and his world seems to be falling apart. His job is the true definition of hell, his friend has become obsessed with rocks, and his true love interest may not be telling him everything. Add to this the possibility that he may be the current incarnation of Jesus and, JESUS! we have a complicated storyline. Yet it is handled with flair and finesse by Palahniuk, whose uniquestyle and structure is on glorius display here. As with all of Palahniuk's books, there is an underlying theme of redemption through breaking free of societal, religous, and familial constraints (sort of like Sartre, but not silly or contradictory). The world is ours once we realize that we alone can change it. Yet another masterpiece from Palahniuk
B00004WEJZ|1.0|As a James Bond fanatic, I purchased all the videos over the years, and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; was part of my collection. However, when I started over with DVD, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; was and still is the only one I had not purchased again - and I won't. Why? It simply does not belong in the James Bond series. Not only because of superficial details such as the absence of the 007 logo and of the usual actors playinq M, Q, and Moneypenney, but also because the film has basic flaws. I could sum them up by saying &quot;Why make a second &quot;Thunderball&quot; when the first one was much better?&quot; In &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, for example, the plot is a much downgraded version of the plot in &quot;Thunderball&quot;, so the director has to fall back on old tricks  like beautiful girls and car chases to keep the audience awake. I will pass quickly on details such as the so-called &quot; state-of-the-art-submarine that threatens the world&quot;... with a hull form that has not been used since the fifties. Sometimes they should know that paying attention to details is necessary in order to create a masterpiece. The humor is not better, and the glass of urine thrown at the face makes me think, once again, of a very bad copycat act. At least, in the movies of the twenties, they threw cream tarts at each other's faces. There is little of interest in that disaster of a movie. If it was meant to be a classic of the genre, we have seen much better. If it was meant to be a parody, which is what I rather think, it falls short of the mark. Why on Earth did Sean Connery get involved in that business?
0517209764|1.0|(This review is of course not on the plays and works themselves which are beyond praise, but on this particular edition).<br />All pieces are packed in two columns, without separating pages, a few ugly frontispices, no table of content. Typography is old, greasy. Looks like the fac-simile of a cheap 19th century edition. No notes, no variants, no references, unpractical to read or to use in study, no added value.  I do not recommend this at all for any purpose.

The premise is, of course, a bit unlikely--the chances that America would ever come under rule of a totalitarian regime could have been said to be slim even at the time that the story was written.  This tends to make what I believe King's point in this story was a bit obvious.  The Long Walk is a metaphor for living--The Major would be God (receiving the adulation of the people who he &quot;torments&quot;), and that, of course, makes for some interesting thinking as to Stebbins' role in this book, but the analogy can continue with relative ease from there.  This doesn't make the book bad--in fact, since he was so up front about the book's underlying meaning (a concept that King was still naive enough to think of as a product of authorial intent) that allowed him to create an interesting and engaging story.  For the casual reader, this is a book that will both provoke thought and provide entertainment.  For my part, I read it in a single sitting (it only seemed appropriate), and all things considered, I can say that I genuinely enjoyed the book.  In view of that, I'd recommend this book to most readers--the only people who should have substantial issue with the writing would be those overly philosophical types who demand that all art have a statement but that it be in no way explicit about saying what it has to say.  A good read to be had by all.
6304696566|5.0|The Searchers is among the finest Westerns ever made. It is so good it's few small flaws tend to stand out. As far as the critisism that it is a racist film: the answer is that yes it is. In fact, that's the whole point. It seeks to hold up a mirror for white Americans. It is not &quot;like&quot; Birth of a Nation, it is, rather, John Ford's version of Birth of a Nation. (There would be some value in watching the two films back-to-back.) But it is a realistic version because Good and Evil, and the admirable and the disgusting, can exist in the same person at the same time. Just like in real life. Neither the good nor the bad in America cancel each other out.  Notice how Ford starts his story: it appears that Ethan Edwards (Wayne) and his sister-in-law are in love with each other, but she chose to marry the brother. Think about that. This film is filled with such contradictions.
B000002JSN|5.0|This album is just superb, ranking with the Beatles' White Album and the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St. for the title of rock's greatest double album. Each pf the three albums displays a varitey of musical generes, performed with the individual group's unique style. However, this album is the most consistent of the three. Only two of the songs could really be considered filler (&quot;Boogie With Stu&quot;, &quot;Black Country Woman&quot;), and even these are entertaining (no &quot;Revolution 9&quot; here). The rest contains some of the greatest rock songs of the mid '70s  - &quot;Kashmir,&quot; &quot;Custard Pie,&quot; &quot;Ten Years Gone.&quot; Even some of the lesser known stuff, like &quot;The Rover&quot; or &quot;Night Flight&quot;, would be great achievements for most bands.
0679721037|3.0|A book should be like a black hole, it should pull the reader in towards it, and leave the reader with a felling of amazement.  Hiroshima did not leave me with that feeling; by the end of the book I felt a sense of disappointment and confusion. Hiroshima is a historical-fiction novel based on the dropping of the Atomic Bomb.  The author, John Hersey, was very confusing and graphic in describing each character's situation throughout the entire novel.  These six characters were introduced to me within one paragraph.  From that point on I was confused, then I became frustrated.  The only reason that I read the book further was because I thought that it would get better and more exciting, but it didn't. The book described each character's reaction to the Atomic Bomb in an unorganized fashion.  For example the book began with Ms. Sasaki being crushed by a bookshelf located behind her; this caused her left leg to break.  Next, we met Mr. Tanimoto, who was unloading clothes at a friend's house when the bomb went off.  Then, the author shifted to Mrs. Nakamura, a tailor's widow, who was in her house at the time of the bombing.  Next, we met Dr. Fujii, who was sitting on a porch in his private hospital when the blast occurred.  Then, Father Kleinsorge a German priest, was introduced, he was in his room when the Atomic Bomb detonated.  After we met Father Kleinsorge, Dr. Sasaki was brought into play, he was carrying a blood sample in the Red Cross Hospital when the bomb went off, and a cinder block wall shielded him.  After reading this incoherent chapter I felt utterly confused. In the follow chapters, instead of explaining what happens to each character, one at a time, the author tells as little as possible about one character before he switches to the next character.  I learned that Mr. Tanimoto avoided the blast by diving behind a rock.  The author then changed to Mrs. Nakamura; who was buried in debris, after digging herself out she then dug her children out of the debris.  She then left her toppled home and preceded with her family to Asano Park, a safe haven for the wounded.  For no apparent reason the author then began to tell us about Father Kleinsorge who, after the bomb exploded, began to pull people from the wreckage.  After less than two pages of discussion about Father Kleinsorge, the author began to talk about Dr. Fujii, who had fallen off his porch into the river, and was pinned between two pieces of timber. Dr. Fujii, after being trapped between the fallen lumber found that his arm was badly injured.  Before I could fully compensate this situation the author \\"pulled a one-eighty on me\\" and began to reiterate what he said earlier about Father Kleinsorge, this time he eluded to how heroic Father Kleinsorge was, and how he helped save his fellow priests and parishioners.   After these brief details, the author began to speak again of Mr. Tanimoto and how he had ran several miles to find the other priests in his congregation to give them aid.  After three pages of discussion about Mr. Tanimoto, Ms. Sasaki was brought into the picture.  She was trapped under the bookcase for a long time, and after being rescued she was left outside in the courtyard, unable to move because of her leg.  Before I could fully understand the graveness of Ms. Sasaki's injury, Dr. Fujii was reintroduced, he was said to have traveled to his parents' roofless house, where he stayed for a few days. Once there he wished he were better so he could tend to the people in Asano Park, but he wasn't.  The \\"last section\\" of chapter-two told of how Mrs. Nakamura, once in Ascano Park, found it extremely difficult to receive food, water, or medical treatment.  Also in this \\"section\\" Father Kleinsorge was told to have been fighting fires in Ascano Park, which were sweeping through the woods.  He also fetched water for the wounded victims who lied helplessly on the ground.  At the end of chapter-two the author talked about Mr. Tanimoto, who went to the riverbank and stole a boat from five dead men. He then began to ferry victims across the river to Asano Park where they would be safe from the raging fire on the opposing side of the riverbank.  The last three chapters of the novel were very incoherent, much like chapter one and two.  Chapter-three was very unorganized, and like chapter-two, the author bounced from character to character.  I found it very difficult to realize the main topic of this chapter.  But after much analysis I realized that it was a chapter about people dealing with the injuries they had sustained, and the losses that they had suffered.  By chapter-four the author hadn't changed his odd style of writing, and still I was confused.  Chapter-four, mainly talked about the effects of the bomb, such as radiation sickness and how it affected each character.  Also chapter-four foreshadowed what lied ahead for or each of the six characters.  Finally, in chapter-five the author became a little bit more orthodox.  In chapter-five the author told what happened to each of the characters after the bomb, and how they rebuilt their lives.  This was a very powerful chapter, and I was able to absorb the full affect because the author didn't bounce from one character to another. The book Hiroshima, because of its layout, was confusing and it had a limited sense of organization.  Even though the book was confusing, it still showed me how senseless the dropping of the Atomic Bomb was and how this destruction affected so many lives.  I would persuade a person not the read this book unless they can pick facts out from the text and keep track of them.  If not, the reader will be utterly confused throughout the entire novel just like I was.
B000055ZDT|5.0|Slower, heavier, and spacier than ever-Electric Wizard. These fellows should do the soundtrack to the next Doom videogame! Their music is criticized as being stoner metal (which is prob very true for the band themselves) but I  say this is some of the freshest space rock i've heard in years. Yes, I said space rock. Headbangers, give this a try. You'll trip out and expand your metal horizens. Altogether the best CD yet by Electric Wizard.  Nuff said.

B00003CXMG|5.0|Cameron Crowe deserved his Oscar for this wonderful movie's delightful screenplay.  Almost Famous is one of those movies that stays with you; it has a big, sweet heart and is chock full of enchanting characters -- from Billy Crudup's deceptive rock and roller, to Kate Hudson's beguiling Penny Lane, to Frances McDormand's wickedly funny portrayal of Mom.  The movie genuinely surprises you, and carries with it the ring of truth, in its situations, its dialog and its depiction of an era in time.  The soundtrack captivates the early 70s rush of rock/pop, and evokes the wistful feeling of adolescence, possibility and yearning -- the perfect complement to Crowe's autobiographical screenplay.
0812550757|5.0|This is probably my favorite novel of the series.  It is, in a lot of ways, the &quot;Empire Stikes Back&quot; of the series.  Bad things happen to good people and the overall mood of the book is one of mystery and impending doom.
B000035P7S|5.0|I must admit I have watched this movie at least ten times. After renting it over and over at the video store, I finally broke down and bought it. I still watch it.  I don't remember why I picked it up at the video store the first time, but I was so very impressed when I watched it.  It is a fascinating love story and very well told. The acting is superb. James Garner is a nice surprise, and of course, Brando is at his best.  It tells a great story of the difficult choice many men faced in the military while stationed in Japan after WWII when they fell in love and wanted to marry their Japanese girlfriends.  I credit all those attached with the film for their wisdom in making this film about love that transcinds racial barriers.

B000059TCE|4.0|When I bought this 2-pack it said widescreen edition in the description (that has been changed now, although when you look at the pic it still says widescreen on both films). 101 Dalmatians was not as good as the first part, which I simply adore. So, if you want widescreen, buy the seperately, and maybe even skip the sequel.

0375500901|4.0|Gabriel Allon is \\"the Kill Artist\\"; a former assassin who worked clandestinely for the Israeli government. When we first meet him he is living in a remote English seaside village and working as an art restorer, a cover he used frequently during his covert operations. He is soon called out of retirement by his former boss, Ari Shamron, head of Israeli intelligence, and a calculating man with his own agenda...one that may cost Gabriel his life. Ari needs Gabriel's talents to track down Tariq, an Palestinian assassin whose killing rampage is threatening the Middle East peace negotiations. Tariq and Gabriel have met before when Gabriel killed Tariq's brother in a very brutal manner, and Tariq avenged that death with a killing of his own...Gabriel's wife and son, making this a story of international intrigue and personal revenge.  The stage is now set for a major showdown, but they must first cover three continents and weave through an array of cultures and characters to find each other. Gabriel is assisted by his former intelligence co-worker, a beautiful French girl named Jacqueline, whose family was killed in the Holocaust. Jacqueline is hesitant to join Gabriel on this assignment, but in the end it is love that prevails, and she plunges head first into Tariq's lair, a deadly trap that Gabriel may not be able to get her out of in time to save her life.<br />What I love about Daniel Silva is his smooth and uncomplicated style. He has a &quot;rhythm&quot; to his writing that hooks you somewhere in the beginning and stays with you long after you finish the book.  It took me a little longer to warm up to these characters, probably because there isn't a lot happening in the way of relationships as there is in his other book _The Mark Of The Assassin_.  Everyone is hiding behind their own specific job and agenda. They're all business. Still, the plot is riveting and the pace is solid.<br />4 and 1/2 stars. Highly recommended. His protagonist doesn't quite involve the readers as in his past works but this is definitely worth a buy.s as in his past works but this is definitely worth a buy.
0060392886|5.0|Finally, I received my of &quot;The Dirt&quot; from Amazon and I knew from various tidbits of information from other sources that I would enjoy this read.  I'm 19 years young now and was not &quot;there&quot; in the 80s when the Motley Crues, Poisons, and Warrants ruled the world, but I grew up on Rock-N-Roll now, and still Love and live it.  Reading this book brought on the entire range of emotions, from laughter and happiness to despair and sadness.  I'm sure if any member of Motley Crue walked past any one of us, that we would probably bow down... or at least be struck in awe, but guess what?  They're four regular guys who had a passion.  A passion for Rock music, a passion for women, a passion for drugs... mostly a passion for EXCESS.  Whether it was good or bad, they were passionate.  I laughed in admiration of the antics of Nikki Sixx as he was growing up, but started feeling bad as his pains and demons of his childhood were haunting him.  And then, something I do not do, I started to cry when I read about Vince Neil and his struggle to cope with his daughter's death.  Yes, we've all seen Behind The Music, but that misses A LOT that this book covers.  Whether you are now, were then, or have always been a Motley Crue fan, buying and reading this book is sort of like a toast... to the most decadent, craziest, and to me, the greatest Rock-N-Roll band of all-time, Motley Crue.  They're just like us... but they never gave in.  Luckily they survived this crash course in Excess 101!  I guarantee if you have any interest in Motley Crue that this book will be read in one sitting.  Told from the perspectives of each Crue member, and various other influential people, the real, uncensored story finally gets revealed.  Don't listen to MY words.  Read it for yourself.
B00003CX7L|5.0|This is the funniest movie ever made. It has comedy, action and romance.
0812589041|4.0|Talk about strange coincidences--right before I read this book I read (and loved) \\"Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone\\".  And for awhile I had to convince myself that it wasn't just a REALLY dark version of the same story.  Two ingenue, whizbang kids; two sets of imperious adult authority figures; two misfits among misfits.  If I'd only watched \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" immediately before reading \\"Harry Potter\\" I'd truly be scared by the similarities.<br />But all this seems like really nebulous coincidence.  \\"Ender's Game\\", on its own, is a fun, if often unsettling, read--one of those books it's easy imagining being turned into a movie (and subsequently ruined on celluloid--do I need to say \\"Battlefield Earth\\" or is everyone on the same page?).  Card's action style is occasionally obtuse--at times I wasn't exactly sure what was going on in a particular battle--but the interpersonal stuff is dead on.  And that is what matters, when it's SF and not battle-heavy Fantasy.  (Yes, I already know there are LOTS of fantasy novels that feature very nice character development--I've read and loved many of them.  George RR Martin, Robert Jordan, RA Salvatore, of course Tolkien...)<br />I also felt the story ended a little abruptly, although I suppose this added to the \\"surprise\\" ending aspect of the book.  I guess I should admire Card for not going the route of other writers, and take 150+ pages to wind a story down.  This was actually a VERY quick read for me.  Books of this length usually take me 3-4 weeks of casual reading; I finished this one in 4 days.  I hate those '70s paperback review cliches, but I'll use them anyway--it is a page-turner, and I couldn't put it down (Damn, I know I'll hate myself in the morning for that....).<br />It helps to have some interest in hard SF and/or military writing (or computer games, for that matter).  If you do, you'll probably  have a nice week reading \\"Ender's Game\\".
B0000524CY|5.0|Scream...not scary Blair Witch...a downright abomination. Too bad the best movie released at the big screen last year was almost thirty years old. No irritating clever teenagers, no one liners, and hot dang some real acting for a change.  If this movie doesn't make your bones chilly you might as well go lie down in the grave and wait.
0451167716|4.0|The book seems to drift in the second half. The section focusing on Lucy, Jules, and Johnny Fontaine just seems a little out of place to me. It's true that those characters connect to plot developments in the second half of the book, but the refocusing away from the Corleones seems to go on too long and in too much detail. Perhaps I just need to read the book a second time to understand why Puzo did this.<br />But there's just no denying the gripping nature of this story. Puzo's narrative is so convincing that it seems to be a description of real people and events. How accurate a picture is this story? I have no idea. But it makes for a great read.

0060392886|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I planned on reading a chapter a day during my lunch breaks, but once I got going I couldn't stop. I love the way it comes at you from all different angles, tying the story together. Vince's chapter about his daughter were so emotional and powerful. I recommend this book to any Cruehead or rock fan. Others might think it's just filthy garbage, but I think it's pretty deep and insightful.

B00005B36H|5.0|Let me start by saying that while the packaging is cool, I was somewhat dissapointed in it. The booklet is interesting, but I was hoping for a real book with crazy pictures and the track listing. What I got was a cover slip with the linear notes and track listings that is fairly hard to read and it is annoying. I hate having to worry about that little film of plastic getting torn or bent, and it is a pain to have to slide it back over the case when I'm done. Luckilly, however, albums are not judged soley on their covers, if this were the case I would rank this a zero. The music is what is, and always has been, important; and it is awesome. The songs are long, most clocking in at over six minutes, and they tend to blur into one another. This blurring makes the album feel like one long song instead of 13 different ones. The guitar bass and drums all sound great. This has to be the best composed album they have, musically and vocally. The songs are softer at times, but they are always brimming with that classic Tool tension; building up to the emminent climax of rage and precision. Upon first listening I was not sure what to make of it. I liked it, but didn't know if it was better than Undertow or Aenima. After further listenings, though, I decided it was at least as good as the other two, if not better.  The sound is similar but different, and even without Maynard's vocals you can tell it is Tool. They have furthered their experimentation into the musical world and should be congratulated for it. This album shows why Tool IS the Pink Floyd of today. Their riffs are melodic and sorrowful, yet ripe with tension and anger.  All in all, a great album, and it isn't as hard as thier other ones thereby encouraging non-Tool fans to take a chance and check it out.
079073639X|2.0|Here's a great concept: a space ship is found under water that crashed here about 300 years ago. More to the great concept: the space ship is one of ours from our future. It came from our future and crashed back to earth in their and our past. Or you could say 300 years ago a space ship crashed on earth, and was discovered now. Think of the possible outcomes, we learn about our future and whatever possible disasters that will happen, alien encounters, how advanced we become, whatever. What we get is a boring Sphere. It has an effect on everyone making them paronoid and hallucinating, who cares. The sphere contains a child like entity. It becomes a horror movie. A great cast wasted. I was very disappointed.

B000002HPV|5.0|In each CD, Bjork never ceases to amaze me.  She always seems to come up with something new and refreshing, and with this CD, she is pouring out every drop of her heart into it.  I can't explain in words just how much of an emotional roller-coaster this CD is, but I'll do my best.  Some may say that some of the songs on this CD are just plain downright annoying and bizarre, such as &quot;Pluto,&quot; but even Pluto just has such an intense beat, and so much emotion in it that you just can't help but love it.  As many have said before me, this isn't just background music.  You actually have to sit down and give your full attention to Bjork to fully enjoy this CD, and then you will fully understand the entire beauty of Bjork's incredible voice and music.  Thank you for this incredible CD, Bjork, and thank you for being different.
B00000K19E|5.0|Well first of all if you haven't seen The Matrix yet then don't sit there reading this review; WATCH THE MOVIE!  It is unbelievable.  The special effects were out of this world, the acting was great, the scenes were well created, and it was one of the most interesting and gripping plots to date.<br />There ws only one thing that I found was a mistake.  In the lobby shootout one of the swat team men was firing his shotgun but it had the sound of an automatic rifle...This movie is deffinately a must have!
B00004TL21|4.0|I never liked metal much, but this CD hit me right into my ears because White Pony is more alternative, experimental, more melodic and at the same time hard, heavy. The first thing I spotted were interesting harmonies and changes in loudness, &quot;heaviness&quot; - like I say: &quot;salto mortale&quot; - that always surprise you. The next thing are drums. I can say that Deftones are masters of rhytm. Just listen for example to Teenager - surprising combination of arythmical drums and guitar that plays it's one rhytm, but they still somehow catch each other and form a brilliant background for Chino's vocal. The text's are also a diamond. They are very metaphorical (Change: &quot;...you change into a fly...I take off your wings...&quot;).<br />What the songs on this CD are lacking is just a little bit more of developing through the song, I mean from the beggining to the end. There's a lot of repeating of the same motiv and when I listen to Pink Maggit I wish all the time to hear something new, a new chord or a new melodic motive.<br />But still I can say that every song on this CD is special and has it's own sense it's own message to be carried to listener and it's always »relistenable«.

6304913176|2.0|This is a story about a pseudo-fascist future earth that is retaliating against a race of giant bugs.  Following the role of some high school students, we track the course of the war in the Space Fleet, in the Marines and the intelligence...  The plot revolves around....<br />Oh never mind.  You don't watch this movie for the plot.  You watch this movie for the incredible special effects, giant man eating space bugs, gore and rather pointless nudity.  Hmmm.... I can see a problem here.<br />I did not find this movie all that appealing - the acting was bad, the plot obvious.  The special effects do deserve a thumbs up as does the concept of this future earth - the propaganda videos are actually quite interesting.  Overall this movie is probably best enjoyed after the consumption of large quanities of alcohol - maybe then the bad acting and camp predictability won't detract quite so much from the overall effect.<br />I would recomend most science fiction movies over this.

0452282152|5.0|It's a good thing I have a book with all of Vermeer's paintings because I had it next to me while reading this book.  It made the experience so much more enjoyable.  I know this book is pure fiction based [very] loosely on the little known facts about Vermeer's life, but that did not detract anything from the book. I liked all the characters with the exception maybe of Vermeer's wife Catharine.  She was a little over the top.  All in all a good read.
B000002INR|5.0|Debut album....... competing with GNR,Def Leppard,Tesla, giants at the time! I was there! My opinon...they blew 'em all away! Hey..Any 80's band that still gets respect on the megadeth chat today, there is a reason! See the boys in skid got labeled pretty boy because of Sebastian's extremely good looks! But the guys couldn't resist the music! Youth gone wild is THE anthem of the late 80's. I pulled this out and listened to it just the other day and this album hasn't lost any of it's rock appeal! It doesn't fit with the whole grunge(don't wash your hair) thing...this is true, but musically it still carries an impact on the listener. Buy this, put it in the stereo,crank it up, turn off the lights ,and return to your youth! A MUST HAVE!!
B00005JIZA|5.0|I just purchased this album on the advice of a music-savvy friend of mine.  It is a great album!  The songwriting is mature, intelligent and solid.  His voice is reminiscent of Dave Matthews, and the style is close to David Gray -- so if you're a fan of either, you'll love John Mayer.  The music has a jazz quality mixed with rock.  I'm telling all my friends to buy his latest album -- this guy is definitely one to watch.
B00005B36H|4.0|I gave this album 4 stars, not 5, as I believe time must pass judgement on what constitues a classic album, and therefore 5 stars. <br />I have listened to this album every day since purchasing it almost two weeks ago, and it continues to rock my world. From the first powerful song, The Grudge, to the disturbing final entry, Faap De Oiad, Tool has raised the bar for excellence. That 30 second howl at the end of The Grudge gets my heart beating every time. <br />Every entry has been carefully crafted to fit into the larger theme, and as a result, you are taken on a 76 minute journey. <br />This album is a clear progression from the  first EP Opiate, to Undertow, past Aenima, and now Lateralus. They have grown both lyrically and musically to a point where they have made an album that both rocks hard, and challenges. The attention to detail, from the album art to the recording quality is excellent. And while no song stands out as a radio, or worse, MTV friendly single, this is as good as it gets for hard rock fans. Not one song is a throw-away.<br />This is most definitley worth owning.

The book not only documents one bands wild and crazy ride through the treachorous music industry but it also documents the lives of four guys with a street born dream from LA to turn the music world upside down.  I can't wait for the pages of book two to be written.  For Mick Mars to shred through the guitar strings, Nikki to lay down the heavy base line, Vince to tear his way through the rock and roll anthems and Tommy, no disresepect to Randy, to rapture the drums in an unending machine of hits!
B00000AFWW|5.0|This album is SOOO completely different from Live Through This it is hard to believe its the same band. While I love their former album to bits Celebrity Skin has everything I wish for in music. Pretty yet powerful. Emotional and cathartic.<br />I guess its sort of a concept album. All the songs address the apparent beauty and promises that life seems to offer on the surface before being disillusioned when expectations on life fail to live up to your dreams. This theme runs consistent whether Courtney is criticising Hollywood (Celebrity Skin, Malibu) the music industry (Awful, Playing Your Song) or when reminiscent on Kurt's death (Reasons To Be Beautiful) and on relationships gone sour (Boys On The Radio, Petals.)<br />Musically, the album ressurects new-wave melodies resembling The Go-Gos, Fleetwood Mac and Cheap Trick and fuses them into dirty, grunge like riffs. The combination of the pretty and the dirty exemplify what this album is all about. Tracks like Awful, Hit So Hard, Malibu and Boys On The Radio sound air lifted from the sun bleached beavhes of California while Dying, Northern Star and Petals evoke a melodramatic sense of pessimism in a true Smashing Pumpkins style (Billy Corgan co-wrote some of the album's tracks his influence is obvious.) Reasons To Be Beautiful, Use Once And Destroy and Playing Your Song are heavy grunge tunes bridging between the power pop of Celebrity Skin and the straight out grunge of Live Through This.<br />Lyrically the album is often hard to come to grips with as it utilizes predominantly metaphoric visual imagery as a vehicle for expression. Although these mental pictures are very powerful, they are repeated too often throughout the album. Expressions like 'crawling under your skin' and 'slain angels' are used in just about every song.<br />Standout trakcs would have to be Malibu, Reasons To Be Beautiful (the juxtaposition between the heavy body of the song and the wishy washy, quiet ending is just so amazing, the intensity in this song just seems to seep through into yoru soul) Boys On The Radio (one of my favorite ever songs, distortion and a slightly syncopated bass never sounded so good, Playing Your Song and Petals (breathtaking.)<br />I could go on for hours about Celbrity Skin, but there's no point. At the end of the day, I couldn't reccomend this album more. Brilliant
0812550706|4.0|This typical sci-fi, fantasy novel by Card has unique qualities that only this book has; however, those qualities are sometimes negative.  Ender's Game tells a story just through dialogue between supporting characters; the events support the conversations.  As much as it is unique and interesting, the words are hard to understand, as the vocabulary is not exactly orthodox.  <br />The plot of the story is well-balanced; every event is reasonable.  This story ends with a slight twist, as Ender Wiggin finds out what he really is doing.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This cd is so cool i can´t discribe it!!<br />Thank you
B00005B36H|5.0|First of all why is everyone bitching about it being mellow(it's far from mellow). The \\"mellowness\\" is a progression, for example look at opiate and undertow, when I first got undertow after opiate I thought, \\"What (...)it's so soft. this sucks\\" and sure enough after a couple listens, I thought it was their best, then I heard Aenima... Second of all you do not have to consider Lateralus to be their best in order to like it. It is a beautiful album, and in my opinion, after repeated listens of course, I think it is their best album. I can't even go back to Aenima now, I feel it's dry. Lateralus has a life of it's own, and it grows on you. Wether you want it to or not.
0385484518|1.0|The emotions described here have all the weight and sincerity of drugstore greeting cards.  The author is a TV sportswriter and it shows.  I believe that the author had some genuine affection and devotion for Morrie, but he has not successfully captured that here.  Instead, his prose comes across as shallow, manipulative and insincere.  If I were the author, I'd take a year off and go live by myself in a remote cabin and re-write this book, ripping each word from my heart.  This book here is just too facile, too TV-esque.  The only thing that the author seems truly heartfuelt about is the awe in which he holds Ted Koppel and the Nightline program.
B00005A3KS|4.0|This one skims along wihtout missing a beat, happily aware of its own implausibilities.  Possessing cliches in spades, &quot;Point Break&quot; somehow manages to walk a very precarious line--surviving, even thriving, in open defiance of its own plot holes and Keanu Reeves.  Reeves takes a lot of heat for his acting ability (or lack thereof), but movies like &quot;Point Break&quot; prove that in the right circumstances, he can excel.  No heavy thought required here--Reeves is right (dare I say perfect?) for the role of almost emotionally blank FBI cowboy Johnny Utah, while Gary Busey as his crusty partner stereotype (this guy in the FBI? Yeah, right!) also fits right in.  &quot;Point Break&quot; is an engine disguised as a film, but unlike the computer-generated excesses of today, it actually delivers the consistent, almost effortless adrenaline rush that action movies should without numbing you with pyrotechnics and digital deception.  One of the last really good action movies Hollywood produced.
B00000ILBK|5.0|I went to see this one with a bunch of Star Wars fans (though their faith in the Force had just been shaken a little; they'd just seen _Episode 1: The Phantom Menace_).  I came out of the theatre with a bunch of Star Trek fans. <br />Perhaps the best aspect of this film was its brave decision to focus on a moral issue, and on character, rather than &quot;bigness&quot;. <br />The film concerns genocide. But it chose not to use easy filmic ways of getting an audience &quot;involved&quot;.  For example, the film could have shown victims being killed on-screen in horrible ways, or mutilated while vital fluids and key bodily organs are ripped out of their bodies.  That would work.  But instead the means of genocide was more subtle: destruction of an environment. <br />And where an audience might be bludgeoned into caring by being told that the issue involves a &quot;planet&quot;, say, or &quot;the [fill in Trek name] system&quot;, or - what the hell - the 17,000* worlds of the Klingon Empire, instead _Insurrection_ has its story about a group of just two or three hundred people. As Picard says, the issues are still the same. <br />I think, on skimming the negative reviews here, that where people were disappointed it was generally by the decision to keep this movie small and relatively intimate. Me, I thought it was a great decision. <br />I also felt that this was the best paced of the films since _VI: The Undiscovered Country_. _Generations_ is unfortunately a dull outing, and while long stretches of _First Contact_ are among the best Star Trek ever filmed (ie everything short on board the Enterprise) there were also long stretches where the film bogged down (ie more or less everything shot on 22nd century Earth). <br />_Insurrection_ by contrast keeps things moving forward throughout in an evenly paced linear story. The pauses for comedy and romance generally don't pause long enough to become mawkish or otherwise embarrassing. <br />A slight drawback for me was the excessive sweetness of the Ba'ku scenes. They looked like models in a brochure for a Californian Club Med - this is NOT a compliment - , and their New Age dialogue too often grated. The saving grace is that these moments were kept short. And though the score had its moments, being generally better in space than when describing pastoral paradises on the planet, it was not one of this series' best efforts. (An oddity of Star Trek is that the worst films, eg 1 and V, often have the best scores, while the best films eg VI and this one, have relatively undistinguished music.) <br />The romance between Picard and Anij is one of the best and most natural Trek romances. That's no praise at all, come to think of it, romance being something Trek is spectacularly bad at. I meant it is a believable and moderately appealing romance. (Shame on Paramount for cutting Picard's screen kiss, by the way. The moment where it was so obviously cut leaves us literally in the lurch. Still, no doubt their marketing people were coming back into control at a late stage in the editing; they figured teenage boys wouldn't have liked it.) <br />Anyway, in sum, this is one of the best Trek movies. It's one of the films I might show to a non-Trek fan, to show some of the series' charm. And although I liked _First Contact_ very much indeed, I actually preferred this film, overall. Recommended...<br />Cheers!<br />Laon<br />* The 17,000 worlds of the Klingon empire?  Of course I have no idea how big the Klingon empire is.  I have bits of a life, and I refuse to know things like that...
B00005BL2A|4.0|I must admit, I had my doubts about this album when I first played it. This didn't sound at all like the DM that I was used to. I missed the gospel tone of SOFD and the dark shroud of Ultra. &quot;Dream On&quot; just didn't jump out like other singles had to me. However, after a few more spins, I was hooked. I was determined to give one of my favorite bands the chance they deserved. And I'm so glad I did. Granted, I'm not in love with every song on this cd (hence the 4 stars), but as any true DM fan would agree, this is an outstanding effort for a band that has gone through so much adversity. Losing Alan Wilder (despite the politics within the band), was a musical blow. Not to mention Dave's unrelenting personal problems and Andrew Fletchers on/off member status. This would be the end of most bands today. Perhaps that is what keeps them together and makes the music so unique. The tour should be a blast!
B00005BL2A|5.0|I am a fan of black/death/industrial heavy metal music, and i thought i would hate this cd. Well, I bought it, and I LOVE IT. THis cd has some great songs, and it is just a perfect cd. From the first track, to the last, every song is good. THe dead of night is similar to nin, and it is the heaviest on the cd. THe cd it self, is really slow and depressing,and the focus is love and heartbrake, but i liked it alot. Im not a fan of depeche mode, but now i am. This is a great cd that is good to listen to when you are feeling down or in love. Get it, trust me, you will not be disappointed. If you are a music fan, you must have this in your collection. End of story.
B00004XQ83|5.0|i'm not your typical fan of bluegrass or country music.  not even close.  i was first introduced to this music on an overseas plane flight where this was one of the movies playing.  i ended up watching the film 3 times (not because it was that great, but because of the music!)  i ended up buying the cd on the drive home from the airport.<br />and what a purchase.  there are songs on the cd that could best be described as heavenly - notably anything with allison krauss singing.  two particular standouts are \\"down to the river to pray\\" and \\"didn't leave nobody but the baby.\\"  i worry that i'll wear out my cd by constantly playing those tracks...<br />another standout - with two versions on the soundtrack - is \\"man of constant sorrow\\"<br />i can' even begin to explain how surprised i was that i enjoyed this cd so much.  this type of music isn' something i would even consider exploring and to find myself enjoying it so much was a shock.
6305827079|5.0|Elvis That's The Way It Is, is not the same of the other movies he made. This time Elvis Presley plays himself. Elvis made this movie for MGM. The movie mostly shows him in Las Vegas to a show. <br />Elvis Presley does sing in this movie, and he does more of the time. Some or more of the songs in this movie, you might have heard him sing. The songs includes Polk Salad Annie, Little Sister, That's All Right, Patch It Up, Blue Suede Shoes, Heartbreak Hotel and others.<br />He aslo sings, Love Me Tender, All Shook Up, Bridge Over Troubled Water (Did he really recored Bridge Over Troubled Water?), Suspicious Minds, The Next Step Is Love, What'd I say, and Can't Help Falling In Love.<br />Elvis fans can't help falling in love with Elvis. The movie runs about 1 hour and 47 minutes. But in this Special Edition, there are songs that was lost to the fans, until this year. It is like watching a movie on dvd. And you might be watching it on dvd. I don't know that about 31 years ago if Elvis Presey would have know that this was going to turn into a Special Edition some day. And it did.
B000059XYM|1.0|i watched the trailer,and i was realy looking forward to see this movie.It seemed the most funny movie,i laughed a lot.Then i went to watch the movie.I was never embarassed in my whole life!!the whole flick is about male genitalia,some scenes it was even disgusting..And it wasnt funny at all.If you have some brain and moral avoid it at all costs! zero stars
B00004XOWM|2.0|Three Dollar Bill was awesome heavy rap/rock! Significant Other was really good too, but its sound was starting to lean towards the next album... Chocolate Starfish!<br />Let's see, where to begin.<br />&quot;Hot Dog&quot; is good and sorta funny, but did they have to rat on NIN? &quot;Full Nelson&quot; is ok, but the lyrics are overall very simple. &quot;Livin' it Up&quot; is also ok, but only for the first third of it. &quot;Take a Look Around&quot; is good. &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; and the Urban Assault version of &quot;Rollin'&quot; are perhaps my favorites, only because the guest rappers' lyrics make a fool out of Fred.  In fact, this album might have inspired me to look at Xzibit.<br />The rest of the songs are childish, repetitive, stuck-up, and annoying.  This is a terrible way for such an awesome band to end.  I keep thinking how much better these songs would be if more time and thought had been taken on them. Even I could write better lyrics.  Let's hope LB doesn't get stuck in this muddy rut.
B00005K9LN|5.0|I think this album is great, breaking the law is one of the greatest 80's rock song I think I have ever heard.  The guitar riffs, and head banging hard rock sounds just make me want to mosh.  And that is just one song, wait till you hear the others, they will nock you out of your chains and ear rings.  This is an excellent album, if you like Ozzy and Twisted Sister, this is the album for you.
B00000099Y|4.0|TOOL is probably the heaviest band I listen to. I admit I am a new fan (I've only listened to them for a few months) and I don't yet own OPIATE. One thing I do know is that on the radio, my favorite song right now is &quot;Schism&quot; from Lateralus. This one's kinda in the mood of hate, wanting God to &quot;flush it down&quot;. Then there's some songs I thought were real funny like &quot;Hooker With A Pen_s. You just gotta listen to judge. The intermission, well it's an intermission. You should know the greatness of &quot;H.&quot;, one of the less angry songs, but still angry. It's actually melodic, too.<br />One great moment is that it starts out with the single, &quot;Stinkfist,&quot; one of Aenima's greatest offerings. And &quot;Aenema&quot; (isn't that how it's spelled, for the song?) is awesome, though if you get offended by explicit language, I don't necessarily recommend it to you. Some other songs are notable such as Forty Six &amp; 2 and Cesaro Summability. If you like German, try &quot;Die Eier Von Satan&quot;. That's what makes it a classic. <br />(I purposely gave a 4-star review)<br />Though I don't own LATERALUS, I'm pretty sure it's a lot better of a five-year comeback than Metallica did with Load, but The Fragile by NIN is one I'm thinking it's more of an aim for.<br />So if you want original heavy metal rather than cliched with posers, buy this.
B00003CXA2|1.0|You know, it is a sweet, endearing movie and yet at the same time it kicks us while we're down.<br />It seems that all of the characters that have fallen on hard times due to the bad decisions that they make SHOULD be pitied because quite frankly, Forrest Gump NEVER should be.<br />What am I driving at?<br />Let's face it--this movie is not a triumph of human will over adversity.  All of Gump's successes and triumphs are more about circumstance than actual effort.  Case in point:  Gump's shrimp outfit soars...only because every other shrimping vessel was laid waste while his ship miraculously survived.  Is this something that we should applaud--Gump's triumph over the misfortune of others?  Like I said, it's hard to find a story likeable about someone who doesn't know any better succeeding where other WHO DO TRY fail...and fail miserably.  That's not to say that those who failed didn't deserve to.  Jenny is an example of that, but for crying out loud, she was REAL in her intentions and decisions.  <br />I don't think the film deserves the same amount of success that Gump himself experiences.  Hanks is a brilliant actor and this film is no exception...but if life is a box of chocolates, then this film is a 10-year old nougat left in a puddle on the road.
6305776326|3.0|Comedienne Molly Shannon recreates her Saturday Night Live character, Mary Katherine Gallagher, the gawky catholic school girl, for the big screen. At times, the film is very funny. Unfortunately, it is not very funny as often as one would like. What works great as a five minute skit on Saturday Night Live does not necessarily make for a great full length, feature film, even though quite a few of the Saturday Night Live regulars have parts in it.<br />The film revolves around Mary Katherine Gallagher and her attempts to fit in and make the most popular boy in the school want her the way she wants him. She also wants to be a superstar in the worst way, even though her grandmother with whom she lives wants her to become a business woman. She does get her big break, however, when her school has a talent contest.<br />Some of the funniest scenes in the movie occur when Mary Katherine, absorbed in her romantic fantasies and impervious to her surroundings, has a one sided conversation with an apparent fantasy lover for whom she substitutes a tree as a stand in. At times, she even acts out her romantic fantasy with the tree. Imagine it with a nun standing in the background observing Mary Katherine. It is hilarious. Unfortunately, those moments are few and far between. Still, if you are a Mary Katherine Gallagher fan, you will enjoy the film. If not, you may be disappointed.
0805062971|5.0|Not like other books, this book pulls you under water right at the begining and pulls you out at the end gasping for air. The way Chuck P. writes this book is so different then all other authors. I don't usually read and this book got me back to reading.
0060920084|2.0|While humorous at times, the book seems to be an endless dialouge of Mr. Bryson's dissappointment of small town America. The author does a good job of describing the countless towns he visits enabling the reader to be an armchair traveller with a good view of life in U.S., but I found myself depressed at the end of each chapter as he conveys his distaste for the people, food, accomidations and atmosphere of every town he visits.<br />If you want Bryson at his best read A Walk In The Woods, a &quot;pee-your-pants&quot; funny book of his travels on the Appalachian Trail
0385474547|1.0|I have put off reading this book since my college days but felt that I should give it a try since I see it on so many must-read lists for literature.  What a waste of time.  The story was dry and boring and never captured my interest.  The only reason that I finished it was because it was only 207 pages, so I decided to just suffer through it.  A classic?  Not in my book.
B00005ASOC|5.0|What a good movie... but the music is Excelent! i recomend everybody to buy the soundtrack of this movie, the amazing tune OVER THE RAINBOW/WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD is only one of a very fine selection of music! (reviews at the cd section). The history have a lots of cliches, but the cast is so perfect that you can forget/forgive those cliches easily. I like this kind of movies, Im from Venezuela and my mother language is not the english (as you can guess!) but the idioms and particularly the english can have a rhythm that you can really enjoy like in this movie, from slang to the &quot;educated english&quot; the experience is enhaced thanks to this. In the same way the adventure of finding the infinite posibilities of the human being is portrayed sincerely like Forrester said &quot;...he only helped Jamal to find his own words&quot; truely i think that to write builds a bridge between all kind of people. Perfect if after you watch it you write something and share it with a friend.
6305909326|5.0|There isn't a single &quot;good&quot; character in this video, which is why I loved it.  The obligatory Hollywood love interest is Satan!  What's not to love?  If you're the type who roots for the bad guy in movies then buy this.
6303347657|4.0|This film is funny, first of all. It is a parody of so many other films that it has very little deep meaning but it is only an entertaining « action » film. It is a parody of old cartoons, of gangster films, of maffia films, of bank robbery films, of Batman or Spiderman films, of whatever. But the concoction that is delivered to us is absolutely delicious. Then the deeper meaning that a mask can only help us to reveal our deeper being by lifting the artificial mask society sets on us is rather shallow and in no way studied in any depth. But that is not the interest of the film which is, as I have already said, nothing but a funny entertainment. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.
B000059HAI|5.0|Simply put Tora, Tora, Tora is number one in the Pearl Harbor category.  The new Pearl Harbor is another new disappointment and a BIG missed opportunity to create a powerful/well conceived storyline and properly utilize and apply fantastic technical, research and special effects resources never before available to 'recreate history'.  Recommendation: Don't waste your time and money seeing it in the theatre - wait to rent a video. (Exception: If you have a hot date that is just begging to see it.)  Sure, the new Pearl Harbor will please the masses - the general public.  But if you really want to know what it was like - get this 1970s movie. Sure, like Private Ryan, it's not perfect. To most people a perfect war movie would be mostly boring and unglamorous with periodic scenes of appalling subject matter. Tora, Tora, Tora is a classic war movie that comes very close to the historical and technical accuracy that you can't possibly focus on when you cloud it up with a love story, typical Hollywood inaccuracies in dialogue between military personnel, errors in casting, tons of scenes borrowed from other movies, some overdone  digital effects, military technical errors and a tremendous missed opportunity to 'build up' to what most people consider the main part of the movie - the attack!! Too bad, the public could appreciate another 'Private Ryan' quality movie.  The critics will never totally denounce the new movie because it would be politically incorrect and probably be miss-interpreted as Anti-American by the public.  Pearl Harbor is still an emotional issue with Americans - therefore the advertising hype on the new movie has reached ridiculous levels - don't get sucked in.  Once more people see it, they are going to either be disappointed or clueless. See Tora Tora Tora - whether for the first time or revisiting it, it's an excellent piece of work.
0553579908|4.0|Dense with plot and characters.  Well written.  Vivid.  Consistent.  Bloody.  Involving.  Entertaining.  Sorrowful.  Smart.<br />These books are poised to become fiction/fantasy classics.  I picked up the first on a whim (because I don't normally read this genre), and quickly moved through the second, then bought the third.  Very well done.
6305263248|5.0|This movie is awesome between the car chases and shoot outs it offers everything an action movie enthusiast could want. Plus, the movie comes in both widescreen and fullscreen aspect ratios. So if you feel like watching the movie in fullscreen rather than letterbox go right ahead!
B000007OY0|2.0|I've seen this movie on television several times and enjoyed it greatly.  A good story of triumph over adversity, however when I purchased the video I was greatly disappointed because the notorious &quot; F &quot; word ruined the writing for me and the acting as far as I'm concerened.  Thats all I could see or hear and it ruined the quality of the movie for me, my husband didn't even enjoy it as much.  It's a shame that a briliiant actor and director had to fall victum to the use of vile language when it was proven by the television version that it was completely unnecessary to the impact and story line.
B000056K04|4.0|Okay, there are plenty of reviews out there.  No one really needs mine.  I don't have anything earth shattering to say.  Do I like this CD?  Yes.  A lot?  Yes.  Do I think it has some flaws? Yes.  Are they forgiveable?  Yes.<br />As I see, this CD is being disparaged and lauded (well, at least enjoyed) by different factions for one reason:  it is listenable.  A virtue and a vice.  But which is it more??  Depends on you.  <br />I like it.   You be the one that decides if you do.
0393312836|5.0|after seeing 'a clockwork orange' many times on film i thought i would try the novel.i have found it to be the best book i have ever read.Burgess completely captivates you with his use of innovative language and the way he tells the story through alex.even after alex's diabolical acts,the novel still calls for the reader to have symathy for him when he is being tortured by the state.very challenging in it's time but it has always been a fantastic novel.

078062999X|4.0|Having seen two theatrical productions and two other film versions of this timeless Shakespeare play, I was duly impressed by this highly ambitious cinematic effort to film 'Hamlet' in its entirety.  The visuals are incredible--set in a 19th-century palace and shot with 70mm film, it is not to be missed (and, indeed, I recommend the widescreen version if your television is large enough).  The cinematic feel of the film works well also; whereas a major flaw with other films of this play is that they simply feel like a grand theatrical production, Kenneth Branagh makes this film a truly engrossing spectacle.  To see Fortinbras' army bursting through all the mirrored doors in the throne room is something not to be missed, Hamlet yelling his 'How all occasions do inform against me' soliloquy at the top of his lungs atop a glacier is unusual and spectatular, and Hamlet's meeting with his father's ghost is simply terrifying.      Most of the roles are pretty well cast--Kate Winslet is a very good Ophelia, Derek Jacobi makes a great Claudius, and Billy Crystal even makes a delightful appearance as a gravedigger.  Branagh sometimes leaves something to be deisred in his title role--the soliloquy is a mumbled monotone (though very well shot!)--and why the heck is Jack Lemmon, a great comedic actor, playing Marcellus?  Robin Williams at first makes a good Osric with his natural comic charms, but is completely incongrous in some of his actions (for which I suppose we can blame the director).  But the only really big problem with this film was the soundtrack: while at times it helped get the mood of the scene, it sometimes became a hindrance in some of the conversations and soliloquies.  But, one cannot ask for everything, and if you are looking for a good Shakespearean film adaptation, I hightly recommend this to you.
B00005B36H|5.0|I am a fairly new fan of Tool.I first heard Aenima about a year ago and it grew on me immediatly. I am a big fan of the progressive era of rock....Yes, Rush, King Crimson, Early-Genesis and like some heavy stuff too......Tool takes progressive rock to a new height. They have a haunting, heavy and delicate sound all their own. Within the first moments of &quot;The Grudge&quot; you can see that their musical vocabularies and songwriting skills have evolved from Aenima much like Aenima did from Undertow. This music is not heavy metal or industrial rock......it is much more progresssive yet has soul....it is not technical for technicality sake....Tool is a new voice....
B00005B36H|5.0|I never thought about posting my review about any album in here. Usually, I just share my opinions with a group of friends, because I don't care about what other people think. Everyone has the right to hear what they want.<br />But after listening again to Lateralus, I felt compelled to write something about this brilliant work. <br />This is all about progressive rock... but better!! I've heard to a lot of bands like Soft Machine, King Crimson, Yes, Van der Graaf Generator, Genesis and Gentle Giant (I didn't include here Pink Floyd because I don't consider their music prog-rock... but they're actually one of my favourite bands). Right now, I really think that Tool compares to these monsters and actually adds something new and better to them!<br />These old (and excellent) prog-rock bands were all about &quot;math music&quot; and great harmonic/melodic sequences made by and to &quot;musicianships&quot;. But, most of the times, people didn't quite understand what kind of emotions they were dealing with (perhaps because sometimes there wasn't any), so people often considered that kind of music boring.<br />But Tool really made something new. They added emotions. Lateralus was thought and felt. It's a guide line. Following your emotions you don't have to be studied to understand their work... or art.<br />So, maybe Lateralus will work as a great eye-opener to all music fans out there. Maybe it will teach them the great ways of music. You don't have to be like everyone else. You don't have to make that traditional verse/la-la-la chorus/verse format music. You can really do something musically, work on something different, develop different structures and time signatures and really create emotions on your listeners and develop the moods you want. <br />Keenan, Jones, Chancellor and Carey do all that. They're above anything else. Please don't compare them to any other band that still makes music. Even comparisons with Barrett, Mason, Wright, Waters &amp; Gilmour or with Wyatt, Ratledge &amp; Hopper sounds unfair... to Tool. Because they're unique in their time. <br />There's a guy out there that's trying to prove to the world he's got something more inside his head then he really does. But he's working hard. He said: &quot;Tool's probably the best band, I think, on the planet. There's something wrong with those guys. They're too good. They know something the rest of the world doesn't know... I can't even be in a category with that band&quot;. Well... you're right, Mr. Durst. It's their way.
B00005B7CK|5.0|\\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\" does a fine job building up a reservoir of good faith.  From the first shot of Our Heroes emerging from the wheat field, to Clooney's curious predilection for a certain brand of pomade, to the lovably sweet mug of Tim Blake Nelson, you just know that a rocking good time is going to be had by all.  That's what I mean by good faith.  And it's a good thing it works so hard at building it up, because it nearly runs out of it in the end.  Luckily, the closing credits pop up just in time.<br />Not being expertly familiar with \\"The Odyssey\\" (my English degree hides its eyes in shame), I only got the most obvious of the movie's Ulyssean references (e.g., Clooney's name; an eyepatched John Goodman as the Cyclops; the Sirens).  Don't think it mattered much, though.  It does help if you look at the story as something mythic rather than something realistic.  Suspend that disbelief, and you shall reap entertainment.<br />The Coen's pay a lot of attention to making the land being traversed optimal for this particular quest.  The terrain flows from arid squalor to lush greenery, from the isolatedly rural to the hecticly urban, and the cinematography is apropos in each setting.  It's also quite gorgeous.  It's not as cartoonish as, say, \\"Raising Arizona\\", but the Coen's sure know how to frame a comedic shot and sequence.<br />George Clooney, as the loquacious leader, is miles away from anything else he's done.  I've heard it time and time again that he is a one-note actor, given to hanging his head in a grating, sheepdoggish manner (I call this the `Doug Ross Tilt'), hoping for your forgiveness but not really sorry.  Well, he does none of that here.  Instead, he bugs out his eyes, messes up his hair, and screams like a little girl.  It's a great comedic performance.  He's ably backed up by Coen regular John Turturro, who appears to be a ragged collection of arms and legs and teeth, and Tim Blake Nelson.  I was surprised to learn that Nelson is also a playwright, screenwriter, and director.  Surprised because his Delmar is \\"dumber than a bag of hammers\\", but blessed with so much pure folksy wisdom that you just fall in love with him.  There are some moments when he is caught with just the most blissful look on his face.  They say more than any dialogue ever could.  Bless the Coen's heart for letting them do just that.  Also on hand here filling out the minor roles are Coen veterans John Goodman (a big and blustery bible salesman) and Holly Hunter (as Clooney's [ex-]wife), as well as prodigious scenery chewer Charles Durning (as the incumbent governor of Mississippi) and the underrated Stephen Root (as a blind recording engineer).<br />Helping to flesh out the movie is a soundtrack packed with and abundance of \\"good-timey\\" country-bluegrass classics.  Tops amongst them are Clooney and the boys joined by a Robert Johnson-like guitar player (they pick him up at the crossroads, natch), recording a song as `the Soggy Bottom Boys'.  Their song is supposed to become a huge hit in the narrative, and it's such a joyous number that I can truly see that happening.  And watching them perform it live (twice!) is such a treat, especially since Blake and Turturro do perform some wonderfully ludicrous dance moves.<br />There's so much here that's just plain energetic and ridiculous, you're bound to fall in love with it.
B00005B36H|5.0|I would have to say that this album is one of their more moving feats.  For all of us who see Tool as a Spiritual retreat &quot;Rock On&quot;<br />Oh and by the way the point of this review was to show Amazon that this is their 4th album not 3rd.  You guys forgot the begining Opiate.
630398021X|4.0|This film is on my top twenty list of 'The Best Underrated Films Ever'.<br />What makes this film so good is it mixes film noir, action, mystery, and dark comedy together effectively. Most films that try juggling this many balls fail, but this one scores.<br />Also, the film never tries to be over the top. Most futuristic films get so caught up in the technology that they forget about character development. However, this films mixes social commentary with the tech stuff, keeping the film grounded.<br />Now for the acting - both Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett really nail their roles. In fact, all the actors in the film make their characters very believable
0072373350|5.0|This excellent book is full of examples and equations to help students relate to the fundamental concepts in an introductory aerodynamics class. <br />The book is especially useful for reference, as it explains the derivations and many forms of complex equations such as the continuity equation. Furthermore, there are lots of examples of real-world design situations and historical backgrounds.<br />Overall, one of the best books I have used in my undergraduate aerospace engineering curriculum.
B000000OSW|5.0|If you don't own this album then you are a fool.  This is one of the greatest collections of music ever created.  Stop what you are doing right now and buy this album.  You won't be sorry.
B00001OH7T|3.0|For those of you that are hard-core Bowie fans, skip this review.  This is mostly for people who are somewhat unfamiliar with his work.  Mr. Bowie is by far one of my favorite musicians, partly because he is unafraid of experimenting with new styles of music and with new instrumental flares, but this album crosses that line. I want to like it, really I do, and maybe one day it will grow on me, but at least with the first few tries, I'd much rather stick with some Marvin Gaye or some such artist.  This album is top-heavy with saxophone, gospel-ish backing vocals and Bowie really trying to sound soulful. There are a couple of decent tracks on this album, one obviously being Fame and the other, oddly enough, would be the cover of the Beatles' song Across the Universe.  If you're new to his work, I would highly recommend getting a different album, such as the infamous Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, Man Who Sold The World or Hunky Dory.  Of course, this is 100% opinion but if you're anything like me and prefer traditional instruments to synthesizers and drum machines, or like plain old rock 'n' roll, this isn't the album for you.
B000001FS6|5.0|This is a great album that manages to show off all of U2's emmense talents.  The live recordings of Bullet the Blue Sky and All Along the Watchtower rule.  When Love Comes to Town with B.B. King is a great blues track.  And the album has one of my favorite U2 songs- Angel of Harlem.  Sure, if you own one U2 album I would probably say the Joshua Tree but this one is close behind.  So like I said, but this now!
0060392886|5.0|I have 3 things to say: 1) Behind the Music is just a mere glimpse at what you get out of the book; 2)I am an even bigger fan (if that's even possible) after reading it; and 3) this book is a must have for anyone; it will absolutely, without a doubt knock your socks off!<br />Peace and Love
B000002C25|4.0|Listen to this album and get all you can of decent music from these guys.  Their subsequent recordings have all been subpar and their recent live album was a travesty.  There are three super tracks on this disc- #1, #8, and #10- and the others blend in seemlessly.  Give this one a good listen and remember when Oasis could have been the next big thing.
0425104052|5.0|It's not easy to come across a detective story that is nearly flawless, i.e., the criminal's plan isn't too contrived, the motives are clear, the threads the detective follows to solve the case are not too weak, etc.<br />Watson was sent to guard the potential victim, Sir Henry Baskerville, without Holmes' company. His absence further underlined the charm of Holmes as the readers would inevitably be constantly and eagerly hoping for his reappearance. Indeed I was overjoyed when Holmes later re-entered the scene. And the dramatic way he appeared again made his savior image all the sharper and stronger.<br />I think the story would definitely make a truly scary, exciting movie, with all the mysterious setting and dramatic moments. I have not seen the movie yet, but I am now trying to get hold of a copy of the tape.
0316777722|2.0|David had a brilliantly funny one with Naked, I laughed, I loved.  But  I was disappointed with Me Talk Pretty One Day, the reviews hyped it up to be this extraordinary passage of life abroad, but it took forever to get abroad.  It was not as funny as Naked and I expected way too much.
B000000OEI|5.0|This soundtrack could easily rank as one of the best Hans Zimmer has ever done, and certainly one of the best still available on the market today by any composer.  Music will do far more for the drama of a movie than any actor could dream of doing and Zimmer has mastered this technique in Crimsom Tide.  Success breeds success so the fact that many of the musical concepts created in Crimsom Tide show up in later soundtracks isn't surprising.  If you like the soundtracks to The Peacemaker, Gladiator or the Rock, you'll love Crimsom Tide.
B00003CXP1|5.0|It doesn't matter if you like the subject matter or not.  This is a film to view for great camera work, and musical score.  The story line is just the icing on the cake.  It will be one of the movies that people will talk about for years.  Haunting and yet refreshing.  Contrary to what the first review of this movie.  I recomend seeing it as many times as possible.  So don't rent it buy it!!  And show it to all your friends
0385501560|5.0|Strolling through the bookstore, broke, unemployed, I cracked open this book and after reading the first few paragraphs I knew I had to buy it.  Max out that credit card. Who cares?  Here's the author begging us NOT to love his hero.  Here's a guy who isn't a master spy or a noble lawyer, doctor, soldier...  Palahniuk creates a character who lives such an absurd life, but from the way he tells it could be the guy sitting next to you on the bus. These obsurdities are told in such hillarious detail that I couldn't help but laugh out loud and draw stares from the Starbucks crowd.  (I'd look up daring them to ask me what was so funny.)  Chuck Palahniuk draws the lines between the underground/urban folklore life and that of the &quot;normal&quot; people and how it's hard to tell if one is any better off than the other.  All of this in a novel overflowing with useful/dangerous information/misinformation and suprising story revelations that speaks, in a demented way, to young adults who are not satisfied with the goals we are taught to accept.

0807282375|1.0|It's a disturbing series of books, very well written but more is the pity. In Macbeth, the witches chant, &quot;Fair is foul&quot;. Bill Pullman writes toward the same dark purpose.
B000001IQH|4.0|This is a good album, but not as good as Rancid could've made.  They sound great here-raspy vocals courtesy of Lars and Tim, bouncing bass line, fast guitars, and killer hooks.  My favorite songs are Old Friend, Journey..., Maxwell Murder, and lots of others. But some of the songs just don't work.  Why they would put songs like &quot;She's Automatic&quot; and &quot;Junkie Man&quot; with their annoyingly repititive choruses in with the gems is beyond me.  Ah well - they're punks, they can't help it...
0375416811|5.0|I loved this book from the moment I opened the cover.  Bridget is so funny.  She keeps you laughing and interested the whole year.  I especially liked her mother!  I can't wait to read the next book Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I just finished watching this DVD and it's simply breath taking. This was the first time I had watched this film and I enjoyed it a lot.  Lawrence is a very interesting character and I believe that this type of epic film did him justice.  The cast was magnificent.  Peter O'Toole was T.E. Lawrence and there was no question that he took the role very seriously.  The film was photographed beautifully.  The desert landscapes are unlike any others I've ever seen.  This DVD gives you some great extras including a wonderful &quot;Making Of&quot; documentary that covers all the aspects of the production up to the opening.  What I found most interesting is the short interview with Steven Spielberg about the film.  This is obviously one of Spielberg's favorite films and it's really cool to see him gush over something he loves so much.  I would like to see more directors on other DVDs explaining the films impact on them.
0767824571|5.0|\\"The Grail\\" is episodic, silly, and thoroughly fun.  Much like their \\"Life of Brian\\", this film lampoons not only the source material, but the people of time as well.  No one escapes unscathed, and fans of Monty Python will giggle all the way through.
B000059Z8J|5.0|I was skeptical when I sat down to watch this movie again because I didn't know if it would be as good as I had remembered it from the last time I had seen it when I was a kid.  Luckily, it was all that and more.  This time around I was able to appreciate how well Donner balanced a love story with comedy, action, and camp to maintain the dignity of the story of Superman.  Reeve plays Clark Kent/Superman with such skill, you can tell he put a lot of thought into how he would tackle such a beloved character.  The special effects were ahead of their time and some of them still stunned me today.  This DVD is a great presentation of this excellent movie.  The commentary is insightful and gives you all the inside dirt on the production and how bad and long it really was.  The three documentaries on here are awesome too.  They show you the production step by step from casting to editing, and focus on the special effects.  This disc should be enjoyed by everyone, if you're never seen the movie or are catching up on old times.
B000001FZK|5.0|A wonderful listening experience; it proves that Talk Talk was a highly versitile band. A great change of pace from some of their earlier stuff but well worth a listen.
0792839234|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen.  Phantasm has a great cast of people, great special effects for a low budget movie, excellent plot, and one of the greatest twist endings.
0786915749|4.0|I first read the Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy when I was about 14 or 15 years old and I really enjoyed it for the exciting adventures and for the battle scenes.  I'm now 23 and I just finished reading it again for the second time.  All I can say is that I loved it even more this time around, mainly for the superb character development.  Chronicles succeeds on so many levels because Weis and Hickman take you deep into the main character's psyches.  Thus, although the story is epic and sweeping in its scope (good vs. evil with the fate of the world in the balance), it is also imbued with a deeply human and personal quality which makes you (or at least made me) laugh at, get angry at, cry with, and sympathize with the main the characters.  You walk away from this series really feeling that, whether you like them or dislike them in the end, you actually know the characters.        Personally, I was furious at Tanis during the last part of Dragons of Winter Night and almost all of Dragons of Spring Dawning, but in the end you really see that Tanis is a man with flaws like us all.  In the process of reading, I would have preferred that he forget Kitiara and give himself to return Laurana's love way back at the begining of Drag. of Winter Night, but he had to have a wrestle with his own demons before he could choose which woman he was going to give his heart to.  At the end of the story, Tanis is a much more real and substantial character for the whole mess in the middle.  I give this example because it is character development such as this (for good or for evil) that elevates the Dragonlance Chronicles far above most fantasy novels, and indeed even above the clichs inherent in its own storyline.      If you want to read one superb and compelling fantasy series, you'd be hard-pressed to find one that is superior to Dragonlance Chronicles (and then read Dragonlance Legends as well, its just as good).  Start, of course, with Drag. of Autumn Twilight, and after that I don't think you'll have any hesitation about reading the second and third volumes.      (One comment concering comparing DL Chronicles to Tolkien:  Let's let Tolkien be what he is- the father and pioneer and architect of the epic fantasy novel, and let's let Weis and Hickman be what they are- those who are masterfully building on the foundation that Tolkien laid.  Personally, I enjoy both Tolkien's writings and those of Weis and Hickman equally as much, but for different reasons.)
078401213X|3.0|The kindest thing I can say for this movie is that I watched it very intently for the nearly hour and a half that it ran.  Sometimes my interest wanes in movies, and I become distracted by other things, or I can be doing something else while watching the movie, and not miss anything.  This time, I didn't want to look away from the screen because I found myself mostly interested in what was going on, though I'm not really sure why that was, since I wasn't that deeply impressed by the movie.<br /> Being the sort of movie this was, I didn't know any of the actors, but I felt that Sean Guletter, who played Max, the main character, did a good job of portraying the paranoia that he was supposed to be feeling as the movie progressed.  There were others, whose names I can't remember, that also did a good job.  The man who portrayed Max's mentor was a good choice, and I felt he gave the movie more of a depth than it might have otherwise had.<br /> The general plot of the movie was that a mathematician was trying to find the numerical code that is embedded into everything in the universe, to solve the great riddle of the universe.  From this, everything else evolves, the Rabbi's who want to use Max to their own ends to decipher the Torah and find the true name of God, and the wall street fatcats who want to crack the stock market.  Intermixed with all this is Max's own hallucinations, caused by the severe headaches he's experienced ever since staring directily into the sun as a child, until he had lost his sight for a while.<br /> I had several problems with the movie; one of which was when Max's mentor told him about computers becoming aware of their own existence as they approached solving the riddle of the universe, and then they would self destruct.  Huh?  To me, that was an assumption beyond the ridiculous, and deeply detracted from any belief in the movie.  Another scene was one in which Max sits looking at a stock report running across his ticker, and is able to predict with 100% accuracy what the stocks will be at.  Another head shaker as far as I was concerned.<br /> Now, I don't mind movies that make you think a little bit at their conclusion, but generally, I like my movies to be like any other ticket I would buy.  You plunk down your money, you might not be sure of all the stops along the way, but when you get to the end of the line, you know where you are.  This movie presents you with an ending, but then right after that, it presents you with another one, not really leaving you knowing where you are.  Personally, I would have preferred if they had stopped with the first one, it made more sense to me that way.  Another thing, the ending was just sort of out there, they could have actually have put it in anywhere up to about a half hour earlier, and not really have lost anything in the story.<br /> I can't highly recommend this movie, but it did hold my interest most of the time, so I would at least recommend you rent it once, just to see for yourself.  I'm glad I saw it the one time, but it's not one I'll ever add to my collection.
B00005B36H|4.0|It seems redundant to rate this; there is no shortage of opinion on this record.  Tool continues to meld their influences--King Crimson, Black Sabbath, and Pink Floyd--into a heady admixture of psychedelic hard rock that pleases everyone it seems.  Since their first record, Tool's dirtly little secret is that they aren't a metal band per se, but an art rock band only six degrees removed from Robert Fripp and Roger Waters. Maynard James Keenan's voice aside, the real star of this record is Adam Jones, who weaves together angular shards of sound into what is one of the most interesting hard rock records in recent memory.
B000000Y2F|5.0|This album is a showcase of Coltrane's and Monk's genius. Because they were both assigned to different labels at the time of this recording, (1957), it was thought that nothing of their partnership had been recorded. But then this album appeared in 1961 and has been acclaimed as among the greatest achievements in each man's career. 3 of the tracks, &quot;Ruby, my dear&quot;, &quot;Trinkle Tinkle&quot; and &quot;Nutty&quot; feature them in a quartet setting, while &quot;Off Minor&quot; and Epistrophy&quot; are alternate recordings of their septet. &quot;Functional&quot; is Monk playing solo, an alternate take of his greatest ever blues solo. The booklet includes a 3 page essay by Ira Gitler and a couple of photos. This is an album that no jazz lover should be without.
B00005067B|2.0|First: The album \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" is one of the best albums of the year 2000. But, even if you are a huge U2 fan, don't buy this box!<br />Off course, it is nicely made. Velvet cover with the golden heart in a suitcase. In the box are the official album CD, then there's a hat with the print \\"U2 2000\\", a zippo lighter with \\"U2 2000\\" and three guitar licks with U2 logo. But nothing is written in the official U2 font (the one from the album). This is why I know for 100% that this box is NOT official. So don't get fooled and spend so much money for something unofficial. Nothing to be proud of as a true fan.
B00003CXFV|1.0|What is this supposed to be about?  I mean, Julia Roberts said that she performed (well, you know what she said) for all those people.  So, did she?  I watched this thing 3 times and I never saw it.  <br />This is a bad movie.  Don't bother.
0060392886|4.0|I've carried this band around with me for most of my life and what a ride it's been. The Dirt is no different.It chews you up and spits you right back out. The crazy thing is you'll be wanting more. As a child of the 80's this was a must read for me but in all honesty this is a must read for any music fan.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Saw the movie last night in LA. Was floored by its originality, intensity, exuberance, and over-the-toppedness -- and the fact that it still all hung together wonderfully. Now have the CD and am amazed by both. Starts out marvelously with Bowie, moves into version of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; that vastly improves on the original (am 36 -- so remember when the original went out). High points of both movie and CD are Kidman's beautiful &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot; and &quot;Le Tango de Roxanne&quot;. The first real movie of the new millennium (the first post-post-modern film?), both incredibly original and unembarrassed by its pastichedness. The CD is the best 15 bucks you'll spend all summer.
0345442989|5.0|Unlike most of the other Star Wars books, this book has a lot more politics in it. Not nearly as much action as the Rogue Squadron or Thrawn books. There is a lot of debates and things like that, so this might not be the best for you. It does have some Episode II spoilers in it so that can be another drawback to it.<BR>Along with the poltics that are in the book, there is a lot of action from the Jedi, Obi Wan and Qui Gon. They fought both on the ground and in space, making the book interesting. It flows well from scene to scene and expecially at the end, where it links up with Episode I and Shadow Hunters. Another good thing is that there are lots of cameos around in it. Jorus C'Boath(From the Thrawn Books)and Governor Tarkin for example. And there is the things between Palpatine and Valorum, and how they interact with each other. Over all, a good read, one that introduces a new view on the pre-movies era of Star Wars.
6303617719|5.0|You will find it here! This is absolutely my favorite Meg Ryan film. I finally bought it after renting it about 10 times. Kevin Kline is also at his best playing an eccentric Frenchman complete with the accent. There is also quite a bit of comedy in this movie. Very cute and upbeat, there's never a dull moment. There's also a special treat at the end of the film...Kevin Kline personally sings the French version of the song &quot;La Mer&quot; as the credits roll! A true love story...every time I watch it I fall in love with Kevin Kline all over again!
B000059PPN|3.0|Do yourself a favor & buy the 7.99 edition, it's letterboxed, good picture & sound, Don't waste your money & pay over (...) bucks for this hilarious-trying to be scary-movie.  If you a lover of bad movies this is a must have.  Not scary @ all (the bat scene was very funny) ok gore effects.  What u have to do is get a bunch of friends over, pop in this dvd & let the laughs begin.  The reason this movie is so funny is the dubbing & dialog.  The little boy is hysterical(\\"mommy bring me back some can-dy!) it's just has to be heard to be believed (\\"damned tombstone\\")The little boy looks like the love child of Angelina Jolie & Ann Jillian, I still think it is a little girl.  Don't believe any reviewer who tells you this movie is scary, it should be listed as a comedy but like I said earlier it's well worth the money if you are a lover of really BAD movies. give this a try it will make you smile.
6305128952|1.0|Movie Summary: A horse and a girl get hit by a truck. The unlikable mother of the girl takes both the injured girl and horse west to be healed by a horse whisperer.<br />My Opinion: I know that this is by no means a guy movie, but hey I really liked The Bridges of Madison County. I held my breath waiting to see if Meryl Streep was going to open the car door and run through the rain back to Clint Eastwood. There is nothing like this in THW. Robert Redford's character is great, but there is no reason what so ever for him to like much less fall in love with the girl's mother. She has no redeeming qualities. I found him falling in love with her completely unbelievable. Besides that, everything happens so slowly that it's painful. I could have read the novel in less time! The kind thing would have been to put down the horse and end the movie at 30 minutes.<br />DVD Quality: Doesn't make any difference.<br />What You Should Do: Don't buy it, or rent it. Watch it on cable if you must, but be warned you'll fall asleep or at least wish you had.
0060392886|5.0|Incredible!!!!!  They are the baddest rockband around!!! PERIOD. You won't be able to  put this book down. A well written book that will have you laughing, crying and frightened, all at the same time. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE!!!!!!
B0000025T6|5.0|I'll try to be brief:  I'm a middling-aged guy who's liked all kinds of music over the years, everything from Beatles to Simon &amp; Garfunkel to Neil Young to Led Zeppelin (Going to California) to Run DMC (some of their stuff, at least) to Cowboy Junkies, and jazz (the older stuff, Armstrong, Ellington etc.), and classical (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven's 7th), even Yanni (that British Airways tune . . .).<br />And I can't think of another album/CD I've listened to more times than Nebraska. In addition to the other good reviews below, I'd only add that they used to judge an album (yeah, we're talking a while back) by among other things its overall coherence, the way all the songs come together, in theme or tone.  Well, this album is that, in spades.  It's a stream of haunting ballads on the acoustic guitar (no accompaniment but the harmonica), all in a similar tone of despair, loss or alienation, and in the first-person, portraying someone down-and-out or trapped or fallen.  Well, that's pretty bleak, but the songs are so powerful and the tunes are way cool, you gotta hear it.  Like for example, the title track, a narrative by a serial killer, &quot;I saw her standing on her front lawn,/ just a-twirling her baton. / Me and her went for a ride, sir,/ and ten innocent people died. . . .  I can't say that I'm sorry,/ for the things we done,/ 'cause at least for a little while, sir,/ me and her, we had us some fun.&quot;  Yeah, really dark, but the song's incredible. I guess you can preview some of the songs here--definitely do!<br />Take a closer look at the album cover--that's what these tunes are like, stark and beautiful.  That's my two cents' worth . . .
B000000OSW|4.0|This is my personal favorite Peter Gabriel release. Every human being can relate to the themes apparent on US: imperfection, failure in life, failure in love, miscommunication. Peter does an amazing job of making each experience on the album not only his, but everyone's.
0385335482|4.0|I am a 20-something shopaholic just like Rebecca Bloomwood...although *maybe* not quite as bad!  This book is so funny, and it makes you feel like there are people in this world who handle their finances worse than you.  I know so many people (myself included) who shop when they're happy, shop when they're sad, shop when they are bored, or just simply have to buy something every day.<br />This book made me take my mind off my own scary credit card debts for a a few hours and simply laugh with someone else's problems.  Now I just need to figure out a way to either make more money myself or cut back - because dating a multi-millionare just doesn't seem to be in MY cards!
B000002G7G|5.0|This is VU's stripped down, more basic affair. And it may also be their best. Lou Reed is becoming more interested in songcraft rather than noise during this period, and the avant-garde leanings, while still present, are less overbearing. an instant classic.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I had to get used to the idea that EXCITER was going to be a &quot;slow&quot; album, but once I had faced that fact I found this CD to be one of the best I have purchased in a long time.  After an initial listen, the second time around revealed the true nature of the songs.  I am now hooked!!!  Love this CD, just give it a chance.
B00005A1PR|4.0|I also listened to the interview with Arie on NPR - thought &quot;Video&quot; was really refreshing.  Having spun through it a number of times now, the song that keeps me hittin' 'replay' is &quot;Ready for Love&quot; - strong writing, music keeps pulling at you like an undertow, builds to a crash.  My favorite lines so far: <br />&quot;Lately I've been thinkin' maybe you're not ready for me Maybe you think I need to learn maturity They say watch what you ask for, 'cuz you might receive...&quot;  <br />The couple of songs where she lists her musical inspirations/ancestors got annoying on multiple plays.  But a gorgeous CD, reminds me of Des'ree's first offering.
B000058B2W|5.0|Exotic Birds and Fruit was Procol's best album in their &quot;later period&quot; of albums 7-10.  One must go back to the 5th album, the often wished for &quot;Broken Barricades&quot;, to find a work of equal quality.  Some of the tunes on EB&amp;F are simply as good as anything the band ever created--e.g. Strong As Sampson, Thin End of the Wedge, Nothing But The Truth, New Lamps for Old.  NOT Butterfly Boys tho'!<br />Now I'm an old Procol Harumite.  I started listening to them and buying each record as it came out back in 1968, with Shine On Brightly.  I used to debate with myself as to whether Procol was the best Rock and Roll band in the Universe, or whether the best was The Beatles.  But really that wasn't a fair question, because it was comparing apples with exotic fruit.  Both bands in their own ways molded my consciousness in ways probably impossible to explain, but Procol Harum was something special, something God-given for me.  Their worst was better than most bands' best, but when they were at THEIR best no one could touch them except the Beatles.
B000003BES|4.0|if you only want the hits get this or hot rocks ...but if you want more get this one and pretty much everything else...i mean its the stones...heart of stone, get off my cloud,satisfaction, are all great songs. i gave this 4 stars b/c i like the later stuff alittle better
014028009X|4.0|This is a book that speaks to us all. Anyone can empathize with someone like Bridget. I laughed my way from cover to cover...relating to many of Bridget's mishaps and woes! A great and easy read. Highly recommended!
B000021XR5|5.0|Although PURPLE's bright spots do burn brighter, this is a better record overall.  It's just a shame that No.4 wasn't more successful - but I guess that falls on Weiland's shoulders, seeing how his addictions/legal problems prevented the band from giving this effort the support it deserved.  Regardless, this record will age well and hopefully will be looked back upon as their best - up to this point.
B000002LPD|5.0|When I first bought this album, I was expecting more of the same of the best rock band ever, Van Halen. But then something happened, I heard Judgment Day and suddenly it became so much more. Which I didn't think was possible at the time, but once I heard Eddie's guitar solo, it suddenly became possible. Everyone sounded great on this song.<br />As for the rest of the album: Poundcake was awesome and held one of Van Halen's best videos of all time. Spanked was Michael Anthony at his bassing best. Runaround was really cool. Pleasure Dome is probably one of the best songs Alex Van Halen ever performed on. Sammy Hagar kicked on In N' Out, Man On A Mission and The Dream Is Over. Right Now...WOW! 316 and Top of the World tops off this album making it the best ever.<br />Note to Van Halen: You are the greatest band on earth. Keep on rockin'!
B00000I8BX|5.0|This has to be the best Fear Factory album ever; actually, it's my all time favorite.  Songs like Edgecrusher, Smasher/Devourer, and Shock just show you how awesome they still are.  Yeah, Bell's clean lyrics might upset other people but just ignore them.  They are only brief and to the poin anyway.  But what I noticed about this album is that Bell is really screming, unlike their past albums, it sounds like he's more like trying to make his screams sound deeper.  And the guitar, bass, and drums tabs are exellent as they have been since Soul of a New Machine.
B000059ZLH|5.0|The die-hard Dream Theater fan knows that the ultimate would have been to attend the famous Roseland show.  After reading the reviews and seeing the set list we could only imagine what it must have been like to have been there.  Well, imagine no longer.  This release puts you there, in the Roseland Ballroom on August 30, 2000.  Often a live performance cannot capture the vital force of a show and translate it to the screen.  What we've here is a magical conveyance of what really went down that evening.  (Proof positive: Transition from Regression to the 1928 Overture.  The place absolutely detonates).  The band is extremely unyielding in their deliverance of the Metropolis Part 2 set.  It is incredible to watch (and hear) the story from beginning to end.  <br />The extras that are found on the DVD prove that the band left nothing in the tank that night.  (After 3+ hours, A Change of Seasons!)  Further, being afforded the opportunity to mingle outside the venue before the show with the fans, getting to witness the set up for this phenomenal presentation and getting off-stage during the show is pure luxury.  <br />For the music purist, this reveals just what Dream Theater is all about.  Whatever your preference, keyboards/guitar/bass/percussion, this is an extraordinary assemblage of great musicians.   If you are a Dream Theater fan, you cannot be without this enchanted evening of music and power.  If you are a music traditionalist, indulge yourself with this astonishing performance.  Having been nurtured by the likes of (Tales) Yes, (The Lamb) Genesis, (2112/Hemispheres) Rush, UK, ELP, Kansas, Marillion, The Dregs and Pink Floyd, I will tell you this band is full on.  The disintegrating force, the majestic ascensions and the complex changes are absolutely inspiring.  <br />Cost of a DVD player - $200.00.  Cost of the Metropolis 2000: Scenes from New York - $20.00.  Attending the Roseland show over and over, priceless.
B00004WF68|5.0|This record is quite psychadelic, so if you like sixties music, you will definatly like this Traffic album... Some of the best songs would be....Heaven is in your mind, Dear mister fantasy, Dealer, and House for everyone.  Anyways, I certainly like Steve Winwoods voice and Dave Mason's songwriting ability.....see for your self
6304493681|5.0|This is truely a spectacular anime. The animation is amazing and the plot is excellient. In most anime, the plot is basically the same thing. It's either, a futeristic kind of thing with &quot;robots&quot; or there's the karate kind like Street Fighter and DBZ. Or, there's the magic kind of anime such as X and Rayearth. Ghost in the Shell is  original as you can get. You can tell that someone sat on their butt's for a very LONG time, coming up with the plot. You have to be a VERY critical person to dislike this movie. It's the Titanic of anime, except there's not as much romance. Or better yet,it's the Matrix of anime.
B000059T1E|5.0|I would have to say that this is one of my favorite Traffic albums.  Steve Winwood's vocals are amazing!!  This was one of Traffic's best selling albums and it is clear why.  The mix of jazz and rock that Traffic produces is wonderful!  If you do not own any Traffic, this is a good album to start with!
0789723107|5.0|Don't make me think did make me think, but that's a good thing.<br />I've read a number of books on web design, usability etc. Steve's book is one of the most readable and useful treatments of the subject. The book is relatively short and to the point. His approach of mixing in humor and keeping things light make it enjoyable to digest what could be fairly dry information.<br />The sections on testing for usability alone are more than worth the price of the book.  I've already made changes to my own site...based on Steve's book, and I don't take lightly to making changes.<br />If you work in web site design (artist, programmer, designer) or just own your own site -- get the book!
0805062971|3.0|Where to begin? Style, I suppose. Palahnuik writes in a very abrupt and raw manner. There is a general feeling of despair in the novel and rebellion against society. The two characters are existential anti-heroes; they freely act and take responsibility for their actions in a world that is ultimately meaningless. Tyler Durden (the \\"leader) is the character that says most of the interesting lines. Just to define terms; I refer to existentialism in the tradition of Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) and Albert Camus (1913-1960). I refer to nihilism in the sense of the belief that destruction of existing political or social institutions is necessary for future improvement. There is, perhaps, an element of Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche&#8217;s (1844-1900) philosophy as well.<br />Tyler starts two organizations in the novel (Fight Club and Project Mayhem) and I think the succession of the organizations mirrors the philosophical evolution in the novel. Fight Club is existenialist while Project Mayhem is nihilistic. \\"Fight Club,\\" is a gathering (it started in the basement of a bar) where men meet and fight each other. Afterwards, the narrator describes how he feels:<br />\\"After a night in fight club, everything in the real world gets the volume turned down. Nothing can piss you off. Your word is law, and if other people break the law or question you, even that doesn't piss you off.\\" (page 49)<br />It seems as though the man who was lost in materialism is now reenergized through fighting; he is living in the existential \\"now\\" and nothing else matters. <br />Later in the novel, Tyler realizes that the Fight Club members are becoming desensitized to hand-to-hand violence. To increase the &#8220;dosage,&#8221; Tyler invents what he calls \\"Project Mayhem.\\" This is probably best described as a cross between a terrorist group and a cult. At this point, everything starts to spin out of control... Project Mayhem and Fight Club are now beyond Tyler's control and the major revelation comes...<br />Tyler and the narrator are actually the same person. Tyler is the narrator's alter ego but I think Palahniuk keeps this well hidden (although there are occasional hints).<br />Some of the more thoughtful/jarring/vulgar quotes in the book may serve to give a snapshot of the novel.<br />\\" 'I embrace my own festering diseased corruption,' Marla tells the cherry on the end of the cigarette. Marla twists the cigarette into the soft white belly of her arm. 'Burn, witch, burn.'\\" (page 65)<br />\\"Only after disaster can we be resurrected. 'It's only after you've lost everything,' Tyler says, 'that you're free to do anything.'\\" (page 70)<br />\\"'I&#8217;m breaking my attachment to physical power and possession,' Tyler whispered, 'because only through destroying myself can     I discover the greater power of my spirit.'\\" (page 110)<br />\\"I wanted to burn the Louvre. I'd do the Elgin marbles with a sledge-hammer and wipe my (butt) with the Mona Lisa. This is my world, now.\\" (page 124)<br />\\"We are God's middle children, according to Tyler Durden, with no special place in history and ho special attention. Unless we get God's attention, we have no hope of damnation or redemption.\\" (page 141)<br />\\"The mechanic says, 'Believe in me and you shall die, forever.\\" (page 145)<br />\\"I look at God behine his desk, taking notes on a pad, but God's got this all wrong. We are not special. We are not crap or trash, either. We just are, and what happens just happens. And God says, 'No, that's not right.' Yeah. Well. Whatever. You can't teach God anything.\\" (page 207)<br />I think theses quotes give a good picture of what existentialism/nihilism do to one and one's worldview (The overall perspective from which one sees and interprets the world). If you want to read existentialist works, there are better pieces than this: Sartre and Camus are better than this. However, existentialism is fatally flawed and does not work as a philosophy.<br />Finally, in view of Philippians 4:8 (Finally, brethren, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy - meditate on these things.\\" NKJV), I would not recommend Fight Club.<br />Finally, to briefly compare it with the film, I'm not sure which was better. The ending in the novel was better, in my opinion. Also, I don't think the director was capable of properly handling the ideas of the book and it seems he turned the film into a violent, weird and deranged piece that was pointless. Not to say the book is not all these things; but the book was more than that.
B000002IWH|5.0|Although movies today are released with many songs on the soundtrack, they are there mainly to sell the soundtrack before the movie is released to DVD/video so that more money is made by the producers. Very rarely are they there to enrich the film, and even less rare is a soundtrack that perfectly captures the essence of the mood of the movie. Quite frankly, this movie raised the bar so high in both regards that I don't think it can ever be surpassed. It's truly incredible! I've listened to this CD dozens of times and I never tire of it. From the ultra-cool &quot;Golgotha Tenement Blues&quot; to Nine Inch Nails' wicked &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, Rollins Band's brutal &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, and Jesus and Mary Chain's rockin' &quot;Snakedriver&quot;, everything about this album is an alt-rock fans dream come true. If you like your music with loud guitars and screamingly intense vocals, yet with creativity and focus, you cannot go wrong with this album. I'm not going overboard when I say it's absolutley brilliant. What a shame it sells a lot less than most of the mainstream garbage that is released these days, and simply because it's considered too edgy and aggressive.
B00004XONN|4.0|These reviews read like an angry internet forum, which is not good. While I wholeheartedly believe that forums=waste of time, I've decided to post on this review forum nonetheless.<br />So what do I have to say about Kid A?  I don't like it as much as OK Computer, but that's just my opinion.  The reason for my four stars, instead of five, is that there are simply some songs on this album I don't like, even though I've listened to them several times. I don't personally like the songs Kid A, Everything in its right place, and Idioteque, and others, like National Anthem and Morning Bell, are just okay. The remaining songs, especially In Limbo, How to Disappear Completely, and Motion Picture Soundtrack are absolutely stunning, beautiful songs.<br />And what do I think about the originality of this album? They most likely are borrowing ideas and methods from electronic music pioneers, but that's not exactly a bad thing, and certainly doesn't make them &quot;Derivative&quot;. At the core of this album are their songs, their lyrics, their melodies, despite the fact that some garage techno or indie artist did this or that before Radiohead got there. It doesn't matter, and honestly, such comparisons do no justice either to Radiohead or Bjork, or Aphex Twin, etc.; they are all musicians, and whether or not there is some borrowing of ideas doesn't really matter. They're musicians, and this is their music. End of argument.<br />So what's left after tearing Kid A apart, looking for who influenced it? The important things:  Beautiful, soulful, dreamlike songs from a wonderful band that continues to reinvent itself. I wish every band was this &quot;Derivative&quot;.
B0000542DH|3.0|Media vs. murderers.  Who is the demon and who is the angel?  Well, Oliver Stone makes the case that there is that fine line and sometimes we step over that line into that other side.  The real demons in our world are portrayed in a kind of super-hero fashion.  The more evil, the more you want to be closer to the action.  So, what Stone does here works very well, and it paints a vivid and unholy picture of human nature in general.  Watching this movie leaves you with a numb feeling - and I would guess that's the way Stone wants it.
B00004XONN|5.0|Well, I wouldn't be a music fan &amp; wannabe critic if I didn't weigh in on the controversial Kid A. I happen to really like this album, and I have to admit that I don't understand what all the furor is about. To my ears, this is neither a horribly cacophonous middle finger to Radiohead fans everywhere, nor is it a staggering breakthrough of artistic genius.  It's just a cool, somewhat experimental album with its own vision, some great sounds, somber and sometimes beautiful emotional landscapes, and great MELODIES, believe it or not! But if you've heard anything as adenturous as, oh, Pink Floyd or early Peter Gabriel, this shouldn't strike you as that outlandish. Another suggestion to the potential buyer: Kid A keeps getting described as electronica, but this is not a particularly synth-y, drum machine driven record; it has a much more lush and organic feel than what is usually described as electronica. If that sounds good to you, give it a try!
0425152251|5.0|I knew about this book through an e-mail, and suddenly felt the urgency to read it. When I found it, I was very happy, even when I thought it was a little long. It was very interesting to read about the different philosophical movements developed through the time. I have to admit it, there were moments of despair, because beyond reading a book, I fel tlike sutdying for a Philosophy test.<br />The book starts with a big question, a question we all would have to answer with great sincerity at some moment in our lives: Who am I? But suddenly we find ourselves very involved with philosophy matters, and then we forget about the question.<br />I think this is a book to read not once, but twice, and maybe more times, but we have to do it without hurry. It will be probably during the second reading we could take more advantage of the book, because we already will know which the end is, what it is about, and then we will stop trying to imagine what the end would be.<br />For me, it was very fascinating to find somewhere in the book, a very special relation father-daughter, which I think it is the most important point in this story, embellished with a lot of philosophy information. Now that I prepare for my second reading, I am thinking again: Who am I?
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is a masterpiece. I won't go on and on about it, because almost 500 people have already done that, but I will say this: If you like Tool, check out King Crimson's big three metal albums from the 70s -- &quot;Lark's Tongues in Aspic,&quot; &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; and &quot;Red.&quot;<br />Rock on.
B000002JSH|4.0|THis is true hard rock at his simplest, harder, tougher version. THis CD is very, very good, but in an album featuring only 8 songs, two of them ( ANNA and &quot;WEEP NO MORE&quot;) are too cheesy for my taste.
1878424432|5.0|Since I've read this book, at least two dozens of my best friends got it as a gift. They ALL thanked me a lot! Read it and I am sure you'll do the same. For some, the beginning might be a little foggy (&quot;what the hell is he talking about here?&quot; type of thing.) But do NOT be discouraged. If you really find Chapter one a little bit weird, go to Chapter two. It will hit you then. Then, after reading through 2-5, go back to the beginning.<br />This, I say, is a book that can really help us, in a so simple, yet powerful way, to create better lives, to have a better place to live in.<br />Do yourselves a favor. Do your kids a favor. Get the book and read it once every three months.<br />Let me know how it was!
0345442989|5.0|Cloak of Deception is not only an exciting read, but it also nicely sets the stage for the events of TPM.<br />Most importantly for Star Wars fans, this book explains what the vague &quot;dispute over taxation&quot; at the beginning of Episode I is all about. Much of the information to be found here would have improved the film as well, by more fully explaining the motivations of key characters and more sharply setting the tension. For instance, the fact that the dispute isn't really about taxes, but rather about (a) a nascent rebellion, (b) the reactions of both the Trade Federation and the Republic to growing anarchy and (c) political control over large portions of the galaxy is important to understanding the issues behind TPM.  Of course, Palpatine's behind-the-scenes manipulation of everyone on every side is also interesting and illuminating. As a side note, I think that in TPM Lucas wanted to hide Palpatine's actions behind a veil of secrecy and mystery, a goal that was largely successful. On the other hand, Lucas was so successful that the film left us clueless as to what the political factions were debating and why the Trade Federation was making such a hostile play for Naboo. TPM as a stand alone film would have been better served if Lucas had cleaned up those plot lines a bit  - even one or two lines explaining the dilema would have helped (it's all about motivation!). Cloak of Deception corrects that oversight.<br />Perhaps just as important to the future development of the SW epic is Luceno's treatment of the rift among the Jedi regarding the nature of the Force. Luceno tell us that some (Qui-Gonn Jinn among them) adhere to the precepts of the &quot;Living Force,&quot; while others (the majority of the Jedi Council) follow those of the &quot;Unifying Force.&quot; In the interest of brevity and my unwillingness to spoil an interesting plot line for fans, suffice it to say that this book begins to explain why Qui-Gonn is somewhat of an outsider (his adherence to the Living Force) and how these conceputal differences have somewhat divided the council. I think that this philosophical difference will also tie in with the midi-chlorian thingies and the disappearing Jedi conundrum (SW fans understand those references).<br />I'm not even going to outline the plot in this review - it's mostly standard dueling, space chases and other swashbuckling. As far as all of that goes, Luceno does a fine job balancing action, political intrigue and character development.<br />Footnote: I think that reading this book will probably be as essential as watching TPM again before Episode II hits the screens. The political intrigue is bound to play a role in the next film, too.
B00005A3KS|1.0|I'm a Point Break fan. It's one of the best &quot;bad&quot; movies out there, so I was pumped when it finally came out on DVD. Unfortunately, it is a total ..... Everyone loves to watch their favorite movies in letterbox, because it gives you the opportunity to view the full movie as opposed to the scan made to fit the VHS format. In the case of Point Break however the letterbox format was achieved by cropping the top and bottom off of the vhs scan. So, not only do you not get the full feature film, you don't even get the VHS view of the film. It's claustrophobic. There are scenes in this DVD that don't even makes sense, parts of people's faces are cut off. DO NOT BUY THIS [junk]!!! The picture is sharp, but it's like watching the movie through a keyhole!!!
B000002AZX|5.0|Though it's not as strong as the subsequent two albums of his &quot;comeback&quot;-I'm Your Man and The Future-Various Positions is a strong and poignant album. Some of Cohen's most sentimental and thoughtful lyrics persist here. From the &quot;love conquers all&quot; mysticism of Dance Me To The End of Love to the religious ambivalence of Hallelujah (which contains the nominal verse &quot;You say I used the name in vain/But I don't even know the name/But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?/There's a blaze of light in every word/It doesn't matter which one you heard/The holy or the broken hallejulah&quot;), to the poignant, touching war story The Captain, Cohen is a lyrical genius here. This album is also notable because it is the last one where Cohen has complete control over his voice. Indeed, since it also manages to do without the keyboards and such that would come to dominate the textures of his next two album (particularly I'm Your Man) you could call this the last of Leonard Cohen's folk-styled albums. A must for any fan of his.
B00005JIZA|5.0|So many albums are lacking something.  This one is not.  It completes itself with exactly the songs you want to hear from this 23 year old you've never heard of.  Listening to it for the first time is like hearing an album you wish you'd always owned.  Mayer sounds a little like Sting, but with more familiarity and a little like Vertical Horizon with less production.  He combines just the right instrumentation and just the right vocals every time.  <br />&quot;Neon&quot; is my favorite track.  The title describes how &quot;she buzzes.&quot;  The rest of the songs are equally vivid.  You get the feeling that Mayer has been writing for many more years than he has.  The album takes you up and down more times than I thought possible with only 12 tracks.<br />Buy it.  You won't regret it.
B00004SCX6|3.0|maybe i'm too hursh but i would think twice wether or not buying this c.d if i listened to it first! o.k, so i bought this c.d a really long time ago, when oops i did it again was still being played, and i liked the song. probably that's why i bought it...  so the album does has it's good side, and here's  some reviwes about some tracks:<br />don't go knockin' my door- ammm... a nice one... but takes a few listenin' to it before you actually sing it in your head!<br />satisfaction- blaahhh... what a waste of time!!! b-o-r-i-n-g!!!<br />what u see- now here's a good one!!! i really like this!!! it should have been a single instead of the cheesy, whiny &quot;don't let me be the last to know...&quot; <br />can't make u love me- also a very nice one! the meaning supposed to be kinda sad, but the beat is fast, and it sounds very good! i like it...<br />girl in the mirror- that's i think is a bonus track right? anyway, it is a very beautiful ballad, i love it.<br />so if you're one of spear's fans, or you like pop songs, buy this c.d.  if not... well.... think twice!!!!!
6300184064|5.0|From the first viewing of this motion picture, I was HAUNTED. Like many other folks, I read all those books like &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, and &quot;1984&quot;.  As disturbing as they were for the impressionable teenager who read them, this movie was and still is troubling for that teenager-now-adult.  No-one but Terry Gilliam could have taken a story as complex as this and communicated it as clearly as this while leaving the complexity intact.  DeNiro is superb in a minor part that serves to shape the whole story, and Jonathan Pryce IS everyman ...
0792844882|1.0|I remember whan I saw this one- Upon it's video release.  Blockbuster was practically giving it away with every purchase, and still couldn't get rid of it.  I watched it twice in a row.  The first time, I don't think I could pry my jaw off the floor.  When we are first introduced to \\"innocent\\" Nomi Malone, she is hitchhiking (in a Daisy Mae outfit and full cocktails-at-5 makeup) into a new life in Las Vegas.  The Elvis looking guy who picks her up manages to steal all of of her stuff.  When the character who will end up being her best friend(!) tries to help,  Nomi screams, pouts, acts like a 60's era Ann-Margret having a seizure, pukes in the friend's Honda, and runs headlong into traffic.  Rather than letting her get killed and out of her life, future friend plunges into traffic and saves her (But the guy in the Cadillac seems to have met Nomi or something; when he sees her he speeds up).  This level of absurdity almost never lets up.  We are asked to believe that Nomi becomes one of Vegas' biggest showgirls when her terpsichorial skills alternate between the aforementioned spasms, a baby hippo stomping out a grease fire, and a lot of twisting around poles.  We are asked to believe that men find her incredibly erotic, when her sexual performace seems more like an epileptic with really bad constipation.  We are asked to believe that she is constantly snarfing down double-doubles, yet she weighs 8 lbs (6 of it chest).  We are asked to believe that anybody, even in Vegas, would put up with this dim-witted, badly permed, overly painted shrew for more than a minute and a half.  And incredibly, screamingly, this is NOT played for laughs.  The Rambo-esque scene when she prepares for the revenge she will have upon the man who brutally rapes (not a funny scene, and shot in an icky, really leering fashion) is beyond laugh out loud.  Instead of strapping on the ammo, she does her nails.  Yep.  She paints designs on her Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Press-ons to the same sort of musicusually reserved for Schwartzenegger preparing to avenge the partners death, so that she can go seduce, then kick the teeth out of, the bad guy.  She then is forced to give up her career, since she commited a cardinal Vegas sin: beating up somebody famous over a nobody.  And we are asked to think \\"how this woman has GROWN\\"  In our last Nomi sighting she is hitchhiking out of Las Vegas (wearing- if possible- even MORE make-up) and is picked up by.. Oh just guess.. yep, the same guy who ripped her off!  Absolutely  a howler- I can't rate it more than one star in case of the unsuspecting, but this movie is a five star, \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" kind of \\"what were they thinking\\" laugh a minute riot.
B00005ASQ1|3.0|Think &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; in the Bronx.<br />The tried and true &quot;teacher-student relationship in which the teacher learns as much, if not more than the student&quot; resurfaces in this film, although Gus Van Sant gives it a new spin.  This time, the &quot;teacher&quot; is a misanthropic former wonder boy author, and the student is an inner city basketball player with an incredible talent for writing.<br />Sean Connery and Rob Brown are very good as William Forrester and Jamal Wallace.  The role of Forrester allows Connery to go beyond his superhero pose, and Connery imbues the character with genuine human qualities.  He examines Forrester's wounds and eccentricities and lays them bare, but he also lets the character's arrogance shine through, exposing just enough to keep Forrester from being merely a crotchety old man.<br />Of course, Forrester also happens to be Scottish, which isn't a huge stretch for Connery, and it allows him to plug his ancestral homeland, of course.  (An ancestral homeland he hasn't lived full-time in for over twenty years...But I digress...)<br />Brown's intense, honest, understated performance is an excellent foil for Connery's occasional grandstanding.  It's not what Brown reveals, it's what he doesn't reveal that makes the performance noteworthy.  You can see the intelligence in Jamal's eyes, a difficult thing for any actor to convey.<br />The problem with &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; is that the film spends so much time developing the two main characters, everything else pretty much goes by the wayside.  The plot is conventional and predictable, and the supporting cast is pretty much forgettable.  Will Hunting's scrappy, sometimes obnoxious group of drinking buddies (Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, and Cole Hauser) were some of the most memorable minor characters in recent film because they were so well developed, but Jamal Wallace's friends and family are barely given enough screentime to have a conversation with him.<br />Other characters fare just as badly.<br />F. Murray Abraham essentially reprises his role as the disgruntled, talentless composer Salieri in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, but this time, he plays a disgruntled writer who takes out his anger and disappointment on his students.  Unfortunately, Abraham is never given the chance to reach the emotional complexity of Salieri, reducing his role to an angry, jealous old has-been.<br />Anna Paquin, one of the finer young actresses of the day, is basically wasted in the thankless role of Jamal's potential love interest, Claire, the upper class white girl.  Paquin is given neither the screen time nor the material to develop Claire into a remotely interesting character.  The film ends before it can delve into &quot;West Side Story&quot; territory.<br />&quot;Finding Forrester&quot; has every intention to be something other than conventional.  Unfortunately, so much time is spent building up the relationship between the two main characters, there isn't enough film left to do anything new, and the final message is nothing that we haven't heard before.

0380788624|5.0|In Short, this book blew me away. How he thought of this I'll never know, but he is clearly more brilliant than I.  I've been told this is a &quot;guy&quot; book, but it also appeals to &quot;chicks&quot; in the Silicon Valley.  This is a must read and goes to the top of any list I recommend to others.
B00004W56S|5.0|Originally released in the U.S. in 1980 by Passport/Jem Records.  Released elsewhere by Charisma/Virgin.  Rumoured to be reissued later this year by Caroline. I found this LP by chance at an indie second-hand bookstore in my neighbourhood.  It was already on my wishlist here.  Good thing I got it then since it may be a while before you can buy it here new on CD. It reminds me of the last two Genesis albums at the time &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot; and &quot;Duke&quot;.  Like &quot;Duke&quot; and Phil Collins-produced &quot;Something's Going On&quot; by Frida (ABBA), this was cut at ABBA's Polar Studios in Stockholm, Svenska (Sweden). Noel McCalla (Manfred Mann's Earth Band) does vocals and original Genesis member Ant Phillips does keyboards. The next LP, &quot;Acting Very Strange&quot;, lives up to that title 'cos Mike sings himself, and he sounds drunk!  The Mechanics repaired his fledgling solo career the next time after that!
B00003CXD0|5.0|Tootsie is a hysterical movie.  Dustin Hoffman gives one of the best performances of his career as a contentious, unemployed actor (Michael Dorsey), who masquerades as a woman (Dorothy Michaels) to land a part on a soap opera.  Tootsie is one of the best comedies ever made.  It is also extremely touching.  Michael Dorsey's gender-bending stint on the soap opera is very cathartic for him.  Michael falls in love with his co-star (Julie Nichols) portrayed by Jessica Lange.  This new found romance awakens a new found sensitivity in Michael Dorsey.  Lange won a well deserved Academy Award for best supporting actress for this role.  Bill Murray, Teri Garr, and Sydney Pollack gave great performances as well.  My only gripe with this DVD is that it was deficient in the bonus features department.  There is no making of Tootsie documentary or director's commentary.  Nevertheless, the quality of the movie alone is worth giving this DVD the highest recommendation possible.
B00003CXRP|5.0|the only thing that the average person may not like about this film is the un-American type of ending.........Hanks puts on a real Oscar performance, the best of his career........the movie grabs you and you emotionally ride the waves with Tom in this great &quot;new&quot; classic that will be on top ten lists years from now.
B00001ZWBQ|2.0|I only buy DTS concert DVDs.  My setup is top of the line. I apparently did not want to believe the reviews which  hammered the DTS recording quality of this concert, but they were right.  The vocals are incredibly muddied, and the center channel seems to be dedicated exclusively to a snare drum.  I basically have to turn my center channel off to hear lyrics, and they still don't sound that great.<br />Compared to the Eagles, Steely Dan, Orbison DTS recordings, this concert sounds [bad].  The video quality is very good, but there's no point in cranking the sound.  If DTS is your thing, you've been warned..AGAIN!
B00003CXP1|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I saw it in the movie theater, it was interesting because after the movie ended everyone in the theater left in complete silence.  Not a word was spoken.  It is disturbing and hard to handle, but a must see production.
B00004Z459|5.0|Every year an album comes out to each genre of music that amazes and stuns people. Such as Disturb's 2000 release known as &quot;Sickness&quot; or Creed's &quot;Human Clay&quot;, but this album is different than that. You can feel the emotion in the song, you can understand where the lyrics are coming from, and after listening to each song, you think &quot;What does this mean?&quot;. You soon figure out each song has a meaning and is great truth to what people do in life. Each song on the album is great! Ranging from the rapcore style of &quot;A Place for My Head&quot; to the odd and insane DJ style on &quot;Cure for the Itch&quot;. If you want to know if you should by this album, I say yes. If you like rock, it's great. If you like rap, it's great.
6305841861|5.0|Worth the price for the commentary alone.  Hearing Bruce Campbell rip on what has arguably become his most famous role will keep you in stitches every time you listen.  Campy, goofy, bloody as all hell, yet way ahead of its time.  The camera work is amazing.  Other reviewers before me have said that it's like the Three Stooges decided to make a horror film.  There is no better description, and no finer compliment.
B0000584V3|3.0|Let me just say that it is great to hear real metal music...again.  I've survived the 80's hair bands, 90's grunge B.S. and am open for something new. I think the musicians in this band are very talented.  I think the refernces to \\"classic\\" are a bit far fetched, but I hear some very well written pieces of music, especially the instrumental portion of \\"Blackwater Park\\", very cool!. I would like to give it more stars for the music alone. <br />But seriously, why the death growls.  Dude, just sing.  There are enough Cannibal Corpes et al!  Being in my 30's, I never got into the death metal scene(came close though!), simply for the annoying growls.  If there was no singing what so-ever, I would probably dig it because most(not all) death bands have decent musicians.  I digress.<br />Anyways, I can't complain too much I guess, at least there is no rapping or sampling ala Nu-Metal  --> Limp, Disturbed etc...!  However, if the singer had a decent voice(at least sang a bit!) I would give this one a better rating.
0380788624|5.0|I usually wait for a book to engross me for around 30 pages, or maybe a hundred, if it is a recommendation... Reading Cryptonomicon caught my interest right after the 4th page. I could not wait to know what happened to both stories (WWII and present).<br />I did not find the book to be too technical. I am a computer scientist, and I think the explanations on the book for the cryptographic issues are some of the clearest I have found anywhere, and that is in part what I really enjoyed. The other enjoyable part is the stretching of current technology to the point where you can't really tell what is real and what is an exaggeration.
0553579908|5.0|How can I say this?  George R.R. Martin is the grand master of fantasy fiction, although there is only three novels so far; which could span more than that of Robert Jordans, The Wheel Of Time; I have never been more captivated in my whole entire lifetime!<BR> Reading this book in just two short days, thats right, its so good! I have been left dumbfounded by how well Martin can write a hefty book such as this, and keep one reading eagerly from page to page, without feeling lost.  Now, just starting the third, &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; I am completely convinced that this series will seriously take over this genre that we call fantasy! I reccomend this to even those who vow to never read fantasy!  You will see the world in a total differen't light!  Read it and ENJOY!!!
0140288503|4.0|Written in breathless prose, this exciting book was a page-turner from the very start.  However, I can only give it 4 stars (bordering on 3.5) because some passages were just too grisly for me.  I've read books about Iwo Jima that weren't as gruesome!  While no one, including me, wants American soldiers doing their duty abroad in Third World Thunderdomes to be killed by ragged natives, you'd also have to be some kind of sociopath not to feel pity for so many of the Somalis (addled old men, women, young kids) who were blown to smithereens in this desperate firefight.  They were, after all, to their way of thinking, defending their neighborhood against men decked out like the Imperial Storm Troopers from Star Wars.  Also, I think Bowden just enjoyed writing all that gory stuff a...little...too...much...
B00005B36H|5.0|I know, lots of you are disapointed about lateralus, but give the cd time it REALLY grows on you. I didn't like it at first, nor did i like it after listening to it 3-4 times but i really started to live this cd after the 5th time or so. Don't just sit down and listen to it, or you'll be bored to death! Listen while doing your homework or something. Sure its more mellow but the emotion. Every song is great. I got hooked on Ticks and Leeches and Schism first, but Schism is actually my least favorite song on the cd (though its still amazing). Best songs are imo 1. Parabola 2.The Patient (listen from 5:20-6:30; wow!) 3. Ticks and Leeches
6300270424|5.0|In the &quot;Editorials&quot; Section, there was a saucer-eyed review by a guy from Pennsylvania.<br />To set this all in context, I saw the Zeppelin fly in concert three times, including Robert Plant's all-time personally rated best performance, the legendary San Francisco/Kezar Stadium appearance in early Summer 1973. For the sake of brevity, I'll have to save those details for another time and forum. Sorry, folks, but it WAS BOSS!!! <br />Anyway, I have a very wide range of musical tastes and have found God just as easily in seeing Herbie Hancock (Jazz) in concert; hearing Django Reinhardt (Jazz, again); listening to Classical French Romantic to Recent Pipe Organ music (both live and recorded); and seeing both Albert King and John Lee Hooker (Blues).<br />I have seen Link Wray, and Black Sabbath (SIX times!!), and those legends do have their own styles, but you can find God just as well, and they're in the SAME genre as the Zepps. Why, on the Sabbs' &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; tour, I saw Tony Iommi do an amazing 20-odd minute free-form solitarty solo in his own right. He looked as if he were in deep meditation during this segment of this performance. The Sabbs must have played close to THREE HOURS, in Oakland in 1992.<br />So I don't dash/disabuse poor Saucer Eyes of his perceptions entirely, I will voice a vast amount agreement with him that &quot;Song . . .&quot; has to be in the top five, if not the top seven rock films of all time.<br />Here's a Robert Plant fantasy that I'd like to see. For those of you who are also fans of Anne Rice's &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot;, I'd always felt Robert was the perfect Vampire Marius, Lestat's patient mentor. I have no idea why Robert isn't appearing in the sequels to &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;. He'd look just dandy with a set of stiletto fangs! And Catherine Zeta-Jones as his paramour, the Vampiress Pandora!
B000002KMY|5.0|There are many words I could use for this cd.  But I will just simply say it's awesome.  This is the first sabbath cd i ever got, and it started my Sabbath frenzy.  Now I know because of that statement, Ozzy die-hards may ridicule and say I don't know real sabbath, but they're wrong.  I have all of black sabbath's cds except for live at last, and this one is very special to me.  In listening to this cd, i personally don't get why reviewers of this keep bashing Ronnie and Vinnie.  I think they're great musicians and performers, I'm willing to bet that the only reason people slag them is because they're Americans.  Now to the CD.  Turn up the night is an awesome starting track, voodoo grooves all the way through, sign of the southern cross is the best track i'd even say it's better than iron man(Uh-Oh, I'm in trouble!)  Mob Rules is the heaviest song on the album, and i love Ronnie's vocals on this, he can scare the [heck]out of any Hanson fan.  Country girl rocks and shows a gentle side, slipping away is kinda odd, but i love all the solos from geezer, tony, and vinnie.  Falling off the edge of the world is an excellent tune that sadly never got included in the live set.  And Over and over is the melancholic track that ends the album with ronnie's sympathy for the dying world of hate and frustration.  I give this 5 stars, i wish i could give more.  Like i said in my review of Eternal Idol, buy this if you have an open mind and you aren't too stubborn to listen to anything that doesn't have Mr. Banshee on it.
0887308589|5.0|Scott Adams has nailed corporate America.  If you have spent any time at all working for a big corporation, you will find this book to be very funny.  The comic strips are always pretty humorous, but what I found also to be very funny was the text in this book, specifically describing the various corporate functions such as engineering, marketing, sales, and of course general management.  As a human resource director, I have often been referred to as &quot;Catbert - the evil HR Director&quot; (in a good way of course), by others who enjoy Adams work.  The way he describes typical business situations, like the ongoing balancing act between engineering products and marketing them, is eerily accurate, and very funny.  Unless you take yourself and your job way too seriously, you will not only enjoy this book but laugh out loud all the way through it. My only critical suggestion would be for Adams to stick to business related humor.  When he strays from that into other social commentary it is not as impactful.  Other than that, this is a great book!
0393038912|1.0|Diamond writes from the perspective of the victor. This compromises the integrity and content. Obvious clues stare him in the face, but he refuses to see them. He admits hunter-gatherer worked less hard to survive than the farming counterparts. He admits humans are included in the category &quot;animal&quot;. But the explanation as to the slow acceptance of farming and civilization are still attributed to a flaw, or problem within the people themselves. The idea these people chose to remain hunter-gatherer over farmer is outside his realm of possibility. This is why he claims there are still many questions unanswered. Inaccurate and ethnocentric.
B000002I27|5.0|<br />October 1967: The Doors' second album is released.<br />The first release by the Doors, their self-titled album that contained the increasingly famous \\"Light my Fire\\" and the increasingly infamous \\"The End\\", had become a bestseller in the few months that passed between the date it was issued and the date the second album, STRANGE DAYS, was first seen in record stores. However, it was a fine distance that existed between the songwriting quality and production on the first release and the quality and production on the second release. The band would never put forth an album like STRANGE DAYS again in their career; filled with ear-catching soundscapes, bizarre melodies, and complex arrangements, not one track on the 35-minute work is a waste of time.<br />The incredible set of songs present here include the piece-du-resistance, another 11-minute masterpiece entitled \\"When the Music's Over\\". While not as gripping as the previous lengthy centerpiece featured on the first work, \\"Music\\" is by far more entertaining, reaching climax after climax and driven by a persistant bassline, bluesy guitar, and the usually interesting Morrison-penned lyrics. Unlike \\"The End\\", I was able to listen to the entire composition without having to look at the timer on my stereo once. The shorter, more concise demonstrations of brilliance featured alongside the aforementioned work include the catchy, incredible \\"Love me Two Times\\", with lyrics by Robbie Kreiger that are forgivable because he's obviously TRYING to emulate classic blues verses. My personal favorite Doors song is the eerie, shimmeringly beautiful \\"You're Lost Little Girl\\", which may be the only tune by the group that features a pretty melody. The memorable \\"Moonlight Drive\\" is arranged here to the nth degree, but that makes the piece even more effective as the designated \\"party\\" song. The two throwaways \\"My Eyes have Seen You\\" and \\"I Can't See Your Face in My Mind\\" are actually better than the more-cabaret-than-Alabama-Song-but-still-more-convincing-mega-hit \\"People Are Strange\\", the latter for being an maddeningly psychedelic, enticing ballad, and the former for being the scariest (and probably most powerful) thing on the entire album. The introductory \\"Strange Days\\" lives up to its title, and is an ominous display of the new studio techniques the Doors would heavily employ throughout the record, and \\"Unhappy Girl\\" is the absolute pinnacle of entertainingly over-produced excercises. (By the way, they're both stellar tracks). Understandably, the worst track is \\"Horse Latitudes\\", but the Residents-esque \\"music\\" behind Jim's poetic readings succeeds in creating a grim effect, and daring, dramatic excursions like this are what made Jim Morrison famous--are they not?<br />All in all, this is by far the best Doors album; it is reccomended you purchase the first record before this, but don't expect to be truly blown away until you put on your headphones to enter the musical carnival of \\"Strange Days\\".
0679879269|5.0|When I first read &quot;The Golden Compass,&quot; the storyline took me away and swept me off my feet-which is more than I can say for a lot of other books. Truly, the trilogy has kept me going, and I recommend it to anyone who has never read it before.<br />&quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; finishes the exciting tale of Lyra and Will and the mysterious Dust particles, but I was by no means satisfied at the end of the novel. I was dying as I neared the end, silently screaming, &quot;Why is he doing this? He can't do this to them!&quot; I was in a fit of rage at Pullman for ending the story the way he did, but that does NOT mean I didn't like it. It doesn't mean it's a bad ending either. It evoked emotion, and when as story does that as well as Pullman has done, you know it's worth reading.
0380778556|5.0|I received this book as a present from my cousin, who said that this was her favorite book when she was my age(14 years old).  Well, I read it, and it easily became my favorite too!!  DuMaurier excellently plotted the book, making me not able to put it down (flashlight reading!! LOL!! Don't tell Mom!)  I recommend this book to EVERYBODY, of all ages!!
B00004XQP4|2.0|Greenday was one of the first punk bands to break into the main streem and has been populat ever since.  I am a hige green day fan but this is thier worst work.  They are toning down thier lyrics thier music is going soft.  Whether this is because they are getting older have families or fame has finaly gotten to them.  The one song that saves this cd from getting one review is the song minority.  This song should become a punk anthem.  Unfortunately this one song cannot carry the whole cd.  The other songs while easy beats to get into do not sound anything like Nimrod or Dookie thier best cd.  If they are switching genres then more power to them but as a punk band they are no longer.  If possibly buy the single don't waste your money on the other stuff on this cd.  Hopefully if they make another cd it will be the old school type that Green Day fans love them for.
B000059TPN|5.0|OK, you all know the movie, it's a better than average action movie, with a great cast. But this disc is out of this world, image is stunning, sound is deafening, and the commentary is worth the price of admission alone as Cage and Harris in particular are fascinating. Once again Criterion come up trumps, this 2 disc set now sits proudly next to Unbearable lightness of Being and Insomnia for perhaps the first time in it's existence!
B00000J631|4.0|This cd is just damn good.  If you don't like the song that is playing then 30 seconds later will be a song you might like.  With 101 songs to listen to you will get to hear from many diffrent bands and perhaps you will like to buy some of those cds.  The only problem with the cd is that being 101 songs long most cd players stop at 99 so it is difficult to fastfoward throgh the last couple of songs not that you would want to!
B00005BCNC|4.0|Anything directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt HAS to be at least good. Well Cast Away is great! Although they spend a little more time on the parts on the island than needed, Cast Away is still an excellent adventure film! FOUR STARS! Directed by Robert Zemeckis - What Lies Beneath, Forrest Gump.
0060278234|5.0|I think that the book Lirael is an excellent book as  is the pre-sequel Sabriel. This book is about a young woman named Lirael who despretly wants to be a proper Clayr which she is not. Lirael becomes a librarian and is sent away to battle evil. On her journey she encounters many obstacles and even something else. Half of this book is also about Sabriel's son Price Sameth and his encounters and adventures. This book is a good book for ages 9+ This was one of my faves.
B000002AT6|5.0|This perhaphs is James Horner's most breathtaking score.  I find the score powerful and moving and it greatly compliments the movie.

0812589041|5.0|I thought Enders Game was a very good and action-oriented book.  The book contains some very good imagery and that helps a lot when you read a novel.  Even though Enders Game is hard to imagine, you can still picture it in the future.  I admire Ender for his leadership and inteligence.  If I was called to battle, there is no one I would rather be than Ender Wiggin.  I think he still would have defeated the buggers if the teachers would have told him the truth before the battle.  I also think Ender was pushed too hard.  He and Dragon army should have had regular battles instead of 2 on 1 matches or two battles a day.  Ultimately Enders Game was a great book.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Words cannot even begin to describe what delights are in store for the hapless comedy fan who has not yet seen Fawlty Towers, but I'll try. Basil Fawlty has become a comedy legend since he and his co-stars first graced our screens in the mid 70's. Yes, it's a vintage series and some of the language may not be very PC in this day and age but the result is still hilarious. Take it as you find it and you will be rewarded. There is not enough space to fully describe what delights are in store, but rest assured, you will be investing in a piece of essential comedy history when you buy this. Imagine a hotel owner who dislikes foreigners and has little respect for his guests and your'e just a little way there. The writing, the timing, the characters....everything is utterly perfect! John Cleese and his then wife Connie Booth could think of nowhere else to go after two series, so they called it quits and left on a high. What they didn't realise was the fact that they gave us what is without doubt one of the finest and funniest comedy legends. Americans have a taste for this kind of peculiar British humour, we British also adore it. You are in for a treat! Don't miss.
0440539811|2.0|Most of the reactions to this book seem to center around Wilson's half-baked &quot;philosophy&quot;, which is the same as that of every other hedonist--to get drugged up, hide your head in the sand and pretend that everything is or will be all right (Wilson predicted in the 70s that by the 90s we would all be immortal space cadets; I am not making this up). No one seems to respond to this book, or any of his other novels, simply as works of fiction, and it is fortunate for him that they do not. Like the rest, this novel is populated by cliched, cardboard cutout characters spouting dialogue so unnatural that even a TV sitcom rings more true; in addition it is weighed down not only by its phony, derivative plot but by an appendix full of cross-referenced subplots that do nothing to advance the story but do much to advance Wilson's and Shea's self-promotion as masters of occult and conspiratorial information. The latter, maybe; the former, never. Wilson cannot understand religion, occultism or mysticism on any but the shallowest level, and his dedication to escapism makes sure that it will stay that way. No wonder most of his fans are such adolescents; Wilson has been seventeen his whole life.
B00003CXMG|5.0|This won't be to everyone's taste but it's an affectionate nod to the pop scene of the early seventies which by today's standards seems like classical! It's a semi-autobigraphical account by Cameron Crowe who really was a teenage music hack. Fans of the era will love it and will particulary enjoy the outstanding soundtrack which really does stand out. I get the feeling this was a labour of love and it shows. All of the cast are superb and gave a lot to this film. The DVD has all the usual extras. It's just a drama with a little comedy thrown in but if you are old enough to remember buying a copy of Elton John's 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' or 'Led Zep 3', you will adore this.
B000059PRW|4.0|A movie showing three vignettes based on short stories from Stephen King.<br />Story #1<br />A wooden indian comes to life to seek revenge. A great performance by George Kennedy, but the vignette is quite slow up to the point where the indian comes to life.<br />Story #2<br />Four teenagers goes out for a swim but gets stranded on a raft with an oil-like blob wanting their blood. This is the best of all the three stories; you'll love the ending, because it is unexpected!<br />Story #3<br />A woman comes home after spending using the services of a male prostitute. On the way home, the woman runs over a hitchhiker; the woman then becomes haunted by the dead hitchhiker. There is a cameo appearance by Stephen King as a truck driver in this vignette.<br />In addition to the three short stories, there is a short animation sequence about carnivorous venus fly traps.<br />The second vignette about the raft was the only thing that makes this film worth watching; it was the best story out of both Creepshows one and two, and without it, this would've been a below-average flick!
B000001Y5X|5.0|Manson's first album and one of the most unique albums ever.  Quirky and violent, funny yet scary.  This is the work of a trully original group.  This album sounds as if a 10 year old kid, full of sugar, hatred and cartoons decided to put his dreams in music.  From not growing up (Snake eyes and sissies)to monsters (Cyclops).  It also takes a tour of American needs as the title suggests from drugs&amp;public acceptance (Dope Hat) to murder and incest (Wrapped in plastic). A psychedlic album that should be cherished by all the kids in adults' bodies in the world.
6304288433|3.0|The movie starts right after the original ended, with the killer, Michael Myers, on his way to Haddonfield Memorial hospital to kill the surviving female from the last film.<br />I was disappointed at this film; it was no where near as scary and creepy as the original. The killer no longer hides in the shadows, and the killings are not as creative as the first film. The only thing that are present in this flick from the original is the score by John Carpenter. There is one portion of the movie that didn't make sense; Laurie Strode's reason for leaving her bed wasn't explained in the movie.<br />The first &quot;Halloween&quot; was a classic; &quot;Halloween II&quot; is average.

0064471837|5.0|Garth Nix, author of the wonderful fantasy series The Seventh Tower, is a literal master of fantasy in his first and epic novel Sabriel. He creates a world different than ours with elaboration and stunning characters against a vivid backdrop of a classic, epic story. Using the masterful fantasy like Philip Pullman creates and an epic story that follows my favorite author as well, Garth Nix has written a fabulous novel destined to be a classic. Eighteen year old Sabriel is a prefect, but she knows that someday she must follow in the path of her destiny. Her father, the Abhorsen, disappeared when she was younger, as if she had been abandoned. But when she learns her father is trapped amidst the World of the Dead, she journeys to save him and, with the help of some friends, she faces foes and creatures that only a necromancer like she must learn to drive away. With a world of life and a world of dead that surround her as if one was above her and the other below, she must battle a great and powerful foe: the darkest soul, a Dead, Kerrigor: A foe so dark and unfathomable, Sabriel just may not survive... Garth Nix writes a beautiful and enchanting young adult fantasy novel that I recommend towards ages thirteen and up. Readers of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy and T.A. Barron's The Lost Years Of Merlin saga, will, undoubtedly, absolutely love this stunningly constructed novel of the wonderful Garth Nix.

6303471501|4.0|...have to say that's so different?  Well, this film isn't the post-apocalyptic one that I was led to believe it is.  Unless society is expected to have TV after a nuclear war, the second and third ones are the post-nuke war installments.  This film has a great start, lonnng middle, and a great end.  The action portions of the film are the beginning and the end, while the portions in the middle are more like melodrama.  Big exception is that some &quot;Action&quot; scenes are more like &quot;Horror&quot; scenes, especially the two kids being assaulted in their fire-paint car.  The film does have a low-budget feel, with some film cuts being repeated.  The dubbing doesn't help, though I thought I heard some Australian in the first chase scene [the crazy dude's chick riding in the passenger seat] and in the TV anchorman.  Some of the music also seems over the top, too.  For all its faults, it succeeds as a whole, and worth watching if you like action films.
B00004VVNB|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie for years and I am pleased to see it finally coming out on DVD and with extras and a fabulous price!! It is interesting to note that the original age for people to die was 21 and not 30(read the book) but then Michael York could in no way pass for 21!<br />  Peter Ustinov and Jenny Aguter are two excellent actors who really make their characters believable. I loved all the cats when I was young and the images of the destroyed US civilization.
0520215850|4.0|this book was probably the best ive read in a long time.  The military tactics and the swift movements of the battalions/division were so smooth.  As a military enthusiast, i felt obliged to read this book, but after reading it, i knew this was a book to read over and over and over again.  After studying the Chinese dynasties in sixth grade, i had somewhat of a clear view of the Han dynasty. As the three kingdoms rage in battle and buracreacy, this story holds not only adventure, but important morals in life.
0060392886|5.0|This is a must have for all crue fans. Very interesting and hard to put down. Parts of it even made me blush!I learned many things I did'nt realize came along with the music biz! Money well spent.
0380002930|5.0|Superb!  What more can I say?  Adams has proved again and again to be a master of storytelling and myth weaving.  This book remains my all time favorite.  Watership Down's rabbit society alows us to see the world through a lense tinted in far different shade than we see in our ordinary lives.  The characters face and overcome obstacles that face us every day.  Strength to defy convention, out-doing brawn with brains, and many others.  And it is all depicted on the intruiging background of the rabbits who, in this book at least, have their own government, own language, own religion.  I beseech everyone to treat themselves to this masterful creation, which still remains my Champion Book.
B000055Y0X|5.0|&quot;How Does The Fate of the World hang on a Coca-Cola Machine?&quot; &quot;Why Did U.S. H-Bombers attack Russia?&quot; &quot;What is the Doomsday device?&quot; &quot;Why was Gen. Jack D. Ripper so obsessed with fluids.&quot; &quot;Why did Dr. Stranglove want 'Ten Females to each Male?&quot; &quot;Where was the Red Premier When The Hot-line Rang?&quot;<br />Well, guess what. you're never going to be able to answer these questions unless you watch this cinematic masterpiece. Directed by Stanley Kubrick. Who is, by far one of the greatest directors in the history of the Motion Picture. To prove it, three of his films are even on the AFI's top 100 greatest films. 2001, A Clockwork Orange, and of course this movie milestone. jam-packed with an excellent ensemble cast topped with the triple-threat performances by Peter Sellers as Mandrake, The Prsident, and the eccentric ex-nazi, Dr. Strangelove. and also joining a vast array of notable talent, including, George C. Scott playing the pure blood american General Buck Turgidson, Slim Pickens as the sharp Major Kong, who rides the 40 megaton nuclear bull down to it's target, Sterling Hayden as the liquid loving Gen. Ripper, and Even a very young James Earl Jones. <br />Kubrick had alot of gall to make a comedy about nuclear paranoia right in the midst of a time of nuclear paranoia. But the movie ended up surprisingly well-recieved. Kubrick had spanwed a comedy that could only be summed up in one word... INSANE!!! <br />The story begins with Gen. Ripper ordering a nuclear attack on Russia which, in effect would cause a massive retaliation back at the U.S. Now it's a race against time to prevent a nuclear holocaust, and still keep good relations with Russia. &quot;Dimitri, I understand how you feel. How do you think I feel?&quot;<br />After all these years &quot;Strangelove&quot; is still one one the funniest films to ever be made. It's also one of the more pure comedies ever made. It's rare you come across a comedy withoutthe use of perverted jokes consisting of rude bodily functions and dirty sex. &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; possesses a wonderful balance of verbal and physical comedy. An example being a hilarious scene where Strangelove is promoting an absurd notion of reproducing the human race in bunkers while dueling with his malignant right hand. It doesn't get better than that. <br />The special edition DVD pays an excellent tribute to both Staney Kubrick and The film with two highly in-depth behind the scenes featurettes, and along with an also humorus theatrical trailer. This is one of the most influential films ever made so please watch it and see what I mean.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I really do not understand the harsh criticism this CD has received.<br />I've listened to it for about over a year now and cannot find anything to criticize except that it's best not to listen to it on your headphones at work because everyone will wonder why you're so happy!<br />I grew up with Santana, but didn't worship his work. I like this CD for what it is...a set of happy, playful, contemporary music. Maybe it doesn't break new groud or maybe it fails to be purely Latino or purely jazz/whatever else, but it makes me want to get up and move....and it's fun and happy and it makes me smile.<br />Enough said.<br />Enjoy!
B00003CXRM|5.0|This film was witty, funny, and beautifully filmed.  The cinematography alone was worth the price of admission.  From the opening shot of the movie I was blown away at how breath taking the landscapes were.  Everything about this film just felt incredibly vivid. The use of filters also lent a unique, old-world, feel to the shots (not quite sepia-toned, but similar). Add to this a clever, hysterical, script and a wonderful cast, George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Goodman are standouts in the movie, and you have the makings of what is arguably the best film of the year.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Many like to compare her to Tracy Chapman, Me'shell N, or Erykah Badu but India.Arie proves on her debut album that she does have a truly unique &quot;message to share with&quot; us all.<br />Her lyrics are a testament to the trials of loving, and the difficulties in discovering self-love and self-awareness.  Her first release, Video is a tribute to every woman who has forgotten how to look in the mirror and see the beauty.    Back to the Middle reminds us all how we get caught up in the struggle of every day life as we strive for those goals and achievements.  Unfortunately, we soon forget the true motive and impetus behind our actions; therefore, only by &quot;coming back to the middle will we ever reach the top.&quot;<br />Brown Skin is a sensuous exploration of the sheer beauty of the body and the joy that comes from loving.<br />Time and again, India's lovely melodies and perceptive lyrics reteach us how beautiful the &quot;Simple&quot; things in life truly are--it's up to us to make sure we don't lose sight of that beauty.
0060977264|5.0|By The River Piedra, I Sat Down And Wept is an interesting book, full of love and spirituality that teaches us that luve during our childhood is so important that a lot of times can culminate an older age. All relationships that exist on this earth should be based on love,because even though the differences if love exists everything is possible.<br />I really recommed this book to people who enjoy reading romance stories.
B000003489|4.0|The degree of energy applied, and intensity of the beat, are almost rock-like.  Coltrane is putting a lot into it here.<br />Although he's known more for his playing than his compositions, John has some great writing moments on here that turned everyone's head around at the time, particularly the lovely &quot;Naima&quot;.<br />The music's fast, frenetic, full of spiraling cyclical forms, a little bit like what Miles Davis was doing and would do.  But (for better or worse) with a sense of urgency fueling it.  It's overrated, but it's good music.
B000001FLA|3.0|Yes, it's dated. Yes, It's short. I know that. But, it's the greatest exercise for guitarists. Yngwie maybe can't write mainstream stuff, be he is perhaps the greatest guitar soloist. I really liked Crying because of it's flamenco style. Other than the other instrumental, this is just cheesy 80's rock with excellent solos. Pretty good.
B000002KO3|4.0|Whereas the Heads' first three albums were the sound of a four-piece band (playing very cleanly), this is the sound of an augmented band full of very talented musicians, together in the service of David Byrne and Brian Eno's art aesthetic, which was now geared around African and African-American (i.e. FUNK) sounds.<br />And it's pretty interesting, though Byrne and Eno's own &quot;My Life In The Bush of Ghosts&quot; is stronger stuff.<br />The grooves here are strong, multi-layered washes of chattering guitars and drums.  What has really survived the ages are the subtle pleasures on here - Adrian Belew's wonderful guitar solos (his solo on &quot;Born Under Punches&quot; is truly asytonishing, and makes you wonder whether he might be Jimi Hendrix reincarnated), or the synth (probably Brian Eno?) making those ghostly John Hassell-inspired sounds on &quot;Houses in Motion&quot; (which Hassell himself also plays on).  <br />The songs are strong in their own very idiosynchratic way.  The album was a wonder of its time, and an interesting artifact today.
B00000IP3S|5.0|It is simply their best. Probably the best power metal album known to mankind. Hansi is an incredible singer. The lyrics are improving, but the music is much better than their older albums. Andre and Marcus are guitar kings, and a true drummer genius, Thomen, backs it up. &quot;I'm Alive&quot; and &quot;Mordred's Song&quot; should be put into music videos. WHY AREN'T THEY POPULAR OVER HERE? They have every thing for a great metal band. Unlike those wanna-be metal artists like Limp Bizkit, this band, along with Iced Earth, knows metal. DON'T BREAK THE CIRCLE!
B00004Z511|5.0|Every review of this album that I have read has used the word departure or a simile of it.  They know the obvious.  Radiohead is known for departing from where ever they are at.  Each album has been a movement to a new place.  They don't necessarily eschew where they were, but they definitely feel they must move on. Kid A is a powerful example of where music can go when guided by the right people.  Talent in this age is defined by imagination.  The ability to take a world where &quot;everything has been done&quot; and yet be able through imagination and intellect to find a new way.  Kid A is a new way.  Distorted guitars, modernistic synth music, horns remincient of John Coltrane, vocals that are woven into the rest of the sound.  This is not a album for everyone.  Most of the ablum is dissonant and most of the lyrics are unintelligible which has always been a hard sell (Shoenberg, Stravinsky, Charlie Parker and John Coltrane are a few examples of those that have struggled with with the edge of what can be beautiful and yet be very close to impossible to understand).  I highly recommend this Work to anyone that is into music and want to see a new bend in the path.
B000009EAD|5.0|What could get any better than this? Jon Schaffer and Larry Tarnowski are now the masters of thrash. Great solos, although it dosen't compete with their old guitarist, Randy Shavner.(Sorry if i spelled it wrong)&quot;Burning Times&quot; is a great song about the Inquisition, and the song about Christ(Melancholy) has an amazing hook. There's so much metal goodness on this. Even an instumental(Iced Earth hasen't done an instrumental since 1991)! And Matthew Barlow has to be one of the best singers of metal. A intresting cocept for the trilogy. About a prophecy saying that a thing, not a man, will destroy mankind 10,000 years from now and rewrite history. COOL! &quot;Watching Over Me&quot; is a great ballad to a friend who died in a motorcycle accident. I forgot his name, but he shall be missed. Excellent album.

0440180295|3.0|There are few books that contain the events about an author's life in which they are not addressed as autobiographies. Kurt Vonnegut's  Slaughterhouse Five; the Children's Crusade is one of those few. This story is of Vonnegut's life, but his life is changed by adding a few fictional plots throughout the novel. However, there are many references to factual events that occurred to him as well. Vonnegut may have done a fine job describing the exciting events of his life, and creating new incidents, but that was not enough to keep my full attention while reading this novel. Quite frankly, this piece of literature was not exactly a `page turner.'  His idea to create his life under the name of someone else, (Billy Pilgrim), was intended to give himself relief from the way he felt about his time in war. Billy Pilgrim was what Vonnegut called \\"unstuck in time.\\" He travels back and forth to different time periods in his life. In the novel his first occurrence of being \\"unstuck in time,\\" happens just before he is captured behind German lines. When he once returns from his time travels, he is taken to Dresden where he is kept as a prisoner. During the bombing of Dresden, he hides in an airtight meat locker, and emerges to find a city of annihilation. Vonnegut, also known as Billy, feels guilty for being saved while thousands of others were killed. His whole life from that moment on is full of sorrow and guilt. He cannot get rid of the feeling he could have done something to help the others who died, and he feels he is a horrible person for saving only himself.   Vonnegut does not do a high-quality job of venting his true feelings of his time in war. He avoids actually saying directly that Billy Pilgrim feels responsible for many of the other deaths. He tries to get his point across without actually literally saying that he suffers guilt. The way that he addresses it is very indirectly. He goes about it by almost flat out saying that he is insane. He accuses his mentality forthe death of the people rather than blaming his decision.  Billy Pilgrim, through the entire novel, is a man losing more and more of his wit each day. It is shown in the novel that he is losing his mind for the reason that he claims \\"toilet plunger shaped aliens\\" kidnappe him and take him to their planet as a hostage. This is evidence that not only has he lost his psyche, but it also proves that he repeatedly has visions of being taken hostage over and over again. He continually remembers the point in his life where he was held hostage, hence the apparition of the aliens. This confirm that he must think about the event at Dresden all of the time, and must in some way be disturbed by it. After being bombed in Dresden he, meaning Billy or Vonnegut, is not capable of living an enjoyable life. He is tortured by his thoughts. From then on he is doomed to a life of anguish. Therefore, Vonnegut has created this novel to spice up his history to make it seem as though he did not have a poor life. He also created this piece of literature to apologize, in some very strange way, for have only saving himself. Writing this novel produced for him to relieve his feelings of his war time and to show that he not only thought of himself, but the others also involved in the war.  I feel that Vonnegut wrote a very confusing and choppy piece of literature. It is not consistent in where he is going through the novel, and many times there are gaps, as too what will happen next. He leaves many things up to the reader to decide what will occur after that. I do respect and give Vonnegut much credit for creating a piece that contains nothing like I have ever read before. This novel contains a lot of fictional experiences tied into true and real life events in history. He has made a story that is supposed to be some what real life, but Vonnegut has added in many things that are difficult to consider.  He has created a new genre of literature that I would have to title; \\"fictional reality.\\" Thistitle is appropriate simply because Vonnegut ties in many of the events of World War Two into his novel, but also includes prophesies and illusory characters into his narrative.   There are many stories that I would prefer to read more than this novel. Such as Cat's Cradle, simply because it is better written. I enjoyed this novel much more because it is completely fiction, as apposed to half real life and the other half imaginary. This novel is much more entertaining, since it is easier to picture what is happening, rather than being confused throughout the entire plot.   Overall, I perceived Slaughterhouse Five; the Children's Crusade to be somewhat strange and intriguing, yet it did not have enough `pizzazz' to keep me glued to the novel. Also, it lacked many characteristics and qualities that I look for in a book. Once again, I do want to give credit to Kurt Vonnegut for writing such a creative and unique piece, but to anyone who has not yet read this novel, I do not strongly recommend reading it.
B000056K04|4.0|I like alot of this CD but some songs aren't even stomachable such as &quot;Mother Father&quot;, etc. Too bad Santana's guitar skills had to be wasted on such a stupid song.
B00005BL2A|3.0|While the album is definitely not &quot;exciting&quot; (at times, I almost dose off listening to it), Exciter is not the worst thing I've ever purchased.  Because it is DM, it has great lyrics, however some songs drone on.  Dream On is a great song, and there or 3 or 4 other songs that would make great singles.  No where near the best DM album, but it will stay in my six disc changer for now.
B000000IUH|5.0|Unbelievable beauty - if there is such a thing.<br />Forget Schulze, forget Tangerine Dream, forget Jan Hammer and Brian Eno. Forget Vangelis. Forget Tomita, Kitaro and Carlos. Forget Enigma, Orbit, Autechre, The Orb, Aphex Twin and Stearns. Forget Bach, Mozart, Palestrina and Vivaldi. Forget anything else you've ever heard before: Equinoxe is captured beauty - albeit briefly.<br />While Oxygene was the song of air, Equinoxe is the song of water. The music on this album inspired me to study music. To this day, I'm still moved whenever I hear it.<br />Put on your headphones, turn off the light, lie down, and lose yourself.
B000002TPS|5.0|This is THE Megadeth album. These people who say that 'Deth sold out don't know what they are talking about. This is great Hard Rock/Metal. A Tout Le Monde may be the greatest Megadeth song ever. I never thought there would be a metal song that you could say this about, but A Tout Le Monde is a beautiful song. All around a 5 star A+++ album!
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember is a fictional novel with more to offer than an average love story. Nicholas Sparks creates in-depth characters who are sensitive and receptive to life. The main character, Landon Carter, tells his story of self-exploration which dates back to the year 1958. Landon lives in the small town of Beaufort located in North Carolina. This setting is significant because it plays a large role in the kinds of relationships the characters have with each other. Being a small southern town, the people are close with one another and know everything about one another. Landon is a senior in high school who is searching for something. He bases many opinions on the way things look and tends to go along with the crowd. Landon's outlooks, and views on life change throughout the novel because of a special relationship with a character named Jamie Sullivan. Jamie is an admirable person who is self-confident, secure with herself, and entirely selfless. Being the daughter of a widowed Baptist minister, Jamie possesses a strong faith. She carries a Bible with her at school, cares for orphaned children, and rescues wounded animals. Jamie is different from the other girls at her high school. She doesn't pay attention to how her hair looks, or the latest fashion trends, she is entirely devoted to helping other people and putting others first. With a twist of fate, two opposite personalities are unpredictably brought together to form a unique relationship.<br />The story mainly focus's on the growth of Landon's character and the romantic relationship that is formed between Landon and Jamie. Through different events in the novel, the quality of Landon's character and the quality of the relationship improves. For example, Jamie brings Landon with her to the children's orphanage and this experience opens his eyes and causes him to be more sensitive. He not only changes himself by doing things with Jamie, he also learns from her forgiveness. In the first stage of their friendship, Landon mistreats her because he cares too much about what his peers think. Jamie possesses the quality of forgiveness and is able to pardon Landon for his actions even though she was deeply hurt. Landon falls in love with Jamie for her soul, and for her compassion. Jamie falls in love with Landon's sincerity and his ability to change and accept things. The two teenagers are inseparable and devote all of their time to each other. They share everything in each other's lives except one secret that Jamie has kept from the whole town including her soul-mate. In the end, Jamie is not strong enough to carry this heavy burden. She must rely on the sweet love of Landon to get her through her life-changing secret. <br />After I finished this novel, I felt as though I had been through so much. I felt the emotional effects of the story deeply. I was so attached to the novel; any moment of free time, I read a new chapter. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy the story, I let myself become friends with the characters. When they were sad, I was down; when they were elated, I felt joy. This novel taps into human emotion so profoundly. I cried for twenty minutes at the end of the novel. It left such an impact on me. I felt such a connection to the growth the characters went through. I examined my own life and it caused me to be more conscience of certain aspects of my own character. Jamie's strong devotion to God helps me examine my own faith. I believe in God and I try to base my life around my dedication to a higher being. I admire Jamie for her altruistic ways of caring for others and putting other's needs before her own. <br />Landon learns so many truths about life, about love and about humanity. He learns what true and unconditional love is. He learns what it means to treat others with respect, and he learns to be confident with his own convictions. After finishing the story, I was left with a feeling and emotion of complete happiness. I was left smiling (even with tears streaming down my cheeks) at the lives of the characters. Landon has been through so much exploration and has found himself. He forgets the norm and rebels against trying to fit in. This touches me deeply because I understand how hard it is to soul-search; I understand how hard it is to look past the trivial events of high school and to be an individual. This novel is about growing up. It is hard for Jamie to rely on someone else to carry her secret. However, she is able to, and learns how important her soul-mate really is to her survival. He is the difference between living and dying. Through the life lessons, the spiritual epiphanies, and the self-discovery, I have never felt so connected with a novel. I can relate my life to the novel so easily and all of the events the characters go through. I will forever remember these two friends of mine. Even though they are literary characters, they have opened my eyes to a world of selflessness, devotion, and most importantly, yet simply, love.
0307155102|5.0|I think I could highly recommend all of Richard Scarry's books, but this is a one of the classics. This is the book I most identify with Richard Scarry. A large book with loads of things on every page - all with the word underneath. In addition, the cover has numbers to 20 and the letters of the alphabet all with the appropriate corresponding items. This more than anything taught my son not only how to count but what numbers actually mean. I am now buying our second copy; our first is missing it's cover and is torn on many pages. My son is almost 4 years old and has been &quot;reading&quot; this book since he was 9 months old (to himself)! Both he and my husband are big Richard Scarry fans and have converted me. I am buying this book again to begin teaching my son to read. <br />I highly recommend this book for children from babies to early school age. I don't know a child in my family who doesn't love it!
B00004XOWM|2.0|When I first got into Limp Bizkit it was right after the release of &quot;Signigicant Other,&quot; which showed the extreme talent of the four bands memebers. In all of their songs they weaved an intense energy, unmatched by any other band, which led me to believe that their next album, &quot;Chocolate Starfish and The Hot Dog Flavored Water,&quot; would be just as good, if not better. I was gravely mistaken. &quot;Starfish&quot; is an album that was put out there just because the band thought they should make another CD. It seems like Fred Durst only wrote half of a song (for every song) and repeated it two or three times to make it a 3 or 4 minute song. This album is not worth your money, however, it is not without it's few strong points. A few of their songs, like My Way and The Mission Impossible Soundtrack, show their passion and love of music like &quot;Significant Other&quot; did. In the end, this CD is nothing to run out and buy, especially if you are a hard core LB fan, because all it will do is kill your love of them.

020530902X|5.0|Strunk and White's Elements of Style is still the most useful tool for clear and concise writing.  There are occasions when I do consult 'Strunk and White' to verify that a phrase or word is the 'right one'.<br />A decade ago, I worked at a law firm where each new associate was provided with an office furnished with a desk, a couple of chairs for clients, and a bookcase.  A new Webster's dictionary and 'Strunk and White' were among the provided furnishings.  Those perks ought to be offered at every firm where clear communication is becoming more and more vital.

6305609691|5.0|A while back (been at least a year) I gave this film a low rating. That review was based on the memory of seeing the film when I was young. I now own the film and watch it frequently. Its a masterpiece. Its not so much a story of Vietnam as it is a story about us and what we are capable of in certain situations. Any one of us can become the things we hate and despise given the right circumstances. This film could have been set in any war, time, or location and been just as powerful.
B0000029GA|5.0|Every every every time that I listen to this classic album,I get chills.Nas just comes with some deep poetry,rhyming over some of the best Hip Hop beats ever made.Even the album cover possesses an incredible art-like aesthetic.I have had this album since it first came out in '94,and as the years have passed,'Illmatic' just keeps shinning like a true gem.I remember when I first heard &quot;It Ain't Hard To Tell,&quot; my mouth simply dropped to the floor!I knew that this deput was something special,and I had to get it immediately.Any true lover of Hip Hop,absolutely,without a doubt,must have this album in their collection.It has certainly become one of the strongest offerings that Hip Hop has ever been given.Pure and colossal head-knodding-mind-meditation graces each track.I'm about to listen to it again!Peace.......
0060392886|5.0|First let me say that i can not believe this band is still alive!!     i thought i read everything about sex drugs and rock and roll until I read The Dirt. VH1's Motely Crue's Behind the Music only touched the surface. The real story is in this book! I urge you to pick up this book you will not be sorry.    I found myself gasping at every page! I can't wait for the movie! I can't say enough about this book it's just simply an awesome read
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I was extremely impressed with both Nicole Kidman's and Ewan McGregor's vocal talents as well as the different yet tasteful new spins on some old favorite songs.

0452282152|5.0|Tracy Chevaliar has accomplished something I have considered many times when viewing art....&quot;Who is the muse?&quot;  She shares that information with us in a fictional account of Griest, &quot;The Girl with the Pearl Earring.&quot;  Her words are such lovely compliments to the visual.  I was astounded at her ability to create the perfect tale for the picture, and bring to life every aspect of the art.  This was a joy to read and I recommend it to all who love to learn history through fiction.  I was not that acquainted with Vermeer's work, but now I am captivated by it. I wish I could be among the lucky patron's in NYC who are privy to a showing of Vermeer's masterpieces at the MET, inspired by the response to Chevalier's book.  BUT, I will settle for having had the grand opportunity to read this book, and be privy to Vermeer's and Griet's world in Delft.  Wonderful, wonderful, reading!!!!!!
B000002KKK|5.0|This is the first ZZ Top album that I've heard, and wow I was really impressed. If your knowledge of this band extends only to that song from the pantyhose commercials, then you need to check out Deguello. It's a fabulous blues rock album, produced before the band went slick and commercial in the 80's. There's only one &quot;filler&quot; song, Manic Mechanic. The rest of the album is killer. Great songs such as &quot;I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide&quot;, &quot;Cheap Sunglasses&quot; and &quot;A Fool For Your Stockings&quot; can be found here. If you're looking for a good early ZZ album, this is the one. Now if only the label would rerelease the other 70's ZZ Top albums with the original sound mix. Thankfully, Deguello was not tampered with.
0812589041|5.0|Every couple of months I ask one or two of my friends to come up with some books I should read but that I haven't yet read. This time both friends listed Ender's Game as their top pick. I had heard alot about it so I went to the library and got it.     Wow! It was an amazing book. I couldnt put it down. Here are the details: It's about a little kid in the future who has been picked as mankind's last hope. The book is about his struggle to come to terms with who he is and why he is so important. Along the way he learns alot about how humans react to each other and about how life isn't as simple as it seems: sometimes you have to make choices not for your benefit but others as well.      It was such a great book that I couldn't stop thinking about it after I finished. Orson Scott Card's writing brilliance is shown in this book more than any other. I would recommend it to anyone.     Other good books by Orson Scott Card include: &quot;Pastwatch-the Redemtion of Christopher Colombus&quot;, &quot;The Memory of Earth&quot;, and &quot;The Seventh Son&quot;.

B00004ZAV3|3.0|Any Beatles' lover would have trouble understanding the rationale behind the release of this CD. Most reviewers now agree that the 'remastering' of the tracks don't really reveal themselves, leading one to the obvious conclusion that you're better off buying entire Beatles' albums instead of this collection.<br />The GOOD thing about this CD is that it gives younger listeners a wonderful introduction to the Beatles, and will hopefully prompt them to go out and get all the other albums as well. The BAD thing about this CD is that it totally ignores the fact that there are long-time Beatles fans around, and treats the solid Beatles fan community with little respect or sign of intelligence. While I personally think that the release of this album is solely for monetary gain, I must say that gathering together all their No. 1s in one place is a semi-nice idea. Or so I thought. Has anyone yet realized that many of these songs on here never really went to No. 1? Did the record company really think they could sneak this past longtime Beatles' fans? Obviously, they did, and they've also apparently gotten away with it.<br />In my opinion, the CD neglected many important songs from the latter half of the groups' career, and it contains way too much of their older stuff (how many compilations have included 'Love me do' and 'I want to hold your hand'? I've lost count).<br />The first half of the disc is chock-full of classic Beatles moments, and while this is a great thing, its really nothing new. If you own 'Past Masters' or any of the original albums, this comes as a letdown. 'Love me do', 'From me to you', 'She loves you', 'A Hard Day's Night', and 'Ticket to ride' are all here, and the first 17 songs are all from the early Beatles. The spotlight then abruptly shifts to the late 60's and includes all the usual - 'Hey Jude', 'The Long and Winding Road', etc.<br />When I realized that many of the songs on here did not really go to No. 1, I was irritated by the fact that the record company could have included some truly Beatlesque compositions. For instance, the entire 'Magical Mystery Tour' EP is neglected on this record. 'I am the Walrus' would have provided this CD with that extra something, I am sure. Also, some of the choice cuts from 'Abbey Road' go totally unincluded, and don't let me get started on the snub that 'Sergeant Pepper's' gets on this CD. In what has to be the most marked insult to a Beatles fan, there is not ONE SONG from that album, which I consider the finest Beatles album ever.<br />For this reason, I think this CD is a joke, played by an ever-hungry record company on a gullible public. This is sad, because The Beatles had some excellent work in their day, and they are still remembered by their more 'popular' tunes. And while its great that this compilation will influence a whole new generation, its also sad that its chosen to show the finger to a whole set of fans to whom the Beatles owed their success.<br />Beatles Albums to own :<br />1.

6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the Shell is one of those pieces of anime that has to sit on your shelf, the animation is flawless, the story deep and compelling.  If you're really in to DBZ and more...action driven stuff than you may find the need to think while watching it a bit cumbersome, but it speaks to something that only a few other movies do.  If you hate to think about anything beyond the flurry of cartoon kicks ...than you probably won't like it, but if you're into anime for the stories than you will.
B000002UAX|5.0|As most other reviews state, this is simply the best Beatles album. There are many different types of songs, and this album truly displays the artistic genius of the Beatles and proves that they were able to be successful in whatever style of music they wrote. This album contains what, in my view, is the greatest Beatles song ever- Helter Skelter. But I won't speculate on individual songs, but I would like you to know that this is filled with tons of good songs. It is amazing that none of these ever became widely popular, when compared to the Ballad of John and Yoko. (Not that that wasn't a good song. I don't mean to offend anyone, but in my view that was a song that I deem not worthy of being a No. 1 hit.) But anyways, this was tons of good songs and there is always a song for you no matter what type of mood you are in. I would suggest anyone get these CDs.
B000002UAU|5.0|I don't have the CD of this album, but I do own the origional 33 record album, and I love it! It has a great mix of styles of songs on it and is a must have for any beatles fan. I am 16 and always liked the beatles before but when my dad pulled out this album I only wanted to hear more!
B000058BGZ|5.0|Alfred Brendel has done three recordings of Schoenberg's Piano Concerto, and I own two of them (the DG one with Kubelik and the much later one on Philips, the latter nla).  I previously thought Brendel's latest recording (with Gielen at the podium) to be the last word concerning this concerto, but I was wrong.  Uchida and Boulez are much more fiery, employing a very wide spectrum of dynamics and articulation (which Schoenberg's scores demand).  I thought the first movement was a bit sluggish at first, but it works beautifully, and the more contrapuntal variations are more clearly focussed because of the added spaciousness (though not even Boulez's legenday ear could clarify the very thick textures of some passages).  The second movement has a greater sense of angst and conflict than Brendel and Gielen, and the third movement more pain.  Brendel and Gielen are more playfully nonchalant in the last movement.  Uchida and Boulez seem to portray the movement as having an eerie undurcurrent, as if the troubles of the second and third movements are still kept in mind.<br />The solo piano items are also very good, though I have some reservations.  It surprises me that Uchida executes a crescendo instead of the printed decrscendo in one passage of Op. 11 No. 1 (Uchida is usually very faithful to the score).  But Op. 11 No. 3 is incredibly intense, more so than the recordings by Gould or Pollini (though Pollini's recording is on the whole very good).  Op. 19 is performed with utmost sensitivity and warmth -- the bells of the last piece are exquisitely voiced and controlled.  Webern's Variations are also warmly expressive -- the third movement's closing variation seems to disappear into the ether (as it should), but the second movement is rather slow, diminshing the sense of manic energy that it should have.  Uchida's performance of Berg's Sonata is one of the finest ever recorded.  She takes Berg's numerous tempo changes to heart and follows them more closely than any other recording I've listened to (compare Pollini, for example).  The result is very intense yet also very coherent, as it should be.<br />Those of you who love these works (as I do) should not hesitate.  This is the best recording of Schoenberg's Piano Concerto so far.
0425152251|5.0|I picked up &quot;Sophie's World&quot; on a whim, where it was displayed on a table near the cash register. I don't know have much knowledge about philosophy, and although I realize this book barely scratches the surface of some very deep thoughts, I still feel that Jostein Gaarder did a stupendous job in making philosophy feel accessible to me. It made me curious to know more, and if that's not the sign of a great book, then I guess I don't know what one is. <br />I skimmed through many of the reviews just now, even though I've already read the book, and I was able to see a general pattern: those that were inquisitive, open to new learning and a new way of considering our existence were wild about this book. Conversely, the ones that gave it low marks and unmercifully criticized the philosophical part smacked of former philosophy major flunkies with severe elitist, I'm-such-an-expert-in-the-field-sniff-sniff attitudes. What most of the low-scorers missed was that &quot;Sophie's World&quot; was never intended to be a comprehensive study in Western Philosophy, merely an introduction to waken sleeping minds. And to say things like Gaarder got Kant's ideas all wrong is, to say the very least, highly subjective (and open to philosophical discussion). And for crying out loud, these nasty critics should learn to relax a little and have a good time with a very &quot;novel&quot; novel. Gads, what snobbery.<br />Read the book and enjoy it for the ride it gives. It's much better than the average schlop that's flooding the market.
0060934913|4.0|As a &quot;foodie&quot; and amatuer chef I was excited when I read the reviews of &quot;Kitchen Confidential,&quot; and promised myself to buy the paperback when it became available.  I did, and was not disappointed.  As food writing goes, Bourdain doesn't go into great detail about the food so much as the people who prepare it, providing an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at the restaurant business. Bourdain's style of writing is easy to read and can often cause one to laugh out loud at his experiences in the kitchen.  I used to want to be a chef, but Bourdains' book goes a long way to convincing me to stay on this side of the commercial kitchen door.
0140177396|5.0|Simply a masterpiece of short fiction.  The personalities of the characters are well depicted and blended together.  A truly touching story with a twist to the ending.  Just read it.  You'll be glad you did.
1573226521|5.0|The book The Beach by Garland is very interesting, non-stop page turner. When I read the book, I read it from front to back in one day, all 500 some odd pages of it. Garland tells an intreging story of a group of travelers. You can tell Garland has had his share of traveling experience.   The begining starts with a murder of a diranged man named Daffy who leaves a map of a travelers pardise of the coast of Thialand to a young traveler Richard. Richard and two of his traveling partners set of for this paradise leaving all their grasp of sociaty and sanity.   This book is my favorite book I've read yet in my short life. Garland is a very discriptive writer and in The Beach he pants the picture of paradise and makes you feel Richards experience. After reading this book you'll really fell like you've been on a far away journey. I would recemend this book to anyone who can handle the slite violence.
B000003TAR|5.0|this is so badass. a really excellent cd and blows nevermind away. now this is deep stuff.
B000002GXJ|4.0|I recently purchased this recording without any preconceived ideas....I just saw it and bought it.  I thought it was quite good; the standout are &quot;Hotel California&quot;, &quot;I Can't Tell You Why&quot;, &quot;Seven Bridges&quot;, &quot;Desperado&quot;, and of course &quot;Life In The Fast Lane&quot;.  The whole set is quite good - for a live set.  I'm not sure what all the complaints regarding the remastering are all about.  A live album is going to have flaws that's why they are &quot;touched up&quot; for listener appeal; there's no such thing as a flawless concert.<br />This set is, for me, a good introduction to the Eagles music.  I found the two songs by presidential candidate Joe Walsh a pleasent surprise.  Over all, this would make a good addition to anyones cd library.
0064407667|2.0|I was looking for a book that would be as fun as reading Harry Potter and I heard that these books were what I was looking for. I'm 21 and LOVE Harry Potter but not these. I felt like I should be 10 yrs younger to read this. Just wasn't entertained at all. So overall, not a book for anyone just the little ones.
B00004RFDW|5.0|Forget anything negative you may have heard about this movie.  Forget any protestations that the story is not entirely true or that it presents some characters in a negative light.  This is a superb movie which will move you greatly.  When I first watched the movie, I was struck by the terrorization that this man suffered, the threats on his and his family's life, and ultimately the disruption of his marriage.  Regardless of the dramatized details, Jeffrey Wigand was threatened, sued, and was placed under extroardinary pressure not to tell the truth about a major public health issue.   This is a compelling story anyway you look at it.  <br />Both Russell Crowe and Al Pacino are excellent.  Russell Crowe has captured the essence of this man in a way that is uncanny when compared to the real Jeffrey Wigand.  His performance is a feat of acting.  Al Pacino is hard-hitting and electrifying.  Visually, the movie brings to life the sense of desparation and paranoia which the characters must have felt.  The score is haunting and moving as well.<br />Jeffrey Wigand left the tobacco company and became a high school teacher, winning the Teacher of the Year award in 1996.  This cannot be the same person that the tobacco industry has been trying to portray as a &quot;master of deception.&quot;  He is a true hero.
B00005B36H|5.0|Well first off I just want to say that all the people who rated this album lower than 5 stars has not really listened or grasped what tool set out to do. They make art, not mainstream crap. Lateralus is truly amazing in it's own way. I cant' say this is better than opiate or undertow or salival or even aenima. The reason being that I like them all the same, cause they are different albums with different messages and different ways of tool expressing themselves. If you truly enjoy tool, and are a hardcore fan, then you appreciate the way they, as an artist, express themselves. Would an artist paint the same thing each time, no of course not. I would recommend this album to anyone who appreciates music, and likes to hear a group unify themselves and express themselves in a way that no other band can do. Tool is the band of bands, they are in a league of their own, sure radiohead and NIN are great, but they dont' take you on the same journey as tool does. Thank you adam, maynard, danny and justin. These guys provide us with music that makes us think and appreciate the art side of music. TOOL FOREVER!!!!!

It is the tale of Bridget Jones, a thirty-two year old singleton who believes that her life would be perfect if she could a)lose 7 pounds, b)stop smoking, and c)oh I forget what c was... Anyway, it is in journal form detailing her life from January 1 to December 31 of one full year of hilarity. You will laugh, cry, and want to kick her in the head. Especially when you meet her mother. I suggest this to anyone looking for a book to laugh yourself silly with. After you get started, you'll never get enough of Bridget.

B00004T9UF|2.0|Eminem is the worst rapper that ive ever heard, he has no flow at all amd the only reason he has any popularity at all is production.  Nice hooks, sometimes a few lines of good rap, but overall it just another example of how bad music can be popular if the artist is liked.

B000006OBQ|5.0|Better than any other Sinatra live cd, is this one.  Sinatra and Basie.  You can't get any better than that.  A very distant second would be the Ella Fitzgerald and Nelson Riddle cd's, and MAYBE, tied with that, Nancy Wilson and George Shearing cd's.<br />At any rate, this cd will absolutely floor ya.  It captures Sinatra in absolutely fantastic form.  &quot;Fly me to the Moon&quot; never sounded better.  And, for a &quot;new&quot; song, he unveils &quot;It was a very good year.&quot;  It's unbelievable.  Add to that, a simply awesome &quot;monologue&quot; wherein he tells amazing stories of days spent breakin' his back with one-eyed laborers (and Louie Palash with tha gimpy leg), and leavin some serious loot down at the tables in Vegas (&quot;double down, always double down&quot;.....yeah, right ya no good palooka).<br />And, of course, you can never argue with the abilities of the awesome Count Basie.  Here too, as with Sinatra and Basie's &quot;It might as well be swing&quot;, the Basie orchestra is further adorned with magic by featuring the guidance/conducting of Mr. Quincy Jones.  Can you even argue with such merits?<br />This is an amazing cd....I can't say that enough.  Start with this, then get the other Sinatra-Basie team ups.  Then, without hesitation, get &quot;only the lonely&quot; and &quot;wee small hours&quot;....'cause it ain't always bright lights, good times, loose slots and fast women.....or is that loose women and fast slots??.....or....ah, never mind....ya get my drift.
B00003CXP1|5.0|...I am sure that you will find that [this movie] is a haunting and gripping depiction of how drug abuse depletes the lives of four individuals.  This film gives an insider's look into the \\"high\\" and psychosis and other primary effects of drug use.  It is unlike any other film ever made regarding the effects of drugs on the body.  I strongly recommend this film to anyone, and don't be close-minded like our friend, lil Richie.
0380788624|4.0|Like all the other Stephenson books I've read, I get the feeling that I've read this book before.  I just can't put my finger on where.<br />Beyond the feeling that this work isn't original, it is a fun read.  While I never loved the characters, and the plot never dazzled me, it was alot better than any other book I've read in awhile.
0767903862|4.0|Of course, I'm a big fan of Bill Bryson's and believe I've read all of his published books.  This has more serious prose than his other travel literature, so it might not be the right book to start with, if you're hoping to burst out laughing while commuting.  It's funny, but not as funny as his other books.<br />Bill (if I may presume this kind of familiarity) seems to have spent more time with the landscape and the history of Australia than the people, and that may be the reason.<br />Bill Bryson is a very good writer, and I'd recommend him highly for anyone who wants an entertaining, yet informative read.  Only one thing: he needs to cut back - way back - on his use of the term &quot;arresting.&quot;
B00004STPT|5.0|I just went to see \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and was very disappointed in the score composed by Hans Zimmer. I pulled my CD of  \\"GLADIATOR\\" from the shelf, removed the disc, placed it in the drawer and programmed 3 tracks: Track 1 `Progeny,' Track 10 `Strength and Honor' and track 16 `Honor Him.' When played they sum up what \\"GLADIATOR\\" was all about. You can program these 3 tracks for yourself. Yes, they end abruptly but they bring the idea of \\"GLADIATOR\\" the man full circle. When listening to this music again I remembered the feeling I got the first time I saw this great film. It is a film of epic proportions yet it remains on a most personal and emotional level in great part thanks to Hans Zimmer's haunting, beautiful and ever most reverently presented score. Hearing it a year later it is more moving than I ever imagined.
B000002HEP|5.0|When this album was released I was listening to thrash metal. Thrash hooked me when I was 12, and was quite simply the most exciting, intriguing and complicated music I had ever experienced. I find it a shame that in its success bands like Kyuss and Monster Magnet were overlooked, and strange that I came to discover them while thumbing through Amazon, lamenting the death of thrash and cursing the midget-weilding rapcore bands of today's music scene.... This is heavy stuff, and very guitar oriented. The vocals are a bit on the high end.. fine if you're over 22, (you probably have heard Chris Cornell's voice, whose voice I find is the closest to Garcia's that I can think of right now,) but if you're a nu-metal fan looking to expand your horizons, you might find the lyrics... uncomfortable. Keep listening, you'll soon understand.
0553106635|5.0|After reading the other two in the series, and reading this one I chose this one as my favorite! The plot is immense, and just pulls you in, and won't let go! if your going to read this book prepare for a roller coaster ride of emotions, because thats what it will give you.<br />     I highly recommend that you read the previous two first or the plot does not work. this book is for mature readers, and it is one of the best I've read. I await the fourth.
B00003000M|1.0|I listened to this cd and one star is a comliment.  This pathetic remix amounts to nothing less than musical necrophelia; taking the work of a great but dead artist and over-dubbing / remixing that work with flavor of the month &quot;artists&quot;.  This same kind of defilement occured when elevator musician Kenny G overdubbed on the great Louis Armstrong's music. Marley's great music/message should not be defiled by marginally talented artists; most of whom represent the exact opposite of what Bob Marley stood and fought for.  But Hey, Bob Marley is no longer with us to make the musical decisions, so let's just go ahead and remix his music as we please and make some quick bucks.  Skip this cd and buy the original recordings because they are light years better.  I recomend Survival as the greatest Bob Marley cd and after that Kaya.  Peace.
B000008H1Y|5.0|Jethro Tull have put out so many great albums in their long carrers.  In my opinion I would have to say that Songs From the Wood is prabrably their best.  It rates up in my top five albums. 1. Quadrophenia, The Who 2. Songs From the Wood, Jethro Tull 3. Crash, Dave Matthews Band 4. Tommy, The Who 5. Blood On the Tracks, Bob Dylan
B00005B36H|5.0|Very complicated, very psychedelic stuff. This is art, pure and simple... bear this in mind while listening to this album. Art is always pretentious in some way, and this album is no different.  If you like complexity, mind altering mood music and can listen to this with no distractions, you will likely be blown away.
B000003CMD|5.0|this cd is one of my top 3 allman brothers albums. every type of music the allmans have played thru their career is on this cd. straight out southern rock (ramblin man) blues (come and go blues) a classsic instumental (jessica). their trademark trading guitars are not here (this was the first studio album without duane allman) but chuck leavell does more than excellent trading with dicky betts. no, its not duane and not the same, but it works. listen to it straight thru and you will find an excellant work. (just in case you didn't know what happened to chuck leavell, he is now the rolling stones pianist)
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I think this album keeps getting better everytime I listen to it...which is almost everyday in the car on the way to work.  I don't want to over play the album but I can honestly say the band reached a creative crescendo of classic rage style with a truly patriotic message to the young peoples of America.  Definitely thought provoking and one of my favorite CDs.
B00004YW6I|5.0|Sarah Mac, Natalie Merchant, and Dido, take note: You can be a female superstar without being \\"girly.\\" PJ Harvey proves it brilliantly. She rises against the girls-versus-boys Lilith Fair mentality and delivers epic songs of universal appeal. She sings love songs with grit. Songs of...desperation and America's urban underbelly are presented in an array of wild arrangements. I own other PJ Harvey CDs, but none can match the bittersweet tunefulness of \\"Stories.\\" <br />This is one of those albums that you initally love for the hooks, and then find deeper, more satifying nuances in the songs with repeated listenings. After 4 months of listening, it's still in heavy rotation on my CD player. <br />Melodic songs with emotional heft and grade-A production. What more could a rock fan - male or female - want?
B000051YEG|5.0|For an overall view of Gainsbourg's work, common collections such as Comic Strip, Jazz dans le ravin, and Couleur Cafe are wonderful.  But this album is a standout.  It will come as a bit of a surprise to those who think of Gainsbourg solely in relation to the campiness, silliness, or sleaziness of more wellknown songs like bonnie and clyde, comic strip, and je t'aime moi non plus.  This is serious and powerful stuff.  I'm tempted to compare the style of the music, and the complexity of its orchestration, to the soundtrack to Jesus Christ Superstar.  But while that soundtrack swings between excessively silly and cloyingly melodramatic, L'histoire de melodie is, on the contrary, subdued, sultry, moody, and unsettling. Don't overlook this one.
B00005K9LN|5.0|I'm glad they decided to remaster this classic of heavy metal,but why mess with the track listing? My disc starts off with Rapid Fire,not Breaking the Law. A few other tracks are also out of order. Does anyone else have an opinon on this? Maybe I'm wrong?
B000002L82|5.0|Not only the best, and most unique, of New Order's albums, but also one of the best albums of the 80's.  Unlike anything else.  Dark, unsettling, and lovely.  Contrary to one reviewer's claim, this is far from &quot;dance music&quot;.  It has much more in common with Joy Division and the album &quot;Movement&quot; than the superficial dance tunes that would ultimately lead them to the miserable album &quot;Republic&quot;.  At the same time, however, it is quintessential New Order, and not, like Movement was, a poor modification of Joy Division.  The elements of dance music are there, but used more artfully, more powerfully, and with more sophistication.  As for the debate about &quot;Blue Monday&quot;: a classic dance song, a marvellous song, but it does not BELONG on Power Corruption and Lies.  Honestly, the album's too good for it.  This one, along with Substance, is the indispensible New Order.
0679879269|1.0|It seems like there is no middle ground.  People either loved or hated this book.  I am in the latter camp.  If only Mr. Pullman had stopped at Book II.
B000002KHB|5.0|One of the very few albums where there is absolutely no filler. Called &quot;the original heavy metal album&quot; in the liner notes, every track has Ritchie Blackmore's great riffs, Jon Lord's haunting keyboards and Ian Gillian's snarling vocals. But to call it &quot;heavy metal&quot; is a bit of a disservice to those who may think of the genre as undecipherable, talent-depleted noise. Here the members, all veterans of the British rock scene blend their talents beautifully in a no-nonsense style that defied the glam rock so popular out of Britain at the time. The lyrics express fantasy, loss and lonliness, and simpler themes like car ownership. Best tracks are &quot;Pictures of Home&quot; (&quot;I'm alone here, with emptiness, eagles and snow, unfriendliness chilling my body...&quot;) and &quot;Lazy&quot;, with the great keyboard into and uptempo beat. &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; will be a classic rock anthem until all us Baby Boomers are back in diapers and &quot;Highway Star&quot;, despite the silly lyrics, will get you up to 75 or more if you're on the Interstate. One of the albums I actually once owned an 8-Track of, it sounds as good today as it did back in the early '70s.
B00003CXR0|5.0|I enjoyed the movie to full enjoyment.  I have always been a big Leslie Caron fan so being able to see her on the big screen has always been a dream that has now been fulfilled!!!  Considering Leslie wasn't in a large part of the film I came to love the acting and beauty of the lead character Juliette Binoche!   She was wonderful in it.   She should have won that oscar.   What were those people thinking???     Well if I ever see her name anywhere again I'll be in the front row to see her again in her next oscar nominating or (hopefully) winning roll.  I know she has it in her.  Well I enjoyed the movie tremendously and recommend it to anyone of any age.  I love this movie to death!!!!
B000001C6M|3.0|Slayer's 1983 debut can be viewed as a sort of baby Reign in Blood. It features all of the hallmarks of the Slayer sound - like mind-boggling speed, harsh and wild guitar solos and all-out aggression - but in a primitive sort of way. For the most part, the songs aren't quite as well-written or constructed as on their later work, and the production is a little sub-par. However, there is enough cool stuff here (such as 'Die by the Sword' and the title track) that hardcore thrash fans should check it out.
B00005B6C9|5.0|First, the thing that struck me first about this album is that the Bee Gees, after 3 1/2 decades of recording original material, still seem to have the enthusiasm of a group making its first record.  They also have more than their share of talent in this area.<br />The balance I referred to earlier has to do with the different periods in their career.  The Brothers' Disco Period material (which I will say quite candidly I still listen to and enjoy) bore little resemblance to their earlier work.  Likewise, the material from 1987's ESP to STILL WATERS in 1997 seemed another departure.  There were great songs always, but it seemed like at 2 different points in their career, the Bee Gees had (successfully) reinvented themselves.  With this record, all of the periods come together and blend beautifully in glorious new material.<br />The title song is my personal favorite, although a few other tracks in this collection give it some pretty fierce competition.  I could go on, but suffice it to say that this album does not disappoint.<br />Something I have noticed in a few of the other reviews is that there is something lacking in Barry's voice.  Of course, that is subjective, but I have listened and re-listened and, for the life of me, can't find anything lacking in his singing as compared with earlier recordings.  <br />The only complaint I have is that it has been four years since their last release.  But it was worth the wait.  Enjoy!
078401115X|4.0|Full of atmosphere, style, and topped with a genuinely surprising ending, &quot;Angel Heart&quot; can be said with certainty to be one of the most underrated films of the past 20 years.  Perhaps it was the combination of Mickey Rourke and Alan Parket, two Hollywood outsiders (at best) or the controversy over the no-holds-barred sex scene between Rourke and Lisa Bonet...but there is real style and smarts under the surface of this one, not to mention some great imagery and a jazz soundtrack.  As steamy as summer in New Orleans, the influence of &quot;Angel Heart&quot; can be seen in movies as diverse and popular as &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Seven.&quot;
B00004X0Q0|4.0|A fresh new (old) look at rock. An awesome compilation of sounds and words. Its raw and new and loud and origional. I love it
B00000AFGM|5.0|... but extremely good rock. I don't own Manson's other albums, although I've heard a few songs from them. This is definatly a radical departure from any of his other stuff, though, and is way better than anything else by Manson I've heard so far. Standouts are &quot;Fundamentally Loathsome,&quot; &quot;The Speed of Pain,&quot; and the title track, though it's all outstanding. The only times the music even begins to deteriorate are &quot;The Dope Show,&quot; and parts of &quot;User Friendly.&quot; Overall, this shows great versitilty musically. On what other CD can you find old school metal (&quot;I Want to Disappear&quot;), southern rock (&quot;I Don't Like the Drugs&quot;), techno (&quot;New Model 15&quot;), and glam rock (&quot;Great Big White World&quot;)? The answer is that no other CD can contain all these styles. If you want something different from the norm, get this great album. If you want some boring metal that isn't at all progressive, get any Korn CD. It's your choice, but I would choose &quot;Mechanical Animals.&quot;
B00005AXEL|2.0|While the songwriting's not inspired, imaginitive production could have made the songs more compelling and the whole recording more listenable. Instead, Sheryl Crow manages to make just about every song sound like the other, which only contributes to the ennui.<br />Unfortunately, only one track, &quot;Everyday&quot;, stands out, and it's not even written by Nicks.<br />I was hoping for a recording as moving and stirring, if not as passionate, as Buckingham/Nicks, but this doesn't come close. Perhaps the pair should collaborate again; the murky dam water may provide the fertile medium for creativity that was evidently missing when this was recorded.<br />I heard Stevie comment that this record took a &quot;long time&quot; to make. Maybe that's at the root of its problems.
B00000K0EA|2.0|Don't get me wrong.  I think Pierce Brosnan is still the 2nd best Bond ever--no one replaces Sean Connery, naturally, but Brosnan does a pretty good job.<br />However, I take issue with the story here.  It's what I like to call \\"Cookbook Bond\\" with every lack of originality of stories associated with Roger Moore, et al.  Oh, another nuclear weapon?  Surprise...I'm not sure, but MAYBE THIS HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE!!<br />And that's not everything.  Our villain is hardly menacing to say the least.  \\"There's no news like bad news.\\"  Was that meant to sound evil or effeminate?  It's hard to tell, because the line was delivered so badly.<br />I was so disappointed in Jonathan Pryce, a fine actor whose talent really shines in movies like Brazil, but is really wasted here as the \\"media mogul\\" whose mission in life is to make headlines.  All rightie...let's waste a few million people (potential) customers to basically hold on to a few more customers that we may glean from this ridiculous venture of mass murder. <br />Whatever.<br />I'm thankful that Bond is still alive, but get original PLEASE!!  At least Goldeneye had the semblance of originality...financial chaos caused by an EMP strike was interesting to say the least.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Great combination of rock and hip-hop. Reasonable aggression in Nookie, the best track on the CD and Break Stuff. There's a sense of boredom in Re-Arranged but it's good to listen to for a bored mind. Nobody Like You has an excellent blend of the vocals by Fred Durst and Jonathan Davis of Korn. N 2Gether Now shows some of the rapping skills of Fred Durst and Wu-Tang's Method Man. Pretty impressive beat between a rocker and a rapper. One star for the guitar sound of Wes Borland, One star for impressive percussion by John Otto, One star for great sound by DJ Lethal and one star for vocals. Minus one star for their current success rate now. This album was released in 1999 and their latest, the 2000 Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water got some bad reviews. Particularly with the song Hot Dog which uses [a certain four letter] word 43 times for no reason. If Limp Bizkit uses the skills from Significant Other, they can make another better album and have a good shot at qualifying for the Grammys.
B00005AFVR|4.0|Love Bruce Springstein and everything he has recorded.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers has some of the coolest songs such as the depressed &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; and &quot;Other Side&quot;. There are also some songs with some great sound such as &quot;Around the World&quot;  and &quot;Parallel Universe&quot;. There are other great songs with cunning beats such as &quot;Get on Top&quot; and &quot;Easily&quot;. Lyrics make sense and almost every song is enjoyable. One star for vocals, one for well written lyrics, one for guitar quality, one for great percussion beat, and one for one great combination to make a good sound. There is no good reason to rate Red Hot Chili Peppers with one star. I wonder those who underate RHCP have even listened to their music and did analysis on every song. GREAT CD TO ADD TO YOUR ALTERNITIVE COLLECTION!
0451160916|5.0|I have read the book and watched the movie.  I love them both.  It wasn't until a few years ago that I found out the truth behind the story.  In the story it talkes about the Overlook Hotel.  The true story is not about a hotel names The Overlook.  It is about The Mt. Washington Hotel.  I live about 30minuets from that hotel. Infact this year I went to my senior prom there. Knowing the story it was neat going there.  I suggest to anyone that likes the book and will be travleing to New Hampshire go up to The Mt. Washington Hotel and take a look around. The area is beautiful and you get an eire feeling walking down the long hallway and going into the gold room.

Now, you can watch this video several times each day and you can see me being beautiful, and hear me being beautiful.  Buy this video now.  You will then understand true beauty and your pitiful life will have meaning.
0684830485|5.0|What more is there to say about this masterpiece that hasn't been covered in over 100 reviews here, not to mention the  shelves of critical essays and examinations since this book appeared in 1940?<br />Precious little, probably, yet what a strange \\"Great American Novel\\" this is! To begin with its set in Spain, in the midst of an  all but forgotten conflict, the Spanish Civil War. Then there's our hero, a young university lecturer Robert Jordan, linguist and  fluent in Spanish, French, and probably German. <br />Jordan is one of the most likable people in American literature, in many ways the all-American hero. Yet he's fighting for the  communists...under a Russian general, with a guerilla (terrorist?) group that seems distinctly low on  ideals, and high on banditry and brutality.<br />Then there's the novel's philosophy, which the title implicitly states, which supports the notion of community, and  co-operation, and the importance of individual sacrifice for the common good. Foreign and un-American indeed, yet  brilliantly handled - even a Fascist Officer becomes someone we can sympathise with (and is probably Robert Jordan's last  victim).<br />A curious feature is the pervasive irony, so absent from much current American writing and conversation. Its manifest in  many episodes, and provides much sly humour, such as when Robert Jordan speaks of machine guns jamming or running out  of ammunition but does so in English. When his Spanish comrades ask him what he's talking about, he simply replies \\"just  looking into the future in English.\\"<br />Hemingway's main innovation is a simple yet brilliant: Render the Spanish dialogue in English, but make it a simi-literal  translation; so for instance \\"What's your name?\\" becomes \\"How are you called?\\" Its a little awkward for the first few pages,  then we adjust, but never forget that Robert Jordan is speaking Spanish to Spanish speakers.<br />Good novelists write books with strong main characters, great ones make even theminor characters memorable. And  so it is with this book, from the uneducated yet thoughtful old man Anselmo, to the half deaf leader of a neighboring guerilla band, El Sordo. <br />Finally, in an era of up-beat feelings and the importance of positive thinking, For Whom the Bell Tolls is an extraordinarily pessimistic and downbeat novel...<br />Truly an American classic, maybe the strangest of them all.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is simply the best example of The Beatles creative ability that can be found. When I was buying this album I was uncertain whether to get this, The Blue Album, or perhaps Abbey Road. I can now safely say I made the right choice. This album includes everything from the humourous (Ob La Di Ob La Da, Piggies) to the emotional (Julia, While My Guitar Gently Weeps) to the just plain weird (Wild Honey Pie, Revelution 9). To anyone who is uncertain about what to choose all I can say is THIS!!!!
B00003CXP1|5.0|I'm going to make this review extremely short because I don't have much to say about this film other than the fact that it is one of the most incredibly brilliant films I have seen this year. It is an absolutely amazing thrill ride, with the most unique directing style I have ever seen. The film moves along at a lightening scene, quickly shifting scenes, so a great deal of attention must be paid...the performances were outstanding and extremely believable, Ellen Burstyn should have recieved that Oscar, she was unbelievable....this film is definitely recommended, but please be warned that it is extremely painful to watch and I had to turn my eyes away for a couple of scenes...this is powerful stuff unlike anything I have ever seen before...<br />you know a movie is great when it stays in your mind long after...this is one of the movies to do that...so very disturbing and emotionally powerful...this is not a fun movie, but an important one...
0780631153|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it, but I knew there was something more to it. The way the director pulls you into each of the nine characters is amazing, and the climax was hilarious, awesome, and disgusting at the same time.  I love dramatic movies like this, but the day after I saw it I couldn't stop thinking about it, and I knew there had to more to this movie than meets the eye.  Then I watched it again, and I noticed that one of the audience members on the set of &quot;What Do Kids Know?&quot; holds a sign that reads &quot;Exodus 8:2&quot; and the quote refers to one of the great plagues from the Bible, where God threatens a plague of frogs if His will is not fulfilled.  Interesting?  Well, the nine characters also symbolize all types of sin in every walk of life, and therefore God's reaction to their sin was a downpour of frogs.   There is also some symbolic play with the colors used.  There are many blues-the uniform of the nurse, the backdrop of the gameshow, the clothes of the new quiz kid, there are reds-Donnie the Quiz Kid's glasses and the scarf he wears when he is robbing the store, and browns-the shirt that Frank Mackey wears, and the outfit that his interviewer wears.  Also, I think that the green of the frogs may symbolize envy and jealousy.  These colors correspond to the different sins and struggles that are going on.  I'm not sure exactly how they correspond, but there is a connection.  If you have any insights into this I would love to hear them!  I absolutely love this movie, and keep learning more and more about it every time I see it, which is only two times.  And if you missed some of these things, try watching it again, and maybe you'll see something deeper.
B000003BF4|5.0|The Rolling Stones captured live (or not according to our Norwegian buddy out there) at the point in their long career when they were feeling invincible and anxious to prove their self-proclaimed &quot;greatest&quot; title was well deserved. As such, it is unique of all of their live efforts because of that very urgency and hunger coupled with the supreme confidence and drive of their two unchallenged (Brian R.I.P.) leaders Mick and Keith. I can't underemphasize the personality of the band at this point because it is precisely what fueled this unforgettable tour and the thrilling and fiery set this recording contains. If you close your eyes and sit square between the speakers, you can feel the emotional current flowing through the band into the audience and back as the band races towards the finale during &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; or dangles the audience over the chasm of danger and fear during &quot;Midnight Rambler.&quot; For extra visual support, check out the movie &quot;Gimmie Shelter&quot; but have a remote in hand to fast forward through the dull meetings and lawyer b.s. to the live stuff and the even rarer studio sessions for &quot;Sticky Fingers.&quot; Before the band became the jaded millionaires of the 70s on up through today and even before the tour's tragic ending at Altamont which forever changed it's members, The Rolling Stones were just another rock and roll band out to take over the world. On this tour, they may have earned their title at the cost of their innocence and their own sense of invincibility. For a complete look at a fascinating and musically superb period of rock and roll, forget the groovy sixties at Woodstock and all of that short-lived pipe dream, and get instead the Stanley Booth book which documents the tour, this recording, and &quot;Gimmie Shelter&quot; and take a weekend to relive history.
0062502182|5.0|This book is simply first rate. Excellent. Author says he wrote it in 15 days. It was pure inspiration. Same as he wrote it you read it: it flows easily.

Si ests buscando algo y no quieres renunciar a tus ilusiones: este es tu libro.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is by far the best work we have yet been graced with by the Queen of Rock! It was well worth the wait. She has come back full force with this album and everyone must have this. ROCK ON GOLD DUST WOMAN YOU HAVE DONE IT YET AGAIN! WE LOVE YOU.
B00003ETJQ|5.0|I'm sure you read the editorial review for this product, so I will keep my comments short.  I personally enjoy the IMAX dvd's but, I'm glad I picked this one up.  It's one of the most stunning things I've seen in quite awhile.  This is probably the closest you will ever get to visual art on a dvd.  And to top it all off, the soundtrack helps to completely immerse you within it.  I believe this was released over 8 years ago, but it is a timeless work- it could have been done yesterday, and I'd be none the wiser.      One thing about the editorial review I'd like to point out- it is a little frustrating not knowing where you are sometimes during the DVD- it even comes with a little insert that shows the world, and all the areas where filming took place- if it really doesn't matter where they are, then I wish that they did not include that- because it does become irksome trying to match up the places that they list, with what you were watching.   So don't bother with that =) crank up the surround sound, turn off the lights, and enjoy<br />&gt;o'
B00005J6UP|5.0|Steven Spielberg is the great. He made a beautifull film about child's dreams and made all generation of young people ( 80's ) believe in dreams. A very good story of Pirates and adventure whith the most incredible act of young stars like Corey Feldman , Jeff Cohen , Sean Astin , Josh Brolin , etc... My generation is expecting the release of the DVD edition for a long time...so...our dreams come true.Thanks Steven and all the Goonies Team !!! Pedro Leito Viva Portugal!
B000059HAI|4.0|When I saw this movie out on DVD, I grabbed it right away- especially with all the hoopla surrounding the opening of Pearl Harbor.  Although I've seen this movie several times on television, it's been quite awhile since my last viewing.       What has always amazed me with this movie, is the fairness and historical accuracy used in its creation.  The movie's beginning says it has attempted to be historically accurate- which I agree with.  I realize there's a great many people out there who believe FDR &quot;knew&quot; the attack was coming, but I for one, agree with the movie in showing that he did not.      The movie is very good at showing the chaos going on in military Japan, and without going into excruciating detail, depicts the upheavel and in-house fighting going on within the country.      Besides the accuracy, I really like the action scences- the flights of planes, and the ships in the harbor do not look like little toy models or anything along those lines.  Very well done, put together movie, and I recommend it for anyone who has an increased awareness about the battle.<br />&gt;o'
0062502182|5.0|I read this book at 17 after a friend recommended it, and its principles have been with me ever since. It's a great adventure story for both adults and children. The book is about a boy sheperd who follows his dreams. He follows omens and so forth to find his way.
1878424319|1.0|As several others have written, the concept of the four agreements is sound, simple, and inherrently obvious to anyone who pays attention to the interactions with people in his/her own life.  To take such and imbue it with wystical significance and market that &quot;insight&quot; for personal gain is intellectually and ethically reprehensible.  I recommend, rather than buying this book, that the would be reader just walk about in his/her community and talk to people, learn to listen, and apply what he/she learns from this to the living of his/her own life.  The four agreements are sound; the book is exploitation.
B000000WHX|5.0|Massive Attacks first album is one that has as much meaning, intrigue and depth now, that it did 10 years ago. Its amazing to think that they compiled such an audaciously new and different sound so long ago. They have since added to their deserved reputation with Protection and Mezzanine (both awesome).<br />This album is full of different sounds, samples and oozes with cool. The inclusion of Shara Nelson and Tricky adds to its overall completeness.<br />This albums is steeped in 70's funk influence and dubby reggae sound, with the bass line of &quot;Safe From Harm&quot; coming from a 70's track called Stratus and &quot;Be Thankful For What You Got&quot; is an orginal 70's funk song in its entirety.<br />Each song/track on this album is in its correct place as the album flows smoothly, and sometimes without respite (&quot;Blue Lines&quot; into &quot;Be Thankful For What You Got&quot;) allowing the total absorption of ones mind and body into the rich dub bass, hip hop rhymes and seductive sound.<br />&quot;Unfinished Symphony&quot; is simply a breathtaking journey of a song that chews you up and spits you out with blissful elegance and grace.  While the &quot;Hymn Of The Big Wheel&quot; lyrically glides you to the end of the album and off your chair with your placated mind begging for more.<br />Its obvious that Massive Attack make a great team with their sound and individual input making this album the modern classic that it is. It deserves all the credit it gets; a must buy! Lets hope we dont have to wait too much longer for another masterpiece from the Bristol Massive!
B00000K19E|4.0|I know my review is a bit late in coming, but for those that have either not seen the movie or have yet to purchase the DVD, let me tell you why you should do both.<br />First of all, the movie is an exceptional feat of special effects, and boasts the most incredible and mesmerizing action sequence I have ever seen in any movie (starting with the infamous lobby scene, which is cool, if not vital to the plot). For the special effects alone you should see this movie. If you are a science fiction fan, the subtle nuances will appeal to you. The film has been passed off as a mere action packed, shoot-'em-up flick, but if you look closely, there are actually a lot of references to religion, nihilism, and the Bible. Another thing that sets this movie apart from others in the science-fiction genre is its unusual premise that we are all living in a dream world controlled by sentient machines. This provides for some thought-provoking conversations between Morpheus and Neo.<br />Now I must warn those who haven't seen the movie that the action you expect doesn't come until almost half of the film has passed, but when it does, it is well worth the wait. The first 45 minutes of the movie familiarizes the audience with the Matrix and introduces the main characters, and there are a couple of strange scenes that will weird out some people (or both).<br />The only reason I did not award this movie 5 stars is because the characters were not developed nearly as much as they could have been. You don't find yourself caring for them as much as you find yourself watching their motions on the screen. After all, it's only a movie, right? But it could have been better if the characters had pulled you further into the dense plot.<br />As for the DVD, I highly recommend it to any DVD collector. The transitions between menus are fantastic and look good, and there are so many special features that it took me no less than an hour to look at them all.
0385501560|5.0|In literature today, Chuck Palahniuk is the man of the moment.  With the possible exception of &quot;Glorious Failure&quot; by Ben Jonjak, Palahniuk's works have established themselves as the voice of the era.  With the controversial &quot;Fight Club&quot; Palahniuk muscled his way into the spotlight and gave his readers an uncompromising look at the flaws in our sometimes over-glorified culture.  Now with the no less controversial &quot;Choke&quot; Palahniuk continues to deliver.<br />&quot;Choke&quot; is an exploration of sexual deviancy, but the main theme of the novel, like &quot;Fight Club,&quot; is the modern-day angst caused from the apparent purposelessness of our watered-down, machine assisted lifestyle.  There is a certain desperation that can be felt behind the novel's sometimes witty, sometimes grotesque, always compelling escapades.  More so than in any of his other novels, you can hear Palahniuk's own uncertainty behind the false bravado of his unfortunate characters.  Essentially, &quot;Choke&quot; is a discussion on what is most important in life and a plea for some guidance as to how to achieve it.  But by presenting this argument through a series of ill-conceived misadventures, the discussion is rendered light and compelling.  <br />Palahniuk writes with a short, terse style that is always compared to Vonnegut but which also reminds me of Hemmingway.  He tries to write as people speak, and the often grammatically garbled, yet perfectly understandable sentences that result are given a very spontaneous feel as a consequence.  The novel is obviously well conceived and well polished, but it is not tediously overworked, as most novels that try to sound literary tend to be.  Although I would hesitate to call Palahniuk's style new, he does add a dimension to this sort of &quot;free&quot; writing that I haven't seen before and which is very refreshing.<br />&quot;Choke&quot; is a marvelous novel.  If you have any interest in being on the cutting edge of where literature is going, this is the book you must read.  Although many of &quot;Choke's&quot; themes are very similar to the ones found in Palahniuk's previous books, &quot;Choke&quot; provides them with a more personal touch.  Palahniuk has matured, and perhaps grown more confident as a writer; he is bringing his readers further and further into his confidence and I am very excited to see what he comes up with next.
B00003CX95|5.0|There isn't enough space here to tell you what I love about this movie, but maybe I can convince you that it is definitely worth seeing.<br />For those unfamiliar with the plot, Scottish commoner William Wallace finds himself in love with a childhood friend, and secretly weds her. The English come along and kill her, and Wallace exacts his revenge, resulting in a Scottish rebellion against oppressive English rule.<br />Wallace, played impeccably by Mel Gibson, leads the rebellion, inspiring the Scottish peasants that make up the ranks of his army with the promise of freedom. In a particularly wonderful speech that is classic among Braveheart fans, Gibson extolls the virtue of freedom and rouses his army to fight a much larger English army.<br />There are three things that make this movie so good. First, the characters are convincing and well played (Patrick McGoohan plays the conniving King Edward so well you can't imagine him as anyone else), and you grow to like them. Second, the romantic subplots are a vital and seamless part of the plot, and are never cheesy or unbelievable. Thirdly, the message of the film is one for the ages. Freedom from oppression is something everyone can identify with, and it provides for a very emotional ending and pulls you into the movie.<br />Though the film does an immeasurably good job of bringing you into the past with its sweeping cinematography and its epic plot, some of the battle scenes might be too much for some people to take, particularly younger audiences. The violence is never overboard, but it is enough to convey the brutality of medieval warfare.<br />Other than that, a must see!

Now with the no less controversial &quot;Choke&quot; Palahniuk continues to deliver.<br />&quot;Choke&quot; is an exploration of sexual deviancy, but the main theme of the novel, like &quot;Fight Club,&quot; is the modern-day angst caused from the apparent purposelessness of our watered-down, machine assisted lifestyle.  There is a certain desperation that can be felt behind the novel's sometimes witty, sometimes grotesque, always compelling escapades.  More so than in any of his other novels, you can hear Palahniuk's own uncertainty behind the false bravado of his unfortunate characters.  Essentially, &quot;Choke&quot; is a discussion on what is most important in life and a plea for some guidance as to how to achieve it.  But by presenting this argument through a series of ill-conceived misadventures, the discussion is rendered light and compelling.  <br />Palahniuk writes with a short, terse style that is always compared to Vonnegut but which also reminds me of Hemmingway.  He tries to write as people speak, and the often grammatically garbled, yet perfectly understandable sentences that result are given a very spontaneous feel as a consequence.  The novel is obviously well conceived and well polished, but it is not tediously overworked, as most novels that try to sound literary tend to be.  Although I would hesitate to call Palahniuk's style new, he does add a dimension to this sort of &quot;free&quot; writing that I haven't seen before and which is very refreshing.<br />&quot;Choke&quot; is a marvelous novel.  If you have any interest in being on the cutting edge of where literatureis going, this is the book you must read.  Although many of &quot;Choke's&quot; themes are very similar to the ones found in Palahniuk's previous books, &quot;Choke&quot; provides them with a more personal touch.  Palahniuk has matured, and perhaps grown more confident as a writer; he is bringing his readers further and further into his confidence and I am very excited to see what he comes up with next.
B00004R99L|5.0|This is a brilliant movie. I first saw it when I was a kid and and it has been my favourite movie ever since. It has everything, adventure, comedy, magic and music. It takes you into a wonderful dreamland where everything is surreal and a wonderful escapism from life. I would recommend it to adults and children alike.
0452282152|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  As I initially read the reviews I was skeptical, but the title kept coming up on the list of books I might enjoy.  They were right.  The title character tells the story from her point of view and you can't help but be captivated by her story.
0553284347|5.0|I am impressed beyond words at this book.  Not only did it validate my feelings that things done to me by my parents were abusive, but it is helping me to get on with my life and break the hold they have over me.  Very easy to understand and well written.  The author talks in a straightforward manner, but also with a gentleness and understanding that adults in this situation need!  I recommend this book to anyone who has suffered childhood abuse of all kinds, and who wants to heal those old wounds.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Finally, this film is given the treatment it has been denied for years.  No longer imprisoned in a frustrating pan-and-scan format, &quot;Superman&quot; comes to life in this gorgeous widescreen transfer. There are tons of great special features as well, particularly the numerous screen tests with multiple actresses for the part of Lois Lane (Stockard Channing????!!!!). If you grew up in love with this film as I did, you owe it to yourself to add this DVD to your collection.
B00005JH7D|4.0|From 'Power' to 'Your Amazing Grace', Marcus is putting it all on display for the music listener to enjoy. Though not as personal as 'Tales', it is still nontheless as fiery and passionate. 'Lonnies Lament' and 'Nikkis Groove' are my personal faves, and Herbie Handcock's piano work on 'Goodbye Pork Pie Hat' is simply delicious. The string and horn arrangements add  a breath of fresh air to the funk-hip/hop rhythms. But I wish he had used his Sadowsky 5 string fretted on this disc(see 'Ethopia' and 'Eric' on the Tales CD); I thought it added another dimension to his sound. Anyway, this is still a very enjoyable record. Being a fan since the early David Sandborn/Luther Vandross days, I'm getting a little miffed by all these bandwagon cats biting M.M.s chops and style; but I guess these days imitation, not originality and talent, is how you make a name for yourself(See New Kids on the Block and BackStreet Boys for details). Highly recommended for fans of funk/jazz.
B00003CXE7|2.0|I have read articles where it is mentioned that Director Scott first wanted Mel Gibson as Maximus, but Mr. Gibson, feeling his years a bit, replied that he was to old and recommended Crowe as the best person for the job. So Mr. Scott lost Mad Max, But stole so many plot and scene ideas from Gibsons 'Braveheart', that if Gibson had appeared, this Hollywood pap festival might have been considered a sequel.       How Crowe snared the best actor award for his gutteral, mono-syllabic General/Slave/Gladiator is beyond me. The myriad computer effects are so poorly done, that almost all the generated landscapes look like a childs water color. The fast/slow motion moments, the the realing camera work, all make for virtual indigestion. Crowe, after being enslaved, becomes even more reticent, and is the least impressive physically of all the would be Gladiators. Joaquin Phoenix plays the new Cesar on the Pax Romana block, and plays it very poorly. Scott seemed to want him to come off as a wicked, evil, back stabbing, incestious dog. Instead Phoenix is more a sniveling, cringing annoyance than a mad tyrant. The plot ,which is hackenyed and thin, is also incongrously slow. I think Rome was Built and conquered in less time then it takes for this dud to complete.    Save your money, time and patience, because this movie isnt worth any of those.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|Soundtracks in general have been getting better in recent years.  I like this soundtrack, although do not love it.  Biggest surprise is Nicole Kidman singing 'One Day I'll Fly Away' which is co capturing.  Ewan singing 'Your Song' is a nice rendition of Elton's masterpiece.   Like all soundtracks, there are a couple of fillers which didnt need to be included (particularly when there were other songs from the movie they could have used), but  a perfect CD doesnt exist in this world. Worth owning for the tributes alone.
0684874350|5.0|Who would have thunk that a memoir written in the voice of a 10-year-old Irish lad would win the Pulitzer Prize? <br />Well, it did and the recognition was well-deserved. <br />Yes, it's about desperate poverty, alcoholism, consumption, death, you name it - just one damnable thing after the other that confronts Frankie McCourt, his brothers Malachy and Alphie, and mother Angela. <br />But the beauty of this book is its voice, the voice of the very young and very Irish Frank McCourt. It sings, it dances, it laughs at fear and despair, it's a melody of innocence in the midst of a purgatory-on-earth. <br />Angela's Ashes is timeless, a treasure that is sure to stake its claim as a classic.
B000002LIX|5.0|The only other record that competes with this one for that title is Radiohead's OK Computer - at least in my opinion.  I really think it's a shame that Janes self-destructed so quickly.  When I listen to &quot;Three Days&quot; &amp; &quot;Then She Did&quot; I often wonder what they would have created had they stayed together.  You know, I just saw them play at the Santa Barbara Bowl on April 26,2001 and they were amazing.  In fact, that was the seond time I have seen them since they &quot;broke&quot; up.  Perhaps, with Martyn LeNoble handling the bass duties, they will record again.  Regardless of my ponderings, this record stands as their last testament and - at least to me - ranks right up there with anything the Beatles, Pink Floyd &amp; Led Zeppelin ever did.  No cd collection is complete without this one.
B00004YKUX|4.0|on this album cash interprets other people's songs from an amazingly wide spectrum of sources. to quite incredible effect. you've probably heard many of the original artists' recordings, but have you LISTENED to them? because that's what cash somehow forces you to do. for the first time, you will truly appreciate the lyrical mastery of u2's 'one.' cash sings it like he wrote it. tom petty's 'won't back down' has always irritated the hell out of me - but in cash's hands it's an american classic. i hadn't heard all the songs before, but i can only imagine that all the artists who got the cash treatment on this album are feeling mighty proud right now.
0618135871|1.0|I felt the novel to be boring, a simple rehash of Mr. Roth's earlier work, and sloppily written at that.  This is too bad, for Roth, at his best, is nothing less than a genius: his novella THE BENNY PODA YEARS was, for me, his finest work since SHYLOCK.  But the present novel fails to achieve Roth's previous level of innovation.
014028009X|2.0|This book annoyed me in that Bridget never changes.  I had hopes in the beginning that she would somehow overcome her insecurities and neuroses, and so I endured her uninteresting obsessions.  But in the end I felt duped by her constancy.  She is a little kid whining for candy, only in the end to get her candy and undoubtedly begin whining for something else.  Perhaps it is a true picture of the gen-x-er, but I live it so I don't need to read it in my free time.
B00003CXN3|5.0|I did't know what to expect when I decided to pick this up in the video store. But anything that was up for four oscars and had Don Cheadle in the cast, I figured I couldn't go wrong --- I didn't. I thought Michael Douglas was a little too Michael Douglas but the rest of the cast was excellent. I loved how the scenery was shot and how the story unfolded. I rented two movies today (this one and Dungeons and Dragons) and I experienced one of those all too rare moments where both choices were excellent.<br />I haven't felt this strong about a good film since Pitch Black...
B000059HAI|5.0|If you want a very well done and historically accurate version of Pearl Harbor, forget that new Affleck movie, and get this!  The entire background of the attack on pearl harbor is given, with Japanese actors, and scenes from the Japanese ships, planes, and in Japan, as well as a thourough background of the situation in the USA.  Another bonus is the fact that since there was no CGI available in 1970, they had to use REAL PLANES for most of the shots, and since the movie is so well done, the few scenes were miniatures were used can be forgiven.  Even after 30 years this a solid movie, on par with 'PATTON'.

6305622930|5.0|&quot;Patton&quot; offers one of the great marriages of actor and role with George C. Scott's riveting portrayal of the notorious American tank commander.  As a film biography &quot;Patton&quot; forgoes the rise of the celebrated general and merely hints at his ironic death because of injuries suffered in a traffic accident, focuses entirely on his military career commanding troops in North Africa, Sicily and France during World War II.  The strength of the script by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, as well as of Scott's performance, is that the paradoxes of Patton are completely embraced.  Not even Patton's loyal cadre of staff officers can keep him from shooting off his mouth every time there are reporters around, but then neither German Field Marshall Rommel or English Field Marshall Montgomery can beat him on the battlefield.  Karl Malden's performance as General Omar Bradley is just as solid as Scott's, presenting a man whose personality is the complete antithesis of Patton.  Viewers find themselves identifying with the German captain who is the intelligence expert on Patton and arguably the only person in the film who really understands or respects the American general.  But the more I watch &quot;Patton,&quot; the more I am very impressed with the battle sequences of director Franklin J. Schaffner (&quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; &quot;Pappillon&quot;), which were staged live and full-scale without special effects of miniatures.  Schaffner provides not just the large spectacle of a desert tank battle, but smaller and equally memorable moments, such as a soldier falling dead in the snow.  &quot;Patton&quot; deserved its Oscars.<br />In terms of extra features on this DVD, the second disc features the 1997 50-minute retrospective documentary, &quot;The Making of Patton: A Tribute to Franklin J. Schaffner.&quot;  Recent interviews with the cinematographer, composer, etc., are blended with audio interviews of Schaffner and Scott from 1970, newsreel footage of Patton, along with clips and publicity stills from the film make a fitting tribute to the late director.  The audio commentary on the first disc is really more of a lecture on Patton by Charles M. Province, the author of the book &quot;The Unknown Patton&quot; and founder/president of the General George S. Patton, Jr. Historical Society.  Province more than adequately fills in what the movie leaves out about Patton's life.  On the second disc Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar nominated musical score is presented in stereo, including alternate takes and a series of radio spots.  You certainly have to appreciate what Fox has put together here: This is a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD priced as a regular DVD, a real treat for those of us who remember being mesmerized by George C.

0811826848|5.0|I never really followed The Beatles until a few years ago.  I was familiar with some of their songs such as Hey Jude, Come Together, Let it Be, and others I sometimes heard on the radio.<br />This book did a great job of literally educating me about the greatest band in history.  The amount of content is incredible, literally making it an encyclopedia written by the heroes themselves.
0553278223|4.0|This was more than just a science fiction novel, it was a philosophical analysis of life- here on Earth and beyond.  It makes you think more than anything.

B000059XUO|5.0|I have to say, waiting out what I felt would be the inevitable collectors edition of the Crow was nearly impossible. Every week I would look at it sitting on the shelf and I would pick it up, look at the price tag and the lack of features and I would put it back on the shelf, longing for it but knowing that eventually a collectors edition would be produced. Months ago, when I first heard about this two disk collectors edition I felt vindicated in my decision to not purchase the pitiful DVD Dimension had originally put on the market. My love of this film goes back to before it was produced, I was one of those lucky enough to have read the original Crow comic book series by James O&#8217;Barr and I knew then it would adapt to the big screen pretty easily with the right direction. After seeing the movie the first time I knew that it was only a matter of time before the sequel as it was, in my eyes, the single best comic book adaptation I had ever seen.<br />The main story is a rather simple one; a young couple on the eve of their marriage gets murdered in their home and a year later, the husband to be raises up from the grave to avenge not his murder, but the murder of his love. The movie, much like the comic, takes us on a ride of violence and retribution as he punishes those who destroyed him. His vengeance is brutal and warranted as you see these men continuing their path of destruction as they prepare for &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Night&#8221;, the eve of Halloween where the legions of drug dealers and killers light fire to Detroit and pillage the ruins. The man who&#8217;s lives he seeks; Fun Boy, T Bird, Tin Tin and Skank are all in the employ of the cheesily named Top Dollar. Fortunately the seemingly problematic name didn&#8217;t seen to deter the drug snorting gangster as he basically runs the city with his sister at his side. <br />Amidst all the blood and violence there is an underlying theme of romantic intentions as Draven is doing these things to take revengefor the death of his love. Over the course of his vigilante type killings, the thought that he may be doing good isn&#8217;t a factor, so while he seems noble in what he does, it&#8217;s all done out of anger and hate. A sympathetic hero, yes, a noble dogooder, no.<br />The music adds an incredible level of ambiance to the film with such industrial/metal/alternative sounds as Nine Inch Nails, My Life With The Thrill Kill Cult, Stone Temple Pilots, the Cure and many other incredible talents who helped make the Crow one of the best soundtracks of any film ever. This may sound odd but without the music, I don&#8217;t think the movie would have been able to capture the feel of the comic quite as well.<br />filmspies.com

B00005ASHM|5.0|This album took me a few listens to really appreciate. Being a bit of a purist, I listened to the mono tracks in an effort to experience the music in its original form. Although I felt it was a fine album I was initially underwhelmed. Within a few minutes of my first listening however, I was drawn back for a second listen. Setting my CD player for the remastered stereo tracks and strapping on a set of good quality headphones I settled in for the 33+ minutes that the record covers and was simply blown away...<br />The remastered tracks are bright and textured and and the lyrics are heartwarming and at times even heartbreaking. This album will get under your skin and stay there even after repeated listenings. Give this record a listen with an open mind and you may have the same reaction that I did...<br />Namely why didn't I hear about this fantastic piece sooner?
1572702095|5.0|When &lt;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&gt; appeared in 1926, it was Agatha Christie's sixth novel under her real name and the third to feature Hercule Poirot, not counting a collection of short stories about the Belgian sleuth. It also caused a storm of controversy at the Detection Club, of which she was a member, because she broke one of their prime rules of detective fiction writing. (The trouble is, I cannot tell you what rule that was without ruining the solution for you.) But even if you disregard the twist at the end, you still have a thumping good murder yarn that concentrates very closely on Poirot's methods of ignoring nothing and--how I wish many of us were like this--refusing to twist the facts to fit his theories.<br />  This novel benefits further from the supremely comic (and believable) character of Caroline Sheppard, the narrator's sister. (This book is in the form of a journal kept like those of Dr. Watson by a participant in the events and therefore is in the first person. This gives Christie the right to keep Poirot's thoughts unknown to us until they are revealed to the center of consciousness.)  The other characters, save that of Poirot, of course, are given just enough personality to make the plot work; but this is also expected in Christie's works.<br />  If you saw the dramatization of this book on A&amp;E, you will see how badly they bobbled the &quot;surprise ending&quot; and even changed Caroline's character in a totally unnecessary way. It does, however, pare away some of the really extraneous business that Christie added to make her plot more complicated.<br />  Nevertheless, here we are dealing with an excellent READING of the entire original work on six cassettes published by Audio Partners. In &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; and &quot;Murder on the Orient Express,&quot; which I have already reviewed, Audio Partners has David Suchet reading all the parts, using a different voice for each. Here we have actor Robin Bailey doing the honors and he is quite good. Of course, we might quibble that the character he is really playing, Dr. Sheppard, the writer of the journal, could not be quite so good a mimic; but as a reading, we suspend disbelief and enjoy Bailey's talent.<br />  What more to say? A very amusing novel read excellently is all one needs to give this Audio Partners offering a five-star rating.and he is quite good.

B00000K2SC|2.0|Great concept, but as usual Hollywood falls short.  Despite its obvious popularity, I can only say that this is a mediocre movie at best, but a fresh groundbreaking in the western film market nonetheless.  It's the visual effects influenced by Japanese anime that save it.  Everything else is rehashed regurgitated refuse.<br />The first problem is Keanu.  My suspended disbelief came crashing to the tatami mat, as I watched this uncoordinated lanky white guy pretending to know kung-fu.  It was farcical and embarrassing to see Keanu run up the side of a wall and flip in some sort of clumsy slow motion Karate Kid-like kick over Laurence Fishburne.  I give props to Keanu for doing the hard work practicing the moves, but I blame the directors for not hiding his lack of finesse, speed, and agility. (Laurence looked great however.)<br />Also, after Morpheus (Fishburne) did the incredible leap to the distant building, Keanu did his signature \\"Whu-oh.\\"  Did no one else expect him to turn and see Bill or Ted-whichever one he wasn't-from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and say \\"Awesome!\\" ?  <br />That's the only gripe about casting, everyone else were great choices.<br />Besides that and a few other instances of poor direction plus stupid plot devices (could we not have cut out the whole slow paced oracle scene?), there was the drawn out third act. I'm talking about the climax of the whole movie, where the bad androids are tearing into the ship as Trinity tells the incredibly dead Neo how much she loves him. The Wachowski brothers watched Disney's Beauty and the Beast a little too much I think.  When someone is dead, I don't care if you tell them you love them or what, they're not going to come back just to give you a kiss and make everything better and change into Superman.  I'm willing to accept it in a Disney cartoon, not a sci-fi/action flick.  The brothers should have let someone else write the intimate scenes because it comes off as trite and idiotic.  It reminds me ofTerminator 2 where Arnold the killing machine asks the boy \\"Why do you cry?\\".<br />I cry, Arnold, because folks think that poor scenes like this give the movie \\"heart\\".<br />Regardless, I still think this is a good movie worth the price of admission, I'm just not in love with it enough to fawn over Keanu, ignore the superficial plot, and to type in ALL CAPS.
B00005AXEL|4.0|Bolstered by the talents of guest artists such as Sheryl Crow and Lindsey Buckingham, \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\" has the potential to be an amazing comeback vehicle for Stevie Nicks.  Once again, Ms. Nicks has reinvented herself, and this iteration more closely resembles the Stevie Nicks of the early Fleetwood Mac years, perhaps even harking back to the Buckingham-Nicks days.  The tunes on Shangri-La are fresh and folksy, the lyrics less nebulous and self-absorbed than some of Nicks' past offerings.<br />Fans eager for reincarnation of the powerful rock-ballads that garnered Stevie much airplay in the `80's (`Edge of Seventeen', `Stand Back', `I Can't Wait') may be disappointed at first listen:  think `Landslide' (`It's Only Love') or `Sara' (`Bombay Sapphires') or `Leather N' Lace' (`Love Is') instead!  Even the rock ballad `Sorcerer', originally found on the \\"Streets of Fire\\" soundtrack, has been substantially reworked to have a much softer edge.<br />Ms. Nicks voice has recovered substantially from years of overwork and drug abuse, and has lost most of the chipmunk quality so disturbingly prevalent on her last effort \\"Street Angel\\".  Unfortunately, it does not approach the delightfully haunting vibrato of her early years; and one listening to the discordant `Too Far from Texas' wonders if songwriting, collaborations and harmonies, Stevie's unquestionable gifts, should become her focus instead of a solo career.  Quickly that notion passes as other songs such as `Planets of the Universe', `Everyday' (sure to top the charts if it gets the chance!) or the compellingly-dynamic `Fall From Grace' make you long for more and hope she will NEVER abandon us as a songstress!  <br />In a time when artists with dubious vocal renderings such as Macy Gray (who, incidentally, can be heard on `Bombay Sapphires') and Alanis Morissette gain public approbation and critical acclaim, Ms. Nicks, even in less-than-perfect vocal form, is certain discover a whole new legion of devoted fans, while rekindling the affection of those who've long followed her

If I enjoyed it a lot and had fun or was completely moved then it's 5 stars to me. Now there are going to be a lot of different 5 star movies.

When I started reading it I was getting more and more interested in the book, the more I read it. If you like war books and enjoy them, this book is for you. It will keep you going all the way to the end. It is so good that it will get you to get the hole series. I know when I get a chance I'm reading all the books by Orson Scott Card. This is a wonderful book to read and it is wurth your time to read.

0425148343|5.0|Peter Robinson's &quot;Wednesday's Child&quot; is about the abduction of a young girl named Gemma by a man and woman posing as child care workers.  They take Gemma from her negligent and abusive mother who is too ignorant to realize that this couple are a pair of impostors .  In addition, a low-class hoodlum is found viciously murdered near an abandoned smelting mill.  Are these two events related?  Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks and his colleagues, Superintendent Gristhorpe, Susan Gay and Phil Richmond, combine forces to uncover a cunning plan by a pair of malevolent criminals, one of whom is extremely dangerous and unpredictable. Robinson, as usual, captures the Yorkshire ambiance perfectly.  His ear for dialogue is uncanny and he has a remarkable talent for setting a scene perfectly and creating memorable characters.  The mystery and its solution are thoroughly satisfying.  &quot;Wednesday's Child&quot; is a wonderful and engrossing thriller by a master of the genre.
B00005BL2A|4.0|The most notable difference between this album and previous efforts is the slowed pace that Depeche Mode has taken.  Nearly all the songs are quite slow and have a relaxed feel.  There are many long intros and two instrumental tracks. The music is still moody, sonically interesting, and well-crafting.<br />Dave Gahan's voice is appropriately refined here.  Less booming than on SOFAD and Ultra, he has much better control of tone and volume.  It's hard to liken Exciter to any particular album previously.  Sonically, there are many similarities to Ultra, but overall there is a lighter feel. The songs are considerably less catchy than earlier albums, though not necessarily weaker. This is not the kind of album that you're likely to fall in love with on the first listen: these songs must be listened to several times.  They aren't as simple as the older works.<br />Though the album is quite good, it's missing something that Ultra (and most previous albums) had.  There's no excess fat like MFTM had, but the songs aren't quite as refined as they could be.  The most notable aspect is the lyrics.  Ultra really shines lyrically, but parts of Exciter fall short...not so much entire songs, but lines here and there.  &quot;It's difficult not to shine for me&quot;, &quot;we're in the zombie room,&quot; and other lines weaken otherwise good songs.<br />What's exciting about Exciter (an ironic title given the relaxed pace of this album) is that all the songs show new experimentation.  There's no rehashing of over-used ideas.  This is not a remake of a previous album.  These are truly new songs and DM is trying things they haven't before.  Bravo.
B00005BL2A|3.0|Yeah, it's good, because DM are fine artists and pros and their stuff is always fundamentally good, but doesn't anyone else think this album is a bit of a bore?  Why so mellow?  DM usually offers a few driving, muscular tunes among their lushly sedated numbers, but this album has too few.  &quot;Exciter&quot;?  Hardly.
B00004Z459|5.0|I'm sick of all these idiotic bands and rappers that have the same sound and sing about the same thing in every song. I'm talkin about Eminem, Limp Bizkit, etc. <br />Linkin Park music is actually something a lot of people can RELATE to, so its pretty powerful in some ways. It's a mix of lots of different sounds and its awesome. It's mostly rap and rock but sometimes it suddenly changes to slow music, or melodic, etc. <br />Every song on the CD is worth listening to, and the good thing is (for some reason) the cd never gets boring to listen to. I got it the first time it came out and I'm still loving it. <br />My advice, BUY THIS CD. It's a hell of a lot better then the likes of Limp Bizkit, etc.   Buy immediately
B00004RFCM|5.0|Sex and the City, one of the few HBO exclusive shows that I actually enjoy, is well known for its witty storylines and rich characters. Being 5 hours long, any fan of this television series would be proud to own The Complete First Season, and especially if you got into the show too late (as I did), it's nice to finally see the characters introduced. It all comes beautifully packaged, though the price could have been reduced by putting everything on one dual-sided DVD instead of two single-sided DVD's. <br />-l-
0131103628|5.0|I've been programming for a little over a year now, I've had two (very light) semesters of C++, and I use perl quite a bit as well.  I came to this book looking to get a solid foundation with C before pursuing my interests in compiler design and computer graphics programming.  The examples, I thought, were a bit more plausible than in many other programming books, and infact many are (sometimes scaled down) equivalents of standard library functions.  Moreover, the examples are very elegantly written, and get you thinking about clever ways to exploit this languages syntax.   Some of the concepts in this book are so dense (sometimes unrealistically, but for good reason), I would stare at the same few lines of code trying to decipher what it meant.  But that's what helped my C-contemplating brain-cells grow, and now I can decipher the meaning of many convoluted C statements very quickly.<br />I also thought 'Programming Perl' was a great programming book also, and I sometimes wonder if the popularity of these languages can be at least partially attributed to having great texts like this to learn them from.
B00005B36H|5.0|It's been approximately 5 years...people are asking, &quot;Is this worth the wait.&quot;  Let me put all this to rest right now...Yes!!  Tool has returned with another earth shattering epic.  After his time away with APC, Maynard has returned and is once again in rare form.  If you haven't picked this up yet, Do it.  Burying you in a blur of Thundering Drums and Pulsating Base from the get go, This album is a showcase of just what Tool is capable of.  But be forwarned, this is no pop marvel here, just Raw, Agressive, Emotional and Powerful.  Tool is not one to blitz through their music in hopes of getting a #1 song, they scrape to the bone and suck the marrow out until you're left with the most engrossing experience possible.  And they have done it again.  I have had this album for less than a week and it hasn't left my radio yet.  I am continually amazed by the added depth I discover in their songs each time I listen to it.  Let me just finish this off by saying if you are trying to find the total musical experience that will leave you saying I'm never putting this album down, then grab this album while you can...it will definitely earn it's keep and then some.
B00003CXP1|4.0|well when i first saw this movie, i was right on the heels of &quot;pi,&quot; one of my favorite movies and &quot;memento,&quot; one of the best movies of this year. anyhow, as i watched it i was blown away. the camera angles, soundtrack, everything was overwhelmingly amazing. however, i sympathize that to show the addicts' suffering aronofsky had to have such a bleak ending. but it was a little too bleak, albeit neccessary (it's just my opinion folks). it was great, but by no means was it a &quot;basketball diaries&quot; or a &quot;permanent midnight&quot; which in my opinion are very enthralling movies. i gave this film 4 stars due to it's gripping visuals/stimulants, but also because of it's plot. i wish i could give it a five but the last scenes really held me back... yours truly, john_doe
B000002V0Q|5.0|While not quite the joyride Youthanasia was, Countdown to Extinction is still an excellent Megadeth album. Dave Mustaine's trademarked sarcasm is in full force here, with songs such as Sweating Bullets and Captive Honor. Symphony of Destruction has one of Megadeth's coolest riffs and intros ever (not to mention some pretty crafty lyrics). And the song subjects, which often deal with war (Architecture of Aggression) and the government (Symphony of Destruction) ala Metallica's And Justice For All, are excellent. Overall, a superb album, and definately one no Megadeth fan should be with out.
B00005AXEL|2.0|While I love Stevie Nicks and consider her one of the best and most prolific artist of the time, I was very dissapointed with her latest CD.  First of all there is the fact that her singing is limited to 1 1/2 octave or less, which makes her voice sound very flat and monotonous.  There are no horrible vocal weirdnesses (as in &quot;the forgotten chimpanzee&quot; line in &quot;Jane&quot;), but no soaring highs like she used in the past (as in ANY song off &quot;The Wild Heart&quot;).  The only exception is the song &quot;It's Only Love&quot; in which she sings beautifully with minimal instrumentation.  Which brings me to the fact that Stevie insists on using other people to &quot;help&quot; her with her songs.  If anyone hears Stevie's stripped down versions of &quot;Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;Candlebright&quot;, they would know what I mean.  Stevie does NOT need all this extra fluff and does NOT need anyone to help her!  She is a gifted songwriter who can do it on her OWN.  I thought it was bad during the 80's with the synths but now someone talked her into using a programmed drum machine??  Listen to Tom Petty, Stevie!!
B00003CWL6|3.0|I didn't read all 600+ reviews for American Beauty listed on the Amazon site, but a cursory look gives me the impression that people get very polarised over this movie, and I can't understand why.  Is it an art movie?  Not really.  But it's as close as a Hollywood movie is likely to get, I suppose.  The acting is superb, but the characters are very two-dimensional.  Surprisingly, the most realistic character (to me) was the &quot;Beauty&quot; herself, Angela, who, as the object of male fantasies, would normally be the most two-dimensional.  So, while I enjoyed the movie, I don't care to watch it over and over.  It is dark, but heartwarming in its way, and parts are very funny as well.<br />The DVD additives are also only okay.  There is a director's commentary (the writer also is on the track, but says very little), but it focusses much more on technical issues (how shots were set up, lighting effects, etc.) rather than the more interesting (to me) and probably more appropriate plot issues.  There is a storyboard presentation (which goes on for a grueling hour), from which you learn little more than you could learn from the commentary.  The making-of feature is very short.  All in all, for something called the &quot;Awards Edition&quot;, there's little here worth having over what appears on the video.<br />Thus, while I enjoyed the movie, and can understand why the Academy and others gave it some awards, I don't think it's worth spending the money to buy it.
B00004Z311|4.0|This is one of those films that came and went so fast in the theatres, but haunted late-night cable for years to come afterward, much to my delight as a youngster! To my mind there has never been a fantasy film as rich and textural as Legend. This is pure cinema extravagance, even forgiving the sometimes odd script. The unicorns in the cherry tree forest; the giant's kitchen; Tim Curry's first appearance as he steps through the mirror...all exquisite scenes. The cinematography is constantly scintillating and glowing, the light vs. shadow metaphor gets played out endlessly here. Also the overdubbing on the child actors' voices to give them the character of adult faeries is rather unnerving and fascinating. This film is one of Ridley Scott's most interesting and should be seen if only to wonder how it got made in the first place. Finally, these two words: Billy Barty!!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|An innovative and interesting soundtrack and brings the musical back to hollywood:<br />Track 1.:  A good song for David Bowie fans (I am not one, but it wasn't an altogther bad song).  A little too moderate in tone, however.<br />Track 2.:  The song that's hitting the music charts.  Nice for the radio, but not much else.<br />Track 3.:  An interesting song that sounds like an energetic, updated Can-Can song for 2001.<br />Track 4.:  A good mixture of Monroe's &quot;Diamonds&quot; song and Madonna's &quot;Material Girl&quot;.  Nicole Kidman actually doesn't do a bad job in portraying both singers.<br />Track 5.:  A sort of pointless but energetic song that almost directly copies the song sung by Estefan.<br />Track 6.:  A nice take on Elton John's ballad by Ewan McGregor.  His heartfelt sincerity makes up for his inexperience, and he actually turns out to be rather charming.<br />Track 7.:  A nice, short song by Bono and Gavin Friday.<br />Track 8.:  Nicole doesn't have the delightful charm of Ewan, but she doesn't do too badly in this solo.  She actually sings with feeling and depth, if not with great talent.<br />Track 9.:  Possibly another radio song; but this one is certainly better than Track 2.  Beck doesn't do too bad; but he's obviously not the highlight of this soundtrack.<br />Track 10.:  Probably one of the best tracks, with a medley of love songs sung by Ewan and Nicole.  Delightful love medley (using from Elton John to U2 songs), which flows convincingly.<br />Track 11.:  A nice, pleasant duet by Ewan and Nicole.  Perfectly emits the tenderness their two characters have for each other.<br />Track 12.:  A surprisingly fun song.  Ewan sounds appropriately desperate.  Great music!<br />Track 13.:  Unfortunately, I did not like this one sung by Rufus Wainwright.  I guess they put it in because they needed one French song on the album.  Might appeal to other listeners, however.<br />Track 14.:  One of my favorites of the album.  Great music, all with an exotic flair.  Almost has a feeling of doom behind it.  (Wonder what happens in the movie during this song?)<br />Track 15.:  Another version of Track 1, this time Bowie joined with Massive Attack.  Less sleepy, but still not spectacular.<br />All in all, a worthwhile soundtrack for those who enjoy musicals with a modern twist.  Proves that even actors and actresses can sing!  Certainly a good introduction to the movie, and makes me interested in seeing it.  It will certainly be a &quot;Bohemian Storm&quot;!
B00005B6N8|5.0|Vin Diesel who plays the anti-hero hero in &quot;Pitch Black&quot; should inherit the muscle man movie roles of the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger, if this movie is any evidence.  Actually, Diesel is a much better actor than Arnie, and he is the core of this highly entertaining and frightening science fiction movie.<br />I was awed by some of the lighting and camera work; scenes shifting from hues of orange to brown to blue and then the eeriness of the eclipse.  But, lordy, what creatures.  Even though we know they are computer generated, one cannot help but admit they were some of the best monsters since &quot;Aliens&quot;.  The device of having them in the dark was superb, because not only did we fear the sight of them, but their haunting and frightening screams.<br />The overall casting was likewise effective, particularly Randha Mitchell as Fry, a complex and well-drawn female character that combined both strength and vulnerability, and an expressive face that worked beautifully for her.  Cole Hauser is effectively creepy as the addicted cop, who shifts from his early &quot;hero&quot; role to the true villain of the piece.  I also liked Claudia Black's tenacity and guarded sexuality, and Keith David's stereotypical religious leader.  Ketih managed to make him convincing.<br />But, it is Diesel who struts, grunts and muscles his way through the film; he is very good at showing expression with just a little twist of his mouth, and even with the &quot;see in the dark&quot; eyes, his final scene with Mitchell is both touching and unforgettable.<br />A great movie----let's look for more of David Twohy's brilliant conceptualization and style.
B000056NX4|5.0|I'm not a religious person. All I have ever known of the Bible has come from Andrew Lloyd Webber via the great voices of his performers. This is no exception!! I had no idea what I was getting myself into buying this video. I knew three songs from the Celebration video and greatest hits CD. The rest was just as good. Glenn Carter and Jerome Pardon give first rate performances as their characters, Jesus and Judas respectively. It begins with an overview of what's going on, with Jerome Pardon's rendition of &quot;Heaven on their Minds&quot;, in which he complains to Jesus about all the things he has let go &quot;sour&quot;. Glenn Carter's voice is like nothing i have ever heard. He sings all the notes that past Jesuses have sung, but he goes higher into what can be described as a pleasent sounding screech (that was a compliment). He does this in all the right places too; he doesn't make us sick of it by exploiting it too much (i know it's falsetto, but he controls it and holds it so well, and doesn't make any unpleasant sounding screeches). &quot;Gethsemane&quot; now ranks very high on my list of favorite songs. Renee Castle has a beautiful voice. These are just three of the many cast members of JCS. Every single one of them has a great voice, and can really act. The emotion shown on their faces, whether it's Judas complaining to Jesus, Jesus asking God why he wants him to die, or Mary's confusion as to how to love Jesus, it's all convincing (looking, at least).
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is full of adventure, romance, comedy, heroes, dragons, heroins......It's a great movie for all ages.  It's a must see if your a fan of &quot;fantasy&quot; movies!<br /> We watch it over and over again, and never get tired of it....
0783240503|4.0|I first saw Joseph when my middle school put it on. I was a part of the set crew, but as i watch this video, and have further experiences in acting and singing, i wish i had been part of the cast. Ok, so its not the greatest thing Webber has ever done (that would be Phantom), in fact most of it is stolen, but this performance was excellent. Donny Osmond is just the perfect Joseph, the music, stolen or not, was very happy and upbeat (with the obvious exception of &quot;Close Every Door&quot; and &quot;Cannan Days&quot;), what you would want in a family film, and the singing and dancing will make a viewer glow with happiness. It had just about every known color in it, which adds to the fun, especially during &quot;Joseph's Coat.&quot; Pharaoh rocks us into the second act very cool-like. The one objection that parents would have, with sharing this video with their kids, is Potifer's wife. I don't think its that bad, its a small part of the production, but if it bothers you, just fast forward through it and enjoy the rest of the show (its followed by the best song in the show). On a final note, the costumes were fantastic, especially Donny's coat (I only wish i could buy a coat like that here on amazon).
B00003CXB2|4.0|For the most part, the transfer was excellant.  The wide angle shots in the desert showed vertical stripes in the blue sky that looked like the film was flickering by.  Would have been nice if they had had a better print to transfer to DVD.  The story itself is fascinating, Lawrence the man, the people involved, the local politics, the international politics.
B00003CX8J|5.0|At last, with comic book adaptations, Hollywood is starting to get it right. The first, but hopefully not the last, movie to feature Marvel's merry mutants benefits immensely from a superb cast, an enthusiastic director, and an intelligent, thoughtful approach that makes this more than just another &quot;superhero&quot; flick.   In the near future, more and more people are revealing themselves as &quot;mutants&quot; - genetically altered people with superhuman powers. As the US government considers passing Senator Kelly's (Bruce Davison) Mutant Registration Act, two extremely powerful mutants ponder their species' fate. Telepathic Professor X (Patrick Stewart in the role he was born for) believes in teaching mutants to develop their powers for the good of mankind, whereas his old friend Magneto (Ian McKellan) wants simply to wipe the human threat out. Caught in the middle of all this are Rogue (Anna Paquin), a young mutant with energy-sapping powers, and Wolverine (a superb Hugh Jackman), an older, battle-hardened mutant.   And so the scene is set for great fun and action, as well as far more character development than you'd usually expect from this sort of film (you certainly didn't get it in Batman and Robin!). Thanks to Bryan Singer for showing Hollywood that you can make great superhero films, you only need to respect your material.   The DVD transfer of this excellent movie only serves to make you appreciate it that much more, with a great attention to both visual and audio detail. In fact, it is one of the best quality DVDs on the market! The extras, whilst not many in number, are certainly fun to sift through more than once. The &quot;Mutant Watch&quot; featurette is a lot of fun, and much better than the standard &quot;Making Of&quot; documentaries that get churned out. The character designs hint at hero and villain outfits that seem much better than the costumes that ended up onscreen (there is also a hidden section that looks at two unused characters, Beast and Blob), as does the production designs (ultimately, I believe that it was Fox Studios capping the budget that made the director rethink his approach). Also of note is Hugh Jackman's great screen test for Wolverine, which makes you wonder why he wasn't even considered initially.   All in all, great value for money. Roll on X-Men 2...
B000059TPN|5.0|This DVD is superb! The transfer is brilliant, the extra's are amazing, and the film is one of the best action movies ever made! The Film: The plot of the movie is as follows. A Marine General (Ed Harris) steals some chemical weapons and takes the old prison of Alcatraz as his base of operations. He trains the weapons on San Fransisco, and tells the government that he wants money to be given to the families of the Marines killed under his command. The government turns to an FBI chemical specialist (Nicolas Cage), an imprisoned ex-SAS soldier (Sean Connery) and a team of Navy SEALs (led by Michael Biehn) to get rid of the threat. Needless to say, there are a lot of explosions and gun battles during the course of the assault on Alcatraz.<br />The Extras: The extras on this edition are brilliant! The best feature is The Do's and Don'ts of HollyWood Gunplay, hosted by Harry Humphries and Marshall Teague (he plays one of the SEALs in the movie). It shows some of the mistakes made in films during gun sequences, and how dangerous these can be. Other extras include a brilliant documentary about the prison itself, and some great info about the special effects in the movie.<br />All in All, a great buy, and one of the best DVD's available!
B000056K04|3.0|I just got back from the DMB concert in Vegas.. and its clear even when they perform that their heart is not as much in this album.. <br />I really enjoy the songs When the World Ends and The Space Between but if I could find a way to remove I Did It from the CD I would.. <br />If you are new to Dave Matthews and you want to hear the songs on the radio, buy the cd.. but actually his older material is much stronger musically with much more percussion, horns, and bass..  The songs are much longer but more intellectually stimulating..  Of his older albums the best would be Under the Table and Dreaming or Before These Crowded Streets.. of his live albums (even more musically stimulating) Live at Luther College with Tim Reynolds is a fantastic 2 cd set.. <br />And quite honestly.. I have just heard the Lillywhite sessions.. the unreleased album that scrapped for Everyday...  I hope he releases it at some point.. I will be the very first in line to purchase it..
B00004CWO8|5.0|I first glimpsed this edition of Swan Lake on T.V. in Reno,Nv. It was a 2 min view.And I went crazy for two years, until I saw it on pbs. Words escape me in trying to tell you,the viewer, my emotions in watching this preformance. <BR>Matthew Bourne&quot;s Choreography, is nothing short of brilliant.And, if u see the movie &quot;Billy Elliott, you will see part of the performance of Adam Cooper. The vivid colors in the DVD, are just that, VIVID and you get a three dimentional look as well.The menu is informative, with a lot of info on the cast The cast were all excellent.  Adam Cooper stole the show with his virile adaptation of The Swan. This is a must see for anyone who likes the corps de ballet. And for anyone who finds it hard to sit thru a ballet. The actions and expressions of the Swans. Are magnificent. And it will take you far and away from your daily problems...ciao yaaah69

B00004XONN|5.0|Right now i'm going to school to become an audio engineer so naturally I've critically listened to a lot of music and granted, there is such a thing as music that's too experimental... music that's inaccesible and rediculious.  But people COME ON!!! ART IS SUPPOSED TO BE CHALLENGING!!  Kid A IS NOT, i repeat IS NOT too experimental, you're just too closed minded!    Believe it or not, I absolutely loved Kid A ever since i first heard it and no i don't say i love something just because it's Radiohead.  It might have something to do with being a patinet listener, not demanding a sugar coated hook every ten seconds and appreciating the music for what it is.  MTV and radio have ruined people's perception of good music.  But don't worry, Amnesiac is much more songy and traditional except for &quot;Pulk Pull Revolving Doors.&quot;  One last thing: ART MUST PROGRESS WITH MANKIND!!  HELP IT OR GET OUT OF THE WAY!!
B00003CXDG|3.0|One thing's for sure: this isn't Brian DePalma's Mission: Impossible.  This M:I was directed by John Woo, famous for Broken Arrow and Face/Off, which means lots of slow-mos, lots of fancy-pants flip-kicking, and lots of miraculous, one-handed gun shooting.  I'm not sure whether I like John Woo's style for M:I or not, but DePalma's was more realistic, more emotional, more interesting and in my opinion, better all around.  However, the fact that Woo's style does not fit Mission: Impossible does not make M:I2 a bad movie.<br /><br />All gripes aside, M:I2 is a good movie, especially for what looked like a mindless action flick compared to the first.  The plot is (disappointingly) simple: Tom Cruise reprises his role as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, who is tracking fellow IMF agent Sean Ambrose, played by Dougray Scott.  Hunt is trying to recover a fatal genetically-engineered virus which kills whomever it infects within 20 hours.  Ambrose has stolen both the virus and its antidote for financial gain, £37,000,000 to be exact.  In order to find out Ambrose's plans, Hunt sends his ex-girlfriend, Nyah Hall (whom he has already fallen in love with...and slept with), played by Thandie Newton.  Personally, I think the romance between Ethan and Nyah was totally unneccessary.  It didn't add much to the plot and it seemed very generic.<br /><br />At first I didn't like the fact that you know who the bad guy is, until the infiltration scene, where Ethan must sneak into the building where the virus is being kept and detroy them.  I realized then why they did it.  You see, Ambrose had been Hunt's impersonator (this isn't a spoiler, we find this out early in the movie) and because he know Hunt's way of doing things, it creates a spy vs. spy scenerio where one is always one step ahead of the other one.  You never know who's going to come out ahead.<br /><br />What M:I2 lacks in sophistication and emotional substance, it makes up for with great action and suspense.  This comes as no surprise, because that is what John Woo is best known for.  The hand-to-hand(-to-flying-kick) fight scenes were really intense.  Just when it looks like Ethan's winning, his opponent manages to turn the tables on him, and vice versa.  This worked well especially in the final battle.<br /><br />Woo does overuse use his slow-mos.  There's at least one every five minutes.  It's almost as if the movie wasn't long enough so he decided to play it in slow-mo.  He does use them appropriately however, and they do create the effect he was going for, but they do get a little irritating after a while.  His use of colors is a little techno-ish.  They are always bright and vibrant no matter what's happening in the movie.  He does occationally separate colors to set moods, like blue lights for suspense and things like that, but for the most part the movie is very colorful, certainly a contrast from DePalma's infiltration scene, where everything was black and white for a neutral effect.<br /><br />The music, by Hans Zimmer, was a bit excessive.  Also, I didn't like the techno-metal score alone, but again, it worked very well for Woo's style.  I prefer Danny Elfman's more soothing, emotional, percussion-driven score from the first movie; but I will admit, I am a bit biased since Danny Elfman is my favorite composer.<br /><br />And I can't write this review with out mentioning the chase scenes, which were some of the most exciting I've ever seen outside of a James Bond film.  The scene in the beginning where Ethan and Nyah are playing cat-and-dog in their high-class sports cars was intense, especially since they were on on windy cliff-side road and there were actually civilian cars for them to avoid.  The motorcycle chase at the end wasn't as original as the train scene in the first M:I, but it was easily just as exciting.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great movie.  It has a great plot, great action scenes, and enough surprises to keep on your toes.  I missed the intricate plot twists like in the first M:I, and I didn't exactly walk away from the movie in awe, but it held my interest and kept me on the edge of my seat.  Some of the lines were kind of corny, especially Ambrose's, who is basically your run-of-the-mill bad guy, only with some foresight; and as I mentioned before, the romance between Hunt and Hall was useless and hardly integral to the plot, the movie would have worked fine if their relationship remained professional.  These things aside Mission: Impossible II stands alone as a fun and exciting film which doesn't disappoint...as long as you don't try comparing it to the first.  I only wish Anthony Hopkins had had a bigger part in the film.<br /><br />P.S. There are a lot of great bonuses on this DVD, along with the typical trailers and music videos, there are also many \\"making of\\" videos, including in-depth documentaries on every major stunt (99% of which Cruise did himself...the movie is worth watching just to see the actor do all his stunts, including the scary knife-to-eye scene).  Also, as has already been mentioned before, there is the very funny Mission: Improbable from the MTV Movie Awards.  (Ben Stiller loves making fun of Tom Cruise, I guess.  He did a parody of the first M:I at another MTV Movie Awards)<br /><br />In closing, I recommend this DVD.  It's fun to watch, and though lacking in substance, excels in action and enjoyment.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This album is great! I am not being bias when I say this either. I am 23 and I have loved Stevie for nearly a decade now. I have all of her albums, bootlegs, singles etc. Never has Stevie sounded so good since 1977's Rumours and 1981's Bella Donna. Not only does the music sound good but also the lyrics, Stevies voice and sound of Stevie dueting with Natalie Maines on Too Far From Texas and the background vocals of Sarah McLachlan in Love Is. I definitely recommend this album to everyone even the non-Stevie Nicks fans. I hope that this success of hers continues and spills over into Fleetwood Mac.

Bryson's imaginatively creative literary prowess is put to the test as he once again subjects us to his ridiculous re-enactments of incidents.  He invests in his humour a great amount of liberty, to take a stab at anything and everything possible.<br />As he recounts his meetings with the people of Australia, the up-close-and-personal experiences with the dangerous fauna of the country as well as the absurdest of place names in the land, you cannot help but marvel at his ability to take you along with him on the ride.<br />Be warned.  Reading this book in public may result in having people giving you strange looks when you double up in uncontrolled laughter, not to mention your contorted appearance should you decide to hold it in.<br />This book, however, is not just a bag of laughs.  Bryson provides many glimpses into the history of Australia, including snippets of information of the politics and culture of the land.  The world-famous landmarks like the Sydney Opera House and Uluru (better known as Ayer's Rock) are touched on and given a life of their own in his marvellous description.  He even risks it by telling the stories of the native Aborigines.<br />Get this book if you have never read Bill Bryson.  You'll want to read the rest after that.

B000002A3T|4.0|I loved this album.  I have been a PF fan for years, I grew up with their music. (2nd generation Floyd fan). I admit I had to listen to the album a few times, but I really love it.  Here we are 7 years later (Where is the new album??????) and I still listen to it and my son (3rd generation PF fan) listens to it also.  Gilmour's strong suit was never lyrics, but the music is haunting and beautiful.  I was never a Roger Waters fan (his voice always sounded like something or someone in agonizing pain), but he could write some great thought provoking lyrics.  The mix of the four (Gilmour, Mason, Wright and Waters) will always be Floyd (Dark Side of the Moon IS Pink Floyd), but Gilmour and company (without Waters) is great to listen to also.
0440211727|5.0|This was in fact John Grisham's first novel and it was by far his best work.  The characters were real, and disturbing in nature.  The plot was and is timely and the story was extremely compelling.  This novel dared to address the race issue in America, in a calm, realistic and believable manner.  If you are looking for a page turner, then this is your novel.  Be ready to be disturbed by the brutal nature of the crimes within the bindings of this book, however, rest assured that in the end, right will win out.  Great job Mr. Grisham!!
B000059MEK|1.0|Homework devestates this album. Why is daft punk singing and about love none the less? Its total TRL pop crap. The songs that are instrumental just don't have the same rythmic driving beats homework had. They almost remind me of cheesy video game music. Save your money...i wish i did.
1586210912|1.0|This book is as worthless as any other &quot;get rich&quot; book out there.  If this book &quot;changes your life&quot; as previous reviews state, then you have some serious issues.  <br />Honestly, this book could have been condensed into about 10 pages, but Kiyosaki continues to ramble on with cute little stories, cliché quotes, and &quot;motivational&quot; examples.  He is so redundant that even if you are so thick headed that you haven't picked up his point by the tenth time he's said it, DON'T WORRY, he's going to say it another 10 times.  <br />This book is no different from those ridiculous advertisements on tv at 2 in the morning where that little guy bounces around and says &quot;I've made millions by putting tiny ads in newspapers... and you can too!&quot;   The only person making any money here is Kiyosaki, who chose yet another titillating title to woo buyers into thinking they (the &quot;poor and middle class&quot;) are missing out on some &quot;monumental&quot; secret.  Get real.  All his &quot;secrets&quot; are hinted at:  buy real estate, invest in small corporations, become your own corporation... there is no real substance beyond, like I said, 10 pages.  <br />In his book, he says, &quot;save your money and find yourself a good accountant&quot;.  Excellent advice Robert.  Skip this book and save your money for a more worthwhile read or council.
B000006TRV|3.0|In high school I, like about 65% of high school students in the English-speaking world, thought this was one of the greatest albums ever. It really seemed to capture the isolation, passion, and despair of those years. I'm a little older now, and I have come to realize that this album is an emotionally immature, irrational, and fairly mediocre (for Floyd) piece of work. It's better than, say, &quot;Animals&quot; or any of the post-Watters stuff, but nowhere near as good as &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, let alone &quot;Dark Side&quot;. A good album, but one that seems a lot less good once you grow out of it. Strangely (this isn't the case with most bands), Floyd's earlier work would be better for a serious, thoughtful music fan.
B00005ABX0|5.0|Well, it's about time! I've been waiting a very long time for definitve reissues of the Beach Boys catalog on CD. The old CD issues generally sound pretty lousy, and many of the discs were unavailable or out of print. I'm so glad that this series is being released, and they really are doing it right. First, they represent awesome values, especially considering the price-gouging going on with major label CD's. You can get two full-length, unedited albums on one disc for less than the price of many single-album CDs. Oh, and these records are $%&amp;^$#$$*#@! brilliant!!! The sound is amazing. The 24-bit remastering process reveals details and a sense of air that anyone with a half-way decent stereo will appreciate. The leap in quality is comprabable to that heard with the new CCR remasters that came out last year. The music is great. Of course, Pet Sounds is THE best record ever, but... Smiley Smile and especially Wild Honey would have sounded like full-on masterworks if Pet Sounds hadn't come out first. If these were the only two records the Boys had ever put out, they would still be remembered fondly. If you have never heard these discs, this a great package to pick up. If you love Pet Sounds, you'll probably love these almost as much and... who knows?  Maybe even more... If you are not really familliar with the Beach Boys and only know 'Surfin' USA&quot; etc. try these albums, they may change your mind about one of the most talented, misunderstood bands in the history of pop music.
B00000JCOV|4.0|When I first bought this cd it was one of the best cds i had ever bought. Songs like Wait and Bleed, Me inside, and Diluted really brought me around to the fast action that is to be Slipknot. The singer has a great voice, if he would use it more instead of trying to scream every word I would still love this group. The music is great if your trying to get motivated but tends to fade out if your looking for just a cd to stay in your stereo.
B00001OH7G|5.0|This is just a great cd if you have a love for great guitar work,and blues rock music.This is probably one of rory finest cd`s and his best live cd.This has the fantastic acoustic song as the crow flies.You have to check out that guitar work,not many people could play a guitar like that,and you will not find anybody in these new bands that like to play all glowm &amp; doom music.If you want one great cd,buy this and you will wear it out,i promise.
B00004U28G|5.0|Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Annie Hall, Convoy, these film's names are often bandied about whenever a serious discussion of the greatest American films ensues. However there is one that stands, head and shoulders, above the rest. Literally dwarfing the competition. The Cannonball Run is that behemoth. Never before had such an amazing array of talent been assembled for one film. We are treated to the combined acting prowess of Roger Moore, Farrah Fawcett, Dom DeLuise, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Terry Bradshaw, Jackie Chan, Bert Convy, Jamie Farr (as the sheik!), Peter Fonda, Bianca Jagger, Jimmy The Greek, Mel Tilis, and the one, the only Mr. Burt Reynolds as the indomitable J.J. McClure. This film tells the story of an illegal, cross-country car race that attracts an assortment of eccentric entrants (above listed actors) who will stop at nothing to win. Ultimately however, it is a tale of the triumph of the human spirit over insurmountable odds, the EPA (in the form of Arthur J. Foyt) and the Police. Not mention being one hell of a vehicle for Burt Reynolds' ego, as most of his pictures were. We get to see him degrade Dom DeLuise thoroughly, not only during the movie, but also during the credits as they roll outtakes of Burt literally beating the hell out of the lovable oaf he used as his sidekick for so many years. This movie reflects a time and an innocence long gone in America. Filmed in 1981 it is still very much of the free-spirited, sex and drug fueled 70s that had yet to dissipate during the Reagan \\"Just Say No\\" 80s. Most obviously evidenced by the passionate way these drivers embraced Recreational Drunk Driving (most noticeably the two duos of Dean and Sammy and Bradshaw - Tilis), it is a quality I find sorely lacking in today's Cinema. The film was made before the term Politically Correct had been coined. It treats Authority, Women and Minorities with equal disrespect. In fact it seems to revel in irreverence, and cheap stereotypes abound. We'vegot the Jamie Farr Sheik, The Tilis/Bradshaw Rednecks, Rick Aviles as Mad Dog; The Cannonball Run did not hesitate to offend anyone. The only rule it seems the producers laid down was that they couldn't make Burt look bad. So long as it served Reynolds' ego, go for it. And go for it they did. It's only too bad that we'll never see another classic like this again.
B000000XCH|5.0|It shouldn't take long for one to realize that many of the CCR tunes he/she heard on the radio all of these years came from this album. The band's original lineup would not last much longer after this release, so it seems almost fitting that they seemed to pull out all of the stops. Somehow, the opening bone cruncher &quot;Ramble Tamble&quot; has been overlooked as one of the best songs ever recorded by CCR (or by anyone for that matter, as it's one of my personal favorites). &quot;Run Through the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Up Around the Bend&quot;, and a great version of &quot;I Heard it Through the Grapevine&quot; (don't believe some of the other reviews on this one) are all here as well as a lot more. This is a great place for any potential CCR fan to start. Enjoy and play loud!
B000002KN8|4.0|Depeche Mode appeared on the world with &quot;Speak and Spell&quot;, their first album. The new romantic era has appeared,and Depeche Mode were the kings. On this album, there are good songs, like &quot;Dreaming of me&quot; and &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot;. It also contains Depeche's first classic: &quot;Just can't get enough&quot; I really recommend this album to everyone, but it is an all electronic album. If you're fan, you must have it, and if you want to know about music, it would be interesting for you to know the first album of one of the greatest bands of all the time: DEPECHE MODE.
B00001SIES|5.0|Each time I listen I find myself turning it up louder!!! I can't wait to hear the new album ORIGIN OF SYMMETRY!! I can only find it in the UK!! Also If you &quot;love&quot; Muse, check out THE DIN PEDALS, or  PALOALTO, I think you'll fall in love! N
B000053VAF|4.0|What if two fallen angels found a loophole that could get them back into heaven? Now what if that same loophole might just cause the destruction of the entire universe?<br />That's the premise of this wonderful movie. (And don't believe the rumors you've heard about blasphemy and damnation for all that see it!)<br />With plenty of theological &quot;inside jokes&quot; to keep any Catholic school graduate enthralled, the plot, action and dialog all make this a very enjoyable and compelling film. Truly comical. Truly intellectual (Hey! don't let that put you off!). But mostly, truly enjoyable.<br />If you liked Jay and Silent Bob from Mall Rats, you'll love this film!
0385501560|3.0|I am a huge fan of Chuck P.  But this novel is just like an excercise in everything he has already done.<br />not many new ideas and the hooks and gimmicks he uses are growing slightly old.  not terrible or boring, but not even close to great.<br />i thought he'd take more chances but apparently there's not much left in the tank.  Chuck's good at what he does, but what he does is getting repetitive.  <br />still better than most of the...[stuff] out there.  But his worst to this date.  at least if you read it last.
B000002JR8|5.0|&quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; is tied with &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; for Pantera's best album.  Every song is great and has the trademark Pantera guitar crunch, courtousy of Dimebag Darrell, and Phil's vocals have never sounded as good as they do on here, so do yourself a favor and pick this up.
B000021Y77|5.0|In this German movie, a young girl named Lola (Potente) must get 20,000 marks to her boyfriend Manni (Bleibtreu) in 20 minutes or he will die.  The premise sounds kind of dumb, but the execution is phenomenal.  In the great tradition of Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, Lola is given multiple chances to get things right.  Lola's first attempts, which end in tragedy, place her right back where she started.  All along the way, the audience gets to see how the smallest and seemingly insignificant actions can have the largest consequences.  This film speaks volumes about the potential that each human being has to change their life and the lives of others.  When I first saw this movie, I couldn't help but become completely engrossed in the film.  In some movies, the simplest plots produce the most complex and interesting story lines.  This is definitely one of those.  Through the simple and seemingly silly premise, the characters bring up very interesting questions about love, family, society, and human needs.  Like the other movies I have listed, I recommend this one full heartedly to anyone who is looking for a unique film.  I recommend you watch this movie in German dubbing and English subtitles for the full effect however, rather than simply English dubbing.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Everything about this movie is great, special effects, storyline, and the casting as well.  Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, and my God can he play him great.  Patrick Stewart is Professor X (naturally), and he is great as well.  This is the start of a dynasty since a sequel is in the works.  I just hope it doesn't end up like the Batman series.
B00004U8H4|4.0|In this controversial movie based on the even more controversial book, a money grubbing business man, Patrick Bateman (Bale) unleashes the monster growing inside him by gruesomely murdering all the people that either get in the way of his ambition, bother him, or flat out disgust him.  Lurking under all of the shocking scenes of death and sex lays a message about the greed, materialism, and soullessness that dominated the business world and culture of the 1980's.  Although I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is still somewhat sensitive to violence in movies, both the entertainment and philosophical value of this movie makes this film a very worthwhile use of time.  Bateman's intense daily routine of hygiene and the fierce competition between businessmen over business cards are just two examples of the both hilarious eccentricities of the characters in the film and the dark result of a lifetime characterized by ambition and vanity.  This film brings up interesting points about the interchangeability of human beings in modern culture.  Bateman's decent into insanity leads wonderfully into the very fulfill climax.  The conclusion of this movie will leave questioning what happened you just saw and scared of who the people around you might really be.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I'm sure you've heard all the hype about this album, and it's all true.  Moby's \\"Play\\" album is one of the best musical experiences I've ever witnessed, and it's an instant classic.  Every single song is good, and each is layered beautifully so you'll be sure to hear something different each time you listen to it.  The songs range from extremely danceable to sweet and soft so you'll have a song available for whatever mood you're in.  The first half of the album is the most recognizable with such hits as \\"Honey\\", \\"Porcelain\\", \\"Why Does My Heart Feel so Bad?\\", \\"South Side\\", \\"Bodyrock\\", \\"Natural Blues\\", and \\"Run On\\"...  Wow, the list of hits just keeps on coming.  Another song I really like is \\"Machete\\".  But the other half of the album is just as good and is worth listening to, although less recognizable.  So, in other words, this album is a fantastic value and it'll have a permanent place in your collection.  <br />Also, when I ordered \\"Play\\", it came with a \\"South Side (Featuring Gwen Stefani) (Edit)\\" bonus CD Single as the album had the original version without Gwen.  I don't know if they're still doing this, but I got it when I ordered, so it's a good possibility they still are.<br />I absolutely love this album and I wish I could give it more that 5 stars.  It's utterly brilliant and it's a masterpiece for our time.
B000002UAU|5.0|Is Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band the greatest rock album ever released?  Probably not.  After all, The Beatles have such classics as Revolver and The White Album to compete with.  However, it is certainly one of the most influential albums of the rock era.  Eliminating the gap between songs on the LP was perhaps one of the greatest things to happen to prog-rock, and the dense layering and multitude of effects used by the band are still amung the most inovative.  Possibly the only problem with the album is that Paul is, artistically, far more evident than John.  While a few of John's songs (Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, A Day in the Life, and his Ringo-fare piece, With A Little Help From My Friends), are amung his greatest, Being For the Benefit of Mr Kite! feels somehow incomplete, and Good Morning, Good Morning is little more than a trippy throw-a-way song.  Still, these songs would be among the best for any group besides the Beatles.  On the other hand, Paul's pieces are consistantly strong and varied, from the piano driven Lovely Rita to the melancholy She's Leaving Home to the bright and vibrant guitars of Getting Better.  George only contributes one piece, Within You Without You, but it is one of his greatest, and sometimes considered- even by the other Beatles- to be the best piece on the album. The cover and album notes are classic, and worth the price of the CD alone.  All around, this is an album that everey music fan should own.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is such a listening experience that any fan of rock should love it. Nirvana combined the melody and talent of classic rock artists like Led Zepplin and Cheap Trick with the energy and emotion of punk acts like Black Flag and the Ramones. In short they created the modern alternative sound. I think that the only other Nirvana album this good is &quot;In Utero&quot;, but I would heartily recommend that you at least listen to all of Nirvna's recordings. Even though Nirvana is my favorite band, I'm not simply hyping them up. Real talent and emotion deserve credit. So rock fans, if don't already own this, buy it!! Non-rockers, you might want to check this out as well, you may indeed enjoy it. Also check out Smashing Pumpkins,Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden for some more great alternative rock.
B00004U2G4|5.0|Before Led Zeppelin I, there was Jeff Beck's Truth. This album is arguably the first heavy metal album, and even if it's not the original, it's certainly one of the founding fathers.  Beck casts a mold here that is modelled nearly song for song by the later Led Zeppelin I.   There's the opening fast rocker (Shapes of Things/Good Times Bad Times).   Two covers of Willie Dixon songs (You Shook Me, I Ain't Superstitious/You Shook Me, I Can't Quit You Babe) The acoustic instrumental (Greensleeves/Black Mountain Side) The perfect live extended-jam number (Blues Deluxe/Dazed and Confused) The short, pulsing number (Beck's Bolero[written, insidently, by Jimmy Page]/Communication Breakdown) And the suprising, sentimental cover song (Old Man River/Babe I'm Gonna Leave You) In short, Truth is the dawn of heavy metal.  The reason Led Zeppelin I is credited so often as the first is because after Truth, Beck largely moved away from heavy metal while Led Zeppelin would continually redefine the genre.
0790701251|5.0|Buried (ritually?) in the credits of this movie is the real reason for its unseemly bifurcation of plot and story.  Readers of Gustave Halbert's &quot;The Short-Timers&quot; will be entertained by the most realistic portrayal of Parris Island Marine Corps recruit training but disappointed when, during the &quot;war&quot; half of the movie, Kubrick shifts Joker's climactic &quot;murder&quot; scene to be one where he confronts the wounded teenage Viet Cong woman who has decimated his squad with accurate sniper fire.  The realism of the first half of the movie would lead us to expect not one heartbeat of hesitation--thus there is no real tension in this scene.  Too bad he didn't retain Halbert's dilemma of having Joker face killing his own man who had been repeatedly riddled by the sniper's bullets.   Nonetheless, reviewers are correct in describing the film as a series of disconnected episodes, actually a patchwork of scenes that simply represent Vietnam cliches and touchstones of war's insanity.  In this respect, it really is more faithful to the incomprehensible realities of Vietnam than a hackneyed naturalistic rendition, or the Vietnam incarnation of &quot;High Noon,&quot; Oliver Stone's &quot;Platoon.&quot;
068485015X|5.0|Whether I found this book, or it found me, is hardly relevant these days. What I do know is that it was timely, life-altering, and poignant in its depiction of life, love, spirituality, and psychology as we know it.<br />Oftentimes, one comes across a reading that takes itself too seriously, tries in vain towards guru posturing, or comes apart in cotton candy rhetoric. The Road Less Traveled offered a most healthy balance of esoteric spirituality and somewhat &quot;in your face&quot; science and information regarding humanity, its choices and options for a better self/world.<br />No one coming away from this piece will doubt that there is always hope, and a glory and grace undefined in taking the road less traveled in our interactions with self and others.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I was most fortunate to be in L.A. during the preview weekend, and found this to be the most amazingly brilliant and original film I've seen in many years. I can tell that this film may not be for everyone, as it was so different from my expectations. The first 30 minutes are frenetic and more than I bargained for, and after the film was over I wasn't sure how I felt about it.  I don't pretend to know much about film making, but upon awakening the next morning I realized I had been completely  blown-away and I have been obsessed with Moulin Rouge &amp; Nicole ever since. My senses and emotions have been reeling, and it took a while to realize I had seen a most remarkable effort that we may not see again for some time. Baz Luhrmann is genius, and Nicole Kidman and cast (Ewan McGregor! and John Leguizamo!) have my profound respect for risking their careers in such a bold, daring work - and a musical at that!  Way to go, Nicole! Everything in the film was perfect and brilliant while balancing on such a fine line.  It works! Costumes, art direction, cinematography, acting, music, singing and choreography create visions you will not soon forget.  The use of contemporary songs and music will surprise and delight.  And the story of &quot;truth, beauty, freedom and love&quot; set against the bohemian backdrop of the Montmartre district of Paris 100 years ago will entertain you, from the madcap comedy of errors in the beginning to the emotional crescendo that grabs your heart at the end.  Again, this may not be for everyone, but I can't aplogize for my enthusiasm and over-the-top hyperbole...  go along for the colorful spectacular ride and perhaps you will find the magic of the Moulin Rouge as well.
B0000027F3|5.0|Judas Priest are the perfect heavy metal band. From the early 70's with their progressive rock/metal approach to this 1990 utterly heavy metal release. The result is fantastic. Ten excellent heavy songs, and you just cannot ask for anything better. The top slaying highlights of this ripping album include the one and only Nightcrawler, the mood setting Touch Of Evil,  the excellent title track, All Guns Blazing and just about any other song... K.K and Glen's solos are at their best, and Halford voice just couldn't be any better. All in all an amazingly good and heavy album, not the usual JP, but certainly not worse.  If you want the second part of Painkiller the closest you can get to is with Rob Halford's Resurrection album, not as shiny but still worth every penny. HAIL TO THE PRIEST!
B000059HGY|5.0|This movie was based on the book &quot;At Dawn We Slept&quot; by Gordon Prange, in my opinion the foremost analysis of the preliminaries and the attack itself.  A full scale battleship Nagato, flagship of the Rengo Kantai was constructed as was a full scale flight deck of Admiral Nagumo Chuichi's flaship, carrier Akagi.  The special effects are excellent, in fact in one of the scenes of the airfield's being attacked, an actual disaster was just averted when a burning aircraft taxiing to take off spun into a row of parked P-40 fighters.  This was not meant to take place and the actors and crew being viewed running about are really in fear of their lives.  The scene was kept intact in the movie due to its &quot;realism&quot;.  The buildup to war is skillfully protrayed as each part of the Japanese 14 part diplomatic message is received and interpreted by US decoders and tension naturally builds.  The only mar on an otherwise excellent movie is the use of some modern ships in the battle scenes, a defect shared by the 2001 release.  The cataclysm to battleship row is incredibly portrayed with feats of heroism counterbalanced by the heavy blows being dealt to the capital ships by Japanese aircraft of the Kido Butai (Carrier Striking Force).  This is the best movie I have seen about Pearl Harbor, the attack and Admiral Yamamoto's disillusionment when he discovered that the first bomb fell prior to a declaration of war.
B00003CXD0|4.0|Finally, one of the all time greatest movies is out on DVD!  The digital anamorphic picture is excellent as is the newly remastered Dolby digital 5:1 sound.  BUT THE DVD &quot;BONUS&quot; FEATURES ARE WEAK!!!  There is no commentary from the director or anyone in the movie, no alternate scenes or outakes, not even a original trailer for the movie!!!  The only &quot;bonus&quot; material included are the &quot;Production Notes&quot; which are printed on a sheet of paper inside the DVD packaging and 3 trailers for Groundhog Day, Hook and one other movie that have nothing to do with Tootsie!!!!  Also included is a cheesy filmography for Hoffman, Lange, Murry and Pollak.<br />This DVD was in production at Columbia Tristar for a number of years... besides the excellent video and sound transfers - WHAT THE HECK TOOK THEM SO LONG!?!?  For a film that was recently ranked as #2 as one of the funniest films of all time, it sure got a shabby treatment upon its DVD re-release.<br />In short, buy this DVD for the excellent sound and video quality...  not for any DVD supplemental material.  It is 5 Star movie, but a 2 Star DVD release.
0446310786|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've read in a VERY VERY long time. The truth is that when I had to read this bok it was so that I could write a book report. I was sure this book would be so boring. But then I started it and I read it in 2 days (I couldn't put it down!) To Kill a Mockingbird deliveers strong messages of conscience and the realization of how strongly racial prejudice is embedded in the hearts of some people. The book mainly tackled issues of discrimination , but you will be surprised at how NOT run-of-the-mill it is in comparison with other books of the same topic. The narration by Scout is perfect, the metaphors of Mr Raymond, Boo Radley and of course Tom Robinson as mockingbirds is pure genius. I really think everyone who has the ability to read should get this book.You will undoubtedly fall in love with it.  And when you read it a second time the very first page suddenly becomes so much clearer!
B00003CXP0|5.0|This film takes the life out of you. It leaves you with your mouth hanging to the floor every time you embark on its journey.  After seeing it in the theater twice I refuse to believe that anyone should see it cut-that would be sacreligious! As intense as the film is, I will admit many may not stomach it...but if you are daring and love movies that mentally leave you in turmoil, this is it. I'm disappointed that the Academy can overlook something so real as to not nominate it for best picture...but I am not at all surprised. Works such as this one will never get the credit they deserve by society, and those who have seen it will agree.  I can only state that this film is like a mystical experience-you are left speechless, lifeless, and in total &quot;Ah&quot; of the life surrounding you. This is the film of our time.
6304082428|5.0|I normally dislike seeing movies twice and thus have never felt the need to own a film on tape, but this version of Pride and Predjudice was EXTRAORDINARY - amazingly perfect with incredibly gifted actors, strong screenplay adaptation, and the most beautiful scenary ever. I have never seen two characters on film with more spark and chemistry than between Colin Firth's Darcy and Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth. Be warned though, that you may become completely (and for me uncharacteristically) obsessed with Mr. Darcy and by default, Colin Firth. The only quibble I have is the same as that of many other reviewers - once the two finally got together at the end I wish the filmmakers had extended the story a bit more, but that's the way Jane Austen ended it so I guess the film had to as well. Still, one can't help wishing for some sort of a sequel to this film with the same actors, writer and director. Tip: There is a book called &quot;The Making of Pride and Predjudice&quot; which gives really good insights into the characters, especically Mr. Darcy. I found it facinating to read about the hidden motivations and feelings as interpreted by Colin Firth and especially, Andrew Davies, the screenwriter. Really good.  I told you I was obsessed (!)
B0000248L0|5.0|This album has all the elements that a progressive metal fan would expect. Although &quot;thrashy&quot;, as Annihilator likes to be, this is a masterpiece that no-one should miss. Guitar works, dynamics and tempo changes are very impressive in this release. This album follows the style of the first one (Alice In Hell), but it deserves five stars, since it is at the same time mature and powerful, elegant and aggressive, majestic and full of mystery. &quot;The Fun Palace&quot; is one of the biggest pieces that Annihilator has deployed during its existence. It has a lot of abrupt changes and rhythmical experimentation, with many original riffs and solos. &quot;Imperiled Eyes&quot; is on the same wave, with guitar harmonies and melodies looking for a contemporary sound, instead of a classical one.

B0000248L0|5.0|This album has all the elements that a progressive metal fan would expect. Although &quot;thrashy&quot;, as Annihilator likes to be, this is a masterpiece that no-one should miss. Guitar works, dynamics and tempo changes are very impressive in this release. This album follows the style of the first one (Alice In Hell), but it deserves five stars, since it is at the same time mature and powerful, elegant and aggressive, majestic and full of mystery. &quot;The Fun Palace&quot; is one of the biggest pieces that Annihilator has deployed during its existence. It has a lot of abrupt changes and rhythmical experimentation, with many original riffs and solos. &quot;Imperiled Eyes&quot; is on the same wave, with guitar harmonies and melodies looking for a contemporary sound, instead of a classical one.

B0000508U6|2.0|I don't understand the fascination with this band.  I have read all of the rave reviews calling Coldplay &quot;atmospheric&quot;, &quot;beautifully tender&quot;, &quot;touching&quot;, blah, blah, blah.  I must be missing something because this album is BORING.<br />I can normally listen to and enjoy atmospheric music or more tempered rock music with original sound twists, but this is neither.  This is simply Oasis at a slow pace.  It has neither the atmospheric tones of Radiohead or the sorrowful guitar riffs on some of the Pumkins more relaxed tunes (See &quot;Spaceboy&quot; - Siamese Dream).  The album comes close at times, but it's just missing a certain element to push it into the territory that these critics want to place it in.  Perhaps the album drones on too much without enough variety between songs.  If you suffer from insomnia I would suggest you chew some valerian root and listen to this album for 30 minutes.

B000002H6C|5.0|Everything just comes together on this one. Huge, operatic, tough, intense, complex and ignore the people who say the sound is bad - they are high. It's crisp and in your face. I suspect that the majority of these riffs were culled from Cliff Burton's tapes after his death (even if he is only credited with 1 track) since the band just turned into a 3rd rate bar band after this recording. I can't think of anyone who took metal further after this (with maybe the exception of fantomas...).
B000056NX4|2.0|Having seen the newest stage show in London with Glenn Carter in the title role, I was expecting great things from this video. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. Carter's voice is truly magnificent, and the music is as strong as ever, but the supporting cast, I feel, rather let the side down. The set is a bit amateurish looking,the cast devoid of emotion and passion(except for Glenn) and Pilate? What's he all about? He constantly sounded like he had severe digestive problems, and really spoilt the whole thing for me. As I said, the music is as emotive as ever, but for the real essence of the power of the songs and score, go for the vastly superior movie version.
B00000FCBC|3.0|Skip disc 1 which is basically the \\"new\\" metallica doing their new loungemetal versions of mostly garbage (bob seger? come on...) But disc 2 gives a nice glimpse at where this band originally came from and where they got inspiration for their best stuff.
6305807086|4.0|I sometimes wonder what the point is in buying videos of movies you're only really going to watch once or twice. Why not save the shelf space and get a rental copy? Then along comes an amazing film like Being John Malkovitch and I realise that I could watch this again and again without ever getting bored. <br />Great performances, an utterly original storyline, weird, infectious humour and a unique atmosphere - what more could you want? (unless you like car chases and explosions, in which case you've clicked to the wrong web page).<br />My favourite scenes are John Malkovich visiting the inside of his own head and the documentary section where Malkovich, possessed, leaves off film acting and transforms himself into a celebrated puppeteer. <br />Twisted and unmissable.
0152023984|5.0|I read this book over and over when I was little, and read it still now that I am grown.  I even used an excerpt from it for a speech when I was on the speech team in high school.  It has so many different lessons that can be useful to all of us.  A great story, and great real-life insight.  One of my all-time favorite books.
0446672653|5.0|it was really coincidence that made me buy this book. i found in it a rivetting romance in which a modern day psychiatrist plays the role of a cosmic match maker.being a healer myself ifound myself awestruck.dr.weiss' style of writng being so pellucid &amp;clear ireally loved it.goes to prove love is forever.subsequently i read all of dr. weiss' books.i would never have believed it personally if it wasnt written by an authentic source.a book to be  kept at every home.
6304458894|4.0|....and isn't that the POINT?? I was nine when the MARS ATTACKS cards came out, and being a BIG Jack Davis (Funny Valentines/Wacky Plaks) fan, and having cut my teeth at seven in the Rio Theater, Saint Louis, MO on \\"Invasion of the Saucer Men\\" (YES they were under my bed when I got home with Dad!), I simply HAD to buy a pack! I can smell the wrapper, taste the gum to this day. I can also take you to the schoolyard behind East Richmond Elementary and to the spot where the trash can used to be. I THREW THE CARDS AWAY before I got home and Mom caught me with them or found one in a jeans pocket in the dirty laundry! The cards' spirit lives on in the movie! At the theater, where I previewed the flick to determine WHY Tim didn't necessarily want my prepubescent sons to see it, I was moved.... to tears of wonder (saucers through space/opening credits), tears of joy (Elfman's Hermannesque score), and tears of hysteria (Annette Bening's dead-on AA scene). I was shocked by the JFK/Martin Short bits, revolted by the BeeGee's trailer scene, and outraged by the blasphemy of Tom Jones. My patriotic sensibilities were stung time and again (I am a VietNam and Desert Storm Veteran) . . . .\\"\\"Nevertheless\\"\\", I marvelled at the perfect pacing (Martians preparing for final assault: manning the robot, \\"to arms!\\", etc.), the great color (autopsy scene) and perfect special effects. I voted it my favorite movie -with reservations- of 1996 and just bid on another silver saucer toy ..!  . . .When it came time to watch the ... VHS, I only invited my sons (NO GIRLS ALOUD!), ages 7 and 9, who had seen my muted/sanitized version of \\"THE MASK\\" already. I told them to prepare for something like that, and we had a BALL! I fast-forwarded the fornicators and muted the Lord's name. We had a BALL! Would recommend a parental review and discretionary viewing with the BOYS ONLY. After all, Isn't Tim Burton one of us?
0345442989|4.0|Bottom line: This book was very good.  I enjoyed it from the first word to the very last word.  If you have read any of Luceno's other works and you enjoyed them, think about picking up a copy of &quot;Cloak of Deception.&quot;  The story does an excellent job of explaining all the details that caused the actions of people in Episode 1.  I highly recommend this enthralling book.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Sell-outs? No.  I've seen reviews that wanted an album like their old albums and at the same time demand originality.  If they made an album like their old albums, that wouldn't be very original, would it? <BR> THEY ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE!  Music is all about evolution.  And some people are acting like they have become another gooey, repetitive boy band.  They have great lyrics and most of the songs retain traces of their roots except now they have matured a little.  Come on, guys, change is not a crime against humanity.  And Green Day just showed exactly how original and individual they were by stepping out a little.
0060264306|5.0|I was in search of a good story to read aloud to my five year old daughter who loves books.  To me, the obvious choice was Little House in the Big Woods, a book I associate with my own mother reading to me.  This book was a fabulous choice.  My daughter and I both looked forward to reading a chapter or two each night.  This book sparked her interest in a time long ago, she is now constantly wondering if Laura and Mary had faucets and if they had Barbies.  She has learned to appreciate what we have now, while also appreciating the beauty and joy of a simpler life.  Laura and Mary are excellent role models for her.  While they are children with spirit, they also mind their parents.  This book has given her imagination a boost too for we all now pretend to be the Ingalls family.  I highly recommend this book (and the rest of the series) to all parents of young children.  It is perfect read aloud material for it holds a great story, with many moral lessons for our children.
B000002P2W|5.0|I don't suppose I can realistically argue that WHO BY NUMBERS is the best Who LP.  It's really not on the same level as QUADROPHENIA, WHO'S NEXT or LIVE AT LEEDS.<br />But WHO BY NUMBERS may be my favorite Who LP.  It's Townshends most personal, most initmate group effort.  While it has never made me want to hold a lighter over my head or play air guitar, it does touch me in a way no other Who record can do.<br />Critics love to say the album was Townshend's first 'mid-life crisis' LP. That's more than a tad absurd, considering Townshend was still a good 15 years shy of mid-life.  WHO BY NUMBERS has more to do with Townshend's increasing concern that he was losing himself in drink and celebrity.  The album is a cry for intimacy in a world Townshend increasingly saw as hollow and transparent; he finds himself, as he wrote years earlier, Alone In A Crowd.  The audience and the generation that Townshend always tried so hard to connect with seemed to be further removed from him all the time.  On &quot;However Much I Booze&quot; he sings:<br />&quot;You at home can easily decide what's right by glancing very breifly at the songs I write, but it don't help me that you know, there still ain't no way out.&quot;<br />For all the talk of Townshend's bow to Punk on WHO ARE YOU and his great solo LP EMPTY GLASS, he seems to have had a premonition of the movement on this 1975 album, writing in &quot;They Are All In Love&quot;:<br />&quot;Goodbye all you punks, stay young and stay high.  Hand me checkbook and I'll crawl off to die.  Like a woman in childbirth, grown ugly in a flash, I've seen magic and pain, now I'm recycling trash.&quot;<br />The songs on WHO BY NUMBERS are witty, caustic, confessional, and, in several cases--&quot;They Are All In Love,&quot; &quot;Blue Red And Grey&quot;--downright pretty.  There are two quirky little hits here, &quot;Slip Kid&quot; and &quot;Squeeze Box,&quot; but the non-hits, including Entwistle's great &quot;Success Story,&quot; are far better.
B00004Z400|5.0|ok.so maybe White Pony is a little softer than the past two albums but that doesn't at all make it bad.Lead vocalist Chino Moreno does a great job singing and the new band member who plays the scratches makes Deftones alittle experimental.Good songs are &quot;Digital Bath&quot;,&quot;Back To School&quot;,&quot;Passenger&quot;(which features Maynard James Keenan from Tool.)This disc is essential for your collection.
0790743132|5.0|Bogart portrays one of the grandest attitude adjustments in cinematic history: he's tough, he cries, he kills, he loves, he is just flat out heroic. Ingrid Bergman is stunning, absolutely gorgeous, even her voice is sexy, and Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, all playing classic characters.<br />The Nazi's are slimey and even the most anti-Gallic viewer will get a lump in their throat when the French national anthem drowns at &quot;Deutchland Uber Alles.&quot;<br />Try to count how many scenes in this film have become American cultural icons, imitated and parodied now for nearly 60 years.
630027179X|4.0|I love fantasy more than any genre, and this is one of the most spectaculare and realistic version of King Arthur out there.  The cinamatography is excellent, and the battles are vary realistic with out getting out of control like Brave Heart.  The movie does contain some nudity so parents should watch out before letting the kids watch.
6302054982|4.0|GOODFELLAS is fantastic, kind of like THE GODFATHER with the veneer stripped off to reveal what the modern mafia is really all about.<br />The performances are flawless--I wish Deniro had been on screen more, because he is just so fantastic in this part--and the script, while not something you'd want to read to your mother, is great.  The direction is superb--the long tracking shot, following Henry Hill from his car, threw the kitchen, and to his table at a nightclub, is amazing.<br />But I wish Scorsese had found a way to pick up the pace o the last 30 minutes.  Once Henry goes into the witness protection program, the film flags a bit.
6304385668|1.0|YES!  At last, a phenomenal movie on the great Irish hero!  What a shame historical accuracy played little or no part in the portrayal of his British opponents.  Seens of Anglo-Saxon butchery and the torture of an IRA terrorist who actually died of old age dozens of years later add this film to a long line of quasi-historical anti-English bunkum Hollywood has churned out in recent years... Braveheart, Titanic, The Patriot etc etc.
6302413931|5.0|Quite possibly the greatest film of all time, APOCALYPSE NOW was sniggered at in pre-reviews and, upon release, dismissed as &quot;really wierd&quot; by one prominent film critic in my area.<br />Van Gogh wasn't recognized during his time, either.<br />For all the trouble Coppola had bringing his masterpiece to the screen (documented in a fantastic documentary, HEARTS OF DARKNESS) including star Martin Sheen having a heart attack and the Marco's continually repossessing helicopters to fight Philipine rebels, the final product is an amazing amalgom of war film, psychological introspection, and updating of &quot;Heart Of Darkness.&quot;<br />This film works on every level.  I consider it the absolute pinnacle of filmmaking. I simply cannot recommend it highly enough.
079213690X|2.0|There's no denying the film itself is a ripping yarn, rousing and exciting - as well as at times brutal and downright gorey - from beginning to end.  However, it's lack of historical accuracy and the fact it's so nauseatingly and ridiculously anti-English throughout detract from the overall film....
0783222955|5.0|An amazing film.  The AFI ranking, 34th, is absurd.  This is easily one of the 10 best American films ever made.<br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD does the impossible: makes a family film out of an unflinching look at racism and a rape trial.  That is, I suppose, what makes it so powerful: it walks the line behind the lazy summer days of Jem and Scout's childhood, and the hard truths of their father's courtroom drama.  TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD brings back the joys and the pains of childhood more accurately than any film I've ever seen.<br />Gregory Peck plays an unforgettable Atticus Finch, and all of the supporting players, including the children, are great.  Elmer Berstein's soundtrack is superb.
6305897786|4.0|this movie certainly is worth watching, although I believe the movie is one of these which lose its grip if you watch them for a second time - or even for a third or fourth. as you might suppose from this - rent it or borrow it from a friend, but don't buy it. johnny depp is excellent, i only watched the movie because i admire depp's acting  very much, but good acting - even if there is something natural about the way depp acts in his movies - is not enough to make this a view-again-movie. the script is excellent, the story gripping and absolutely thrilling, but the plot does not feature hardboiled action or something like that - the action of this movie takes place on a more intellectual, more mind-stimulationg sub-level beneath the surface of ordinary blood-n-guts-thrills. i wont go as far as saying this flick will be boring when watching for the second time, but i believe, it will totally lack the interesting, gripping aura surrounding itself when watching for the first time, because this movie just is based on elementary subjects of horror that grow stale if repeated.  i only saw this movie once and i am satisfied with it, although the ending seemed to me to be an easy way to stick to a vulgar 2 hour flick - instead of trying to close the circle of the story. to me, that's the only miserable part about this movie which is -otherwise - a must see movie.
6301963911|5.0|ANNIE HALL isn't Allen's greatest film--that would be MANHATTAN--but his warmest, his most approachable, his most inventive, and probably my favorite.<br />What's most amazing about Allen's most creative period is the realism of his characters.  They aren't the static, two-dimensional characters you find in most Hollywood productions, who stay the same from beginning to end.  Allen's characters actually learn something from their experiences, actually grow and mature by the end of a film.
0804106304|4.0|My daughter had to read this for her summer reading last year and I got the chance to pick it up first :)<br />I enjoyed so much about this story, even though the writing was a bit simplistic, I related not only to the mothers, but to the daughter as well.  I felt all the needs of a mother to want only the best for her daughter by trying to teach her lessons that she has already learned, and all the frustrations of the daughters who undoubtedly thought they knew better.  The stories of the mother's pasts were heartbreaking, the goals of the daughter's, inspiring, the lessons in Chinese culture more than  interesting.  This book pulled on my heart strings.  If you're a Mom, you will really enjoy this, even with the complicated relationships, if you have a daughter, give it to her to read, she will understand how very special being a daughter is and how very much we want for our daughters.<br />Enjoy!  Debbi
6300216365|5.0|A great film on it's own, PLAY IT AGAIN SAM also lays the groundwork for Allen's two best films, ANNIE HALL and MANHATTAN.<br />A film based on a play that was based on standup routines, PLAY IT AGAIN SAM shows off two Allen favorites, Tony Roberts and the great Diane Keaton.<br />Allen and Keaton's prescription-drug rap comparisons are classic, and the final scene is amazing.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Really. What is left to say at this point? Some say that Requiem is nothing more then an overrated NC-17 (or R) rated after school special about drugs. In some ways, yes it is that. Some say that it's a masterpiece adapted from a masterpiece. In some ways it's that. I personally feel that it is one of the most powerful films to come out in recent years. Aronofsky has crafted this film so well that you feel for these characters. This is not a movie that you go into hoping to see big explosions and gunfights and other elements it seems to take to have a box office sucess. This is a film that grabs your heart and rips it out. How can you not feel for Ellen Burnstyn's oscar winning performance as Sara?(*note* I don't acknowlege Julia Roberts as the oscar winner.) She could be your mother or even grandmother. True, Jared Leto's Harry isn't completely fleshed out as much as some would hope, but it doesn't matter, Leto's acting ability makes up for the lack of character. The same holds true with Marlon Wayans. When I first heard that Wayans was in it, I was skeptical. I really don't like anything he's starred in. But when I saw his performance, my jaw hit the floor. HE CAN ACT!! Not only that, HE CAN ACT VERY WELL!!! It's a shame that he doesn't do these type of films more often. Finally, Jennifer Connelly's Marion....my God, her fate is possible the second most depressing in the film (of course, Burnstyn's character has the worst fate in my opinion.) Should you see it? Yes. Will you like it? I'm not sure. Does it deserve to be a classic? Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes.
0792106989|4.0|John Ford hits on all cylinders, Lee Marvin plays a classic bad guy, and John Wayne plays the stereotypical John Wayne character in a very non-stereotypical manner in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE.<br />Wayne plays the same basic character he'd played in so many other westerns.  But, instead of being the young stud settling the Wild West, Wayne plays an aging dinasaur, his kind of justice increasingly unwanted and outdated.  Easily Wayne's best performance.<br />Stewart and Miles are good, though a bit of the lovey-dovey glazed looks could have been edited out, as far as I'm concerned.  <br />To me the best performance here comes from Lee Marvin.  His Liberty Valance is a dirty, slimey, bullying psychopath.  Brilliantly done.<br />But who decided to give the bad guy a goofy name like Liberty Valance?  Sounds like an 18th century piece of furniture.
B00003CXN4|5.0|It must have been hard to show the complexities of the world of drugs and drugs trafficking without wimping out and coming around to simplistic generalities and easy solutions. One strength of this film is that it doesn't reveal any one answer to the problem of drugs. What it does do is show the difficulty in enforcing the law and keeping tabs on drug users and sellers. It also shows how even those who consider themselves untouchable (like the U.S Drug Czar, played with admirable restraint by Michael Douglas) are just as vulnerable as those who seem easier prey for the drug pushers. When Douglas's daughter slowly becomes addicted to drugs, for instance, he doesn't find out until it is almost too late.    There is so much fine acting in this movie that I'd be hard-pressed to choose one performance as being better than another.  Benicio Del Toro gives the performance of his career and, Catherine Zeta-Jones is absolutely superb as a drug lord's wife forced to cope with the threat of financial ruin when her husband is suddenly imprisoned. Her obvious pregnancy makes her seem especially vulnerable, especially desperate for security. There are few truly moral or idealistic characters in this movie but I found myself rooting for many of them, anyway. You're likely to come away from this one with a new view of the drug marketplace and the way it affects us all, whether we think about it or not.
B00005BL2A|1.0|I had yet to experience a music let down like \\"Exciter\\" since I bought The Cure's \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" album.  Depeche Mode has always been praised for bringing forth new sounds that please fans of old in adition to giving birth to the next wave of Depeche Mode virgins.  The release of Exciter has been anything but exciting.  After previewing 3 songs at a listening station I should have gone home and washed my ears out for ear mites, but not before asking a store clerk if there had been some mix up regarding the Exciter Cd I thought I scanned.        Not to sound over critical, but the music on the album isn't the only thing lacking.  The album cover seemed dull and I pity the mall rat that wastes the gas money their parents gave them to buy a cd or t-shirt of this so called Exciter album.  Depeche Modes eclectic sounds of rock and keyboard are not present at all on this album.  In adition to the rock/techno-pop elements of Depeche Mode, I've always enjoyed their softer ballad style songs which any attempt to recreate them on this album has fallen short.  Ron Jerome movies have more passion than this album.  If you've already bought this album maybe you could suppliment your collection of AOL disk and use your Exciter cd as a coaster.  In fact you could leave a dirty cup on it and not have to look at the nasty image thats trying ever so hard to look abstract in a simplistic organic nature.

B000002W5J|5.0|1967 was a seminal year for rock and roll music - with the release of The Doors's debut album, Sgt. Pepper's by The Beatles, and Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow. (Of course, there were many others, but these are most prominent.) Jefferson Airplane defined &quot;the San Francisco sound&quot; along with Janis Joplin and The Greatful Dead (and LSD-25!). This is a superb album; one of the very best of the 60's. I can't say any more than any other reviewer has, but for me, I almost feel as if I've transcended to San Francisco in the late 60's when listening to this album. &quot;Somebody To Love&quot; is the anthem of the 1960's as far as I'm concerned. A definitive, psychedelic album of the era. A must have!!
0441172717|5.0|Dune, Frank Herbert's Masterpiece, is a Literary Achievment, and, in my opinion, the greatest Science Fiction Novel of all time.  Set in the future, this novel covers themes ranging from politics to economics, religion and philosphy to environmentalism.  In other words, Herbert is a genius and you will be able to tell this within the first few pages.  <br />The central theme is that of messianic religions, and the effects of such.  Because of the fact that Paul Attredies (the main character) is a messiah, we get to see his point of view on being one.  Herbert deals extensively with the feelings such a person might feel about having a fate which is unaviodable.  <br />The characters Herbert created are outstanding.  You'll hate the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and love Paul.  You'll be intrigued by the guildsmen and in awe of the Bene Geseritt.  <br />If you like dense plots, this is the book for you.  There are more layers to this novel than you can count on both hands.  I should warn you that you will miss many many things after the first reading.  I recently finished reading it for the third time and I was still discovering new themes,new ideas. IF you have not yet read it, Dune is a Masterpiece and should be a part of your collection.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This CD is great, but what makes it only good is because it is missing some of the greatest beatles songs out there. This is a must have for all Beatles fans in the world. Highly recomended.
6305807086|4.0|Being John Malkovich has the most original premise I have come across in some time.  Fortunately, it also has a talented cast that plays it straight, proving that the small laughs can be the best.  John Cusack is great, as always - this time around he plays a somewhat disgusting little &quot;artist&quot; slacker, and he gets the arrogance and the downtrodden effect just right.  The scenes where he initially tries to woo the sultry Catherine Keener are almost painfully funny.  The success of this movie lies in large part with John Malkovich himself, who is not only gracious enough to lend himself to the premise, but who is subjected time and again to humiliating little potshots that provide some of the film's funniest moments (&quot;Malkovich, think fast!&quot;).  The first half of the movie is definitely the best, as the viewer is placed in one delightfully bizarre scenario after another, and the Maxine character ultimate bogs the whole thing down a little (What does she want?  Why keep torturing Craig and Lotte?  I think she is narcissistic enough to want herself in a man's body...).  This is a great movie for those who are kind of burned out on movies, in that it shows that there are still some good ideas out there waiting to be discovered.
B00005B36H|2.0|A much better band before they could afford 10,000 hours of studio time. Overproduced, meandering and lacking that hair-raising Tool crunch of old. Hooks are sparse, crescendos abandoned, more and more like Yes every album. MJK isn't into it anymore, and it shows; there's enough dull introspection on this one to fill 2 Perfect Circle records. Take me back to Undertow for the love of god. Yeah great cover.
B000002UTK|5.0|the first 4 songs are brilliant    discography is probably their best intro cd, but if you already like them i think you'll really like this
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|First of all, if you want this album first of all see the movie it is writeen for, Dancer in the Dark.  It is one of the best movies i have ever seen and will blow you away.  This is another reason that proves Bjork is a genius.  This soundtrack brought me right back to the magic of the movie.  I've Seen it All is a duet with Thom Yorke (from the best band ever, Radiohead), and it is really great.  There are only 7 tracks and only 30 minutes long, but still leaves you satisfied.  Every time you hear one of the songs, you know exactly when it happened in the movie.  I hate most musicals, but definately see Dancer in the Dark and then buy the soundtrack.  Bjork is a genius.  Its just as simple as that.  if this review was helpful, click the icon below this review.  thanks!
B00005J73X|5.0|Bon Jovi is the greatest rock band that ever lived and this is a great CD. If you are a fan or striving to be then this is the CD for you!! All the greats live!! Who could ask for more!! As long as they keep rockin' then I wil keep right on buying their music!!! All the songs are great I just wish like everyone else that it had more of them but it still rocks!
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool's 3rd LP, 4th overall album.  Great album, showing their evolution from the 6 track Opiate EP through Undertow and AEnima, to their current state (Lateralus).  <br />You can even see this in the way the video for their first single, 'Schism', was done.  With the stop action/claymation filming of Prison Sex, Sober, and portions of Aenema, and the live action of Stinkfist, portions of Sober, and portions of Aenema, you have a good mix of all the elements of their former videos (minus 'Hush', their first and only video in which the band appears [outside of clips from Sober]).<br />Lateralus starts off with 'The Grudge', a track clocking in at over 8 and a half minutes, it's a mixture of Justin's new use of a cleaner sound, Adam's chunky riffs, Danny's unique drumming style (the guy is sponsored by Sonor for Pete's Sake), and Maynard's screaming lyrics.<br />After segue track, you're thrown into The Patient, a track with a tantalizing intro that sucks you on--then, later in the song, you're struck with heavy-hitting riffs, with the last 2 minutes sounding agressive...yet, reassuring.  (Though you know the lyrics are prob'ly otherwise--I'll let you listen to'em and find out.)<br />Then, after another segue, you have their first single:  Schism.  The riff of this song is astounding.  Unfortunately, I've heard that they cut out the intro to this on the radio (it's before the opening bass riff--if you don't know what I'm talking about, then they cut it out).  Another aspect of Tool that is show is when the bass and guitar are following the main riff, when they go into a sudden power-chord driven portion of the song.<br />I'll leave the rest of this album up to you to find out.  With it clocking in at 78 minutes and 58 seconds, there's a lot more to listen to and a lot more to talk about.  One of the best albums of the year, and another masterpiece from a band that's all about the music.
0385043805|5.0|I was forced to read this book in one of my litature classes my sophomore year in college.  I thought it looked horrible and sounded worse.  I was so wrong.  It is simply wonderful.  I got completely lost in the story and the lives of all the characters.  Now, almost four years later, I still find myself randomly thinking about the story and the people.  It is one of the few stories that is timeless.  It is unususal for me to like this kinds of book.  I noramlly like adventures in far off, fantastic places.  This book is not that.  It is a good mistery, but more than anything, it is just a perfect example of story telling.  Every word and detail is perfet for the overall effect.  This is a must for ANY book lover's collection.
0380788624|5.0|Stephenson combines his typically quirky characters with fascinating background stories about everything from decoding enemy messages during WWII to keeping present day high tech information safe from hacking. Weaving various tales together, he brings them skillfully into one narrative, a complex story spanning more than half a century and several continents.  Unlike some of Stephenson's books, this one doesn't grow too long-winded and you grow quite fond of the characters. Better yet, the plots do actually tie together before you lose all interest in what happens.  I would put this on my list of the best books to take with you when you're going to be stranded on a desert island.  Not only is it dense enough to be read several times, but it is also strangely hopeful.
0140074317|5.0|I just finished this book, and the end of it gave me chills up and down my spine! The plot is everything I look for in a story, and I recommmend it for people of all ages. Although I just finished it 5 minutes ago, I am inclined to pick it up and start reading it all over again! The author uses such detail on things that I can picture them perfectly in my mind. I hope you get the chance to read this book.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Many people were very quick to dismiss this album when it first came out.  The album was one of their worst-selling to date, and the tour wasnt that great either.  But this is a very solid album, with some really good tracks!  Discotheque has a great rhythm and has a great guitar riff, too.  Its something different for U2, a departure from their earler stuff.  of course there is Staring at the Sun, which is a great song too.  But i think the best song on the album is &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot;.  When i saw the elevation tour, i was disappointed that they didnt play this gem.  It sounds like the perfect song to do at a u2 concert, and they didnt.  Actually they didnt play anything from this album.  Apparently, they are ashamed of this album but there is no reason that they should be.  I am a big fan of the electronic U2; i think that when they were electronic was when they were at their experimental peak.  It is especially evident on this album. Easily U2's most under rated album, along with Zooropa.<br />if this was helpful, click the icon below. Thanks!
B00000IP2L|5.0|Zakk Wylde is a &quot;Miracle Man&quot; when it comes to guitar driven heavy metal.  This is one of my all time favorite albums.  Zakk is without a doubt one of the premier axe gods of our day.  On this album he displays a very diverse style going from all out speed &quot;Bored To Tears&quot; and &quot;Lost My Better Half&quot; to the ballad &quot;Spoke In The Wheel&quot;.   As for the vocal work, it is nothing less than spectacular.  If you liked anything Zakk did with Ozzy, you will love the BLS.  Be sure to check out Pride and Glory, and Zakk's Book of Shadows as well as BLS's Stronger Than Death.  <br />SDMF
B00005A1PR|5.0|I took a chance when I bought this CD after only hearing the first single, &quot;Video&quot;. I am so pleased with my purchase. India.Arie represents everything that I respect in music artists...they can write their own music and play their own instruments. Another thing that is uncommon about this CD is that the Intro, Interlude, and Outro are actually good songs. Before I bought this album, I told a friend how I hated when R&amp;B albums had intros, but I can actually sing along with the one on this CD. And the thing that I think is the best feature of India.Arie is that she doesn't wail and cry and scream when she sings...she sings simply, and that is something rare with female musicians/singers these days. I absolutely love this album and I eagerly await India's next album! Buy this CD!!!

B0000028M7|5.0|DIRT is as close to perfection as an album could possibly be.  &quot;Them Bones&quot;, &quot;Rooster&quot;, &quot;God Smack&quot; and my favorite, &quot;Angry Chair&quot;, are some of the best AIC songs.  Not only that, but they're probably some of the best songs of 90'S ROCK!  A must have for any Alice in Chains or grunge fan.
B000002U6E|2.0|&quot;The Eyes of Truth&quot;, which is used in the award winning Matrix theatrical trailer, is a truly incredible piece of music, but oddly it's the only track I can listen to without cringing a little bit.  I don't like the undeveloped, late '80s sounding classic-rock-like English lyrics. In fact, there's just far too much singing in general.  I thought this was going to be mostly instrumental, which it isn't.  There's also these improvisational guitars used at times that also sound like classic rock.  If you can't tell already, I'm not a big fan of classic rock.  There's also the clich&eacute;d overuse of those flute instruments again, that are essentially the contrived mark of Enigma.  Many of the real world sounds are actually synthesized, for some reason, like the piano.  Overall, the production is very euphonic and of a high quality.  However, I prefer the more original &amp; varied sampling, predominantly instrumental, and non-classic rock sound of more electronica-oriented disks like Delirium's Semantic Spaces.  I guess I should have just bought the single...
B000056K04|3.0|The thing i like the most about the dave matthews band is its great use of different instuments and long, epic-like songs.  On this album, of course, you wont find it here.  And i was very disappointed.  Dave Matthews has been on his long and steady downfall ever since Before these Crowded Streets, which was still a good effort.  But there are few great standout tracks on this album, and it sounds almost like they are selling out.  Their diversity is what made them great and it seems as if they are throwing it all away.  Glen Ballard is a fine producer, and some chemistry is there, but it just doesnt sound like Dave Matthews.  It will appeal to the mainstream and is still the biggest one-week selling album of the year, but that doesnt make it great.  On the other hand, there are a few standout tracks;  The Space Between was my favorite song on the album even before rock radio picked it up.  The whole album isnt as complex as it used to be.  Is Dave Matthews losing his touch?????<br />if this review was helpful, click the icon below.  THANKS!
B00005ASHM|5.0|People tend to take the beach boys for granted, feeling that they are now a pathetic, tired, touring, surfing band, who had a few hits back in the sixties.  I find this really sad.  Im not the biggest beach boy fan (by no means), but this album right here changed rock music....You think the Beatles Sgt Pepper's changed music? Yea, it did; but if it wasn't for the classic PET SOUNDS album, the great Revolver and Sgt Pepper albums wouldn't have ever existed.  Meticulously and beautifully crafted by lead singer, bassist, pianist, producer, and genius, Brian Wilson, this album combines extremely deep lyrical themes for that time period, combined with a great backing musical soundtrack. Every song on here rates from excellent to classic. The emotional depth in the music of this album, is so ahead of its time.  But this is a surfing band!! Making a great album isnt possible for them!!...Well, the Beach Boys proved me (and if you listen to this album), you wrong.  Every song on here is a beauty.  The true standouts on the original 13 track album are &quot;Wouldn't it be nice&quot;, &quot;Don't talk(Put your head on my shoulder)&quot; ,&quot;I'm waiting for the day&quot;, &quot;Lets Go Away For Awhile&quot;, &quot;Sloop John B.&quot;, &quot;God Only Knows&quot;.....crap, im going to name every song from the whole album!!  The only negative about the album is a dated sound, because of the mono recording method Brian Wilson used; but after a few listens to the great musical intricacies of this album, you will see why i am praising it so much....believe me, if you like great music, this is a must buy; you wont be disappointed!!
0060977264|5.0|Dear readers, I read the book &quot;By The River Piedra I sat down and wept. I think it is a wounderful story of love the two protagonist, Pilar and her love show their feeling and fight to recover their great love that started from their childhood. I recommend this book because is a special story of love.
0446605409|4.0|John Corey has all the characteristics of a great detective! Witty, charming, sarcastic, and intelligent.  I wouldn't want to go up against him.  When I first started reading, I was not interested in &quot;scientists&quot; (no offense) but, Nelson Demille never ceases to capture my attention!! Mr Demille drips just enough  information at each turn of the page to keep you reading.  I was impressed that the historical facts were not twisted as are many other fictional books. I finished this book in one evening.  When it ended, I gasped. What a shocking finish.  This book needs a sequel!!
B00003CXP1|5.0|Why won't most people like this movie?  Because people don't like what they can't understand or refuses to understand.  They'll see this movie and object to what happens and not really care about what it's trying to say...It was great to see a film using many different kinds of shots/media. The split-screen was used very effectively and not so mush as to be annoying; a difficult thing to pull off. It was also refreshing to see a movie which ventured away from traditional and \\"safe\\" film techniques, i.e., rule of thirds, complimentary coloring, mono-coloring... Not to say that there wasn't any, but this film tries everything.  Even better than the very artistic visuals were the story/message/questions the movie communicated... most via expressions, pain, and drugs rather than words.  This movie must be experienced and processed.  Most of the American(christian) populus wouldn't get anything from a movie about [this subject]...but the movie parallels a junkie son and his junkie-in-the-making mother.  The audience is more understanding and sympathetic for the mother, and hopefully realizes that she and her son are not too unlike.  And if you already do know something/anything about good movies, you're probably thinking this movie couldn't possible be good if it stars Marlon Wayans, who should be hung for feeding Scary Movie to American teenagers.  BUT, he has somehow redeemed himself, thanks to his part in the movie. I was also going to go on and on about how the music was great and was just as integral to the entire movie as story and art, but I'll get off my soapbox and hope you buy this movie that the majority of this narrow-minded society would label as quote-unquote weird.  <br />..something that the New Your Post wouldn't call a \\"Thrill-ride\\" or \\"The year's best Feel-Good movie.\\"
B00005BL2A|2.0|I've had the album for well over a week at this point and I've listened to it constantly in an attempt to find that redeeming aspect that all Depeche Mode albums have had for me.  Unfortunately, this one doesn't have it.  An album where nearly all of the songs sound derivative, albeit with better production, of the more forgettable songs from past albums like the last half of 'Ultra', 'Get Right With me' from SOFAD, and 'Blue Dress' and 'Waiting For The Night to Fall' from 'Violator', 'Exciter' left the excitement somewhere else.
0780020685|5.0|This movie is a classic tale.  It works on every level, Characters, Plot, Settings, Storyline, the works.  OK you may not understand the culture of Japan, so parts of the samurai culture may not be clearly understood.  (see the MAGNIFICANT SEVEN if this is an insurmountable problem.) The movie is long and is not the non stop action sold these days.  It is not meant to be.  Each step is a struggle, the coming of the bandits, the decision of the villegers, the search for samurai, the interaction between them and the villagers, and that doesn't cover all of the plots involved.  If you like well plotted stories this movie is for you.  If you like interesting characters this movie is for you.  If you like great performances then this movie is DEFINATELY for you.  Give this picture a chance some rainey weekend and it will be a pleasant and memorable eyeful.
B000002VJH|4.0|This is the funkiest the Grateful Dead had ever gotten in the studio, in my opinion. <br />The slick runs and blistering solos that characterize this album are among the best the Dead have ever recorded. Songs that had become concert standards abound here. The gliding &quot;Help is On the Way,&quot; the tricky &quot;Slipnot!&quot; and the rolling &quot;The Music Never Stopped&quot; all appear here. Also, one of my favorite Dead tunes (and the reason I started listening to them in the first place), &quot;Franklin's Tower&quot; is on this album. Each time &quot;Roll away the dew&quot; is chanted, it gets better and better.<br />Other good tracks include the oddly-metered &quot;Stronger than Dirt&quot; and the Indianesque &quot;Blues for Allah.&quot; There's a little bit of filler here, but not so much that it gets in the way.<br />The jazz influence on this album is very evident. That, combined with the incredible jamming talent of the Dead, makes this their best studio album outside of &quot;American Beauty.&quot; It's true, the Dead are truly a live band, and though much of their studio material seems less powerful, I think a lot of it is retained on this album.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|if you like silly comedies(such as ace ventura 1) this movie is for you. the wayans bros are comedic geniuses! I liked this movie a lot more than road trip.
B00005B36H|5.0|Unlike many of the reviewers of this album, I have never been a Tool fanatic. I found some of Undertow to be okay, but the slower cuts on that CD kind of sucked. The follow-up, considered a masterpiece by many, didn't strike me as such. I found it to be too similar cut-to-cut. If I listed to only one or two songs off that CD I thought the songs were great, but had a hard time listening to the whole CD in one sitting. My ears would get tired. This to me does not make a masterpiece.<br />The new CD, Lateralus, is definitely the best they have made. It has variety of tone, rythmn and mood. I can make it from open to close everytime I put it on. This is Tool's masterpiece. The CD is dominated by the rythmn section. The drumming on this CD is light years ahead of anything on their previous releases and the interplay of the entire band is outragious.<br />I am a long time prog rock fan and can't wait to see Tool blow away King Crimson this summer on tour. King Crimson's current drummer is going to be put to shame. I hope Fripp wakes up an fires the guy.
B000002LFZ|3.0|The old cliche about aural wallpaper is certainly true in the case of Fleetwood Mac.  I don't mean that pejoratively; it's just that songs like 'Don't Stop', 'Go Your own way' and 'As long as you follow' are so familiar, so a part of the air I breathe, from endless playing on the radio, on parents' turntables, in shops etc., that they cease to become mere songs, with a structure expressing emotions - I can't remember a time I didn't know these songs.  But it's not just familiarity - the nakedly insightful lyrics about the joys and difficulties of love tend to get smothered in a warm haze of over-produced country-tinged soft-rock, and a fug of overlayed backing vocals.  It's all very pleasant, but difficult to know how to feel.  Exceptions are the gorgeous 50s pastiche 'Oh Diane', the endearing folly 'Tusk' and the heartwarmingly sincere 'Sara'.
B000059HGY|5.0|On my previous review of TORA TORA TORA I accidently listed Mifune playing Admiral Yamamoto.  That was of course in MIDWAY.  I guess my review deserved less stars than this movie.  But the advice is the same.  Instead of going out to PEARL HARBOR and DINNER.  Get delivery and watch TORA TORA TORA and you will pay less for better entertainment.
0671024256|3.0|King was at his funniest in the beginning when he mentioned yarking as he put it when he ate too many fried eggs as a kid I did feel extremely angry that he was one of those kids that tormented kids like Sandra and others that resembled Carrie White I can understand her and pity her,but I don't find her unlikable. Shame on you Steve. As for his addictions to alchol and drugs,I don't see how his wife put up with him for so long. I would have kicked this lazy,overbearing control freak out on his butt the first thing. Woman must be a saint to put up with that crap.
B00003CXDV|4.0|This movie is alot of fun and the whole family should enjoy it, but the adults will probably find it funnier than the kids will.  Parents will especially appreciate the theme of the obsessed teenager who never goes outside and devotes his entire life to his favorite TV show, as well as the parody of the classic Star Trek series.  Many of the comic sequences are more adult-oriented, but kids will also appreciate it.  Another aspect of the film that classic Trek fans will appreciate is the reference to Crewman #xx, the extra-cast crew member who died in every episode of the series.  A fun family comedy with the parents in mind!
B000050XEI|1.0|Wistful, repetitive, I-need-something-from-which-to-sleep-- stuff. I'm sleepy just thinking 'bout it. Kenny G, wherefore art thou? I forgive you.  I'll take back every nasty thing I said about you. You too Yani. And John Tesh...
B00000JCB2|4.0|Significant Other is a an enjoyable album, as long as you are not too critical of it. Sometimes Freds rapping gets annoying, but not enough for me to call this a bad album. &quot;Just Like This&quot; is a great rock/hiphop song, followed by the 2 best songs, &quot;Nookie&quot; (I did it all for the...) and &quot;Break Stuff.&quot; There are also some more mellow songs on here, most of which are good (ReArranged, No Sex, Dont Go Off Wandering). There are only a few songs I dont like, &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot; is really annoying in my opinion. But overall this album is worth your money, as long as your not too critical and just try to enjoy it.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  Russel Crowe definitely earned his Best Actor award in this movie.  Joaquin Phoenix is also excellent in this movie, his performance was underrated.  The story itself is moving and gripping, you actually feel something for the characters.  Many 'historians' criticise this movie because of the innacurate events that take place in the movie.  It is clearly stated at the end of the movie that it is based on events in history that have been altered, and it is a work of fiction.  <br />Ther story itself does not drag, and is very moving.  Maximus Desimus Meridias, a general in Emperor Marcus Aurrelius' Legion is betrayed when the son of the Emperor finds out that he wants to pass his powers to Maximus when he dies.  Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix) gives an exemplary performance as the son of Marcus, who in jealousy kills his father to prevent him from announcing the passage of power to Maximus.  When Maximus refuses to pledge loyalty to Commodus, he is ordered to be executed, but escapes.  Afterward, a horrific chain of events leaves Maximus with no more than a quest for vengeance, when he is picked up by a slave trader and turned into a Gladiator.  Describing the movie does it no justice.  It must be seen through your eyes to be fully appreciated.  Ridley Scott once again directs a maserpiece.  <br />The acting is great, and this can definitely be the movie that made Russel Crowe.  Joaquin Phoenix also gave a memorable performance, and it was very disappointing not to see him win the award for best supporting actor.  Wonderful movie, do not miss this, whatever you do.  You will NOT be disappointed.
0385501560|4.0|Palahnuik has done it again, for a fourth time.  Usually an author at this point gets bland or switch to another style of writing.  Choke is about Victor Manicini, a sexaholic working in the colonial era trying to find enough money to keep his mom alive, he thinks.  This nearly 300-page book takes us through an adventure of his &quot;science and sadism&quot; to find out the complete truth about his life's purpose.<br />Choke's writing style is still reminiscent of the faithful &quot;Fight Club&quot; and manages to have great power in its symbolism and philosophy.  Like all of Palahnuik's other novels, I placed this book down and sighed muttering, &quot;I'm glad I'm not living like this.&quot;  His emphasis on the epitome of depression and drudgery is haunting.  I honestly don't believe anyone who reads his books, including &quot;Choke&quot;, will look at the world the same as before.<br />Choke is worth all the money.  While I still believe Fight Club is the most riveting and powerful, Choke is  still a great novel to pick, fling through, and appreciate life.
B00003CXN4|5.0|This is one rush hour that you'll want to sit through. Steven Soderbergh's phenomenal Traffic, is a gripping and engaging film that keeps its audience in its gritty trance. The three interwoven stories are fascinating as we learn how the war on drugs affects each of the characters in each story. Without giving way large parts of the film, here are a few tidbits to wet any interested filmgoer's appetite. For Michael Douglas, drugs are eating away at his family; Catherine Zeta-Jones will do anything, and I mean anything, to keep her family together after the sudden arrest of her husband; and Benicio Del Toro just wants to do his job. If your still not sure you want to add Traffic to your library, rent it then decide for yourself. After I rented the film, I went out and bought it that same night. Trust me, it's good stuff!
B000002H33|5.0|That may sound like a pretty bold statement, but just listen to this album and you will see how true it is. Especially for those of you who think that the Black Album, Load and ReLoad are all that matters. Metallica's first 4 albums (Kill Em All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, And Justice For All) show Metallica at their best. In only 8 tracks they've molded an incredible peice of music. Every essential element is present, and it has been perfected to the point where even Metallica can't make it any better. Every song on here is a masterpeice within itself, adding up to an album that an excellence that has never been surpassed. The opening track &quot;Battery&quot; sets the perfect mood for the impending 7 tracks. &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is my personal favorite track on this album (also my second favorite Metallica song, the first being the incredible metal-ballad &quot;One&quot; off of ...And Justice For All), an 8 minute + track with incredible lyrics and music alike. Every song on this album is full of power and depth, &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be,&quot; &quot;Sanitarium,&quot; &quot;Damage Inc,&quot; &quot;Leper Messiah,&quot; and &quot;Disposable Heroes.&quot; &quot;Orion&quot; is an incredible instrumental, really showing off Metallica's instrumental talents (my favorite Metallica instrumental second only to &quot;Call of Ktulu&quot; from Ride the Lightning). If the only Metallica you know is from what you've seen on MTV or heard on the radio, I suggest you check out this and Metallica's other pre-Black album material. Their new material isn't bad, but its sad that by signing to a major label, they lost the freedom to create masterpeices like this.
0380973464|5.0|If you have read any other reviews, you know that this book could have used a more stringent editor, and you know that it is very long. You may also have read that some plot lines disappear, or that some obvious questions remained unanswered by the books ending.<br />All these things are true.<br />However, if you like historical fiction, or action/adventure books, you will probably like this one. I loved the way this book blended strong historical references with fiction, and the way it was woven together with a '90's plotline. I like most of the characters, although they were not written with deep volume. Actually, it is a tribute to the scope and pace of this book that I did not object to the characters that were nothing more than vague outlines.<br />There are some implausibilities, such as, how a group of people, or descendants of this group, so intricately laced together during WW2, could, almost randomly, reunite in the '90s without it becoming obvious to everyone involved.<br />Every book has its flaws. The scope, pace, and subject of this book worked well enough for me to overlook, what, in the end are minor flaws.<br />Stephenson has written a book that is exciting, informative, and suprisingly funny. At times, to me, it was gut-busting-teary-eyed-laugh-out-loud funny (i.e. pages 511-528.)<br />Do not let the size or negative reviews scare you off. Despite the flaws I have mentioned above, this book is worth reading.<br />So Read It.
B000002H6C|5.0|And Justice For All is yet another masterpeice from the greatest metal band ever to exist. Like its precedor, Master of Puppets, Justice defines the word perfection. Every track shows excellent songwriting, instrumental techniques, and every element that makes heavy metal what it is. &quot;Blackened&quot; is an awesome song, as is the title track, &quot;Dyers Eve,&quot; &quot;The Shortest Straw,&quot; &quot;Harvester of Sorrow,&quot; &quot;To Live is to Die,&quot; &quot;Eye of the Beholder,&quot; and &quot;The Frayed Ends of Sanity,&quot; which features a stranely familiar introduction. In other words, every song on this album kicks major ... But there is one track that truly stands out on this album, and is in my mind Metallica's greatest song ever. &quot;One&quot; is a powerful metal-ballad that shows the bands talent like nothing else. It may sound strange, but I am comparing this song to Queens &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody,&quot; in the fact that it incorporates several styles of music into one peice. The intro to One starts off with war sounds in the background: machine guns, explosions, helicopters, until it goes into the instrumental opening, which begins slow, yet edgy. The lyrics are powerful and stunning, yet intelligent and meaningful. WIth both metal and classical influences, the song slowly builds into a faster, more powerful drive, until the final segment which features machine-gun like riffs like nothing any other metal band has ever produced. If you think that Enter Sandman is Metallicas greatest song, check out this album, you'll be in for a suprise.
0671891634|4.0|The book begins at a slow pace and eases into a higher-level analysis of the companies and stocks that Peter Lynch invested in and researched. The perception that everyone may value stocks providing one is prepared to do the homework is emphasised. On the flip side, if you are not prepared to do the homework, rather let an expert assist you... I found the analysis and thoughts of the author to be intriguing.
B00004XOWM|3.0|&quot;Chocolate Starfish&quot; was no doubt a dissapointing album, but I dont think that it is a full let down like so many people here think so. While some of the songs on here are incredible stupd and/or annoying, there are several really strong tracks that make the album somewhat worthwhile. &quot;Hot Dog&quot; is probably the most irritating song on this CD, followed closely by &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; and &quot;My Generation.&quot; Aside from the bombs, though, are a few awesome tracks that keep this CD from sinking. Thi first version of &quot;Rollin&quot; is a really fun, catchy song, even though the lyrics are kinda lame. And probably the best track on this album is the powerful MI:2 theme &quot;Take A Look Around.&quot; Other good songs include &quot;Boiler,&quot; &quot;It'll Be OK,&quot; and &quot;Hold On,&quot; which is the closest thing to a ballad that Limp Bizkit has ever done. You may find this album dissapointing, but for me there were enough good songs to make it worth my money.

B000002H2H|5.0|Just like their debut, Kill Em All, Metallica's Ride the Lightning is another metal masterpeice, full of lightning fast riffs, pounding drums, incredible solos and great songwriting. That slow guitar intro to &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot; is decieving, this album is all heavy metal. &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot; is an awesome song, as is the title track. My favorite is &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls,&quot; but another highlight is the 8 minute+ instrumental &quot;Call of Ktulu,&quot; a masterpeice on every level. There is not a single bad song on this album. If you are a Metallica fan (or just a music fan, for that matter), make sure this album is in your collection.
0671891634|4.0|The book begins at a slow pace and eases into a higher-level analysis of the companies and stocks that Peter Lynch invested in and researched. The perception that everyone may value stocks providing one is prepared to do the homework is emphasised. On the flip side, if you are not prepared to do the homework, rather let an expert assist you... I found the analysis and thoughts of the author to be intriguing.
B000002G23|5.0|From start to finish, the first single through their last studio masterpiece, The Police delivered the goods, live and on record.  Boxsets are usually little more than cash cows for artists who either ran out of original ideas or looking for a quick buck, sometimes both. But when used as a career retrospective, they usually miss someone's favorite tune.  Impossible here, as all 5 Police albums, each a brilliant work unto itself, is represented in its entirety.  In addition, all singles, alternate versions, some live tracks and B-side only gems round out this great collection.  Truly a great band, who chose to disband at their peak created music that continue to inspire and entertain fans old &amp; new.  This set would fit well into any music collection.
B0000024RQ|3.0|The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan boasts a number of superlative songs, one might even venture to suggest that \\"Girl from North Country\\" and \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\\" sit among the greatest American tunes of the century. Yet it seems for every brilliant track on this album there rests an equally torpid and self-righteous political statement. Irrespective of one's politics these in retrospect seem immature and inane in subject and at times songcraft. \\"Oxford Town\\" and the vastly overrated \\"Masters of War\\" fit this description best in their repetitive whining. Three stars it is.
0399134204|4.0|I liked this book so much, I'm passing it along to my teenage daughter.  It will be interesting to hear her take on it!  <br />The relationships between these mothers and daughters, which are explored from a unique cultural perspective, translate with crystal clarity.  I was able to identify so well with these characters and their frustrations in trying to relate to each other - proving it doesn't take a drastic cultural gap to make your daughter (or your mother) sometimes seem strange and alien!<br />It wasn't a perfect novel; tjump from one character to the next at every chapter was so jolting, I was very tempted to read the book out of order.  Also, the end seemed somehow unfocused - I haven't seen the movie, but the book didn't end with a pat Hollywood-style wrap-up.  <br />Don't rush through this one to find out what happens; the pleasure is in the read itself.
078322608X|5.0|12 Monkeys is the best Terry Gilliam film and one of the best science fiction movies of all time.  It is an intelligent time travel thriller filled with so much density and complexity that it gets better even after being viewed 20 or 30 times.  Bruce Willis gives the performance of his life and so does Brad Pitt.<br />But more than just the great film, this DVD has more to offer.  There is a 2 hour making-of documentary called The Hamster Factor that is the best behind-the-scenes movie I've ever seen.  Gilliam suspected that he might have fights with the studio over this film like he did with Brazil and so he documented every part of production with complete honesty.  This is a wonderful way to see the real unglamourous production of the classic movie.  Great stuff.
B000000JO3|5.0|Ian MacKaye stood at the helm of this now legendary flamethrowing hardcore punk band who uncaged themselves from the doldrums of suburbia to drive beautiful Nagasaki-like havoc through the ears and sensibilities of those lucky enough to have crossed their path. <br /> MacKaye is often mentioned, sometimes as just an adherent, sometimes as the actual founder, of the &quot;straight-edger&quot; movement, which advocates abstience from narcotics and clothing made of fur (but not abstinence from violence, as the residents of Salt Lake City can tell you, where many straight-shooters have been jailed for getting rough with those who don't share their lifestyle). <br /> MacKaye makes no bones about his dislike for alcohol, and sees beer bottles not as things to drink from, but as things to hit people with (&quot;Bottled Violence&quot;). And don't you dare ask MacKaye for reparations (&quot;Guilty of Being White&quot;). <br /> Of course, MacKaye went off to form Fugazi, who continue the message heard here, albeit with some slight alterations, but they will never (and show no signs of) coming anywhere near the combination of guitar, drums, bass and violent self-reflection exuded in young-MacKaye's vocals that Minor Threat possessed in their heyday.
B00001U0E1|4.0|When &quot;Shakespeare In Love&quot; won the Oscar for best picture, beating out Saving Private Ryan, I figured it must be an exceptionally good picture. This was before I saw it. Not to say that this film isn't good, but it certainly doesn't invoke the sense of deep thought and emotion that Saving Private Ryan did.<br />The two pictures are certainly different. This one is an accurate portrayal of late 16th century London, where we find the young Shakespeare with a serious case of writer's block. He desperately needs to come up with a new play for some much needed money, and his inspiration comes when he sees Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) and falls, well, in love.<br />Viola is a great fan of literature and plays, and wants nothing more than to act in one. However, at the time, women were not allowed to act, and so she has to disguise herself as a young man (this added to the comedic aspect of the film, and was even charming). Needless to say, Viola ends up being cast as Juliet in Shakespeare's new play, and it is fun to watch the two act together on stage, because no one else knows who Juliet really is.<br />In terms of a romantic comedy, this movie does very well. It is full of the witty dialogue and genuine, intellectual humor that is found only in the best of movies. The only problem I have with the romance in this movie is the amount of kissing. The camera can't seem to get away from them. The relationship between Viola and Shakespeare seems built more around lovey-dovey kissing than anything else.<br />In all other ways, however, the film succeeds. The play, when it is finally acted out, is a superb climax. The whole movie is lighthearted and fun, and would be suitable for all ages were it not for the sexual overtones.

0792156684|4.0|When I first saw Titanic, I thought it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. Upon a second viewing, however, I noticed things I hadn't before. Like to overdone romance that borders on Hollywood-cheesy.<br />The film itself is a marvel of modern technology. While some of the computer effects look artificial, there are some spectacular scenes, especially the whole sinking sequence, which takes up nearly a quarter of the movie. I will say that this is the best part of the movie (much like in Pearl Harbor, where the attack is the best).<br />The love story that is so central to this movie is well done and never really feels contrived. The meeting between Jack (diCaprio) and Rose (Winslet) is clever and believable, and their feelings grow toward one another naturally and at a good pace. The length of the movie helps you develop feelings for the main characters, and you want their love to continue uninterrupted. However, you cannot help shaking your head at some of the scenes, such as the completely contrived &quot;I'm flying Jack, I'm flying&quot; scene at the bow of the ship. Please.<br />Acting is superb, and it is through their roles in this film that diCaprio and Winslet became famous (diCaprio furthering his Hollywood stardom, and Winslet gaining recognition worldwide). Zane plays the part of the selfishly arrogant fiancee very convincingly, and you find yourself rooting against him throughout the film. The costumes and set decorations are very authentic, and through these the fated ship and its passengers come to life on the screen.<br />There are a lot of people out there that look at this film as a chick flick and refuse to see it because it gushes romantic. I understand why this would be so; this film is intended to be a love story based around a tragic, historical event, and it does a good job. A word of warning, however. The movie tends to border on the melodramatic a good deal of the time, and there is a fair amount of absurdly over-romantic scenes. Jackand Rose can't seem to love each other outside of a soap-opera, yet you find yourself wanting them to succeed despite this.<br />In short, this is an entertaining movie, worth watching if you have an interest in history as it brings the past alive. If you don't like romance, just skip to the last third of the movie, when the boat bites the bullet, and you shouldn't be too disappointed.

1577311523|5.0|I was going through a tough time, trying to deal with depression, with life, when I saw this book recommended by Gillian Anderson on her official web site where she lists some of her favorite things. I was in a local bookstore when I happened on it, picked it up, gave it a quick glance, and was immediately entranced by its message. To truly live in the NOW is quite difficult, and I know I have been riddled with chaotic mind, never being able to quiet the noisy chatter in my head. I was constantly futurizing, looking into the past and using both as a crutch to not live RIGHT NOW. It is so important a message that everyone needs to embrace it before we get swallowed up by the hype and lies that are fed to us by our own minds. This books makes you become aware of the present and how with each day you can become happier with being in the NOW, which is to say by living life to its fullest by just BEING! I cannot express this like Eckhart can, but please read this book and it will unfold its wisdom like a flower...slowly. This is the greatest gift I have given myself in such a long time. I thank my higher power for guiding me to it.
B000053VAF|5.0|Kevin Smith has a movie here that may be as good, if not better, than his classic Clerks as he takes a jab at a touchy and very noteworthy topic, the catholic religion.  And if you put down this movie because you might not think Smith knows what he's talking about, your wrong.  He has everything in check, which is important when making a film about a subject like this, but he is able to bring it with as much sincerity as laughs.<br />A woman (Fiorentino), who has lost the faith, is told that she must go on a holy crusade to stop 2 angels from entering a church in where else, Red Bank NJ, and to stop them from entering a loophole.  But she won't be alone, as she is joined by 2 pot head prophets (Jay and Silent Bob, who have they're biggest role here outside of this years upcoming Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back), an outcast apostle (Chris Rock in one of his best roles) and a cast of others (Salma Hayek, for example).<br />Has scenes that might seem gruesome, but being that they are all in irreverent and good fun, it is worth it.  One of the better satires ever.  George Carlin steals his scenes, by the way.
B00001QEE9|3.0|I really have a mixed reaction to this movie.  There are parts I like, but overall, it just strikes me as an ok movie.<br />The story is about a wooden puppet, Pinocchio, who is brought to life to fulfill the wish of Geppetto.  But to become a real boy, he must learn to be brave and truthful on his own.  Aided by Jiminy Cricket, he heads off into a world filled with temptation.<br />For me, this movie seems slow.  While Geppetto's shop is richly detailed, too much time is spent playing around with the clocks and music boxes.  I do get into the movie in the middle and find it easy to care about the characters.  The scene where Lampwick turns into a donkey still creeps me out.<br />It is interesting to note how the animation had progressed in the 3 years since Snow White.  All the humans were more realistic, even the background people.<br />Those interested in the DVD will be disappointed to learn that the only real bonus feature is the original trailer.  Fortunately, Disney has started including more on their DVD's, giving hope that one day this will be re-released with some interesting behind the scenes information.<br />I realize many people consider this Walt Disney's ultimate masterpiece.  For me, however, this is a good movie but doesn't live up to some of his others.

B00004XONN|5.0|I've been listening to this album nonstop for the last several weeks since I bought it, and it hasn't bored me yet. I am still trying to decide what most of the songs are about, and even if they are supposed to be about anything at all, and it's very exciting to have an album nowadays that doesn't waste my time with the same repetitive beats, and tired old lyrics about infatuation and love. It's not often that a popular music band makes music as lush and lyrically interesting as this. The melodies are beautiful and the tempo on most songs is very slow and relaxed. A lot of the music here has unmistakable resemblances to the work of artists as diverse as Nine Inch Nails and Aphex Twin, but that doesn't detract from the quality. if anything, the music here -- with digitalized timbre and sung with Thom Yorke's strident voice -- is absolutely refreshing. In a word, it's groovy.
6302636779|4.0|In a truly great performance, Audrey Hepburn stars as Gabrielle (and later, Sister Luke), a young Belgian girl and daughter of a famous surgeon, who enters the convent with the ultimate dream of working as a nurse in the Belgian Congo.  From the outset, Hepburn has difficulty working within the vow of obedience, and it becomes a daily struggle to remain faithful to her vow.  The struggle becomes more pronounced in the Congo when working with Peter Finch, a brilliant surgeon who sees her conflict but is not a believer.  Hepburn and Finch have a relationship that is one of the highlights of this film.  The Nun's Story is not an action packed feature, but rather a character study about coming to grips with one's faith, character, and true self.  Hepburn does a terrific job of portraying Sister Luke's conflicts, all the more difficult given the emotional restraint she must show in the role of a nun. The supporting cast of film veterans adds to the excellence of the acting.  I also enjoyed the insight into the training and demands placed on nuns.  The level of sacrifice required surprised me, and although it's not an experience that most of us will ever have ourselves, there's much about human nature that can be appreciated and learned in this film.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Oh my god, this album is so good. From the first heavy electronic notes on &quot;Airbag,&quot; to the last sung phrase, pleading for us to &quot;slow down,&quot; this is the most musically profound popular music album that I've heard in a long while. The musicianship is outstanding, and it never gets dull. Just when you begin to think that a melody has been done to death in repetition, another melody comes in, or the tempo suddenly changes, but everything holds seamlessly together at the same time. This is especially apparent on songs like &quot;Exit Music&quot; and &quot;No Surprises,&quot; and the cheerful &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien.&quot; The lyrics are a bit obtuse for me, but that's part of their charm. They can be interpreted so that the album, contrary to popular belief, can be enjoyed as a collection of diverse songs and not as slave to some overarching theme about technology or the perils of modernism.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Okay.....rap metal or hip hop metal is just stinking the whole scene up. What does it comprise of; 4-5 rappers who proclaim Black Sabbath, Metallica and similar bands to be their influences(but were actually influenced by Public Enemy, or (worse)Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg), a guitarist who cannot play a lead sequence, a good bassist in a wrong band, a drummer who can play a bit...but not too much, a talentless DJ, and of course, a vocalist who wants to sound like Phil Anselmo and woo the ladies at the same time. A true protoype....LIMP BIZKIT. Silly name, silly music...and lyrics are just an excuse to say the F word a zillion times. If 6 million records were sold in USA, it goes to show the number of idiots in the country who can be easily amused by such crap. This band has infact doing the same thing that hair bands like Poison did to heavy metal in the 80's; stinking the scene. Hope this band disappears into oblivion asap
1573225517|4.0|This book is as neurotic as bridget jones is in her diary. The most refreshing thing is that it's about a guy (not a girl) in the nineties trying to figure out why he always ends up in dead end relationships.   I think Nick Hornby is not only an honest and quirky writer but he writes in such eloquence and ease that one goes through this book in a matter of hours.
B000002JSN|5.0|Zeppelin's only double album may seem a bit sprawling and ambitious at first but it's well worth owning.  The album is made up of newer material and outtakes from the previous three albums (III, IV, Houses of the Holy) and you might think that this would result in a lot of filler.  The amazing thing is (and it's a testament to the strength of the band) that the leftovers are first rate and the album somehow manages to feel like a cohesive whole.  It also serves as the best showcase of Zeppelin's diversity, with a large variety of styles explored.  In addition, Physical Graffiti contains some of the group's best songs: &quot;In My Time of Dying&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot;, &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot;, etc.  It's a shame that this album seems to be often overlooked in favour of earlier efforts.  It is at least equal to most of these and I would say it's better than a few of them (I, II).  All in all this is an essential album that cannot be overlooked and definitely one of their best.

6302763835|3.0|From seeing nothing but good reviews for this film, I was expecting big things, and was dissapointed. First of all, WHY WHY WHY is a woman named Steve? What were her parents thinking? Then, there's the plot holes. I cringed when the scientist guy found a huge puddle of spider spooge and immediately decided he should taste it. Also, once he finds out there's a giant spider around, he flies to some professors 200 miles away without telling anyone in the town. I know no one would have believed him, but that brings us to the biggest plot hole of all. Are we really suppossed to believe that absolutely no one has seen this thing walking around? At least the scientist and &quot;Steve&quot; should have noticed; it was right behind their car in the beginning! However, I did find Leo G. Carroll good as the doomed scientist, and Clint Eastwood does some great acting with just his eyes as a bomber pilot wearing a helmet and an oxygen mask.
B00003CXN4|1.0|What do you get when you add a lack of character development, a weak plot, bad acting, and a horrible editing job? Traffic.  I don't even want to write about how bad this movie was, because I don't want to waste more of my life in addition to the two and a half hours a spent watching this film.
B000001E29|5.0|This album competes with Bone Machine for the place of Wait's best work.  It's difficult, chaotic, and not for everyone, but those willing to make the effort to understand its peculiar language will be rewarded.  All of Waits albums contain marvellous songs, but they are often uneven, containing individual numbers that border on banality. Like Bone Machine, this one succeeds as a whole album; it's consistent not only in the quality of the songs, but in their mood and theme.  It may be the pinnacle and perfection of the eclectic, bizarre, and innovative style that Waits began to develop with Swordfishtrombones--a style I call &quot;drunken country munster cabaret&quot;.  But unlike his other albums in that vein, this one isn't marred by the cloying tiresome bruce springsteenish numbers that intrude in otherwise fine albums like Rain Dogs and Mule Variations.  Don't let the critics and fans lie to you about this one.  It's difficult, it's chaotic, but it's brilliant.  It's a beautifully orchestrated trainwreck, and the most innovative thing Waits has ever done.

B00003XB8K|5.0|Enigma just keeps getting better with each release.  As soon as the CD was in my hands I popped it in and got ready to be transported to other worlds.  Like all other Enigma albums this too did not fail to fire up my imagination.  From the opening countdown to the final melody I was traveling.  This group really has a knack for mixing dance rhythms, instruments, opera, and chants into a musical experience unlike no other.  The music simply grips you from the start which very few CDs fail to do these days.  Enigma is for music lovers who like their music to seduce them and expand their minds.  Thank goodness in the age of countless pop ditties which sound so much like a bunch of nothing we have Enigma.  Buy it and experience; buy on line so they can introduce you to more unique worlds along the lines of Enigma.  Highly recommended.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Never has a band I've listened to seem to have such pointless lyrics (&quot;karma police arrest this girl her hitler hairdo is making me feel ill and we have crashed her party&quot;) that make so much perfect sense when sang by Thom Yorke.  Yorke's vocals ARE angstful to the extreme, and therefor I guess some people would get annoyed after a while.  Nevertheless, &quot;OK Computer&quot; is just a stunning album.  Electronic beats and synthesizers are lightly dusted over a piece of dense rock.  The only song I knew coming into this was 'Karma Police', but that's not really even the best song on this.  My favorites are probably the first four songs.  In 'Airbag', Yorke sings as though he really HAS just been saved by an airbag, though I guess that's not really what this song is about... 'Paranoid Android' is really cool because is shifts from quiet, acoustic guitar into a loud, heavy southern rock beat, and then into a wailing section, and then back again.  'Subterranean Homesick Alien' sounds like a futuristic lounge song, but it is just great- it sounds like you just got dropped in the middle of a field after having an actually pleasant alien abduction.  One of my favorites.  I think 'Exit Music (For A Film)' is probably my favorite; a sad song (which makes sense after you figure out what movie it was written for), which begins with an acoustic guitar, and then eventually a space chorus echos in.  There are a few lower songs, though they're not bad by any means.  'Let Down' is kind of just that, but the ending is really interesting.  'No Surprises' is good, but sounds a lot like 'Let Down'.  And that's about it.  &quot;OK Computer&quot; ends on 'The Tourist', a really beautiful, slow, end-of-the day song.<br />&quot;OK Computer&quot; is amazing.  It's humorous, but still serious and dark at the same time.  I love it, and I think you will too.  I'm not just saying that, because if you list rock/alternative music at all, you should at least like this, if not love it.<br />OK?
0807282375|5.0|A while ago, I got a call from my best friend saying that I had to read this series.  Unable to resist a good book, I went out and bought the first one the wek after.  I was incredibly pleased with The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife and couldn't wait for more.  When I first saw The Amber Spyglass, I was surprised about the length (518 pages!).  Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down (just like the first two).  The characters are all incredible- it is one of those books where you feel like you KNOW each and every one of them as if they have jumped out and into your world.  The ending was completely unpredictable (no, I WON'T give it away) and I felt myself shaking with emotion with tears running down my face at the end.  In my opinion, it is the best book in the series.  The only negative about this book is that it is the last of the trilogy and I crave more.  <br />I am sure you will hear from some that this is an overrated book and that it has no value, but those people must not appreciate a good book when they see one- and most have never actually read it, just heard of it.  Personally,every person I have talked to that has actually READ it has loved it- and I think you will too.  Readers will find themselves believing in true love, wondering about death, and hoping that maybe life is not the way we really see it, then questioning all of those beliefs again.  It really gets you thinking.  If this series doesn't make you a Phillip Pullman fan, nothing will.
630528069X|5.0|Brilliantly written, wonderfully acted, and superbly directed action film that is believable in many aspects.  One wonders if the terrorists' actions are over-the-top, but for $640 million...?  I think it's definitely in-line!<br />Alan Rickman plays his villainy wonderfully off of Willis' sardonic bravado.  Our business weasel who tries to &quot;negotitate&quot; his way out is also superb.<br />It's a rollercoaster ride with enough humor thrown in by our idiot Police Chief to keep it entertaining.  I remember seeing it when it first came out and it had me gripping the edge of my seat.  &quot;There are rules for policemen...,&quot; yet our hero does what is necessary to get the job done.<br />Bravo!  Unfortunately, it's followed by a mirror-opposite sequel that makes me want to cry (see my review there).
B000003NA4|3.0|Diana Krall strikes me as odd.  She has incredible talent, but doesn't seem to inject much passion into her music at all.  This didn't seem to bother me, in the abstract, in some of her other things, but it made Love Scenes almost hard to listen to for me.<br />&quot;Quality&quot; performance, but boring to listen to.  And when combined with the lyrics, it's kind of jarring.

It is very well written.  i own all of Kevin Smith's movies.  this one is the best by far.  I watched it for a month straight.  I can tell you ever little quirk.  That is how good it is.  If you dont laugh than you need to get your funny bone checked.  Oh yeah if you wana see Jay and Silent Bob as prophets.  Than this is the movie for you.

This cd deserves only the mention of the musics, Dr. John's &quot;high concept&quot; reaches musical fruition with a swirling array of avant-guard funk, down &amp; Dirty swampy grooves,and Afro-Caraiba poli-ritmos ,performed on mostly organic/acustic instrumentation( outside of the obligatory electric guitar, &amp; electric piano/organ)..... the 2 long &quot;narcotic&quot; tracks, Gris-gris&quot; &amp; &quot;I walk...Splinters&quot; lure you into a trance-like world, where the 2 &quot;danses&quot; evoke a Hoodoo whirling dervish.....&quot;WORLD musics &quot; before the frase was coined! And the strictly New Orleans &quot;Mama Roux&quot; is a second line strut! No &quot;blues -influenced&quot; stuff here, Africa comes home on the drum, and not the &quot;blue-note&quot;. Rough, ragged &amp; poorly produced, the emotion of the musics shines through like the healing rays of a new day's sun! Dr. John's finest hour- he WAS inna right place at the right time, and gris-gris is the legacy!
B000051VWW|5.0|Just like the other albums , this one is excellent. Sade's soulful vocals and the instruments are just perfect. I really love her voice it is so expressive. Hope they continue giving us great music &amp; lyrics ...! Anyone know what happened to sweetback?
B00004S96B|5.0|Every track appears to have been remastered with the greatest of care. My digital reference. Every CD should been accomplished like this. If you are a 'ryche fan, this is an uncomprising must-have.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Limp Bizkit should save all the money they have right now, invest it, and live off of it (they surely have more than enough), because the well has definitely run dry (not that it had much water in the first place!).<br />It's amazing how much they have taken advantage of gullible, pimply, oh-look-at-me-I'm-so-mad-at-the-world teenagers by selling fake anger, or... what's the buzzword?  Ah yes, angst.<br />Kudos to lb for recognizing the money-making potential of the whole situation.
B00003CXN4|1.0|Do not be misled into believing this movie is action-packed, drug running, police bustin', shoot-em up kind of movie.  This movie was the greatest let down I've seen this year.  I pre-ordered this movie months ago and anticipated seeing it.  Definitely do not waste your money on buying it.  Rent it first if you just have to see it and save some money.
B000059ZLH|5.0|This is a must-get for any DT or prgressive rock fan.  I have been a RUSH fan since about 1979, but Dream Theater has taken over.  They are the most talented band there is right now, and Mike Portnoy has brilliantly produced this masterpiece to put the finishing touch on their mind-blowing concept album from last year.
B00003CXN4|5.0|I thought that this movie was good.  I sat mesmerized by the acting, especially that of Benicio Del Torro.  The realism may not be for everyone, but if you can take it, you should most definitely watch this fine motion picture.  My husband Rene didn't like it. He hates anything with violence.  There was one thing lacking in it though, and that is a theme song sung by the lovely and talented, Celine Dion, the greatest singer ever.  I should know, as I am Celine Dion.  Watch the movie, and then listen to my songs.
B000056V73|3.0|I like Cameron Crowe's sensibility, and in a climate where all movies are &quot;edgy&quot; or &quot;lightning-paced&quot; a movie like Almost Famous is a welcome breather.<br />Cameron Crowe's loose fictionalization of his stint as a journalist for Creem and Rolling Stone can take you back to a time in your life where music really mattered and hit you on a personal level; all the references and the soundtrack can really spark your memory. And watching Patrick Fugit portray an intelligent, kind, passionate, and yet, uncool, music fan strikes a real chord in the heart of every aging teen misfit.<br />The real blind spot of this movie lies with the lack of emotional substance: as a journalist, William has been warned to remain impartial to the celebrity of musicians, which he does, but he also seems distant from the music itself; Kate Hudson as Penny Lane idolizes the band, but mostly you see her involved in a damaged, temporary fling with no emotional component; Frances McDormand is the greatest success here, yet her maternal embraces kind of fall into a litany of &quot;don't do drugs, and remember you can't swim&quot; - you get the idea.<br />Even with that, Cameron Crowe's films can't be held to that strict a standard. He makes solid films with some reliable emotional spots, with no pretensions to grand style - like a journalist. While Almost Famous may have some glossed over spots, I can think of many other worse ways to spend an evening.
B000001DQI|5.0|There is no doubt that Elton John is one of the world's best singer/songwriters.  This album (along with Madman Across the Water) proves this.  From the start the album takes off strongly with Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding.  It proceeds into the classic Candle in the Wind which has always been an Elton favorite.  From there the album goes into incredible songs like Bennie and the Jets, Grey Seal, the title track, All the Girls Love Alice, and the rockin Saturday Night's Alright.  I recomend that if you only get one Elton Cd, get this one or Madman Across the Water, it's just Damn good music, easy as that
B000059PR5|5.0|I have watched this movie every time it comes on television. This is not just another n-bomb movie--this can be what a real explosion, or several explosions, is like. I worked at Civil Defense when this was aired. You would not believe the number of paniced citizens that called the next day! You can look at this movie from several directions--as a passive viewer just watching a movie about a bomb; as a viewer who loves disaster type films; or in my case, as a person who not only loves disaster type films, but also who knows that real film footage was used in this movie from the U.S. Army who were conducting tests in the 40's and 50's on then atomic bombs to see what would happen in the case of upper level explosions, ground explosions, and sub-ground explosions. If you like this movie, then watch the British version called &quot;Threads&quot;. Hopefully, some day, they'll also put &quot;Threads&quot; on video or DVD. They're both very well written and researched.
0345409671|5.0|I think Anne Rice can read my mind. I've often pondered wheather the devil was really bad.  And anne rice has brought a lot of thing into prespective for me.  yeah it's all fiction but definitely a brain teaser.  I recommend it to any one with an open mind
B00005B58Y|5.0|Aside from the Miles/Coltrane box released last year, this marks the first time that this material has appeared in true stereo in over four decades. Prior to that, it was only available in mono or electronically re-channeled stereo. The title cut also marked the first time that Miles had written in the modal style that would be immortalized on the Kind of Blue album. Expanding the group to a sextet was one of the giants of alto sax, Julian 'Cannonball' Adderley. Adderley's style of playing complemented Coltrane's perfectly--at times requiring you to really listen closely to tell who's playing what. Both players had incredible range on their instruments. Milestones includes three bonus tracks--alternate versions of &quot;Two Bass Hit,&quot; &quot;Milestones&quot; which is actually superior to the 'original'), and Monk's &quot;Straight, No Chaser.&quot; Milestones is a true classic album from a classic group.
B00003CXPC|5.0|I rented Billy Elliot last weekend, and I loved it! The story was great, and the acting was really good. Jamie Bell is a brillant actor, and hopefully, in the near future, he'll do some movies in the US. I hope to see more of him soon!
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is amazing.  Maynard's voice is probably one of the greatest sounds known to man.  the best song on the cd is Schism, although the song Lateralisis pretty good, too.  Songs 2 and 4 are kinda boring, but the rest of the cd makes up for them.
B000001ESP|5.0|I find it delightfully ironic that Rush, a band critics loved to hate, released Moving Pictures, the album I'm sure critics hate to love -- it had them eating their words, after all. An undeniably great album from those pretentious and nerdy progressive rockers? Yeah right! Seriously, it is difficult to contest this disc's perfection, which is the logical extension of its predecessor, Permanent Waves (it could very well be called Permanent Waves Part II). Moving Pictures is a highly engaging, accessible, and timeless piece of work.<br />Although the touted folds of progressive rock were being peeled off, the improvements over their previous releases are manifold. Very importantly, Lifeson's solos are more melodic than ever, but the style is still unmistakably his. The songwriting is intense and the musicianship is brilliant, but this is catchy stuff. This is probably the most welcoming progressive rock album ever recorded. I mean, you didn't have to like progressive rock to like Moving Pictures. That's part of this record's magic...but only part, mind you. We all know Rush is terrific in terms of ability, but we would have never guessed they could write such great songs? Yes, we had hints of it with &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill,&quot; but here the songs are better than you'd be led to expect. (Although I must say I prefer Permanent Waves to this, on the whole...heresy, I know!!)<br />Moving Pictures is ultra-sleek, commercially accessible but not-necessarily-commercially-directed songwriting is done impossibly well. The album's production is perfect, hitting the right balance between Rush's power and clarity, which is just right for this kind of release. (Before this, rawness and power were good...after, clarity and slickness were preferable.)  Rush's lyrics were changing to accommodate the shift in musical direction. Less broadly philosophical, more modern and &quot;normal,&quot; but still intelligent and socially intuitive. &quot;Red Barchetta&quot; is the last sci-fi song Peart ever penned (unless the you count the robot songs). The concept seems simple, but there's an interesting bit of underlying commentary that we expect from Peart. &quot;Witch Hunt's&quot; lyrical message is fairly acidic because of the scathing metaphor involved. Clever stuff. What I always liked about Peart is that it was easy to understand what his songs were about, but his diction and intelligence were always inspired.<br />Some call it the best Rush album. Some call it the best rock album. I'll avoid the extremes and just say it's a must-have classic that belongs in the musical library of any rock n' roll or progressive rock fan. Oh yeah, and if you like Rush but you don't have this, something's seriously wrong with you.ta&quot; is the last sci-fi song Peart ever penned (unless the you count the robot songs).

B00001NFCY|2.0|This album is a disapointment to me.\\"Higher\\"is a fine song, with it's good singing and catchy/burly guitar riffs.\\"With arms wide open\\"is sweet(The strings version is even better).Those songs are worth the purchase of this Cd.How ever things go down hill after that.Some of the other songs are okay& some are just terrible.Think monotonous,bland,simplistic,sluggish& predictable.The lead singer has a good voice, but is monotonous.  There's no blazing Pearl Jam-like guitars,crafty guitar work/rythyms of Alice In Chains, sharp/powerful tempo changes like Live and it just doesn't rock out like a Stone Temple Pilots Cd.  I know the comparison will upset some people, but I would much-rather reach for and crank up something like that.  As popular as this Cd is I expected it to be real good, despite a couple bright spots it just isn't.
B0000028M7|5.0|Alice in Chains is sorely missed. They certainly left their mark on the nineties - I really can't think of a better heavy metal band. This album, Dirt, is their major artistic statement. And Layne Staley, their lead singer, certainly has more than his share of demons to exorcise. Except Alice in Chains never lapses into pompous, self-absorbed angst like Nine Inch Nails or the Smashing Pumpkins. Staley's voice perfectly conveys the despair he sings about, and its grittiness and roughness only serves to enhance the feeling.<br />It is said that this album is mainly about Staley's heroin abuse. Assuredly some songs are - &quot;God smack&quot; and &quot;Junkhead&quot; are obvious ones. Others may have nothing to do with drugs at all, but still maintain the mood of despair of a hopeless, almost lifeless addict. Despite all that, Staley's voice and his tone of resignation often has almost a comforting effect - this is one of the best albums to help one through depression. To be sure, this album has quite a few really rockin' rockers - &quot;God smack&quot;, &quot;Dam that River&quot;, etc., but it also has subtlety. An enduring quality pervades many songs, even where it has no place - &quot;Rooster&quot; is about an American soldier, about to be killed by a Vietnamese sniper, completely outgunned, and yet when the song's done the listener gets a hopeful feeling, as if he'd just heard a survival story. The album ends with the menacing, soul-wrenching &quot;Would?&quot;, which still carries the same, almost foolhardy feeling of hope. The best moments are &quot;Rain When I Die&quot;, &quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, and the aforementioned &quot;Rooster&quot; and &quot;Would?&quot;.<br />One final note - it seems that a bunch of people like to put down AiC and call them a &quot;Godsmack ripoff&quot;. Allow me to clue you in - Alice in Chains were in the early nineties, and Dirt was made in 1992. They were also good. Godsmack released their first album in 1997, and nothing they ever made even comes close to Staley's feeling and passion. Godsmack got their name from the Alice in Chains song, not the other way around. Thank you.
B00003CXAT|4.0|Ok, Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite movies to date.  The acting is superb and is filled with great action and some hilarious dialogue.  The only flaw with the dvd is the disappointments: 1. The Jurassic Park 3 Preview is nothing.  No actual shots of the movie.  It is basically just telling you that there is actually a JP3 which several people already know.  2. No deleted scenes.  This is one of my favorite features in all dvds and I would have loved to see some deleted scenes because I know there were some.  For example, when the movie was released in theaters, there was a scene where Ellie (Laura Dern) picked a leaf from a bush while driving in the beach.  That scene had a great shot to it, but they left it out when they switched the movie over to video.  Why?   Other than those 2 reasons, the dvd is a great buy, and I totally recommend it.
B000006NXP|5.0|So lyrical, so flowing. I see that all of the previous reviewers have given this an unequivocal thumbs up. It's certainly worth it. Rarely has such a heavy composer been treated with such a lightness of touch. The strings sound positively jaunty.<br />My one one fault with the release is the lack of a fill-up, but then perhaps anything else could not reach the same standard.<br />It's a pity that Kleiber records so infrequently, but that may be why he conducts so well when he does.

B000000OSG|5.0|This CD just rocks from beginning to end.  The first few songs, however, are some of the best ever recorded in rock.  From Civil War to Yesterday, they all rock.  This CD along with the first Use Your Illusion CD represent GNR at their best.  Their sound was still growing as a band, and who knows how good they could've been if they hadn't broken up.  Oh well, pick this CD up and crank it up!!
B000053GSJ|5.0|Wow...what an awesome movie! Great footage of F-14's (a navy plane). If you like current military stuff and San Diego (and areas around it...) this movie is perfect for you!
B00005J73X|4.0|I was a little dissapointed with this CD.  The overall sound quality of the live performances was not as good as it should've been, especially on the new songs.  I liked the stuff from 1985, but wish there could've been more of it.  I really liked the version of Runaway from 1985, and the Neil Young cover was cool.  But, for a really great live album, check out the other Jersey guy's  Live in New York City CD.
B00004YYDI|4.0|When I saw Leon in HK back in 1994, it was the long version the same as this DVD. I bought the standard edition DVD a couple years ago and felt that it is OK in the shorter version. The only significant addition to this DVD is scenes that show Leon bring along Mathilda in doing his job (killing bad people) and a few more scenes that show Mathilda seducing Leon. Probably those scenes were cut to avoid controversy or something but either versions work well if you are looking for good action movies. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the standard version (the WS) has better sounding Dolby Digital 5.1. If you are action fans I think you are better off with the standard edition as it gives you both WS &amp; Full screen. But if you are a big fans of Leon, get the uncut version. Great movie.
0060392886|1.0|is official the boys have done it all just when you think is all over they out do themselves this book is great even for someone like me that does not like to read but when I heard about this I had to have one and once I started reading I was hook I could not stop This is a must have for every cruehead out there  now if tommy will get back....that will be something but then again they will save it for the dirt 2  buy the book it rocks
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Absolutely!!!  This is definetly an album worth buying.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor are very talented singers and other songs as Rhythm of the Night and Lady Marmalade make this soundtrack a SMASH HIT!!!  Whoever likes musicals will fall in love with this soudtrack.  This is definetly the one to own.  If It's one soundtrack to buy this summer make it Moulin Rouge.  It will take you on a joy ride.
B000006OS2|1.0|I can't believe Good Times Video actually released this DVD without doing any touch up whatsoever, nor even trying to get a better copy before making the DVD.  Normally one of the funner John Wayne movies, a sort of western version of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew,&quot; it's nearly impossible to enjoy watching any of it due to the poor quality of the DVD.  From the opening credits to the closing credits, the image is full of scratches and holes.  There are even several complete scenes which are out of focus and blurry. This was obviously an attempt by Good Times to make a quick buck off of John Wayne's name.  Let's hope that at some point in the future someone gets the rights to this film, restores it, and cleans up the images so that the charm of this movie isn't lost to future generations.  Save your money on this one and pickup &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; or &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot;. At least those DVD's are not hard on the eyes.
0684800713|4.0|This is not an enrapturing book.<br />This is not a suspenseful book.<br />It is not a gripping page-turner, nor a mystery.<br />This is just a wonderful book by Hemingway. He tells a story of mid 1920's spain, and of almost-youths travelling and enjoying life. Its a book that makes you want to curl up with it and just lay about on the couch reading.<br />I love Hemingway's writing, and have been a fan ever since reading The Old Man And The Sea. This book is more of his razor sharp, concise, and insightful prose. Definitely recommended.<br />By the by, anyone who has been a participant of burning man ... can identify with the story, and the emotions and set of the characters.
0805062971|5.0|I watched the movie and loved it.  Then a friend gave me a copy to borrow.  I didn't really want to read it but I began to skim through it.  I was absolutely hooked.  Some call this book dark but I see it only as reflective of our own world.  Palahniuk hits the mark in so many ways that I've ordered all of his books.<br />Of course, this is not for the faint of heart or those who have a rosy outlook on life.  This is for all of us that find our culture lacking in some way.  Keep writing Palahniuk.  I'll keep reading.
B000009ED0|5.0|Don't immediately write off Kid Rock as being anotherrun-of-the-mill rap rocker. Devil Without A Cause is a serious ... .. CD!! This CD has substance which cannot be said about most rock/rap recordings. Kid Rock is very talented and this CD can attest to this statement. &quot;Cowboy&quot; is without a doubt one of the most unique tunes ever written and produced!! Bawitdaba has to be one of the most rocking tunes EVER done!! These are not the only great tunes on Devil Without A Cause- the rest of the CD is equal if not superior to these. Give this CD a chance- you will be very satisfied!! There are not enough good things that I can say about Devil Without A Cause- just buy the CD and see what I mean.
6303402348|5.0|I have seen a lot of movies, and among those a lot of great ones (&quot;Almost Famous&quot;, &quot;Face/Off&quot;, &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;) but I am very confident in saying that this is the greatest movie I have ever seen.  There are just not words to describe its brilliance.  I first saw it at the theater, when it came out.  I was about 11, and it was almost too intense for me.  This movie is very much like a window into real life.  You get a look at pain, torment, racism, war violence, and the very essence of the human spirit.  And, it's all presented in a fairly simple manner, so as not to go over anyone's head.  The characters are all presented in fine form, and the acting is off the charts.  Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors of all time, up there with Robin Williams and Nicolas Cage.  Gary Sinise is up there, too.  I have seen this movie countless times, and it never gets old.  Each viewing is like a thrilling journey, and even though you know where it's going, you can't wait to get there.  You've got comedy, action, drama, this movie transcends genres.  I could probably sit here and praise this movie all day, but that would still not do it justice.  You have to experience it for yourself.  I can't imagine that any other movie will ever come within miles of this.  It is truly a masterpiece of film.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I feel like going for a run...
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I've listened to in years.  Stevie's return to the music arena was well overdue and long awaited.  The music on this CD is classic Stevie Nicks.  It has the ability to take you to a good place as you listen.  The guest appearances from Sheryl Crow, Natalie Manes, Sarah McLachlan and Lindsay Buckingham (I only wish he had some vocal input) were excellent.  My favorite tracks on this CD are 'Too Far From Texas' and 'That Made Me Stronger.'  Excellent job, Stevie!
6304618344|5.0|When you think of an action movie, what is the first thing that pops into your mind?  Blood, bullets, bad acting, and above all, lots of 'splosions.  Well, most of those things are here, but there is one thing that sets it apart from the Steven Seagal bloodbaths of yore: the acting.  I have never before seen an action movie with acting this superb.  Everyone in here does a great job, but I think Nicolas Cage is the one that really shines.  This guy can act!  He goes effortlessly from psycho criminal to &quot;the nice guy&quot;, doing very believable dramatic scenes.  While the main drawback of this movie is that it's pretty farfetched (drive-thru surgery, immediate recovery of the surgery, the magnet-shoes thing), it's still very well-written and very enthralling.  And hey, you gotta feel sorry for the parents that had not one, but two criminal mastermind sons.  I guess if you name your kids Castor and Pollacks, you're asking for trouble!<br />Anyway, if you're looking for a good action movie, forget about the Seagal and Van Damme movies where the fight scenes are the only things that make them worth it, get something that is well-written and never misses a step.  This is not only the best action movie I've seen, it's one of the top ten best movies I've ever seen.  &quot;Con Air&quot; is a good choice as well.
0767849493|4.0|I had seen both Chasing Amy and Clerks and had mixed opinions on those, but I admit I laughed out loud several times during this movie.  Will there be those that dislike it for its depiction of religion and mixture of profanity and sexual innuendo.  Sure, but many of those who would be offended by this get all up in arms about all sorts of trivial stuff.  I like to think the &quot;disclaimer&quot; at the beginning of the movie that God hopefully has a sense of humor holds true.  This movie while a comedy, does make you sit and think about religion itself and the way its structured.  In all I found the movie both funny and somewhat enlightening.  I do agree with others that I found the overall ending somewhat weak, but come on its a comedy how are you supposed to depict the almighty.  I'll admit that sometime I grimaced at the comments from Jay that toe the line, but I still found the movie funny.  So overall, if you are someone who likes to laugh and doesn't get all worked up about religion, rent this, maybe even buy it and you'll find yourself smiling.
B000000W5L|5.0|This is by far the deepest Stones album there is.  It is some of the grittiest blues you will ever hear.  The album can take a while to get into, but once you do you will be glad.  Exile caps off the Stones best years (1968 - 1972) beautifully and sums up every undercurrent that is great about the band.  It is the Stones album where their love and respect for black blues/soul/r&amp;b comes into its own and stands alone.  Buy this album and listen until you 'get' it, and you will be set free.
6302517036|5.0|The best vampire movie.  William Ragsdale plays the teenager who sees strange things go on at his newly arrived neighbor's house.  He eventually enlists the help of Roddy McDowall who plays the fearless vampire killer.  A memorable performance by Stephen Geofreys as William Ragsdale's strange friend.  Also Amanda Bearse plays Willaim Ragsdale's love interest, Chris Sarandon plays the newly arrived neighbor/vampire, and Jonathan Stark as Chris Sarandon's watcher/aide.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Dire Straits hit the ground running with their self-titled debut album. The brilliant &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; suggested genius in both leader Mark Knopfler's songwriting ability as well as his unique, lyrical guitar style. &quot;Communiqué&quot; - the hurriedly slapped together follow-up - was clearly an attempt to cash in quickly on what worked so well the first time out; the only elements that succeed are the ones that blatantly imitate the superior first disc.<br />With &quot;Making Movies&quot;, however, a profound sense of maturation made its presence felt. This is surely Dire Straits' finest hour, a collection of cinematic songs that created a renewed vision and provided further depth to the band's ability to tell great stories and rock out while doing so. All of the songs are first-rate: the yearning &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; stands among the finest compositions of Knopfler's career; &quot;Solid Rock&quot; and &quot;Expresso Love&quot; are as explosive as anything Dire Straits has produced before or since.<br />Best of all, to my ears, is the stunning opener &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;. It seems that the departure of rhythm guitarist David Knopfler freed brother Mark's creative juices considerably, allowing him to pen a song that manages to top &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;. This masterful epic runs the gamut of emotions - thrilling, sad, triumphant and bittersweet - employing the imagery of a carnival amusement as a metaphor for first love: when you're riding high it's ecstasy, but the ride eventually comes to an end. The heartbreaking solo that closes out the tune has to be one of the greatest moments in the recorded history of electric guitar. <br />Well-deserved credit also goes to producer Jimmy Iovine, who brings to the album the same bigger than life sound that worked so well five years prior on Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Born to Run&quot;. Not coincidentally, E Street Band member Roy Bittan fills out the sound by lending his signature piano flourishes and arpeggios to the proceedings, most impressively at the conclusion of the aforementioned &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;.<br />This remastered disc boasts an amazing sound (Pick Wither's drums sound like they're in the room next to you), and is a bargain at the price.

630522577X|5.0|This movie is outstanding in every way.  The acting, the music, the costumes, the sets, I could go on and on.  The movie is far more than just decent and anyone who can't see that would have to be somewhat of a fool!  Even though Julie Andrews had already played Eliza on Broadway (and may have seemed more suited for the role in the movie )  Audrey Hepburn does a very good job and adds incomparable charm to the role in one of her best performances.  I have also heard that Audrey could sing quite well but that her voice was not what they wanted for the film and she was dubbed.  The music is wonderful too and I love the romantic story.  If you have not seen it yet you definitely should!
0671027344|5.0|I loved this book; I read it in one sitting.   I read some of the reviews about how people thought that Charlie was unrealistic and how teenagers don't talk or act like like that.  Well, I am a teenager.  I could identify with Charlie-it's as if this book was written about me (or at least someone very closely resembling me).  Also, I talk like they do in the book.  Granted, I suppose that there will be those who won't relate to this book.  However, if you are quiet, intelligent, painfully shy, and kind of a loner like me then you should love this book.
B00005B5L4|2.0|The good news:  Good sound quality.  Excellent additional material, including backing instrumental tracks with voiceovers by band members talking about the songs' creations.  Also includes many still photos of the band members and studio logs/tape box logs.<br />The bad news:  At least on my player, the 2-channel only track is wrought with dropouts.  Perhaps I just have a defective disc, and I plan to exchange it to see.  I have no problems with any other dvd audio or video disc in my player.<br />The REALLY bad news:  The 5.1 mix is pretty dreadful.  The surrounds are used WAY too much for my taste.  There are instruments missing in the mix and there are instruments added to the mix that shouldn't be there.  (Drums added to \\"Never Going Back Again\\"?!)  If you don't care about the surround mix being even similar to the album, then this may not bother you.  Certainly I expect a surround mix to differ somewhat (otherwise why mix to 5.1 channels?), but not THIS much, especially not on an album so well known and loved.  It isn't like this is a new recording where one could get used to both a 2-channel and 5.1-channel mix simultaneously.  (One example of a surround mix that does use the surround speakers to great effect but doesn't change the overall sound of the music is the Corrs' \\"In Blue\\".  kd lang's \\"Invincible Summer\\" also does not vary much from the stereo mix, but the mix doesn't use the surround channels much anyway.)<br />MORE REALLY BAD NEWS:  While I appreciate the addition of \\"Silver Springs\\", why did they place it in the MIDDLE of the album and move \\"Songbird\\" to the END?  A \\"bonus track\\" is normally tacked on at the end of an album so as not to alter the original presentation.  If this was a deliberate decision by the band, it is not mentioned anywhere, either in their commentaries or in the booklet's credits.  Instead, in the commentary to \\"Songbird\\" they talk about how great it was that that track followed \\"Go Your Own Way\\" on the album because that pairing created such a great contrast!  How ironic that they moved it, then, for this release! I wonder if this will be one of those cases where there will be a \\"deluxe\\" reissue in a year or two, with the band members stating, \\"Hey, we didn't sanction what they did to our album.  Buy this new disc, it has our stamp of approval.\\"  From what I can tell, this is the first review of the dvd audio disc.  If someone quickly scanned the information here, however, one might assume, given the nearly 5-star rating, that this DVD AUDIO disc deserved those high marks.  Yes, this is a GREAT pop/rock album, musically speaking -- but this version of it has too many flaws to recommend it.
B00005K9LK|5.0|This remixed release of Screaming for Vengeance sounds even better now than the album did in the early 80's. All tracks are clean with great bass hits. This album has been lovingly restored and belongs in not only any Priest fan's library, but any metal fan's. If you do not have this album, pick it up now! Although I do have to say, skip the extra track (there's a reason they didn't put it on the album) and go directly to the live cut of Devil's Child! Don't Wait!
B00000064G|5.0|Nick Drake has been an underground hero for musicians for many years now but only recently got any real public attention because of a VW commerical. There's nothing wrong with VW using his song, it's just a shame that commercial success never happened for Nick when he was alive. He deserved the attention he has received in 1999 way back in 1970.<br />Nick was an incredible acoustic guitarist with a diverse fingerstyle technique with great finger-rolls and clever melodies woven throughout complex harmonies and various tunings.<br />Pink Moon is raw and dark but absolutely pretty at the same time --and precisely played with just one acoustic guitar and an occasional piano. His baritone voice is delivered in an often  slurred and breathy haze with lyrics that convey a sense of despair and emotional nakedness. The chords in his songs will weave a Minor progression of almost hopeless despair then break into a Major bridge and rising vocal melodies that brings a hope of soaring transcendence into the light - only to have it dashed back down to the ground. Beautiful.<br />My favorite track is &quot;Parasite.&quot; His guitar line brings a sense of calm and reassurance -even thorugh lyrics filled with personal inadequacy and despair. &quot;Pink Moon&quot; is the lead-off track that was used by VW and gave Nick life after death. If this album came out today, it would sound completely fresh and new, unlike many other folk albums from the same time. Timeless.
0345442989|4.0|James Lucerno is greatly welcome in the Star Wars universe. I enjoyed his last two novels immensely and now he has taken a wonderful new step into the prequel time line. Reading this book, it really seems he has a handle on Senator Palpatine. If you were left wanting more of him (like I was) from the Phantom Menace, look no further. This book sets up the events of Episode 1 with Palpatine angling for the taxation of the outer rim trade routes on one hand and dealing with the Trade Federation on the other. Valorium is shown to be even more of Palpatine's target in this book. And Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan are well used, but the real strength in this story is the Senator who would be Emperor Palpatine. Star Wars fans...buy this one!
B00004SCX6|3.0|Okay, I definetly can't give Britney a 1 because the albums not THAT horrible, i mean if it can sell around (12 million, was it?) CDs, then it can't be that bad, but really, some of the songs on the album are actually pretty good, like Lucky. But then again, I can't give her a 5 because like someone before me put, a lot of the songs *do* sound the same, so ill just give her a 3, smack in the middle, its not too horrible, but its not he best album out there either! :)
B00005K9LM|5.0|Can early Priest sound any better? Once again a great album made to sound better due to a loving remaster. The sound quality is excellent and performs great on today's speakers. Love Bites really hit's on it's bass tracks with a good subwoofer set up. The only bad piece of the new album is the new unreleased track, but the live Heavy Duty/Defenders of the faith cut makes up for it. (Hint, if you are going to pick up all 12 of the rereleases and have a cd burner..there are 17 new live releases in this set. Burn yourself a new Priest concert experience!) Once again... dont wait!
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead is a perfect example of band who has consistently changed their musical writing style over the years, bla bla bla, but this is indeed true.  The four Radiohead albums are so different from each other in my opinion, that some people may or may not even be able to tell it was the same band, save for Thom Yorke's otherwise distinctive voice.  When I first heard &quot;Optimistic,&quot; the first single, I wasn't all too impressed because it just wasn't the Radiohead that I was used to, not at all like &quot;Karma Police&quot; (I'm sure others felt the same).  But, Kid A is just one more album in the progression of Radiohead's inventive capabilities.  The seemingly mellow, otherwise obscure melodies make this album sound sort of like a bunch of bleeping computer sounds at times, except for the loud horn section of &quot;The National Anthem.&quot;  However, despite the obscurity that Radiohead puts out in Kid A, its really interesting how the melodies seem to be weeded in it all, especially with &quot;How to Disappear Completely.&quot;  Overall, Kid A took awhile to grow on me.  You are not going to fall in love with this album just after hearing one song.  You'll have to hear the whole album, song by song, in the correct order, to be able to appreciate this one.  I think that that's what Radiohead intended. You might notice how there isn't really one big smash radio hit?  Not like the mega popular singles that have come out of &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;Pablo Honey.&quot;  Radiohead demonstrates with Kid A, that they are trying to go out on a limb and create a new style.  Techno beats and horn sections will prove this to be true.  If you're not a Radiohead fan, but would like to be, don't start out with this album.  It takes a die-hard Radiohead fan to fall in love with this one right away.  Personally, Kid A is my second most favorite Radiohead album next to OK Computer, it just took a little while and a couple of listens for it to sink in on me.
0060278234|4.0|I've read many of Garth Nix's books including Sabriel and Lirael...Shade's Children, The Seventh Tower series (now waiting for book 5, due out in June 2001). The wonderful thing about all of them is his ability to take you to different worlds and make you believe that they truly exist. In Lirael, the fantasy world of the Old Kigdom continues. Lirael, a daughter of the Clayr, struggles while growing up with a strong sense of not belonging to her world; not fitting in. We enjoy watching her come of age. Mr. Nix includes many wonderful plot twists and new characters including Sameth, the son of Sabriel and Touchstone, who is the apparent Abhorsen in waiting. While Sabriel, the first book in this series, stands alone with no need for a sequel other than the desire of the reader to continue experiencing this wonderful world; Lirael definitely leaves you waiting to see what will happen next. It is truly only part of the story. In all honesty, I would have prefered a larger book with the full story, but understand the necessity to make two normal length books instead. Patience is a virtue, afterall. The sequel should be out as early as spring 2002. One last thing...As others have mentioned in earlier reviews, this book as well as the others mentioned are good reading for adults as well as young adults. As with the Harry Potter books, it's an opportunity to get people young and old to read books with joy and anticipation. If you enjoyed Sabriel, you will be thankful that Lirael is here and the Abhorsen soon to follow.

B00003CXDZ|5.0|This is a close to a perfect creative venture as anything gets. Here is a film that has it all. It is joyful, funny, passionate, romantic, sad, and optimistic. The art direction, sets, musical treatments, casting, dancing, costumes are all executed with great talent, judgment and gusto. I have seen this twice with a large New York audience and this crowd, known for being jaded and cynical adored this film. They not only laughed throughout (and cried) but both times the crowd broke into spontaneous applause at least five times. A heard a few gasps as well. It seemed as if we were participating in a live performance. That's how involving it was. My husband and I can't wait to see it yet again. Kidman and McGregor are magical. It is one of the most remarkable films ever made. A true original in every respect. Do see it.
0671582364|5.0|Every course I ever took about writing discouraged me from writing fiction.  The process described seemed unnatural, uninteresting, and unbelievably complex.  So I became a nonfiction writer.  Mr. Stephen King's memoir and observations about his methods has totally turned that around.  He proposes a method that works much like the way I write nonfiction.  Following his advice, I feel like I can create and enjoy creating novels now.  That is a wonderful gift, and I appreciate the insights very much.  I also wondered how a novelist goes from aspiring to full-time writer.  The detailed descriptions here gave me many &quot;ah-ha&quot; experiences.  Mr. King's horrible accident made me curious about how his recovery was going.  I was fascinated by the long postscript that describes how the &quot;writing&quot; part of the memoir was written during his painful rehabilitation and mending.<br />This book should be read by everyone who loves fiction writing, whether as a reader or a writer.  If salty language bothers you, that will be a drawback.  I deliberately listened to the unabridged audiocassette so that I could hear the nuances of meaning from his voice and timing.  I'm glad I did.<br />Mr. King's great strength is that he tells it like it is, and does so as simply as possible.<br />His description of letting a novel tell itself through the characters, starting from a fascinating situation, struck me as an enormous insight.  In nonfiction, the equivalent is to start with a painful problem that almost everyone has.  Then tell stories that take the reader inside the solution.  Be honest and genuine in how you do it.  I suddenly realized that nonfiction writers have an advantage because we can test our stories with those who lived them.  The fiction writers have to use their own mental ear and those of readers to do the same thing.<br />After you finish reading this book, you definitely should try out his suggestion to write a thousand words a day.  I know it sounds like a lot, but your speed and facility will rapidly increase.  And it really does feel like being more alive!<br />Tell the truth!like a lot, but your speed and facility will rapidly increase.  And it really does feel like being more alive!<br />Tell the truth!<br />
0140131558|5.0|This is unquestionably the most surreal and intricately written novel I have ever read. First off, the prose is constructed, not written.  It reads as if each word was carefully fit into each sentence, making sure that it was the perfect word to use for that particular place in the novel. Then there is the symbolism and numerous hidden themes, which have a dizzying type of effect as you uncover them. This is the type of book that you want to re-read as soon as you finish out of fear that you may have missed something important.  The way the three stories unfold around each other is proof of uncommon literary genius. These three novellas are chuck full of unnerving suspense with the best part being that not all the questioned are answered in the end.  Much like David Lynch, Auster understands the importance of preserving a mystery's integrity. Absolutely my favorite novel of all time. I recommend this trilogy to anyone interested in literature in any way. The purest form of talent I have had the pleasure of reading to date.
6302814359|2.0|The main thing this film lacks,is the originality of the first one. The first &quot;Return of&quot;,was a brilliant combination of bad ironic b-movie science and logic,coupled with an EC Comics sense of humor,and a want to be a &quot;punk&quot; movie. This follow up,tries too hard to be comical,and not much else!( as opposed to Part 3,which just shovels on too much gore.) &quot;Oh no Zombies!&quot; and then wackiness ensues. It's not a total loss...it has it's good moments. James Karen,Thom Mathews,and Suzanne Snyder all return from the first film,as different characters equally doomed,whom all seem to have a sense of deja vu!It also features Dana Ashbrook,of Twin Peaks fame,in an early role. It starts off promising,but once it boils down to relying on a bratty kid and a senile comic relief doctor....it's all down hill.There's a brilliant take on Michael Jackson,in zombie form,as he gets electrocuted.( Which was met with cheering in the theater.).This film wants to be the first one,too hard,and just fails. Stick with the original,and don't go opening any olive drab drums in your basement.
0802130208|5.0|This is the kind of book that a person rarely buys on his/her own inspiration. It isn't a New York Times bestseller. It isn't one in a series. It isn't by a well-known author. And the first character the reader encounters is loud, tremendously overweight, strangely dressed and possibly mentally ill man who doesn't immediately arouse the typical reader's sympathies. If you skipped the prologue and just began reading the first page or two while standing in a bookstore, you might not even be impressed. But read just a little while longer and author Toole will have sunk his hooks into you. This book is an odd masterpiece. It's a comic tour-de-force whose characters shine. It's Seinfeld set in the seedy side of New Orleans. It's what would happen if comedian Lewis Black finally snapped and moved from Manhattan to the Creole Capital. It's absurd, but it is even more funny.<br />If you don't believe me, just read the prologue someday. Walker Percy recounts how this manuscript first came to his attention. He discusses how he tried and tried to get out of having to read it. Eventually he decided that he'd just read a few pages so that he could honestly say that it was no good and be done with it. But after picking up the script, he writes that he first endured a &quot;sinking feeling&quot; when he realized it was better than he thought; then later, he had a &quot;prickle of interest&quot;; finally, he writes, &quot;surely it was not possible that it was so good.&quot;<br />But it is that good: it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. The tragedy is that John Kennedy Toole isn't a better known author -- he killed himself in 1969. This book certainly is a fantastic way of keeping his memory alive.
0807126071|5.0|From the characterizations to the dialog to the wit - this is it. With lines like \\"The Smithsonian Institution, that grab-bag of our nation's refuse\\" to \\"the air conditioning... exhaled the Levi's carbon dioxide and cigarette smoke and ennui\\" you know this is no ordinary novel. Funny, serious, tragic, entertaining. You will simultaneously loathe and love the protagonist, one Ignatius J.Riley. I'll overlook some obvious plot loose ends, ...the book was published after his death.
0385501560|5.0|Prophetic isn't the right word, but it is the first one to come to mind.  I read &quot;Choke&quot; over the course of a week and I loved it!  Chuck Palahniuk has a gift that is beyond description for making everything he writes real.  Fight Club floored me, Survivor thrilled me, Invisible Monsters shook me, and Choke enthralled me.  For anyone out there who wants a great satirical, yet and still seriously real, read buy Choke and you won't be disappointed.<br />On a side note, after getting to meet Chuck at his first ever conference devoted to him here at Edinboro University he is what it's all about.  Real, down to earth, and damned funny!!  Chuck Palahniuk has it all...thanks for being as real in life as your writing is in soul!!
B00005AACC|2.0|I read some of the reviews complaining about the close-ups, and since I saw the movie months ago on VHS, I had sort of forgotten about them....WELL, now that that painful memory has been dreged up, my present disdain for this movie has escalated, and my rating of it has declined.  Thanks to Woo's \\"artful\\" imagery, this movie's ratings have fallen as low as Romeo Must Die and Flubber's for me.  I am saving a ONE star for something nearly lethal, but I am fortunately clever enough to never view anything THAT  bad....<br />How I hated the close-ups.  And I LIKE fashion magazines, photography, detail, art, etc...but how those close-ups irked me.  I literally began hollering out in annoyance whenever a new one sullied my TV screen, and I really thought there must be an end to them, the producer must realize he should of removed them.  But this was not the case...we still get to see them at the end of the movie.  If I recall correctly, Woo said something about focusing on the complexity of the human face....great, but just HOW complex is ONE person's face, especially in the time span of two stinking hours? Thandie Newton's pores will haunt me 'till the end of my days....
B000002ITW|4.0|This CD takes me back to a time when this kind of heart-felt songwriting was all new to me.  Just hearing the introductions to &quot;The Lee Shore&quot; and &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; can send shivers down my spine.  I disagree with the reviewer who writes that songs like &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Ohio&quot; are outdated; they stand up well as an example of songs written out of strong conviction.  Putting &quot;Find the Cost of Freedom&quot; last is a good move; it brings the album to an appropriate close.
B00000K2SD|5.0|It's true, you CAN watch this video multiple times, and still get a kick out of it.  The acting is excellent, the fight scenes are excellent, the special effects are excellent, the script is excellent, etc....<br />I'll admit, this movie doesn't create &quot;deep thought&quot; or anything--I mean, most of its concepts get hashed out in any philosophy 101 course, and you'd have to be a simpleton to not understand it.  However, the concepts ARE well-executed, usually consistent, and I am honestly looking forward to the sequals/prequals.<br />One question--if Neo was stuck in an intravenous-computer-lifepod thingy, how on earth did he even manage to thrash and keep afloat once he's released and falls into the water?  In my opinion, he should have sunk like a brick or floated lifelessly like a deflated balloon....and I am curious as to the writers' explanation of why the computers (creators of the Matrix itself) actually &quot;programmed in&quot; the Oracle and don't know about her, and is her comment about the vase going to end up as some Leibnizien version of free-will? <br />Time will tell, hopefully.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Once in a great while, a movie will come along and change the way you interpret cinema.  This is one of those movies.  I think it is one of the five best cinematic achievements of all time, and I rank it up their with such heavy hitters as The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, and The Bridge on the River Kwai.  This movie is so grand and magnificant, and the DVD makes it all the more better.  A widescreen version of the film remastered for picture quality, almost makes you want to cry when you find out it was made in 1962.  Its that good.  The sound is also great for all you people with surround, and a behind the scenes one hour documentery make this not only a great movie, but a great DVD.  I recommend this for anyone who enjoys a good historical and very entertaining movie, and good features for afterwards. Winner of Best Picture, 1962.  Starring Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness, Omar Shariff, Jack Hawkins, and Anthony Quinn.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|There's an error on Amazon's song list.  The first track should be &quot;Nature Boy,&quot; sung by David Bowie.  The song, in different versions, by the same artist, opens and closes this colorful, eclectic series of songs.  Forget about the styles of music - this CD is for anybody who enjoys imaginative, playful, and sometimes thoughtful covers and medleys of songs many of us know very well.  (Beck's cover of David Bowie's &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; might just be better than Bowie's original.  Sorry, Mr. Halloween Jack.)  And, yeah, &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; is on the CD, but ironically it's the odd-ball-out since the producer(s) and singers merely mimicked Ms. LaBelle's winning style. (A few seconds of rap isn't that amazing these days.)  Hope the movie is an entertaining as the CD.
0553213105|5.0|As much as I would like to, I don't reread books as a rule, even the most favorite, because life is short and there are a billion books to go before we sleep.  I do make an exception for PRIDE AND PREJUDICE however.  It is a masterpiece, a guiltless entertainment.  There are lots of laughs, some melodrama and romance which make it easy to knock back, like chocolate or a good wine.  There is, of course, much more to it, which makes it more than an indulgence.  Austen gets so much right:  she sets up a entire world and explains exactly how it works, what happens when it tips to its own excesses or when its players break its rules.  You could pitch a hardball at her window and it would bounce off, shattering nothing, that's how strong and clear it is.  She gets romantic love right, as well as all the mistakes everyone makes trying to get it right.  She spears bad behavior and holds it up on a stick.  She is very witty but never casual.  She burns up the page with truth-about her society, family interactions, human nature and the fact that no matter how civilized we become, we as a species are still at square one when it comes to managing the heart.  I see that some younger readers don't appreciate the depths this novel or its relevance for contemporary life:  maybe it's the way it is being (not) taught, but it could also be that readers have to be ready to appreciate the idea of an insular world that can bear timeless truths, and for younger adolescents, the world as yet has no edges but truth is limited to immediate circumstances.
B00003CXN4|5.0|First of all, if you haven't seen it yet, see it! And if you have seen it, see it again! This is about the drug-wars (I don't want to give too much away) but this movie is one of the most realistic movies you will ever see. The acting is phenomenal. One of best movies of decade!
0553573403|5.0|I had wanted to get back into reading a truely great fantasy series, but I was wary of endless pages in an endless story that went nowhere.  A Game of Thrones delivers, and delivers amazingly well.  Fast-paced, suspenseful, funny.  I highly, highly, highly recommend this book!  BUY IT NOW.
0385501560|3.0|Tried to think of one word to sum this book up, and I couldn't. My rankings for his 4 books go like this: 1. Survivor 2. Fight Club 3 Invisible Monsters 4  Choke. Not to say choke is the worst, because I'll take Choke over a bunch of the [crud] that is out there today. I just wasn't drawn in as much as I was the other stories. As it was with his other books, I love the style in which he writes, but after 150 pages or so, you hit that HUH????!?!?! point. And typically with about 20 pages to go a bombshell is dropped. Another is dropped with about 5 pages to go. Does it all work? Yes. Is it fresh and unique, maybe. The sex addict scenes are very amusing, as are the colonial towns as well. At some point though, I'm wondering when Chuck will take a different approach that is not in the things must get worse before they can get better mode. All in all though, I found this book to be entertaining and a quick read. Now have to wait until the next one comes out.
B00005J6UP|5.0|It's a shame that someone has ruined this movie from a 5 star status.  It deserves every-bit of it.  Every time this movie comes on T.V. I am glued.  This is a perfect example of how to make a fun movie.  I felt like a kid again to know it was coming out on DVD.  There are not many movies at all made like this.
0784010501|4.0|Being a huge Madonna fan, once I finally got my DVD player and figured out how to play Region 1 DVDs (I live in Europe), Truth or Dare was my first Region 1 purchase.  I hadn't seen the film for a few years - my VHS copy had seen better days, especially the songs, so it was with great anticipation that I waited for the DVD to arrive.  And ... well, it's ok.  The film itself is still as good as I remember it being, but I have to say I'm a more than a little disappointed with the transfer.  Another reviewer mentioned the grainy b&amp;w footage, but it was shot that way.  My problem is that, in certain sections, the dialogue doesn't match the mouths.  It's a little strange, and more than a little annoying.  Why is this?!  Other than that, a fantastic film.  Watching her entourage suck up to her is cringeworthy.  Watching the concert footage from the Blond Ambition tour is just amazing.  And another bonus for someone living in Europe is that the film plays at the proper speed.  The European version, In Bed With Madonna, ran a little faster, meaning that when she spoke her voice took on a helium-like effect, and the songs zipped by super fast.  This is great.  So, that's all.  The film is worth 5 stars, but because of the bad transfer and lack of extras (2 crummy trailers - one with bad sound), I'll only give it 4.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|By far the most amazing film I've seen in years. Every aspect of this production is perfect. McGregor and Kidman are perfectly cast and have awesome voices. If you love movies, you must see this. You will be dazzeled.
B000021Y7X|1.0|I loved Stop Making Sense when I saw it in the cinema many years ago. Unfortunately, the DVD cannot be played on our DVD player (Sony PlayStation 2) and I had to return it to the shop for a refund. The shopkeeper said dozens of copies had been returned because the DVD is incompatible with several different DVD players. Why make a DVD that cannot be viewed by all normal machines? The irony is that this DVD is distributed in Canada by Sony Music and cannot be played on a Sony PS2.
B00005A1PR|5.0|india's song video is just beutiful! <br />i ordered this album now, and i really looking forward to it...<br />i hope the other tracks are as good as video.
0783240287|4.0|..a little light on plot...but that does not mean it is not enjoyable.  It is very enjoyable and colorful and just a LOT of fun.  Donny Osmond is amazing and most of the staging is very much like the touring companies that I saw a year or two ago.  The difference is that there is a documentary side that tells about  how &quot;Joseph&quot; came about...and how it is very frequently produced in schools (in this case, schools in Britain).  Most of us are aware, after all, that &quot;Joseph&quot; is really about forty minutes worth of material..padded out handsomely with production and glitz.  It is also nicely paced and very energetic.  And, if you need further enticement... Joan Collins is here in several guises..but mostly being her naughty self.
B0000028UK|5.0|I think the world was pretty much awestruck by the originality of &quot;Ten&quot;, and this album is a prime follow-up.   Very political in nature and emotionally charged in every aspect.  I don't perceive Pearl Jam as being the best musicians around, but their lyrics and melodies just hit home.  This album is definitely no exception and will pave Pearl Jam's road to a very secure place in revolutionary rock history.  If you don't own this piece, I easily recommend it alongside &quot;Ten&quot;.
B00005BL2A|2.0|The 4th of April was a great day for me because I heard that Depeche Mode were releasing an album called 'Exciter' on the 15th of May.  Ultimately the album offered little.  The mood created by the songs is a stark contrast to that suggested by the album's name.  Now, I've been a DM fan for a long time, and I've loved almost everything they've put out.  This time though, I had trouble liking most of the tunes they came up with.  Sometimes you'll listen to a song for the first time and not like it.  But then, if you hear it a couple of times, it starts to grow on you.  No such luck this time.  Sorry DM.
0345404475|4.0|After reading some of the other reviews here and then the book itself, I have some thoughts on, &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; (DADOES). This is the second Philip K. Dick novel that I've ever read (the other being, &quot;The Divine Invasion,&quot; which I have reviewed).<br />I think Dick really explores the question of what human means in this novel. His main character, Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter for the San Francisco Police. He hunts renegade androids who have escaped from colony worlds (i.e Mars) and &quot;retires&quot; (kills) them. However, before he can retire the androids, he must verify that they are indeed androids. At this point, Deckard must administer the Voigt-Kampff Empathy Test, which measures instinctive emotional reactions to questions. As androids were designed without emotive capabilities (to distinguish them from humans; it seems they are otherwise indistinguishable), this is one of the few ways to identify them. Unfortunately, information emerges that says that sub-normal human with impaired emotions could fail the test and thus be retired. I wish Dick had Deckard come to a scenario where he was very unsure about the status of someone standing before him, where he might have to take a chance...<br />The setting of the novel is after what is called, &quot;World War Terminus,&quot; in 2019. The World War Terminus seems to be some sort of global nuclear war, which has coated the planet in radioactive dust, which slowly killed many of the Earth's animals. \\"The legacy of World War Terminus had diminished in potency; those who could not survive the dust had passed into oblivion years ago, and the dust, weaker now and confronting the strong survivors, only deranged minds and genetic properties.\\" (page 8)  It retards humans, renders them infertile, ages them faster and has other non-lethal effects. I would have liked to know more about this fictional future war. One of the interesting historical quirks in the novel is that Dick predicted that the Soviet Union would still be in existence in 2019; of course one must keep in mind that Dick wrote the novel in 1968 (a 51 year projection).<br />In this future decaying Earth, the mass media is still enormously influential. There are two main parties competing for human allegiance. There is \\"Buster Friendly\\" who is some sort of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week comedy television program and then there is Wilbur Mercer. Mercer is part of the futuristic religion of Mercerism; Dick largely leaves Mercerism unexplored. Mercer acts as a guide for Decker but says he does have all the answers... Buster Friendly then exposes Mercer as a Hollywood-produced fake. Even after this, Mercer is still there. The main purpose of Mercerism seems to be experiencing an emotional fusion with Mercer who suffers some sort of on-going persecution. <br />To look at the title, it is necessary to go into the novel in some detail. The radioactive dust killed the gross majority of Earth animals rather quickly, so owning a real living animal is considered a major status symbol. As the animals are incredibly expensive, many people buy \\"electric\\" (i.e. synthetic, copies; analogous to the human/android contrast in the novel) animals as a substitute. The title is meant to express the paradoxical idea of whether synthetic humans (in one case of the novel, an android did not know it was, in fact, an android) dream of possessing synthetic animals.          <br />To look at Ridley Scott's interpretation of the novel in, \\"Blade Runner,\\" (1982) will be next. As other reviewers have said, it is perhaps perhaps more accurate to say that the novel inspired the film rather than the film being based on the novel. I will look at differences and the pro's and cons of it.<br />There were some substantial changes; the role of Roy Batty is significantly expanded. In the novel, he leads the last of the Nexus-6 androids (a new class of androids who can almost beat the Voigt-Kampff test). In the film andthe novel, the lifespan of androids of set at four years. In the novel, it seems to be an arbitrary limit whereas in the film a cogent explanation is given. In the film, it is feared that after four years the androids (called replicants in the film; it carries more of a mass-produced ring to it) start to have emotional capabilities and would thus be able to blend in with humans. As a failsafe, the massive corporation that builds androids (Rosen Association in the novel, Rand in the film, I think) programmed their DNA to stop replicating after 4 years and thus any dead cells would not be replaced, leading to eventual death. The setting of the film is Los Angeles rather than San Francisco and I had a totally different mental picture of what Earth would look like. In the novel, one gets the impression that there are only a few thousand people on the planet, which is decaying away into nothing due to the dust. In the film, L.A. is a vibrant, somewhat decaying city where there is massive pollution but no dust. Generally, I didn't like the film though this may be simply because I'm not used to or a fan of the film noir genre. <br />Near the end of the film, Deckard has to fight Roy Batty to retire him. In the novel, Roy just stands there and gets blasted. After some chasing, fighting and so on, there is the best scene of the whole film where Deckard is hanging onto a building by his fingertips about to fall off and Roy Batty is watching and then Roy catches Deckard just as he looses grip. Roy Batty then has the best lines of the film where he talks about life and then dies, as he is at the end of his four years. The great irony is that the hunted replicant ends up saving Deckard, his hunter who only knew his quarry due to a lack of emotions.
B00005BJPO|5.0|Pioneer has done an excellent job with this film.  THX certified and it includes the original Japanese audio track, not to mention extras on a second disc.<br />As for the film itself it's a flawed classic, and in part it's those flaws that keep people coming back to it.  A highly ambitious project as well, condesing over a thousand pages of story into a film that runs less than 2.5 hours, but amazingly, much of the feel comes through.<br />The goofball below who gives the film one star is a fool.  Even if you didn't like the story there is so much here that is excellent that to give it one star (basically calling it trash) is a travesty.  I figure between an excellent double disc set and a classic of animation it's a must own, so I give it five stars.
B00003CXP1|1.0|The key to making a truly moving anti-drug film is creating characters about whom the audience cares deeply.  With the exception of the elderly mother (Ellen Burstyn), none of the other characters in the film compelled me to care about their lives.  This is not to say that all characters must be likeable---just interesting.  Unfortunately, this film confuses &quot;shocking&quot; with &quot;interesting,&quot; and the plot suffers greatly, bouncing back and forth between played-out cliches and attempts to shock the viewer into caring.  The direction makes the film watchable, but why settle for that when there are other films that are go beyond passibly watchable?  Some critics argue that Requiem for a Dream is a good film because it shows a gritty, bleak sense of hoplessness that flows through the lives of all addicts.  So what?  Grittiness does not replace basic human emotion. Burstyn is good, but she can't pull the entire film by herself.  The raved-about refrigerator scene borders on silliness.  If you want to watch a gimmicky, fashionably dark film about boring people who get what they deserve, by all means, watch Requiem for a Dream.
6305079900|5.0|Most people want the very best out of their DVDs.  I'm all for the extra features and superior sound.  The Terminator on DVD doesn't have fantastic audio or extra features.  What it does have is an excellent sci-fi movie presented in its orignal theatrical form, which includes its mono soundtrack.  Sometimes less is more, and having nothing at all is worse.  This is a must have DVD for any HARD CORE collector.  Even if they do release a Special Edtion with all the goodies, its nice to have the old edition, in its original splendor (if you can find it).  But that's just me.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|The lack of the \\"DANJAC\\" (Albert Broccoli) 007 Music & opening credits are the only thing about this movie that could have been better. I say Cheers to Kevin McClory for creating the anti-Bond  charchters, SPECTRE, BLOFELD & his kitty, and for having the guts to go up against MEGA movie makers \\"Broccoli & Co.\\" and make this last Good James Bond Movie. To me 1983 was the last year James Bond was really James Bond. Now he's ...politically correct, which I am sure makes Ian Fleming turn over in his grave. All 7 of Connery's Bond's are Great, Moore's 1st 5 Bond's are very good, his last 2 were Stinko, all of Dalton's, Brosnan's & Mr. Lazenby's solo, all make my stomach hurt. Thanks Mr. McClory! Good Luck on a 2nd remake effort in 2001!
B000001EUP|5.0|This is not only the Scorpions finest work, but simply one of the best High Energy rock and roll records ever recorded. I'd say this is as good as Judas Priest's &quot;British Steel&quot;, UFO's &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;, Riot's &quot;Fire Down Under&quot; or any one of the classic heavy rock/high energy records of all time.<br />&quot;Blackout&quot; is perfect from start to finish, the kind of record people of a certain age (29 and above?) can sing every word to, as we all had this sitting in the cassette deck at one time or another in the mid eighties...<br />The Scorpions, like AC/DC, can come off as a pretty silly band at times, but like AC/DC with &quot;Back in Black&quot;,  produced one classic album with &quot;Blackout&quot;...I can't imagine not having this in my collection, even if I only listen to it once a year.<br />The title song, &quot;Can't live without you&quot;, &quot;Now!&quot;, &quot;Arizona&quot;...man, these are all great rockers...even the ballads are top notch, and the Scorpions have always been known for quality of both the headbanging blasters as well as the romantic mid tempo ones..this is the best example of their prowess.<br />If owning a Scorps record in the new Millenium seems passe, Get over your hipness...you know you loved this before, and I guarantee you will again...great stuff...Long may the Scorpions rock! Tschuss!!!
B0000025ZK|5.0|David Gilmour's second solo effort is the most mainstream of any floyd albums in whatever form. The key to liking this album is not to view it as a floyd album - though i'm a great floyd fan - but in it's own light. It has its faults - patchy songwriting, especially blue light and near the end and a sound close to pop. No great guitar solos either unlike his earlier solo effort. <br />However the melodies are great. The best songs on the album are love on the air, murder(the only decent lyrics written by gilmour)and cruise. Pete Townshend and Steve Winwood make cameo appearances. Also no fillers here, all the songs are nice,  light and tend to grow on you. <br />The album misses Water's biting lyrics and will be hated by those who think floyd ended with Waters but if you liked the Division Bell and momentary Lapse you'll definitely enjoy this one. Personally just to give a floyd comparison i think it's better than lapse though not as good as division bell.
B000059HGY|4.0|Tora! Tora! Tora is a very well-done movie about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. While some events are not historically correct, and some roles and events could have been expanded, the movie overall is very good.<br />The movie does a good job of portraying the events prior to the attack, although it sometimes leaves the timing of events to the imagination. Some events occuring in quick succession in the movie actually occured over a fairly long period of time.<br />The attack scenes were well-done and fairly accurate. The special effects were done quite well, considering the technology available at the time. I would have preferred to have seen more story lines about individual acts of heroism, of which there were many, but that should not be considered a criticism. <br />Martin Balsam is superb in his role as Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Commander of the Pacific Fleet. Jason Robards, Jr., comes off a little stuffy, but otherwise believeable, in his role as General Walter Short, commander of Army forces in Hawaii. James Whitmore deserves commendation for his role as Admiral William &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey.<br />Overall this is a very good movie and should be in the library of anyone with an interest in the attack.  But it should be remembered by everyone watching the film that it is a drama, not a documentary.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The movie the goonies is the best movie ever made! This movie not only inspired me in life, but everyone I have ever know loves this movie and says that this movie changed their life some way too! I could go up to almost any kid at any school and ask them if they have seen this movie and they will say yes, thats the best movie ever! I say buy this movie today because it is a must see, and if you have never seen this movie you dont know what your missing.
B00005B1EX|5.0|Although I had given up hopes of ever getting excited about a live record again, I was shocked by how good this record is.  I expected another schlocky throwaway from another metaller past his prime, but this record is tremendous.<br />Yeah, there's probably a serious amount of overdubbing, but who really cares when the final production is this crisp and powerful?  A MUST BUY for Priest fans.
0312243022|3.0|The author spins melifluous prose around increasingly episodic longueurs, captured by the author's own reflection on p. 130: &quot;You're in perfect agreement with almost every critic. That'd waited all that time, and for what? More than nine hundred pages of flirtation, really, with a suddent death at the end. People did say it was beautifully written.&quot; This book is a only 200 hundred pages, but midway begins to feel like the 1000-page book the author adumbrates, presciently describing what I suspect he thought others would say about *this book.
B00003CXE7|3.0|The movie is obviously full of historical inaccuracies and the combat scenes are obviously highly stylized, but hey, it's a movie. I can't speak for everyone, but I watch movies for entertainment, not enlightenment. On that note, this was a pretty good movie. A little long, and some of the dialog was a bit too melodramatic, but you can definitely waste a couple hours on worse fare.
0783117523|4.0|...and that something has a name: Rocco. What I would have liked to see, about three-quarters of the way through this film, is some sort of contribution from the well-known actor and director Rocco Siffredi, similar to what he did for Catherine Breillat's &lt;Romance&gt;. It would have been a real challenge to Angelina as an actor to completly shift modes, to recast the part in a more challenging way.<br />Certainly worth a look regardless.
B000000OQF|5.0|Epic and essential. Guns and Roses' first major label release, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; was released in 1987, and quickly became one of the best selling albums ever--something like 25 million copies sold worldwide. This album is very hard rock, and for it to have become such a commercial success, you have to trust that the album sales are an accurate reflection of its quality. Axl's characteristic screeching voice, and very deft lyric writing, coupled with one of the greatest guitarists in rock and roll, Slash, make this an extremely well-composed and energetic album. &quot;Welcome to the Jungle,&quot; &quot;Sweet Child of Mine,&quot; and &quot;Paradise City&quot; absolutely tore up the charts when they were released as singles; standing alone, they would make this one of the top 20 rock albums ever, but they merely scratch the surface of tremendous musical creativity and power. &quot;Rocket Queen&quot; is one of the very best songs the band ever wrote. It has a very solid, bass heavy introduction, with lyrics wreaking of a lustful depravity, before segueing into the second part of the song, perhaps one of the finest ballads the band has written. Other standouts include &quot;Mr. Brownstone,&quot; with Axl assuming a detached vocal inflection only to be eaten up by his heroin addiction by the song's end; &quot;My Michelle&quot; is a heart-racing, fast paced journey through the life of a young girl (apparently a &quot;true&quot; story), and &quot;Think About You,&quot; a well-crafted ballad that was perhaps a little too fast for a radio release. This album is worth every penny. In a way, it is also a piece of history-a definitive album for the time when hair bands ruled the earth. One cannot understate its importance...if any band has the capability to bring rock and roll back to the forefront of modern music, it is Guns and Roses.
6304167660|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over. It's light enough to where you don't get tired out watching it, but it's so full of everything I look for in a movie! The acting is great, the characters are real, the writing and humor is &quot;superb.&quot; I especially loved (like everyone else) the interactions between portman and hutton, because it is realistic and you don't look at them as something disgusting... things like that could happen and they do.<br />Michael Rappaport was hilarious with his obsession with supermodels and St. Bernard named &quot;Elle.&quot; ... &quot;they're all sisters, Will.... leave it alone.&quot;<br />This is not only a &quot;girl&quot; movie, or a &quot;date&quot; movie, its an everyone movie because its true to life full of guys that can't commit, girls with low self esteem trying to hold onto their men, and guys that just want &quot;something beautiful&quot; and will go to the ends of the earth to get it.<br />One of my faaaaaaaaaaavoritees! see it!

B00004ZEQX|5.0|Another one of the vaguely Lovecraftian italian horrors from Lucio Fulci (see also Gates of Hell and The Beyond). The format has evolved from his previous outings of hordes of zombies to a spookier, phsychic-ghost story instead. In fact, it's kind of a cheap-skate version of The Shining.<br />To really appreciate this film (or any of Fulci's horror films) you have to be prepared to forgive a lot of cinematic badness. Dubbing, dialogue, plot coherence, the occasional dodgy special effect (not so bad in this film - no one can forgive the toy spiders in The Beyond) ... as a matter of fact, you may wonder what's so great about this film at all. Well, I'll tell you ... Fulci is a master cinematographic &quot;painter&quot;. Scenes look gorgeous, and they really suit the feel of this gothic film. Also, Fulci has a habit of pulling something really shocking out of the hat at a moment's notice (you'll know it when you see it - let's just say in this film it involved a child's head, a door and an axe). But what really turns on the legion of Fulci fans out there is the gore. Set piece, outrageous gore scenes pop up ever fifteen to twenty minutes as minor characters walk on only to get bumped off in various splattery ways. House isn't as gory as his earlier zombie films but it's still pretty hard. (BTW - although the case says Rated: R, this is the uncut version of the film.)<br />Oh yeah, and Catriona MacColl is in it.<br />You either &quot;get&quot; Fulci films or you don't. If you're prepared to willfully ignore the technically bad aspects of the film, you'll be rewarded with a rich, bloody, gothic horror classic. Films like this will never be made again.
B00005KHLV|5.0|This is a tale of how delicate love can be even in exceptional circumstances. Ironically the Latin soundtrack fits the mood perfectly and the film has a virtual flavor about it. A great date film. Beautiful cinematography. A first rate film all around.
B000002J5K|5.0|As a fan of the blues and the Blues Brothers, this one is pure enjoyment. This collection is much better than the other 2 records they put out.
B00003CXRP|2.0|I went to this movie because I'm a Hanks fan. First I like to say that the sound of this movie is great, but thats (almost)all. The first half hour is one big FedEx commercial. Then there is the plane crash, that one is really great, I think the second best (I think the best is in Final Destination). Only.....you can see that the plane which crashes is a boeing 777, and..............those do NOT crash.  I think that Tom Hanks is great, but I think he will never be as good as Forrest Gump.
B000000I3O|5.0|This album could be titled The Best Of The Misfits, as it contains nothing but the very best songs of this great punk band. If you think Blink 182 and GreenDay are true punk bands, correct your misunderstandings by listening to this album -The Misfits were real punk, unlike the waterdowned, MTV psuedo-punk bands so many people mistakenly like. This album is one of the most important punk albums ever made.
B0000029DD|5.0|This CD made it to my \\"10-all-time-favorites-list\\" after listening to track one. Maybe on the surface, that's not saying a lot - but given the fact that my record collection stands at over 30,000 - it speaks volumes.<br />Sad, Deep, True....A heavy piece of work!
B000059HAI|5.0|amid all the accolades for special effects, let's not forget the characters themselves. Both directors were meticulous in their portrayals of the leading figures. The character studies are wonderfully depicted, as to show the unique complexities that each one revealed. We are intimately familiar with them, even down to the aircraft mechanics on the Japanese carriers. We relate to each one of them somehow. They are fully human to us. They are not faceless, emotionless, unhuman individuals: We connect to both sides' angst, fear, indifference, euphoria and resignation. For example, I feel the pure euphoric intensity each time I see the scene where Commander Fuchida, flight leader of the first wave, peers thur his binoculars at the harbor to check for enemy aircraft, and states &quot;We've done it&quot;. Complete Surprise achieved. Or how about Martin Balsam, playing Adm. Kimmel, viewing the carnage from his window, and an errant bullet shatters the pane, just missing him: &quot;It would have been merciful, had it killed me.&quot; A fortelling of his ignoble demise. Lastly, let's not forget the scene in which a young Japanese boy is sending off a letter and hands it to the clerk, who pauses to eye him menacingly. The camara sits just long enough on the boy's innocent face. That's all it took to convey the subtle racism that reminds you powerfully of the American shame of the indignant incarceration of Japanese Americans during the war. This film was more than special effects. It's a superb character study that brilliantly portrays the known and unknown people in such a way as to not pass judgement, but to display them in their attempt to cope with the uncontrolled forces of fate and history.
6305972591|1.0|Maybe I'm a little biased after reading the excellent King short story upon which this movie is based... or maybe this movie just really sucks. Whichever, by the goofy climax of this wanna-be horror flick, I was feeling more than a little let down. Why is it that so many King adaptations fail so miserably? I can understand the difficulty in translating King's superlative prose into a feature film, but why must the acting be so bad. And why why why does the creepy atmosphere of the story have to be completely destroyed? I'll give you an example: in King's writing, the great creature at the end (He Who Walks Behind the Rows) is a genuinely frightening entity (I won't give away too much). However, in the film, this beast is portrayed as a stupid, hokey &quot;force&quot; (probably due to budget restrictions)... I dunno.. maybe I'm taking it all a little too seriously, and if I am I apologize. Still, I'd reccomend seeing the film before you read the story. That way can enjoy it's senseless violence without feeling a longing for King's true ability.
0375703764|5.0|I almost hesitated to add my thoughts to the reviews listed on this book, but after reading the most recent contributions here I thought it important to say something now, while I'm still in the &quot;impassioned and excited&quot; stage of discovering the narrative.<br />A few of the reviews you'll read below are obviously from academics--as a &quot;refugee&quot; from that world, i recognize their voices anywhere. They tend to take text much to seriously, deconstructing on a level that the average reader just doesn't comprehend or care about. Sort of like listening to Chopin and arguing about someone's technique.<br />However, the irony is it is only someone who has been part of that academic madness who can appreciate the full scope of what is going on in this book--the endless citations, and references, appendixes, and superficially meaningless trivia. The intent is to create a literary dissertation, so convinced of its own truth that the reader is fooled into thinking it is fact.<br />That is not to say that it is not good popular fiction; on the contrary, it is emotionally gripping and terrifying in how it speaks to the soul. But the plot is not the relevant focal point, and whether or not we buy the mystery of the house and the terror it inspires--real or imagined--is not what &quot;sells&quot; the piece. Instead it is the details, the little things that are almost lost in the grandness of this experiment. Like a lonely woman who practices her smile in the mirror. An irrational fear of space where you swear something is coming for you, but it never does. It is a narrative of moments. The concept reminds me of the novel &quot;The Hours,&quot; only instead of happiness being seized in the small details, it is terror.<br />As a scholar, I am in awe of what Danielewski has accomplished, but as a woman who has woke up in the middle of the night swearing I've just seen the shadow of something pass over my bed--I'm not so much terrified as relieved that I'm not alonein that paranoia. <br />All that said, I will put this as simple as I can: This is the first book in a long time I not only couldn't put down, but was excited enough to recommend to my friends--and to you now as well.
B00005ASOI|4.0|This is a truly elegant piece of art horror, and is, without a doubt one of the scariest films I have ever seen. The eerie (if a little thin) plot involves a coven of witches who own a classy ballet school.  However, it is the brilliant use of the camera that truly creates a sense of dread and fear. And, to add to the menacing quality of the visuals is a truly fantastic (and relentlessly disturbing) musical score by Itallian rock band Goblin. The only element of Suspiria that dissapointed me was the slightly watered-down ending, which seemed rather rushed and blunt when compared to the slow-building terror of the rest of the film. However, by that time you'll be so thrilled and horrified by the superb first half that this will hardly matter. In conclusion, this is a classic and a must-see. (I also highly recommend the soundtrack!)
B000002UAX|5.0|this cd is flawless with its collection of rare and unique beatles songs. Its a must for any classic rock collection. This is one of my favorite cd's ever. Its worth the ...if your new to this cd if youve heard this album then you probably own it. Also i recomend RUBBER SOUL and BEACH BOYS - PET SOUNDS if your putting together a serious collection
078322608X|5.0|In a word, this film is a masterpiece... It is a work of incredible beauty and complexity that can be enjoyed many times over. It is a sci-fi epic that manages to be both cynical and hopeful at the same time. It thrills with it's crazy style and entertains with it's outstanding performances (it's the film that transformed me into a Brad Pitt fan, which was reinforced by Fight Club)... From the opening credits with it's creepy accordian theme, to the last ethereal moment, this is a movie to be savored.
B000002UAO|5.0|This cd is an important cd to have in your collection its in this album that the Beatles started to head in the direction of their later efforts.

6305531374|5.0|I think this is a much better Halloween movie than all of them except for the very first one! I was so glad to see Jamie Lee Curtis back! She was the original star and she should have been in all of them! I don't care if Halloween H20 ignores the rest of the Halloween movies after the second one; the first, second, and third movie are the true series. I liked everything about H20. I liked the whole idea of Laurie Strode hiding away with her son in this secluded private school. Josh Hartnett did a wonderful acting job, as did Michelle Williams (his girlfriend.) H20 is very different from the other Halloween films, but it still has the suspense that only a Halloween movie can bring. As for the DVD itself, if you love special features than you're sure to enjoy it.

For that matter, read any history books recently?<br />Forget it all.  <br />It took about 400 pages, but Dee Brown has shown me that what I know of American history is bunk.  This is the truth behind our heritage and our country.  <br />Here is the story of the systematic destruction of an entire people.  Thousands and thousands of lives lost to lies, racism, hate, greed, and stupidity.  All so the U-S could have more and more and more land.  The house you live in is built on land won at the cost of an Indian tribe.  Chilling to say the least.<br />Brown's writing is so objective it feels nearly disconnected and remote.  And for good reason.  You can decide for yourself how horrible the truth is. Brown doesn't need to garnish the facts with commentary.<br />Highly recommended, and nearly perfect.  I only wish the book included map platelets so I could more easily understand the many battles, tribal exoduses, treaty promises, etc.
B00003CXN4|1.0|In a movie where the plot goes absolutly no where, I am not one be a big fan.  Although it did have a unique and interested look with the cinematography and the color symbolsim between American and Mexico was a very dramatic and interesting choice, I did not feel that this movie was worth any ones time.  It was very dry and lacking in plot and acting.  The story went absolutly nowhere!  This is the type of movie where I find myself being the annoying movie patron just to entertain myself for the extent of the filth on screen.  In direction and cinematography I would give it 4 stars.  However, because of it's lack of anyting else I am forced to give it only one.  Give me plot or give me death! -The Justin B Scale of Overcriticalness
158234082X|5.0|I have been in the business for 40 years plus as a dishwasher, chef, owner and all steps inbetween. Bourdian has it nailed to the wall, his style aint bad either! Great read even if a bit scary for the uninitiated. heheheheh
B00003CXN4|4.0|I RENTED TRAFFIC BECAUSE I NEVER GOT TO SEE IT IN THE MOVIES. I EXPECTED TO WATCH SOME ONE NIGHT THEN WATCH THE REST LATER ON BUT BY MIDNIGHT ON A WORK NIGHT I FOUND I COULDNT SHUT THE DVD PLAYER. MANY STORIES GOING ON ALL AT ONCE AND ALL INTERESTING. THE ACTING VERY NATURAL, THE MIXTURE OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF PEOPLE ALL FACING SIMILAR PROBLEMS WAS VERY INTRIGING. SO I LOST SOME SLEEP BUT HOW CAN I HAVE SHUT IT OFF?
0783222955|5.0|I was quite young the first time I saw this movie -- something tells me I actually saw it on the big screen.  I do remember seeing it on TV a time or two when I was young.  Eventually I read the book and came to enjoy and understand the movie more over the years. I hadn't seen it in many years when the 30th anniversary edition came out in the 90s, so I purchased one and eagerly watched it again.  It was even better than I had remembered.  I've read many of the reviews on here, but no one has mentioned the rather haunting music that accompanies part of the film.  To me, that helped set the overall mood along with the photography and the fine fine acting.  The film also evokes the an era when racial tolerance in the south was very limited -- but produced at a time when the civil rights movement was gathering momentum.  See it through those lenses and it becomes a film that's not so much dated as reflective of the past, both the good and bad parts.
B000002LCI|5.0|This is, by far, the best DM album EVER!!!!  I can't say enough great things about this album!  &quot;Strangelove&quot; has got to be one of my favorite DM songs from their entire repetoire.  If you don't have MFTM, then get off your butt and go pick it up TODAY!!!
B000000H57|5.0|I used to hate these guys but I was totally off base.  How can a person hate a CD one minute and love it the next?  I'll tell you why -- bands like TON are not for everyone, and for many they will take a while to get used to.  I love the guitar on this (and all of their) CDs -- not loud, but very distorted.  Pete Steele's vocal range is amazing, esp. on the 1st track.  Fans of TON understand exactly what I am saying.  Also check out \\"Bloody Kisses\\" and \\"World Coming Down\\" -- both are excellent.
B000002KYR|5.0|This is just one great party cd.Wish i had a nickel for every time i got riped listening ti this great cd.This is probably zz tops 3rd best cd,with treshombres being 1,fandango2,so that is saying quite a bit.To this day i find myself playing this cd alot.When i find myself in a down mood,it always picks me up.This has the great songs give me all your lovin,thug and i got the six,just cranking good songs,unlike there new songs on xxx,which are 95% trash.I have seen these guys in concert and they were fantastic.If you don`t have this cd buy  it right away.
B0000032LS|5.0|This is truly timeless music because the songs are so good, dammit! You don't even need to have see the movie to enjoy this as a great pop-rock album, but  I recommend you do. Every singly track has something going for it, and they are all memorable, with soaring melodies and stunning vocals. There's real old-time rock `n roll like Hot Patootie, Eddie (\\"When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy/You knew he was a no-good kid,\\" Uptempo pop-rock like Dammit Janet, Sweet Transvestite, Touch-A Touch Me and poignant ballads like Science Fiction, Over At The Frankenstein Place, I'm Going Home and Super Heroes. It's a delight from beginning to end.
B00005BL2A|3.0|This cd really misses the mark.One of the songs on this is called comatose,that is what this cd leaves me.Sleepy and bored.Where is the talent in this bomb.Two good songs on this are dream on and shine,every thing else is throw away,or should i say throw up.Avoid this disaster.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I include this album amongst the Top 5 best albums of the 90s with no hesitation. The broad sweep of her talent is displayed in a remarkably versatile collection of songs, all infused with that &quot;something special.&quot; Although some numbers are structurally complex, most of them are blessed with hummable melodies and scorching hooks. This is the cream of rock music: passionate, intelligent, melodic, played with expertise and gusto. My favourites include Front Row, Thank U, Are You Still Mad, That I Would Be Good, U R, I Was hoping, and the delirious So Pure. I find myself returning to this album again and again for more listening pleasure.
B000002WYT|5.0|Uno de los mejores discos que he odo jams, es increible la fusin que llega a conseguir la banda, que compenetracin, que armonas, que texturas instrumentales, que climax, es apotesico. Temas como &quot;Two Step&quot;, &quot;41&quot;, o &quot;Drive in, drive out&quot;, son algunas de las pequeas joyas que contiene este maravilloso disco. Uno de mis mejores descubrimientos.
0553212737|4.0|After reading this novel, I realized how entertaining/touching  an old book could actually be.  The story was about a woman (Emma) who despised marriage, and felt that there was no need to dedicate  her  life to only one person. I felt that Emma was a  very strong character, she knew what she wanted  and would not let anyone alter her decision about marriage. However, at the end of the novel the  character succumbs to societal pressures and marries  the man (Mr. Knightely) that desires her companionship. That shows that her character's personality is not as strong as it seems. Throughout the whole novel she lets the reader believe that nobody could ever modify her view on marriage. Yet, I feel that the love story was  very touching, not many people are dedicated to a person to the point where they will wait for them for as long as needed. Love conquers all is a saying that I have always wished to be true, but never thought that it was possible. Emma swore that she would never change her mind on this issue, but after admitting to herself that she was in love with this man, she desired to be with him as much as he did with her. After reading this novel, I realized that people can have soul mates, and that if you really love someone, never let them go because you never know what will happen. I feel that everyone should read this book, because even though it was written over a century ago, individuals now are able to read it and feel like they can relate to the characters, at least I felt that I could.
B00005B5L4|5.0|One word: Awesome! Buy this and enjoy Rumours like you never have before - in multi-channel surround sound.<br />    The audio quality is stunning. A quick A/B comparison of this to the CD you've listened to a billion times reveals that there is really no comparison. This DVD Audio disk is the gold standard. It's the Beatles of multi-channel music. Everything sounds better. You will definitely hear things you have never heard before. In some cases instruments have been left in that were originally left out - I'll just say get ready for a cool surprise in Never Going Back Again. In another case something has been left out, such as the breaking glass during the fade of Gold Dust Woman. While not a major omission, it would have been nice to hear it in the surround speakers.<br /> The mixes are brilliant and bring out the glory of this classic album. The 5.1 Entertainment Group, and Ken Caillat in particular should be given a big, fat slap on the back for this well done job. Many times people who mix surround-sound music treat it like a sort of glorified stereo. They are afraid to place instruments around you. Fortunately for the listener, that's not the case here. Caillat has no problem placing guitars, vocals, and other instruments in the surround speakers. And, he does it in a way that's not distracting to the listener; it's subtle yet noticeable. I would love to hear Tusk or Lindsey Buckingham's Out of the Cradle mixed this way.     <br />     By the way, there are actually three (3) mixes of the album on this disk. One is the DVD Audio surround mix, which they say is the best sound quality because of the sample rate. The second is an advanced resolution stereo mix. And, the third is the Dolby Digital surround mix. This is the one that I listen to because I don't have a DVD Audio player. It's also the one most people will hear until DVD Audio players become popular. This disk will not play in a CD player. But, it's not supposed to.<br />      One of the neat features of this DVD Audio disk is the track-by-track commentary from band members. Each song plays without vocals as they talk about the track. In a few cases you hear early versions of the song and some demos - in 5.1! If you have your TV on while the disk is playing you see a photomontage of Fleetwood Mac with the rundown of instruments used on each song. I wish there was a section where you could hear the entire song without vocals and commentary, but that's just me. It in no way takes away from this great disk.  <br />    Another pleasant bonus is the inclusion of Silver Springs. It has been added to the track line-up between Go Your Own Way and The Chain. And, just like the rest of the disk, the guitars and other instruments (including vocals) shimmer in a way you've never heard.  <br />    If you have a DVD player with a Dolby Digital surround sound system (common these days) and love Fleetwood Mac, get this disk immediately. You will experience Rumours like you never have before.
B00005J79H|4.0|Good live unplugged set from the German rockers. Recorded earlier this year on Feb. in Portugal. Featuring most of their hit songs plus their new single, &quot;When Love Kills Love&quot;. Awesome album cover!!<br />Recommend this album to ALL Scorpion fans, and would be a good sampler for the &quot;new&quot; fans.
B0000047GA|2.0|Personally I like the second Tony Williams Lifetime band better no disrespect to John Mclaughlin but Alan Holdsworth is just that more on edge and the songs seemed to have more purpose and direction. This recording as important as it may be in the birth/raising of fusion is very harsh and the grooves are too loose and heavier to the ear than metal (probably a bad comparison)but maybe that's the idear but I'm not as appreciative. Do not expect any Jimmy Smith, or Johnny 'Hammond' Smith comparisons to Larry Young on organ. Overall disappointing.
B00003CX9S|5.0|I have been waiting for many years for Paramount to release this film to video without cropping off the image. The entire film was shot in widescreen format (Freddie Francis is a master with B&amp;W). To truly enjoy and cherish this film it needs to be seen as close to it's original format as possible.<br />After seeing a screening of The Elephant Man at AMMI (American Museum of the Moving Image) a few years ago, I realized that the VHS shortchanges the viewer of so much.......But alas.... DVD may be the format that brings this film to the masses. <br />I hope Paramount is up to the challenge.  This is an amazing film that deserves to be showcased on the highest level because it will constantly remind us that we are human.
B00003CX6P|1.0|Had the full six-pack but lacked the plastic thingy to hold it all together.
B00004Z459|1.0|Around july or August 2000, I heard &quot;One Step Closer&quot; on the radio and instantly fell in love with it. In late November I got the Cd for my birthday and thought it was ok. Then in February, I found out that Linkin Park started out as a rap group (i don't like rap at all), which made me reconsider my thoughts about this band. Then I heard &quot;Crawling&quot; on the radio and fainted. That is by far the worst on the disc even though none of it is good. When I liked them, I thought it couldn't get much heavier than that. Now I have heard music that makes &quot;one step closer&quot; seem like a ballad. Over time, my tastes have gotten harder.
B000002N9L|2.0|After much public feuding with Warner Bros, he agreed to deliver them one more new studio album, and promptly knocked this out over a long weekend. While the production doesn't sound rushed, the tunes seem like he made them up on the spot: routine funk like &quot;Dig U Better Dead&quot; and &quot;I Rock, Therefore I Am&quot; is prolonged by boring guest rappers; &quot;Dinner With Delores&quot; recycles &quot;Money Don't Matter 2Night&quot;'s pop sound; &quot;Zannalee,&quot; the most enjoyable track on the CD, is just an uptempo blues. Lyrically too, it's all reruns. The silver lining is that, under pressure to create excitement quickly, he falls back on the exquisite lead guitar playing that he often displays in concert but has rarely recorded; the otherwise generic rocker &quot;I Like It There&quot; and ballad &quot;I Will&quot; benefit from this treatment. Michael Bland's drumming is also spotlighted more than on earlier releases. He's capable of so much better that you'd have to be a completist to want this.
B000000H3Z|5.0|This is my 2nd favorite album of all time. This is a must have for fans of thrash metal old school style. I would just recommend it to fans of metal in general. This is some of the best thrash metal I have ever heard. My favorites on here would have to be &quot;Beneath The Remains&quot;, &quot;Innere Self&quot;, and &quot;Stronger Than Hate&quot;. Recommended 120 %. There are NO fillers on here. If you are looking for bad music, this is the worst possible place to find it. If you like this, I would also recommend &quot;Schizophrenia&quot;, &quot;Arise, and &quot;Roots&quot; all by Sepul.
B00005J73X|4.0|I'm not a die-hard Bon Jovi fan, but I do like the band and their music.  Frankly, I really don't care how many discs there are to this album or where or when the songs were recorded.  I do care about the quality of the sound and the performance, however.   This is not the best live album I've ever heard, nor is it the worst either.  The sound is okay.  It seemed to improve toward the end of the album as the instrumentals tend to overpower Jon in some of the earlier tracks.  Overall, it left me a little flat and I'm not sure I can put into words exactly why.  At the same time I have to admit that I do like it, strangely enough.  It's nice having an updated greatest hits album that includes a few tracks from the Crush album.  I never liked &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; or &quot;Prayer '94&quot; from the Crossroad album, so I was glad they were omitted here. There are are some cover songs that Bon Jovi fans may or may not appreciate.  Surprisingly, I actually liked their version of Neil Young's &quot;Rockin' in the Free World.&quot;  &quot;I Don't Like Mondays.&quot; I Don't Like This Song Either!  No disrespect to Sir Bob, but this is a Bon Jovi concert!  Get off the stage!!  What bright spark decided that this would be a good track to include on the live album? In the final analysis, this IS Bon Jovi.  They rock, and you gotta admit, Richie Sambora plays a mean guitar!  So how wrong can you go getting this album, despite its flaws?

B00003TL18|5.0|I have only seen the PBS special 1 and a half times, but each time I was floored by the immense talent of everyone on that stage! This album is perfect! I'm serious! Ok, Elvis Costello appears to forget his solo part on one song, but it doesn't make all that much of a difference, it's still brilliant!  The songs are all so achingly beautiful, and being in love with someone you can only dream of is a common theme that will touch any heart that feels that way!  You've got everything from violins to electric guitars on here, and some of the most respected names in music too! The cd isn't quite as good as the PBS special (only because actually seeing it, not to mention the amazing cinematography really enhances the mood) but it is so worth it! If you have a really good stereo, the sound on this cd will blow you away! And even if you have a cheap sound system it will still be room-filling! This one is a family favorite for my dad, siblings and I. We have spent so many nights with this on the stereo, laughing, making dinner and catching up. This is excellent as background music, or to sit down and listen to in an empty room! It's amazing! The best songs (IMO) are &quot;Dream Baby&quot;(sizzling action with Bruce sharing the spotlight!) &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (the finale with the whole band coming together!) and &quot;Claudette&quot; (a fun, Springsteen style song that will stay in your head for a long time to come!) Though each song is amazing in it's own way! Now, know that I am a huge Springsteen fan, so I will admit to liking this partially because Bruce was so hot and handsome on this show (and in the liner pictures, where he actually upstages Roy O. by being in virtually every shot, and often the central subject! Not that I mind...!). But even the songs like &quot;It's Over&quot; and &quot;In Dreams&quot; that Bruce doesn't have the spotlight for are some of my favorites, so that can justify my liking this as a whole, not just for Bruce at his all-time hottest! Thebottom line, Bruce is Hot as can be (!) and EVERYONE on that cd is brilliant and gives it thier all. The result: A cd everyone should own! Amazing! I'm listening to it right now, and let me tell you, I never get tired of it! Amazing!
0226039331|5.0|If you are looking for Lexicon this one is probably the best you'll find on amazon. The Lexicon gives detailed meanings and interpretation of key greek words and some historical background.  It does fail to note when certain translations are recent and still controversial as other translations of Bauer's work do (User Beware).  This book is useful for anyone who is interested in getting deeper into what the Bible really means.  I would also recommend obtaining a book that teaches the basics of Biblical Greek.  This will allow you to unlock the full potential of a Lexicon.
0385501560|4.0|This is a great book.  Yet again, Chuck Palahniuk proves himself to be a very talented, insightful writer.  Having read all of his books, I think they just keep getting better as his career goes on, so this being the latest...Other notes: this one doesn't start at the end, like the others.  Some specific sentences in the book are very profound, and it is worth reading the whole book just for those (read it for the story too though, it's cool).  I would not reccomend this to someone that hasn't read his other works yet, if only because it is interesting to see his development as a writer from survivor to now this.  I suggest reading the books in order, I think you would appreciate it more.
B000002GI0|5.0|Just fantastic writing and performance!<br />I had never even heard of this guy before (let alone the stellar CD that proceeded this one) until one dark night driving a moving van from Montreal to Kingston, I caught an album release radio interview. It opened with &quot;Paper Thin&quot; and I could not believe how good it was, rivaling the Stones at their best in the 70's and eclipsing anything that Dylan ever crafted!<br />A must have CD. All the tracks are great and unlike anything else lurking around onthe radio waves.
0064407667|4.0|I just recently finished this book (as in yesterday), and I surprisingly enjoyed it. I wasn't actually looking forward to reading this book, I picked it up because of price rather than want. I finally got around to reading this book and I think it's great. <br />The story starts off with a day at the beach, one that was meant to be pleasant, and unfortunately was not. Due to unfortunate circumstances, the Baudelaire children, Violet (14), Klaus (12) , and Sunny (Infant) are sent to live with a distant relative that they have never met, Count Olaf. He turns out to be a filthy man, with a filthy plan, and well things get worse from there.<br />I find the plot to be very original, as well as most of the characters. I found it to be a quick and fun read.<br />This book does drag along a little but it does get better in the second book, The Reptile Room. I suggest after this book that you continue with the series, but then again its only a suggestion.<br />For this book you will see a lot of good reviews, and a lot of bad reviews. I think that some people are a bit too uptight, and over analyzing this book just a bit. <br />I also think that some don't understand the meaning of the words CHILDREN'S BOOK (I say this concerning the definitions throughout the book). I understand that a lot of adults and teenagers (I'm 14 myself) like to read children's books, but because it is a children's book, I don't understand getting upset over the definitions. I personally think it would be helpful to younger children reading this series, but everyone has their own opinion.<br />True, this is no Harry Potter, but I personally think that it is a good waiting book, that's why I'm reading the series.<br />As others have said, it is full of dark humor, and sarcasm, etc.,  Read at your own risk.. but I say, read it and have your own opinion.
6303921248|5.0|My family and I have watched this series four times. It is a delight.  I cannot compare it with earlier film versions of the book, but I can say that it is very faithful to the book. The actress who plays Elizabeth sparkles. Darcy is quite convincing--my daughter adores him.  I could have wished a more attractive actress for Jane--Jane after all is &quot;supposed&quot; to be prettier than Elizabeth--and I thought that the portrayal of Elizabeth's mother was a bit off the top.  But the actor who portraryed Elizabeth's father captured him perfectly.  Highly recommended.
6305171769|4.0|I must say, I was really expecting this movie to be really bad.  After six movies, what could they do with the storyline?  But, I really liked it!  The only reason that I didn't give &quot;Halloween H20&quot; five out of five stars was because I really missed the late, great actor Donald Pleasence (Dr. Sam Loomis.)
B00003CXRP|5.0|What a wondefull movie!!  It is an excellent depiction of the basic human needs ; Love, Companionship, Courage, and Loyalty. It was so wonderfull to finally see a movie with NO SEX! NO CRUDE HUMOR! NO VIOLENCE! LITTLE OR NO SWEARING! AND ONE THAT ACTUALLY MADE YOU LOVE LIFE ITSELF!  See, movies don't need all that vulgarity, violence, profanity and immorality to be a GREAT MOVIE!     If you're a movie goer who is critical of hollywood's immoral movies, and if you don't see and support movies like &quot;CAST AWAY&quot;, then you have no right to your critisism!!!     I loved the fact that the director showed the basic human need for companionship though Hank's friendship with the volleyball.  Some reviewers have said here they thought that that was stupid, or they thought it was funny when he lost the ball in the ocean.  Well,  lets see what they would do if it was they that were all alone for over 4 years with no one to talk to!!! I don't think that they would ever admitt the number of,&quot;inaniment or aninment (like animals)&quot; friends that they had made!!!!      One other key thing that no other reviewer here has pointed out to my knowledge is Loyalty.  The part in the movie I am speaking about is at near the end of the movie when Hanks's true love (PLAYED BY HELEN HUNT) remains loyal to her new husband and children.  HOW ADMIRABLE!!!      The last thing I loved about the show is when Tom Hanks explained that sometimes all that you can do to keep going in life when all the chips are down is to simply keep breathing, and take one day at a time.  THAT IS SO TRUE!! DON'T YOU THINK?      The only thing I would have added to the show if I were the director is that I would have instead of Hanks loving a volleyball that could not love him back, I would have had him draw closer to God, who can AND WOULD HAVE give him guidance, hope, and love beyond measure!       I love this show!           Dear Hollywood,  keep making movies like this.  These are the ones that willmake America's families strong, and individuals great, NOT WORSE!!!
6305171769|4.0|To be perfectly honest, I was expecting this movie to be very poor.  After six films, what other stoylines could the writers come up with?  But, I liked &quot;Halloween H20&quot; alot.  The only reason that I didn't give it five out of five stars was because of the absence of the late, great Donald Pleasence (Dr. Sam Loomis.)
0385335482|4.0|Becky Bloomwood is another Bridget Jones clone, except that Becky is addicted to shopping.  She can't pass a store without lusting after what's inside, and usually buying something. The banks and creditors are all after her, and she is tossing their evermore-impatient letters and avoiding their phone calls. You just want to alternately shake her for being so stupid and feel sorry for her because you can see a bit of yourself in her, if you are a woman who loooves to shop.  This book is a light, fun read and I enjoyed it.  I just thought the ending was too predictable--Becky wraps all her problems up tidily and gets the guy, besides.  Other than that, I recommend it for a weekend or beach trip read.
B000051VWW|4.0|In the early,and throughout the  80s,Sade and her band were so distinctive and owned the right to claim the development of the nightclubbing/lounge sound.She produced a debut CD that was brilliant and distinctive,that created *her* own style and sound.*Diamond Life* has remained a watershed for soulful adult groove.This CD caresses and tantilizes. After 5 or so years out of the spotlight Sade has returned with an excellent collection of seriously adult soulful and funky grooves.The sound is even more distinctive without changing her trademark formula.A definate maturity has made her songs even more appealing.This CD is so familiar to the existing fan of her style and music,and offers a welcome delight to the uninitiated. Andrew Hale,Stuart Matthewman and Paul Denman compliment her beautifully,so as to allow her voice to caress and sooth ,as a wave of sound washes over you. The singles *By Your Side* and *King of Sorrow* are excellent and worth the effort to listen,but the CD as a whole offers a rewarding experience.I think she has avoided the necessity to delve into hip hop,and techno wizzardry,and has remained self assured in her own original style.Listen to *Slave Song* and then to *the Sweetest Gift* and *Lovers Rock*,and see the diversity.No one,other than Bryan Ferry possibly,delivers with such sensual appeal,and has such an immediately recognizable sound.Very adult and worth several plays to appreciate the textures and layering.The use of the drum programming does not detract unnecessarily from the overall product. A very smooth delight to the senses,and well worth the money expended.A rating of 4 to 4.5,and if you listen to this after 10 pm with that special person 5 stars all the way.If you loved *The Sweetest Taboo* and *This is No Ordinary Love*..you will not be disappointed.A welcome addition to your collection..gentle on your mind,red wine in hand recommended.
B00005BL2A|4.0|&quot;Put on your blindfold and a dress that's tight And come with me on a mystery night&quot;. Thanks God for Dave Gahan's incredible voice because these lyrics have got to be their worst. Don't even get me started on the lyrics from &quot;The Dead of Night&quot;. Having said that, I still love this CD, albeit only half of the tracks (standout track for me is &quot;Freelove&quot;). I've been a DM fan since Day 1 and truly love their artistry. &quot;Violator&quot; will go down in history as a start-to-finish classic...&quot;Exciter&quot; is a bit of a departure, but a well produced and mixed recording nontheless. I love these guys and I forgive them for their lame lyrics. I think Dave Gahan could sing the Yellow Pages and I would buy it...and he's in top-form on this recording.
0393316041|5.0|Feynman never said &quot;I can't do that!&quot; and gave up on something that he was interested in.  This book shows how he didn't follow life's paths - he created new ones instead!  <br />This book is a gem!  It has taught me - through Feynman's eyes - that we should never give up on something that we truely want to do - just because we are conditioned to believe we only have one talent.  Feynman was a good enough theoretical physicist and won the Nobel Prize, yet he did graduate work in biology, spoke about the Mayans, played in a samba band, learned to draw and sell paintings, learned Portugese - just because he wanted to!<br />Feynman's spirit really shines through this book without making the reader feel stupid about physics.  Through Feynman's candidness about the world around him, he teaches all of us about living life to its fullest, and encourages us to try and do all that we can.  In the middle of it all is the love of the learning about life and the world - the world of physics!  <br />I found myself laughing many times and wondered how someone could have SO VERY MANY adventures that are all true.  But, part of this comes with Feynman's natural ability to tell the story of his life through this book, and the amazing strength of character that Feynman has.  I strongly encourage anyone who has ever had doubts about themselves to read this book, also anyone who just wants a good story about a VERY interesting person's life!
B000002P2V|3.0|WHO ARE YOU was the moment when Pete Townshend stalled out, and the rumble it sent through the Who proved, once and for all, who the driving force in the band really was.<br />Two of the albums best tracks--&quot;905&quot; and &quot;Trick Of The Light&quot;--came from Entwistle.  They are typically Entwistle, which is to say, they are totally atypical songs.  One a clone's lament, the other about a man who doubts the sincerity of a hooker.  Fun stuff.<br />&quot;Who Are You&quot; was the hit--I've never really understood why, the way it rambles all over the place--and &quot;Sister Disco&quot; was the fist-raiser on the subsequent US tour.  <br />But, as a writer and musician, I've always preferred &quot;Guitar &amp; Pen,&quot; the only song I've ever heard that accurately describes the the highs and lows of the creative process.  The second version added to the CD is even better, a much more in-yer-face mix.
B000056IKS|5.0|Yeah, it's been way too long but thank God it's finally happened. Mr. Rother &amp; Mr.Dinger have finally quit being stingey and given us what we've wanted for years, a proper remastering of their 3 great albums. You can definitely tell whose been nixing things off these guys over the past couple of decades(i.e. Bowie, Stereolab, Telstar Ponies,AmAnSet(j/k)etc.). Everything you've heard so far about this band is true so do not hesitate to pick this cd up along with the others. Now if only Kraftwerk would get of their digital derriere's and remaster their first 3 albums plus that ORGANIZATION thingy. Enjoy.
B00003CXMG|5.0|If you lived through any part of the sixties, you must see this movie.  Once you have seen it, you MUST OWN it!  It will bring back memories you didn't know you had.  All the performances are first rate.  Kate Hudson deserved her oscar nomination (she should have won!)  The movie is funny and touching and the music makes you want to dust off your old LPs (were you smart enough to keep them?) just to look at the covers again.  I searched all night for old songs; America by Simon and Garfunkle and Mona Lisa and Mad Hatters by Elton John.  What a charmer this film was.  Don't hesitate!
B0000047CW|5.0|I was given this album when it first came out and of all my music it's my favorite. Since then I've worn out three vinyls and now I have the CD, plus it goes everywhere with on my PDA! The best music is timeless, and this sounds as fresh and full of life as it did nearly 40 years ago. The genius of these two consummate musicians is synergistic, and for my money, this is Byrd at his very best.
B000001DZM|4.0|Okay, somewhere between good and great.  Good compilation fodder, but how many remixes of &quot;I Like the Nightlife&quot; do you really need? About 6 apparently.  Still, good background music for a party.  Pleased I bought it.
B00003CXDU|4.0|This movie is about a show which was aired in the beginning f the 80's, but was taken off the air due to low viewer ratings. Now the actors from the show travels from sci-fi convention to sci-fi convention. But one day real aliens need their help to save their world. They think the tv-show is an actually documentary of what they have done and not just entertainment for us earthlings. Whenever i watch STAR TREK TNG, i always get annoyed because the aliens talk oerfect english, and they act like human beings (but look a little bit different). Here we get an explanation on why the aliens look like humans, and they're language isn't even close to perfect. This is tip-top entertainment and i totally reccomend it! Not to Star Trek fans though, they'll be offended...
B0000021RD|5.0|Dear God, I am shocked.  Chicago II is the first album I've picked up outside of the Greatest Hits collections, and I can't believe what I'm hearing!  How could Chicago be one of the greatest PROGRESSIVE rock bands of all time and I didn't know about it?<br />I put this album on for the first time and didn't stop smiling over the course of its 23 songs.  The tunes on this album are so complex, so melodically rich, so creatively structured, and so full of soul and feeling that words can do them no justice.  How these songs were written, I can't even comprehend.  <br />This group had talent to burn.  Lots of it!  Lamm, Kath, and Cetera all are FABULOUS vocalists and they all have a good go on this one, trading off on lead vocal and backing each other up with some of the smoothest, sweetest, richest vocal harmonies you'll ever hear.  Then there's the horn section, with its gorgeous, bright arrangements.  Then there's Kath, with his fabulous and often understated work on lead guitar.  Then there's flute and piano leads and all kind of little wonders.<br />Despite being a tremendous fan of 70s music (I lived through the decade as a child), I never realized just how good Chicago really was--I had never explored their individual albums.  I'm so happy I did--one listen to Chicago II has shown me how wondrous this outfit really was.  The music on this album is so ahead of its time it boggles the mind.<br />I can literally, say, with no exaggeration (with The Beatles and other greats in mind), this is one of the BEST albums I've ever heard in my life.
B00005B36H|5.0|My brother is obsessed with this band, and considering he takes me places this CD is always on. I was real impressed that they hadn't sold out like most bands(Limp Bizkit.) The other thing I liked about this CD was that this is one of the only Tool Cd's that didn't downgrade God or Jesus. Now I don't get looked down at for listening to this CD (even though I don't care what other people think because Aenima rocked even though I disliked Euology, but I am sure some people would like to know that.) The 'Intermissions' are a nice add to the CD. I am not always into lyrics, althought Maynard has an awesome voice, so the long spaces of just musci was well accepted with me. I really recommened this CD to all people.
630575067X|3.0|this movie is a good set up movie for the sequels,  but not nearly as good as the first three films that came out.
B00003A9QL|5.0|The symphonic part of this album gives the old MetallicA hits, such as Puppetz and For Whom the Bell Tolls, a better sound. Cause it's not just the loud electric guitars, it's also the violins and other orchestra insturments. And the new songs, such as -Human and No Leaf Clover, are brilliant I can't wait to hear those new ones without the orchestra. But anyway, Micheal Kamen did a great job, not only hear but also on the first recording of Nothing Else Matters on the Black Album.
0553106635|5.0|In Martin's world who's to say who the \\"good guy\\" is. In his world no character is safe from harm, no character is sacred. In a world reminiscent of Glen Cook's excellently constructed \\"Black Company\\", people who live for ideals usually, as in real life, are destroyed by the greed and ambition of heartless boys in the bodies of men. Martin keeps you turning page after page eagerly seeking the next wholly unpredictable stage of each character's life. My only complaint is the frequent, and completely unnecessary, sex scenes.
1563894696|5.0|Being a Batman fan for many years and seeing all the transitions and interpretations of the character, this is one of the best stories I have read in a long time.  The noir style of the story, and the dark, shadowy, &quot;Frank Miller-esque&quot; art by Tim Sale is his best work ever!  This story picks up where &quot;Year One&quot; left off, and delivers.  Loeb and Sale are up there with the greats like Miller, Adams , and O'neil.  If you enjoyed &quot;Dark Knight&quot; or &quot;Year One&quot;, you will like this one. Definitely a great book for the older Batman fans!
B000001FI7|5.0|I'm not joking when I say this.  This album is back all the way from 1994-- but it sounds as fresh as something today.  This is the perfect &quot;Rainy Day&quot; album because it is so melancholy and at times haunting.  Beth Gibbon's (the lead singer) voice is haunting alone.  It is so beautiful, and thats one of the things that make the band great.  Full of funky trip hop beats, Beth's voice, and more, this album is destined to become a modern classic.  This is THE essential electronic album.  Hardly anything can come close to this.  It's so different from anything you have ever heard.  Take my word for it and check this album out.<br />if this was helpful, click the icon below. thanks!
0671027344|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have read in my life. It makes you feel infinite. Charlie describes what his life is all about and how he gets through the hard times. It really makes you look at your life and see how you would rate it, it also makes you want to enjoy every minute in life that you have.
006092988X|5.0|A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a classic.  It's a story about a strong, brave, loving, girl growing up in the rough city of Brookly.  If you're looking for a book to read, or even a summer reading book, this is a definite choice.  Everyone you has read this book has liked it.  The author wrote this book in a way that you can understand everything clearly.  This is one book you must read!
B00003CXQY|5.0|Disney is known for movies with strong morals, a seemingly impossible pair that fall in love, and its festive musical numbers. &quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot; totally breaks free of the squeaky clean Disney's image and can only be described one way: &quot;Cutting edge&quot;. David Spade does a spectacular job of playing the snobby and spoiled Emperor. His endearing sidekick is the true hero of the story. There is no enticing female role that the main character desires, in fact, this movie seems to totally drop traditional Disney gender roles. The woman is the bad guy, she has a dumb male right hand man, and not all of the men are ONE thing, either are the women. It was a wonderful new innovative movie for Disney, and I think it will open up a lot of doors. I knew from the moment the Emperor yelled &quot;BOO-YAH!&quot; that this was not what I had expected.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is the best album in a long time.  I'm glad to see it sold the most cd's it first week of release and held on to second in the second week.  Tool and Radiohead have true talent and hopefully the pop era will decline in strength.  If you don't have this album then get it.  Download a song such as lateralis or reflection and that will be proof enough.  The whole album is an artwork.  buy it now.
B00005ABKC|5.0|This is the best of Tom's albums.  It picks up exactly where \\"Damn the Torpedos\\" left off.  I'm not going to go through it song by song, because there are no weak points.  Tom is great, then and now!!!  If you are a Heartbreaker fan, then this is your album!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Finally made it into Westwood to see Moulin Rouge -- I was bound and determined to see it before it opened wide, and I'm glad I did.  The house was half full, kind of incredible when you realize it was a decent sized cinema in the middle of the afternoon on a Thursday, in a hard-to-get-to place the day before the movie opens everywhere.<br />I can't remember the last time a movie made me laugh out loud, break into spontaneous applause (more than once), and hold my breath at the end.  It's hilarious, tragic, pure fun, over-the-top silly and surprisingly touching.  I'll never think of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; the same way ever again.  After hearing Ewan McGregor belt it out (he goes through more musical styles in two hours than most people do in a lifetime, and does them well) Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot; will never be the same either, but for vastly different reasons.  &quot;Come What May,&quot; the only original song in the film, is still playing in my head.  I think I'm a little dizzy, and that was after an hour-long drive home when I didn't play my radio because I didn't want to interrupt the songs echoing in my mind.<br />The film is gorgeous.  I'm not sure if I was intoxicated or assaulted, and I *am* sure that's intentional.  The writing is weak, but that's to be expected -- the script isn't the thing here, the emotions are, and those are broad and naked and rapturous.<br />The cast worked together beautifully, and put blood into it.  Rarely have I seen an ensemble throw themselves into their work as wholehearted as this one (if ever).  Nicole Kidman as Satine was described by a critic as 'game' in this, and I can see why -- she does a strong job, but she's miscast.  Happily, the film isn't actually about Satine, any more than La Traviata is about Violeta.  This is Christian's story, and Ewan McGregor is more than capable of carrying the film, because he's the heart of it.  And if this film is about anything, it's about heart.<br />Each of the supportingcharacters is good, particularly the Duke and Ziegler.  The whole feeling is operatic, with high camp and severe pain interspersed, sometimes so closely together I got emotional whiplash.  Which is exactly how I was supposed to feel.<br />I identified with Christian completely, from his initial confusion to his bursts of genius, through his discovery of love to his bitter feeling of betrayal, all the way until his heart led him back where he needed to be.  Even the colors of the film follow the pattern of Christian's experience -- the world is bright and chaotic and huge at the beginning, and as he experiences life and love and pain it gradually closes in to two buildings as the world is leeched of color.  The editing approached frenetic, but it worked by and large, especially during the Roxanne Tango (one of the two places that had me holding my breath).<br />Kidman and McGregor both have excellent comedic timing, and McGregor also has a way of pulling the stops out and breaking your heart when you least expect it.  I can well understand why he's gotten good reviews even from reviewers who didn't like the film.  The music is surprising and fun and weirdly perfect for the story:  I say weirdly because I'm not sure Baz intended to get some of the reactions he got, but it worked.  This is one of those rare movies that will hit every culture that sees it in a different place, and if the audience is willing to suspend cynicism long enough to care about the heart being bared for them, then it will work everywhere it plays.<br />This film worked for me because it does what opera used to do (and still can when it doesn't get too grand for its britches).  It takes a love story, makes it the center of the world, surrounds it with music, and drenches you in the experience.<br />The audience in Westwood was a microcosm of what I expect the broad audience to be.  Women in clumps (it's a chick flick), couples (it's a date flick), gays (in couples and in clumps -- it's definitely going to be a hit with the unabashedly artsy among us).  I have a feeling the film's going to play relatively well in the US, and really well overseas, where they're not as embarrassed to be thoroughly entertained as we seem to be here.<br />The overall impression I carried away from the film was hopeful and sad and brilliant at the same time.  I smiled all the way home, and given how the last scene at the Moulin Rouge (not in the film, but on-stage at the club) ends, that's saying something about the power of the two hours that preceeded it.<br />I'm going to go see it again tomorrow (and I seldom see movies twice in the cinema).  I can't recommend it highly enough.  Leave your ennui at the door and prepared to be swept off your feet.
B00003CX97|5.0|I just read Geoff Puterbaugh's review and I must say; The man was obviosly taking part in other activities (possibly involving psychotropic substances)while watching this film (I hope for his sake he was, otherwise he has no excuse for such an opinion, unless of course he happens to be retarded).  I am not going to go into detail about this film.  There are better writers with similar opinions to mine who have written splended reviews.  But this movie is an all time great.  Giving it an OK review I would disagree with, but respect.  Giving this film a bad review, and backing it up with an idiotic explanation forced me to write my one and only review.  Alec Guiness states clearly that he is standing up for his principals not because he is lazy and does not want to do work, or because he finds himself above manual labor, but because you have to draw the line somewhere.  He knows that if you give an inch to your enemy he will take a mile.  That, I feel is his point.
B00005J73X|5.0|Almost two decades ago this band set out to be one of the bigget bands in the world. They played everywhere lived nowhere they often joked. It is apparent that their hard work has paid off once again.   Today they are one of the biggest rock bands in the world. And why you may ask? Because they put on the best live shows ever! They are seasoned professionals who will keep you rocking and sweating the whole night.     One Wild night Live captures all exitement, all the talent of this awesome band. A true treat for the diehards and a must for the  new fans too young to remember Slippery, New jersey and Keep the faith days. This record rocks. Now go buy it
0767832248|5.0|I've seen many films similar to &quot;Awakenings&quot;. Underdog doctor discovers special patients, learns to communicate with and help them, fights evil system, triumphs, declared hero. Yet I have found no film of that nature to rival &quot;Awakenings&quot;, and not only because the good doctor's triumph doesn't last. The beauty of &quot;Awakenings&quot; is that it never becomes precious or schmaltzy; it succeeds, as films rarely do, in truly getting behind the eyes of the characters, in asking questions about life and humanity without being pretentious. &quot;Awakenings&quot; is real, it is beautiful. It documents the human spirit and gives the viewer much more than eye candy or Saturday night entertainment. Credit is due to Robert de Niro and Robin Williams, who turn in astounding performances, as well as to director Penny Marshall and screenwriter Steven Zaillian. Julie Kavner (&quot;The Simpsons&quot;) and Penelope Ann Miller also contribute sympathetic performances. A multi-Oscar nominee, &quot;Awakenings&quot; is one of the best films of the '90s.
B000001Y2U|3.0|You have to keep an open mind in listening to a Marilyn Manson record. That is, if you're not one of the dedicated Mansonites who routinely dye their hair black and make trips to the mall all that much scarier. But I digress...<br />As someone who primarily enjoys hip-hop and other black music, Marilyn Manson is a bit of a stretch. He's very white and very angry. But as I forked over my $ (...), I kept thinking, \\"Keep an open mind.\\" And as I popped it in the car for the ride home, I prepared myself for the worst: an all-out non-musical assault, with more distortion than a fun-house mirror. But no. What I got was a crowd chanting (I think) \\"We hate love... we love hate...\\" I was a little worried, but I pressed on.<br />The opener, \\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem,\\" is a pretty good song. It's got a hard-rocking riff, an up-tempo beat, and lyrics that, while they do aim to shock, are meant to be pondered as well. Manson always lays out grand plans for all his albums, each one  a concept and part of a bigger picture. But unless you're one of the above-mentioned hardcore fans, you'll never get the full message. <br />What I focused on is the talent within the music and vocals. It's pretty ample, I must say. \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" was produced by Manson and Trent Reznor, and they give the music a muddy-synthetic, paranoid quality that matches Manson's shifting volume, going from a deathly quiet murmur to a metal-grating scream in mere seconds.<br />As I saw it, the whole album was about a metamorphosis of sorts, from worm to butterfly. Songs like \\"Cryptorchid,\\" with references to worms, boys, and rape, and titles like \\"Kinderfeld\\" and \\"Man That You Fear\\" (whose tag is \\"the boy you love's become the man that you fear\\") all point to a major statement about coming into your own. Manson just does it with spooky synthesizers, distorted metal riffs and crashing drums.<br />There's a certain creepiness to this album that makes it different from the normal electro-metal record. Marilyn Manson, despite his mission to shock America and indeed the world, is a clever guy, and his lyrics prove it. He's not just screaming \\"Kill your mom, eat your children, have sex with corpses.\\" And if he DOES do it, it's to make you think. <br />This is an interesting record, but like I said, you have to keep an open mind. If for no other reason, pick it up to prove to yourself that he's not the devil.
B000056VIY|5.0|I LOVE Jennifer Lopez!!!!This album is great!!!But I think her old album has a better sound!My fave songs are &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; and &quot;Play&quot;!!!!!I hope J.Lo's next single would be &quot;I'm Real&quot;!!!!
0060392886|5.0|The Dirt is an awesome tale of sex drugs and rock and roll dude. If you thought they told it all on vh1's behind the music. You are wrong.      Nikki Tommy Vince Mick and even John leave nothing to the imagination. They tell you everything about their rock and roll lifestyle  and make no apologies. (well okay maybe a few apologies)But in this era  of sugary sweet pop bands it's refreshing to see a true rock band tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. It's a great summer read. Hurry up buy this book i promise you won't be sorry
6304056958|5.0|I came across &quot;The Women&quot; on Turner Classic Movies one rainy afternoon and found it to be such a delight, I purchased it without having seen the first half. A showcase of some of the great female actresses of the '30s and '40s (Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, and Norma Shearer-though she has a tendency to overact), &quot;The Women&quot; is great good fun, a well-written, stylishly-directed comedy with some classic scenes sure to bring a smile to any classic movie fan's face.
B000003B6J|1.0|This piece of ignorant trash single-handedly ruined rap music, misled a generation, and destroyed the hip hop culture. These five fakers exploited the pathology of ghetto culture that NONE of them really lived in, and brainwashed many impressionalbe young people (many whom I've mentored at my job) who had no one else in their homes or hoods to teach them any better,into thinking that gang life, violence, and disrespecting women were cool! Thanks, NWA, for making a bad situation worse while laughing all the way to the bank! May hell be your next spot and may your CD's be used for skeet shooting!
B00004SCX6|5.0|My friend Amanda has this Oops! I Did it again CD and she let me listen to it when she came over to my house and its great. Britney Spears has such a pretty voice. now im thinking of getting this CD! And i think i will get it. But theres only one thing, I like Britney's music but i dont like her. But anyways get this CD if your a britney fan or if you just like her music. Because i know one thing im going to get it soon. I will write another review once i get the Britney Spears Oops!... I Did It Again CD.
B000003CUJ|5.0|Being such a mammoth work, Wagner's Ring isn't something a person can easily jump into, enjoy, and fully understand.  To this day, I still feel like a beginner to the work.  However, there are a few things that can help a person get somewhat of a grasp on the wonderful music contained therein.  This compilation is one of those crucial elements to understanding Wagner's Ring, because the music is where all the action is in the opera.  The words are only part of the story.  The music on this CD acquaints the listener with the gorgeous melodies and orchestral details in the Ring.  Lorin Maazel has created a great synthesis of the four operas that make up this work.  The sound is incredible (regardless of what other reviewers might have said, I find the sound to be incredible--detailed &amp; vivid).  The performance is excellent as well, which has become the standard of the Berliner Philharmoniker.  If you're looking for a great overview of the Ring or are just looking for some wonderful music, give this a try.  It's a sure pleaser as long as you're not anti-Wagner.
B00003OSTK|4.0|When I first rented this movie I had no way of being prepared for what I was about to see. I assumed like most films of this era that it was going to be some sort of cute romantic movie, that probably never deserved to win the \\"Best Picture\\" Oscar. I was completely shocked as I watched this film to see the themes that unfolded; the meaning of life, love, lust, and death! Based on the play \\"Menschen im Hotel\\" by Vicki Baum and the American play by William A. Drake, \\"Grand Hotel\\" catches our attention right from the very beginning. The film, for those who don't know, and I'm sure there are many who don't, is about the \\"Grand Hotel\\", and what exactly goes on in a place we are told nothing ever happens. If they only knew!! Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) is going to die very soon, so he decides to take out his life savings, and enjoy the last days of his life. This very same idea was later used in Kurosawa's \\"Ikiru\\". The one thing Kringelein HAS to do is stay at the \\"Grand Hotel\\". And, he wants the best room they have! Then there's Baron Felix Von Geigern (John Barrymore), who has run out of his luck, and now is broke, he finds himself in debt, and will do ANYTHING to get out of it. Wallace Beery (Preysing) is a business man who finds himself also in a load of trouble, his company won't be able to close a deal that might cost his job. Grusinskaya (The ALWAYS amazing Greta Garbo!! One of my all time favorite actresses)is a dancer who just doesn't want to dancer anymore, she feels that the audience no longer enjoys her performances. And, finally rounding out everything, there's Joan Crawford (Flaemmchen) who works for Preysing (Beery), and has fallen under the charms of Geigern (J.Barrymore). Edmund Goulding's directing is very good. He's able to display each story in a way that makes it fresh. He doesn't take the same appoarch to every scene. Which really impressed me. Most directors, even today, could and might of [goofed] up the whole movie by not knowing how to \\"treat\\" it. I'm not going to discusse every little detail about this movie, that would take me far too long, but, I will make a few more comments. The ending is a shocker! I did not see it coming, I assumed it would of ended happily, in a way I'm glad it didn't. For a movie made in 1932 I think this was a bit ahead of it's time. I hope many many others rent or buy this film. It's a wonderful movie that has some of the best actors\actresses of that era (Garbo, L. Barrymore, and J. Crawford). Truly deserving of it's Oscar.eat\\" it. I'm not going to discusse every little detail about this movie, that would take me far too long, but, I will make a few more comments.

B0000024K1|5.0|I recall hearing &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; while driving down a highway in 1988. I pulled over my car and said, &quot;Well, rap's gonna go downhill after this, it can't get any better!&quot; So far I've been right. This was perhaps the first rap concept album. Instead of being simply a collection of songs, it's connected by Malcolm X and Farrakhan speeches and oher skits. By the way, the siren heard so often on this CD (and the source of many complaints) is from Maceo Parker's sax solo from an early 70s song by the JB's called &quot;The Grunt.&quot; This was rap at its peak before being ruined by the likes of NWA.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|A completely astonishing film, both visually and emotionally.  The amazing chemistry between Nicole and Ewen only make this wonderful love story more special.  The musical numbers are great, the acting is great, the cinematography is great, constumes...I could go on and on!  Do not delay, watch Moulin Rouge Today!
B00005J6UP|5.0|This is a childhood favorite and it is currently still one of my favorites.  I can watch this over and over again w/out getting tired.  It's a classic story about a bunch of friends going on an adventure.  What kid wouldn't love a movie like this?  I'm glad it's coming out on DVD, another cherished movie to add to my DVD collection.
0446310786|5.0|I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at this book.  I suppose I read it years ago, in high school, but I don't recall it.  My son has to read this book this summer, and I ordered it for him here.  I was bored one afternoon and asked him if I could borrow his book so that I could check out what his summer reading assignment would be.  Well, I sat on the porch most of the day reading and had a hard time putting the book down.  It's wonderful for all ages....it has lessons that all of us can benefit from.  Scout is a wonderful character, I can see why so many people name their children (Demi Moore) and their pets (my dentist) after her!<br />I recommend this book for anyone who is hesitant...who may have read it years ago and doesn't remember it well, or who didn't enjoy it then.  You will appreciate it now.  To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful book.
6305313687|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, i was awe-struck. The acting, the cinamentography, and the story(the way it was presented with the black and white past and the color present) was so provocative, fantatic, sensational. It is most deffinatly one of my top three movies...
B000002LKF|5.0|After exploring African sounds on his wildly successful Graceland album, Paul Simon travels to another continent for new beats to explore.  Rhythm Of The Saints takes on the sounds of south American, more specifically, Brazil. Just as he did on Graceland, he manages to incorporate these sounds into his own and sound completely authentic.  The first song on the album &quot;The Obvious Child&quot; is a brilliant creation.  With its manic drumbeats and carnival like sounds, the song marches out of your speakers with a syncopatic precision.  &quot;The Coast&quot; is a great song about life on the road and &quot;Proof&quot; is a bouncy song.  &quot;The Cool, Cool River&quot; is a beautiful, airy song while the title track pounds along.  The Rhythm Of The Saints continues Paul Simon's long standing tradition of incorporating unusual rhythms into his own folksy sound.
B000002NIW|5.0|Wow. I remember when I first heard this record. It was the first Deftones record I heard all the way through, and I knew instantly that they were going to become one of my favorite bands. I love every song. Since every song is different I'll give a breakdown of each song for you possible buyers. // My Own Summer (Shove It): One of the 'Tones most well known songs. Chino whispers over the background music in this song except when the bone-crunching chorus of &quot;come/shove/the sun/aside&quot; along with &quot;shove it&quot; mixed in. One of the best lyrics I have heard are in this song...&quot;in my own summer the shade is a tool&quot; How can anybody not like that? // Lhabia: It starts out with Chino singing and then all of a sudden he morphs his voice into a creepy talking-whisper. For some reason reminds me of &quot;My Own Summer&quot; and &quot;Rickets&quot; // Mascara: A song about Chino's wife. At first it just Stef playing the guitar along with Chino's whisper-singing, and then moves into the more up-beat chorus of &quot;cause there's something about her long shady eyes...&quot; One of the best songs on the album. // Around The Fur: Opens with Abe's drums, then explodes in your ears after you have been calmed with Mascara...A screaming chorus with a break in the middle of the song then explodes again only to lead you into Rickets. // Rickets: Another song with a lot of whispering. The chorus explodes with &quot;you're probably right, but this time i don't want to listen&quot;. Great lead into one of the best songs of all time. // Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away): Wow. A totally awesome song. One of the best songs I have EVER heard, if not THE best. Very soothing vocals and background music. Just like &quot;My Own Summer&quot;, it has some of the best lyrics that I have ever come across. I can't begin to describe this AWESOME song. Just go out and buy Around The Fur! This song is a true classic! Wow. // Lotion: Chino, Stef, Chi, Abe and Frank show their heavierside with this Deftones classic. An angry song. &quot;I feel sick right here.&quot; Turn it up and get your frustrastions out. // Dai The Flu: Break in between storms (Lotion and Headup). Another 'Tones classic. Chino's voice floats high on the chorus &quot;now i know that you love me&quot;. // Headup: Yet another classic Deftones song. Features Max Calavera from Sepultura/Soulfly. Song about the death of Dana Wells, whom the album is dedicated to. Fast paced heavy song...R.I.P. Dana // Mx: Besides Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away), the best song on the record. Features Abe's wife Annalynn on backup vocals in the chorus. She adds a nice touch to the song. The whole band puts their all into this one. Everything about the song is cool...possibly the best Deftones song after Be Quiet...Chino sings well on this one, and the chorus makes the song. // Damone (Hidden Track): One of the best songs on the record. You have to skip through many minutes of slience after the end of Mx to get the this one. Somethime in the middle though, you get a funny little surprise at around 19:00. But anyway, the song is very good. A great ender to THE best metal CD ever. So please...go out and buy Around The Fur. It's worth all the money you spend!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|So far, this is by far the best movie this year!
B000003BDJ|4.0|This is a good sampler of Stones hits, but why did they not include The Last Time, which was one of the Stones' earliest big hits? You'll have to pick up High Tide and Green Grass in order to find The Last Time, so this isn't quite the definitive Stones compilation. It also completely ignores the Satanic Majesties album. It does have other essentials though, such as Jumping Jack Flash and Honky Tonk Women and the excellent live version of Midnight Rambler (as opposed to the lesser studio track from Let It Bleed). I would recommend getting High Tide and Green Grass and Through The Past Darkly instead of this, for a more complete and thorough overview of the Rolling Stones' early career.
0385501560|5.0|I read a lot of books from all genres. Fiction, non-fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, etc. etc. etc. This book is the best so far. As you're reading it, you feel your mind being turned inside out: you become aware of the things that were there all your life, yet you never counsciously thought of. Amazing explanations of human nature coupled with humor just gets you to say &quot;damn&quot; outloud on almost every page. I would recommend anyone to get this book.

B000002WYT|5.0|If you do not like &quot;Crash,&quot; you have either simply not listened to the album, or you have no mind for real music. &quot;Crash&quot; is a classic if there ever was one, and if you are a fan of jazz, alternative rock, or even a little folk, than this is for you. If not, get it anyway, you will still end up loving it! I will explore each song below:<br />So Much To Say: Good album opener, and a good, up-beat tune to kick of a festival of great music.<br />Two Step: Dave says this is his favorite tune to play live, and that is understandable. This song is amazing, and though it may take a couple of listens to break you in, it is special.<br />Crash Into Me: No second-listens necessary, you'll love this upon the first strum of the guitar. This is a softer, but nearly perfect song. Actually, you've probably heard this before, whether you know it or not.<br />Too Much: Speaking of having heard things before, this hit it big on the radio, and understandably, as it is even better on the album. Another up-beat song, to change the mood from &quot;Crash Into Me.&quot; Another great song.<br />#41: Probably my favorite song on the album. The vocals are like none other, the lyrics are new and different (but, again, special), and the jam session that is this song is magnificent.<br />Say Goodbye: My 2nd-favorite on the album, as #41 fades into this with passionate bongo drums, and when the beat picks up, it stays passionate, with love ballad-like lyrics. Great song, I love it.<br />Drive in, Drive Out: Not my favorite by any means, but it is still at very least worth a listen.<br />Let You Down: I didn't like this at first, but it grew on me and I now truly appreciate it as a piece of music.<br />Lie In Our Graves: The opening instrumental here kicks off an awesome song, another Matthews classic.<br />Cry Freedom: Soft, but meaningful song. A Must-listen, it says a lot and is really a nice listen.<br />Tripping Billies: Great song, shades of &quot;Ants Marching.&quot; Itis very upbeat, and has soaring instrumentals and fun lyrics. You must here this to believe it!<br />Proudest Monkey: Well, I like this, call it a guilty pleasure I guess, because it really isn't one of DMB's best, but oh well, it is enjoyable to me nonetheless.<br />Well, that's it. I hope that helps you make your decision on &quot;buy vs. do not buy.&quot; However, I STRONGLY suggest you purchase this if you haven't already, because you will love it, even if not at the first listen, you will eventually, and I would bet the farm on that, folks.
B00001U0DP|2.0|For the film critic from Canada, I find it interesting that you posted a review saying you loved this movie yet you discouraged someone with a different opinion from posting his review. What, is everyone's opinion supposed to be the same as yours? How boring! I agree that Roberto was begging for laughs, and begging to be loved. The whole first half of this movie was bizarre slapstick. Then it segued into a serious drama that to me was incredibly unconvincing. One can argue that this is a fantasy, but I believe the Holocaust deserves a more accurate portrait. The concentration camp reminded me of something built on a Hollywood backlot. I did find the ending to be surprising and effective, but what came before was merely average. For real humor (though dark), and an intense depiction of the horrors of the Holocaust, I would recommend Schindler's List. Life is Beautiful was just too cloying and scattered.
B00005BJPO|3.0|I caught the remastered version of Akira on a digital projector in Burbank a few weeks back.  I am a huge fan of the original release of Akira.  It is by far one of, if not the most amazing works of animation ever created.  Five stars.  I caught it on the big screen back in the early 90's and it forever changed my visual perception.<br />I must say that the newly recorded dialogue and script is, by and large, a waste of effort.  The new print is beautiful, colors are glowing, as saturated as they have ever been.  I also noticed myself gazing at some new details in the shadows that were brought out by the new print.  Although the new hi-fi sounds ie. explosions and glass shattering are impressive, I found my stomach turning at how the lines were butchered by voice actors who didn't seem to characterize the various players in the story very well.  The voices of Kaneda and Tetsuo, who would seem most important, are just not there.  Kaneda's voice is not authorative or interesting enough, and Tetsuo's voice is lacking in intensity.  The Colonel's voice is nowhere near the original actor's entertaining delivery.  Down the line, all the actors just fail to capture the original spirit.  They chose to go with younger actors to play the three numbered experiments, not just for Takashi.  This was an interesting choice, but again, they lack &quot;screen presence&quot; in an audio sense.  If you have seen the original, you might find it slightly irritating that they pronounce &quot;Kaneda&quot; with a soft &quot;Kah-nehda&quot;, which is proper Japanese pronunciation, but the original pronunciation just sounds cooler phonetically anyways.  Oh well.<br />As a writer, I have plenty to deride about the reworking of the script.  It adds very little in the way of story.  The entire rewrite is essentially Akira: the Thesaurus Script.  Replace every combination of words with another set of gramatically correct, but unusual responses in a situation where the original dialogue would've fit.  The cliche that applies in this case is if ain't broke, don't fix it.  I really hope they include the original English dialogue, but somehow, as easily they could, I doubt they will.e fit.  The cliche that applies in this case is if ain't broke, don't fix it.  I really hope they include the original English dialogue, but somehow, as easily they could, I doubt they will.
B000002U82|5.0|Good luck trying to find something better. The most mesmerizing music I've ever heard, enough to make your imagination roam free. It WILL open your eyes and make you think differently, take you into another universe. Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to be heavily &quot;medicated&quot; to enjoy Dark Side. I recommend taking it on a long road trip, far away from wherever you live. Bring it to another environment and listen to it over and over and over and over.... It will change your life. <br />I'm just disappointed VH1 didn't put it in the top 10 of its greatest rock albums. Number 50 seems almost like an insult. Disagree?
B0000026UL|5.0|Of course, 'Blood on the Tracks' is supposed to be any discerning 'Dylanologist's'  favourite album, but I beg to differ. I don't think there's another Dylan record that conjures up such a dense, stark, bewildering atmosphere as this one. Daniel Lanois' production is excellent because it most subtly focuses on acoustic instruments such as the dobro and the lap steel but it alone cannot account for the real impact of this record, which does not contain a single weak song. 'Long Black Coat', 'Ring them Bells', 'What was it...' - all of these songs manage to evoke a strange, perhaps even menacing atmosphere.  A good example to illustrate the fact that rock music is NOT only about cruising, parties, sex, fun. Quite definitely not a summer record but a perfect album for long autumn nights and  - to me - Bob's Best.
B00005K9LN|5.0|The running order of the tracks on the remastered CD (excluding the two bonus tracks of course) is the same as it was on the original vinyl release when the album first came out in 1980.  According to Judas Priest's own web site, when British Steel was initially released on CD the record company changed the order for some reason unknown to the band.  While it seems odd to hear on the first few listens I'm glad that the order of the tracks was restored to what the band had originally intended.
B00000IPAX|5.0|yo! this was an awsome cd.  every track on here was pretty phat.  the best ones though were aliens dont exist, going away to college, whats my age again, adams song, all the small things, and best of all mutt. get this cd, its off the hook!
B000002HRE|4.0|First off, anyone who bashes this album based on past Metallica releases is missing the point.  We're not in 1983 anymore.  At least in their albums, Metallica have made their stamp on thrash metal and have moved on.  They still play all the old stuff live, and play it better than ever.<br />Anyway, let's get straight to the point here.  If you are a hardcore metalhead, and accept nothing but fast and angry music, this album is obviously not for you.  If you are just a fan of good hard rock of all kinds from blues to metal, chances are you'll enjoy this.  As far as Lars' drumming here, it is simpler than before.  Mainly because these Load records are more guitar driven (both Kirk and James play rhythum) than before, and Lars is simply becoming more vibe oriented, rather than being all flashy and show-off.  Still, as seen on the songs &quot;Fuel&quot; and &quot;Bad Seed&quot;, there are still some good drum fills throughout the album.<br />Even though its been done 100 times before, I feel its necessary to break this down song by song.  I'm even going to listen to them as I write this.<br />1) Fuel:  Fast song, as the title indicates.  Almost reminicent of old Motorhead, particularly &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;.  The fast and simple main rhythum, the guitar fills in between, and Lars' churning double-bass drum during the chours.  The best song on the album.<br />2) The Memory Remains:  An old friend of the 'Stones, Marianne Faithful, contributes some vocals here.  Again, simple guitar riffs, almost like a darker Iron Maiden.  The subject matter deals with famous people fading out of the spotlight.  You'll notice here that Kirk's leads are more blues than speed, something he learned from one of his guitar heros:  UFO's Michael Schenker.  Another great song.<br />3) Devil's Dance:  Funny how the old Metallica never wrote anything about the devil.  This is where the heavyness begins.  The opening guitar effects are great (especially the crunchy one at about :16).  Although it doesn't have the groove of the classic &quot;Sad but True&quot;, it holds its own.  Basically, this song is about the temptations of the devil.  A real hidden gem.<br />4) The Unforgiven II:  Indeed, it does resemble the original song in some ways.  James was writing this song one day and realized that the chord progression was similar to &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;.  Rather than toss it, he tweaked it up enough so that it only became a sequel.  The somewhat &quot;country&quot; sound in the clean guitar is just James using the B-bender in his Fender Telecaster.  Its interesting how in the original, the verses had heavy music and the chorus had soft, while here its vice versa.  Overall, despite the resemblance to the first Unforgiven, this song is good enough to stand on its own.<br />5) Better than You:  A song that wins a Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance can't be that bad.  The subject matter deals with something we all can relate to:  the desire to be better than your rivals.  Hard, driving guitars are the heart of this song.<br />6) Sliter:  Although not a terrible song, its not one of the most memorable.  James seems to be telling us something when he says &quot;There ain't no heros here&quot;.  One thing about all of Metallica's songs is that they are open to a lot of interpretation.  This one doesn't seem to have a meaning that's obvious.<br />7) Carpe Diem Baby:  The title pretty much says what this song is all about.  Great sense of movement here.  If you don't like this, James has two words for you:  &quot;Suck it!&quot;<br />8) Bad Seed:  Tuning down to C# gives this song an added element of heavyness.  Lars gets a little wild on the drums here, especially in the chours.  Cool song.<br />9) Where the Wild Things Are:  You may know a children's story book by the same name.  Haunting opening guitars lead to pounding power chords.  Indeed, the whole song is very dark and haunting, reminicent of Alice in Chains.  Another cool song.<br />10) Prince Charming:  A fun, loose, and dirty song, kinda like &quot;So What&quot;.  Not too much lyrical or musical depth here, just something to sit back and enjoy.<br />11) Low Man's Lyric:  This song about the homeless seems out of place on a Metallica record.  Even though a past song, Nothing else Matters, has the same slow and clean feel to it, it doesn't have the climactic ending of its predecessor.  Many people would avoid this song simply because its a pure ballad, but again, that's missing the point.  Nevertheless, a cool song.<br />12) Attitude:  The theme of vibe oriented songs continues here.  Aggressive in its music and lyrics, its another great song.<br />13) Fixxxer:  Here's where it gets ugly (in a GOOD way).  The opening wahs of the guitar are Hendrix-like in their sound.  This is one twisted, heavy song, somewhat similar to &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot;.  One of the best on the album, and one of the more popular songs among the fans.<br />This album, along with Load, is a lot more loose than the tightness and speed of '80s Metallica.  Still, most modern bands (3 Doors Down, Papa Roach, Blink 182) would crumble under the weight of this album.  It might be a weaker Metallica album than others, but its definately not a bad one.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I bought this cd just for the &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; remake, after actually listening to the entire CD I found out a few things. Firstly, Nicole Kidman can actually sing. Secondly, it is a upbeat mix of slow and fast pounding songs. Lastly, with the images I have seen in all the preview ads and specials, I find myself awaiting the Opening of this movie tomorrow. The visuals I have seen, combined with the Soundtrack, should prove to be a feast for the eyes and ears for the serious movie-goer.
B0000508U6|5.0|I don't want to say too much about this album because you really have to hear it for yourself to understand, but it was...... awesome; an absolute piece of work. You'll get a real rush from listening to this cd, and you'll feel really good after listening to it. Just a little note: my favourite song is Don't Panic, because 'we live in a beautiful world, yea we do, yea we do'. <br />Buy it, you'll love it!!!
B000056K04|3.0|Long time fans of Dave will be disappointed with his newest album, but new listeners might enjoy his effort at sounding more &quot;radio friendly,&quot; as I like to call it.<br />Dave's most recent compilation introduces a new sound that has never been heard before with the band. As if Dave didn't already have enough versatility, he has added to it, most notably in the intended billboard hit &quot;I Did It&quot; and the seductive &quot;Mother Father&quot; (track 9). &quot;I Did It&quot; took some time to grow on me, since it sounds so unpleasantly like Dave Matthews. His voice is low and almost mechanically enhanced in this song, and the band sounds synthesized, something long time fans might not appreciate. It's quite a new sound, however, when you're used to the easy, laid back style that the band has always favored.<br />Most of the tracks on this album sound too much like they want to appeal to a larger audience, and much of the band's original sound is lost behind an attempt at the new. It seems at times like Dave is stretching outside of his comfort zone, trying something new. I doubt it is for popularity--the band has always played for the sake of playing--but I can't help thinking it a shame that they were convinced by their producer to cut back their songs to sub-5 minute lengths (the longest track is only 4 minutes and change). This also will come as a disappointment to Dave fans, who--like I--think the endless instrumental interludes are the pinnacle of their work. It is my feeling that this album will best be heard live, and that the band should put out a live version.<br />Despite the amount of slightly above-average tracks, there are a few on here that don't shy away from the sounds of Dave's older albums, such as the final track, &quot;Everyday.&quot; It is a free and easy piece, and it incorporates some vocal harmonies that are very pleasing on the ears. The most popular track on the album, &quot;The Space Between,&quot; is the best effort by the band. It successfully bridges the gap between new and old, and it's a shame that more of the tracks couldn't live up to this standard.<br />In short, this album is a good attempt by an excellent band at trying something new. I would recommend it to die-hard Dave fans only, since it would doubtless be a necessity of theirs to have everything he puts out. For the more casual listener, however, I wouldn't spend the money.
B000002L68|5.0|Let's start with \\"Let's Go Crazy\\". Surely one of the most euphoric songs ever recorded, Prince kicks off his masterpiece with some words from the pulpit, then throws you into a wild groove that spirals into a room-filling synth riff. His final guitar solo slows down time before speeding it back up and ripping the bejeezus out of it--just about the hardest-rocking solo ever recorded. It finishes off with \\"Take me away!\\", a cheeky introduction to the brave new world that awaits the listener. I won't summarize the rest of the songs, but let you hear them on your own. Suffice to say, there are some mighty startling and wonderous things ahead. The final words on the album (screamed by fans in the audience) are \\"More!\\". You'll be screaming that yourself when it's over.
080017948X|5.0|Ok...what the director did was take an already-existing and already-done premis and took it farther in its idea, and quite well. Some other reviewer on here said &quot;When I saw this movie in the 80's, I loved it!&quot;...what?? This movie came out in 1993, so they obviously didn't know what they were talking about. But yes, Bill Murray is a funny man, but it just seems he keeps taking these screwball, b movie scripts, so he never has a chance to show off his real talent. This movie just exemplifies his talent and comedy...and his character transitions through the movie very well...I give it my seal of approval.
1552091090|1.0|Sorry, I know a lot of people really love this book and think its message is very sweet, but it gives me the willies. I get the same icked out feeling from The Runaway Bunny, FWIW.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I loved the movie, and was absolutely amazed by the quality of Ewan McGregor's and Nicole Kidman's singing, but some of these remakes just can't hold up to the originals so I can't bring myself to give it a 5. How can everyone love this near-sacriligious remake of Lady Marmalade, by the dirtiest of the dirty new pop-stars out there. Lil' Kim, Christina Aguilera, and the like took a great song and just trashed it up as far as I'm concerned. Once you get past the involvement of that bit and Beck's mediocre attempt at an already questionable song though, this cd is a great representation of a bizarre and flat out amazing film. Might as well go for it.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|Hey,<br />If you want to experience real life this is for your.  I know all the characters, from real life.  This is cool, irreverent and true.  Buy it if you want to see it from the inside.  Do not if you are uptight.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Just to make this clear from the start, I do listen to this kind of music.  So don't think I'm just some random guy who was offended by the lyrics b/c that really does not matter to me.  What I do not like about this album is what matters.. that being the music.<br />The album opens with possibly the dumbest &quot;intro&quot; I have ever heard.  It's some dumb electronic futuristic voice repeating &quot;Limp Bizkit's in the house&quot; over and over and gets really annoying.  What are they trying to do?  Brainwash us?  The pathetic intro jumps right into the horribly repetetive &quot;Hot Dog&quot;.  Here Fred Durst unsuccessfully tries to bash on NIN.  The only thing he accomplishes here is possibly a record number of &quot;f&quot; words (or is that what he was going for?).<br />These two disappointing opening tracks set the tone for the rest of the album.  Tracks like &quot;Full Nelson&quot;, &quot;Livin' it up&quot;, and especially &quot;Rollin'&quot; try to capture the sheer rock energy that &quot;Nookie&quot; did on their previous album, but fail miserably due to extreme redundancy.  Other more mellow tunes like &quot;The One&quot;, &quot;Boiler&quot;, and &quot;It'll be OK&quot; show how horrible Durst really is when it comes to actual singing other than rapping.  What is up with &quot;It'll be OK&quot; anyways?  Is he talking about suicide?  It seems like four tracks ago on &quot;Livin' it up&quot; he was talking about living the high life.  I didn't know it was possible for a guy could be that moody.  Three other tracks (&quot;Getcha Groove On&quot;, &quot;Rollin' Urban Assault&quot;, and &quot;Hold On&quot;) further prove how poor of an all-around singer Durst is by putting him up against not only more talented vocals (Scott Weiland) but against better rappers.  It's kind of ridiculous how easily Method Man, Redman, and DMX seem to take over &quot;Urban Assault&quot;.  Their smoother and quicker raps shred Durst's pathetic whines about and leave the listenerwondering whose album this really is...<br />Believe it or not, there are a few tracks I do enjoy.  The raw energy from &quot;My Generation&quot; never gets old.  Even more so, the awesome rap/rock from &quot;Take a Look Around&quot;, which is more well known as the MI:2 theme song, could in fact be the standout rock song of the year (it was nominated for a Grammy, you know).  And despite the annoying record scratching (&quot;check out my melody&quot;) on &quot;My Way&quot;, it still will go down as one of the greatest break-up songs in the rock 'n roll genre.<br />The two thing's that ultimately lead to this album's downfall are the fact that Durst tries to rap on 75% of the album and the poor attempts at creating worthwhile rock ballads.  If the band would have just stuck to this basic formula that made Significant Other so successful this would have been an excellent album.<br />Don't get me wrong, I am certainly not an avid Limp Bizkit hater.  I actually really liked Significant Other, if i didn't like it so much I wouldn't have bought this follow-up the first day it came out.  But needless to say Chocolate Starfish is if anything a dissapointment.  Hopefully the band can realize what they do best and drastically improve on their next album.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This CD is so good.  I bought this a while ago, and I still listen to it.  Its a good CD to cruise around to, and to play ball with.
B000002HMH|1.0|Before you buy this cd or any Metallica CD. LOOK ON THE BACK AND SEE IF BOB ROCK PRODUCED IT. If he did it's a LOAD OF S#@T. DO NOT BUY IT. The only exception is the Black Album. And even on that one they started to go soft on us.
B00001ODHJ|5.0|this is an awesome movie. It is not to be taken seriously, and is best viewed with a group of friends. It is funny, and action packed and Bruce Campbell is the MAN!  Come get some!
0767903862|5.0|Having lived in Melbourne and Sydne nearly my entire life, I have found this book to be most realistic.  His descriptions of the two cities are in incredible detail, and his ability to analyze the national sentiment is quite accurate. He is witty, and I found myself laughing most of the way through, but the account is also most informative.  I too haven't been to many of the parts that he describes, because I am normally at home getting laid, but I can imagine the many wonders that the country provides to all.
0393316041|5.0|This book was amazing, it tells many interesting anecdotes of this very interesting man. From Los Alamos to Las Vegas and many other interesting places, Feynman writes a wonderful book about the way he lived life. It's amazing to see how he wove details of how he would solve difficult problems with details of meeting women in bars. I'm going to read a many of his books as I can.
B000002MY3|4.0|I first heard &quot;Hand In My Pocket&quot; on a New York City radio station in the fall of 1995-That song just blew me away-Then in 1996,&quot;Ironic&quot; was released-I just loved that song-I eventually went out &amp; bought this album-There's not a weak track-Morissette,along with Joan Osborne &amp; Sheryl Crow,made it cool to rant &amp; rave about the opposite sex in the late 1990's-I have heard Alanis interviewed on VH-1's popular &quot;Behind The Music&quot;-She comes across as articulate &amp; genuine-I know that her second effort &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;,didn't sell as many copies as this album,but how can you top an album as good as this-It's virtually impossible.
B000002B30|4.0|Before purchasing this album,the only Springsteen cassette I had in my collection was his 1975 magnum opus &quot;Born To Run&quot;-One of the tracks on this collection &quot;Secret Garden&quot; recieved massive radio airplay in the spring &amp; summer of 1997 after being featured in the Tom Cruise movie &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;-That's what compelled me to purchase this album-Another movie song &quot;Streets Of Philadelphia&quot; from the Tom Hanks film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;,deservedly copped an Academy Award for Springsteen in 1994-My favorite tracks:&quot;Born To Run&quot;,&quot;Thunder Road&quot;,the aforementioned &quot;Secret Garden&quot; &amp; &quot;Streets Of Philadelphia&quot;,&quot;Born In The USA&quot;,&quot;The River&quot; &amp; &quot;Dancing In the Dark&quot;,which incidentally is Bruce's biggest Billboard &quot;Hot 100&quot; chartbuster-It peaked at #2 in the summer of 1984-Anyway,this is a terrific career retrospective for the ardent or casual fan of this New Jersey superstar.
B00004XONN|5.0|So, you say your beloved Radiohead has gone techno on you, making an album that is not the OK Computer: part 2 you anticipated?  Well shuttup and sit down.  What we have here is an innovative new album that comes at a time when rock music, hell music in general, is getting about as bland and unoriginal as the 80s (and I am excluding Pixies and Sonic Youth which are great 80s bands).  This is not OK Computer.  Those expecting OK Computer are in for serious disappointment.  Radiohead has evolved, as all good bands must.  Bands that do not evolve are the post '66, post-Brian Beach Boys.  They become obsolete.  Kid A makes you think, makes you search beneath its many layers for what it is.  If you want music devoid of depth, please, listen to Blink 182.   Kid A is for people searching for challenging music.  It is for open minds not closed ones.  If you have a closed mind, stay away.  If you like to think, and that is a rare thing...this is your album.
6305165912|5.0|This is one of those movies where you can just repeat lines out of the movie to make your friends laugh. &quot;Eight year olds Dude.&quot;  This movie is in my top 5 and is my favorite comedy of all time.  If you don't like it at first give it a second chance.  The movie is easier to follow the second time and you pay less attention to the details of the supposed abduction by the Nihilist.  Instead you get into the hilarious relationship of Dude and Walter. &quot;That's not her toe dude.&quot;
B000002P5R|5.0|I agree with the new fan from Boise who said this sounnds like Jimi  doing what he would want to do not the Guitar King thing that everyone has envisioned for him. The sound is fuzzy but warm and clear. Jimi adds some funk and Blooze to the mix on my favorites Dolly Dagger, and Earth Blues. This album is superb.
B00005B5L4|5.0|Der Kauf stand schon fest: Eine Neuauflage der &quot;Rumours&quot; von Fleetwood Mac als DVD-Audio! Schon als LP (...oh Gott, lang ist es her...) ein Ohrenschmau, erreichte &quot;Rumours&quot; durch die Verffentlichung als CD-Version noch einmal eine hrbare Aufwertung in der Transparenz des Klanges.

B000002G30|4.0|MM have opened for Hole and Soundgarden. MM have been on a Sabbath tribute CD. MM could be the metal band of the 21st century because of their guitar sounds courtesy of Ed Mundell. Wyndorf is the face and throat of this group but Ed is the true monster who is ultra-magnetized. Since MM is referred to as a Stoner band who has a psychedelic sound, ...I think Ed Mundell would agree with me.
B00005BL2A|2.0|Rather than bore you with the easy &quot;Exciter isn't that exciting&quot; cliche(oooh, I just did , didn't I?), I'll attempt to give an explanation as to why.  The beautiful melodies that sparkled over their earlier work are missing, only to be heard in echoes after repeated listenings.  A lot of these songs are plodding, derivative affairs, such as &quot;The Sweetest Condition&quot;, which cribs openly from &quot;The Sweetest Perfection&quot; from Violator, and &quot;The Dead of Night&quot;, a bizzare, unappealing mix between Iggy Pop's &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; and any Nine Inch Nails song.  These two tracks are perfect examples of whats wrong with the album, the tempo is all over the place and they are uncomfortable to listen to.  The whole album plays like that, the sequencing jerks you around, nothing flows very smoothly, and the inclusion of two completely forgettable instrumental tracks makes you wonder if they wanted to pad the running time on this zeppelin.  That said, true Depeche buffs will find solace in &quot;Shine&quot;, a haunting trance number, and the last two tracks, &quot;I am You&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot;, two lovely ballads.  But three songs do not make a whole album.  Prepare to be dissappointed.
0553277472|5.0|This is a brilliant piece of work. Although the book teaches a new way to look at reality, is not however new to the Eastern mind. Pirsig's notion of Quality is what Lao Tzu talked about 2600 years ago in the Tao Te Ching. Pirsig does mention this, however, later on a lot of the theories he comes up with, which are derived from Quality/the Tao, can be found in the Chuang Tzu, which is obvious that he hadn't read when he wrote ZATAOMM.<br />How can this book change the way you see the world? It can surely expand your mind. Religions tend to tell people that if you don't believe in X then you go to hell. And atheists think that all this God stuff is a figment of man's mind. What the Taoists and Pirsig argue is that Mythos, becomes reality when it is embedded in a society's &quot;a priori&quot; notions. The concept of &quot;a priori&quot; intellectualization means that we are all programmed (over time) to interpret a certain relative reality...and therefore the Christians and an African tribe that worships the sun, are BOTH living in a 100% real (relative to them) reality. No one is right or wrong. If we live and understand Quality/Tao, the undefined/pre-intellectual underlying reality, from which all diverse myriad realities come from, we can respect all religions, nations, ideas, opinions, and creatures. Who says are reality is more real that an ameba's? We can also finally join the hands of scientists (the classics) and the artists (the romantics) - and melt the object and subject into one entity.<br />It is too bad Pirsig never wrote an academic book, because even though this is studied in Universities, it is still classified as an autobiographical novel. <br />Get this book.

B000021Y77|1.0|I see a lot of glowing reviews for this movie and I just don't get it.  It's not &quot;deep&quot;, ingenious, brilliant, or anything else that I've heard it called.  Anyone who thinks this movie is thought provoking probably thinks Barney the dinosaur is a great philospher (seriously, get an education).  This is a gimmicky, kitchy film that is a combination of concepts that have all been used before.  The funny part is that they weren't great concepts the first time I saw them in other films.  But hey, nothing suceeds like excess...so lets bring it all together and make a really really bad movie!

B00005BL2A|5.0|This is a beautiful collection of songs.  Dave's arbitrary way of singing is exactly that, and always has been.  There is great beauty in simplicity.  His voice has never sounded better.  The cd is mainly dark and dreamy......  Nine Inch Nails it will never be.... and vice versa.  As always the songwriting and voices of Dave and Martin are worth their weight in gold.  Their ok stuff is of higher quality than most bands good stuff.  They will remain one of the most underrated and unique sounding bands... too bad... they paved the way....

0780631684|4.0|Ever wanted to cheat death?  Ever wonder what would happen if you did?  Well these students don't get the chance to ask before they find out firsthand, when death comes to claim it's victims after they escape a disaster.  Written by the writers of some classic X-Files episodes, Final Destination stands on it's own as a great thriller about the ulimate stalker - death itself.
B000002UWL|5.0|well it's already 11 years since Pet Shop Boys wrote this so underrated masterpiece...Of course it's supposed to be their musical peak, someone could say that after this they started their kind of &quot;decadence&quot;, which is arguable but anyway shows the power and the centrality of this wonderful album. This is where their image too has been at the most, I wouldn't say &quot;cold&quot;, because this is their most moving and emotional group of songs, but anyway contained, natural, really sort of philosophical, just before pointy hats...you can see it from the cover of the record This is such a sad record, but at the same time it's full of disappointment and hope. Being Boring is one the most perfect and pure portraits of friendship and loss feeling ever written, but the whole album moves to these themes with an increasing emotional power and ironic stuff about buried feelings and social powers (&quot;this must be the place&quot;, the stunning orchestrated &quot;only the wind&quot;, &quot;so hard&quot; and &quot;jealousy&quot;). The only slightly out of album's feeling note,on the production, is &quot;seriously&quot;, which released as a single remix in 1991 was kept slower, more hip-hop and focused on the haunting sarcasm of Tennant's words against the rock'n roll stars supposed to be saving the planet with their only efforce. If &quot;Dj culture&quot; and &quot;Miserablism&quot; were now in the record, they would fit really well, i think, and it would be even more stunning than now. Pet Shop Boys at their deepest and not-so-easy side, though as ever pop...Don't you think PSB are a bit underrated today? In a world of lab-created Aguileras,on years seen Behaviour stuff only once or twice on MTV and all the rest of it, which is a shame. Will one day this magical album surface for a while in people's ears?
6305807086|2.0|I'm not going to say this was a BAD movie, it just wasn't a very good one.  Somehow the comedy was lost in the wierdness and twisted thinkings of the movie.  This movie was just strange.  Most unusual is just thinking about the later part of the story, with Malkovich becoming the puppeteer, and how that would fit in real life.  While there are some entertaining moments, and some interesting ideas posed, they are lost by the imagery of the darker humor, such as the animal cage part.  This is one of those movies that's too silly to be a drama, and too seriously written to be a comedy.
6305265666|5.0|This is a GREAT movie version of Cinderella.  It has a few minor changes from the original story; but it is a fully-fleshed out story.  Drew Barrymore does a FANTASTIC job as the stepdaughter.  The stepmother if perfectly evil, and yet at times, you almost feel sorry for her.  There is a slight change in the way the stepsisters act, which i really like.  One of them, although being rich and spoiled, still tends to be more on Cinderella's side.  Throwing Leonardo Da Vinci into the story really made it great, as well!  That extra little twist was perfect!  :&gt;  I definitely recommend it!  And the DVD includes the trailer, which uses 2 great songs as well (unfortunately, these 2 songs from the trailer are NOT on the soundtrack).  Not really anything else extra on the DVD though, which was a little disappointing.
0812550757|4.0|Ender's Game was one of the best books I have ever read.  This book doesn't tell the same kind of story, it is a nicer story, fucosing more on redemption than the first book.  In Ender's Game, the story is of a boy who was raised by the military to become a super soldier, and is responsible for the worst act mankind has ever done.  In this book, Ender has become Speaker for The Dead, condemning his actions in the first book.  Now faced with another chance, he attempts to atone his actions by saving the life of another race.  Not as powerful a story, but an enjoying sci-fi epic.
6305181772|5.0|Tom Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt, a member of an elite espionage team headed by Jim Phelps(Jon Voight).  What was thought to be a routine survellance assignment goes all wrong and leaves Ethan framed for the death of his team.  Desperate to uncover the truth and find the mole he goes on the run.  But will Ethan want to believe the truth when he discovers it?<br />This is a clever movie that has it all, plenty of suspence action and a great plot.  This is by far superior to the sequel.  The director Brian De Palma is a genious and shows it with breathtaking shot after shot.  The supporting cast is perfect including Jean Reno and Ving Rhames.  This is a movie I can watch over and over.  I highly recommended.  The film is presented in wide and full screen, DD 5.1 and has a theatrical trailer.
0141301139|5.0|I really like this book. It is good for younger kids in 2nd-4th grade. It is funny and the story is very good. I have nothing more to say about this fantastic book. READ IT NOW!
B00003CXDZ|4.0|I had the most enjoyable time watching this one.  This is the &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; of the 21st century.  Patrick Swayze watch your back cuz Ewan McGregor has got your number in the hip-shaking game.  Plus he has the voice to back it up too.  When I heard him sing for the first time, I forgot that I was in a theatre and not in heaven.  The other star, Ms. Kidman, was spectacular in her own right.  One of her better performances since &quot;Days of Thunder.&quot;  The movie wanted me to get up and dance in the theatre aisle, as i did when i saw &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;  I never knew i could have &quot;the time of my life&quot; again!
0140277447|4.0|This book had been on my shelf for a long time, after the recent discussions about Disney, political correctness and &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; I read it, and I'm very glad I did.  Skip the silly movie and read this instead.  <br />As many others have noted the story is a compelling and a terrifying one.  Ms. Chang tries to present both sides of the story, but the nature of the crime is so enormous that her objectivity sometimes fails her.  <br />Despite the claim by the Japanese reviewers that only &quot;20,000&quot; were murdered.  A figure of 20,000 military plus 200,000 to 300,000 civilian death seems to be accepted.  Frankly, it doesn't matter the brutality of the murders speaks for themselves. <br />Ms. Chang other claim is that the 2nd rape of Nanking was the downplaying of the atrocity by the Japanese with tact acceptance by the US.  Here she is on pretty strong ground.  It is obvious after reading the one star reviews from many Japanese citizens, that a significant group of Japanese have not fully accepted their countries guilt<br />As a student of WWII, I was aware of Rape of Nanking.  However, when pulled eight WWII books of my shelves I was shocked to see only two references.  All of the books discussed the attack on the gunboat Panay, which was sent to evacuate foreigner trapped in Nanking.  How ironic that an attack which killed a handful of American and westerns merits discussion, yet a massacre right next door doesn't.<br />This is not the definitive history book on the Rape of Nanking. However, if you think that Japan was a victim in WWII read this.
0062502182|5.0|There is an old Yogic saying: When the student is ready, the guru will appear. I think that phrase can apply to this book. The simplicity of the language and the fantastic tone of the story gives a lot of room for personal interpretation -- and it's in your personal interpretations where you'll find the fruits of the book. This book is not for everyone, as the mixed reviews on this site has shown. But if you like to think about religion, life, the meaning of self-existence and God, you'll find that there is not a wasted word on these 167 pages. Personally, I think the beauty of this book is not in the story, but in your personal reading of the story. You are the lake in the Prologue -- beholding your own beauty in Narcissus' eyes. This is a Narcissistic book, a cool fable, and it may be just what you need.
0316926345|5.0|I loved this book. For those that do love this book it probably says something questionable about them.  I first thought of this book as Existentialism meets Catholicism, in a uniquely English sardonic way. I think there is more to it than that. It is a about a man in conflict with the noise of life, he finds himself through the love of a college mate who he engages in undergrate frivolity with, despite the urgings of a graduate student relative.  The haunting aspect of this novel maybe that the noise of life turns out to be his wife, his children, as well as his relationship with the army, and his own dad.  The man that, if any, can be given credit for helping the narrator find himself, ends up losing himself.  They all seem to lose themselves, in the end, except for one saving grace, their Catholic faith - which the narrator, despite much incredulity, in the begininning, also seems to fall into.  After reading the reviews posted here I think it is safe to say that you may or may not like this book to the extreme.  However, there does seem to be a universal love of the 1982 video series, with Jeremy Irons. The thred that seems to run through the Evelyn Waugh books, that I have read thus far, is the mockery of guru sorts that are often found in Existential novels. Maybe he is saying that one should not expect to save themselves, or find meaning, in anything but faith. The rest is noise.  It is just troubling what the noise turns out to be.<br /><br />Added in 2016:<br />Unfortunately, in 2016, after reading Proust, I have to say that this book is basically religious propaganda and a rip off of In Search of Lost Time.
0316286443|4.0|I absolutely love Kevyn Aucoin.  He is not only very talented and extremely creative, but he also seems to genuinely love and respect women.  I think he was one of the people responsible for Courtney Love's transformation a few years back.  You will not believe how much he makes celebrities look like other people, it is mind-blowing.  (If any of you know who the hilarious Amy Sedaris is and have seen her on &quot;Strangers with Candy,&quot; you MUST look at this book!) This book is very inspiring, even to &quot;every day&quot; people.<br />HOWEVER...<br />Spare me the political stuff.  I really felt offended by some of the things he says.  At one point he refers to 50s family values being questionable.  I wish he had either explained himself a little or omitted it.  Not all of the women reading his book are single, fabulous 20-somethings living in NYC or LA.  Some of us are stay-at-home mothers, housewives, etc., and I for one felt a little, I guess, excluded.  It just ruined the book for me in a way (hence the 4 stars).  There are some hypocritical statements in the book, if you ask me.  Not sure why he feels he needs to include them. I'll still look at it again, but I'll mostly avoid the print, and I probably won't buy it for the aforementioned reasons(although I do have his last book).
B00003CWL6|5.0|On first viewing, I knew absolutely nothing about this film.  I am glad for that.  This is one of those movies that draws one into a journey filled with unexpected twists and turns.  I understand that this was Alan Ball's first film script.  Most impressive.<br />Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham and is the anchor of the story.  However, all of the other central characters are extremely well-developed--and terribly interesting.  It might be a bit cynical, but there seem to be quite a number of people who can actually identify with the story and characters.  Not the typical &quot;feel-good&quot; movie, to be sure.  But it is a compelling one.<br />The performances are likewise deep and true.  The bottom line is that I cannot say enough good things about this film.  In fact, even though I own the DVD, whenever a cable network airs it, I find myself watching.  I always find something new.  <br />Get this one.  If you like movies, you'll love it.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|To begin, I went into the theater with extremely high expectations of this film, in hopes that I would leave the theater with a smile upon my face and a feeling of satisfaction for the months I have been waiting to see this film.  All dreams and expectations were fulfilled in the two hours which I sat in the theater.  From the first frame to the final image of the curtain and the conductor I sat in awe and silence as the movie enveloped me into its world.  In left the theater in a hurry to go and see if I could sneak into another theater to see it again.  In short, this is a true masterpiece.    Baz Luhrmann, of Romeo + Juliet fame, here introduces us to his own Romeo (Christian) and Juliet (Satine) the sparkling diamond in the crown that is the Moulin Rouge.  The film begins with Christian, a young writer, leaving his home in England and going to Paris to live the bohemian lifestyle.  Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all things Love.  Soon we are introduced to Toulouse-Lautrec (Leguizamo), a midget who is also an actor and seeker of the bohemian revolution.  As the show goes on we learn how Lautrec was hired with his troop to write a show for the Moulin Rogue.  However, when Christian is asked to assist in the production, the writer leaves and Christian is left as the sole writer.  Soon after, the group of men go to the Moulin Rouge gentlemen's-club of sorts, where they meet up with Zidler, the manager of the club.  This opening shot of the club is the first visceral onslaught of many.  It is a wild tornado of sweeping camera shots and fluid shots which come together in a bit of a mess, but by the end of the film one becomes use to Luhrmann's nutty styles and artistic choices.  When the first dance is over, Satine descends from the ceiling and so begins the tale of mistaken identity, where Satine thinks that the Duke, who is the man who will be paying to transform the Moulin Rouge into a theater, is actually Christian.  From this point on the film begins to show us how one can have comedy and drama exist in perfect harmony.    The film goes on in a roller coaster ride of sorts, twisting and turning and through it all we sit back, enjoy, smile, frown, and are relived in the end, yet, like any good roller coaster, we want to go back again.  Every single shot in this film is a picture stolen from the hidden safes of the worlds greatest artists, or perhaps the worlds greatest artist has simply opened his safe and shown the whole world his vision.  Baz Luhrmann takes on classic pieces of music like, Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend to Your Song by Elton John, to modern classics like Nirvanas \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" to Sting's \\"Roxanne\\".  Moulin Rogue is an escape from the ordinary and makes us remember why we go the theater.  This film, hopefully, will be accepted by all facets of the industry, and with any luck films which intertwine old and new styles as this one has, will be made more often.  In my mind Moulin Rouge is an instant classic which takes bold risks and pushes the envelope of what we consider good and what we consider outlandish together in one film that is far beyond good and a film which will hopefully affect the future of film making.  In short, I loved this film and I intend to see many more times.  If you see one picture this year or any year, Moulin Rouge should be it.
B00005176F|5.0|Having seen my brother buy album after album from these blokes, I got a really good sense of Blurs' sound. And yet, I could never be bothered to purchase one for my self. It's not that I didn't like them, my tastes in muzik were bringing me in different directions. Well, no more. I saw The Best Of in the store for [price], looked at the track listing and saw some songs that I knew I liked; Boys and Girls, Charmless Man, Parklife, Song 2(sans Intel advert) so on and so forth. <br />Long story short, this album is fantastic.<br />And, as a newcomer, so to speak, what better place to start than the tried and tested best tracks? (Currently grooving to Music is My Radar). Now to go and bolster my collection with all their albums. I am hooked.<br />As a funny foot note, I can remember the days of Oasis endlessly bagging on Blur. Really in the most rude and vile of ways. \\"I hope they get AIDS\\", and much worse. Well, those battles are long over, and Oasis has slipped into the kind of obscurity that the former Soviet Union now enjoys. Can you even give away an Oasis album these days?

B00005JG6R|5.0|Seriously, this is one of the best movies of all time. Every anime fan owns a copy of this movie. Even if you aren't a fan of anime, you must see Akira before you can call yourself a movie buff. This movie is like good music. The desire to experience it will never totally go away. Even if you get tired of it after many viewings, you WILL get the urge to view it again. I guarantee it. Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen this movie, make it a priority.
B000003TA4|3.0|Kurt Cobain, was a tragic, misunderstood genious.  It is horrible that his life ended so tragically at his own hands.  From the wonderful song &quot;Come as you are&quot;  to the haunting &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, his genious shines through.  What he's missing is a wonderful duet with the lovely and talented, Celine Dion, the greatest singer ever.  It is a devastating tragedy that the world will never get to hear the beautiful remix of &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot;, in which I sang in perfect harmony (as usual,  I am after all Celine Dion, the greatest singer ever), with Kurt.  Courtney Love,  who is not the greatest singer ever, is holding the recordings from the world.  You can, however, look forward to me touring with Black Sabbath on their reunion tour.
0792898605|5.0|Seriously, this is one of the best movies of all time.  Every anime fan owns a copy of this movie.  Even if you aren't a fan of anime, you must see Akira before you can call yourself a movie buff.  This movie is like good music.  The desire to experience it will never totally go away.  Even if you get tired of it after many viewings, you WILL get the urge to view it again.  I guarantee it.  Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen this movie, make it a priority.  <br />Although I am reviewing the subtitled edition, I personally prefer the dubbed version.
B00003CXQX|5.0|This movie was soooooooo good. I have seen it 15 TIMES! It's hilarious, and David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, and Patrick Warburton make it even better!! This is my ALL TIME FAVORITE Disney movie!! Everyone should watch this movie at LEAST once! WATCH IT!
B000002L82|5.0|Who could listen to the opening riff of \\"Age of Consent\\" and not be hooked? My first hearing of that remains a high point of my encounters with pop culture. I agree with other reviewers who've said that the album in its original form without \\"Blue Monday\\" was \\"better\\"; it was, but I'm still glad to have it, since I'm not a perfectionist about keeping cultural artifacts in some pristine state.
B00005HU32|5.0|ok, we all know Here with me and Thankyou. but some of us don't know Worthless - this is one of the best songs i have ever had!!!! it has very exciting music and the lyrics are amazing.i think Faithless help Dido do that track. the second bonus track is Me, a song that i couldn't find anywhere else in the net. This No Angel version is a must-have-cd for Dido's fans. No Angel is very interesting album, good pop/dance/electromic/rock music. it's for everyone. she's the best.
B00005B36H|5.0|To a music lover in New York, you obviously have no sence of music.  This album is mixed greatly and shows emotions.  The raising and lowing of tone and music is done very well.  It shows you have no taste if you compare nsync to tool.  The work of an artist that actually writes his music obvioulsy comes from emotion.  How coud u compare nsync a band who has everything written out for them and coriographed to tool. Don't listen to this guy, if u liked ANEIMA you'll like this.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I think we should see 'Hannibal' and 'Silence of the Lambs' as two different films. We shouldn't expect the same style as in the 'Silence of the Lambs'. Even the books were different.
B0000069NM|2.0|ALL THE BELOW IS MY OPINION--TAKE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.<br />I have spent serious time with this album. I gave myself time before settling on an opinion. I have learned some of the material (and even performed it in public) and have a good knowledge of MMW and Scofield.  I like all kinds of music.  This is my first negative review.<br />In my opinion (take this with a grain of salt) the musical style is embarrassingly bad. Think of a bad acting company doing an improvisation where all they do is assume awkward, stilted poses out of context.  Now imagine that these contortions are isolated microevents that add up to nothing.  A Go Go is the musical equivalent of this visual image.  <br />For those seeking a good-feeling groove or swing, look elsewhere.  There's a lot of it out there (including on other Scofield).<br />All the musicians on the record are tremendously gifted; the recording sound is good.  That's why I give it a charity 2 stars.  Maybe these gifted musicians are groping around for something new to do.  I hope they move past this kind of awkward nonsense quickly.<br />For me, this album was a waste of money.  If you are a collector, maybe it is worth it to you.
B00003CXN4|5.0|TRAFFIC is a film about three stories that are interconnected and share the same common theme: the war on drugs. First we have a politician who discovers that his daughter has developed her own drug addiction. Then we have a pregnant woman who has found out that her husband was arrested for smuggling drugs and she is willing to do anything to get him out of jail. And at last we have a Mexican cop who is caught between government officials in the U.S. and in Mexico that want control over trading drugs back and forth across the Mexican border. This movie was extremely dramatic and it had me caught up in the characters and the things that are happening to them. At times, it feels as if you're watching a real-life documentary because of the way the movie was filmed. Definitley one of the best movies to come out in 2000.
B000001FAS|5.0|The Eat a Peach Album was my first album purchase. It remains my favortie southern rock album of all time, I never tire of the tunes. Even though there are many good tracks, Blue Sky is my favorite. If only I could play the guitar like Dicky Betts!, its fun pretending anyway.
B00005AFVR|5.0|A rewiew like this is really not neccessary for any true &quot;Boss&quot; fan. We all know and appreciate the music of the him and the E Street Band. What some people may not know about this album though is the little surprise which can be found inside. Or maybe you have noticed something but were not quite sure what it was.  Heres the surprise. This double album should have a total of 19 songs. But there is a song #20 to be found. The first CD shows 10 Songs, the last is (should be)&quot;Out in the Street&quot;. Curiously enough, &quot;Born to Run&quot; kicks in just when you thought the CD was finished.  This CD has a definate place in any serious &quot;Boss&quot; collection. His music is timeless.
B00004U8H4|3.0|Not as violent nor as over the top as its notorious source.  Although I admired the satirical boldness with which it equates the figurative and literal bloodlust/murderous impulses of those engendered by corporate culture and those experienced by serial killers (I'll let you figure out which is which), it's still not a easy film to sit through.  There are some excellent scenes however, such as the business cards scene and Patrick Bateman's hilariously unnerving analysis of music from Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, etc.  As a music fan, I find the implication that only the psychotic fringe would enjoy soporific Top 40 pop music completely delightful.  The problem with the film is that, like its source, it is all one note and it becomes irritating and uncomfortable after awhile.  And the film takes a easy way out near the end to make things more palatable to the audience (we'll henceforth refer to this type of travesty as the 'Fight Club' Syndrome).  However, this film is not without its share of brilliance, foremost of which is how Harron aims a scathing satire, even more so than the one directed at corporate culture, towards us, the people in the audience, for our desire to be entertained by violence and horror.  Overall, Mary Harron didn't really capture the over-the-toppedness of the novel but she nailed down the essential spirit of the book.
B00003CWN3|4.0|A powerful film and Hilary Swank deserves the Oscar.  No contest.  Too bad Chloe Sevigny's nuanced performance wasn't recognized as well. Really tough to watch some parts of this movie.  Although films about white-trash-trailer-park life are almost always unbelievable because of the attractive cast (with the exception of &quot;Gummo&quot;, natch), there were many little details about this segment of society that felt authentic.
B00003CXMG|4.0|Yes, it's another coming-of-age film but I was completely drawn in because so many details of the 70's-milieu rock scene seem so genuine and accurate -- the characters, the dialogue, the clothing, the settings, the music -- it's all there.  Even the name 'Stillwater' recalls a Lynyrd Skynyrd-type band from the mid-70's.  The scene in which William Miller becomes mesmerized by the album cover art while listening to The Who really hit a nerve with me.  This is exactly how rock fandom begins, the discovery of music and lyrics that seems to be speaking directly and only to you.  Much of the rock world that stays on the periphery of the familiar coming-of-age story is fascinating, and because it feels like it had been informed by insider knowledge, I felt like I had been brought along for the tour.  Moreover, Crowe inserts us into an eminently fascinating period of rock 'n roll, when it was going through one of its cyclical downturns.  On one side, rock music was being slowly strangled by the increasing pursuit of profits by music labels and their increasingly sinister treatment of their artists, and on the other side, there was the oncoming juggernaut of the more danceable, manufactured musical form of disco.  Another highlight for me is Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Lester Bangs.  Why Hoffman is not already a Hollywood star I have no clue.  Crudup, Hudson and McDormand are also very strong and they will certainly contend for Oscar recognition.  My only quibble about the film is that it is content with depicting everything through rose-coloured glasses.  Even the way the film ends with all the loose ends neatly tied up and everybody happy and intact seems a little too disingenuous.  Crowe seems to have ignored the rampant nihilism and misanthropy that existed at the time.  The only person in the whole film who comes off looking like an a**hole is the screeching associate editor of Rolling Stone, and she appears onscreen for only a couple of minutes.  It's strange that although Crowe's semi-alter-ego learns the important journalistic lesson of being &quot;honest and unmerciful&quot;, that advice appears to have escaped Crowe.  But then I guess this is why he's a filmmaker and not a journalist.
B000003TAR|4.0|I find In Utero more interesting to listen to in 2001 than Nevermind. Kurt Cobain easily surpasses Dave Grohl's current work, even in death. Frances Farmer is a great track, so is Dumb, which is pretty similar to a number of Beatles track. If Kurt is overlooking the music business from heaven he'd be unimpressed with the lack of imagination of The Foo Fighters embrace. I mean they are embarrassing and trivial musicians, Kurt might want to be reincarnated just to prove how shallow his successors have become, that includes Courtney Love.
0307155102|5.0|It can now be said that &quot;Richard Scarry's Best Word Book Ever&quot; is multi-generational.  Thirty years ago my mother presented this book to my then 18 month old son.  As a new mother I was unfamiliar with &quot;popular&quot; children's books, and my child was beginning to receive many gifts of books - but this one was an immediate favorite both with my son and with me.  The illustrations are vivid and delightful, quickly capturing the attention of even &quot;short span&quot; toddlers.  The emphasis in this large, hard bound volume is to present the child with objects, places, and activities which are familiar even to the nonverbal toddler, allowing the child to begin expanded vocabulary development.  What begins with mommy or daddy asking, &quot;..can you find the apple?&quot; quickly leads to the child pointing to the illustration and proudly speaking, &quot;Apple!&quot;  This in turn, promotes the childs desire to expand and identify another object, color, or number!  No matter that the two year old points to the kitchen stove and says, &quot;hot&quot;, the multiple process of critical thinking combined with advancing verbal skills maintains age appropriate advancement.  Eventually the child progresses to the concepts of activities and the beginnings of sentence structure.  But it doesn't stop there; each illustration is accurately identified with a discriptive word and even several years later you may find your first or second grader using this book as a combination dictionary/spelling aid.<br />That first volume given to my child was always at the top of the &quot;stacks&quot; (i.e. no matter how messey the bedroom, the &quot;Best Word Book Ever&quot; could easily be located.)  From his growing hands it was passed to four successive siblings.  Taped up and dog-eared, but never abused, this wonderful book gave each of my children an edge-up on vocabulary development.  No wonder then that when my first grandchild began to show signs of frustration when he did not yet have the &quot;name&quot; for what he wanted that grandma quickly got on-line to order &quot;Richard Scarry's Best Word Book Ever.&quot;  We have had this treasure for slightly over a week and every day Andrew eagerly searches for a comfortable lap to help him explore what is already his &quot;favorite&quot; book.  He adds to his speaking skills at least one and often two or three words daily!<br />The only (criticism is to strong a word) &quot;suggestion&quot; I would offer to the publishers is some possible updating; my grandson cannot relate to televisions with &quot;rabbit ears&quot;, telephones now are both cordless and mobile, and the addition of an illustrated computer would be appropriate and welcome. Thankfully, the best of everyday life remains basically unchanged: homes and families still have the same common features from bedrooms to kitchens, and brushing teeth to pots and pans; a firetruck is red, a monkey lives at the zoo, elephants are also at the circus, and teachers &quot;live&quot; in colorful classrooms.  The &quot;Magic&quot; is still there!
6304167660|3.0|It was not as good as I thought it would be. And it really did not have any romance in it it was pretty much just guy talk and for me being a girl it got boring.
0679879269|4.0|Phillip Pullman's 3rd His Dark Materials Book is beautifully written and the more you read Pullman the more you realise what a genius he must be. The story line is a slight disapointment after Northern Lights and The Subtle Knife both of which sucked you into the dark, strange world of Phillip Pullman's mind. In this book Pullman displays his knowledge and descriptive power but can't quite capture the magic. Still, it's not that bad a book.
0525945636|5.0|I don't think that I've ever read a book of this length faster.  This books doesn't waste any time in grabbing hold of the reader.  The characters are all superb.  I want to be Dr. Claude 'Luke' Lucas.  He is practically an American James Bond.  Women want him and men want to be him.  There isn't a single dull moment in this book and quite frankly I don't care about it's historical accuracy the story is second to none.  Bravo Ken Follett!

0553296981|5.0|This book is actually the diary of Anne Frank, a young Jewish girl living during WWI. She writes about love, her emotions, and what it is like living her life in hiding from the nazis. Finding who her true friends are and who is really &quot;there&quot; for her she describes everything that goes on in her life. Moving from place to place to escape from Hitler's wrath her family ends up in Holland in an old building, behind a secret bookcase that leads to her &quot;Secret Annex&quot;. She lives in the &quot;Secret Annex&quot; for over three long years with one other family, and an old man. Telling her adventures in her hiding place she makes the reader feel as if they were there beside her. She falls in love with one of the people hiding with her and lives there happily with him for a long time. She describes herself as a &quot;little bundle on contradictions&quot; and a bit on the &quot;cheeky&quot; side. I find her very loving and sweet but on the outside she tries to hide her true feelings from mostly everyone. This noisy and annoying girl is really a shy teenager who wishes to be left in peace and feels as if no one understands her. Finding that everyone is there for her in her time of need she tries to enjoy the world around her. Figuring out the true meaning of life, she lives a short, yet happy one during this long war and lives peacefully until she is almost 15.
0061020680|5.0|My first Pratchett book... and certainly not the last!!! Quick, concise character development and great dollops of humour make for an exciting read.<br />I recommend this book to any discerning reader, young or old.<br />Buy it... now! Go! Shoo!
B00003CXCS|3.0|I have to admit, my girlfriend likes it better than I. The scenery is breathtaking, but the musical itself is only good... NOT excellent. A far, far better musical is \\"My Fair Lady\\" just for sheer entertainment value. The dialogue is better, the plot is more interesting and well developed, and the lyrics are far more mature. But I do like the \\"Sound of Music\\" and all should have it for a wonderful family experience. \\"My Fair Lady\\" is better appreciated among adults...
B00005BL2A|2.0|I will agree to disagree with the majority of negative reviews regarding this album, in that this isn't a horrible album.  However, it is extremely lacking in what has become the past power of Depeche Mode.<br />There are few, if many memorable, hooks. While the production is sound, the entire album drones on sleepily for nearly 57 minutes.  I am quite disappointed in this effort and regret shelling out the bucks for it.<br />No doubt, if you are a Depeche Mode fan, you have probably bought this album.  While still beautifully poetic in its lyrics, it is certainly lacking in depth.
B000002U8G|4.0|Meddle probably marks what would prove to be the start of the most productive and innovative period in Pink Floyd's career. It also was the first to have the trademark Pink Floyd sound. David Gilmour finally took his right place in the band and became the leading musical force within the group. After Atom Heart Mother the band had run out of ideas and were &quot;creatively bankrupt&quot; as drummer Nick Mason put it at the time. Meddle also then marks a radical departure and a new way of making music for the band.<br />The album opens with &quot;One of These Days&quot; a bass-liden song that went on to become a concert favorite. The track also features a hypnotic vibrato section in which the melody from the Dr Who theme can be heard (Water's joke). &quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot; brings the listener down to a gentle song that at the time was seen as filler but stands up as a truly beautiful track dominated by Gilmour's overlaid acoustic and electric slide guitar. &quot;Fearless&quot; owes it's sound to Syd Barret, founding member, who once showed Roger Waters a tuning he had run across (open G tuning). The song ends with a recording of Liverpool F.C. football fans singing Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot; which was adopted as almost a theme song by fans. &quot;San Tropez&quot; was written as filler track so the album could go the press on time and sounds it part in an un-Floyd jazzy style. &quot;Seamus&quot; is a joke by the band. Seamus was a dog that was trained to yowl every time he heard the blues. So, he was brought into the studios and the band, stoned, recorded the track. It easily could have been left off the album. Finally, the pinnacle of the album and worth the price alone, &quot;Echoes&quot;. This 23 minute epic took up one whole side of the original LP was indeed a daring experiment.  Considered by many fans to be the finest rack the band ever recorded, &quot;Echoes&quot; is an amazing suite of improvised and segued pieces. There was no precedent for it or at least in the Floyd's musical cannon. In closing, Meddle may be a little uneven mainly due to the filler tracks sandwiched between the monsters of &quot;One of These Days&quot; and &quot;Echoes&quot; but is one of Pink Floyd's finest works.
0944379044|3.0|Hitler's writing style is very ponderous and rambling.  That may be due in part to the translation, but I doubt it.  Hitler seems to have a few catch phrases that mesmerized the unthinking German worker, and he just kept repeating them until everyone was stirred up.  It is too bad that the rest of the world did not read the book and take him more seriously.  It might have avoided a lot of trouble later on.
B00005BJPO|5.0|This is one of the best anime movies that I have seen in a long time.  The movie is VERY complex and it takes a few views to understand it completely, which is good, because you want to watch it more than once.  The movie starts out as just a bunch of street punks that have motorcycle wars, but a problem erupts in the movie that becomes an international crisis.  This is a great movie that I recommend for all.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I saw it twice on the opening day. It is such a beauitful film. It gives so much to the movie watcher, love, joy, sadness, everything!!!!! By aware of the &quot;stupid american movie watcher&quot;. Both times I went &quot;people&quot; who could not understand anything that was not funny were talking and, well, Amazon will not let me say what I felt for those people. Just a fare warning. I suggest a mid-day show when the &quot;kids&quot; are in school.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Amazing.  Profound. Enthralling.  Supersonic.  Warm.  Uplifting. Hopeful.  Beautiful.  The sounds of Mother Nature turning the sun on and off.  Amazing.
B00005BL2A|3.0|Starting with the good points,  Exciter has a raw feel to it that allows the music to flow naturally.  It has enough good elements from Songs of Faith and Devotion and Violator to make any avid DM fan pan for it at their local record dealer (or online retailer).  It has the emotion, the energy, the synthesizers and dance rythm's from DM that we've all grown to love. But it's all been done before....<br />After Ultra, an underappreciated DM album that bears alot of close production to Violator, one might be misled to believe that DM's triumphant return would be Exciter.  Rather, Exciter is a subpar release with a couple good songs from a once great band.<br />The good - Shine, Breathe, and Goodnight Lovers are Mode in classic form.  Shine is a great could easily find it's way on Violator if it truly desired to.  Gahan's tortured vocal coupled with Gore's lyrics of longing are tops, and if the rest of the album would have followed suit, this would've been classic.<br />Breathe is another Biblical rant from Gore, mentioning recognizable characters from the Bible to an object of his affection to state his case of love.  And it's strong and has a very credible performance with Gore's recognizable aches and tears in his vocal performance of the song.<br />Goodnight Lovers is the mistaken light at the end of the tunnel found on the end of just about every DM album.  A happy tone is coupled with ironic lyrics like &quot;When you're born a lover, you're born to suffer.&quot;  Here, Gore sounds like a tortured romantic more than he ever has. Gore's at a certain height of writing where the song in content has bleakness, but the idea of love and loss are clearly defined and sincere - not dark and brooding just for the sake of it.<br />The bad - and not necessarily bad, but boring and tired.  Dream On has a great beat and the lyrics are wonderful, but it loses steam quick, as it's very repetitive.  I feel Loved sounds like a New Order throwaway (though it's admittedly very danceable, in an 80s sorta way).  Freelove is probably the better of these songs, but brings little new to the dm field - it's very slow moving and the lyrics a little too..well little for gore's standards -&quot;And I'm only here to bring you free love/ let's make it clear that this is free love/no hidden catch/no strings attached/just free love&quot;...full of cliche's an insincerity, it's not great dm fare.  Comatose and When the Body Speaks are also OK songs, but just nothing new.<br />The ugly - Years ago I thought DM could release a great instrumental album, hearing compostions on Music for the Masses and Violator..but here, DM uses instrumentals as uninspired filler that disrupts any flow the album has.  Lovetheme halts the album with an unnecessary ambient mix of bass and sonic rhythms, while Easy Tiger is pure filler, obnoxious, misplaced sound.  <br />The real sadness on the album though is the Dead of Night.  Dead of Night is potentially a great song.  Musically, it's got the roaring guitars of SoFaD and the unerving pulsating rhythms of Personal Jesus.  What defeats the song are the horrendous lyrics..right from the opening &quot;we're the horniest boys..&quot; a listener want to pull out the telephone to call Marty and ask him if those words really crept out of his pen.  Gahan's vocal sounds tired and strained, as he screams some of the childish lyrics.<br />That's Exciter.  Nothing Exciting, but representative of a gradual decline.  It has some really good songs coupled with a mix of tiring tracks that are all too recognizable to DM fans, but bring a some pleasure.  The rest just show too much age and the boys trying to hard to do something new and falling flat.
014028009X|5.0|BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is one of the funniest books ever.  Written in the form of a journal,  Bridget starts each entry with a set of statistics: alchohol consumed; cigarettes smoked; current weight; etc...   You can watch her alchohol and cigarette consumption go up and down as her moods change day by day.  <br />Bridget's journal chronicles life as a 30-something single gal living in London and living alone.  She's wishing she has a steady boyfriend.  She finally gets involved with her boss Daniel Cleaver, and we watch as they progress from madly in lust to &quot;ho hum&quot;.... of course she later learns what a scum bag he is and so she's back to square one.  She also is fixed up with child hood friend Mark Darcy, who annoys her to no end.  <br />Besides trying to find that Mr Right, she's also dealing with a mother who is going through a mid life crisis and that's a story unto itself.  And her on-going struggle with self improvement schemes is a riot.<br />Bridget came across to me as someone who has a lot of self esteem, but at the same time is desperately trying to convince herself and others that she's ok the way she is.   She's very vocal about her opinions, never gives up either when things are looking down.    I really liked Bridget as a character, and saw a lot of her in me.   Maybe that's why I liked this book so much.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge KICKS!  They have not made a film like this since DeMille was alive!  Ignore the hype, ignore the really bad trailers (made me not want to see it - I was dragged to it) - Just GO SEE IT.  This is what movies are all about!  Just trust me - go see it.  Logoff right now and go see it.  I'm not kidding - go see it right now!  You will thank me - trust me!<br />And what you will really like is how many of the lines refer to pop songs from the past several decades, and gets away with it!  In fact, it actually adds a bit of flavor that I don't think would work in any other movie by any other screenwriter.  The costumes were great, the makeup wonderful, the script unlike anything ever produced in the past 20-30 years (in a very good sense), and the cinematography and editing being absolutely astounding to the point that you will be floored.  It is THAT GOOD.  Go see it.
1577311523|5.0|Indeed Eckhart Tolle's book &quot;The Power of Now&quot; is a powerful tool for opening into the vastness &amp; peace of the &quot;Now&quot;.  In trying to apply his words by being aware of where my attention is, I have discovered how often my attention is in the past or future.  I also discovered that when I can live NOW, almost miraculous things have sometimes taken place in my life.  <br />Tolle tells us that since we have based our lives on what we have been taught, our cultural heritage, DNA &amp; how we have been treated, etc. everything we &quot;think&quot; possible is caged within the limited possibilities of that particular world which is based on our &quot;past&quot; experiences.  So we expect the &quot;future&quot; to grow out of the &quot;past&quot;.  Very limited!!  Therefore when you can be intensely present NOW, that world created by your mind drops away, &amp; what is left is infinite possibility!<br />I cannot recommend this book strongly enough, &amp; if you are more auditory than visual, buy the tapes of Tolle reading his own book.

In trying to apply his words by being aware of where my attention is, I have discovered how often my attention is in the past or future.  I also discovered that when I can live NOW, almost miraculous things have sometimes taken place in my life.  <br />Tolle tells us that since we have based our lives on what we have been taught, our cultural heritage, DNA &amp; how we have been treated, etc. everything we &quot;think&quot; possible is caged within the limited possibilities of that particular world which is based on our &quot;past&quot; experiences.  So we expect the &quot;future&quot; to grow out of the &quot;past&quot;.  Very limited!!  Therefore when you can be intensely present NOW, that world created by your mind drops away, &amp; what is left is infinite possibility!<br />I cannot recommend this book strongly enough, &amp; if you are more auditory than visual, buy the tapes of Tolle reading his own book.
0517123207|1.0|Regarding the complete lack of transitional forms in the fossil record, Darwin said in the 1850's:<br />&quot;Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.&quot; ---Charles Darwin, &quot;On the imperfection of the geological record&quot;, Chapter X, &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, J. M. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd, London, 1971, pp. 292-293.<br />But 120 years later!<br />&quot;Well, we are now about 120 years after Darwin and the knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly expanded. We now have a quarter of a million fossil species but the situation hasn't changed much. The record of evolution is still surprisingly jerky and, ironically, we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin's time. By this I mean that some of the classic cases of darwinian change in the fossil record, such as the evolution of the horse in North America, have had to be discarded or modified as a result of more detailed information -what appeared to be a nice simple progression when relatively few data were available now appears to be much more complex and much less gradualistic. So Darwin's problem has not been alleviated in the last 120 years and we still have a record which `does' show change but one that can hardly be looked upon as the most reasonable consequence of natural selection. Also the major extinctions such as those of the dinosaurs and trilobites are still very puzzling.&quot; ---Dr. David M. Raup (Curator of Geology, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago), &quot;Conflicts between Darwin and paleontology&quot;. &quot;Field Museum of Natural History Bulletin&quot;, vol. 50 (1), January 1979, p. 25.<br />Are there any transitional forms atall?<br />&quot;... I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutionary transitions in my book. If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them. You suggest that an artist should be used to visualize such transformations, but where would he get the information from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were to leave it to artistic license, would that not mislead the reader? <br />I wrote the text of my book four years ago. If I were to write it now, I think the book would be rather different. Gradualism is a concept I believe in, not just because of Darwin's authority, but because my understanding of genetics seems to demand it. Yet Gould and the American Museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitional fossils. As a palaeontologist myself, I am much occupied with the philosophical problems of identifying ancestral forms in the fossil record. You say that I should at least `show a photo of the fossil from which each type of organism was derived.' I will lay it on the line-there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.&quot;  ---Personal letter (written 10 April 1979) from Dr. Colin Patterson, Senior Palaeontologist at the British Museum of Natural History in London, to Luther D. Sunderland; as quoted in &quot;Darwin's Enigma&quot; by Luther D. Sunderland, Master Books, San Diego, USA, 1984, p. 89. <br />&quot;I know that, at least in paleoanthropology, data are still so sparse that theory heavily influences interpretations.  Theories have, in the past, clearly reflected our current ideologies instead of the actual data.&quot;   ---Dr. David Pilbeam (Physical Anthropologist, Yale University, USA), &quot;Rearranging our family tree&quot;. &quot;Human Nature&quot;, June 1978, p. 45.<br />&quot;The absence of fossil evidence for intermediary stages between major transitions in organic design, indeed our inability, even in our imagination, to construct functional intermediates in many cases, has been a persistent and nagging problem for gradualistic accounts of evolution.&quot;  ---Stephen Jay Gould (Professor of Geology and Paleontology, Harvard University), &quot;Is a new and general theory of evolution emerging?&quot; &quot;Paleobiology&quot;, vol. 6 (1), January 1980, p. 127.<br />&quot;The extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of paleontology. The evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches; the rest is inference, however reasonable, not the evidence of fossils. Yet Darwin was so wedded to gradualism that he wagered his entire theory on a denial of this literal record: <br />\\"The geological record is extremely imperfect and this fact will to a large extent explain why we do not find interminable varieties, connecting together all the extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps. He who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will rightly reject my whole theory.\\" <br />Darwin's argument still persists as the favored escape of most paleontologists from the embarrassment of a record that seems to show so little of evolution. In exposing its cultural and methodological roots, I wish in no way to impugn the potential validity of gradualism (for all general views have similar roots). I wish only to point out that it was never `seen' in the rocks. <br />Paleontologists have paid an exorbitant price for Darwin's argument. We fancy ourselves as the only true students of life's history, yet to preserve our favored account of evolution by natural selection we view our data as so bad that we never see the very process we profess to study.&quot;  ---Stephen Jay Gould (Professor of Geology and Paleontology, Harvard University), &quot;Evolution's erratic pace&quot;.  &quot;Natural History&quot;, vol. LXXXVI (5), May 1977, p. 14.<br />For truly eye-opening information...the kind you were never allowed to hear in high-school and university, see \\"Icons of Evolution\\" by Jonathan Wells, \\"Darwin's Black Box\\" by Michael Behe, \\"Bones of Contention\\" by Marvin Lubenow, \\"Evolution: A Theory in Crisis\\" by Michael Denton and \\"Evolution: The Fossils Still Say No!\\" by Duane Gish.

B000002GZ1|5.0|Rock/blues just doesn&#8217;t get any better than this. I only discovered Butterfield, Bloomfield et al. about a year ago, but I&#8217;ve been listening to this album ever since. How many times can one be amazed at just how great some music really is? Maybe Bloomfield&#8217;s guitar got a bit better with age (he was 22 when they made this album) - yes there is some awesome later stuff he made at the ripe age of 26 or so - but the incredibly wild youthful enthusiasm of the band couldn't be maintained. And in any case the combination of Bloomfield on guitar and Butterfield on harp  is so unbeatable it just takes your breath away. (The band broke up after the 2nd album, East/West, which was more &#8220;experimental&#8221;, rather than just doing what they did best). As one previous reviewer said: &#8220;hot and sweet&#8221;: that&#8217;s right on target - but it&#8217;s an understatement. No other electric music I know of combines the passion and skill of this work. This is the place to start for Butterfield, for Bloomfield, for electric blues in general, for rock....just buy this album!!
B00005BJ2O|1.0|I bought this CD in hopes of a decent musical romp...instead I was audibly assaulted by a rather hokey collection of so-called songs.  From Nicole Kidman's awful rendition of &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; to the laughable hodgepodge called &quot;The Elephant Love Medley&quot;, the &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; soundtrack is one hysterical musical!  How can one not laugh at the tango version of &quot;Roxanne&quot;?  The only saving grace is &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;.  Don't get me wrong, I love musicals and cheese...but not when it's done this bad.  Give me &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; any day.
B000059R8Y|5.0|This album has literally saved my life these past few months. I am going through a painful &amp; depressing divorce and this album has been the only thing that has brought me any joy. I never get tired of listening to it. I have not read the other reviews of this album to know what the general consensus is but I believe it to be a work of genius. This is by far the best album Clapton has released in many years (my own personal favorite since &quot;Money &amp; Cigarettes&quot; - a very underrated album)- an instant classic. Every note on this album is sheer perfection - from the wonderful opening instrumental (&quot;Reptile&quot;) to the sound of Clapton's guitar &amp; voice (check out his soulful version of &quot;Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight&quot;)to the background singing of the classic Impressions. There is alot of variety on this album - every song having its own sound &amp; style - yet every song works perfectly. There is not a wasted note.       It has been my pleasure turning other people onto this album - friends &amp; family alike. Everyone I have played this album for has loved it. It has blown them away, as it did me. I have loved Clapton throughout his career but I didn't realize he still had it in him in such a big way. I was pleasantly surprised. Never count out a genius.      I can relate to alot of the songs on this album as well. They certainly reflect the feelings I have had over the past few months. I feel like I could have written some of these words myself. Especially, &quot;Find Myself&quot; &amp; &quot;Got You on My Mind.&quot;      This album has probably been my best friend lately &amp; has helped me through the worst period in my life. I will probably look back on this time someday with not much fondness but I will always cherish &quot;Reptile.&quot; I recommend it to anyone out there who enjoys great songs &amp; terrific singing &amp; playing. This is what real soulful singing is all about - unlike most of what passes for &quot;soul&quot;music these days.      This album is a masterpiece.
B00000IPAX|1.0|Blink 182 actually used to be decent (Cheshire Cat) but has steadily gone downhill since then. A little while ago I had to take my sister clothes shopping at Limited Too and saw folders, pencils, and various other junk with Blink 182 all over it, right next to the 'Nsync posters and Backstreet Boys calanders. They have to be the biggest sell outs in all of music history. I am ashamed to say I own some of their cd's. While they never were exactly &quot;punk&quot;, they have slowly deteriorated into their current pathetic state of teenybopping, sick-humored (The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show...), trendy, highly overrated pop. I can only imagine what the &quot;music&quot; of the upcoming insult upon human ears-Take off Your Pants and Jacket- is going to sound like. We've already had our first preview with Rock Show. I pity the many souls who listen to and actually like this trash that has soiled the whole genre of punk-pop.
0790733226|4.0|Although the highly talented, and yes ~ very attractive ~ Matthew MacConaughy, sinks his teeth into the role of Palmer Joss, it is the very existence of this irritating character that dis-shelvels an otherwise 4 star classic. Time and space don't allow a comparative with the novel.......Dr. Arroway has little reason for faith. Her mother died giving birth to her, and her dad died nine years later. What is there left to believe in? Already science-minded, young Ellie Arroway looks to the stars for answers. An accomplished astro-physicist, she declines grants an fellowships to pursue a personal SETI. She falls victim to a series of hoaxes, ad evetually acquires a corporate sponsor in order to advance her agenda. Once she makes CONTACT, her career, and life, become entangled in bearu-theocracy. She copes well. An act of terrorism propels her again into the spotlight, and then into the Vega solar system. There she meets an alien who admittedly takes the form of her late father. She learns about time.  Once back on Earth, many are skeptical of her accounts. A lo-tech device offers proof of her testimony, but is shielded from the public. She continues...  This truly inspiring film suffers from the impossible combination of religion and science. Although Sagan himself talked the embracement of belief and science (he was a poitician too), the film makes it clear that these agendas cannot collide. Afterall, God is omnipotent. If God wants aliens, God'll have 'em. If the next minute God doesn't want aliens, there won't be none. Same goes for us. There is no common ground. For all its wisdom and insight, its lovely craft, its feel good message, it unfortunately fails as an intelligent film. That is, unless, we admit that peole are indeed illogical. Is that the point? We already know that.

B000001FFJ|1.0|Thank god this was a gift. A friend of mine gave me this album to introduce me to Tom Waits. I listened to it three times and I still don't get it. Yes, it's way out there, and that's enough for me to at least give it a chance. But there's almost no melody to speak of on most of the tracks, and Waits' voice is so deep and grating that sometimes you can't even tell what notes he's singing. What a joke. How did this guy get a recording contract? This album was absolutely painful to listen to.
6305807043|4.0|Everyone else who has reviewed this film has covered the plot, the acting and the directing of this film.  All I want to add is that I chuckled for days after seeing this film thinking about the craziness of the characters.  They were absolutely nuts, but very loveably nutty.  If you want something that will leave you in a good mood, see this.  It's a quality flick.
B00003W8NO|5.0|Man!  2 out of 2 ain't bad.  Toy Story was a great movie...and Toy Story 2 is just as good.  Rare.  Glad to see someone didn't buy into the notion that sequels have to be second rate to the first movie.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|First, let me say that I have read all the previous reviews and am happy almost all of the people have embraced this soundtrack as well as the film.  They are both truly amazing.  Even though I think you have to be a fan of musicals to be open to the experience of this film and its music, most of the problems seem to stem from those who bought the soundtrack first then saw the move, which is understandable since the soundtrack was released first.<br />  Since the movie is a musical and the songs are taken out of the context of the film, it is difficult to know how these songs relate to each other and to the story sight unseen.  I have experienced this before, buying cast recordings before having seen a production of whatever musical it happened to be.  This soundtrack is more like a cast recording, too, thankfully,  in that all the songs are in the same order as they are heard in the film, thereby helping you relive the story and experience.       The film had such atmosphere, and that atmosphere is recreated and represented well in the selection of songs included on the soundtrack.<br />P.S.  I saw the movie last night (loved it!) and will probably see it again at least once.  I will be listening to the soundtrack over and over for a while.  Now, I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the DVD!!!
B00003CX7L|5.0|Love the story, love the characters, love the action.  The computer animation is unbelievable.  The soundtrack isn't so bac either.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Gilbert, Sullivan and Andrew Lloyd Weber drop acid, watch Rocky Horror Picture Show, then write the screenplay for Moulin Rouge.<br />A frantic explosion of color, action, song, and dance blends, inexorably, into a tense story of love steeped in obsessive jealousy all of which can be stopped by death.  I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I found myself laughing on the edge of my seat.  Nicole and Ewan are terrific and are surrounded by an amazing and enchanting cast of characters.
B000059HCI|5.0|the content of the movie isnt the point. its about the lives of 4 people and their struggles with the drug scene. but the trageties could really happen. the acting is wonderful. the camera shots are beautiful. i love the scene when we first see jennifer connely. she is looking up at a tall building, and there is green grass behind her. and jared leto comes up behind her and embraces her. its so beautiful. if you appreciate things like this, you will like this movie. i had to watch it twice because i wanted to see it again. if you're a teenager you might not want to watch it with your parents. unless they're cool.
B000056JYB|5.0|the 1st cd has some real gems on it...the original 6 songs sound great..but  the gems are the new  ones...and  the  2nd  cd is full of  jams..!!  this  cd is a must for any serious collector ..it really shows  how  well stevie  and  eric  worked together...and  gingers drummin`  is  classic...solid...its amazing  that this band didn't stay together longer.but  this cd sure is sweet!!
0792842723|5.0|GOLDENEYE is definitely the best Bronsan Bond film (much better than TOMMOROW NEVER DIES and THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH!) so far. It's also the best Bond outing since FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. It's got everything a good Bond movie needs: A good Bond, a good Bond girl, a good villain, good action scenes, and a good plot/story.
B000002O7C|5.0|The Hunt For The Red October is a masterpiece for Poledouris.  It is an excellent blend of chorus, electronics, and orchestra.  Unlike Zimmer's pumped up score to Crimson Tide, Poledouris relies less on bass-pounding masculine beats amd more reasonable effectice scoring.  The use of light electronic effects in the score easily convey the massive ocean depths and the occassional outburst of the chorus adds to the beauty of the ocean seascape.  Where the two scores compete in themes, Hunt For The Red October wins.  While both effectively portray the submarine, Poledouris's use of a male Russian choir singing Russian lyrics is powerful and brings out the spirit of the sailors better than Crimson Tide's wordless chorus.  The appearance of the bold theme when the captain decides to go down with the submarine is moving and gripping.  Red Route I is a fantastic, yet vaguely haunting, portrayal of the deep depths.  It has the kind of feministic, delicate orchestral beauty that Crimson Tide rarely comes close to.  The battle music at the end breaks away from the traditional orchestral concept and goes almost entirely electronic, like the track Chopper.  It is wrenching and suspenseful and definately comes the closest to Crimson Tide.  While the all the tracks are great, the album definately lacks enough music.  With only 30 minutes, much is left to be desired (I've seen the bootleg release and recommend it, too).  This is nothing bad for the main theme alone is worth the purchase.  An instant classic and success for Poledouris.
0783225970|5.0|What to say about what I consider to be one of the best performances on screen of all time. Now you wonder, am I qualified to say that? Has he only seen Charlie's Angels and other such neo-trash waste of film? Believe me I have a history in film and I can honestly say that Pacino's tour de force performance is amazingly powerful and real. Kind of a Michael Corleone on crack (or cocaine as the case may be) While bloody and not pretty at times is an amazing film that everyone should see at least once.  Word of warning, hide the kids,...
B00005ASOC|5.0|I'm not a film analyst, and I won't pretend to be.  I wasn't sure I would like this film, based on the reviews, which were favorable.  That's because I didn't know whether I could trust them.<br />I suspected that reviewers may have had an axe to grind, one way or another.  Sean Connery will always get good reviews for even a fair performance, his fans are that loyal.  Fortunately, he doesn't mail too many performances in, so he usually satisfies in any case.  Then, there is heavy black/African American content in this movie, and that can bring out higher or lower ratings, based on political or racial considerations, rather than the merits of the film.<br />Sean Connery's performance, to me, was indeed outstanding.  His best?  I save that title for The Man Who Would Be King, but this one is right up there.  Rob Brown, in his first effort, was actually pretty good for a newcomer.  If you notice the acting, the actor screwed up.  I didn't notice it, so he must have done a good job.  It might well have been a veteran actor.<br />Jamal's family is presented as typically semi-functional for a black neighborhood in a major American city (it looked like the Bronx to me, but it's been a long time since I've been there).  His father is gone, mother is great, his brother has an honest but low paying job.  Oddly, the one thing I noticed about the neighborhood is the almost total absence of crime, gangs, and drugs.  That's almost total, since the only crime I saw take place was when Jamal broke into Forrester's apartment, and even that wasn't motivated by thievery.  Rather it was curiosity, and he did it on a dare, like a bunch of scared kids outside a haunted house.  For the writer and director to leave out the challenge of crime in that neighborhood must have been an intentional choice.  Perhaps they felt Jamal already had enough challenges, and I can't fault that logic.<br />Forrester, of course, is being compared to writer J.D. Salinger.  A fine writer who did one novel, and some magazine pieces, and was pretty much a recluse for reasons known only to him.  There is another man he might be likened to, and that is radio personality, writer, and actor Jean Shepherd, who died almost two years ago on Sanibel Island, Florida.  Details are different, but I sure recognize the attitude.  Both men were damned hard to really know, and each had his own means of hiding out from admirers.<br />If there were one loose end, one might point to the fact that Forrester offered no apology to some one he deeply wronged, when he could have.  It might well have been in character for him not to, though.<br />I won't give away anything about the ending, except to say that final scene was an eye opener, and things look really interesting for Jamal.<br />Finding Forrester didn't get very much publicity.  I think it deserved to have more.  It is a fine film.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Wonderful,..Kevin Spacey is amazing,...while a few people didnt like it I must say that this is amongst his best performances ever,...and I have seen the Usual Suspects,....
B000002BE9|5.0|If it can, then Fiona's first CD will.  Her voice is BEAUTIFUL, absolutely beautiful.  The voice of a summer sultry night, the voice of eyes that have seen too much for such a young age.  She will beckon your soul to take flight.  Anyone who can use the word &quot;undulate&quot; in a song without making it sound out of place has a knack for songwriting.  She is lyrically honest and articulate, and her voice seems to control the emotions she describes.  If the only song you've ever heard of hers is &quot;Criminal,&quot; then you are truly missing out.  She is inspiring and will give voice to the range of feelings that you can't put words to.  Truly brilliant, an introspective view into Fiona and yourself.
B00000IPAX|4.0|I have to say these guys are hot!!!  But besides that, this C.D. is super cool.  The songs are great and you can relate to some of the songs.  I highly recommend this Blink C.D.!

B000001FKY|5.0|Def Leppard's best album in my opinion [and I own them all] Tracks like Rocket, Animal, Love Bites, Armageddon It, Pour Some Sugar on Me, Gods of War are all rock classics.  You've then got your fun songs like Exciteable which helps carry the album along well and the last song Love and Affection has to be one of the best soft rock closing tracks ever.  Buy this now!  A masterpiece.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I just saw Moulin Rouge yesterday, and after anticipating it for weeks, it went beyond my expectations.  It's loaded with humor and great music.<br />My favorites are:&quot;Because we can&quot; which is exciting, full of action, and hyper--makes you want to dance.   &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; is a combo of TEN songs, from Joh Lennon's &quot;All You need is love&quot; to &quot;I will always love you.&quot;  I love the climax with &quot;I will always love you&quot; and the opera singer harmonizing in the back.  Very passionate. &quot;Come What May&quot; also has that passion, but it's the main love song.  It starts off with Ewan singing kinda softly (he has a great voice) and Kidman joins, and then it builds. &quot;El Tango de Roxanne&quot; has the pimp singing in his really low, hoarse, rumbling voice, which really goes well with Ewan's smoother, higher harmony when they sing together towards the end. &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot; is the other heart-pumping, fast-paced, makes-you-wanna dance song, and like its name suggests, it has an Indian influence in its techno-like sound.<br />The other songs are fine, &quot;Nature Boy&quot; has a nice moodiness, but I didn't think the remix at the end was that great or that different from the first track.   &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; is SO OVER-PLAYED on the radios!  Personally, I never liked the original song, so basically, I don't care for the melody.  The only reason I like to listen to it is because of all the fancy vocalizations.  Is it just me or does Aguilera seem like she's trying to dominate the whole song?  Yes, she has a more loud, powerful, higher vocal range, but at the end, when they name each singer and each singer does a little solo, why, for example does Pink just get &quot;uh uh uh&quot; like grunting?  But the variety of vocal styles work together.<br />&quot;Complainte de la butte&quot; is a cute little French croon.  &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot; is entertaining.  &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; is fine.I don't care much for &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; and &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot; (for some reason, the latter, whenever I hear it, I kept help but hear Gloria Estefan singing it, which ruins the experience...if you don't hear it, it's a good song then...unless of course, you like Estefan).<br />Both Ewan and Kidman have their own solo songs, Ewan's &quot;Your Song&quot; is strong.  His voice carries it very well.  Kidman's &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot; is a bit weaker, not because of her voice, but the melody itself...whenever she does the chorus, &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot; and the line after that...it doesn't sound right, because it strongly reminds me of a melody that started out the same way but afterwards, different.<br />Overall, I like all the songs, meaning, I could listen to the CD from beginning to end without skipping tracks.  The only major thing that I'm disappointed in is that it's missing songs like &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; with the Duke and the pimp singing it (really really funny scene!), &quot;The hills are alive with music&quot; with dialogue, and the song when the Bohemians, Christian, Satine, and the pimp are promoting &quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot; to the Duke.
B000056ULS|5.0|Since I was already familiar with the songs on this album, I was mostly interested in the videos. Contrary to what has been previously written, the videos are *not* in DVD format. This is a simple enhanced CD, with multimedia and video tracks in QuickTime format. They worked fine as-is on my stock Mac CD-ROM drive. QuickTime is even included on the CD for installation if you need it.<br />The videos can be played directly from the CD, or viewed in a *very nice* multimedia application. Unfortunately, the version of the video for &quot;Here With Me&quot; is the same as on the actual DVD release. I was hoping for the earlier black and white video which I like much more. I had never seen the video for &quot;Thank You&quot;, but it's clever and I enjoyed it immensely. The videos are presented at a decent size, but suffer at points from compression artifacts and a rather slow frame rate. Certainly not enough to ruin them, but distracting at times.<br />There is also a gallery of nice, if somewhat small, photos that can be viewed within the application.<br />The &quot;bonus song&quot; is the same as on the regular US release.<br />For me, the novelty of the enhanced CD was worth the price. The music may be the same, but if you don't have a DVD player this is a neat way to get a copy of her videos at a reasonable price.
B000005J56|5.0|I have not listened to an album over and over like this one in many years.  My husband and I never grow bored of this cd.  A true pleasure to listen to.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I love this movie and I always will. This film has always helped me cheer up and it also helps me appreciate my life and friendships I have. It also tell me how people ,young or old, can grow so quickly and how much we all need friends to help us muddle through the bad times. This story shows Samantha (Gaby Hoffman and Demi Moore) trying to cope with her parents getting a divorce and how ,even in movies, it is hard to do that. I would say that my favourite character in 'Now and Then' is Roberta (Christina Ricci and Rosie O'Donnell) as she reminds me of myself because she doesn't care about getting dirty and how she sticks up for herself but also as she needs her friends as much as anyone else does. I like all of the characters because they all have such different personalities and that is why I love this film so much.
6305176299|5.0|This is one crazy ride that grabs on and never lets go.  The plot is innovative, the action is exhilerating, and the characters are likable.  I liked this movie because it didn't focus only on insane action.  The characters were made important and ultimately human.  They display emotions such as fear and disbelief that would be expected in a situation such as the one being faced.  Keanu Reeves plays Jack Traven, an LAPD police officer with alot of guts who along with his partner Harry Temple, played by Jeff Daniels, must stop a crazy, retired Atlanta cop who is bent on earning his pension by holding a bus load of people hostage.  The bus is wired with a bomb, set to explode if the speed drops below 50 MPH.  Dennis Hopper plays a wonderfully insane Howard Payne who holds the police hostage as well, as there is nothing they can do to get the people off the bus of defuse the bomb, as it is under the bus.  The action will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end.
B000059ZLH|4.0|The main feature on this DVD - the full-length performance of &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2&quot; - isn't flawless.  The performances of the extra actors border on the laughable, and Mike Portnoy overdirected a bit. He heaped on digital video effect after digital video effect to the point where it interfered with my enjoyment of the performance, and also exhibits an odd late-1960's aesthetic sense that manifests itself in weird effects like superimposing the band's name over a shot.  Overall, though, those amount to minor flaws.  Musically, the performance itself is simply fantastic, the energy level high and James LaBrie (whose reputation as a live performer is justifiably dodgy) in absolutely top form.  As much as the studio version moved me nearly to tears, this live verson sent palpable shivers down my spine.  The additional materials are likewise excellent.  The band's audio commentary is worth the price of the DVD all by itself, and the full hour of bonus live tracks (refreshingly free of strobing, splits, superimposition and other &quot;Videodelic&quot; effects) were utterly prime Dream Theater.  Having never had the chance to see this band, one of my favorites, live, this DVD made me a very happy fan.
0140434089|4.0|I surprised was discover how good this &quot;sensation novel&quot; still is. The characters are treated with deep interest and affection by the author, and the plot is, of course, a classic in the field. Collin's leisurely Victorian style is a welcome change from the usual contemporary &quot;buy it at the grocery store&quot; bloody thriller.
B00005JIZA|5.0|John Mayer is one the best live performers or performers/singer/songwriters of the new millenium. John is a solid play in any digital audio player. I had the priviledge to see him perform live in February in Philadelphia. John opened for Glen Philips of the now defucnt band called Toad the Wet Sprocket. I was amazed by the talent John portrayed song after song after song. John and his guitar lit up the stage with total and maximum velocity which ignited a flame in all of us who attended the show. His acoustic clips are so very powerful. He is a one man show. His latest cd &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is a perfect combination of classical John Mayer interspersed with sounds reminiscent of DMB. John is not Dave Matthews. Dave Mathhews is not John Mayer. The two are very different. I prefer John's music over Dave's. Sorry Dave. John provides variety in each and every tune he plays out. The new album gives john the added punch he so desires. With the addition of instruments to the mix, the music is real John Mayer. The John Mayer we all deserve. Oh, btw my cd was signed by the man himself. The first 2000 copies sold by Aware were signed. I really enjoyed &quot;St Patrick's Day&quot;, &quot;Love song for no one&quot; and of course the soulful-sexy &quot;Your body is a wonderland&quot; What are you waiting for? Go purchase it!
B0000025P9|5.0|Although this is a darn fine album, sadly it's all some people know about Toto. Don't get me wrong, this is as great a place to start with Toto as any, but it shouldn't end here. &quot;Rosanna&quot;, &quot;Africa&quot;, and &quot;I Won't Hold You Back&quot; were one time radio staples, and deservedly so, but there are songs here that would belong on a Toto fan's greatest hits album including &quot;Make Believe&quot;, &quot;We Made It&quot;, and &quot;Waiting for Your Love&quot;. Buy Toto IV without delay but also check out &quot;Isolation&quot;, &quot;Mindfields&quot; and &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot;.
0131103628|5.0|Out of all the books I have read...this one deserves 6 stars!  I picked up several books on C at the local library in an attempt to learn the language.  After reading several books that made &quot;War and Peace&quot; seem small, I picked this one up from the stack.  In a little over 200 pages, the authors ahd explained C in a way that all the others failed.  They approach C from a no-nonsense way and explain it in simple, easy to understand language.  I have sense purchased my own copy, and I noticed that every coder at work has this book readily at hand.  <br />Other books tend to miss the mark when it comes to C, and some of them won't even attempt to explain pointers, arrays and structures.  One book I had refered me to this book for a better explaination!  These guys invented C, so its the best thing short of having them as a personal teacher!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I watched it on its premier day.  It was exhilarating!  Although I have to say that it was also kind of weird in some places...but I enjoyed it a lot.  Since I got the soundtrack already, I got to know where the songs fit, and I found the songs very nice and fit the scenes.  Ewan McGregor really can sing!  Honestly, maybe you won't want to watch it again, but I STRONGLY recommand you to watch it at least once!  It was very funny, too.  People laughed very loud in the theater.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I decided to buy this album after watching the the video to the single sonne on my kerrang video and all i can say is wow. Listening to this album made me regret not fetting into them sooner and i make it my mission to buy the rest of their albums as soon as i can. Well on to the actual album. This album blew me away from the first song seemingly starting slow but then accelerating into a great chorus with the violins ripped straight out of puff daddys \\"come with me\\" single with the german lyrics providing a suitable atmosphere to the mournful violins in the verse (if you thinks that sounds good imagine what the rest of the album is like............). There is so much more to say on this album but i dont have all day to go through its many virtues so ill try to sum them up for you. This album is a refrshingly original blend of electronic, orchestral and choral sounds with both harsh and melodic lyrics, ripping industrial guitars all blended togeather in a perfect mix. If this sounds like your cup of tea buy this album now you wont regret it.
B0000028MA|5.0|In my former years growing up, I got a feeling from grunge and Seattle that so far, hasn't been replaced. I was young when this came out, I was hopelessly searching for something exciting, I had my Soundgarden, my Nirvana, my Pearl Jam, my Mother Love Bone, but I needed something else. A small sign in the compilations section said &quot;Singles&quot; as I stumbled toward the white sign with the black letters. Smashing...and then Pumpkins caught my retina, thus triggering my brain to order the slave hand to pick the plastic up. A startling, confusing, cover adorned the front of the case, and I was intrigued. I bought it. I liked it a lot. Looking back on it, it's really a nostalgic reminder of the early 90s Seattle, of my frustrating teenage years, and something great. The Pumpkins drill out an epic as the closer, while Chris Cornell and Pearl Jam fill in with great tunes as well. I miss the early 90s. I miss them a lot.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I am a long time fan. This album is a return to classic Depeche mode. Very nice.<br />-DMS
B000002HRE|3.0|Basically, ReLoad is not a bad album, but far from being a good album as well. It doesn't sound like metal as Metallica's trademark fast pace has really slowed down, and the famous blistering guitar solos are almost gone, but there are still a few relatively shiny moments on this. The good news is that the bad songs are not too bad. In short most songs sound similar and boring.<br />There is absolutely no reason to buy this album: If you're into hard rock there are certainly better albums (get all Gn'R albums before you touch this). If you're a metal headbanger it would be a very pathetic joke to buy this album as there are so many great metal albums out there, just try anything by Iron Maiden, Iced Earth or Judas Priest.. compared to albums by those bands, this album seems like a(nother) very sad episode of Metallica.<br />If you're a diehard Metallica fan however I guess you should have this, and it's not that bad afterall.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Stunning sets,flashy and dazzling costumes,and the best performances make this movie a winner.The chemisrty between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is electrifying,when they sing you feel the magic.The songs and dances are performed spectacularly and the movie is a hit.
0792101448|5.0|Director Sergio Leone's crowning achievement and arguably one of the greatest movies of all time regardless of genre.  The movie takes its sweet time weaving an engaging yarn with strong characters and a haunting musical score that is itself a work of art. This is some of composer Ennio Morricone's finest work ever.  Name your cinematic yardstick, and this movie excels at it.  How ironic that it took an Italian to create the greatest American western ever.
B000002UB6|3.0|Since its release in 1970, Let it Be has been criticized. During the recording of the white album, the Beatles were acting like less of a band. Although few deny the album's excellence, songs for the white album was recorded with some band members not even attending when someone else's song was being recorded. Trying to get back (pardon the pun) to the feeling of old days, the boys sat down and just jammed. Unable to agree on how to handle any aspect of their collective career, the band eventually shelved the tapes and when it was certain there would be no more Beatles albums in the future, it was decided the sessions would be of some worth. Phil Spector was called in and that's where, according to many, the trouble started. Spector overdubbed unneeded orchestras, choirs and other syrupy aspects to the improvisional sessions. The Beatles were unhappy with the results and so were many fans.  I agree completely that Spector's production to completely meddling. Although, the strings and choir add a little bit to the Long and Winding Road, they are uncalled for on the two-minute I Me Mine and the mellow Across the Universe. They make the songs sound pretentious and are downright irritating.  But that does not mean the album is a waste. The improvisional spirit shines through, despite Spector, on the rockabilly One After 909 and Get Back, made famous by Ringo's final, \\"I hope we passed the audition.\\" Two of Us and Dig a Pony are the two sweetest pop songs of the Beatles' post-Beatlemania period. Harrison's high-spirited I've Got a Feeling is another sign there was a great songwriter who sadly did not get the attention he deserved throughout the Beatles's years. While McCarthy's Let It Be and Lennon's Across the Universe are two of the Beatles' most poignant songs and even with the annoying strings and choirs added, they still shine.  After years of debate about David Bowie's production softening the Stooge's final album, Raw Power, a version of the unmixed tapes, Rough Power, was released. Perhaps the Beatles' should release something similar with Let It Be, because despite meddling production, no one can deny these are great songs, often mixing the charm of the early Beatles with the adventurous sense of the latter Beatles.
030716327X|5.0|When my daughter was a little girl, I used to read Pat the Bunny to her every night.  She learned to interact and role play using this tool.  Recently my daughter had her first child and my first gift to my grandson was a copy of Pat the Bunny.
B000002NJS|5.0|Possibly Madonna's best album to date, Madonna reaches a new level of maturity with ray of light.  The best songs are power of goodbye and ray of light.  Madonna has always set the standard for pop and with this album she raises the bar.
B00005BL2A|1.0|All I can say about this release is that the songs are boring.  Elaborate studio production doesn't compensate for boring material.  There aren't any memorable songs.  This CD sounds like a bunch of filler material.  I wish that Napster was back to its former glory so that I can listen to this stuff before  I spend my hard earned $$$ on this (yawn) dust collector.  The title Exciter is definitely a misnomer.
B000002GEY|4.0|It's pretty good, but, not their best. If you want to hear Supertramp at their best, try &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments&quot;, &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; and &quot;Crises, What Crises?&quot; I love those 3 albums so much that I can't pick a favorite. They are all equally excellent!!!
0792839749|1.0|Whoever was behind the marketing strategy of the DVD version of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was frightfully short sighted and just plain stupid.  If you are a collector and like musicals and want this movie in letterboxed format, forget it.  MGM has decided, \\"too bad, you don't get to have this one letterboxed.\\"  Here's what I suspect MGM's myopic, warped logic is: \\"this is a movie for children and children just won't be able to handle those black bars on the TV screen - this just wouldn't be 'family friendly'. \\"  What a bunch of..., and what a regressive attitude on the part of MGM in an age of big screen TVs including the rising popularity of widescreen television.  Not to mention us collectors out of luck who want to have a copy of the film with it's integrity intact!  No!  We have no choice in the case of this title.  We have to put up with the horrific pan and scan transfer.  No thank you!  There's no logical reason why MGM couldn't offer an alternate widescreen transfer of this movie on DVD.  Hell, even Disney releases it's titles letterboxed!  This whole marketing strategy of the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang on DVD is so reactionary it makes me sick to my stomach.  I won't recommend this ugly pan and scan transfer to anyone.  Even my young children are upset that the DVD is not letterboxed!...
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen is often considered the comic book series which brought literary elements such as symbolism, heavy characterization and a basis drawn as much from the author's imagination as the last decade's issues of Time to what is thought as a kid's genre. I have not read comics since I was a kid and I loved the gritty series. Masked vigilantes have guarded high crime areas since the 1930s. Banned in 1977, they withered away or submitted to government supervision with the exception of the violent terror of the underworld, the outlawed Rorschach. It is 1985, the Comedian has been thrown from a building, nuclear superman Dr. Manhattan has been publicly disgraced inspiringm him to leave the planet, Ozzymandias has been shot at and only Rorschach sees an important pattern. But the main plot is just a vehicle to link the individual, flashback filled portrayals of masked heroes in the real world. They interact with actual occurrences as the notorious murder of Kitty Genovese inspired Rorschach to leave his menial job for vigilantism and the appearance of Dr. Manhattan put America in the lead of its nuclear arms race against Russia. They do not always do what is right as the madness of Vietnam inspired the Comedian to gun down a pregnant woman and anyone whose political believes include due process and anti-capital punishment sentiments despises the infamous Rorschach. They symbolize different things as the crime fighter, Ozzymandias turned philanthropist and renaissance man, Adrian Veidt spews Peale-style philosophy and the cold, withdrawn, omnipotent Dr. Manhattan considers if he is to help mankind of loom over it, symbolizing science in the nuclear age. I enjoyed the sharp differences between the characters' philosophies despite being compelled to do the same strange thing for the same goals. Rorschach beats a lowlife criminal timid, thinking \\"New York is dying of rabies. All I can do is wipe random flakes of foam from its lips.\\" Veidt, in turn quit crime fighting becausecrime is \\"a symptom of the overall sickness of the human spirit. I don't believe you can cure a disease by suppressing its symptoms.\\" Moore's sharp writing and ability to create atmosphere are at best as strong personalities filled with underlining clash. In one scene Veidt, the world's strongest Maslow-believer is turned against Dr. Manhattan, \\"the walking H-bomb.\\" \\"I've walked across the sun. I've seen events so small they can barely se said to have occurred at all but you are a man and the world's smartest man means nothing more to me than the world's smartest termite,\\" Manhattan sneers. It is confrontations like this that make this one of Moore's many masterpieces. The book features personalities and circumstance as colorful as the names and costumes of its characters.
B00003CXMG|1.0|What an overrated movie! The characters lack any semblance of depth, the script lacks anything that it was purported to have and the story is so poor it makes me sick. This took me 3 days to get through, it's a dud. [...]
B00005B36H|4.0|I'd heard of Tool, but not heard Tool before I got this immense album. Now I think I know what the fuss was about. This album is immense. Its sound is clear, crisp, crunchy. Its music is intelligent, emotional, scary and comforting. Ive not heard a record with such intensity for some time, which is an achievement considering the length of the tracks. Although its hard to listen to in one sitting, certain songs really stick out. The Grudge is amazing, a real cry of rage, as is Ticks and Leeches, which is is angry, intense, then drifts away into some dreamscape netherworld, then returns in an inferno of noise and Maynards stunning growl. What a series of voices that man has, and how unlike so many (nu) metal bands are his intelligent but not off-putting lyrics. Throughout this album is a sense of looming cosmic dread, punctuated by glaring bursts of melodic anger. Its my album of the year so far.
6304057709|5.0|Rarely does a film like &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; come along, with that perfect balance of drama, humor, and romance, the sort that leaves you simply feeling happy as the final credits roll. I hated to see it end, in fact; I could have gone on watching the marvelous cast much longer, and that's saying something. Based on the Jane Austen novel (and deftly adapted by Emma Thompson), the plot is uncomplicated, but never tedious or boring. We can thank a terrific cast for that. Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet shine as the Dashwood sisters, Hugh Grant quietly charms, and the supporting cast adds depth and, in some cases, hilarity.<br />Director Ang Lee has quite a wide and accomplished repetoire (&quot;The Ice Storm&quot;, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;), yet I would not hesitate in listing this film among his best. His accomplishments with this thoroughly British film are even more considerable since he is Asian. He paces the film fluidly, giving each actor multiple chances to shine, and quite competently balancing the mix of comedy and drama.<br />&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is the perfect movie if you are in the mood for something funny and heart-warming. Essential for any Emma Thompson fan.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge portrays a classic love story of two people who fall in love and learned that the best things you learn in life is &quot;to love and be loved in return.&quot; The songs of this movie sounds like the soundtrack of the earlier Disney hits like Beauty and The Beast and The Little Mermaid. It is well writen and lifts up the atmosphere of love for this movie. Watch this if you want to get inspired by true love.
B00004XOWM|3.0|I can't give this one star. I can't give this 2 stars. THIS DOES NOT DESERVE 5 STARS EITHER (OR 4)! So, the only thing left to give it is 3. &quot;My Generation&quot; will be one of my favorite songs, but this doesn't really match the rest of the stuff I'm into, another example being Iron Maiden, the old stuff. I am way more into bands like Pantera and Sepultura. There are some songs on here I really don't care for, and then some okay songs (My Generation).
B000056VIY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I first heard the tracks on J.Lo On The 6 had mostly slow ballads about love while this time around there are only a few slow ballads that I simply love. There are spanish tracks, R&amp;B tracks, Techno Tracks.. everything! I also think that many of the songs on J.Lo were about Puffy. Jennifer co-wrote some of the songs and you can really tell that they were having some problems. Anyway, It's a good party album and here are a review of some of the songs--<br />1) Love Don't Cost A Thing: Good song with a good beat. The video was also great and most of you probably know it already. The single went to number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100.<br />2) I'm Real: The beginning starts off peaceful and slow and then it progresses into a good beat. One of the songs I believe were for Puffy... or P.DIDDY. P.Diddy is on the track saying &quot;She's a bad bad bi***&quot; good song<br />3) Play: Her current single which is hot! The beginning is hot and it's one of the techo-ish songs on the album. Lyrics are simple, but good club song.<br />4) Walking oN Sunsine: I love this song! It's one of my favorites. Jennifer's voice actually songs pretty good and the beat is nice but slow. It will have you singing along! Probably one of her future singles. <br />5) Ain't It Funny: Jennifer wrote this song and is going to be her next single. I believe that this song was meant for her current boyfriend Chris Judd, which is one of her dancers. It's got a latin beat to it and it's a good song.<br />9) That's not me: has a dramatic beginning to it and it stays that way. Very good song and will have you singing along to it in no time.<br />11) Secretly: One of the slow songs on the album. It's one of my fave songs because it's exactly what I'm going through right now. SHe also sings it very well! <br />13) That's the way: I like this song! The intrusments sound very funky and will also probably be a future single.<br />Well, I do reccommend that you buy this album. It's got a lot of dancing tracks and the few slow songs on the album are actually good. It's good to see that she can craft herself a good album and act just as well.
630463949X|1.0|I bought, for the 1st time in my life, two DVD musicals &quot;Hell Freezes Over, Eagles&quot; and this one.  I love FM but this DVD is soooooo disappointing, I was considering return it --- the video is dull and the audio is simply unprofessional and unforgivable !!<br />I rate the Eagles' DVD 100 stars !!!! go get that one.......
B00000K2SC|3.0|This movie delivers as a sci-fi, action, movie. It is very entertaining. Though Keanu Reeves acting suffers badly. This movie is worth renting but not buying.
B000000OSE|4.0|I own both &quot;Use Your Illusion I and II&quot; and UYI 1 is definately the better of the two.  Illusion I shows just how hard GnR can rock, while Illusion II focuses more on suicide and the darker side of life.  If youre a GnR fan this is a must own.  If you like this then youll definately love their debut release &quot;Appetite for Destruction.&quot;
078322687X|3.0|There are plenty of reviews here about the movie, so there is no sense in writing another.<br />This review is about the DVD. I will tell you up front that this DVD looks like a direct copy off VHS. I have seen the VHS version about 2 times this year and when the title song comes on, the audio fades in and out. Not bad, but you can definitely see some age in it. The DVD is EXACTLY the same. The sound is of no higher quality.<br />There is no widescreen, just a full screen with the same picture quality as VHS. It's not horrible, but if you are the type of person who buys DVDs for the superior picture quality, you are definitely going to be unhappy with this.<br />The movie itself is EXCELLENT, I love it, but the DVD transfer from VHS isn't the best.<br />As for bonus features, you get bios for all of the actors. The trouble is, the information included is the same as you can find on the internet movie database (imdb) as well as fan sites. If you have read a fair amount on any of the actors and know their biography fairly well, this DVD offers nothing new.<br />There are also some brief production notes about where and how this movie was done, and some quotes from the cast and crew.<br />Again, if you have done any research online and gone to any fan sites or even a site dedicated to John Hughes, you will find nothing new here. No interviews, a little behind the scenes, some background detail, but in the big picture, not much else.<br />Just a forewarning.<br />I bought the DVD because unlike VHS tapes, a DVD CD doesn't wear out. But if you watch the VHS version, then the DVD, the quality is the same. DVD is not any better.<br />So overall, EXCELLENT movie, but not a great transfer. Still, if you are a fan, definitely add it to your collection, but if you buy DVDs for the extras, you will be very disappointed with this.
