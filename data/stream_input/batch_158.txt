B00KWGAHS2|5|Great quality and price!
B000C2UIQC|5|good
B000VKOD9S|4|Fit into place perfectly.
B00KTHZ8CY|3|This worked fine for us because we could remove our key until from the old case and put it into this new case but if someone is planning to utilize the &#34;key&#34; that comes in this new case they will have to send it away to be made into a key that works for their particular car.
B004C44466|5|Awesome, amazing jacket. Makes me wish we had cooler weather here year round.
B000CKGAV6|5|Wonderful product and wonderful service.
B0002JMF98|4|Met my requirements just fine
B00LSTPN7M|5|Its nice and it works.
B0002SR6XO|5|Exactly what I needed for new travel trailer running gear. Fast delivery, good price
B000CSC5MG|5|exactly what my mechanic needed to fix my car, nothing more nothing less.  Nice job with having a good product that works well and arrives in a reasonable amount of time.
B00MES4C5K|5|Looks so much better
B010DP8PIU|5|[[VIDEOID:4cbe148043909470c569e384293e7cf3]] So this battery bank rocks<br />This is like a First Aid Kit for my car<br />This is better than asking stranger to jump the car<br />with 2 power IQ port it is wonderful to charge your phone at the same time<br />the flashlight was really bright. it felt like 5 W LED or equivilant to 40 Watt CFL<br />i have 1.6L engine and i am ready for the battery to be drained<br />I dont have to worry now about the battery level because anker got me covered<br />I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest<br />HD- http://youtu.be/k_k68p8T-q8
B00LATB2IE|4|Two stage bulb works good. Running light intensity same as incandescent bulb, stop light about 85% of the halogen it replaces. Not a bad trade off for a faster lighting bulb and lower current draw.
B00KWMG4A6|5|yes nice
B001REYVJE|5|We use this product a lot and pass up the price
B00KSUA6HY|5|These are very bright.  Be aware you will probably have to dim them down to the point where your other dash lights not in the instrument cluster may be too dim after lowering the output on these crazy bright bulbs.
B004W4OFTC|5|super nice upgrade
B000KDZJL2|5|The headset works as promised.  Have used it on several trips and it worked flawlessly.
B001A3KPYM|5|Works as I expected
B004NV1DIU|5|good job
B003FO71X2|5|Everything was great
B00TI9OFFU|2|Not The correct size , but there was no larger size the material is of good quality up to this point (1 1/2 months).
B005PZMKZI|3|Be sides the bench seat covers being difficult to install everything else was great.
B001GG2EUG|5|Perfect.
B00YYIVH2Y|1|Did not come close to fitting a small SUV.  To cheap to bother sending back
B003CJL0Z0|5|As described!
B000B5QFE4|5|These mirrors are awesome.  They have very little vibration when towing.
B005OY83LK|5|Was looking far a pin strip so I ended up ordering this kit and cutting my own. It looks awesome with a straight edge and a little patients!<br /><br />For anyone wondering this is a 2 piece set so one for each side of the truck of the same measurement.
B00HLK77YO|5|Love this tail gate lock.  Well designed, well made and very easy to install.
B006VU36WC|1|My car has pretty nasty water spots. Ive tried vinegar and lemon and it didnt do anything. I decided to try an abbrasive product so I bought this and ,not surprisingly, it didnt do anything either. I used a lot of elbow grease using a microfiber towel as instructed  and there is absolutely no progress. I continued and used almost half the bottle and still nothing. Maybe ot works with a polisher but I believe its just not abbrasive enough. Dont bother buying this product.
B00YT1IGTS|5|GREAT
B000DT7W2W|5|Easy to put on.and is a lot louder than the stock horn.
B000C5WCUE|1|u get what u pay for
B00068XCQU|5|They make very nice products. Easy to use and reliable.
B003L8WUBU|5|Very compact and sturdy, love it!
B00OZVNFW0|5|Awsome, fit perfect and great price
B0053SKJAK|4|It works if you don't plan on using indoors as part of a rain collection system. It has a small factory hole probably to help the siphon on top that I didn't notice till the 50 gallon container was full and I got home from work. Other than that the pump itself is great works every time.
B000EOR1DG|5|Easy to install . Nice solid but flexible unit! Easy quick install. Still looks great 9 months later!
B00SMP4M0Y|5|Thank you
B00QKJD4SK|5|Quality part with a great price
B0038AV968|4|Fit is slightly off, that's the only reason for a star deduction.
B00LFL8HQ2|5|Thanks so much.
B000CAO7XO|5|its in my car and holds all my 20 CDs and I love it
B000CAVE3K|1|Belt failed and came apart after less than a week.
B00KTHWP6Q|4|The unit works well once programmed. DO NOT LOSE THE PAPER WITH THE WEB ADDRESS THAT HAS THE PROGRAMMING INSTRUCTIONS!!!! These directions are impossible to find and the manufacturer has NO USEFUL INFORMATION in their website. The unit feels a bit cheap, but it seems to working well. Remember, you must have a working remote for the vehicle to program this remote.
B0032CXFRI|5|Very nice product for the price.
B009902Y4C|5|I'd call this the flagship pad for buffing. Can be used with mild or aggressive polish and leaves a smooth finish. I go down a couple of steps for a fine finish but its my go to pad for cutting/cleaning.
B000S2OR8Q|5|Took about 4 months, but it's here now.. significantly cheaper than any other online offering, so made it worth the wait if you have a budget.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Hard to find item that worked perfectly!
B00F25IP96|5|I like it a lot been on them for 20 something yrs now off and on<br />But this time it's on
B000C7ZUF6|5|Exact replacement, works fine, and I got a good deal dollar-wise as well.
B00IOBSXQ0|5|I found this product little over a year ago. This by far the best tire coating I have used. Nice shine and no tire sling. I wash my car weekly and only apply the tire shine every other week
B004HE09YC|4|These work reasonably well, especially for the price. Didn't feel much different from OEM Toyota pads in stopping power. The reason I've given 4 instead of 5 stars is that the clips and pads both were a bit trickier to get locked into place in the caliper, but hey, for half the price of OEM you can't really complain.
B00CNEQYF6|5|Perfect fit, easy installation.  Satisfied.
B000JKLEII|1|the mounting flanges were both welded on about 90 degrees in the wrong direction just like the other review says.
B003CGH13S|3|There is ALOT of flapping.  It is very tight cause its new. I am worried when it stretches over time how loud it will be.
B003X8OGBU|5|Super fun sticker which i affixed to my motorcycle I affectionately named &#34;Boat Anchor!&#34;  Good quality!
B000C2G988|4|Fit the head just fine with no issues. I am glad felpro ships these separately as well as in a kit.
B000C5WCV8|5|It was the original part and I am a satisfied customer.
B0080DIP38|1|The description misrepresented the filter would fit my Genesis 2012. Was not even close
B00ZZO0HWW|5|The product is exactly what I ordered and they arrived faster than I thought possible.  I was hoping for brighter, but really got what you would expect for power saving LED bulbs and I am very happy.  I found an RV fixture on Amazon which takes 2 bulbs and each is switched independent. With 2 of these LEDs I have great lighting, and I can switch one off when I need lower level light.  A perfect match for upgrading RV lighting systems at an incredibly low cost.  Unbeatable value for the price. Thank you!
B000GU5IH4|4|as advertised  no surprises!
B004KCVR06|5|Great product
B001QVZ5MK|5|great key chain fobs.
B00FADJ06C|1|Didnt fit like it was supposed to
B0055DPYTE|5|exactly as described.
B0000AXY5Y|5|Works as advertised. I have a large amount cranking to do to get my boat to drain and by using the drop leg and long stroke, I am not cranking and blocking twice.
B0000AYC87|3|good replacement cap but did not come with rubber grommet as shown and advertised :(
B00KTIQAZW|5|bought for my car then sold my car so i never used it but it looks great and I'm sure it works!!!
B001QT0VI0|1|Do NOT Buy. Made out of the cheapest possible material. My spit stick better than this thing.
B0010DLFF0|4|product was as advertised.
B003Z9WMUO|5|Great value, easy to install/uninstall. Does exactly as I needed.
B0058ECTZ2|3|nothing all that special, but works for soft buffing
B009S31VVW|4|It's still cheap plastic like the OEM one that broke. A metal part would be better but this was an exact fit and easy replacement. Saved over $100 by doing it myself.
B0064IU5FW|1|Faulty product straight from the box.The unit would not communicate with my ECM.I called cust service and was told i had to return it to vendor for a replacement.Returned product for refund.Not impressed.will have a very hard time ever considering a diablosport product again.
B007N6YZFA|5|I had purchased maybe three sets of lifts locally for my '93 Jeep GC and none were the right ones. This set from Strong Arm (through Amazon) fit perfectly as an exact replacement and so far have worked just fine.
B009W85OUC|4|Not bad for a universal fit, looks a lot better than the ripped cloth its covering up.
B001V9JSU2|5|Bought My bike a few years back and these came with the bike, although i still have the stock headers I still love these pipes! They truly are stereo friendly. The only bit I can add is that I would not buy these if you intend to lower your bike
B003YNGWV6|4|Parts arrived quickly, and I have tested them out and they work properly, I did find that the bulbs were from different manufactures but of the same type and brightness. Have to wait a little while before I install them; R&R always takes too long to get here.
B000FSZF5M|1|Had to repair as soon as item arrived
B0067UDKG8|4|great
B000CSNK98|2|The design is not that of the graphic illustration. The front termination is open rather than tucked into the mirror, allowing water to funnel in towards the front of the side windows, and it is not aesthetically appealing. Plainly designed to be cheaper to manufacture. The depth of space between the outer edge and the window is relatively small in comparision to other brands such as Weathertech. I will keep looking for a better product and give these to someone else
B0009NUG66|4|This bag worked well. I drove through a rain storm and everything inside stayed dry. The only thing to complain about is the optional anti slip mat that goes underneath, it can be noisy.
B005RR37P6|5|Love how this makes the interior of my 2014 Titan look. The LED's are nice and bright, and not too hard to install. Do a youtube search for how to's, and just do what they say. Minimal effort and tools required.
B000FQBWCY|5|Great product Fast shipping works great on my car.
B006G0MLG4|4|Like OEM which is a problem because they are weak and tend to break. If they were improved to last longer than OEM then I would give it a 5 star.
B000CC0IRQ|5|Awesome bruddah!!!!
B00R1WW95O|4|Looks good, Lost a little amount of reception, not bad.
B002P5C7PY|5|Was a big hit. I gave as a gift. Very nice quality.
B000BQR8TE|5|I love it because it does not leak!
B007TG7HHC|5|Bought these more than a year ago and they still work fine.
B00DD5Y636|5|Looks great
B001B71HW6|5|Work great and fit great.
B00GFTV4DC|4|It works as a air compressor oil, does the job.
B0009EUA0M|5|Awesome chair that works exactly as described, and with the right price.  You won't be let down.
B004RCSW6G|5|good replacement bulb for lights in my camper.
B0083TYGZ0|4|Look great in my car!  Installation was a little more difficult than I would have liked, but look fantastic
B00KTJ7U3M|4|Good
B0059XCVVO|2|Looks nice but doesn't stick very well
B000BUU5TU|5|Something that no one can do without if you own an RV or a horse trailer with living quarters. Works perfectly
B005JZVDQQ|1|returned it because it was wrong fit and still have not gotten my money back
B0066R4U6Q|5|This part was a perfect replacement for my 05 S60 R.
B00BJN085E|5|Excellent
B000W3RU9Y|4|Work just fine
B00KTJ9V16|5|Love it!  Thanks for having and offering this item!
B004TRKBOK|5|Love it
B00XB31RK0|5|Quick delivery, great part!
B0009IQXMC|5|Perfect fit
B00NGSDPGO|5|These worked very well getting a very high final shine using rubbing and polishing compound.  This was for a white painted bumper, so I don't know if they would last for a whole car,  but seem to have minimum wear.  I agree with the other comment that if you spin these too fast or with too much pressure, they will break down quickly.
B0002UHVX2|5|as advertised
B000A8JLIY|5|NGK Iridium IX is the best spark plugs for my Infiniti.
B004809YBE|5|Great, exactly what I needed.  Long but comes with a great carrying strap to keep it in place when not in use.  Very sturdy.
B00J5KRUHM|5|The best car trash item to date. Stays in place, easy to clean and holds plenty of trash.
B003Y8GPKY|5|Worked fine - Delivered before scheduled date
B00KY0KQ14|5|Working fine. Looks well build. 2 year warranty. Great price. Very well packed at shipping. 5 stars.
B0002KR88A|5|Good quality, heavy gauge wire
B00G4ATR54|1|This item has cost me so much $$ and stress it is unbelievable.... Let me count the ways....First outing with the new rack on my RV bumper (we also have purchased the 4' square tubing Curt receiver and install) and my husbands nice, always garaged Trek MTB goes flying out on a little two lane highway (as we are traveling about 45mph) and crashes out into a million pieces. So fearing that we have somehow incorrectly placed the bikes on the rack, we ensure we have read and installed all things correctly. We then spend an additional $1,200 on a new bike, get  all bikes in rack as instructed and reinforce with an additional Ratchet strap and we head off for our long awaited vacay.....Keep in mind all bikes have been evaluated for snugging by the padded hook that holds the bikes in, the ratchet strap is snug as well.  Bottom line, the hook (as it had done in the prior incident) had gotten loose and the bike has came out of the rack and my daughter's new Trek MTB is out on an 8 lane major interstate with wild traffic...A driver gets beside of us and lets us know there is a problem, so we pull over and find the nightmare has returned, Only this time we are in heay city traffic, so I feel it is absolutely a must to get this hazard out of the road! I get out and pick up the major pieces left because it will be continuously ran over until it is out of the way.  Again, we have to spend  more $$ on another bike!! The bottom line.... There is a really bad engineering flaw in this rack, there has to be a locking mechanism to be sure it doesn't come out and there isn't one!..... Do yourself a favor and choose another rack!! After I called Curt about the problem, basically I was told it wasn't designed for RV's (not sure why they have the 4&#34; reciever that is RV specific)... After re-reading the item details, it does NOT state this cannot be used on an RV.Additionally the padded hooks have scratched all of our frames :(((  Amazon is fabulous, however and I give them 5 stars, Thank you Amazon! I am sending this back ASAP.nk you Amazon! I am sending this back ASAP.
B003CJJQYM|4|The risers are fine, of amazing quality. The delivery time was satisfactory. Unfortunately they don't fit properly my 2003 Suzuki GSX600F aka Katana so I won't be able to use them and probably resell them.
B004WLXRGC|5|Fits perfectly. Timely shipment.
B00N77WSDA|2|Didn't look clean , was small too
B004ZF39T0|3|These work great....when they work. I ordered a set and 1 of the bulbs didn't work. I ordered a replacement set and 1 of those didn't work. They are very bright and useful though!
B0048FQIUY|5|outstanding material. I prefer this material over the carpet version.
B00AR5Y7WK|5|Great fit
B00136OJZ2|3|fine for the price but the screw holes are too small and the back plate breaks off when i try to drill the holes bigger.
B003RAYECK|5|Works great. Great Customer support, took a few trys to find the correct instructions. So nice to have a remote again.
B00JJXQ2G0|3|Cheap , ships fast but not very durable a product. That's no problem with the seller more the product itself
B00YE5Q132|5|[[VIDEOID:80b9f61572938ff8664465d1e6b590dd]] The video was filmed by my husband at work, with the help of his very enthusiastic colleague. I have told him he needs to speak more and grunt less when reviewing a product.<br />The Portable Jump Starter comes in a very convenient hard-cover carry case (opens via zip) 24length x 11widex8cm high..<br />I have had my husband testing and reviewing this, because he is a car mechanic. He was and is really surprised by how efficient this jump start set is, and he has tried quite a few and also has access to industrial units the use in the garage.<br />It is easy to use, he also said the carry case is great, because you take it anywhere, as it doesn't take up much space. He is interested to see if he gets the same results from the device in colder weather. (I will update at a later date)<br />The difference betweeen this kit and others, is that it shows you the battery status of power unit via four LED lights on the front of the unit.<br />To use any of the functions of the unit you must first turn the on/off button onto the ON position. The automatic position is on USB load, so to start a car you have to press the POWER button and select Voltage and connect to OUtput on the left side of the unit.<br />You can set the outgoing voltage by picking 19V/16V/12V (up to 5Ah). The battery status of the unit, then you have the<br />power button: to select the actual voltage, to turn the flashlight on/off, or SOS flash, or the warning red/blue light ( please be aware it is illegal to use the red/blue light in some countries including the UK).<br />OUtput: (2Ah) USB output, which is used to load any device which uses a USB port to load.<br />INput plug  is for loading the actual power unit. The Device comes with a charger, which you can plug into your car cigarette lighter or into a mains plug to charge. It takes about 4/5 hours to recharge completely. However my husband has used this to jump start at least 3 cars now within the last 3 weeks and hasn't had to recharge it yet. Apparently according to the description it can jump start up to 80 times before having to be recharged.<br />ON/Off on the right side of the unit.<br />Engine/START (also on the right side) is covered by rubber cover because it is permanently powered by 12V and 12Ah.<br />However you can not load two things at once. You can either use the unit to load a divice OR to start a car. Not both things at the same time.<br />Included in the hard-cover case is also mains charger cable, car charger cable, USB micro charging cable, adapter cable for output plugs, set of charging plugs for laptops or any device charged between 12 and 19V, the actual jump start cable.<br />Most importantly the case has an instruction manual and internal jumpstarter capacity and vehicle emissions check list , which is integrated into the case and visually always at the front. It states clearly that to jump start any car the car battery must be at at least 50%.<br />I f you decide to take it with you make sure it is fully loaded.<br />My husband highly recommends this power unit.<br />I received a free copy of this product, courtesy of the company for purposes of review.eeks and hasn't had to recharge it yet.

B003D1QVJ2|5|Excellent product, these can save your wheels from getting stolen.
B00C2M4GK4|5|Plastic cover that hides the hole on my Mopar winch bumper VERY nicely!  Looks factory (cause it is).
B00GSAUHB8|5|It is lightweight, we use alternately between both cars, whichever is outside for the day. It prevents burning your hands in the hot sun when using transmission gears on the dashboard.
B005CXLFTK|5|Worked perfect
B00TEA1W04|5|Awesome tailgate vent cover!  This is far superior to the flat pieces of steel some sell to cover the vent.  On this one you don't have to remove the louvers that regulate air in the cabin.
B001R1Q62W|5|Fit perfectly...Looks great...
B006ZJ1XF6|1|Terrible ride quality.  I wish I didnt throw the factory ones away.
B00NHD026E|2|Not as big as i thought
B00651CLCS|5|Nice short
B008RUINI6|5|Just right thank you
B00CFPSEZ6|4|exactly as expected. the front visor drops down on its own...but since I'm only using it on a side window, it works perfectly to keep the light out of my eyes.<br /><br />I read one review that suggested buying velcro tape, but the plastic straps it comes with are fine for me.  (though, I did buy the tape pro-actively but haven;t used it.)
B00IJJOW6M|5|Get a lot of attention..
B00CCYW9JC|4|Great.
B003VLBPJA|5|Works great
B001C97VXW|1|Came with two O-rings, but NOT the main gasket.  I bought this based on the review by &#34;J&#34;.
B00183ILZE|3|Supposedly it was ideal for a VTX 1800C. Although the cover appears well-made, it's way too baggy for  good fit on the bike.  The length is OK, but there's a lot a material sitting on the ground.  Should have an option for with/without a windshield.
B00S75A5LE|5|These are great. Not as bright as Xenon but much brighter than stock halogen headlights. I bet in the near future this technology will beat Xenon.<br />Installation was pretty straight forward. If I had to rate halogen/xenon (full kit not just the bulbs) /LED due to its difficulty in installation I would give 1 to halogen, 10 to Xenon and 2 to these LEDs.<br /><br />These LEDs make everything glow in the dark. Traffic signs glow like no other headlight I've seen.<br />Power consumption is really good. When I turned on my stock halogens the revs would go up a bit but with these there's no rev change.<br />The only downside is that the headlight housing needs to be a projector because of how the LEDs are placed.<br />Though they are not cheap, I'm very pleased with these headlights. The manufacturer did a really good job.
B0025OQQRA|5|These pads were just as described and arrived in a timely fashion.<br />I would buy this dealer again
B00JIIZCM6|5|So far so good!  I got this because I had some spots on a leather chair that just didn't seem to go away.  This removed them and made it look all nice and shiny again.  I also plan on using it on my car seats, but haven't tried yet.
B0009JKI86|1|Didn't come with the adapter to fit on my Chevy PU making it useless
B007KSQOPU|5|Good quality.
B007UMA4J8|5|Looks great. No concerns with it holding up as stitching seems strong.
B00RGZWIW0|4|product as advertised and works well
B003HFV61M|2|Transmitters too big and heavy.  Caused me to be stranded due to air leak at rim.
B00KFZJDGW|5|Very nice!
B0098B6ZQK|5|Great protection for an expensive key. Material is  soft and grips well. Fits snugly over the key leaving only the metal part exposed. Note: only works well if you have &#34;keyless start&#34; as key will not fit key slot with this product installed.
B00EZV05OQ|5|Does as advertised on television lightweight durable great product
B00BXMRP4I|4|Machine has worked very well for me,  Draws vacuum very quickly on car automotive systems including the 48oz system found in the dual A/C suburbans.<br /><br />I should have read more reviews, this pump requires the &#34;FJC 6014&#34; adapter to hook up to r134a manifold gauges.<br /><br />I am docking 1 star due to the fact that no replacement parts are available!  My unit arrived with a cracked oil sight glass that leaks oil, upon contacting the seller.  I was issued a partial refund and I am satisfied although my &#34;savings&#34; may be used up in replacement oil costs.  Fortunately I do not use this too frequently.<br /><br />Hindsight being what it is I would most likely order the slightly more expensive 1.5cfm Robinair unit, I don't believe the 3cfm model is necessary for doing car A/C systems and the parts availability would be nice for a tool that could potentially last me a lifetime.
B001T50WRQ|3|I loved this key fob. Great look but it broke after 6 months. The leather flap holding the Army insignia ripped.
B0048IY3SU|3|Had no threads for mounting bolts. Had to thread them. Other than that, it's OK.
B00PX1OWA0|4|Product is as described and is functional.  Nothing exceptional to rate the &#34;I love it&#34; 5th star
B00B5L5QJ8|4|It puts the power out alright, but the high idle is to much at 1900 rpm. The service engine soon lite comes on and stays on. They did ship it quick!
B007TY1TJQ|5|Fits my 1997 GMC Suburban...great price!!!
B00334ZY4W|4|Yellow on fell down in the sight line, had to remove it.
B00OPZLAJ6|1|Does not fit into a 2001 bmw 330i e46. Not because it's the incorrect size, it's just a peice of shit and u realize it right when u open ur package and it says ''made in china.&#34; It is impossible to get the peices to sit into position properly.
B000CSIP7U|5|Old filter was oil soaked after the Mule was turned on its side and engine wouldn't run very good so just replaced it. Runs fine now. Perfect fit.
B000BQWY8Y|1|I bought this maybe 4 years ago but never opened it until today - I thought the directions were very poor - no illustration to know how much comprised the end of the syringe, what parts were what, etc,  I finally pushed hard enough to lock the nozzle and twist 90 degrees.  I am 73, a female who accomplishes other building tasks but am not very strong.  It was extremely hard to push the glue out of the tubes - finally I realized that it was only coming out of one tube - the other had dried in the past to the point where it couldn't flow.  I tried enlarging the exit hole after pulling off the syringe - it  still did not flow out, and finally got my DeWalt drill and drilled a hole on the side of the tube holding the yellowish liquid.  It came out in blobs and I tried to push it over the clear fluid already down.  I was attaching a piece of plastic pipe to the bird bath basin.  I ended up applying a thick coat - am afraid it is not going to dry as I could not adequately mix the 2 solutions, given that one was partially dry.  So much for this method of mixing the 2 compounds.  An expiration date should be listed on the package!!!

B001KOPFIW|3|I got the kit for $20. If I had paid the $100 I'd be posting 1 star.. To start, the breaking pin snapped half way through. The head of the rivet has been ground down before, and the pressure to the pin was applied and removed as advised.<br /><br />Then when riveting the new link pins, the large anvil broke! Luckily it was on the second pin and I was nearly done so I finished with the small anvil.. So now, in order to use this tool again, I have to purchase at least a new anvil and breaking pin. The way the pieces broke you'd be hardly think they were hardened steel. They didn't snap and explode, they simply crumbled like cheap pot metal would.
B00G9W9H2U|5|Good price for a bag for our sleeping bags. Doesn't really compress a lot but I kept it anyway because we needed a holder for our sleeping bags and it was easy to carry around because of the straps.
B00EE56UAG|5|This product works as stated and I am very satisfied with the purchase.
B0007UQ2MS|5|I was skeptical at first but have since ordered two more.  These hoses are great and have not kinked on me once.  I was very happy with my purchase which BTW was very reasonable.
B00NQVLZ1I|3|Maybe my car is not so good for it
B00K884CIA|4|It was easy to cut out into the shape of my 2012 Honda CR-V. The material doesn't feel super high quality, but for the price, it's hard to beat!
B00BF11OQ2|5|They came broken and had to glue them together
B001EGT3I4|5|Fantastic product, changed both sides. I ordered 2 just to have on hand, right front bearing blew out a week later. Exact fit on my Tahoe. Easy repair, allow 45 minutes per side for uncomplicated repair. Wish I could predict lotto numbers that well.
B004PC4AOG|5|Fit my 05 R6 perfectly! Install was extremely easy. No complaints at all.
B00KRE2RPK|5|Guy at Ford tried to scare me into not buying this, saying they couldn't guarantee it wouldn't break in their machine. Ended up working fine and saved me a hundred bucks.
B0002SRF4O|5|Great addition to any tool box.
B000BNOI8G|1|It works ok but does not stick well to my jeep if anybody is looking for this light I would not recommended anyone to buy it it needs a better light and a better magnetic
B008ECDFSK|5|Product is absolutely perfect 😊
B002L1AYCA|5|Great and solid flywheel well worth it
B00I51L28K|5|Worked great on 99 Jetta
B00DBENEUU|1|Very disappointed they were not bright at all I would never order anymore
B004AIOZFO|5|As others have said, make sure you buy three M6-1.00 hex bolts and dont forget the washers!  For the reviewer who said it didn't fit his 2008 Mariner.....uh, no duh, this part is for 2001-2007 models.  This replacement has an extension plug for the motor to the harness.  I suggest pulling it through so it doesn't get in the way of the window glass when it comes down.  You may need to fully cycle the power to your vehicle after installation.  I turned on the acc setting and the rear windows didn't work.  Once I started the vehicle it worked no problem.
B000N56222|5|This is an amazing pump!!!
B00P5YPESO|1|Too big for my wheels even though the ad said they would fit.
B00JX8H6OS|5|look and work great
B002UC6R2Q|5|I'm using it as a step into my shop off my pool deck.  it's sturdy and yet movable.
B00J2PL774|1|Cheap - clear lens on the outside means you see the bulb.  Wish I would of noticed before buying!  Junk
B005GQT144|5|About an inch of drop, and a 3-hour install with hand tools and a 6-year old helping.  I'm on 18s, and have noticed a slight increase in NVH, but it's minimal.  Improved an already fun platform.
B002V0NG4E|5|Perfect 60th birthday present for my husband. He was so excited
B00BSGJQ4Q|5|Excellent brightness.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|My purchase was delivered faster then promised, very happy with my item
B00BR92XJ4|4|Had to drill out to fit.  Works O.K.
B00HLBG0UK|5|got it today i love it and fast serives i like amazon serirves
B00MMPKYP2|2|cheap material and were too small
B002SB02PC|5|AAA
B00EKTIOS2|5|perfect
B001RUFBK6|5|Look great, fit well. I'm very happy with this purchase
B00LM5692A|3|I had no feeling about it
B00B8KBNDY|5|Great LED Lights.  Sets my Hyundai Sonata apart from all of the other cars.
B000NN6B9I|5|no more header bolts backing out, 30,000 miles and no signs of any header leaks
B000EVYHOU|5|Great analog gauge work very well
B00B9ZJT7A|5|nice
B00QU0HD0E|5|Installed sensor and it works great.
B003XT8Y26|5|Easy to install and the car looks much better with the new mats.
B0019C17AA|5|It looked really good, but it just wasn't my style so I had it returned. They were extremely nice and easy with the process and everything. The mesh had a nice look and everything but I just preferred the OEM. But excellent customer service. 10/10 would order from them again
B000IY6VF6|5|Great product
B00BITI4L4|1|To cheap it brakes very easy I had plenty replace
B000F285EG|4|What's there to say? It works as advertised.
B000PS8J64|4|My washer sits on it and haven't had issues with it.
B0015SCLNA|5|works great
B00NJXU8BG|5|the Fred FHRITP stickers were right on target. Fred nails it every time!
B006UH51R4|5|As expected
B00SDGVK84|5|Perfect overhead multi outlet extension cord for my work bench in the middle of the garage.
B00BRHM8FA|4|Works as advertised.
B001B59NYW|5|Awesome
B004Y9YJ0A|4|Wires are to short to work with.  Besides that they will light up the hwy on my bike.
B00TQ0S7QE|2|I got a Fix It ticket for not having a front license plate on my car. I bought this as I thought it was the best way to get a license plate mounted without having to drill holes in my bumper.  The first thing that threw me off was that this product arrived with no instructions. I thought that I should be able to figure this out even without instructions so I ventured forward.  I easily got the tow hook bar installed and I tried to figure out the best position to keep the plate from blocking the parking sensors (more on this later). The product came with one long screw that I presumed was used to mount the license plate frame to the tow hook mount. There were 4 screws and nuts that I assumed were for mounting the license plate to the frame. There was also a steel washer and a rubber washer. I assumed that these washers were also for mounting the tow hook bar to the frame. I tried various combinations using these washers. With the rubber washer, I could never get the plate to stay tight. No matter how much torque I put on the screw, the plate would easily rotate as long as that rubber washer was there. I didn't want the license plate to get knocked loose if I hit a bump on the road and spin around and scratch my bumper. I ditched the rubber washer and only used the metal one. I still wasn't getting it tight enough that I felt confident that it wouldn't get dislodged. I ended up tightening it as best as I could with the plate mount rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise of the position I would ultimately want it to be in. Once it was as tight as I could get it, I rotated it the final 90 degrees and it felt good enough to safely drive.  Now it was time to mount the plate. I wouldn't say that I have short, fat fingers but this was a pain. The screws and nuts were awful. The threads didn't match up well with the nuts. You can't get the nuts and bolts on finger tight. You must use a standard wrench on the nuts and an Allen Wrench on the bolts to tighten them. Wouldn't it havebeen much easier to just use a Phillips head screw? I only used the top two mounting bolts.  The absolute worst part of this product was that no matter how I mounted the plate, every time I put the car in reverse, I would be greeted by the loud squeal of the parking sensor warning me that I was about to crash into my front license plate. There was no good place to put it. Once I got it mounted, I immediately drove to the police station and got my Fix It ticket written off. I drove back home and took it off and dumped it in a box in my garage. Considering the price, I would have expected it to be better engineering for the specific car that it is claimed to be used with. The description says it is compatible with the 2014 4 series BMW which is the car I needed this for.  The only good thing about this product is that it got me out of a Fix It ticket and it only gets two stars for that but no more. I've gone over 20 years without a front plate even though it is technically illegal in California and this is the first time I have been cited for it. I think I'll take my chances and sell this to someone if I can't return it. If this ever happens to me again, I'll just get some double sided foam tape and save myself a bunch of time and money. I suggest you do the same.
B00T36HLYU|5|Good fit
B00D5CGEAK|5|perfect replacement
B00F7HD8AA|5|Logged into internet to order blank oval bumper sticker and print my own 0.0.  Looks like others had idea first and several for sale.  It is good size and bold print.  Placing next to my hiking club and backpacker stickers.  Just because I dont run does not mean I died!
B0085LU4LQ|5|This is a great addition to my suburban.
B007QMWPIK|3|Did not mount on with bolts provided but it is still nice!
B0006H8AEK|4|They are ok.  I wish the mirror was just a little larger.  They didn't vibrate on me, and they fit good.  Not a perfect fit, but better than I thought they would for the price. Like I state they are a  good price, and beats the ones that they had with a suction cup at the auto parts store.  I would buy these again.
B00PGH52SM|5|Daughter doesn't like it, but I love it!!!
B0002MA4WA|5|Came with plenty of screws to fasten them down with.  Went on pretty fast. One set per 8 foot 2 X12 is just right.
B000PHHSM6|5|just what I was looking for
B003P64XU4|4|works great
B009H6L44Y|1|We purchased 10 different led light bars and 1/2  have water in them just from rain and humidity.  The company is not doing anything. Exact words  from the company \\"our products will generate moisture inside of them from average rain and humidity, because they are not water proof.\\" They have lost my business! If you want a product that is $*** then this is the one for you. Don't waste your time or money!
B004K23KQ0|5|Just what I expected.  It is solid and well made.
B008DEX90S|1|Just would not work on my 2011 GMC.  Tech support could not fix problem.  If someone wants to buy it I will sell cheap.
B005N00FV6|5|The guy who had the truck was very happy to put it on his truck and loves it.
B00XN1DAP0|5|Awesome! Can't wait to install it in my PUP. Dry hooked it up to my battery and found that the meter actually uses 30 mA and when a phone is hooked up to either usb socket it usesabout 110 mA to charge. I can only assume that the 1A and 2.1A come into play when this is hooked up to a running motor with a charging system.  The wires supplied are about 18&#34; long with connectors already attached, all hardware was supplied for mounting.
B00BNX88ZW|5|Lot cheaper than the dealer, fits right in
B003A82GV0|5|great
B003CKG554|4|I found these to fit perfectly for my 03 VFR. However, they do not exactly match the oem. Buy a pair for a perfect match.
B000EDQQD8|5|This is perfect for what I want. It has an idiot gauge to tell you if pressure is on the high or low side. It feels heavier than I expected as the sidewalk thickness is pretty decent. I am using this in conjunction with my camco water filter (before filter), and then into my campers water connection.
B0002KR88A|5|10AWG WIRE IS BIG
B001DRJMZI|5|Always use this brand in my VWs.
B00DSD7J8W|5|It was exactly what I expected, and arrived ahead of schedule.
B0009I2OIE|5|It is made for the 2007 Jeep Liberty Sport - the fit guide is wrong - I called the company before ordering.  Arrived a day late, but went in pretty easily.  Works great ! Note: You need a stiff wire to fish the wires up through on the passengers side fender.
B00OH0S5Y2|5|Great product, long lasting bulbs, have yet to go out or start to flash, best ones I have used so far
B002G244UM|4|Got this for my step dad as a part of his birthday gift, he loved it! Thinking about getting one for myself!<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend!
B00EYTIF28|3|Looks good but cheeply made
B004ZF4RXC|5|These HID's are great and the kit was easy to install.  However at less than a year old one light lost its color.  I purchased the 6K lights and now the one on the passenger side is yellow extremely disappointed.  I hope Kensun is reading this.  These are supposed to outlast the vehicle.
B00JTUBTU2|5|Second time I've purchased this oil for a '97 Camaro SS  with a 5.7L V8 engine that now has 165,000 miles.  No oil stains on the garage floor, so it does indeed condition the oil seals to prevent leaks.  Mobil 1 synthetic oil is the good stuff, so definitely continue to buy
B004FOM86Q|4|Good quality, but priced accordingly.
B000CB0JZ8|4|got exactly what I need!
B004GECR1Q|1|It was all bent. Should of just kept my old one.
B00L2QM806|2|The shade itself is great but the suction cups are horrible! I had to get a different pair of suction cups.
B000CSIS54|5|This spark plug creates a FIRE right NOW  !!<br />Thank You Fast shipping !!
B00EECXAY8|5|Works exactly as intended and fits VERY securely. I was having an issue with a OBD 2 adapter into the port on the car and it would never seem to connect very well. I plugged this cable in and then the adapter to and now it is securely and reliably connected.
B000WK4EC8|5|This stuff is great, I've been using it for a few years now on my Harley.
B00KGMHCM6|2|ordered for twin grandsons birthday,we never got the blue one.We had two of the same color and one very sad young man.Will order local now cause this is twice in a row I was not happy.
B00B2ATBRU|4|Simple hook up, clean look . only negative , flip down panel hard to read ,fortunately the remote is simple and works well.
B000CB977E|3|Shocks are good for what they are, I was hoping for a little extra comfort in my ride, but they ride similar to a cheaper shock absorber. I purchased 4 shocks and two of them did not come in there original boxes and were missing parts. One shock looked like it had been used before.
B000BGHSNK|5|Exact replacement on my rig. Works perfect. Thanks! Good price.
B0050Z9T0C|5|I installed these HIDs in a car, look good, great product. I brought two other lights from them before, just a different bulb size, and all three of these never gave me problems. There easy to install if you have basic knowledge of cars. It comes with instructions if you don't know what to do and you could always follow along with a youtube video. If you want HIDs, I would highly recommend this product, especially when you get a two year warranty with it.
B00PHXMMKQ|5|Quick response. Easy to install and looks great.
B006U42QUC|5|works as intended.
B002P3KJLU|5|Just what I needed to run cold water to a outdoor kitchen faucet.
B000BQR100|2|I bought these shades since I live in a particularly sunny part of California and thought it may be beneficial to not only keep my car cool, but also to protect the dashboard from sun damage.<br />Folding these things is more difficult than trying to teach my cat to speak in Arabic. Not only that, but putting them on feels awkward, especially around the rear view mirror. Also managed to tear a few small holes with only light usage.
B000EQS0SY|5|Perfect fit and functions great!
B00LLOG80K|5|I drive a 350z and I thought it looked to big but I put it on the back window left corner and I love how it looked cute sticker
B00G6IO4NO|5|It worked great
B007ACZTGQ|1|Bad customer service. These locks are very poor quality.  My 5/8 lock BENT badly.  Trimax said it was my fault because I used an equalizer hookup for my camper.  Really??!! I think most people that will use these locks will be using equalizer hitches if they have a camper or large trailer.
B004RCP49O|5|This stuff is incredible!  super sticky, super flexible, even when dry.  I highly recommend it for fixing up potential leaks in your trailer.
B006OQ35GU|5|Works well, as advertised.
B000BR3BF8|5|Bought this one for my brother as the one I bought over 5 years ago still is the same filter on my car. All I needed is clean it every 2-3 years and that's it. It's true when K&N say it's reusable. I don't really know how K&N makes money on a repeat-buyer program when it's like a FOREVER type of product.  I'm not a recommend-product type of person but this one did it for me, I feel like I had to and that starts with my brother. I'm now a K&N fan !!!
B00XT0U4C2|5|Lights look great and easy to install.
B005C588MU|5|Replacing this part fixed a flickering tail light issue with the front brake on my 2009 R1.<br />Simple install, with one phillips head screw and two slip-on wires.
B000HS1356|5|Fit ok!!!
B00J5947ME|4|Good product.  Sealed my leaking tank very well.  It is a little aggravating to work with, but the results are worth the trouble
B00U1XOS54|5|Couldn't be easier to install.
B0096BAQ80|5|Arrived on time and great fit.
B0006I0NBC|5|Perfect for my use, nice chrome finish, and they mount well, comes with hardware.
B00PJPHEBO|2|It broke after about 1 month.  Prior to then it was pretty cool.
B0036E9VB6|5|Compact, powerful. Really great.  The only thing that could be improved is to provide something to clip the hose that screws onto the tire to when stowing it, then it would be a tight compact package.
B00EE56UAG|5|An added sense of security for my helmet as a deterrent against thieves/vandals
B0002Q7RFI|4|Nice quality v-belt for a good price.  I used it to replace my John Deere 48&#34; deck belt.  JD OEM belt are way over priced.
B000BUQOFO|5|just what I was looking for.
B0016J7H5U|4|Fits my 2001 Pathfinder but the pair is noticeably stronger than stock. You could probably get away with 1 if your hatch stays open on it's own with your old struts, mine did but barely. The bracket was different than the stock Stabilus but it still fit.
B00069V310|5|Best damn money you can ever spend for repairs
B0088JR9X6|5|Great product at an even better price. Works perfect! Recommend over more expensive adapters.
B004JC6E82|5|Works great on my dad's pick up, was a two man job to install but was easy and quick. Thank you!
B001HXXWGS|5|I have been using this for 3 years and love it.
B00192JGY4|5|Accurate, and well built.
B006VFR2GS|3|Well made and sturdy clamps but they are very small.  I don't know what fire extinguishers they are supposed to fit
B00379ABX2|4|As listed
B00E1J0BGE|1|Don't expect miracle. This looks like some cheap plastic. I ordered all weather mats, they sent me cargo mat, which was also like some cheap plastic. Only thing this have is CRV logo, otherwise nothing impressive. They do not fit well. the back seat mat keeps slipping out of place. The whole process of returning cargo mat and getting all weather meats was painful. It tool two weeks. I personally do not recommend these. Thanks.
B00BVRB1U4|5|Very nicely done, but weird. Everywhere &#34;USN&#34; or US Navy&#34; appears, there's a little ™ following it. Really? The Navy is trademarked? WTF?
B000CAINT8|5|Well made, comfortable, and easy to use and remove for other driver.
B00CO6OLFS|5|Work Great..
B00SA25KWI|5|LOVE IT
B00EUZNCVK|5|2nd pair for me. Great glove. They wear fast for me but I like their fit.
B00EPDL6T2|5|I bought this as a gift for my husband!  He is a North Carolina Tar Heels Fan.  He loves this so much!  It took some time putting it on, but it fits perfectly.  This is probably my husband's favorite gift this year! lol
B000IYZNFK|5|Fit great. No issues
B00N2Z46DW|1|did not fit my 2015 hd street glide special
B006G2M1M6|5|Good fit good price just need shorter bolts
B00S0PK2GY|4|Fit perfectly on 2007 Mazda 6 and they look much nicer than the stock knobs. I made a small modification with some slivers of white vinyl stickers to indicate what position they were in because it was almost impossible to tell what they were set at during the day, without the lights on.
B00840JS5Q|5|$100 cheaper than the mechanic and easy to install! Hopefully solves the problem of them overheating.
B009B1J172|4|I like it was happy
B00L1EKGBM|5|Great product easy to install
B000BQSIWK|5|This charger works really well and I appreciate the smart aspects.
B004A6NBBA|5|Perfect fit. Nice filter. Air smells nice and clean.
B000EQ022G|5|Centric Parts has always been my number one choice of quality automotive replacement items. My OEM Honda front left caliper was getting stuck and warped my rotor. I decided that it would be more viable to buy a rebuilt caliper than do it myself.  This listing is only for the Front Left (142.40046) so make sure to buy the Front Right (142.40045) [[ASIN:B000EQ0262 Centric Parts 142.40045 Posi Quiet Loaded Friction Caliper]] It is always recommended to replace both calipers at the same time to make sure they apply at the same time for even brake wear.  This caliper is basically a full rebuild with all new gaskets, caliper pins and boots. There is also a new bleeder valve attached with a cover. You will have to use your old brake caliper bolts to connect it onto the rotor, though.  My pins were not greased so make sure to use 3M Clear Silicone Paste because other greases (brake pad grease) will swell up the rubber boots and not allow the pins to guide freely, causing uneven wear on your rotor and pads. The bore of the caliper and its gaskets are brand new and will expand evenly.  The only downside of these calipers is that they were painted a slight gold metallic that was already flaking off. Although it was a bad paint job, it looked better than rusted calipers which I'm sure most people have. I sandblasted my calipers and powder coated them black so it didn't matter for me in the end.
B00E9HWS9G|5|Excellent mat fits great
B00IDHJZXU|1|Couldn't believe how such an expensive, &#34;quality&#34; product was so poor at what it was created to do!-talking to another rider!  Radio, music, settings all were great.  But intercomming to the other rider was a horrible experience.  It was so static-y and was impossible to understand them!  We thought it was mainly at high speeds, 60-80mph, but even as we came off the freeway and were on little streets, 30-40mph, it was hard to understand each other. Also, the voice command function was so hot and cold.  It would work sometimes, but often, it would just turn the music off when that wasn't at all what I asked for. So I would not recommend this product.  I think they added to many flourishes and then compromised the quality of the basic function of talking to another rider.  We are now trying a cheaper and older version of these: the Q3.  Hoping for better results since it's a simpler product.
B002R0J3Q8|4|Came on time, perfect fit
B00KTIVL10|3|one of them don't work paid way too much money for it not to work
B005PZ7B48|5|I was very glad to find this fuel tank cap for our 1995 Madza Miata.  Finding parts for older cars sometimes is very hectic.  It worked perfectly and helped with the 02 Sensor problem also.
B004BTBAL4|5|perfect fit
B000C5WCUE|5|Thank you for having this product available to us to repair our 1995 Madza Miata Oxygen Sensor problem.  It worked perfectly and was no trouble to install.  Also, it arrived quickly to our home.
B003D50KM2|5|perfect match for half the price
B00EVMT6A8|5|Good quality mirrors and just whatI needed
B002MFXQV6|5|GOOD PRICE
B00O8FKU80|5|I get lots of complements !
B009XZW0CY|5|Really like these!!!
B00B4XD51I|2|Like many of the other users have noticed, the black paint on this frame comes off after a few months. Also, mine didn't come with screws or screw caps.
B001KSGFPK|5|Part came ahead of schedule and works perfect.
B00SQG8JL2|5|Awesome!!!! Exactly what you expect to get.
B009KBUR2Q|4|Cleans well!
B005HAYDR4|5|Like them so much I'm ordering 2 more for the back seat roll bars
B000GKD6VY|4|it seems desent
B005HR2G3A|5|Well more lites for the bike. Easy to install.<br /> Quality is excellent. Shipping was extremely fast. I was surprised  i got them so quick.
B002WH7AY8|5|exactly what i wanted!
B00FFU70SU|5|Fit and look amazing. Everyone saying they don't fit well is because you have to file them down some for the TURBO veloster. These were built for the NAV or non-turbo models
B00HHGRYAY|5|The item is fantastic,  it match the car, and I saved about 700$ . Thanks Amazon & thanks the seller.
B0085H6J9G|1|Going to send it back!  Switch did not control driver side window.  All other windows work okay!
B000IEZDZ0|5|fits great looks great
B009DJTSDY|5|Excelent quality, delivered as expected
B000E8V9RG|5|Very easy to put on and better flow.
B008OXHB9S|5|Very nicely made, sturdy, spacious bag.  Well constructed.  Will carry what you need on a weekend trip, or longer if you organize well.
B00PMLFD4U|5|The shipping was quick with tracking so I knew when to expect delivery. I'm comparatively new to BMW ownership but a long time motorcycle owner who likes to maintain my own bikes. My 3 year BMW warranty was expiring and I was faced with the decision to buy an extended warranty for around $900 for 3 years. I used the decision to not go for the extended warranty as the justification for buying the GS-911 tool. Although my current motorcycle is a 2012 and can use the older model GS-911 I decided to prep for future BMW motorcycle purchases by opting for the latest WiFi version.<br /><br />Installation instructions for the software were easy to follow. I have a PC laptop that is now devoted to my garage for this. My primary laptop is a MacBook Pro and I'd prefer if the software was Apple compatible but I can live with it. I also installed the GS-911 app on my iPad and iPhone.<br /><br />If you work on your own BMW motorcycle that's covered by the GS-911 line this is a very good tool.
B000JKFNQM|4|Ordered this and it was shorted out.  Seller replaced with another and its working fine.
B006WBDSL4|5|He was $13!!  But, he is cute.  The oldies will remember him, while the young 'uns will wonder about him.  Hope he lasts.
B00PYCXH7C|1|Already been through one disc in two months after only three uses at 3800rpm.  Plus they soak up all the wax, turning it into a wax blob.  Used just as I did the old larger pads.  The old larger pads were made much better, using them every month or two for over a year.
B00MGURX66|1|bulb blew out after 3 months
B0034ZUZM6|4|Great winch for the money.  Hard to find a good place for the solenoid.  Works great though. Glad I got it. Got me out of some tough spots.
B00GWFB4NO|4|They feel kind of cheap but they look GREAT on my bike and I've already received multiple compliments about them.  I mean, heck, they're valve stems, but I do wish they were all metal as opposed to plastic.
B00COKCRMI|5|we all know why you put this on your car.
B00AQKRYXA|5|Perfect fit for our 2012 Suburban. Super easy to clean.  Couldn't be happier.
B00C8C6ON0|5|Fit perfectly and seems identical to OEM. No reason to pay more.
B007I6R9M6|5|Excellent value for those who are tired of paying HIGH dealer prices for simple maintenance items.  Thank you!!
B000OAG2DK|5|This shower head is so much better than the stock shower head that came with our Jayco Eagle travel trailer. I love the on/off switch!
B004C65DYQ|4|Genuine Toyota
B000CIXZPW|5|Make sure to replace your end links in pairs. This item is for your rear LEFT (K90453). For the rear RIGHT, it is K90452.<br /><br />If your car squeaks like crazy going over every small bump, it's probably your sway bar.<br /><br />First make sure your bushings are greased properly and have not worn down from contact with the bar.<br />If your bushings are shot, then replace them with bushings that have grease zerk fittings such as Energy Suspension.<br />They will last longer since they would be lubricated and you won't have to take it apart to grease.<br /><br />Next, check your sway bar end links. If the boots on your end links are ripped, then you need new end links.<br /><br />Right out of the box these end links are noticeable heavier and about 2x thicker so they can be used with larger aftermarket sway bars.<br />They also have a large rubber boot that is already greased but can hold a lot more grease than my factory ones.<br />These also come with grease zerk fittings so you can grease them instead of replacing them if the grease disappears over time.<br /><br />The end links also have a different installation system instead of your factory one that required a hex key and a crescent wrench.<br />These use a regular nut and you just need something to hold the other end when installing.<br />There are 0 chances of you stripping the end link which saves you a lot of time.<br /><br />I installed these on my 2003 Honda Civic Coupe.
B003VGQ6AI|5|easy to install
B002T4U3Q6|5|Exactly what my husband wanted.
B007VXTRLC|5|Very easy to install, looks great and easy to use.
B004AIDBZO|5|Fixed my problem of my 05 Silverado going into 4-Hi by itself. Took about 45min to install and I left the front drive shaft on.
B001GN0XDO|4|The key chain is a handsome and suitable accent for the Jeep brand.
B00XXO19XC|4|This key chain is nice and very well constructed.  My V key fob looks great on it!!
B00HTP8N0I|4|Good and simple product.  Used for two trips transporting my Harley V-Rod.
B00K56PMIE|3|Nice quality and it's cute, but it does not really fit a Honda Civic window even though it says it does.  It is a bit too small for the window and falls over a lot. Would be great for a car that it fits.
B003BM5LUI|4|As much as I love my anchor buddy they only seem to last a couple of seasons before the surgical tubing core that allows it to retract fails and you wind up with a rogue boat on a loose anchor line. Not for overnight or un-attended mooring, perfect for anchoring off of shore where you will hanging out on the beach to watch it.
B00AJ31K0C|5|good price
B00K8VQE7Y|5|Awesome!
B0081KM6N0|1|Purchased 2. Not bright at all. Had to return them.
B004ULYR5Y|1|Too big, cheap material.
B000H2W270|5|Good range. Holds well on the roof at 80+mph.
B0064N1IG2|5|Exactly as described, authentic Preval brand, exactly like you get from buying the whole kit. Always convenient to have extra jars to keep left over product in.
B0009OMY9C|5|Works as intended....
B000FG8B32|4|Nice lights though not as many leds as what picture shows. Lights are very bright. Pleased. Photo needs to be updated.
B00BL0P8IC|4|Nothing fancy, but a solid extra helmet to keep around.
B003V9TC10|4|I use these on my 20' equipment trailer as the tire valves on it do not stick out far enough past the hub caps.
B0031B4YU2|4|like the towels just keep in mind next time... wash them before use. gets all the little fuzzballs off first. thank you!
B000BYGJQY|5|Ok,on time good .thanks!
B004CMMFK0|5|smells great.  lasts for couple days.
B0066R9ZX4|5|Ok on time good.thanks!
B0000AZ6WB|5|Just installed on my trailer. Looks like it will do the job. Well priced.
B001C8WP84|5|Installed them on the truck, the truck stops, no noise.
B001FIDNGO|5|Amazingly simple.  When I bought them I thought I would need to make a starter hole with a nail.  I was pleasantly wrong.  These slide right thru the belt fabric, without damaging the seatbelt in the least.  I highly recommend them.
B001JT77BG|3|Works for what it is intended to do.
B010R32L3I|5|This product works great!  It is very easy to use and you will be amazed by the shine.  It is such a small investment for excellent results.  I love that you can buy CARSHOW1 in a kit.  I would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to everyone.
B00RM327NG|5|Very sturdy and the magnet is strong! I bought one for myself and 5 more for my family and friends! Love it!
B0067ECZ9M|3|Works just fine, but I wish K&N offered a filter for Ford Explorer with the welded nut on the end. That's half the reason I buy K&N filters.
B00FGR8Y4G|1|These mirrors are too small and have no angle to them and they stand almost straight up. They looked ridiculas on the bike so I installed them and removed them imediatley.
B00XAS4W80|5|These really get the job done. The siphons are easy to use and powerful. The 3 pack makes it easy for various different uses.
B00CMVECOA|2|I bought this mirror for my my 1998 F250 LD Lariat, to replace one that I tore off on a branch that was sticking out on a very over grown dirt road. The price was Great!! The mirror looks great cosmetically. The gloss black cover on the back matches very close to the factory black paint on my truck, but the fitment is a little sloppy. There is about a 1/4 inch gap at the bottom of the mounting surface of the mirror, and nothing that I do can fix it. and the mirror seems to rattle a bit more than I like. But the main reason for giving it 2 stars is, the turn signal already stopped working for no reason.
B00KTJ0A0C|5|Received both keyless fobs...downloaded programming instructions from vendor site..Easy to program..Both work like a charm. I think I paid like 70 bucks for my previous replacement...so this is a great deal!
B00EC0YZ1E|5|Worked perfect for me.
B000OCKJJG|5|works as designed. no problems.
B0032FORFO|2|did not come with the white cover over the red lens, a nightmare. vendor say's you have to buy the whole unit. GREAT for three times what I paid for the lens........
B00JXYEVJA|5|I was quoted nearly a $1000 by a local auto shop to replace the system but with the help of my local Jiffy Lube to evacuate and recharge the system I spent less than $300 total and a half a day of my time. The kit installed as advertised and was an exact replacement. Everything needed was included in the kit.  It has been running for four days so far and working well. I live in Phoenix and I was getting 50 degree cold air on a 108 degree day the day I installed it.. Today it will be 112 degrees!!
B0032Y91B0|5|wonderful
B004MUI7OA|5|Fit so nice in the fuel tank.  Plugged right in and has been working great.
B00SISKX58|4|Met y expectations
B00537FR08|5|fits snug
B00KMP8OC4|5|Item as described even though it stated it wouldn't fit my 2011 VW jetta SE it fit perfect across the top inside of my rear window very happy with the product
B003OZWPA6|5|Just like the spray, these are great cleaning your glasses.  I keep them right on my desk.
B000ELP7Y4|5|works well so far and half the price of pep-boys same number.
B00QY8OGHK|5|i really needed this item, it works as described & was a perfect fit
B00LB7UYZC|3|I like these but the material is very thin and will tear easily........I only need them to protect my seats from my dogs hair, ect....but is not for people that need protection from children.........rough handling.........I use them for my Jeep to keep dirt and hair off the original seats.
B004SKJ4Z0|3|For the price they aren't bad, They rest on my cheek so when I take them off it looks like i've been hit in the face.
B002VKABU6|5|Good stuff
B003CMKHT2|1|What a rip off. All I got was a package of four 4's. Tell me you don't read the description and think that you are getting a pack of 1 - 9's. Description says &#34;Dirt Digits Competition Stick-On 5 1/2in. Black Number - 4 DD53B-4&#34; Like I'm suppose to know that 4 DD53B-4 means I'm just getting the 4 only. Should be more obvious.
B00Y3J485C|4|The turn signals look good and work great.
B00ZS9RWZE|5|AOK!
B00VDQNELW|5|Works great, keeps from burning my arm in the summer..........my dog sits on it while we drive.........works great for protection of the original texture
B00CNI1SDA|5|My leather couch is shiny and smooth after use.
B00XKJPA9E|4|Work really nice
B00MOKLRS8|5|Nice product and lined up with my Silverado perfect. Instructions and Mounting hardware made the installation easy!  I had them mounted in 45 minutes.  Thanks
B00UG2QYSY|5|Works great so far (1 month) on my crew cab truck.
B008971VOK|4|The only think I disliked about it was that it had some scuff marks on it and there are no covers for the bolts to make it look just as nice.
B003D3TKNY|5|No problems with this order.  Fast service and great product.
B000QDHENM|5|good
B000S2SS3Q|5|Fits my 2002 Chevy Avalanche Z66!
B00E59LDK8|1|When I went to put this on I noticed that is was very easy to bend. The end where the quick connect goes was no where near the size needed. I had to cut the end of the quick connect off and slide the hose over for it to work. Within a week it had a hole on one of the bends.
B00SH4LUNM|5|It looks so cute! I LOVE IT!
B002UJVNFA|5|Fit nice on your face. Don't fall of when on the bike
B00BN44DAA|5|It was all that I expected it was a a gift for my husband.  He loved it.
B00192KZQ2|5|Works well, as advertised.
B00G9AFQSQ|5|This is fit to 2012 Honda Accord LX. You can find some replacement videos on youtube. It's not that difficult to replace them.
B00CFB9M06|5|Very good
B00EB40FPQ|5|works very well and extends all the way to the corners.
B007RW3KJM|5|Received the shipment earlier than expected. Installed it 1 month ago and didn't see any issues with it.
B0080HJL7S|5|This product lives up to it’s claims.  Works well, leakproof (i checked), and is easy to install and remove to clean.  Velcro lid stays closed when needed and opens easily.  I personally like colour so wished it came in some more colour options but overall I am very satisfied with it. - item received as part of promo for review
B001UC3BQW|5|Cover and gasket worked great
B00K3SMDYA|4|A lot of flexibility and great knee protection.
B001C6N7ME|5|perfect
B001CEG90I|5|Works as advertised. Fits my 2010 RAV4.
B000IBDIX2|1|Holy hell this stuff is worthless. The chemicals are already pretty much watered down lemon juice and the &#34;sealer&#34; is a thin coating of low quality latex.... do not buy.
B005OZNZD0|5|Fast delivery and it worked perfectly. Note: You need two working keys in order to program the key yourself. I had two. I first went to Lowe's to get it cut and found that they couldn't, or wouldn't cut it, so I went to my local hardware store and they not only cut it, but didn't even charge me to do so. The programing is super simple!
B00DQ4TJUO|4|Considering the high price, I would just say this shade is okay, but not great.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Fits the windshield well. Often do not need to use visors to hold in place. Although there are some small gaps on the sides and around the rear view mirror.<br />- Seems thick and sturdy. Should last a long time<br />- Easy and fast to remove from the windshield and fold up<br /><br />CONS<br />- Harder to put in place than to remove. You kind of have to learn which approach angle to use in order for the side flaps to make it over the dash. You also have to have it slightly folded so that the flaps can make it inside of the pillars.<br />- When folded it is still very long, making it awkward to stow if you are carrying passengers.<br />- The &#34;reflective&#34; material seems to absorb more heat than it reflects. I wish it was shinier to keep more heat outside.<br /><br />Overall, I would say this is a great item for protecting your dash from UV rays. It could be easier to put in place, and it should be shinier.
B0071H4DW6|5|Exactly what I needed and the perforated top keeps the head from over heating 10/10
B0039OX1UA|3|Look carefully at the pics to see what nuts are included.  If yours broke where mine did, there is a key part missing with this replacement.
B009DJX46G|5|Perfect fit, no issues
B00DTEDKK6|5|Works great, great sound, no problem hearing phone and gps. Radio is the only thing that is not  the best.  But I really care , that is not what I got its for.
B00NPIUFMM|4|Perfect fit look great way brighter than the halogen bulbs
B0009V1WQQ|5|An added sense of security for my motorcycle as a deterrent against thieves/vandals
B000EVYI4E|5|I am building a new instrument panel for my 65 F 100 the equus gauges look g reat on the polished diamond plate
B00FEAOCHI|5|This helmet is awesome.<br />Was a bit tight. Folded my ears down when putting it on. But after about 2 months it finally broke it and is the single best bang for your buck.  Awesome helmet. The wind noise is more of a lower frequently rather than a squeal in my last helm. So much nicer. It feels small and compact. Light on my neck. Has spots for speakers. I can't ask for anything better for the $40 I paid.
B001DRNNGW|3|addition of moisture barrier made the fit a little snug and question whether it may have collapsed filter cartridge.
B000B6JJUK|5|Best electronic Tire Gauge I've every purchased. Easy to use too!
B0000AXRH5|5|It's a funnel. It works.
B007TYC06W|1|Seats have already begun wearing and haven't even been in the car for more than 3 months, customer service from Solo Performance Specialties couldn't have been any worse, I would like the driver's seat either replaced or for the company to pay for the seat to be reupholstered. I'm actually wondering if these seats are even Genuine Corbeau Seats considering how quickly they have worn down. They have been regularly cleaned for at least once a week every week, and are usually sat in for approximately 1 hour a day.
B003SS62PS|5|Love this little fan. Bought it as I have an Expedition and the back air conditioner broke before our summer road trip. Bought this to circulate the air conditioning from the front to the back. Works GREAT. Kept my 16 month old son and go cool. Also it oscillates which is also awesome.
B00QYIGJ5W|1|Doesn't work wired my own harness
B00RVYN0U0|5|Great stickers, Great price<br />shipping takes awhile
B00EK5B3K2|5|Better than I expected great product great price and on time delivery would recommend to all my friends
B000C55L3E|3|seam to be weak.
B000EH4V0Y|5|Just what I needed. Works great for exact measurement.
B00L331ZM0|5|Easy to install and look awesome.
B001DUIUZS|1|Made in china part, same as the $12 eBay ones, thrown in a Beck Arnley box, looks nothing like the picture. Installed DEC 2013, total failure by Jan 2015. Buy an OEM one, they are only $44 online.
B00JAHENU2|5|Worked amazing!
B00D5DOK50|5|Excellent
B004FOK2UU|5|It was perfect and I received it promptly!
B000QCM28U|5|A interesting bumper sticker, promptly delivered.
B004PE16I2|5|Good case to store the camera in.
B005CXL1J4|5|Excellent product as described.  This fits my 2004 Yamaha Vstar perfectly.
B000CQOIVO|1|Poor quality.  Loose tolerances in the swivel cause the jack to be wobbly.  Unsafe to use.
B009VYWIMO|5|Great camera works perfect
B001U31TME|5|The fragrance is not too strong or offensive.
B00QY8N91Y|3|Fits like a glove. But I'm not to happy with the texture of the silicon. Could be the humidity though, as I do live in South East Asia
B00MEEU4F6|5|Worked perfect!
B000CO9FF0|5|GREAT
B00DQJB9K2|3|Bought this because the antenna my new 2015 Frontier is too tall for my garage and drags against the ceiling of my garage. Looks good and was very easy to install, but I'm starting to become concerned about it damaging the area if a bird/debris would fly into it because it's so rigid.  Also, after a trip through the local car wash the spinning brushes get right up on it and seemed to loosen the antenna.  Probably should have just gotten a shorter traditional antenna instead of the solid shorty.  This would be great for a vehicle who's antenna is centered in the rear, but my truck it's in the front on the passenger side.  Will probably replace with a more flexible option.
B00ACDP6YU|4|Installed on a 9hp back hoe trencher. Easy to setup and works great.
B0100KSILW|4|I purchased 1 and i loved it so much that i purchased 2 more. i gave it 4 stars because it has no grip.
B003UQDMJC|2|I was disappointed when I received my order of the rear mats. I thought it was a set, which would be two mats but I only received one. I also ordered front mats and it came as a pair. Very deceiving...I had to order another mat and had to pay $10.00 in shipping on top of price.
B00BDQ4BNM|4|awesome works great fit perfect
B00T8UY53Q|5|Excellent lights. Great quality. Love them
B0000AYBTO|5|I like the Camco Pop-A-Plate very much, and it is a very good space saver in the kitchen.
B007FTV9Q8|3|Print is different from the picture but that's ok. It's still nice and durable.
B00TP8FVK2|5|I ordered this kit and it came very quickly(3 or 4 days). I started what I thought was going to be a complicated install in my wheel wells. Once I got started the installation was a breeze.It was a lot easier to do this install with the tires off and my truck on a lift.  I had very few issues besides a slight wiring issue, but it was easily fixed and I began to glow. As I took it down the road that night you could tell it was a real head turner. I had a small crowd at the gas station when I stopped to get gas in amazement. Needless to say I would buy 10 more of these and would recommend them to all my friends.
B00CD2RBWS|4|Great fit and work well!
B007I6K4I2|1|This item didn't work and when I returned it I only got about half the purchase price credited to me. I purchased a new starter from a reputable dealer and the mower started just fine. I don't recommend purchasing this product from this seller.
B001BDSVOM|5|worked great
B000CIXMIC|5|Looks sturdy. Appears better made than original.
B00EX9OPPK|4|These hinges fit and matched the old hinges perfectly.  Appear to be of equal quality.  They don't come with replacement plastic washer/spacer.   But easily picked those up at the local store.
B00CS6MCKA|5|It got here just as it was stated installed it and the A/C kicked on like brand new.
B009T4REQG|4|Needs a lock down button on it. Works good other than that.
B0071F2NJI|5|It was a perfect fit.
B000RN04VU|4|This bag is like a large soft lunch box with side pockets.  It is easy to install on a NC700X and looks good.
B00480GYSA|3|The light is a tad bit dim
B002SAW2W4|4|FYI it won't fit if y'all have the Bull bar.
B00NOA8NCU|2|Did not get the life that I expected to get out of them. I purchased on May 31 2015 and 2 of the main leds have gone out in only 2 months. I expected at least a year for the price that I paid.
B00NEU440K|5|Worked great. Loved the velcro.
B0006IX7Y2|4|Not bad and works real well and is worth its money
B00K2DULJU|5|Yep
B00ELR43CO|5|Worked out great!
B0000AX5X5|5|Bought these for the kids to use on the sxs...no complaints and they worked great
B000EFCPMC|4|As an artist, I was looking for a genuine sheepskin leather chamois, to use for smudging & blending pastels and graphite. I received my Detailer's Choice Genuine Leather Chamois in good time, however, nowhere on the packaging does it say genuine sheepskin,as appears on the Amazon description. Since this is my first chamois, I have nothing to compare it to and so, I have no idea if it's sheepskin or not. It was very soft when I opened it and is genuine leather. However, after the initial washing and drying as per instructions, there was a rough patch approx. 2&#34; x 5&#34;. Also, on examination, there was a very thin patch ( semi translucent) in the middle of it, approx 2&#34; in diameter. I scrunched up the dry chamois to make it soft and pliable again, but will avoid using the rough patch since I fear it will not give me the smooth effect I'm looking for in my blended pastel work.<br />I will probably buy this brand again, since it is a nice large genuine chamois for the price, and I assume that the rough patch and the semi translucent spot both have to do with the skin used and the tanning process. It probably can't be 100% perfect, since it's natural and not synthetic.
B010VUZL0M|4|Works fine the only bad thing is the rubber smell
B00CCYWJQK|4|I had to exchange it a couple times because the<br />quick release is an issue.<br />the product is a great product once you get one that works
B000EEU0IO|1|It did not work for me, I placed that on my car driver seat .
B00KWMKTZM|4|Three of four rubber mars received in excellent condition. Hover forth mat on front drivers has a rolled CONDITION that in one months use still will not lay flat. This is an appearance and function CONDITION..Advised manufacture better than two weeks ago about above with no reply received to date.
B00D36A17A|4|These are great floormats and last a good amount of time. But you get what you pay for. These last a good 3-4 months before they need replacing in my daily driver. The have lasted 6 1/2 months so far in my Grandpas mustang and still look brand new, but he only uses it maybe 10 times a month.
B006CRT72W|5|Product was as described and on time. But would have liked better instructions to program the remote to the factory keyless system. Step 1 open door. Step 2 press unlock button, Step 3 close door. Then follow instructions as listed.
B00JSJMV38|5|Love this. Fits nice and tight. I have a 2012 Kia Rio
B005ZFEB6E|5|GREAT MATS
B00BYVWHN2|5|excellent
B003WDDLTO|5|Length is just right for my bike
B002TJSS2C|5|Works great.  I feel much better knowing my 7 yr. old is protected.
B000E267RO|4|A little alignment necessary, however cant beat the quality and price.
B0040CTYAQ|5|Perfect.
B00OQPRPK8|5|The organizer is very sturdy and good quality, just wished the strap were 1 inch longer which will give more room for adjustment.
B00H6XPZN6|4|Works well needs to have a seperate little pouch for suction cups
B000CSZJ38|4|worked as expected.
B000XECJES|5|Perfect!
B000C57M8Q|5|as advertised
B001G6MOG0|5|just fine
B00D8I6A4Q|5|Love it!
B00SVEQPRE|1|Buy this and you look like a tool as the flag is draped incorrectly
B00THMP908|5|Amazing easy to apply and boldly displays my pride of my son and his commitment to our community. Many car washes later and still like the day applied. Worth every bit of the cost and really reasonable. A five star purchase from AMAZON.COM.
B00FY80P44|5|work great best price you will find for this part.
B007I7D66S|5|excelent
B00GJJ088U|5|As advertised. I fixed my problem easily.
B00WAL9AEE|5|product had good delivery, product was as advertised
B00FFAXNJA|3|It had a bent flange but I was able to repair it. Needs better packing.
B00D2QL0DU|4|good purchase
B00E018CKU|5|Came quick and well packed. Looks good and loud i will update when installed.
B00BCH51ZO|5|love it!
B009J3L4RM|5|They are longer than stock size bulbs, but these are very bright. They are my reverse lights. I can't stand behind the vehicle and look at them even during the day. Love them.
B004I8M03K|1|No , the drivers lens was defected and originals were already gone  Doesn't do any good to return if that's how they're made now.
B00SZK1420|1|Did not fit my vehicle
B00029WYEY|5|Good product
B00HQ70UUU|3|Motor is identical to stock motor. Doesnt come with any mounting hardware. But easily replaceable. You can find youtube videos on how to do this ....replaced the faulty one in a 2002 chevy s10. That fact it doesnt come with amy bolts, nuts, wiring harness is the only reason i gave it 3stars. Havent gotten around to changing it , cant tell you how the operation works.
B003CG9QFY|5|Requires a bit of time to install, but overall pretty easy. Took 1 hour with me drilling pilot holes and adjusting. Adds a decent look and extra storage. Top left screw hole is off in the pic.
B00RKHQY1K|5|Excellent product. I love how it has a pocket. I use it to put my recyclable bags in to remind me to bring them into the store.
B005WR2KVS|1|These are not Audi manufactured (Brand) as indicated. These are made by Visonter. Don't buy if looking for legitimate Audi parts.
B00VDQNELW|5|Fit perfectly on our 2014 Wrangler Sahara.
B008PO6368|1|Worthless product, both cans clogged and wouldn't work at all.
B00NTVMHLM|3|They look good aesthically, but the ones I received the gas pedal rubber insert did not fit correctly, it was cut too short so would not stay on the aluminium piece which then clipped onto the pedal. I see they may not stand up to the test of time, but for the price worth a short. I returned mine for the gas pedal issue. Looks like it would fit a 2012 VW Passat TDI, but I wasn't too impressed with the fitment of the pedal covers.
B0002Z9L7G|2|Doesn't stay on.
B0084O11YI|5|Love it.
B004K9D2O8|5|Looks and works great. Quality OEM product.
B00JC7Y80K|1|Color not even close
B00SX6Z2L0|1|hoses would not attach properly i returned it
B00PAEDFSU|1|Cheap made welds keep brakeing
B000GZTASW|5|ECXELENTE
B0082365AQ|5|Yes the tire smell right out of the box. That aside this is the ideal cart with high value. No flimsy axle, kick stand and all. Only complaint is the plastic tie down snaps are cheap and cannot take the necessary tension. Easy to replace and you are off
B002JBVKMK|5|Fits perfectly looks like the original equipment. .
B00T47K604|1|Didn't fit my seat belt connection
B0073IJ6KM|5|Better than I expected as it was a Chevy product!
B00KWGJGSY|5|The product arrived, and using the proper plug puller tool to remove the plug cap -- which breaks easily, by the way -- together with a deep 12mm socket, the glow plug is easy to install. The fault code disappeared in half a day and my check engine light went out on its own (I have a bluetooth OBDII adapter that allows me to read and clear codes, which I didn't use after the plug installation because I wanted to see if the fault code would expire on its own) and hasn't come back on. The plug is ridiculously expense though cheaper on Amazon from Fowler, and the problem is over. I might add as a 2010 VW Jetta TDI owner, who also swapped out the rear O2 sensor the same week, I'm disappointed to have to replace these parts after only 65k miles. That's why Consumer Reports gives this otherwise brilliantly styled and performing car only &#34;average&#34; for reliability. Oh well. Now my car's efficiency and pep is back.
B004AJFCMI|5|These attach easily to the Westin winch mount and are very strong.
B0040D2TGG|5|These work great and are a much better design for removing than the OEM part.
B004AR12EW|4|Parts worked perfectly!
B000VKTULY|5|This filter fit my Corolla just fine.  Looked like the filter that came out.  PeP Boys wanted the bargain price of $20 to change it.  I hear dealers will charge much more than that.  Takes 5 minutes or less to do it yourself using only a phillips screwdriver.  If you have never done it before, U-Tube has videos that show the filter being changed.  The biggest inconvienience is having to clean out the glove compartment,  mine needed a little attention anyway.
B00DJ2BO5Q|5|Perfect fit
B003SG431U|3|Not bad! Dont exactly fit my seats perfectly, but close enough for use.
B000EVYGZA|5|Product came as described. Very happy with this purchase.
B00WPBNNWE|4|I have the 2015 RAV 4 LTD - it will work with this trim, just need to place it in carefully so it aligns properly
B00CEH0L4M|5|This is the 'go to' spark plug for BMWs, especially the E39 version. These were a great price for someone in Canada.
B00YQG1NQE|5|perfect replacement
B0010E1LYY|5|A perfect fit.
B001THQX1S|4|My customer was very satisfied.
B001LHVOVK|5|Accurate and easy to use.
B00YE5Q0Q0|5|I was AMAZED!!!  My 2nd car is an 01 Volvo s60 . It sat all winter & got plowed in , so I couldn't  move or use it for months til the spring thaw! Well, when I did try to use it, &#34; nothing&#34;- not even a CLICK -click click. Ughh. Now, a Volvo has it's battery located in the trunk under bolts etc for some stupid reason! So to jump it you have to use a positive bolt from the fuses under the hood & ground the neg to a bolt ( really annoying) . Well the way I was parked, I couldn't really get another car close enough & cables weren't reaching! A friend gave me xtra long ones, only to find that they had splits in them & wouldn't work! Good cable are expensive! & you need to call someone or ask a stranger to jump you! Which isn't always possible or SAFE as a young woman!  Well I was asked to review this & thought &#34; why not, it probBly WONT start my car, but good for my laptops, iPads etc. &#34;. Well I just went outside ( after it sat DEAD from February !) & thought I'd try it before I called my roadside ass.. I took a video with my iPhone. I put it on the positive nut & a bolt to ground the neg. It was silly easy. I pressed the button to make sure it was charging all the way. I got in & NOTHING? :(  BUT WAIT!!!  I thought it has sat for over 6 months dead, I checked the connection, I had the neg on loose & as soon as I reconnected it- I heard my interior bell dinging!!!!!! Omg I thought?! I got in & tried it again & she started right up! I was so HAPPY I looked like a crazy person ( okay I do that a lot anyhow!) . I could not believe this little portable battery charger started my old Volvo after it was completely DEAD for 6 1/2 months! I will never be without this again! Well worth the money , PLUS all the other things it does! STRONE LITE, SOS SIGNAL LIGHT, BRIGHT FLASH LIGHT , RED CAUTION LED LIGHTS ( side of road break down, in need of help..), Charger a multitude of devices with every attachment you could possible need to fit what you need charged. It had a car charger, wall charger, USB charger. It also comes in a well built zippered case that fit it & all the cords, plugs, cables to jump etc in neatly & secure. I'm a hard to please &#34; reviewer&#34;! My last 2  items from a company , well the asked me &#34;PLEASE don't  review the other ( 3rd item) they sent! Lol as I did not like the products, they weren't made right, sorced correctly & the organic stamp was questionable. I look into companies , I tell it like it is, FREE or NOT!! I give reviews to help other shoppers make a better buying choice as I want when I read reviews. Honest, real ppl, that don't say everything is &#34; AWESOME 5 stars, I love it!&#34;  , ughh .<br /> Not everything is great, or even good, we all know that. But I was really surprised with the quality , the customer service ( they contacted me to ask if I had any questions & were there if needed)  & that it STARTED MY COMPLETELY DEAD BATTERY IN MY CAR WITHIN 2 mins.!<br /> I highly recommend this! I am getting 2 more at least! My other car, my Mothers car,  I don't want to be without this . Ever!<br /> It was provided to me , & I was asked to give a review. But I could've said &#34; it sucks!&#34;  They have no control over your review!<br />I really, honestly love this & will pay for 2 more now that I have tried it.<br /> Hope I can load the video? I'm so not tech savvy!  That's another thing about this item- VERY easy to figure out & USE!<br /> I hope this helps someone , that's what reviews are for.<br />Thank you,<br />Jenna car charger, wall charger, USB charger.

B00EOTVEA8|2|Great product.
B0009H528E|5|fit right on like it should
B000EDUUH6|3|This is more for a camper and not a home screen door but there were none in hardware stores and on line that were available, so this has to do to protect my screen from being damaged.
B00M8UHSX2|5|I have these on my '12 JKUR and love it.  I always rest my leg on the rock rail and not anymore.  I can enjoy sitting back and kicking it while driving topless and doorless
B00IQ2Z0D6|5|It has helped me keep my car battery charged.
B002SA0Y3I|5|Perfect fit...fast delivery
B002UC2Q0S|5|Consistently JR products like the ones I purchased here outperform anything else on the market. I have a 2008 Frontier Explorer and these replaced the plastic junk nicely. Thank you again!
B008D3HQMG|1|where broken when got
B001EDK0WK|5|Good product
B00CCIM1YQ|5|Heavy duty and feels like quality built. Use it to lock up my road bike for long periods at a time.
B00JBNYYQ8|1|Scratches remain.
B001HBZPHE|5|Awesome product
B005SEJTYG|5|only way to go full royal purple oil change got 3 to 4 miles more to gal
B009DJVTDG|5|This grill is nice. Gave my truck a much better appearance than the old one I replaced.<br />Easy installation. Nice upgrade for the price.
B0000AY4MK|5|Saves scratches on my bumper
B007LICSBS|5|Looks good on my rv.  Just remember make sure you have four screw holes.  The price is right.  Much more inexpensive than the brick and mortar stores and alot better quality.
B0018MV7OM|5|Installed 4 of these over the last 4 years and work about a year and break at the exact same place the original broke. Lasts maybe 2 years then cracks down the middle.
B0089FHERA|4|its a little thinner than i expected.
B005DN3D58|5|A++
B0023VL4DQ|5|Just as advertised. Very easy to install.
B00E1SLFDS|4|Works great, Great Product
B0094BFGG4|4|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!  That should say it all!  I have regular straps and realized I couldn't take my board with me anywhere, as it could be stolen in seconds.  Got these and now I can take it anywhere and not worry.  Have left it in an Outlet parking lot all day while away and it was still there when I returned.  I was struggling with them and thought I'd have to return them, as one of them wouldn't lock - watched a video about them and realized you have to pull up on the silver part once you have them tightened -they both lock and unlock easy once I got this down.  The keys are flimsy though so took one star off for that --- bent one of them locking it and they only send you 2 keys. The keys are important enough that i feel they should be solid. Also, i got the short ones, 8 foot i think, get the next biggest size if you want to carry lock 2 boards- i definitely can't lock more than one board to my car - which I am bummed about.  Great overall!
B003PODJ1A|5|Raised the back end about 1inch.
B000BR1Q6Y|5|I love it -- it is ok
B001F02NCW|5|my husband loves he eagle cover thank you.
B00ENALR14|5|All was good. Thanks you!
B000ZMI596|4|Good product. Received it quickly. Submission process did not have order or message confirmation which made order a bit of a mystery. I would have expected an email confirmation of order and plate text.
B00880D8YY|4|I don't like carrying keys in my pocket so I have worn them on a belt clip most of my life. I have always used strong but utilitarian clips which look a little out of place on dress trousers.<br />I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It is quite attractive and looks appropriate for wearing with a business suit.The build quality seems very good.
B00SI6NST8|1|It's already started to fall apart, the rubber gripper needles are breaking off and the mats do not stay in place.  They are somewhat hazardous since the mats move around.  I'm sorry to have thrown my old mats away from Ford/Mercury, even though they had a hole in the driver's side at least they didn't slip around.
B00PLD64ZQ|5|Worked perfectly; glad to have the right tools.
B008KWP6MC|4|easy to install
B002NJ78DI|5|very good product. works well
B00009K762|2|Gave as gift thought it was to put stuff in but it just to hold stuff against back of vehicle (that could have been my misunderstanding and not knowing the difference)
B004WNFPR4|5|Great product
B000KKLLX0|5|Worked as it should in my 2012 Silverado. Good inexpensive product.
B00V56U28I|3|It does freshen things up, but if you have an odor in your car you're still going to need an air freshener well at least for older cars.  There's also a buzzing sound, though it's not noticeable if you have on music, otherwise it sounds like a mosquito
B004SSAF5K|1|If you live anywhere  that does not have sun or rain or if you keep your car in a underground bunker and want to save it from dust then they may be the cover for you.
B004646QYK|5|Works as expected.  Like the product.
B00BB0TGS0|4|As far as the quality and use it is a great product! But the assembly is a giant pain in the ass!
B003FCNX2C|4|Couldn't use.
B00JVHLS3G|1|Turned yellow after the first wash.
B00RNDB2W2|5|Came early  always good
B002P8QUB8|5|Easy to install works great
B00S1DQLK6|4|Works good.  Very happy with product.
B00681BE2S|1|did not work for my mustang
B00BVQ6YZM|5|I love it
B000VL607K|3|Not that good with performance
B000C9H44O|5|Items installed easy enough 2004 Yukon and work well so far into the couple thousand miles.  No noise and happy with the items
B00BTS28I4|5|Fits perfect and looks great !
B00168O4MK|5|If you own a truck and ya don't have some type of a beck rack. Then you don't use it for any type of working.
B00ZE1JMM2|5|I have been car shopping for the past month in a rush to buy something affordable but reliable. I was looking at cars at dealerships and from personal sellers. After a few cars I realized that a carfax alone will not protect me from purchasing a car that had some body work done to it. I heard about milPro from a friend and decided to buy it as well. Best investment made! I came into the dealership and as soon as I took it out the dealer said &#34;Why didn't you tell me that youre a dealer!?&#34; and was completely honest with which areas were previously damaged and also knocked the price off. I ended up going with a different car from a personal seller because I was now comfortable knowing that the car is in a good condition. Not only did it help me get a great car but also helped me get it cheaper! Thanks!
B00NJU7ENO|3|For build quality 5 stars!! but manual was made by idiot, pictures up side down, completely unreadable printed probably on XIX century printed machine. I wasted my time to locate mounting place in my Nissan Rogue. With professional installation manual this product deserves 5 stars.
B00RVST2B2|5|Once my wife figured out what the word Infidel meant she refused to drive the car for 3 months.  It was fantastic.  It's tough living with a religious woman sometimes when you're an atheist.<br /><br />The sticker itself is easy to apply, looks great and says exactly what I want it to as a secular veteran.<br /><br />Fits above the Toyota emblem on the back window of my Prius nicely.
B00EU7C0UC|1|Will not work on tanks that have any old liner still inside. Does not tell you that on the box or the instructions.<br />Only in tiny print on can. Coverage looks ok down the filler. I however can open a large panel and look inside. Coverage is a joke. Northern suggested I thin with acetone. After the fact. The instructions on the box don't mach the instruction sheet inside. And that docent match the printing on the can. Waste of money and time.
B00KTIC2ZE|5|Fit Perfectly, and has held up very well. Also, the color is very nice.
B00OFTFW8C|5|Great product for a very reasonable price. Looks as good or better than what Harley offers.
B00BTLEJAQ|1|Worst product I've ever purchased. Amazon said it would fit my exact car, and it didn't. Let alone that the material it's made out of is cheap. You can synch a strap with out it breaking and can't even get it to fit any seat remotely. Always has baggy parts. Would not buy again what so ever.
B006UYO7LI|5|This item was just what I needed, it fits my 12 Highlander base model WITHOUT the auto lift gate. This item is for the models again, without power lift gate. Also, I was looking for others to mention this but no one did so I will just in case someone else was wondering. This cover DOES store into the same compartment the factory cover stores in. Great product!
B002R1NDUE|5|Wonderful product and wonderful service.
B0007OWD2M|5|Best product ever, there is a reason they call it invisible glass! Learned about this product from a friend and this is now what I turn to for every glass cleaning need.
B000CMFEBQ|5|Very happy with my light covers. Could have been a little cheaper, but i think everything cost too much. Lol
B00EUUNJRM|5|One word...... Damn.  Just. Damn. This thing is stupid bright
B0063CU6GM|5|good
B002VVO1CY|4|I put this on my 2013 Kawasaki Vulcan VN900 Custom.  Easy to install and looks nice on the bike.  Does a good job deflecting the wind.
B00AY29VFO|1|Installed the new alternator in my car with no issues whatsoever. Drove around for 10 min before car died. Had it brought to a mechanic that said it was a bad part. Cheap alternator, get what you pay for
B006WPQNB2|5|We got this for use on a pontoon.  This has been a life saver on several occasions.  It is a great size, not too low to the ground for us older people.  Very easy to use.
B00NP60URE|5|This item works on any car or truck it's nicely made it checks for vacuum leaks and bleeds your brakes it save money if u do it your self it cost me 25.99 free s.h with order over like 35.00 vary well made great product it comes with ever thing u need to do the job pulse a nice case thank u
B00KTIUID2|5|thanks
B00NNDNUFI|5|I have a 2005 Nissan Sentra that had starter issues. The car would crank but wouldn't turn over. I read countless forms online that suggested the issue being the fuel pump. Many of them suggested changing the fuel assembly pump and stated that soldering was needed in order to connect the wiring harness. Upon receiving my order and installing it I was very much satisfied that everything went smooth and easy and no soldering was required. The part was easy to install and was the solution needed to fix the car.
B0002SQUFY|5|Right Tool for the Job.
B00NQUWY00|5|Good prices and product - no complaint
B000C9Q43G|5|fit great
B00BC328F4|5|I worried that something in the paint color wouldn't match because of the metal flake color.<br />But the paint matched exactly. I was very pleased. I would recommend this product to a friend.<br />Thank you so much.
B000C5WE34|5|Still working like new, fit like the one that came on the car
B003S62WNG|5|good fit and good price
B00A00LTKA|5|Very pleased with the Weathertech cargo liner.  It fits my 2014 Escape perfectly.  Certainly lives up to the Weathtech good name.<br />.
B005C2ASRQ|5|perfect

B0002NILZQ|5|Awesome!
B004YJW95M|5|better than others. cheaper as well
B000E28C7M|5|Easy to install. Will be much easier to remove than stock filter was. That's the main reason I purchased, ease of removal in the future.
B000GRS2G6|5|bought for my father for his harley! he loves it it fits well and is a great material!! super fast shipping from seller
B000CFNBQI|4|works good

B004HCS4NW|5|Worked great
B007HRHM6O|5|Used this items on two of the storage compartments on my 5th wheel travel trailer.  Just peeled and cleaned off the old material and where is was going to replace it at with acetone and it has stuck great and made the compartments simple to use .  Great product for this purpose.
B00E58J8GK|5|Product was delivered within reasonable time and works as it should. Thank you
B00LEUR5QW|5|Did what it was supposed to.
B004I6H59G|5|this item is the perfect part. It did exactly what the ad said .
B00PJX549A|4|Great for full view.  Would be better if did not adjust as you have to re-adjust after every wash.
B001FAGJJK|4|Love it! put it on my JK grille and it looks great. Easy to install and clearly good quality.
B006SRAJK0|5|Perfect fit!
B00E63THQA|4|Love this waterbottle, keeps my beer cold at the beach. had the 40oz and loved it so got the 64oz. The only negative would be it's so thick I can barley pick it up with one hand. Other than that it's perfect!
B008G2LAI0|4|great fit and upgrade from faded ones
B00PYZVZFA|5|Well made . Good for long rides in cold weather.
B001OMEPEU|3|Had to remove the 3 metal tabs on the back and then shim it with rubber for it fit on my 66 Mustang. But in the end it works and with my HID lights.
B000F14CVW|5|This is the answer to a cracked dashboard problem.  My dashboard cracked in several places. We tried gluing g it but nothing worked it looked terrible. Now thankfully it looks perfect.  The mat fit wonderfully no more cracks at all. Beautiful!
B00WSUSCNM|1|my part number is 35750-SDA-A04. So I bought it, but I cannot program it. What can I do now?
B00480J4I2|5|I am looking to change my Lexus ES 350 2007 headlight but I founded its very expensive in agncy. I get form amazon less than agncy 60%. It's fit my car perfect.
B00RF2I8QO|5|nice
B003LD1MUU|1|1 positive- hubcaps look great on the van. 1 negative- hubcaps do not fit snug at all, lost one already on first day going down the road.  These were put on Ford factory rims.  Looking now for actual factory ones.
B004A6LASQ|5|fit great and great price
B002R1QLZS|5|Quick delivery and easy installation.
B000C06O8K|1|lucky I order all 4 ...both sets was misboxed... the front was in the rear boxes and the rear was in the front boxes
B007ZDGAQI|5|This is classy!

B002H56AYQ|5|great price
B002L7A370|5|Fit in my new grill. Good price. Same Aluminum other places is $38-48
B005JZTNLI|4|great quality, i use them to with the kids' child seat; make sure to determine the proper fit for your car before ordering though, not all car seat belts are the same.
B00REAPZCC|4|good light, great price. I read all the reviews and I was hesitant. I cant find any problems. Super bright and good distance of light beam
B002UC8MOC|5|Worked great for my RV. It was a direct replacement.
B00BLPPWWE|3|Love this, grabs everyone's attention. Only issue is that at night you are not able to see from afar. People would have to be very close to actually see the lights on the back if the vest.
B004IYC5HU|5|Fit perfectly
B00BSEZIQI|3|Great idea they worked great and i was hapoy saving the power consumption on my yacht and rv ,but over6 months time they dimmed in brightness maybe youll have better luck. I didnt request a replacment because of the effort findind my order info ,discusing the issue and possibly paying return shipping for an inwxpensive light bulb. One other issue it was a powerfull light bulb but led is a little harsher light than standard bulbs but when off the grid its worth the issud
B007JSGR9Y|4|works ok
B001V8U12M|5|Saves So much time
B00I2JHNR4|5|Identical to the OEM part in every way.
B0001EWW06|4|good warehouse deal one little scratch , went on great. thank you

B00ZY1MJ22|5|Love this item ots hot everyone  ask me where  i got it
B000WEMH4G|5|Good plug.  G\ood quality
B000VKTUJG|3|Cheaper then oem but fitment is not perfect. It will fit with a little effort.
B000WJLS5A|5|Great review mirror.
B00ZW66RXQ|5|Very bright light bulbs!! Highly recommended! Love them!
B00PT18QAQ|5|This thing is super accurate. Use it all the time at Autocross events. Bleeds well and gives you a large window to read small drops in PSI. Also durable, gets dropped and shoved around a lot at the events and have had no problem!! highly recommended
B00K03VFOC|5|The painter says this is a super nice spraygun. Used for waterborne basecoats, and he says the gun lays color down nicely.
B005MJYTYC|2|The back ripped after two months
B0050I0CN2|1|i took it to home depo but they dont cut keys returning it
B00NGIE1TE|5|This fits my 2014 Mustang and my 2014 Fiesta. It also fits a 2011 Ford Fusion. It works better than the oem Ford one that retails for more. Absolutely recommend this. Note: It only fits one way. Some who say it doesn't fit may have tried it backwards.
B00KO7NJYS|5|Works perfect in my s2000 turbo. No modifications needed to impact bar or condenser or dryer.
B000CIRAGM|5|Works great, light and multi-useful
B00D9C2CDO|4|We took an eight hour trip with our truck so packed down that I literally had my legs folded Indian style! Never again! I used this with our 2012 Nissan Pathfinder. Thanks to Amazon prime, I had it sent to our vacation condo and did not go home the same way we got there! This makes a much easier trip, especially with three crowded in kids!<br />Also, it did rain on us all the way home. This is definitely waterproof!<br />My reason for the four stars was because it's so hard to maneuver packing and unpacking while it's on the truck, I didn't think we could get it up there if we packed it first though!
B00GHT8TSI|4|Fit perfectly, easy to install. Looks like its the same as the OEM but lots cheaper $$ !!!
B003UANXCE|5|I've had several battery tenders in the past for my cars and now for my bikes. None of them had the ability to desulfate the battery. This one can try to save the battery.  It has saved 3 batteries that I would have had disposed.  Saved me money right there. Get this, the pig tails (to make it easy to put your bike on the tender, and their extension cord.
B001G6H9LK|5|Used this for the 1996 Infiniti g20 normal edition. I had a leaky Valve cover area, so I replaced it with this, then put on some RTV. (Permatex ultra grey or ultra black, I used black). The old cover was hard and brittle, while the new one was soft and flexible. Well no more leaks so it works great!<br /><br />Just note this kit is missing the one spark plug oring in the center of the Valve Cover, not too important but i'd order than part seperately if you want a complete change.
B006OQJLD6|1|I ordered the wrong size, sent it back.
B000VKTUD2|5|Saved me 40 dollars from replacing it at the dealer.  The install took about 3 minutes, and most of the time was unboxing the product and walking to my car to get this installed.  Will be buying this every year.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Nice to have something that can jump our boat, cell phones, and all the electronics needed on a day out on the lake.
B001KS2R34|5|Well worth the price and now my AC blows twice as hard. Couldn't believe that it was the filter all along.
B000GV977K|5|Looks great! Fits on my 05 dyna perfect. It came 2 days early, not saying yours will. I can ride for about 50 minutes before my butt start to hurt. For being a solo slim seat, the comfort level is better then others I have had. If your on the fence about this seat get it. You can't beat the price either. I will post picture later.
B00YMUQ5HG|5|Anchor works perfect for my 20' wakeboard boat. I am a beginner boater and was able to set the anchor on the 3rd try.
B005GNUOTS|1|A joke end of story.
B008FK5ZWA|3|The floor liner came on time as projected.  However, the fit was only mediocre.  Sand and dirt from my children's shoes still get stock behind the liner at times.  But it's a definite improvement over standard floor mats.
B0058J4LX0|5|As all WeatherTech mats are, this one is perfectly sized for our new Explorer.<br /><br />The only thing that would be cool is if there were a better way or place to store the mat when I want to use the 3rd row
B000BO71UC|5|Love them
B00S8KQ83C|5|Even has videos online to help you out if need be!
B000NBWCFC|5|/Did what it was supposed to do.  Great product at a great price.
B002IQ6332|1|Product doesn't say what color LED but be assured this is for the regular AMBER color. Don't be fooled by the product reviews, this seller does not sell any white LED sidemarkers.
B00LFL8B40|5|Bolted right on. Looks like decent quality also.
B0048EE2YO|2|Does not fit correctly in my 2004 Honda Odyssey.  Gray Mist color is ok match but the sizing is OFF.
B00CBC7EBI|1|The tape itself was fine but after cleaning the board with rubbing alcohol, letting it dry in the sun, and having a heavy set of books press on the installed tape it immediately started lifting off the board. Don't waste your money.
B00EA0ZB7I|3|Worked fine at first but now I'm having problems with one of the lights as in a black appearance on the reflective surface and moisture/condensation building inside the housing.
B00BM7G0KE|5|Correct battery for a Honda C70. Best deal I found on the internet - even included free shipping and the battery acid. I can't tell any difference between this battery and the more expensive ones.  I even ordered an additional battery.
B004VDSRFM|5|We bought these for my 2009 Nissan Altima and they fit perfectly!
B0068FVKW8|3|Keeps my coffee hot for hours but the push button top doesn't work very good
B004ZBIZF2|3|Nice set but does not fit right in our 2010 nissan sentra... Seat covers are too tight but yet too big ... Head rest covers aren't long enough & back seat is for a truck.
B007TQI96K|2|Tried this product on a pop-up camper top (2010 Flagstaff). Forest River used a thin fiberglass sheet on these that were prone to craze. While this is good paint, it could not withstand any pooled water, and after a few months failed for my application. We put on four coats, in dry weather. If you have serious problems move on to a serious solution. This is not it.
B00OJNT0ZA|5|Fir perfect good product.
B000C57M40|5|I purchased these for a 1998 F150 4X4.  I have a 31 ft camper and this helped tremendously.  Camper weighs roughly 5,000lbs and now the truck only lowers about 3 inches with these.  Tongue weight and trailer is with in the allowable range of my truck, so it is not like I was trying to put more on than it could handle.  I just wanted to improve my ride, and this did the job.  My other shocks were worn out, so there was a drastic improvement.  When installing I put the top bolt in hand tight and used a scissor jack underneath to compress the shocks to put the bottom bolt in. After that, I just tightened up all the bolts and was ready to go.  My brother-in-law liked them so much, he ordered a set for his Chevy 1500 and we put them on.  He likes them as well.
B00H3ZDF9I|5|Fits just right and will offer a lot of protection to the trunk.  Love my Husky's...
B005HAYDR4|5|Awesome, cheap, durable, great quantity, and super easy installation. 100% recommend
B000S2SKIY|5|Work great
B001GJ3DZS|5|Great cleaning product for my car.
B00VHZS6IK|2|After one two months of use one of the leds light was burned, I checked my entire electrical system and works perfect, another led still working.
B000ETWGKY|5|This is one of the best tools I ever brought and I highly recommend it it is a must-have if you working on the Ford F1 50 pickup truck  I will buy from this seller again for great tools like this absolutely love it
B007WIEU7C|5|Fits and looks great, would buy again!
B00OLHQSYU|5|Excellent highly recommend
B00K35VTBG|5|Ok,good thanks!
B001EBDXLM|5|Great quality charger especially as a maintenance charger for motorcycles. Must have !
B00RE6KV48|5|not tacky, no smell - great product
B00IT34TOI|5|I've had mine for a little over a year and had a company install a bedslide to hold a 800lb termite sprayer . The install was improperly done and the weight and frequent of use cause it to slightly give . We are talking approx. 1200lbs extended out of the bed suspended held by 2 small improperly installed screws .  I bring this up for 2 reasons<br />1. That shows how strong this product is even when used improperly. And still amazed it only weighs 200 lbs.!<br />2. I sent a picture to Decked and asked them for advice in properly mounting my equipment so this didn't happen again . They sent a rep out to my house and within 1.5 hours had a brand new unit in my truck . I'm not sure you can find another company that would go that far for a customer these days . Especially one that paid someone to install 3rd party equipment on it improperly . It's a solid piece of equipment and I  couldn't be more pleased. They really did think of everything when designing this product. It even comes with a built in bottle opener !!!
B008NO5QDQ|5|Easy to install and it seemed to be made well. No noticeable power or pep when I get on the throttle, but it was priced very well compared to other throttle body spacers.
B00523MDMI|5|Great helmet. Comfortable. Looking good. Does not fog. You can adjust the visor.  Nose guard. 5-star rating from SHARP. The buckle is fast and easy to secure.  The customer service is great. They sent me a free replacement for one of the screws that I broke.   I wish the cheek pads where a little more snug. Maybe is a little noisy.
B000BZG97M|5|Installed sensor and it works great.
B000EQJXTO|5|It seems to be a good replacement to me.The cap is made in Japan,the rotor button China.The screws that hold the cap on provided with the original cap stay in the cap when unscrewed,but with this one they don't.Thats no big deal though,you just have to keep up with them if you ever have to remove the cap for any reason.The original screw must be used with the rotor button.The cap comes with a new gasket for the distributor.You don't have to use it if your old one is good.
B00N9HJP0M|5|Perfect fit for the worn out part.
B00LH05Q88|3|I don't think this will hold up to a really tight toyota filter housing.It felt like it was going to break when I used it and I took the pressure off and threw it back into my tool box.It simply isn't of massive enough design.
B005XH6FKE|1|Terrible ride quality.  I wish I didnt throw the factory ones away.
B009G4Y9RG|5|Very quick shipping, great price, and the part was exactly what I needed!!
B009D76N0M|5|These are great quality gloves and worth every penny. I have a few riding pairs and these are my favorite.
B001JKXI9K|5|works very well and extends all the way to the corners.
B00W8LQT36|5|Shipped in a couple of days. Went on easily.
B00BE27Z6K|1|Base is too big....does not fit 9.8 Tohatsu!
B000W0OHY8|1|Too short.
B0086JIFKE|5|True
B001P29O5Y|4|This rack is made heavy duty. Very well constructed. Only issue is it WILL NOT FIT 4 BIKES. No matter what I do i can only fit 3 bikes on it.
B000CMD9NG|4|When ordering , Thought it had a soft foam grip , but was a hard plastic instead. Looks good and does the job.
B00KJ18BI8|5|Light bar arrived on time and in good condition. Installed height with the included brackets is 4.5&#34;, the answer in the question section is incorrect. The included harness is well done, and includes everything you need other than zip ties. The brightness and focus of the light is very good, haven't had it long enough to access durability.
B001EYM39W|5|Fits exactly for 2014 Dodge R/T Challenger windshield. Helps keep out the heat big time.
B000DINKPQ|1|Garbage.  It stopped working after 2 months.
B006VB8JTQ|5|Does the job well, but its a job.
B004RT1IO2|5|Awesome
B001TNX0IQ|5|I've been using this brand for years, and I still enjoy it. I bought 4 refills of this air refreshener, because I love it that much. Smells great and comes with two pieces of double sided tape for placement versatility.
B00HLVXBBQ|5|As advertised. It works.
B00BGZ1VJC|5|worked great
B000CMIV3O|5|This unit installed fairly easily in my Dodge Ram 3500. The airbags were the hard part. I installed the compressor on the top of my skid plate for my transfer case, there was lots of room.<br />It made it so easy to adjust my ride height to compensate for my wife's loading of my camper.
B000E4JLM0|5|Husband very pleased,great price and came faster than anticipated
B000IZ3MJS|1|didnt fit my car
B00NES5NEI|5|finely I could afford some new ones.. so easy to work with
B00VNBDVOC|5|I bought a set of these for my truck. One of the two bulbs was malfunctioning. I contacted OPT7 and they sent a new replacement one out immediately. They were very helpful. The product works great and is very bright. I have installed many different lighting options on vehicles over the years and these LEDs are on par with the best HID kits.
B00QLDH9YA|5|Very pleased with the product.
B000JIOLLM|5|Works great. Its very easy to use and works efficiently.
B00CQBA7XQ|5|Good pads.
B005MVB4SY|4|Personally I love IR tools and this one seems pretty good quality wise
B005UGXA38|5|Love these shoulder strap covers.  Not only does it show off my favorite team but it also keeps the seat belts clean.
B00D3STYBC|5|Nice product, nice price. Let's see how long it last in the Arizona sun
B000GU3KHO|5|XL size fits my 2012 Aprilia Tuono just right - just big enough for a little wiggle room when putting on the cover. Wads up easily to fit into a backpack or bag.
B009AA2FAY|5|very satisfied, thanks again
B009DJSLWI|5|Easily attached to my 2005 Grand Caravan, even included all the sockets filled with light bulbs, just plugged in the power cord and I was good to go!
B01093Q9BQ|5|Gelepad works great, it aleviated pressure from my joints. I travel a lot by car, makes my driving more comfortable,  great product buying more for my house and office.
B00FT9UPMU|5|Love the floor mats. Wish I had got them sooner! Easy to clean and they protect my floorboard better than the stock mats that were in there.
B00FS0WFAA|4|These arrived in the nick of time, as I needed them to install a new factory seat cover on my truck.  I have owned a few different pair of hog ring pliers over the last 30 years, and these are very basic.  If you have enough room to get a pair of needle nose pliers into the working space, then these should work for you.  However, if you are working in very tight places, you may want to spend a little more.  You cannot beat this price, there are enough hog rings to do several seats in today's cars.  If you are recovering a classic, you will need more rings.
B00V3YUJ4E|5|I am still waiting on Ford to deliver my truck after 8-weeks, but will have the dealer install the lift when it arrives. I was impressed with the finish and apparent quality of the item when it arrived. Hopefully they will lift the nose of the truck enough to level it. I was undecided between the 2&#34; or 2.5&#34; lift, but chose the 2&#34;.
B0033MEHEC|4|Great way to store the Jack but no matter what I do still get rattle noise it also rusts after a bit. Not a lot but where the Jack rubs and the top retainer is hard to get to line up properly will continue to use for a while but looking for something else attachment to the jeep is not easy but not too bad do you thinkThink it out well in advance before you drill or add screws
B005R91S00|3|Came with cheap plastic knob.  Not the metal one shown in picture.  Will have to spend money to buy the Lokar Knob and hope it fits.
B000FQ7PN4|3|okay
B004LEYJO4|5|Good stuff
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Works great on my speed triple to charge my Note 3 while riding.  I can leave the screen, GPS, WIFI, BT, and LTE all on while navigating and my battery life will still go up.  No weird cutting or splicing or anything to get this to work.  The 5 ft cable was perfect to get up to the handlebars from the battery box.  Now when my bike is in my garage I hook it up the battery tender to it at the handlebars.
B00H94LDG0|5|Great
B00GSAUHB8|1|Didn't last but 2 weeks and then ripped. Poor quality.
B00FEXAU4O|1|Product did not align with bumper on both sides and did not match up with the bumper near the wheels.
B004IARFWE|5|I just put this thing on a couple hours ago and have put on about 15 miles testing it in both city and highway traffic.<br /><br />I was VERY skeptical in buying this thing as there is ample opinion on the internet, this forum included, that CAI's are a total waste of money and provide no benefits over the stock box and filter.<br /><br />I finally pulled the trigger for a couple reasons. First, my mechanic suggested I put it on for added power, and there is an article from JP Magazine back in 2008 that compares many CAI brands and dyno tests them as well. The Airaid had the best torque increase and very near the best horsepower increase, which is why I bought it over the other brands. My memory is sketchy, but I believe it added roughly 12 horsepower and 12 lb-ft of torque at the rear wheels.<br /><br />So how does it feel? Obviously, I didn't dyno it. But I can state this as fact: it sounds great, but is not obnoxiously loud, and it revs more freely. I.e. the tachometer sweeps towards the redline more easily.<br /><br />Now, I will state this as purely opinion: it absolutely feels more powerful and faster, especially at the higher rev range. As I don't have concrete evidence, this is, as I stated, opinion.<br /><br />Is it worth the $307.50? I believe it is. It certainly won't change your life. But it will put a smile on your face, and isn't that what it is all about?
B00390PV6Q|1|Just got it. And it doesn't fit flat against the car. It has the ridges on the inside that stopping from fitting snugly!!! Would not recommend.
B006OQ35GU|4|helps with the sewer pipe that is down to low
B00HYI2D7O|4|Fits just fine and looks nice, but is a slippery surface and stuff tends to slide around on it. Would prefer something of a slightly softer material with more grip.
B00LBIXDN6|5|Unit worked fine until one of the contact pins broke off from the harness, less than a year of use. Still under the 2 year warranty. Was sent a new harness & worked perfectly! Adam at Customer service was excellent, 5 stars! Would recommend them & will do business again for future vehicles!
B0050Q5E46|5|Not only very happy with product, but also the express delivery...received package ahead of time. Will definitely be buying more of the similar product for other vehicles
B00T6JBIMU|5|Way brighter than that stock light. Having it run/brake adds a lot more visibility from behind. Highly recommend.
B0000AY1OJ|5|as advertised
B00IN5X2P4|5|Couldn't be more happier about my cargo liner.  It fits perfectly and I love the stickers to keep the mats in place.  There is a whole to pull through any parts that need to be seen and I love the split so that one seat can stay up if necessary.  If you have the highlander, this is the cargo liner you need to get.
B0024E6W02|5|Ordered on a Tuesday, received on Thursday and used on Saturday!  No issues at all.  Great service and great quality.
B00J9VORMI|5|Love them!!!!! They look perfect in my car......
B00D3YEGO6|5|Nice packaging. Cute! Not cheap looking.
B00RW2LTAY|5|Nice size, easy to apply.
B00NQSXAX2|1|Description clearly says 2 pack, I ONLY RECIEVED 1. This has been mentioned in reviews several times.
B0083CIKKE|1|Couldn't get reception if I was outside the radio station<br />Shoulda made a donation to a &#34;GOOD&#34; cause!
B000GTW2C4|3|enh
B00D43G054|1|Save your money. These worked for about two months. After the two months some of the plastic lenses fell off exposing the LED light to the elements. Also water intrusion as well. I spent several hours installing these and come to find out they aren't as they claim.
B00KY0IYZE|5|My original starter(2000 F250, 7.3 Powerstroke, 6 Speed Manual) died a couple of months back and I have been looking for a good replacement. This one seems to be a well-made and solid unit. Installation is pretty much screw off & screw on, which is quite easy in my opinion. Just be sure to disconnect battery(negative ends on both batteries), otherwise you may create some nice movie special effects right underneath your truck and ruin your batteries and maybe even more...  The engine never turned that fast before, now it is almost like starting a 4 cylinder gasoline car...
B00CCSD6CW|3|Not as easy as I thought it would be. The roll was very wrinkled when I got it. It was more then enough to do my lights but I ended up getting them done professionally.
B004Y9YIU6|3|tape fell off after three days
B00FSIN0U6|2|Worked great at first. Loved them but they are already burnt out. Very disappointed.
B005C59HG6|5|Excellent product as described.  This fits my 2004 Yamaha Vstar perfectly.
B00MV941GW|5|Nice  quality sticker!  Positive mind. Positive vibes, positive life-
B007TXYD3G|5|Good deal
B007V2DANE|5|Excellent product!
B004GEPQL4|4|Everything I was expecting
B00EZUL6ZY|5|thanks for good service and good item
B00CXBAWB6|4|We were not happy to find we needed an adaptor kit until we went online to get more info. Once the kit and adaptor were installed everything was fine
B00DBMLYSG|5|Can't do the job with out it.
B001O7PNNM|3|Granted I am not the most experienced user of a DA polisher but, the open time was a little short for my liking with the polish drying a little quicker than I'd like, also I didn't get all the scratches and swirls out on my paint partially because of the short open time. Overall it gave a really nice gloss. Be sure to use an orange or a 'light' to 'medium' 'cutting' pad on your DA or the polisher will stall out.
B00CTLGSZO|4|Installed on a 2008 Honda Pilot.  I needed extra help parking my American size SUV in Europe, so I got this because it had a camera plus sensors. It also gives me an added piece of mind in case a pedestrian walks behind my car from behind the sidewalk hedges. Installation on a Honda Pilot is difficult because the license plate is on the liftgate--the cable must be passed from the rear liftgate thru a rubber tube to the rest of the car, but with patience,a coat hanger/zip ties, duct tape, and multiple attempts, it can be done.  I passed a 12&#34; long zip tie thru the rubber tube, taped the smart hitch wire to the zip tie, and then ever so carefully pulled it thru.  It took about 20 tries.<br />I called for the extension cord and the service people were nice and helpful.  Look online for instructions from Honda for adding the factory backup camera and it will tell you how to disassemble the liftgate.  I tapped into the reverse lights using Lock-it Posi-taps.<br />Dear Smart Hitch:  My only complaint is that there are only the 2 sensors on the license plate frame.  I wish there were 2 more sensors that I could mount closer to the corners of the bumpers.  The sensors cover the back of the car ok, but if something is close to the corners of the bumpers or down low, you probably won't detect it.  I do like that the system beeps when you shift into reverse--it gives you an extra warning of what gear you're in.  If you're the electrical engineering type, I'm sure you could figure out how to solder in 2 more sensors.
B005LXO0X4|5|Very nice appearance, good price, free delivery Wil make me a return customer, thank you, Victor
B005GX3GFW|4|Easy to install. I had to put a thick rubber hose on the steering wheel so the knob wouldn't flop around. The steering is pretty thick but the rubber it comes with is too thin. This spinner went on to a trailer jockey shifter.
B000N9OBVM|1|Advertised a a soft bristle but it is nearly as stiff as my yellow bristle brush. Well made but not what I was looking for.
B008QDGLJW|5|Excellent choice
B00M9MWGOU|5|More than value for money for my 190e 16v !
B001927PS8|5|item fit perfectly and works great
B00MWEN5YA|1|Don't ever buy. Item got lost and never told me about it.
B004HE563G|5|Perfect fit on my wife's '12 Malibu
B00LQHR9GE|5|very bright
B00HE9319W|5|Works in my 2008 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor perfectly.
B001QFD83Y|5|These rear glass supports were easy to install should work for a long time.  I liked that the price was about half the price as O'rielys
B00FFAX7MI|5|Perfect fit, be prepared to use existing screws.
B00VJWYUPO|5|Kyb strut plus are the bomb. Brought the ride hight back up. Feels like a new car. Saves time on installation and not having old saggy springs makes a difference.
B00D36A17A|5|They work great but have a really bad odor that lasts in the car
B000630380|4|Great amp in power. I had a bad coil but the power was way better after I installed it.
B0024GJ568|5|great
B002VJGWVE|5|Good for the price
B004VFX3AE|5|PERFECTION. This stuff is gold. Gold honey. BUY IT NOW. Seriously...I mean it...
B007MI5SEG|4|I really like this box but it is smaller than I thought.  It looks great on my ATV.  Mounting easy enough and appears durable.
B00Y1Z6OL4|5|very bright and simple to install
B00S8P2QKQ|5|Don't pass on the right. Speeding is speeding no matter what lane you are in. Leave 5 minutes earlier.
B00RM1PMOO|4|Came with several light scratches in the clear coat. Otherwise perfect.
B000C9M4A8|5|great, got it and installed already
B007HQ0ODS|5|Mirror's easily install YouTube video for assistance.  gives extra extention for pulling wide loads.<br />Mirrows has slight vibration other than that we'll pleased cheaper than new truck.
B00SMY5O4I|3|good field of vision but it rattles annoyingly
B00GB8614E|5|Initially I had a problem with one of the two lights I had ordered. They replaced it and so far no problems.
B00O3G4WSI|5|Perfect size for the cab of the truck!
B000QUXYXE|5|excellent product fit like the original had them put on and working in like 15 mins
B002UZEC9I|5|The filters were a perfect fit!  You can't beat this deal at half the price.  When removing the old filter  and replacing the old make sure you load the filter in to the side that has the complete plastic on the housing not the little tab.  I would imagine people not see that and trying to replace the other would say it doesn't fit.  Recommending this to all my E60 buddies.
B00UW4DLJ6|5|I would not have believed that this little battery would jump start a vehicle with a totally dead battery if I hadn't done it myself.  Just to see how this would work, I pulled the battery out of my riding lawnmower and replaced it with a battery that I had replaced last summer.  It was totally dead.  Not even a &#34;click&#34; when I turned the key.  I hooked the Scorpion up and the mower started like it had a brand new battery in it!  I started the mower 7 times after that to see how long it would last, and the 7th start was just as strong as the first.  AMAZING!!  I Highly recommend this product.
B00JS18DXS|5|This is a quality product that arrived in a timely fashion.
B00DX893UE|5|Great so far
B00MD0TGKA|3|Perfect Fit on a Honda Civic 2000 Ex 4Dr . The ride is comfortable and feels more responsive than oem. Great Buy.<br />Edit: Blown front shocks in less than 6 Months
B000COCU84|5|These are clearly much brighter than the previous bulbs. I have an electrical issue on my Volvo from an accident, so I have to change these often.. I put in one, and had to do the right side when I noticed how superior they were. I'm sold and I always carry spares.<br />-David Allen
B00PQWN5DQ|1|Pressure Gauge Did not work when I received it, the needle was stuck on the stop. After tapping on my hand it freed the needle but then the gauge was 11 pounds off. Not Happy.
B003TQ5QZQ|5|Excellent product. works as described in my Shelby gt500.
B001B7C2NO|5|Work great and fit great.
B004SFKJIQ|5|PERFECT.  The height is great, love the color.  Will be very useful! Thanks!!!!
B000VHXEJ6|5|Could of been a little thicker but this is a nice product.  Stays put
B0025UGOVW|5|Excellent Product!!!! Old fashioned and built to last, great item, definitely recommend. Perfect! Exactly what we wanted!
B008H52MOC|5|Nice good helmet, not the lightest on the market, but very comfortable.
B00JIAUTR2|5|These in my '93 Silverado with new grill, awesome. Takes a little fitting. Cut 2 bolts that stick out back too far, didn't line up with factory holes & needed more play to align in grill. Use cutoff wheel on grinder, easy fix. Way more flexible frame than stock rigid ABS. Seems OK so far, not bouncy. Will put lights in old frame if problem. Side marker lights just clear over black ABS. Ugly, reused my yellow reflector oem's for now. Just sanded these with 2,000g & spraying VHT Nightshades tint on em & try again, even though poor fit. But would buy again. Worth every penny. Need to do a little fitting on everything aftermarket. Need to find the review spot where can add a picture...
B00SVYKAVQ|5|Fit great.  Ordered Saturday morning and they were at my house the following Monday.<br /><br />I wish I would have ordered the front set from the same place, those may take 7-10 days.  Still waiting so not sure.  Keep that in mind when you order yours.
B00ASMWP0I|5|So far so good. Still ticking.
B007H2RR78|5|GOOD PRODUCT . HAVE BEEN USING THIS BRAND FOR YEARS.
B0018K7CB6|1|I ordered a men's large which are so small they might fit a very small woman.
B0040QTXVW|5|Best I've ever had or used. Comes n its own carrying case (not advertised).
B000E2AQQW|5|Nice pre-filter/cover.
B00H7HS6E6|5|love it i have bought this a couple of times just wish I could also get just a purple paw prints as well
B00KARB3VI|5|This product was recommended by the company we purchased our camper from and a free sample was provided.  Toss in -- couldn't be easier!  Thetford -- the best name in products such as this.
B007J45GAY|5|This parts were perfect to my 2008 jeep commander.
B000NVW1LM|5|shipped fast.....works great.....
B00RE6KV48|5|I have leather interior on my car so when I was given the opportunity to try this product out in a promotion I jumped on it! My interior looks so much nicer since using this conditioner! The conditioner was easy to apply and did a great job at restoring the beauty to my leather!.
B007Q8HUE8|4|Expensive, but good quality.
B000FFEWQI|5|6 Months on : Its great .
B00480BWCI|1|Used them first time both as leveling blocks under the tires of my fifth wheel and under the landing gear. They deformed in both applications but more so under the wheels. Would not recommend them for larger RVs. Maybe okay for smaller, light weight rigs.
B0049EGRFA|5|Perfect
B0000AY2Z6|5|This thing is incredible. Low current draw, lots of air movement.  Good white noise for sleeping...3 speeds also... very high quality motor and fan blade..nothing like the poor quality of the $20 box fans..
B0073N3BJE|5|a tribute to America's greatest President.
B007TY46G4|5|Great product...fit perfectly....fantastic value for money!!! Highly recommended!!
B000F17ID6|4|Fit is ok and works great at hiding all the cracks on my old corolla's dashboard.
B000CQQKGU|5|Exactly as described. Does what it needs to do.<br /><br />Pair it with a Reese ball and use the interlock system. Very very nice
B005K8E9FY|5|Without a doubt the best and fastest and easiest way to replace a valve stem in a rim.  It only workd with the small stems, but is instant.
B004UR2I9K|5|Also purchased the ramp.  Use it for my snow blower.
B00B9XDOFK|4|Good price for a good brand--assuming you want a lot of it, of course.  Seems fine.  I'm greasing away.
B0039OO532|5|Apparently the best injector oil for 2 strokes.  A lot less smokey, hopefully my plugs will stop fowling out too. Previous owner may have used regular 2 smoke oil for the injector portion which is baddd
B000WPBOHQ|5|WORKED GREAT FOR MOTORCYCLE
B000BPZ36A|4|Good product when you change out engines, and throttle cables won't fit where they did on old engine.
B007RHX2FY|5|It's works it looks different from the original but functions well
B0085XFIKG|1|Not good quality!
B004ZF43Y0|5|Best set of hids. Have been good for 2 year's already
B000GOJW9A|4|Great fitting replacement, but doesn't blow as hard as the original equipment. Did fix the issue of intermittent cold air. And I did expect a loss in performance for the price hence the 4 star rating.
B005PJJ89U|3|very small nozzle to use under the car
B00KWEVZTE|5|Perfect fit, OEM filter, at fraction of dealer cost.
B003X8E5DE|5|Works as described
B00M0DEBU0|5|Great product-just as I hoped and on time!
B001KQAAFS|1|It says it fits my car but does not. Pull my door lock apart not even close. I wasted a lot of time and still have<br />A broken look. Someone needs to re-search these better, make sure they will work on cars listed.<br />Very- disappointed.......Will not buy parts on here anymore due to problems.
B00AZ4QYRE|5|Install was easy, product does what it was designed for and what I wanted it to do
B00UEY5DBS|5|Easy to install. I'm sure I get nods of approval from fellow Zelda fans at the stop light.
B00YOAY4XQ|1|Came in broke then I fixed the wire and know it leaks water and inside fog horrible product
B00753S8CC|5|Looks kick-a**. Easy to stick on. If Hyrule had a high school that should be its emblem.
B000CPI6VI|5|Works as advertised. Not much to it.
B006V4LBXO|5|High quality and seems to be fade resistant! Perfect size
B007WE7ZXM|5|fast efficient service great looking product but very firm compared with original seat
B008IYH79M|5|so far it works fine
B00NID49VM|5|Great
B0067MT9WA|5|Best spools I've used. Perfect fit every time and they're long enough so I don't have to adjust my stand between different bikes. I've had these on 5 different bikes.
B00A6VDPRS|5|Great
B00M0CBV9U|4|Very nice bag.  Waterproof.  My only complaint is it only comes with two straps (really only one) instead of four.  You have two pay extra to order the two additional straps so you can X strap it to your roof.
B000CPI65E|4|Overall a good product. Well made. Instructions were a little confusing because some assembly was already completed prior to delivery and instructions start from completely disassembled.
B002MB6RIY|5|Love this product.
B00EEYI2SU|1|Looks good but chain is weak
B001KS874M|5|Perfect
B00TF7BVWK|2|fabric was not as described ... there was no support boards in the bottom of the carrier<br />I wish it had met my needs
B007BKQSVC|5|Now I get all the girls
B0041TLKSM|5|Has worked fine.
B0006IX87S|5|Helps keep hot water heater clean
B000W0OO46|1|Bought these new and they don't unlock.  Had to cut off of my trailer.  Another one bent on first use.  Terrible customer service also. Junk, don't waste your time with these locks or this company.  Made in China.  Don't risk your family's safety.
B00KAVGUFS|5|The best walkie for motorcycling!!!!
B00CMR79H6|5|great
B003GC74S0|5|Very convenient &#34;twist it&#34; clamp. Don't have to find a screwdriver to tighten clamp. No rust stainless steel!
B002QF08ZO|5|Came exactly as advertised. Works great!!!!!
B009EU5ZM0|5|Used to repair a cracked plastic mirror stem, dried to a &#34;wet clear&#34; look, nice to work with, holding like a boss.
B000BTQLXU|5|good
B00IX0CNHM|5|It Works great! It looks resistant and makes body Lift in seconds, one can set height and stifness just adding air or releasing it. I will need two kits  more.
B00DLZVTGU|5|The new version
B000KZ1Z40|5|worked just as promised!
B000CON77M|5|great
B00DJ5KEEA|5|I have had 3 &#34;Battery Tenders&#34; over the years and they just keep getting better. Don't get me wrong; None of my previous &#34;Battery Tenders&#34; wore out. It's just that whenever I sold one of my bikes, I would give the buyer my &#34;Battery Tender&#34; as a gift and then buy another new one for my new bike.<br />Jim A.
B000C6KM8W|5|WORKS FINE
B003UIOOB0|5|Fit as a factory unit. Looks so much better than original head lights that frosted in the inside.
B00CNXMUL4|5|I bought a lot of these angels.  I gave them to my family members so that they cold put them in their cars.  They all were very appreciated that I thought of them!
B000CLYZZ8|4|spacers worked great with my after market wheels and delivery was really quick.
B00IA7U82U|4|These worked well.  Correct fit, all the necessary parts.  The 2 piece front rotors should be better in the long run.  One brake squeeks but I'll redo with the properly backing on the pads.
B00RW7X1QE|5|Fit perfectly and works just as good as if not better than the original.
B00KTIVX68|5|As advertised purchase. Worked great after a very easy task of programming the remote. All the direction are included.
B006BE0ZBS|3|Key works but there are no instruction on how to program it. Had 2 keys cut from the dealer to find out how to program it.I bought their keys for a total of $62 from them, then had these keys cut and I programmed them myself and they work. Spent $62 for nothing.
B001DMDT7U|5|Great product. Easy to install. Received it 22 hours after hitting the purchase button on my laptop. Amazing. Yes, 22 hours.
B00EF8Y43M|5|Love it!
B008Y2AU6A|5|ok
B004NABN5Y|5|Everything was great! Delivery to Germany was fast.<br />Top Service, gutes Produkt und schneller Versand.<br />Everytime again!! THX
B000CMFRE0|5|Very satisfied
B004I0FFC6|4|No complaints here. Looks good on the truck.
B00M1SNYMK|5|Perfect!
B0034ZUZM6|4|Winch works great!  It has already saved me on several occasions in the hardwood bottoms on my property.  Easy to install once you figure out how to do the wiring on your atv.  The instructions provided are lacking in that department but if you just follow the wiring diagram you should be ok.
B008G3KG70|5|Great price, good quality. Exact fit. It took me less than 30 minutes to change both headlights. Made a huge difference over the old foggy original ones. Came with all new bulbs, so it was an even better deal.
B00QYQPH1Q|5|Had to replace defective starter relay in Yamaha Grizzly. Worked like new and fit perfect
B007VR9PGK|5|These are exactly what I was looking for!
B001EOYIHM|5|I purchased this connector for my Acura RDX.  The instructions were very good and told me exactly how to install this.  I have not had a chance to try it with a trailer - but it took me less than 30 minutes to install - essentially with no tools required.  It just plugs into the connection and you are done.  A great product with good instructions.
B004991LRE|4|Been fine on the car since install with no sag but they arrived with chips/gouges in the powder coating. Not an issue now but seems like they'll rust sooner than otherwise.
B00BAZPQQ2|2|It comes in a set of two because the first will come off the moment you wash your car. Buy a magnet instead!
B000HLVNSK|5|Great kit and easy to install. I would recommend it for anyone.
B006S4WU50|5|Cute! like her a lot....
B000C560O8|5|Still has a castle nut.
B000HPS4TM|5|Took a gamble based on the part number.  These turned out to be the correct sway bar bushings for my Japanese built 1995 Toyota Camry 4cyl, LE.
B007V2E22C|5|Works terrific! So nice to have a sunshade that is big enough for my Honda Odyssey!
B000E4CON8|5|I got this a few years ago and I like it.  In today's world on the very busy freeways and streets, I wanted the widest view possible when I looked in the rear view mirror and that's why I got this.  I had help to get it clipped onto my rear view mirror (I have some trouble with my one hand), and it works great.
B00WFIJ362|4|Keep an open mind and you'll like it.  hey, for the price if you're expecting a Porsche paint job you're wrong.  I put it together in an hour, after glancing at the directions and realizing they'd not be much use.  I have a Honda Ridgeline, and a buell Ulysses which is a 400 pound bike.  Works well enough across town.
B00C86QGV6|5|Good quality product.  I would, and have, bought from them again.
B00EFFX4EK|5|Repainted my Ford 4600 using this paint along with Ford Gray and Black.  Turned out great.  I spent a ton of time prepping the unit with sanding and scraping but am very pleased with the &#34;spray painted&#34; end result and the color was great.  Just make sure to shake each can well before use and ventilate.
B0080HJL7S|5|My wife bought this bag for me recently.  She bought it cause she complains that its not nice to sit beside my garbage when she is nicely dressed to go out with me.  I currently just throw a grocery bag around my shifter console, and basically try to tuck the bag under the passenger seat and she says it’s gross.  I don’t notice it but I guess she's the one sitting beside it.  Now we put the bag in the car and no more complaints so that’s good. - item received as part of promo for review
B00M3ENQXE|5|Worked perfectly
B000WK6QME|5|Fit perfect on my 2003 Yamaha FZ1.
B003UM7B98|5|Since I have it  use one time to change brakes on my ford escape work very well and I like the way it look too, remind me I had 1 1/2 ton power zone Jack before last 20 years
B00QDELXE4|5|So far they work perfect in my 2014 Ram 2500 Limited!  I bought these because the Gen 2 LED conversion headlights I bought would not stay on in the factory fog lights.  My truck did not like the Bulbs until I installed this code canceler/anti flicker kit!  Now they light up instantly and no more flicker or lamp out light!  Thanks!
B00446YIYK|1|The first time used in the work van caused the old plugs to break and the company had to pay to have the socket fuses replaced. Also, the water doesn't get very hot!
B0001EXGZG|4|The previous  deflector I had seemed to cover more to the left  and right side of the hood.  Notwithstanding, seems to fit well and looks good.
B000PSMVTA|1|Unless your rip is very tiny, this is useless.
B00THAETMO|5|looks great on my car, not to big or to small, easy to put on.
B008MC9SXS|5|This is good product
B005EMPNQU|5|Installed quickly and easily and seem to be doing a good job.
B00BVPOC20|5|Delivery arrived when it said it would.<br />Watched youtube video and installed very easily.
B00IPS4APU|1|Dont waste you money, get the chip or crack fixed by a pro.  Or wait till the windshield gets pretty bad and just replace it. This product is a ripoff!
B004R3734W|4|Fits like it should, looks good and meets my needs.<br />Like others mentioned, it makes some wind noise, not enough to annoy me so I keep them on.<br />Works fine mounting two pairs of Malone j-racks so I can haul two Wilderness Tarpon 100 kayak's.
B00CTFMZJS|5|It was the right part and it install very easy
B008I2P0KC|2|Wasn't what I had hoped! Didn't work like review said it would at all.
B00CE0MDKY|4|These lights weren't as bright as I expected.  I am using them as additional brake lights, and because there is also a very bright led brake light already working, these will add to the lighting, but they wouldn't serve as brake lights on their own.
B0065750FC|5|Worked like a charm. Parts were exactly as described and dropped right in. This clutch feels very solid and feels like it will last.
B000BQ083C|5|ORDERED ANOTHER ANOTHER
B0058WXNOK|3|not exactly what I wanted but worked ok
B00JIJ4LWW|5|I am ashamed to say that we have never properly conditioned our leather sofa since it's purchase 5 years ago.  We had to have some minor repairs done to our sofa at the upholsterer and it was he who told us to protect our investment by treating the leather, at least, every three months.  We did some research and decided on Leather Nova Conditioner and Cleaner due to its rave reviews.  The actual process was painless.  It was so convenient too, since it came with it's own applicator sponge.  Since using Leather Nova, I can't tell you how many time guests have inquired if we bought a new sofa.  I gladly share our secret with them.  It was so easy to apply and the smell (which was not overwhelming at all) was gone within a day.  We will recommend Leather Nova to all our friends and family most certainly.
B000GZJ140|5|This is why I buy Yoshimura every time. There always the best performing pipe and sound amazing!!! I bought a 2005 gsxr 1000. Had a hotbodies pipe on it. The same week I knew that pipe had to go. This Yoshimura TRC pipe has this bike running like you would expect a gsxr 1000 to run. I couldn't be happier with this buy.
B00KBJ8X0E|2|This was much smaller than we expected.
B00736OY9W|5|Very bright headlights, I can see the road plenty well at night and get that nice blue HID look.
B001JSYC1A|5|Installed in the police car.. it's great. I do not understand why anyone would slide it in between the window and door. I used screws and installed it on the console of the car.
B00BDEP5ZM|5|I buy a product similar to this at a campground store and pay a good penny for it. This product is better and also a better price!
B004GCD37U|1|Did not fit correctly.
B00684TAYY|5|just what i need
B00KMYYQ36|5|This stuff works great, I cleaned my boat cover with a bleach/dish soap mix as recommended by sunbrella. After it dried I sprayed it down with 303 and the water just beads up and rolls off.
B006H34AE6|5|Works well and came quickly.
B003RVUZIG|5|Easy to program and so far works great!!
B00BKW4440|4|Pretty good winch. The screw that holds the end of the cable on broke so I ordered a winch rope.
B00554PP74|5|it is a cable it works
B000N3MVA6|5|Good replacements
B002R0B9R4|5|The same exact ones are sold by O' Reilly's. Work perfect
B00MQAG1X2|5|Good deal!
B00J49TOZ0|5|Much better than expected
B000C5O1VW|5|Good quality NGK spark plug for decent price.  I used it on my John Deere LX176 mower.  JD oem parts are over priced.
B000EFJRU0|5|These fix good on my impreza. Install was a breeze (with the right tools). The drop seems little more than 1.5&#34;.
B00PQH7YUG|4|SO far so good.  Thought it was going to be a bit brighter, but happy with it.
B00J15JPDI|3|This is alright but it's stickers and I'm sure weather will mess em up
B00JR33NI2|4|Was very easy to install.  For more stability, I used longer and larger screws. Looks and functions great when installed properly
