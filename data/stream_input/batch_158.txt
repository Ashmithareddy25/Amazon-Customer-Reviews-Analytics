B000WJFSLU|4|I am always needing bulbs and these work for me
B00167TYHQ|4|Very nice. Some units have storage for power plugs so they don't get list. This one does not have storage.
B001N729FS|5|I bought this for my boat.  I'm notoriously forgetful in not turning off the switch that controls the main power that controls a couple things (fish finder and fuel gauge on the dash).  But after my boat sits for a few weeks between uses, it will run down the battery.  Now when I flush my motor and disconnect the fuel line and take out the boat plug, I turn the knob and it cuts the power to my starter battery.  No more dead battery at the boat ramp.
B00KONM7OK|4|it was perfect and I really liked how it looked and fitted
B0062WC9IQ|1|Broke after 2 weeks and about 50 starts..
B004JOTJD2|5|Needed and works!
B0089XO9RU|5|Great product & the best seller I've ever dealt with. The communication between me & the seller was just perfect. They are very friendly & the product was reasonable priced. I couldn't ask for more.<br /><br />The product itself is made very well & will work perfect for installing a battery in my trunk. This way it'll keep it from rolling around.
B00H1ES6S6|5|All ten of mine worked, i absolutely love them. Boy what a difference these make compared to the incandescent bulbs.  For $10 bucks its a must for any car.  They are super bright white.
B001E0HUYY|1|Did every prep work and more ! Does not contain rust for more than 3 days ! Don't waste your money ! This not a miracle product, and Eastwood should be ashamed for selling it !!!
B0017TB9SU|5|If you've ever dug a wood post out by hand it can be a tough job. This tool makes it sooooo easy. I recommend you go ahead and purchase the chain as well, you will need it. No directions, but so simple you don't need any.
B004AMPLGM|2|Marks and deep cuts were found in one of the front corners pieces, but the others were showing mishandling marks as well.  No assembling instructions were found inside the package and there are no practical design for installing this rack over two parallel bars. I created my own attachment system using four cable tensioners and four adapting pieces I made from aluminum plate plus four holes drilled for anchoring points. I tried U bolts but they were a non fit for the size of the Bars.
B008RDL78G|5|Super handy to have an pretty easy to put on if you follow the great directions posted by others in the reviews. Thanks for that!!  We put them on my husband's Grand Cherokee (2011) and they are very solid. We took a yakima roof-top carrier 5 hours to the beach and left on for weeks and it didn't budge. The bars are a lightweight metal and the clamps are plastic, but seem very solid and heavy-duty.  Highly recommend and much less expensive than OEM or other top brands.
B004W5TJME|5|Great lights...would buy again
B000H5OPAE|1|Ordered a bulk package for approximately. $10.00. The product I received was different than the picture. The pictured springs are shorter than those I received. Subsequently, they won’t work!<br /><br />This company then charges you a $5.00 restocking fee. So by the time you pay the postage and handling to mail them back, you might as well throw them away and save the hassle!
B000THEZR8|5|I purchased a webber 120 Q grill which has a fitting for the small propane cylinders. Wanted to connect to a large gas cylinder, so purchased this connector hose. It is only $6 more then the rubber one, and has nice brass fittings to connect to grill and tank. I think it will last much longer then rubber one. As some have noted rats, squiralls and other varmits cannot crew it. Hose is 4 feet long, plenty of length to store tank under table.
B000ALBS0K|5|excellent replacement part, perfect fit , now I can throw away the board I was using to prop up the gate...
B00IEOT8NO|5|Excellent for a fan of the movies!  It came with a Marty McFly drivers license!  How cool!
B00B51SG2M|5|Accurate description and prompt delivery
B00JGSZ49Y|5|Works great in 2015 VW Beetle Convertible.
B005N6XYGS|5|I really like this shirt but it is a bit more faded looking then the picture shows it to be
B000GU5LSK|4|Perfect! Looks great on my bike
B000IYBF6Q|5|Looks identical to the original part on my Toyota Sienna 2004. Cleared up my catalytic converter below [efficiency] threshold service engine light. Michael
B009IK9KV8|2|While the design of the adjustable mirror is nice, like other reviews on here, I now see what they mean about the mounting system not being good.  This mirror cannot mount on my 07 Prius. I bought two of these mirrors and now have to eat the cost to return them. ($5)  Save your money and buy the adhesive bubble mirrors - put them on the outside bottom corners of your vehicles' current mirrors.  They'll cost less and do the job well, as I had discovered on my previous vehicles.<br /><br />If the manufacture were to improve on the mount, I'd consider buying the improved version if my next vehicle needed them.
B000EQR6FM|5|exact fit and can't tell difference in oem
B00L3FSDSW|5|This pump and company is awesome.  One of the plastic feet was broken in shipping and I wasn't even going to worry about it.  The company pro-actively reached out to see how it was working and without hesitation shipped a new one out!  Will definitely be recommending these!  I use it to pump up my tires and my air-bag helper suspension.  Works great, seems like it will last a long time.
B00KTIUID2|5|Work great.I love the fact I could get a different color so I can tell the difference between the remote for the wifes car and mine.
B0009TO35U|5|Came nice and fast, and fits like a glove. Yesterday I recommended replacing his damaged Peterson lenses, and that getting mine was a breeze.<br />Good times.<br />Carl Schmeklinberg
B00062ZZQQ|4|This filter was very easy to install, only took me a few minutes. I put it in my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee, it sounds really nice and clean, it eliminates the choppy noise from gear to gear and sounds smooth. But I have not noticed very much performance difference yet. My MPG has stayed the same while I think the horse power may have increased by 1-5 MAX. Overall it is a nice replacement from the cheap stock air filters you can buy anywhere.
B0009PSJ22|5|This is my second one after a year use.  Keeps my car like a new car smell although I am a smoker.
B003NZDM5Y|5|Very nice product.  Fits my 8 yr old well (Adult size SMALL) and the gloves and goggles make it very good package.  Uses for his mini/trail bike on our property and (dead end) road.
B0041FXNNG|5|These are well made, look great!<br />Highly recommend!
B00CKYRH6E|5|GREAT PRICE!!!!!!!!!!
B000BGK22E|5|Excellent product. Of course it replaced a 20-year old exact product, but it works flawlessly again.
B004RBER7A|1|Cant get the sticker off the paper to install.  I am not sending it back because I dont feel like it.  It is one sticker and I had this problem before.  There is another vendor I have bought many stickers from and they work fine every time.  Keep looking.
B002UC4TVC|3|Works great as it is intended but definitely not essential or required to complete the Happijac frame tie down kit.
B00QXE3Y0A|5|this part fit very good very happy with it will by agen
B00CQLOD4K|2|[[VIDEOID:5b055676195608e63867fb145afe4bc9]]Nice size for outside mirror. The tape is lifting off from rear of light, before mounting on mirror. Will replace with real 3m tape. Leds are bright in dark, but not very in the day. The case is softish plastic, so its bends to curves. Will update after install.    Update: Installed. Worked for 1 day, then both blinker and hazard fuses blew. Replaced fuses. Pulled down light, and inserted 360 ohm resister in power line. Working again.    If the fuses blow again, I'll dump.    The install on the mirror is not the best looking either.
B000NW4RZ4|5|The part fit and worked as expected. Great purchase.
B000MXW2EM|5|Great time saver.
B004BCHOVG|5|great fit. nice price,
B001GJ3E2K|4|The packaging says mothers fender well brush. It has a nice long handle, rubber bumper where the bristles meet the handle. Last line on package said it its also prefect for fender wells. I thought this brush would be safe to use on the clearcoat on my wheels. But even though they are soft they look like nylon. I will probable just use them on the fender wells and maybe the rubber on the tires. I will update review after I use them.
B004C63GC2|5|Works fine. I replaced and saw a difference in the  brake response. Working fine for now. Lets see how long it will take
B000C9Q2LA|5|Worked very well for my 2001 GMC Yukon with the 5.3L.
B00E4YPFUI|5|This went well on my truck!!!!!<br />Get a lot of thumbs up on this one!!<br />So True on this one!!!!
B000C9UJ4G|5|I bought this cabin air filter for a 2005 Ford Escape XLT and it was a pretty snug fit but nothing that would make me believe it was the wrong size. I have only been using Wix filters for a while but I am pleased with the construction, quality and performance.
B002M6EE1G|5|Seemed to be of good quality as Moog typically is, but make sure to check the control arms before you order!  Someone had previously installed replacement control arms with non removable ball joints in my 2005 Chevy Aveo.  I ended up returning these ball joints and ordering the whole Dorman 520-161 and 520-161 control arms.  (Which ironically had the same non removable ball joints)
B000OUXUI0|5|I use this tool for changing my car's power steering rack, it gets the job done safely to me. I use it for changing motor mounts also.
B004HLWPO2|5|Perfect fit.thank you.
B008Y9K0OU|5|perfect fit on 2000 F150
B007KFNCGM|5|I've had him on the car for a few weeks they weren't great I recommend these rotors than other brands
B000GBMU6A|4|I ordered this item and when it arrived, there was no hardware in the package. I had to go to the local hardware store and buy some stainless steel screws and washers in order to install this. It also didn't fit at first so I had to modify the top to get it to slip inside the grille area. Other than that, it looks really nice and adds the look I was aiming for.
B000BZJPN2|5|Why pay BMW a premium price for the same qual;ity filter.
B004B61B34|5|This is about the 5th or 6th time I rated this as now I know how they get so many ratings. This item fits a 2009 Jk jeep perfect and the light harness works awesome to. They will run you close to a hundred bucks local so this is a great deal. No problems. Thanks Amazon. Shipping and receiving were very good with no problems.
B006K8GKBO|4|Plastic is adequate for occasional use, but I would rather have the combs made of metal for durability.  Are there metal combs like this for professionals?
B00OMJNLJ2|5|Always liked these gas cans. The new ones they have out these days and want you to use are horrible you waste more gas and spill more then you get in tank. That's not safer.
B001G625A0|5|As advertised.
B00DTEESJS|5|Perfect, fit and finish
B00KWQRC4O|5|This is an awesome organizer!!!
B000MS44D4|5|This is a very nice funnel. I like the long thin neck so it is great for a lantern. Good quality.
B000EVU89I|5|The Equus 3612 compression tester comes with enough adapters to fit common engine sizes.  I have a pair of identical snow blowers---Toro Powerlites with 2 stroke engines. One is hard to start despite a recent carb cleaning and new plug.  I just unwrapped this tester as a gift and already used it to spot low compression in the hard-to-start blower.  The good snow blower had normal compression.  I would recommend the Equus 3612 based on port-size versatility, quality of build, and price. Nice tester!
B000CIT2U4|1|Did not fit my application. Product was well made. I decided to go with a Gibson complete Cat Back system.
B009X1SRXY|3|It is a Quality seat but made for shorter people like maybe 5'8&#34;-5'10&#34;. I am 6'3&#34; and headrest at middle of neck. Also if mounted in Jeep YJ with 5spd the bolsters make it difficult to use clutch.
B00V5Q74YI|1|this item failed to function properly according to my technician who let me ride with him and watch his computer readings.<br />To return the item would have been more trouble than the item was worth.
B004P5W66M|5|Fit correctly and the price was reasonable, it is nice to not have to run to the dealer to get this piece for my repair
B00252CYP0|4|This is the brand the auto shop used before I started doing my own oil changes. It comes at a decent price, too.
B00155237W|5|Give the car a sharp and clean look.
B0097W9FN0|3|good product but was not the right switch for make and model
B006S3XAQY|5|I use these locks on the doors of my truck, very good product for a good pressures. Highly recommended, The order arrived very quickly and well. thanks
B00IXXRLJ4|1|It was the wrong part for the year of the truck even though they gave you guide to check the year
B0023VH5MK|2|Missing $15 plug for bulb that description says it has.
B007V2DQ3S|5|Although it is a bit more expensive than anything you could buy from over the shelves, it fits perfectly and it is of a very good quality.
B0084OJQMC|5|This product is for the Hyundai Genesis Coupe two doors; do not get it confused with the Genesis Sedan.  The product fit just perfect. I recommend it to everyone.
B00G8PSMA6|5|This product professionally made and it looks really good on Ferrari. They have done such a good job making this product.
B004L0P1M2|3|The mat came folded crumpled up and stuffed in a potato chip box. It is creased and in many places and doesnt lay flat. Mat looks terrible as it is lumpy and sticking up in places since it wont flatten out. The mat may be a nice item but i gave it  3 stars due to the poor way it was packaged and shipped out.
B007VRETW0|1|I bought three of these and all three leaked at the inlet fitting installed by jegs. All jegs offered to do was replace them or refund if i sent them back. What use would it be to replace them with more garbage!<br /><br />I ended up pulling their inlet fitting out adding sealant and re installing,no leaks after this.  So if you are buying these top avoid assembling the wilwood ones don't waste your time here.
B001GMTAC0|5|Arrived quickly and in great shape. All hardware was correct and included. Install was a breeze other than the flat pieces that need to fit through the holes. DO NOT let this sway you from buying this Curt hitch!! All hitch manufacturers have this issue! All you need to do is grind the flat pieces long side down some and round the edges slightly then the piece will fit just fine. I've installed 3 hitches now on CR-v's from 3 different hitch manufacturers and have had to do this so it was no big surprise that I would need to repeat as I had before.<br />It was also nice to have the added mount, pin and clip included as I have a need for two different size balls. This makes it easy to change them out as needed without having to go out and purchase another. Great hitch for the price!
B000GTY2Y0|1|New manifold to carb gasket not tight enough - allowed air leak.  Also, the float bowel needle tip appears to have a different angle and would not seat properly allowing gas to leak out the overflow with float height properly adjusted.  Save yourself hours of troubleshooting and frustration - buy these parts at the stealership....
B003ZUNAVS|1|Where there should be an exclusion for this part not fitting a ford raptor at all. Had to call mfg, to confirm.
B0051MYLS4|3|As a design, the brush is excellent and reaches all the areas of my wheels. The pad and micro fiber material are soft and clean really well without much effort.<br /><br />However, the plastic handle broke about half way through my first use so I would recommend being gentle with your scrubbing our investing in metal handled models.
B005LETS62|4|I ordered this item a couple of months ago and I am fairly satisfied with this item. The material is made out of metal and there is a durable sticker to stick to your car. Before implying this item, I recommend to clean and wash the area that is being applied to. Within the couple of months it still sticks to my car. If you want to add a little pizazz to your Nissan, this item would be the one for you.
B001KS6FPK|5|Noticeably superior to cheap replacements.
B001KS6FPA|5|Great product and price. Thanks A+++
B0061MZCQI|4|Installed on a custom build; exactly what I was looking for.  Looks and works as described; would purchase again.  Easy to install.
B0006MTRJ2|5|Received yesterday, already have it hooked up and using it., so far so good.
B00CJNEE4O|5|Fast shipping and the shirt was perfect. It was made very well and true to picture! My boyfriend loved it for a present.
B000GFCO3U|5|Everything went great, hubby loved it!<br />Service way beyond excellent!
B008DWWZU0|5|Just what I wanted
B005M3JVUU|5|as advertised
B003E3OG96|1|Will not stay on my 2007 Tundra wheels even if put on with rubber mallet.
B00KWMO7V4|5|Great fit. Able to trim to nearly any shape and water proof.
B000B8JUNY|5|Love it
B0028JQYPG|4|When used to jack up my 2000 Honda Accord Coupe V6 on the pinch welds, these jack stand's arm bends at an angle.  Not the best in safety, but it got the job done and was great for the price.  Was sturdy when I tried to push the car to check for wobbliness.  Also paint is easily scratched and chipped but is expected at this price!
B0016KABGQ|5|ok
B00G6H2WVQ|5|Really easy to install.  Watched a youtube video to do it.  All the lights like great and better than oem - make sure to check polarity before assuming that you got a bad bulb if it does not work the first time you put it in.
B003LHSIR6|3|The title says it all. I bought these for my wife's Nissan Juke. They look good and stayed on, but just had a cheap feel to them...
B000O1E4W0|1|Very disappointing. The build quality is not bad at all, pretty rugged construction. The unit is fairly large, unnecessarily, does not seem to have a lot of circuitry inside that justifies the large size. The LED is RED ! The product display picture shows an LCD display. This is NOT the case, its RED LEDs, just awful ! thats so old school.<br /><br />It appears that the unit is not calibrated properly. It will display that a battery is bad<br />LONG before it actually is. Example, if you buy a brand new battery and use these digital<br />testers it will show that the battery has failed after more than 7 months, which is stupid.<br /><br />If a tester indicates a bad battery, I should have less than 3 months REAL life left.<br />As one reviewer correctly posted, that he uses a load tester and it has never failed him.<br />I have to agree with him on that. I recently tested a bad battery using a voltmeter<br />and it showed 12.68v. The fact is, the battery was so weak it could NOT even energize the<br />solenoid at ALL. A load tester would have revealed that the battery could not handle the<br />load in its current state (even at 12.68volts). I just replaced the battery with a new one<br />and it started right up @ a measly 12.3 volts (BRAND NEW BATTERY from auto store). If<br />I had used the OTC tester it would have been pointless, since it would have been reporting<br />bad battery 10 months ago even though it was being used daily without any issues. So thats<br />where the calibration being off comes into play. OTC needs to adjust it so that &#34;failed&#34; does<br />not show up so quickly after use. If they did that it would be a strong contender<br /><br />I recommend DO NOT buy. OTC is generally known for good automotive products but this one sucks !<br />Purchase a basic carbon pile tester instead ! Its much more accurate, rugged, reliable and cheaper.<br />If you are rich you can buy the Argus Digital Battery Analyzer or a digital battery analyzer from<br />midtronics. Those are top-notch stuff.
B005C5C92K|4|Worked on KTM 525 exc
B000FGCY7Q|5|Fit perfectly. Recommended
B0055QOKC8|4|Being in the middle of a Texas summer I haven't had much opportunity to use this on extended trips.  It does seem to function well the short rides I have used it on.
B005N6XH6U|2|This shirt runs far too small. I ordered two sizes bigger than what I normally wear, its tight in the entire body, as well as sleeves.
B0058J505S|2|These came so quickly and looked great! BUT if your going to attempt to do an at home install, it's not going to be that easy. First, we had to take the bumper cover off the car, and had trouble getting the stock sockets to lock into place in these lights... Then we realized that the reverse light and blinker need to be rewired because they were backwards and can't fit the sockets into where they should go. Then after all that headache and just giving up, we realized that part of the LED's on one of the lights weren't on. The next morning it was a different portion of them that isn't working. Needless to say, 5 hours later, I'm running reverse lights as blinkers and blinkers as reverse lights and will have to go pay a professional after all. ALSO, like many of the reviews, these are NOT flush with the vehicle. There is a noticeable gap on all sides of the light. I'm just hoping its our mess up and not a faulty LED panel. After all the frustration, I don't know that they are worth it. But they do look pretty good so far.
B000AP6RHK|5|Quick delivery as advertised!! Good quality
B005P9WXMY|5|High Quality and beautiful accessory manufactured by Mercedes Benz.<br /><br />Also comes complete with adhesive backed rubber spacers and chrome screw caps that even fit the head of the hex bolts I used to mount the plates with.<br /><br />Note: You must supply the mounting screws (or bolts).
B009NRM11C|5|Worked great for extending our existing setup to where the operator actually sits.
B00432S99U|4|So far so good. We'll see what happens after the rains. Lights up our flag very good. Still was on at 4am on a one time check.
B009D3EWGI|5|Very comfortable.  Love the tinted shade on my helmet.  Everything is<br />very affordable. Safety is not too expensive. Love it
B002FYBS1O|5|I have an 04 Camry but these headlight fit any year from 02-06.  Granted there is a little bit of rewiring to do, but I always liked the layout of this headlight rather than the 02-04 version.  Very easy to install(my expertise level is advanced), and comes with bulbs pre-installed.  If you have a 02-04 Camry and need new headlights, try the 05-06 versions and you wont be disappointed.
B00842A7F4|3|It's actually slightly larger than OEM for Honda.
B00KTIQU3E|4|worked perfectly
B002OP64AY|5|Nice for the price
B002QG43UO|5|thunderbird key ring. very well made key chain,gave it out as a christmas gift,he really liked it.,has a key ring for his 1966 thunderbird
B001S8GXBS|5|Made my 302 in my bronco sound mean, and flows great. Get a new y-pipe and high flow cat first though if you want to really enjoy it.
B000E75S60|5|Fit perfectly.
B007IWEFOK|5|Very happy will do bussiness with you again. Product meet it's purpose and is great. Like I said I am very happy.
B001B5IXC0|5|These towels were reasonably priced and work very well for putting a nice polish on steel. They didn't leave much lint at all, either.
B004W5TJME|5|Better than I expected them to be
B007SKAKPU|5|Does what it does. Helped me diagnose whats wrong with my car when the light is on. This way I know if a mechanic attempts to get fishy, I know.
B004MG3S4I|3|no matter what i do to install this light the passenger side of it will not sit flush. It isn't up high enough for the weather stripping not to hold and it really isnt noticeable to anyone but me. however, it gets my ocd kicking in when i know it isn't flush
B004D5Q296|5|item exactly described
B000CQI06S|5|I used these hubs on a 1999 Chevy Tracker (Suzuki Vitara is the same) They seem like excellent quality and will work very well for my Tracker, even though the Tracker originally had automatic locking hubs. I'm welding up the front differential, so will only have four wheel drive when I need it. In the summer the front differential won't even be turning, so maybe the fuel economy will improve too. I highly recommend this product.- Bob S.
B003BGPBG8|3|2004 chevrolet duramax lb7 I didn't notice much if any difference but my truck is all stock
B002EOVDII|5|I HAVE HAD CHARGING CORDS FAIL, BUT THIS ONE SEEMS SUBSTANTIAL AND WORKS FINE. IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT. (ABOUT THREE WEEKS)
B001MA1P6K|1|Bulbs were not bright at all and didn't fit my bike without a tiny modification. I do not recommend these for anyone
B002LBND2S|5|Works great. Vanilla scent is really subtle and pleasant. A lot of similar sprays are to strong or the smell is awful this stuff is just right and lasts a long time.
B0002SRH7O|5|Very nice and good quality items. Thank you.
B006UKG972|5|they fit perfectly and my puma 90 feels more attach to the ground...
B0002SRDVE|5|Very happy with product.  Would reccommend to others. feel requiring 12 or mor words unnecessisary.  just saying happy with product should be sufficient.
B000ALBS0K|5|bueno
B001BB4LBG|5|Needed a cover for my trailer spare and this product fit perfectly. Works great on a 15&#34; rim trailer spare.
B000JZYW0A|3|DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT PUTTING THESE ON A NON TRACK CAR. Like the description says they are great for driving to the track and on the track, but the track better be close to your house because these pads are unbearably loud when operating under normal driving circumstances. Performance rates a 5, but noise rates a 1.
B0049MVDUQ|5|Pretty easy to install. 1.5 hours. No special tools. 2011Camry LE did not need to lower exhaust. Was able to install laying on ground, without lifting car. Used car jack to hold one side while i put bolts in, making life better. Put a 17mm wrench on the nuts at the back of the car, though, as they are only spot-welded to the panel
B002TJJWEK|5|Second sticker I bought like this, would buy it again.  Great quality, looks great on the rear car window.  Easy to apply.
B005KDO8U0|4|I've used these lights on my previous vehicle (2006 Dodge Ram 1500) and was VERY impressed with the visibility improvement over stock.  As I've just traded that for a 2011 F150 Platinum (new), I'm back to a truck with the same headlights as I had in 1993.  Very yellow, dim, definitely not as sharp as the truck they're attached to.  I do acknowledge that these will have a much shorter lifespan than stock halogens, and I've accepted that.  Some other reviews for comparable models site less than 12 months, but the lamps I purchased for my Dodge lasted at least two years, and I drove with my headlights on (daytime) constantly.  I've purchased two sets, installed one set, and keep the other set in the glove box for quick access on the road.  If the first set fails before 12 months, my receipt will be in Amazon's records, and Sylvania will send me a new set for free. (Warrantied for 1 yr)  This should get me roughly 2-3 years of use for $120, after that, I'm sure 'headlight technology' will advance so the lifespan on these or other bulbs will be greatly lengthened, or XID's will come down in price and improved ease of install, and I'll go with those.
B004HLWPO2|5|Perfect fit !  Easy to install and I can not tell from original.  Half the price form Toyota=  Take the bulbs out from the original for spares
B00EBQFC5C|5|Nice and clean
B002MQAWOY|3|thankls
B00L4NHW7Q|4|Finally... mats that don't smell.  I like that they're wider than most mats I've had.  They have a silvery/grayish color to them, but don't look bad with the black interior of my car.
B001DKSQQQ|3|using it in my Camaro, don't know if it reduces temps much..
B008J25JJI|5|We bought a used vehicle a few years back and they only had 1 FOB.  We were told that they could get another one for $100 plus dollars.  We said no and dealt with it for approx. 3 years.  Just bought 3 FOB's (1 Yellow, 1 Blue, & 1 Pink) and I love the look of them.  They are exactly as the ones that came with the vehicle.  So I received them all at 3 different times so I waited to get them all to program them.<br /><br />Once I had all of them I got in the car with the 3 new and the 1 I already had.  PLEASE NOTE - When you are programming the new one you need to have the old one present so you can reprogram it with the new.  If you don't the old one will not work anymore.  So I started with one of the new FOB's and did the old one as the last one.  Now all FOB's work on the same vehicle.  I saved hundreds of dollars and I just love that it was DIY!<br /><br />I am loving these FOB's and the different colors!<br /><br />When you are attempting to program and you do not hear the 3 chimes as described in the instructions, fear not, just move forward with the instructions.  I did and it actually was programing the FOB's I just didn't get any of the chimes.  So if you don't hear the 3 chimes still push on the lock and unlock buttons on the FOB...you will probably not hear the 2 chimes telling you it is programmed.  Just hold them down...count to 10-15 and move on to the next.  It does work.
B004IXQIIS|1|The fuel pump was no good sent it back
B007KLXR4I|5|These are great to have multiple hitch locks keyed alike.  However, measure your hitch!  I bought three to secure my rear trailer hitch, front hitch and accessory.  Unfortunately my rear hitch was too wide to accept it.  Fortunately the &#34;heavy duty&#34; model (red end) pin is interchangeable with this one and I was able to use the matching lock with the longer pin.
B004FDY27K|3|So the good news is the charge lasts forever.  I can go on a 2 hour ride and come back turn it off and jump on the bike a week later and still has enough juice for another 2 hour ride.<br /><br />The Bluetooth works great.<br /><br />The bad parts:<br />The volume buttons are hard to find with riding gloves on.  I wear some pretty thin ones.<br /><br />The audio port is the same port they use for charging and the cable sticks straight down with a very stiff plug that is about 3/4 inch long.  So when you sit the help on the ground the plug hits the ground and puts a lot of weight on the plug.  This has caused the plug to start to come loose and when riding I sometimes loose the left sounds and have to wiggle the plug to get it to come back.<br /><br />The FM radio sucks.  I only use it for Pandora from my phone.  We have a station very close with a great signal and I can barely pick that up and has a lot of static.<br /><br />I haven't tried to use it to make a call but the sound is pretty loud in my helmet and can't imagine anyone could hear anything while moving at faster speeds.
B008UZAUSY|4|Great for the price. Fits perfect In my truck. Delivered to my door on time.. Not as smooth as I imagined but I'm happy with my purchase
B00LMI4HWQ|5|Works Great. Programmed in less then 5 mins.
B00BD5H05O|4|Decent for the price..but not the best fit but it will do. It's not bad by Amy means
B007V8WBPQ|1|Along with the others thought I was  getting  six of these not just one cheap little  light.
B002LNI8GW|5|I was referred to Griot's Garage products years ago but decided to buy cheaper products - convinced they were the same.  I was wrong. When I finally purchased my dream car there was nothing too good nor too expensive for it. I finally purchased Griot's Garage Speed Shine towels (the Speed Shine is also great) and was blown away by the quality, softness and durability of these towels.  There is no comparison to those you can buy at your local store.  If you enjoy and value your vehicle, spend a little more and try out Griot's Garage Micro Fiber Speed Shine Cloth.  I have purchased these again and again - having never used one up but opting to move those with good wear to my \\"other\\" vehicle.
B00EQ3NID8|5|Replaced both sets of headlights and driving lights at the same time. These are very bright and help at night.
B00NF1TL1A|5|Easy installation and perfect fit.<br />GM should have had these as standard equipment in their trucks.  Since they didn't, this is the next best thing.<br />Do yourself a favor and get one.  Your AC coil will stay cleaner and you won't have dust blowing all over the cab of your truck.
B000OCIVZA|2|The description said these fit my application, but when I went to use them, they don't fit. My cam didn't have the &#34; flat spot &#34; I'm sure they would work well for the correct application..... whichever one that truly is.
B008MQTBD6|5|Terrific price with timely delivery! I recommend this plate for others with similar interests. It is strong and easy to clean as well.
B0006H8CIE|5|I can see everything now , I thought the mirrors would be about stock size , they are much bigger , pulling my trailer is so nice now that I can see behind me
B007LICJ0S|4|we had to cut two of the teeth off though - they were hiding the MVA stickers
B008G1WI4G|4|Installed and working well.
B000EQMJO0|5|Perfect fit for the ZETEC engine. Recommend anyone replacing this item, replace the transmission mount and the torque rod. This will ensure that the motor mount will last.
B003VGHC6A|5|It was awesome
B002FY28EA|5|This headlight is nicely made and is a lot cheaper then buying one from the dealer. I installed this myself and saved even more money. Someone drove into my car and thus the reason I had to buy a new one. This is one of the smartest buys I have had. I would recommend this product to anyone that has to replace a headlight.
B00DOHTSSG|5|Very happy with them. Perfect fit
B000C6KK8O|1|Cannot vouch for the quality of the filter but this item does not fit 2001 Toyota Sienna.  It is smaller than what is required.
B002UC1AYQ|5|Fits perfectly the new replacement design has a larger opening so no calcium build up. Easy to install. Great price includes the flange.
B000CGHZDW|1|This was a replacement for a prior brand new fuel pump that was received bad out of the box. The fuel pressure was verified by two different gauges before and after replacing the fuel pressure regulator. According to Delphi the pressures are supposed to be KOEO 48-55 psi. This pump only delivered 40 psi KOEO and dropped to 32 psi at idle. The rev test only indicated 35-38 psi.<br />Also, there were no fuel line retainers delivered with the pump.
B003NBFKDK|2|Bought this for our annual summer trip. (10 hour road trip).  Went together easy, no problem placing on vehicle, loading capacity was great.  About 8 hours into our trip we noticed a funny smell . . . we stopped for lunch and noticed two holes melted through the plastic cargo containers and a heat spot on a metal trunk.  At this point, we didn't have a way to fix so we waited a little bit for things to cool down, crossed our fingers and drove on to our destination.  When we arrived at camp and assessed the damage, it was a major crimp in our plans.  The one plastic container held footwear for our time at the lake (a rocky beach and bottom necessitates footwear at all times), not only was the container totaled but 90% of the footwear had melted, shrunk and twisted - and these were not cheap flip flops but Teva Sandles and Kamik water shoes.  The other container was not damaged (metal) but the food inside that was closest to the wall melted and all the liquid items in the box had blown their tops . . . thus doing in a good portion of the food we had brought with us.  So our good deal here on Amazon ended up costing us plenty.  Not to mention the time we had to take away from our trip going on an unexpected shopping tip to replace the items that were ruined.  Check your vehicle, if it has exhausts that are near your bumper DO NOT BUY THIS RACK or make sure you go and get some sort of heat reflective plating ahead of time.
B004ZF35GM|5|This kit is the best HID kit I've ever purchased! The lights are bright, powerful, and are way better than the OEM Halogens I had in my Honda Civic. I purchased the 6000K color and they are bright white, almost identical to a tactical flashlight. I love them! Their customer service is top notch. They emailed me shortly after I received the kit and asked if I needed instructions on installing them or had any questions. I installed these with no issues. You don't find many companies who want to preserve that kind of customer service. I highly recommend these kits over any of the other ones I've used.
B003IS3HV0|5|Makes my leather recliner so nice;  plus waterproof.  Thanks
B005FEGP7I|3|The product work as it should, but took a while to work. Messing with the COM ports took the longest time. Do make sure you have it plugged into your cars OBDII Port before you say it does not work. I used some of the software that was on the CD and they do read the cars codes. You can do some mapping and read other sensor readouts. It would probably work so much better if you had full software.<br />At the end it is a very good product and works like it states it will.
B000BYB2K2|3|Good quality wiper, but it unhooks easily if bumped.  I constantly knock it loose when I'm cleaning the windows, and it doesn't seem to lock into the wiper arm very securely.
B00JFXXEFQ|5|Perfect fit! Mounted in the bumper with ease, wiring harness worked like a charm! Love the light output!
B002NZWGWK|5|The hitch arrived on time and in great condition. After installation, it looked perfect underneath my Prius. Could not be happier.
B004PEB23G|5|It will take you a minimum of 48 man hours to install on a 2006 Magnum.  If you order, have it shipped next day.  Yes, it will cost you more, but there will be no chance of anything being pilfered as the kit goes through the Memphis Airport.  PM (cal.clack@gmail.com)if you want hints, shots of what goes where (instructions leave out key information).  Other than that, it was a fun project and definitely doable if you have a rack and time.
B003PERH9K|5|Just got in the mail today. Suprised me it was delivered in a  envelolpe but everything is as expected. Havent put it on my car yet but I fully plan to !
B00RRBP460|5|ACTUAL GREEN LIGHT! not the blue green crap you get from some other sellers. used to replace my side marker lights (HAD TO REMOVE CAREFULLY PLASTIC CAP WITH PLYERS TO MAKE FIT.) and they will light up the side of a house when i drive by! very bright!!! *edit* 10 months later and still working perfectly! no flicker, no burn out. got a police complaint at one point because i was parked outside someones house with them on and it woke them up xD
B004UN802S|5|It was a bit pricey for the material it is made from but for my car it is perfect. I would buy it again. Took a little doing to install it properly but once we figured that it we were good to go. I have a manual transmission and was worried that it would interfere with my ability to shift. it doesn't. It is the perfect height for my elbo to rest on. Now  that I have it, I can't imagine going without it.
B00H34DMME|1|Don't function
B0038B7IJE|4|Excelente producto, iluminaci&oacute;n y estetica, sin embargo no encaja muy bien con la base de la carrocer&iacute;a, la descripci&oacute;n del producto no indica si es para versi&oacute;n Americana o Japonesa, lo que podria ser un inconveniente para el montaje.
B00029KC2A|5|I used this as a heat shield for a motorcycle pannier that sat over the exhaust. It gets rained on and covered in road dirt, keeps sticking and does its job well.
B000CPI5Z0|5|My car 9 yrs old car used to have three minor problems:<br />1) minor uneven cylinder firing on idle (minor engine vibration on idle)<br />2) the auto transmission was frequently jerking when downshifting from the second to the first gear<br />3) emission system issue P0420 Catalyst Efficiency Below Threshold Bank (check engine light); BTW the car has recently passed the smog check w/o any issues<br /><br />After I used this bottle with 10 gallons of of Shell 89 gasoline the severity of symptoms decreased.<br />1) engine idle smooth<br />2) much less frequently jerking while AT downshifting, but still happens<br />3) less frequent check engine light, but it still happens (this light goes on and off every month)<br /><br />Gas mileage is the same - no change before / after.<br /><br />For this car i always used Shell 89 gasoline, Pennzoil full synthetic oil every 5,000 miles and Subaru OEM oil filter with pressure valve inside.
B0002JMEQW|2|Uses too much solvent and doesn't clean very well. I tried different air pressures with no improvement. For years I thought I wanted one but now, I wish I hadn't bought it because the system I built works way better with less solvent.
B004SR8B16|5|Excellent product nad delivered on time.
B000GTWGB6|5|Excellent pads wet or dry
B001GRX648|5|These are easy to install and sound great. My Cobra exhaust was stripped by the previous owner and I wanted to dampen the sound a little. These retain the mean low sound and help eliminate the popping back draft sound.
B00FJ6AFP0|4|It's a little flimsy but it does the job for an affordable price. U-C-F Knights goooo Knights!
B009RBGS9U|3|Picture showed install kit (harness, zip tie, foam and snap washer) and never got it in the box.<br /><br />Pretty bummed, considering that the &#34;picture is for illustration only.&#34;<br /><br />Make sure you BUY THE INSTALLATION KIT.<br /><br />Really should put that in the description and remove the image from the search results page.
B000CITK8S|1|This Battery Tender quit working and was so hot I could not pick it up. I had it hooked up to my Honda generator. When I checked it, the red light was on and the tender the plug in unit was hot. I immediately unplugged it. I checked it every week. This tender unit could have easily started a fire. I bought it on 7-16-14 and the warranty expired on 8-18-15.
B00O83TSTO|3|Socket notches did not match up with the lites on the truck
B00KID1VAM|5|Excellent pice fit perfectly shipped fast i wanted something nice but not stick out that's why I bought the black one and fast shipping was a must because when I went to take the bike out for the first time this year my original was missing very happy with the product would definitely buy again
B0007RDVFM|5|great product. I use it after every car wash. I have a candy apple red 2012 mustang. I go to many car shows. I get a thumbs up wherever I go.
B004KL0I9I|4|Paired right up with my Evo 4G/Torque on my Aveo. Hasn't dropped out or had any connection issues yet! The only gripe I have is that the thing is MASSIVE. I was expecting it to be maybe 2 inches long, but it's definitely closer to 4, as listed in the product details section (which I should have read before ordering it.)
B000CQHU0U|4|My biggest problem was getting the components (new exhaust pipe, hangers, clamps and tailpipe) to line up without chatter. Unit installed and functioning.
B0056DFPM4|5|Very good quality sticker and exactly what I expected to receive. Looks great on my back window.
B007TY0CVM|1|not good quality
B003U4RS1M|5|I had loud valve tapping/knocking.  Added valve clean. Gone within one drive down the road.  2000 323i BMW. Works. Wonder how long it lasts...
B0097ND7TW|5|works / fits as expected
B001KR574Q|5|The clutch was great in my 04 focus SVT...but about 3 weeks after I had it put in, I wrecked the car. The clutch was tight and worked great till then though haha
B00KFQJE5G|4|Love them, super small snd super bright!!
B00AWRFAHY|5|I use this cleaner all the time. This product does a good job! Keeps your plastic looking new. I use 210 at least once a week.
B00KTHZJ1O|5|Perfect
B00540BMZS|5|I have a 2003 Camry and this fits ok but not perfect.  Nevertheless it does the job and is very easy to hinge into place or totally move out of the way.  It takes up very littlest space when stored
B00L2SK360|1|Horrible
B00335HEEO|4|Seems to do the job had a little gap the adhesive did not quite seal but it is hardly noticeable and it has survived two carwashes and around 1000 miles of driving so far.
B004YWVG30|3|I ordered this cover as the web description said Car & SUV Large Size. The length was compatible to the length of my SUV. The cover arrived very quickly and I could see that the quality was very good. However on trying it out it was evident this cover was for a sedan and not a SUV. The skirt was far too short and the profile of the cover was 'sedan shaped' Impossible to fit to a SUV shape so had to return the cover - no problems in that regard
B000JZWRJS|5|Perfect replacement for my broken lift supports. I had the old ones off and the new ones on in under 5 minutes. Now I don't have to hold the boot open with my head! :D
B0036U02WM|4|Top windshield is easy to remove and store if more air is needed. Installation was basic and straight up. Quality was higher than expected.
B005C2ACBI|5|Bought these to add to my collection.  The big hooks are easy to attach to the truck and the coating helps protect things that might scratch.  The ratchet tightens down the load easily.  Having the webbing retract is fantastic. It makes them easy to stow and saves effort when bringing them out to use.
B001F0IELG|4|Only one problem some one opened the package and it was missing two bolts.  Lucky the person that was installing this for me was a pack rat and had the extra bolts I needed although I had to pay for the bolts.  The Fulton works great..
B009DJSLUU|5|I purchased this part in particular because the mechanic I was working with said a new one from the dealership could run almost $150. It was very easy to find and with Amazon's car match guide for parts I was confident in the purchase. The part was here quick and my mechanic said it fit perfectly. I would have no problem purchasing from Evan-Fishcher in the future and I have since then done a lot of updating on my vehicle since I purchased this first part, all with the help with Amazon's auto department of course!
B005LDBU0U|5|As comfortable as it is, I admittedly don't use the Airhawk R for my daily commute or running errands for fear that it will disappear while my ride is parked. But (no pun intended), the Airhawk R is ahhhhhhh-some. On long rides I would I'd find myself shifting my weight for backside relief; however, all the weight shifting in the world won't minimize the numbness that male riders can experience. The AHR completely alleviated the numbness and made the ride cooler.
B007KCXG6Q|5|Arrived on time and in good condition. 2 minute install. Greatly improved the look of the front light/grill assembly on my 2005 Silverado. Replaced the old,grungy,parklights that collected moisture. Highly recommend this product. Inexpensive and easy upgrade.
B006E4L4Q0|3|Came nicely packed and fast, had some troubles cutting and fitting, other than that it looks good.
B008RQGIO6|3|I love the appearance, however the sewing was poor. The attaching strips ripped off and fortunately I had the skill to re-attach them.  If you can't sew, don't buy these.
B0033WNJBO|4|Easy to install once you make the hole large enough to get the bolts inside the frame. Fit is good.
B0088BCIRQ|5|I am trying these out in my Polaris 800 Sportsman. I can really tell a difference in throttle reaction. They are suppose to overall have several good aspects relating to power as well as economy savings. They are fairly pricy, but I wanted to see what difference they would make in my bike. So far....I like what I've experienced. I'd recommend these to anyone.
B000IYYUKO|5|Works like a thermostat
B0032W3KFK|5|its very kool to have , worth the $300 , the fact that i hate the super glow gauges that really hurt my eyes after a long drive at night , this came as a perfect replacement for the \\" dark ages\\" gauges ...
B00D7VRXB8|4|What can I say, its a cargo net.<br /><br />Fits OK, have put lots of things in it, holds everything in place. -1 star for it not staying on the bottom hooks to the car. I bought cheap (like $1 for 3) carabiners to hold the net to the hooks on the car, works with no issues.
B000BK9JO2|5|Looks great. Only took me about 20 minutes to install. Helps out on gas mileage if you do a lot of highway driving
B000CNB4PU|4|I bought this to solve the front-end slop and noise typical on the Escapes.  Works well.  Grease fittings regularly
B00471TN1U|1|I bought these and put them on my ML350. They looked good, however, they rusted on and corroded the valve stems.<br />I just had to spend $150.00 to have my valve stems all replaced!<br />Two of the stems broke off due to the corrosion.<br />This is a terrible product. Save your money.
B003T0YT78|5|I have ordered other Eagle Eyes products and all of them have been great.<br />These even come with bulbs installed. Just one screw and a pull to get the old one out, unplug two plugs, plug into the new one, put back in the hole and put the screw back in. I think it took all of about 5 minutes. New one works and looks great. Good shipping time and a whole lot cheaper that the dealer price.
B000C53QB8|1|you sent me the wrong shocks for the front and rear I told you I have a 2 wheel drive But you sent me shocks for a 4 wheel drive then you would not let me return them because you said it had been to long after I told you I had spent 30 days in the hospital very sick then I had to sell them on crags list to get my money back to buy more shocks from Advance Auto Parts. you sure put me in a jam I did not hate the shocks I hated what you did to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00N4WIAE4|4|Turned out awesome sprayed two complete vehicles
B004VY6M3A|5|I bought a new car and had been looking all over for a trash bag (being a mom of a toddler, it is a must!) but all I was finding was boring, black trash bags that looked dated and used special sized trash bags (or non at all...ick!) and were not very functional.  I was very excited when I found The Mod Mobile and hoped that once I received the trash bag in the mail it would finally be what I was looking for.  It was!  I absolutely love it...the design is cute and the hard plastic insert for the inside keeps the top open so I can use it one-handed and on the go!  I also love that it uses the doggie bags that we already had in the house and are using with our dog so we don't have to go out and find some new sized bag to buy.  The size is perfect - it holds about a weeks worth of small wrappers, etc. and hangs on the back of my passenger seat but does not interfere with the pocket or leg room for back-seat riders.  I also like its versatility of being able to be used on the gear shift or other areas if I change my mind.  Overall a great idea and a great purchase - I have already blabbed about it on Facebook to all of my friends and will continue to recommend The Mod Mobile to everyone I know!  I hope they continue to expand their inventory so I can find new fun things to buy for my car :)
B00S8KBABM|1|These were the worst seal beamed headlights i have ever bought the projector does not project no more than 4 feet and halo light went out and water went in!
B007FTMI4U|5|Great pads work excellent as long as no lube touches them, last long this is my second set.  Would recommend.
B003K3GO5Y|3|Just received this as a gift for my father, and am sure I will be happy with the quality, however the listing is somewhat deceptive.<br />It calls it a KIT and the default picture is of 4 brake lines, and I KNOW I KNOW it says its front only under vehicle specific, I didnt catch that when I ordered. So I ordered under the presumption that KIT meant all 4 lines, and am somewhat disappointed by that. I wish id read more carefully but maybe this review will help the seller improve the listing for other buyers in future orders.
B006TJJDCC|1|Don't waste your money! Doesn't work at all like it says it should! Didn't warm up the car and the fan didn't blow at all!
B001GH1NPM|5|I got today my daystar kit for my F-250 and this stuff looks awesome... for sure they will do a nice job.
B000CGGPF6|4|I wanted this hitch to fit a 09 Ford Focus and got one for a 07 Focus .My friend was not happy in drilling into his car cause the hitch that was ordered said no drlling required.We got the hitch on and seemes to be working well with little bit of modifying,otherwise seemes happy with the purchase.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Nothing bad to say here.  The delivery was fast, the price was great, the fitment was perfect.  As long as it lasts awhile and proves to be good quality, I'll be a happy camper!
B001KP6LQQ|5|Replaced both lift supports. Exact fit. Just replacing the one side held the hood up. Replaced both though. They work really well. Very happy with purchase.<br />Fast shipping too.
B009TAWAFU|3|The product fits relatively well, but the color clashes, I have an Infiniti FX35 with a Wheat Interior, the pics look like a good match, but it really isn't, the mats are more light brown or off tone, it's not beige which I was expecting, but it wasn't worth shipping back for the price....
B000YR0BLM|5|Inexpensive and high quality.
B003FBV8ZW|5|very nice and comfortable, value for money def a 5 stars item
B008K4BM8M|5|works great. no complaints.
B006EGAIII|5|Use these every time I do anything with my car and truck! Love them and is so much easier than jacking my car up!
B0019SF5KC|5|Great handy present good price
B0016HPUS8|5|Just like the original. Aluminum block + aluminum fitting = same expansion. Get this and not one with a brass base. DO NOT OVER TIGHTENT. This has thread locker and a crush washer, it seals great with just a little torque. I expect it will last 140k miles or so, just like the 1st.
B00062YZXU|4|Item was hard to install but worked out OK! Item arrived promptly as described. The packaging was &#34;terrible&#34;! The box the film was in was creased in the middle. The outer shipping box was also damaged, (which ultimately caused the package on the inside to be crushed)!
B00269HEKM|5|The above described cord is used for my trailer at home, beside the house and performs exactly as expected and at a great price.
B00INZ65B2|5|I installed the six stepper motors into the dash cluster and used the needle pulling tool that was supplied without any problems what so ever! The de soldering and soldering back was the hardest part for me but I had some experience in the past and I practiced a little before starting as suggested! I found no dash bulbs out so I still have the spares. It is a nice idea to include them in the kit. My truck's dash is good as new now!
B00T5DK25G|1|My driver seat ripped easy on the seam
B00CCYWMYO|5|Good stuff! Cleaned my 10 year old tank sensors with one dose.
B0012TYYRI|4|Fit well. Worked great. Friend bought one and liked it too. Used for a winter running race in Minnesota 2013.
B000VHXD8I|4|I like these tools, the bits work good but the case needs to be made so the bits don't fall out of place when you open it.
B003M9J2OG|1|anything i say will be very bad bicos i was invited to buy this product, it was'nt the right one for my car.  To add insult to injuries amazon sent the useless product twice and I am surpose to pay for them. despite I return one and refused to to take delivery of  the other one, I was billed for both.
B000FQ1HM4|5|Very simple install. All wires are marked perfectly. Cuts off exactly off 110 pounds. Perfect for any on board air system.
B009YKGB2I|5|Excellent worked as advertised.  Prompt delivery.
B00BMU9CEM|1|A huge chunk of the wheel came off as soon as I started on decal.
B0007ZCMU4|5|We needed these boot covers for a last minute costume issue, and thy worked perfectly! The coverages fit perfectly - no snags, no puckers.
B0026M9BDC|5|Worked like it said it would.  Easy install on my 03 S10.  Seems way better than that stock junk I replaced.
B006QH561E|5|One of the best prices around here on Amazon. This battery is the best. I have it running in my Cherokee XJ (this bad Larry sucks a lot of juice) and have not had a problem yet, (even with running an 6.5K winch).
B00FLNKVYQ|5|the guy i work with has the florescent version of this light and i was worried that this would not be as bright but we compared them side by side and they are just about equal in brightness i like the led one its smaller in size to the florescent one i like it so far
B0033078ZY|5|Works great with my supercharger.  I would recommend these to anyone that is boosted.  I don't have many miles on them yet ~500 miles but not a single problem with a missfire.
B005N6WXYM|5|This item is excellent and works perfectly for my jeep's snorkel!!  Thank you. 👍👍
B002692308|5|exact fit
B00A1FKIGA|1|Terrible purchase - one of worst I ever made.  Worked erratically, which made it dangerous to use on the highway (I checked the batteries and they were fine).  Also the magnets not strong enough to remain stationary on the towed vehicle.  Was able to use it for only part of one 1000 mile trip since the cover guard over the antenna wire blew off at about 700 miles after which it didn't work at all.  Checked to see if there was any warranty information that came with it (I kept all the packaging material) and could not find any references to a warranty.  Went to the Eurow website and could find no reference to a warranty there either.  A complete waste of money - in fact even worse than that when one considers the inconvenience of having to stop and check frequently on its operation and the involved safety issues.  Fortunately I had with me an older magnetic unit (not wireless) as a backup.  That got me back home.
B00AN9WMFY|4|Don't like is much as all chrome color but its still nice.
B000C2GE6K|5|high quality good price
B000FG4C6W|5|Ok
B00KXHGER8|5|Fits perfectly!  Very satisfied with this product
B004TYJ3GU|3|Not as robust as they describe and Magnum Tuning Tech Support leaves a lot to be desired.They have no number to call, 24/7 my ass! it's all done by submitting an email through their website and good luck with that. I did it on Sunday June 16th, today is June 21st 11:30PM and STILL no response from Magnum Tuning. What I needed to know what was the correct Air Intake Sensor signal sending wire to tap into, their directions say to locate it and attach the 2 purple wires to it. Well there happens to be several wires on the Air Intake Sensor! How was I supposed to know which one was the one that sent the signal to the boats' computer? So I tried to reach their tech support. Hahahahaha what a joke. Will NEVER purchase from Magnum Tuning again, bank on that.
B003HIJE90|1|It threw my check engine light and now it won't go off. Should have gotten one for dodge. And tech from bbk won't even answer my email!
B000CQDON2|5|This product worked fine for mounting a winch on my 1949 Willys CJ2A Jeep. I called Warn to make sure it would fit before I ordered it. Great quality and finish.
B000MFV50C|5|Great the tools are of suprising quality and the tire pump seems to be perfectly sturdy and useable its a good size everything is well kept in the bag and im very happy with it however the 77 piece or whatver they say is misleading beacause the bandaids in the first aid kit each count as one piece but dont let that deter you its great
B0031XK5QC|4|Fixed my problem ...... refrigerator stays on now,  I do think Norcold should have replaced these for free since they recomended this replacement set, indicating that the original contacts on original wires were at fault...
B0012WKCNK|5|nice item as described
B003V57NUQ|3|Works well once put together. Rating 3/5 based on the difficulty of assembly. Bolt holes in the racks were slightly misaligned, resulting in additional filing/shaving to allow for the bolts to fit properly. Other than that, can't beat the price when compared to others.
B00P99KKAM|5|One thing I noticed about an old steering wheel cover I had was the fact that it didn’t slide through my hands.  It was one of those sticky type of affairs and I ended up taking a pass on it.  My husband had one years ago and was anxious to try this one out.  Installation on a smaller steering wheel is easy, but for a larger truck it was very difficult.  This steering wheel cover is made of a breathable mesh alternating with silicone for a decent grip.<br /><br />The silicone will keep the cover from shifting, something I definitely don’t need when driving.  The black and red color combination is certainly eye-popping and will work well in a car you might want to jazz up a bit.  I do like this much better than the plain leather-like ones that can get rather drab and grungy after a while.  It doesn’t say, but with this type of material it’s probably hand washable.<br /><br />The quality is high and there’s no off smell about it when I opened up the package.  Once I installed it in my car, it gave the wheel a nice cushy feeling rather than the hard one my steering wheel has.  My husband really wanted it for his Ford F150, but didn’t have the patience to try to get it on the wheel.  This is a one-size-fits-all, but if you are putting it in a larger truck, simply be prepared for a struggle.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.
B007UHPSBM|2|Suction cup ripped of when first used.  After securing, finally in wind, came out the next morning to find it frozen to my windshield.  I now use it as a floor liner beneath the floor mats in truck to protect the carpet from salt and snow.  Works great!
B002KCKQZU|5|You can feel the difference good product.
B000COB5NK|5|People spoke of the cables being different lengths.  Mine were also, but the diference was almost negligible.  I considering ordering 1 more and sending the different length one back, but when I installed them and lowered the tailgate they were both taut.
B00DZI5DGK|5|I love this helmet. It fits snug, but comfortable. The design is awesome too!
B000CN9UVU|5|Factory camber (front) is non-adjustable. This is an awesome solution to non-adjustable factory camber.  IF you lower your Nissan Sentra with conventional springs, rather than fully camber adjustable coilovers, negative camber will make your steering twitchy and the car will &#34;dart&#34;.  For less than $50 you can install these in about 15 minutes (assuming proper tools) and they are easy to adjust bi-laterally.  These can provide a LOT of negative camber, perfect for you boy racers (and girls!) that will sacrifice a bit of comfort for more control and stick.  The other solution is expensive camber plates that adjust from the top (under the hood).  That would be great, probably even better than these, which require wheel removal to adjust. These look NOTHING like the accompanying photo.  They are just two nuts with bolts that have an offset (eccentric) center.  Made better by a great price from amazon and Amazon prime free shipping!
B0007TQWJM|5|Works perfect for our boat trailer! Highly recommend
B0050VFA8G|5|i use this to keep the kids gadgets going on trips over an hour or two... it has 2 wall outlet plugs that will power most anything short of a toast... and if you use the battery jumpers that come with it you can get alot more power (i havent tried those myself)
B000KPU8MK|5|I had used other Electrical Circuit Testers; however, this power probe III is really an ultimate tester.  I would recommend this to my friends.
B001GDJGJQ|5|Better than I expected. Well made, firm not flimsy
B002XQ1OP4|1|Straps where different lengths and one strap was missing the the sewn end. I would not recommend this
B00L3KDUD0|5|Very pleased with this purchase. The different sizes help to reach all the visible surfaces as well as some of the harder to reach areas throughout the wheels.
B000BWE38W|4|Great- car runs better now that I can customize my curve. My only gripe is that the vacuum advance units require a 2.5mm allen key to adjust the vacuum can, and that is a rare size for any kit. It would be cheap enough to include one in this kit. (1600 dual port Volkswagen Bus- grey/grey springs and 18* mechanical advance allowed. 4-5* vacuum advance.)
B001W6LGGS|5|Follow up:  I also wired into the lights versus back up lights.  Always on when lights are on.  Works as a great review mirror.<br /><br />Only difficulty was mounting to my Dodge Ram pickup.  The tail gate would not allow a license plate mount.  Mounted to my canopy.  Made a sun and rain shield and it works great.
B00908WGCI|5|What can I say?  It's a vinyl sticker that sticks on the car and looks great!  The biggest problem with vinyl stickers like this is sometimes the vinyl cutter depth isn't set right, so it either cuts too far through the vinyl or not far enough.  This was perfect and it applied with any issues on my car.
B009SR04SO|5|Worked we'll and a great price for a regulator. I was having problems with my atv I converted to fuel injection using a kit from ecotrons dot com. After getting this installed it worked perfectly.
B007B40ZW6|5|Nice decal.  Time will tell if it holds up.  I put it on my back window of our car.  The colors are accurate to the actual crest colors.  Nice job
B000KEEMUK|5|Great Thanks
B0050NGB32|3|Helps to get some extra height and not have to crank as much to get the trailer off of the car/truck/SUV.<br />Holds a lot ow water; one hole in the bottom fixed that.<br />Diameter leads to some wobble in the connection.
B000C2SD6Y|5|Not much to say about an o-ring. Worked great, fit great, looked great. I'm just glad it was ok so that I didn't have to go locally and buy another. Thank you.
B000FQ968Q|5|Worked perfectly following the instructions.
B005FKS4VC|5|All the difference in the world! great performance brakes.
B00120EXOQ|4|They look nice
B0073MEWS4|5|Bought this for a chevrolet venture 1998 and was a perfect fit, the shipment was fast and so far working great.
B00E6ABYNM|5|It looks like the picture and sticks to the car.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Great lights
B007R6JQ6O|5|It fit good
B00D0IA5TU|5|There were some poor reviews so I kept on searching the local junkyards until the rain coming made it imperative I do something.  I think this is a well made product and it does a good job of replacing the OEM arm.  It is adjustable so it is use on multiple cars but who cares, it works.
B000E4PVCY|5|part arrived on time and is of good quality.
B009PAK75E|5|This set is a great value! They fit perfect and look great! I always get compliments on them even from strangers! you can't beat the price! The only thing is you need to make slits for seat belts. Real easy to do with a box cutter once the are on.
B00BALUJLS|5|Functions perfectly and bolted up with no problems..
B000NSL2CO|5|Nice work guys! Enjoying it so far.
B00192QB3I|5|If  you have an RV cable that you may want or need to use as a standard extension cord this works great for the female end.
B00DDOSKBG|5|These are great. I used them to replace all of the internal lights in my RV. They are bright, use a lot less energy, and do not get warm.
B00CFCI404|3|Overall good quality product, but it is a little bit of a hassle to trim the &#34;excess&#34; to have a custom fit, but once you get it right it's a perfect fit on the front mats, the back mats are a bit tight fit specially if you want to keep the original mats below them.
B0041K13LA|4|Very handy pocket to have on your dash. It keeps your phone, glasses and such within reach, lessens distraction time while driving. I do love it. The way it attaches is cool but you must make sure that you have it securely attached. It fits well on the dash/heating vent in my husband's Nissan truck but not as well in my Honda Civic. Nevertheless I would highly recommend this product with its multiple pockets and sturdy construction. Well worth the price!
B000637TFU|5|Just got these today; Lexol is the PREMIUM leather conditioner on the market today. These are shipped as 100 individually packaged moistened towelettes. Each towelette can cover 1 bucket seat; so you'll use 3 -4 when doing your interior's leather, BUT, the beauty is no more overspray on your dash or vinyl from spraying it on your seats. Each towelette comes with a heavy dose of Lexol for a nice coat on whatever your conditioning. Great Product
B000EGNAW0|5|Great finish and fit. Heavy sidewall. Looks like it will last a while and for the price who cares!?
B005FUUBZO|5|I bought this product before 4 months, still working 👍
B000VEIY62|3|It fits my 2008 honda well, however it is made from a very thin plastic. It looks very nice, but i am concerned about how it will hold up.
B000N253RA|5|Great addition; Noticed increased performance right away. Sounds great. Install was easy, took about 1hr and it looks great under the hood.
B007TYL766|5|This product was exactly as described and matches the OEM part perfectly. I cannot comment on the nature of the electrical connection because we opted to leave the undamaged original wiring sockets and bulbs in place.
B00BCI8WHC|1|Not so much ......the lenses are silver not clear .I would not wear them .VERY, VERY VERY cheap ....Junk .
B006V7TBBA|1|Defective lights , I work 2 jobs just finally got the chance to install these lights , this is my second KC lights that I had installed , I am glad that Amazon really takes good care of their customer  and listen to my request for exchange since there is no way to find out in advance if the lights really work not until you hook up the wirings . I am willing to give this brand another try and hoping second time it does work. Thanks again to Amazon for excellent customer service.
B00KJO4198|4|Work great on the filter.
B000CITKCE|5|This little guy works great. Mounted to the firewall in the engine compartment of my RV. Wire tied the leads and power cord in convenient and safe position for ease of access. Dead battery no more!
B0049YBUVQ|5|Same kits sold by parts stores for much more. Can't go wrong on these!! Great deal!!
B000BZGLIY|5|Working great on my BMW 2002. Quality part, fit right, no issues!
B000B6JJUK|5|I was bit unsure reading others' reviews if the tip won't fit perfect and I might have problem getting accurate data.<br /><br />BUT, it works awesome. Easy and Accurate.
B001DC7L42|4|Have used the &#34;green light changer&#34; brand before and it seemed to work better than this model. It fell off somewhere on my journey and needed to replace it so I ordered the &#34;traffic light changer&#34;. Its hard to tell if its working or not, still some stubborn left turn arrows in my area it won't change but I think its worked on a few others. Regardless, for the money its well worth keeping on your motorcycle &#34;just in case&#34; !!
B0053ZJ1ES|5|ive had this on my car almost a year and its not fading at all. loks super good and its great quality too
B000AMBOX0|5|I went to ace hardware and told the guys I wanted something simple but effective.  The two Ace fellas choose this at the same time.  They said hose the car wash with the Turtly Wax and wipe off! Your car will be clean and really shine.  THEY WERE RIGHT.
B00AA2HWG8|5|Easy install, quality workmanship.  Might need to take a shaver to reduce the pile, but that's personal preference.
B00J3DGUEA|5|I was pleased with this dash cover. And it is very nicely sewn. It fits just right on the dashboard of my 944 Porsche.
B008I7R6U4|4|good
B00DSD6SRK|5|Awesome Unique Classic Original Nirvana Rock Band sticker.  100% original and puts a smile on my face.  The Black is the exact perfect Black color.  It blended in perfect with my Black car.  It's hard to tell if it's a sticker or if it was painted on my car.  See the attached pics.<br /><br />Looking at this brings me back to the time in my life when I was a Teenager and Nirvana was a big influence to me and how awesome the music was, amongst other things.  Lots of great memories and now random conversations with people asking about it and reminiscing with not just my friends but also with just about anyone who sees it and says something about it and sharing their own stories and experience.<br /><br />Thanks to the seller for providing an awesome genuine Symbol! Hope to see more.  With there was a way to chose a seller to add to &#34;Favorites&#34; list, like Wish list
B00PHR6R1W|5|That light work good, and is water proof, very bright, I bought 4.
B006YDE7Z6|1|Looking at the pictures for this item showed open ended grips. What I got was closed end grips with a hard compound rubber and different pattern than what was shown. My bike has bar ends so these grips and throttle housing are useless to me.  The grips are very cheap looking and feeling. I will be sending these back.
B00DU0E53A|5|I really like the jacket. It looks & feels good all at an extremely reasonable price.
B00872US7I|5|He wore his last hat until it fell off his head he loved it so much.  He loves this one more
B003550RLE|5|great item and an easy install for sub to rear speaker, hate that i have to use required words to rate this items.
B000COCTXA|4|Couldn't get the sprayer to go quite as high as I wanted but it mostly hits the windshield and has a really good spread so no complaints here.
B002WQHY9K|3|Sadly, the contents in the can ran empty before completing the fourth wheel I intended to clean.  Maybe i needed two cans after all but nonetheless I expected this can to be sufficient.
B000HA9OI2|5|muy buen producto es perfecto tal como se describe. . . . . . . . . . . .
B005C4FIN8|5|They're somewhat small, but they're good looking and sturdy.
B001N2WDGI|5|brought some life into my GMC 2.2L inline 4 banger.
B00877SL2M|5|excellent I work on my Mitsubishi L200 2008 was adjusted to perfection in lights W5W
B003XTWP8K|4|The sissy bar bag fits well and is quality manufactured. Only downside? My friend saw it and said &#34;It looks like you attached a mailbox on the back of your motorcycle!&#34;
B00BMVPSQC|5|This is a very nice set of seat covers especially for a generic product.  The company works well with you also if you have an issue.  We only had a bit of trouble installing the bucket seat cover but we got it done we some ingenuity.  I don't think you will be disappointed with the quality or price!  My daughter loves them and gets many complements.  The colors are beautiful.
B006TMKJ9A|5|Good fit and finish. Looks just like the original.<br />Note: This doesn't come with the little keeper button at the top.
B008LY18EE|5|thank you amazon for the offers a a new customer.  works great. thank you Rare electrical also
B00809XNCA|5|My car does not have this as I found out when I tried to install it but the filter was in excellent shape...
B00335JMTY|4|Floormats work great. Decent gap between console and mat as well as uncovered area between the door and seat. Overall great product
B00K65HHAK|3|It's ok . Is not really what I spect  I don't really see the difference with chip and without it .
B002IV4ZW8|4|The package came open and it was missing two sets of keys. Only one set of keys in the package. Awesome locks.
B00E5Z9TGM|1|Well, you get what you pay for. The light works. The power button is conveniently located where you hold the light so you are continually turning it off when you really don't want to. The cord comes out the back of the handle instead of the end which makes it not conducive to tight places. On the bottom where the cord should be they have a magnet, good concept except it is too weak to keep the light where you stick it. It only kinda works if the light is vertical and there are no strong breezes, forget about the magnet holding the light sideways or upside down. Bottom line, it is better than a candle... or no light at all.<br />UPDATE, Down rating to one star, it is just to frustrating to use to be an asset. I was trying to use the light the other day and the clear plastic cover over the LEDs started falling off, no reason, I checked the little tabs that clip it on and they are all there and not broken. I finally got tired of picking it up and putting it back on so I just set it to the side. I am thinking of cannibalizing the parts out of this unit for some other projects.
B001C6N79C|5|Great replacement part
B00F2GU6U6|3|Have not received the l.e.d strips
B007HZ70BS|5|bright
B001Q4OXHU|3|Yeah, it definitely doesn't sit back as far as you would want for a Polaris receiver but it gets the job done.  It is well made, it just needs better hole placement to fit snugly in the Polaris Sportsman receiver.
B000ALDQDC|5|Fit perfectly, I buy from you again. This saved my but.
B005IQYFF2|5|Although I am not a a Tea Party person, I am a Patriot and believe in what the words on this frame stand for. This frame is as described. It was easy to install on my car and stands out for its meaning.
B00BMRRXU0|4|Smallest size fits a little snug but it definetley does the truck. We put it in our camper to save the screen from the dogs.
B005FI1MAO|5|great product
B000BRJOW2|5|This cover appears to be durable and of good quality material. It fits twin 30lb cylinders very well. Access to the valves is convenient. It eliminated a clearance problem with my electric A Frame jack. Excellent problem solver.
B002QGVW3K|1|Lasted 2 months
B00AZ4QYRE|5|Love these rain guard deflectors! I can keep my windows slightly cracked, to cool my car in the sun, with these on. When it rains, the drops don't go into the car unless the window is further down. Plus, they match my window tint..cool!
B0009IBJCQ|5|This fine product is one of the good ones leftover from the metal age. It does just what it is supposed to do, charge my battery. It does it efficiently, quietly and thoroughly. Nothing else need be said.
B000I14RY6|5|After wrestling with my wipers for days, this little beauty popped both out within 10 minutes. If you have seemingly glued on wipers arms, this is the tool for you!
B004SH5J34|2|Installer at tire shop said the Redi-sensor was not compatible with my vechile [2008] chevrolet avalanche I would not recommend
B0002KO10I|5|Great
B001D20X4W|5|great quality and fit
B00CIYDKN0|1|I brought this part for my ML320 about a month back and it already failed ahout 2 weeks after being installed. I was driving down the freeway and it just stopped accelerating and I had to coast off the road and check it. I took out my diagnostic machine and checked it and it said that it was weak and failing.
B004ET9B5S|5|Very easy installation.  Really made a difference in the turbo sound in my truck.  Fit very well in stock filter location.
B0009H636Y|2|Very cheap filter media. Definitely this is aftermarket.
B003902UWO|5|I like this tray. I've changed out serpentine belts and unbolted various things on my engine. To make sure things dont drop into the engine bay I place it in the tray.  I've sticked this thing upside down on the underside of my hood while I work on the engine, and even place my wrenches in there.  NOTHING FALLS OUT.  Very convenient product.
B000E83D6G|3|This product arrived on time per PRIME delivery.  This is currently being used in a Toyota 4Runner.  It organizes a bunch of small items and seems quite sturdy.  It doesn't bounce around the trunk which is perfect for our needs.  It was smaller than I thought it would be.  Make sure to read your dimmensions/sizes.  I think I didn't pay close enough attention to this.  It is of good quality - just not that big.
B005BTAIVQ|5|Nice

B0049984HE|5|These filters seem like off brands but I thought I would give it a try. I bought a box of these and after the first one on the car I cut it open and was surprised it was as well as constructed as the expensive brands.
B000JKB3IO|5|Great product. Easy intall. Can paint any color. Keeps your wheels clean. I definately recommend them.
B000XQ9MGE|5|We have a four cylinder 95 Buick Century, and with the arctic blast we got this winter (Michigan), it killed our battery. When temps got above freezing over this last weekend we tried this little beauty out, and the car started right up. I recommend this product to anyone with a four cylinder car who doesn't have enough cold cranking amps in their battery.  I love it, love it, love it!
B00ASY5PBC|5|Not many (or any really) choices when it came to replacement air springs. Shipping was quick, customer service was great. Product appears high quality and installed as described.
B00FB3MT7S|5|Classy
B000G72UOQ|2|Worked surprisingly well for flimsy looking silver cloth material.  Really kept the black leather of my Acura MDX cool in the blazing summer sun for a while.  After a couple months something happened to the metal wire that frames one of the sunshade cause it stopped folding right.  One sunshade would still fold into itself so I could tuck it away, but the other sunshade became stiff or something and stopped folding well.  Then that same metal wire frame started poking out of the border of the cloth material of the sunshade and started stabbing me and my husband whenever we'd  go to fold it.  About a month after that, the frame didn't just poke out a little, it came ALL the way out and so we had to throw it away.  Sadly a couple days ago I discovered the one sad remaining sunshade has a frame poking through a little bit so I'm guessing I'm gonna get another week or two of use before that one goes kaput too.  Got a total of 3 months use out of these sunshades.  What a waste of money.
B00AR9239A|1|POS! installed on my sons 300ex, he rode for 30 mins, I got on it and could hear the park arcing due to lack of good connection, reached down and grabbed the new wire and barely tugged on it and it pulled apart,,very disappointing, very poor quality
B000CO7XPE|4|Bought these for my 1995 Mustang. Have just installed them and so far so good...  Hope they behave like the reviews I've read.
B0027QWNGO|5|I love this perfectly sized car trash keeper.  The zippered compartment in the bottom is great for things that my kids frequently ask for like tissue, gum and hand wipes. Only suggestion I'd have is that they should have a strap at the bottom so that it's not hanging out and in the way of the backseat passengers.
B000RNSBSS|1|Took me and two mechanics three hours to install. It showed up and it didn't fit correctly. We had to hammer one of the mounts to a different angle with a sledge hammer. So frustrating.
B005SEK9IQ|5|right off the bat i noticed a smother running engine, lower idle and faster revving!!! not kidding, I'm impressed! 2010 4runner
B002MA107S|3|These worked okay, but I much prefer the &#34;TMS KAYAKCARRIER-CP5672 Kayak Carrier.&#34; These are somewhat difficult to load the kayak on when you're by yourself even on a fairly low car. The kayak dramatically increased the height of my car where it would no longer fit under my carport. I prefer the other style where you can just slide the kayak right up the back of the car and it sits like it does in the water.
B000NPUJQC|1|Do not buy these, go get yourself some craftsman ones.  These do not hold the sockets, especially the deep sockets.
B000C9HZ9S|5|Installed on 82 El Camino with a V6. After just having bought the car, I wasn't really sure what was on it. For the price, I just like replacing things with what I KNOW is supposed to be on there. Mine was all hacked up by previous owner right at the connector. This one comes with two wires and it doesn't matter which one goes where. Crimp the connections and use some shrink tubing over them for a good finished job. Worked great for me.
B00NNFT09G|5|Fit my accord perfect. Looks like originals!
B0001MQ7DG|5|Just used this on a 5-day camping trip .  It was great not to have soggy items, to have my yogurt & cheese and iced coffee cold and ready when I wanted them ! It is not loud to operate, especially if music or a book CD is playing.  I also purchased from Amazon<br />Wagan 5 Amp AC to 12V DC Power Adapter to plug in a wall outlet, further extending the convenience.
B004A37MW2|5|Great product for the price, easy to install
B000C8XRHS|4|My vehicle uses 9011 bulbs for daytime running lights and high beam lights. I replaced driver's side 10/14 with a Phillips purchased from Amazon. It only lasted 4 months, so I decided to try Wagner. But what was in the box? The exact same Phillips bulb, with Phillips markings, codes, etc. Only difference was instead of a package made to hang in a store showing the bulb, it came in a little white box wrapped in thin foam. 4 Stars because it is correct item and fit perfectly, but it's sligtly deceptive because it's not actually a Wagner bulb. Hope it lasts longer than the first!
B008OK2ESE|2|Its already peeling of and doesnt bend or shape at all. Its a bit thick and doesnt hold up well to the weather. Im not to happy with it.
B00ATC9UZK|4|Smells great!!
B002XLHUQG|5|By far this is the best money can buy. Other brand chocks are cheeply made and will not hold up as good.
B003PZCUL4|5|REALLY CUTE I LOVE IT NICE PRODUCT!!
B00139YMUQ|5|This tire gauge is the best gauge among those I used. I especially like the 0.1 psi accuracy. The shape of the gauge is excellent too. I am keeping using. I will purchase the same one if necessary. The price that seller offered for this gauge is very reasonable. I couldn't find a lower price anymore.
B003BZD03K|5|The idiots who built this house I bought last September put the hose spigot so the end of it that you screw the hose onto is about an inch off the concrete on the patio.  This little gem very nicely solved the problem of how to hook up the hose to the faucet without standing on my head or barking my knuckles.  There are lots of other stupid things the builders did, too, but that's another story.
B000CQHX16|5|The filler works great for me.  I have a golf cart with 8 batteries and it makes filling them a snap.  Would purchase it again.
B00FW1JXGO|4|Easy to order. Lights are what they said they were when I received them. Should include better instructions on removal of factory bulbs. The rear hatch can be trickey.<br />Value was very good.
B000BRGAJ2|5|I've reviewed this item in the past, but I feel the need to review it again because this product absolutely works.<br /><br />After a radiator flush with 16 ounces of SimpleGreen and plenty of water, I loaded two of these bad boys into my cooling system before filling up with Honda OEM Type 2 coolant.<br /><br />Now, the last time I used one bottle (1oz per quart) and it it took me from 220 degrees to 197, but this time using two bottles (the recommended 2 ounces per quart of coolant) holy heck! My car is running at a balmy 186 degrees. This product absolutely works!<br /><br />More is NOT better, make sure to run the recommended two ounces per quart of coolant. When I first &#34;installed&#34; this product I used only 1 oz per quart and I netted some substantial benefits, 2 ounces definitely does the trick! If you add too much you run the risk of having your coolant foam up, and your water pump runs the risk of cavitating, not a good thing.<br /><br />All in all I'd say, why are you still reading this! Buy this now!
B001584Z1Q|5|The license frame for my wifes camero was perfect. It shipped early and was a nice suprize.
B00029KBF8|4|I like the rack but when buying it the reveiw I read said it wouldn't fit a 2010 Rav4.  I Looked but didn't see any earlier years so I bought it.  Of course it didn't fit my 2006.  I called GoFastparts.com, who Amazon is selling the rack for,  and was told they charge 20%restocking fee and wouldn't pay for shipping.  I am to say the least unhappy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005KSLZ2O|5|I bought two in the only size left not even knowing if it would fit ! My sister and I love our Saints helmets!
B00D99R19M|5|It was exact fit, came has promised and is working fine and the price wasn’t bad either considering I shopping around some.  I would remind this to anyone needed the right part fast and accurate.  Thank you so much for getting it too fast, my down time wasn’t bad and product works great.  I will keep you in mind when I need something in this nature again…  Thanks again for your prompt service.
B0002YTJDI|5|Wow this color matched up as good as it gets. Painted our 63 Fordson Super Major and the color looks great and with no runs.  No problem getting it thinned just right to spray with and I'm certainly no pro at spray painting but it worked great with me and saved me a ton of money.  Haven't put her in any tractor shows yet but she 's a beauty.  Great price I might add compared to other paint that is made for painting equipment.
B00OL4RGTY|4|They met our satisfaction and are great upgrade from the factory models
B003ZALGGO|4|Great smell, wished the smell lasted longer
B00T0WXTQG|1|thay did not dlever to my po box # like emaled them
B00JBIXO78|4|The lights arrived quickly and were well packaged. They look great, but were a bit of a pain to install. The real problem stemmed from the fact that the previous owner of my Jetta put crappy aftermarket lights in and they had messed up some of the wiring. I still need to find a splitter for the fog lamps to get those working.<br /><br />The bulbs were a little hard to find. The turn signal needs an amber bulb and the original Jetta bulbs don't work with that. After trial and error, we found the Sylvania 7507's do the trick. Even though the seller said the 3457a should work, and they don't, the seller still responded quickly and was very helpful.
B003C0189M|5|the hose is just long enough to fill the transmission on the 2nd Prius.  I hope to use this funnel every 50k miles. Good enough for the price.
B00IVIPDBO|5|Yet another winner I discovered when I was searching for a replacement for my aging CPS for my Miata! The price was well below other advertised products for the exact part. It is an exact match to OEM Mazda parts at a fraction of the price! Highly recommend AIP Electronic Products!
B00CE2L98Y|5|For those wanting their GM SUV to actually sound like a V8 as its idling and get rid of that gawdy coffee can resonator.. Replace it with this.  Sawzall through the exhaust pipe 7 3/4&#34; upstream from the rear exhaust hanger, remove the old resonator and tip, and slide this on. Use the existing hanger mount, clamp it down with the provided clamps (spot weld if you don't want it stolen later) and its done. 15 minute project. I still have very minimal exhaust noise going down the road and the chrome dual tips look so much better than that coffee can with an unpolished 90 degree turn down. Gives just the right amount of low pitched garble that is expected with a V8 on board.
B001OIVJHK|5|Very good
B004131JHK|5|Packaged really well.  Didn't come with nuts and bolts so be sure to save and reuse old ones.<br /><br />Everything lined up perfectly and installed in about 5 minutes.<br /><br />It is now the fastest window in my car.
B001W19VT2|5|Works perfectly in my vehicle trunk.  Now my wine bottles and milk don't tip over!
B009H97ZN0|5|It was just what I wanted.  I really enjoy using plexus. It work wonderfully.
B001ID3HBC|5|excellent quality, a fine tool manufactured with high precission and excellent materials. A tool for demanding and precise works. I highly recommend this brand
B002OWPVVA|4|Good product. As advertised. It is a sticker, not a static decal. I was hoping it was a static clingy one but took a chance & bought it just to see. Still a solid product.
B00DSVMCQS|5|yes
B003SRN0X6|4|Okay, felt compelled to leave this feedback since everybody else was slamming it. Vinyl is not easy to work with unless you have experience. You are trying to take something that is flat and transfer it to a curved surface.  Not only is the front bowtie pointed, it also curves from the center to top and bottom. The instructions tell you to use a hairdryer, this helps the vinyl form to the curved surface. They sent me two bowties, I totally screwed up the first one. The second one looks great. Lots of water and go slow. Follow the directions and it'll work. Don't blame the product if you screw up!
B00AFV7DI6|4|Fits well for my Ram 1500.  I don't think it's needed for the 2500 as the mirrors extend out by turning them.
B002ZBWKAU|5|Got this as a gift for my birthday. Works perfectly as advertised. Connect it to the tire, plug it in, set the pressure, and turn it on. After hitting the desired pressure, it continues to inflate a little then shuts off. Compact size is great for storing, and the power cable is plenty long enough to work with my truck. Will also get great use with my motorcycle.
B000GU3LO6|5|Excellent, good chrome, no defects, really brightens up the bike over the older OEM parts.  Direct fit on my 2003 Sportster with no issues.
B001GPB2MS|5|Much thicker plastic than the original.
B0006O2PBW|5|Great smell
B00496H4CS|4|Super, super easy installation; however, definitely do not last as long as a more premium blade such as Bosch ICON (which is what these replaced).  If I had never had the Bosch blades then I'd likely had been more satisfied.  I was spoiled, what can I say!
B000RT9C8U|3|It worked in making it to going in but would not use it too come out on real hard one .becuase it is 12 point
B00IX26VQ4|1|Worst product you can buy from Rough Country.This will not fit a 50&#34; light bar. I had to modify mine with more brackets to make it work with the 50&#34; light bar. You would need a light bar that is 48&#34; in total length if you want these brackets to work or you would have to pull/stretch the light bar apart. Or just spent a little bit more money and save the hassle.
B0012TPVC0|5|Sport, dirt,.standard, Harley. Whatever it is, you should be keeping the chain clean and lubed.<br /><br />Remeber riding a peddle bike that was new?  Now that same bike with rust on the chain?  Was harder to peddle huh. Well, that dirty chain is robbing horsepower, and as much as 10%. So on a 100 hp sportbike, thats a 10hp loss.
B0027Z2E0K|3|I brought this intended to hoist bundles of roof shingles onto my 2 story home. To my surprise how short the chain is. It's not more than 7 feet long. I guess this would have been great is I am trying to life something right over my head, but this was pretty much a useless tool for me.  When I took this out of the box, it was well greased. But even with that much grease, I had trouble pulling on the chains. They would often lock up, and would move anymore. Since this is my first hoist, it could be user error, but this is a very simple pulley system, i doubt highly that I was pulling it incorrectly since there is only 1 chain and 2 directions you could of pull.
B00HRY6SNU|3|Exact Fit on my 2006 Ford F150 XLT.  Pretty good workmanship, but my passenger side one leaked fluid already and I purchased a different type.  Have my fingers crossed that the driver side one does not break on me.
B008D6YGE4|5|Bought this for a mountain bike I recently purchased. It is by far the cheapest, most reliably looking rack I could find anywhere. At first I was afraid the secure arm would be flimsy or wobble around as I drove around but it's very sturdy. I mounted this on a 2006 Toyota Rav4 and only took about 30 minutes to install (mostly because I don't have the best tool kit). Installation is very straight forward and the instructions are easy to follow. There's only a handful of steps and it's ready to go.
B009DJT43I|5|Three days after I ordered the coil packs it was sitting here in a big box that felt empty.<br />I opened the box and it was every well packed to protect the coils.<br />I installed the coils in to the van and had a Frankenstein moment hit the key and &#34;Its Alive&#34;<br />the van ran like new again so I got a great dinner out of the deal Mom was very Happy!<br />I am very happy with my experience!
B00DC4L8CK|4|Perfect for what I need to load. The Item I load has a 15&#34; track and this is nice and WIDE at 17&#34; so nothing falls off !
B004LEXIKK|5|I have had this on my car for a couple of months now and LOVE IT.  My 2010 Mazdaspeed 3, with stock turbo, made 380whp/440ft/lb on a dyno jet uncorrected last week.  If you are looking for a dry nitrous kit, this is the one to get and the place to get it from!
B005VO5RTE|5|Taillight assembly was very easy to install after removing the old broken one.  Came wih the bulbs and seems to be working just great.  I only had to replace it because the original was broken after a tree branch fell on it during a rain storm.  Don't park under trees! Very pleased.  No compliants.
B006CRT72W|5|I ordered this to replace one that was lost.  The price was fantastic extremely reasonable. I'm sure if I had ordered it from Form it would have been 5 times the price. Instructions were simple... It works...
B006EGAIII|1|These ramps do not sit still, i had to put them against a slight concrete lip to get them to stay put as i mounted my car. Upon regress, the ramps tilted up into my front bumper causing the fascia to unclip from the fenders. Poor design for cars.
B00FSEU9YK|5|After doing reasearch I ordered these. Other sites had them more expensive and this was the only site that said they were sold as a pair. Suoer easy to put on and they look great.
B007L0HVUY|4|Nice
B008VQRLUM|5|Put on my 2006 Hyundai Elantra GLS to replace the plastic end links that i cut off. They work great and were a direct bolt on.
B001EAQTRI|5|All the noice inside my car was desapeared. I love it! 10000% recommended! I though it was a irreparable thing. But, fortunately it is not! It was fixed 100%. Thanks
B000IYT158|5|If you drive a foreign car, then this might be the cap for you.  Works nicely for cars that it fits.  Delco is the same one who makes all of those wonderful car parts and car batteries.<br /><br />I like to stick with companies that I know.
B003SRRFY6|4|they are soft, very easy to insult and very good material
B00895EX7Y|3|I bought it some months ago and I have used it 6 times. The first 3 days it worked great but the fourth day, I could hear just in the right side and the micro was not working. Also the volume didn't work so I ordered another micro and changed it. Well, it still doesn't work. I don't know what is happening. Could it be that those headset are not compatible with a Cessna 152 and 172?<br /><br />Hace unos meses compré estos auriculares y solo los he usado 6 veces. Las tres primeras veces funcionaron genial pero el cuarto dia el micro no funcionaba y solo podía escuchar por el lado derecho. Me cambiaron el micro y sigue igual. No funcionan. No se cual es el problema pero alguien me ha comentado que podria ser que estos auriculares trabajan con distintos amperimetros a los de las Cessnas. Si alguien lo sabe le agradecería que lo expusiera aqui.
B000KPSA0W|5|no joke...no problem starting a 1 month dead V10
B000BQSIWK|1|would not charge a 12v battery or switch to 12v
B008V3WMK4|1|I thought I'd try to save a little money and buy this battery instead of a OEM Harley Davidson battery for my 2006 Ultra Classic. Well, to start with, it was poorly packaged and when it showed up it was sliding around in the box which I thought was odd. Then, when I opened the box the positve terminal was damaged as though it had been dropped on that corner. After muttering to myself for a while in disappointment, I thought I'd try to straighten the terminal out and see if I could still use it. It took a while but I got it to where I could get it hooked up so I thought I was good to go. Got her all buttoned up, turned the key and nothing...completely dead! This battery is supposed to be factory charged and ready to go right out of the box. I put my charger on it all day and when I came home from work that evening, still dead. The thing wouldn't even take a charge. This Power Source battery is a complete bust but there is a silver lining to this story.<br />I got a hold of an Amazon customer service rep via a chat and he refunded my entire purchase price for the battery. That's the way business should be conducted. Thank you Amazon for great customer service. As a long time Amazon customer, I really appreciate it. Jeff
B004BL86WS|1|Broke on the first attempt to use, just doesn't appear to be strong enough to handle anything heavy duty.<br /><br />Spring for a differential bearing puller instead, you'll be glad you did!
B00EEA46I4|5|I have had this set up on my 2001 gsxr 1000 for about a month now and I really deal the difference.  Going 16 teeth on the front sprocket really helped my low end torque.
B000RZCJ4I|1|Was told it would fit my truck and didnt
B000IZGIA8|5|The product is one of the best items currently on the market for mobile stability; for example, providing a robust and stable surface on which to slice bananas while on the move! Situated, as it is, near an opening window, disposing of remains such as banana skins and finger tips is also a breeze. Very ergonomic and well thought out design.
B003E3OHAY|5|Looks good, easy to install.
B00DYVTAGW|5|My wife loves them
B005R91NXW|4|Could have better install instructions
B000NDLALM|5|These lights are the closest replacement lights for my RV(2000 National RV Tradewinds).thanks for carrying these lights!!!! Do the Grote company make the the older light body that my RV has??? Thanks
B00370D7D2|5|Great product, absolutely identical to one it replaced.  No problems on install as it is very simple.
B003WTRJOQ|5|I have these tires on my new 2011 Harley Davidson XL 1200C motorcycle.  I really like the looks of these new 'skins'.  The Harley Davidson imprints on them create that 'really cool' look.  But the great thing about them is what they do to make your bike stick to the road on those tight curves. Nice..!! I would like say they are quiet running but I can't hear anything above the wind noise or exhaust noise anyway. Would highly recommend these as a replacement tire for any Harley Davidson that you may ride. I would definately order them (Front & Back) as 'the' tires when that time comes around for my bike.
B001G6MO7Y|5|Perfect fit and price !!!<br />Japanese craftsmanship !!!
B0073G1QS4|5|Nice kit, so far so good
B00OZBQL5I|4|Great Jacket.
B000W5SPQ4|4|This will fit the front tire of most motorcycles. but definitely not the rear tire. it states it fits 60 width tires, but it does not, surely.<br /><br />That said, the build quality is good, and does definitely give you peace of mind that it secures your motorcycle when you are fast asleep. Its got some rubbery coating at the front end of the claw ( the one that is black in color) and that really helps keeping your wheel rims scratchless.<br /><br />Its got to do more as a visual deterrent than anything else to eb frank, have not tried it, but does feel that a heftly man can definitely pull it apart.<br /><br />Id recommend a buy. better than the disc lock brakes honestly.
B000ARPVOI|2|I started using this additive in the summer and thought the engine ran better, but had no increase in gas mileage. As we came into fall, my mileage dropped off more than normal. Then in mid winter and -15 degrees, I tried to add some with my morning fill-up and it had gelled in the bottle. I have added several treatments of techron  and my mileage is starting to improve.
B00DRA4470|4|Really cool better quality than i expected, on time, thank you!<br />SR
B00ARJQ3CS|4|Installed and works perfectly.
B001DDI3E8|5|This is very helpful and provides safety when traveling. I will probably get a second one for the other side.
B004WE9I3K|5|This cleaner works like a miracle.  The leather sectional we have was never sat in as it was located in the living room.  We moved it to the den and used the product on it as it looked dry.  It looks brand new.  We will continue to use it .
B00N5BAWYK|5|Very bright white great for fog lights.
B004L0ABNG|5|Worked great!
B00C80HL98|5|The product itself was great. The trouble I had to go through to get my order filled was horrible.
B0009TO4G8|5|The best transom saver ever made.
B001RBCU90|3|Did not look like picture
B00MRLSE94|5|excellent !
B000VLHAYM|5|The Instatrunk is amazing quick to install and should be a standard feature on all Jeeps !!!! The ordering & shipping were easy & fast. It was a pleasure dealing with amazon...
B002F9CYQM|5|WORTH EVERY PENNY! I bought a knock off brand and they did not work nearly as well or looked nearly as good. Here you pay for what you get and with the expensive price tag you get top quality.  The gold leaves peeled right off the backing and adhered to the fondant covered cake with no problem. It took less then 10 minutes to cover my 6 inch layer cake.  Professional results is what you get with these 23 karat gold leaves. The breathtaking exquisite bright gold leaves gives your cake all the oohs and ahhs and makes you like a professional cake decorator. Don't be cheap and buy less expensive gold leafs. You'll only regret it. I just can't say enough good things about this product.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I knock it out the park and rate it a TWENTY!
B000EDOTCS|3|Better than nothing
B0074K7VM4|5|Improves the look of an already perfect car.
B000CPCRE0|5|Works great on my metal vent covers for my heater.  Paint seems high quality.  Sprays nice and even.  Would buy again.
B0013K6Z0K|4|Works well with gun boots but way overpriced.
B00IX5MM9G|2|Must return for 2 reasons  - a) one unit has bad Red Safety LEDs, blinking intermittently - and b) the Shield Shape Logo is great but it reduces the quality too much.  I hope seller emails me so I can acquire a round Porsche Logo.  If the seller can help me with the 2 simple issues - I will immediately purchase another set and give this product 5 stars - they are 'almost great'!
B00F9LPL5E|5|Very lightweight, surprisingly powerful.  I bought to run an inverter and power my cpap for sleep apnea on camping trips.  Will see how long it lasts, hopefully overnight.
B003PIPG8K|4|Looks OEM once installed.  Little quirky on how it mounts but does the job. Once bolted in seems and is solid enough would like to have seen a few more mounting bolts and not using the tow eyes on the frame but it did mount and look good after install..
B00387LVW8|5|Very good kit, everything fit perfectly.
B003V0GG18|5|Love this smaller then I thought but well made
B000ALIT2K|5|works great
B0017T3P3C|5|Just got this jack. I had a Harbor Freight 48\\" Farm Jack and had lifted the rear of my Taco via the Class III receiver. I just wanted to see how the jack performed with/out the tires off the ground. In a nut shell, the jack scared me! It did not come down without the handle mechanism jamming. Scary @*#&?r!! Took it back and bought the beast! Well worth the extra dough and a solid product! Weighs 32lbs exactly. I weighed it on my scale. This is by far a superior product. Make sure you oil the mechanisms. I sanded the rail closest to the jack handle and sprayed graphite so it jacks smoothly and prevents rust. \\"Cool jack, very cool.\\" As a side note, the packaging was perfect and solid, hence why its total weight is 50lbs and the jacks weight is 32lbs. Very happy and feel 5 stars are appropriate, it does what it should!!
B00TEP5E62|2|We are unable to use any of these cup holder devices in our car. Just won't fit anywhere. Just an ordinary used Cadillac sedan ,not sure what's wrong. Should send them back,just haven't yet.
B004C3TOEO|5|Got installed yesterday, and had lot of head turning onad lot of good feedback, love it.
B002JH7PEQ|4|Only drawback is it has a fan that makes some noise when turned on. I don't mind at all, but may be an issue for some. Be aware it's also a little tall, though should have no trouble fitting in any cupholder. Works great.
B0010HI40K|4|Perfect fit, fast delivery.
B001JSXAYU|4|I love the finish.  It avoids scratches, etc. by being a kind of rubber coating, or some kind of scratch resistant finish.  Anyway, it's wearing well.  I also love the appearance and the overall design.  It's a cool helmet.<br /><br />However, the venting system is not that great and the front vent, has a cheap, molded plastic hinge that broke, very easily, in gentle, normal use.  I just JB welded it shut, because it would no longer operate correctly as the little tabs were broken.  They are like the tabs found on plastic toys that snap together and just wear out.<br /><br />The vents don't work as well as other helmets that I've had, but all in all, this is a good helmet.  I will use it until in wears out, but I will probably go with another HJC again, after this one.
B00540TO2Q|5|a great addition to the trunk
B0009OMYC4|3|Not the best
B00B5AU50E|3|Its lens are starting to peal off not sure whats going on with them. But not happy at all only had thes about a year
B00BUROANA|5|Not hard to change out.  Worked great.
B002YLWUII|5|Amazing Product, no more hard work,No more spots. just what I was looking for. Makes life easier and saves time and visiting car wash.
B001RBQF4G|5|Fits perfectly
B004GCKSY6|5|I needed covers to cover the torn seats on a Honda Civic 1997. They did what I needed them to, they are a little loose but still look great. I would purchase them again if I had to.
B000C59WFW|5|I replaced the OE outer tie rods on my 2005 Chevy Malibu at about 112,000 miles. I chose the Moog replacement outer tie rod and believe this was a good choice.  The OE outer tie rod was a hybrid design using aluminum and steel, where as the Moog outer tie rod was made from all forged steel components with a grease fitting. The stock tie rods did not a have grease fittings which I believe is not a very robust design because it does not allow serviceability as the vehicle ages.  Very easy to install with limited car knowledge needed. I would recommend this part as a replacement.<br /><br />This is my second set of Moog tie rod ends I have purchased for different vehicles and have been very satisfied with the product each time.
B001B58ZM8|5|It was a perfect fit ;-)
B00877SL2M|4|working fine
B003NH7MQC|5|Strong arm rear trunk lift supports , install time 20 minutes or  less , hope they last  longer than the last one s 10 years
B000MK5LVG|2|The box is built well, but this box was supposed to be 13.6 inches wide ... got a 12&#34; X 12&#34; box.  Not enough time to return for the correct size or play games with returns.  If Amazon can't supply the item as described, and paid for, they should be run out of business.  Very unhappy!
B001H1I7Z6|1|Should have bought black water.Not even a close match.Where is the Tuxedo Black Metallic in that paint.Truck cost a lot of money.Now I have a blob of black goo,and a stubby antenna that sucks.
B000EANNDM|3|I don't think this is a good product to use in a solvent tank.  It foams up inside the pump and loses pressure.  Also, when stored with the lid closed it condensates inside the lid and is corroding all unpainted hardware.  I used it as a 1:4 mix with water; works fine on automotive grease but have to use a brass wire brush to actually clean.  I had real solvent before and am planning to revert back.  Organic and environmentally friendly is great and all, just doesn't do what I want it to.  In addition, may not be a good idea to use on engine internal componants...seems like mine have gummed up after drying.
B00063V40G|3|Just not what I expected I've had bete  ghost is one just seems off
B000CITK8S|5|The correct product was shipped and arrived on time. This product maintains a variety of smaller batteries while equipment is not in use.
B00BXLRDD2|4|HAS 2 STONES BUT 1 HAS ALREADY FELL OUT A LITTLE OVER PRICED
B00ABYVT64|1|The pumps didn't make it through 2 fillings , very dissatisfied
B000O1C47M|5|Excellent vacuum pump. Quiet  and powerful. I've only got it connected to my refrigerant gauges but it always pulls down to 30 (I know.. not calibrated etc...).<br />Just keep the oil level up and it should last a long time.
B001FCJTNG|5|I bought this through amazon all other places were quoting a lot more for the same product. The quality is more of light duty not heavy duty. I have a nice truck not a rugged truck. The only thing I have noticed is a slight 1/4 protrusion on the left side of the skid plate compared to the right side. Its hardely noticeable and aparantely Im the only one that has noticed. LOTS of compliments especially when I tell them the cost. By the way its polished stainless steel not chrome, so there is a slight difference in the shine but no complaints.
B00AR379U4|5|5 star
B003WJDHSS|5|I received this key but, was never able to use it since I bought it for my son to play with.  My son likes car keys and like to play with them and, since I bought him a FORD remote I wanted him to have some similar to what we have (we own an Expedition).  The key was exactly like the very expensive FORD keys that the dealer sells.  I am happy with my purchase.
B002VPLB6O|5|Had oil change people throw this part in since its behind filter and not easy to reach, labor extra 25$ solved oil pressure light from coming on. Try this before you suspect oil pump. 07 chevy impala, oil pressure light came on when accelerating over 60mph, and sort of erratic some times on and some times off.
B00G27LHYS|5|What else can I say? Straight and to the point
B003Y3ZHKS|1|I bought this from another retailer about 6 months ago.  I used it twice and now it no longer works.  Save yourself a headache and buy a different product from a name brand company.
B000JZSPBM|5|Easy to install, works great.  couldn't ask for anything better.  I never knew just how bad the old ones were till I installed these
B0033YJPNI|5|Fit my 2005 F150 supercrew perfectly.  Came with a polarity changing cable required for the 04 and early 05 models.  The documentation was clear.  Hardest part of the installation was removing the door panel; you have to pull out the 2 lower plastic fastener that are used to hold the screws for the speaker before I could lift off the door panel.
B000B8N3MI|5|So happy to get a replacement so quickly after losing mine and at a good price!
B001NYYREC|5|Perfect compliment to Pollak 11-998 4' Pigtail  when installing my receiver on a 2002 Silverado.
B0009H52AC|5|Bought this for my old escort (1993), it fit perfectly and does the job.
B003B6P5R8|4|It was good as it was described
B000HEBR3I|5|very handy tool to have in the workshop. One used for petrol, the other to take water out of our kayak after using it.
B00068OOG2|5|This product has great instructions, easy to follow wiring diagrams, and plenty of wire for the install.  I installed it on my 70 Charger that has an electric fan setup and now I dont have to remember to turn the fan on. Great product for the money, and peace of mind.  Only recomendation is that you solder all connections and heat shrink connections to prevent corrosion. The supplied connectors will work fine but you may want to at least electrical tape them after securly crimping them on if you can not solder.
B000JUXGHK|5|Amazing craftsmanship and quality , Excellent design and appearance Very precision. Better quality  than competitors units at  twice the price. Don't overlook Pertronix in your search for a good distributor
B001HKZHIW|5|This has been one of the best investments we have made for our camper. It is easy to dump the tank even when the sewer dump is a distance away.
B009S9RURU|5|Nice sticker. My husband liked it a lot. So I ordered. Very satisfied with quality. Easy to stick it to the car.
B004QB7HLY|5|Good heavy duty product, great customer service! Mine arrived in a timely manner but the bolts were missing!? I called the company that shipped the product and they promptly sent me another bracket with bolts!<br />Anything can be broken into, but it would take a very persentent person to cut this, bolt cutters would be useless. It's large enough for a large chain. The bolts even come with a ball bearing to hammer into the hex head screws after tightening to prevent removing the screws. With a crow bar long and heavy enough I you might could pry this out of the concrete, but it would be work. Highly recommend.
B000JFJLTC|5|Wife was so excited when I brought this home!!!  Night life will never be the same!!!
B001FCAXZO|5|This is an excellent product and will save me a lot of time when filling my RV batteries that are located under the step. An very good company to do business with.
B004QM98HE|2|Had to send it back because It just didn't fit right. The seller was AAAAA+, understood my problem and made returning it painless.
B00KKL0I7E|1|do not waste your money on this product, very bad light, malfunctions, do not change the original bulbs for this article, is a bad option.
B00AMLQ5GA|3|Got these so my girl friend could get into the truck without giving me the evil eye every time, at her height I guess it was a chore.<br /><br />One of the reviewers gave it very low marks for the installation directions, I have to agree. I'm pretty handy and it was still a guessing game.  The directions were OK, but there were 2 major problems.<br /><br />First there are 3 brackets per side, so 6 brackets, all different and only 1 was marked as to where it went, without that mark it would have been a real pain to get them in the right place, and even with the marked one it became a guessing/measuring game. The front brackets were identifiable as to how they went by the picture in the directions, then the passenger center was marked, but then you had to install the rear and then measure from one bar mounting hole to the next hole to see if it was the right bracket on the right side in the right orientation.  This took about an hour for the first side and about 15 minutes for the second side as I had something for reference.  If each bracket had been marked as I thing they were supposed to be it would be an easy straightforward install, except for the second problem.<br /><br />Now the real pisser, once the passenger side brackets were all hung I was on my back holding the bar in place and went to start one of the bolts to hold it in place................the bolts supplied were the WRONG size.  The bolts called for in the directions were M8s, (8mm) the bolts supplied were M8s, but the threaded inserts in the bar itself were M10, (10mm).  Luckily it's not that far to the hardware store and they had what I needed but needless to say I was pissed by the time I finished the install.<br /><br />So yes they look great, the finish on them is great too.  One note the stainless steel is pretty soft, at first I laid the bar on the concrete as I was getting ready to put it in place and just moving it slightly left some pretty good scratches, they're on the bottom so no problem but I finished the job by using the box as a cushion anytime I needed to lay the bars on the ground.but I finished the job by using the box as a cushion anytime I needed to lay the bars on the ground.
B005X9WSLW|5|original formula was the best glad to still find it.
B0097LJXRO|5|First of all, I love the slogan on the license plate holder- obviously!! Now about the product itself. The quality of this product is absolutely exceptional and my MD license plate fits perfectly. The construction and build quality is very good and it is very sturdy.The holes for the screws are also in the correct position and I didn't have any problems or issues putting it on my car.<br />As far as the purchase and delivery of the product, what can I say, an exceptional job by Amazon as usual. They (I ordered 2- the other one in silver/chrome with black writing) arrived before the estimated delivery date which is always great- thanks Amazon!!
B00G49NYKY|5|Leaves tires very shinny even after rain....
B00152ZTJO|5|FIT MY TOYOTA 1997 4RUNNER
B004GE1MUI|1|Horrible
B001LRJHFK|3|The plastic piece is too long for my lady hands, it is uncomfortable. Otherwise it installs easily and is sturdy.
B0009ETC6U|5|Great chain for the money.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Heavy duty<br />Lock is well built and operates well.<br />Nice cover over chain to protect paint<br /><br />Cons:<br />Keys for the lock feel cheap and look crappy, (they do work fine)<br /><br />Other notes:<br />It's very heavy.  This is not a Con, probably more of a Pro, but it should be considered.  I carry it in my tank bag on my motorcycle and it's noticeable.<br /><br />Overall great value for the money.  I'd buy it again if I find the need for another chain.
B000CGFUFW|5|This pump went in my 1994, 4.3 S10 Blazer. I replaced the old pump as a preemptive strike to avoid a failure on the road. Pulling the tank is pretty simple as long as the tank is empty or almost empty. Delphi is a OEM manufactuer for GM and while there were less expensive pumps available, it wasn't worth it me to scrimp on this purchase. Pump fit like it should but you do need to buy the strainer for the Delphi pump and the OEM Delco strainer will not fit right on the Dephi pump. Price was less than half of what local parts stores wanted for the identical part.
B0049DVR1U|5|Great to have.
B000HDEZBU|5|adding this to your R* will make a big difference. using the K&N stock replacement is ok too but going with this kit you will really notice a big change.  if you have after market pipes on this is a must, but remeber that when you get into that can or worms you will need a jet kit too.
B0081O5XFO|5|Loved the product, unfortunately truck was replaced with new 2014 Dodge Ram shortly after install. Please alert me if possible when the compatible model becomes available, as I would like to purchase for this truck.
B000QIS59Y|5|Perfect fit for my 02 corvette
B008SEBQ2G|4|Looks great and only affects station strength if it's already weak in your area.
B005N53C9I|4|looked great
B002VY4IWE|5|Loved it this was easy to apply. Looks great
B00IKLL9QA|5|Works perfectly! I love that it has a dual nozzle and was bigger then I was expecting it to be. I have no complaints about how it works though I did notice that it leaks a bit. I had to use some Teflon tape to cut out leaks. (Might have been my hoses) Otherwise I have been super happy with my purchase.
B00M06AIJU|5|A little pricy, but worth the $.  Nice fit and finish.  Sturdy, versatile and looks OEM.
B001EESTH2|5|While the instructions are useless, the job is pretty self-explanatory.  Kit included plenty of lube for assembly and the product fit perfectly and looks great.  Strongly recommend.
B004KK553I|3|these r great for the price ive spent way more for others problem not good in car wash the stones fall off............
B004RIUZ4M|4|Looks great didn't last me more than a year started peeling
B007CJ3054|2|I bought 4 of these for my 2 new Hyundai elantras and within 2 months they started to pit and corrode.  Granted it was winter in New England but I would have expected them to last longer. I even waxed them prior to installing them. Would only recommend for places that dont see salt or chemicals for roads.
B005CV0156|5|Look and fit great.
B00DBESPEK|5|I depend on reviews so , these light are great BRIGHT AN ALSO GOES WELL WITH MY 99 accord coupe!<br />U will be happy!
B000GKSNGC|3|Really liked this at first. Easy to use, quality seem pretty good. Don't know if its the temperature in the garage this summer but recently a lot of grease has leaked out of the bottom where the suction handle is.
B006FDD74W|1|These key shells are advertised by the seller under different seller IDs and are fakes.  The shells do not have a compartment for the electronic chip inside your stock Honda key to snap in.  Without the compartment for you to snap in your electronic chip, your car won't start.  They advertise it works with many models, but BEWARE.  THESE ARE FAKES AND IF YOU CAN'T SNAP IN YOUR CHIP TO THIS FAKE KEY SHELL, YOU'RE CAR WON'T START!
B0085OMN30|5|I needed a new key chain for my car key; I never get anything this fancy but I do like it.  The crystals look nice, of good quality and they do not look cheap.  The key-chain is a bit heavy, I don't mind.  It is exactly as pictured.  I think the price is reasonable.
B007A7X6IE|5|This was an affordable tool for someone who likes to work on their vehicle.  He loved it and no longer has to borrow his Dad's!
B00HC16AP4|2|This key-chain arrived quickly, properly packaged. It was less robust than what I expected. Other such products I had in the past had thicker leather and more massive fob.<br /><br />It does look nice, the logo is properly represented however, in less than a month's time, the &#34;mph&#34; of &#34;Triumph&#34; is losing the chrome showing the copper metal underneath. This key ring only has my motorcycle key on it and is clipped to the key holder inside my riding jacket. It has never been in my pocket with other items that could possibly wear off the &#34;mph&#34; letters.<br /><br />That's too bad as I really liked the look of this item. I have no complaints with the vendor as mentioned above, it came early, properly packaged. It's just too bad that I have a cruddy looking key ring that cost $10. Oh well.
B00383GZBO|3|I putchased this as a replacement for the two other ones that i broke. in my defense i work construction and those two lasted me 4+ years.  The range on this seems compatible with the factory remotes and living in the city i cant always get a parking spot on my block or the next. I give it 3 stars because after a few weeks the button for the remote start stopped working right.  Since its winter time i use the remote start every day.  I dropped my keys with the remote attached the other day and the button started working again but im still having problems using the remote start button for when i make a quick stop and dont want to turn off my truck.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars because the price was great and shipping was quick. Everything works and was easy to configure but if it stops working whenever it feels like and i have to drop it to fix it, eventually the screen will break and i would buy another one to replace this one.
B00IOACP6U|5|Good
B000CEFWO8|5|it does what I need at a fair price.  It's easy to apply and take off, easy to store, and appears heavily made with simple parts that are uncomplicated.
B00144AGVO|4|good replacement product, cheaper than other places. directions are good enough. bought two because i screwed the first one up. would probably buy again.
B00EHIPNLC|4|Easy to install although the instructions seemed much more ominous than reality. Plug & Play with no problems yet.
B000NDBMEC|4|nice product
B004A6I1UG|5|Installed easily, fits good. No leaks. Mom wrecked vehicle after about 1 month of being installed so can't speak on it's durability.
B007I6K3YW|5|Quality product speedy delivery
B000W0KTMW|3|Bought for my T100 Triumph. The pin is slightly larger that the holes in my front disc so I can only use it on my rear disc.
B0038882C4|5|Looks great on the Chevy, feels tight, feels right.  Nice packaging, made in the USA. Solid choice.  Will be doing more business with Prothane.
B007ZDNOP8|5|dresses up the interior...an eye catcher...the stock knob is sooo boring.
B00GKNO6GU|3|Touches mid pipe with aftermarket power bomb
B006B3C3XC|5|Quick and easy install.  Very bright, fits just right!
B001Q6IZMM|5|Nice original Product!!!!!!
B0087PHVOI|5|Great product!!!
B00AFPVZ2C|5|I love the new look I received so many compliments it makes the car stand out more I recommend great product
B00I4LGWVS|5|It's the right part he needed.
B007JRQI6W|1|just not that good. It didn't last more than a week
B00CDAFT6K|4|I was surprised at how big they were because I remember reading that they were only 6inX7in, they are more like 10inX14in. But since it has just one suction cup, it'll stay. I've had it in my car (Toyota matrix) for a few days now and they've stayed. So I'm happy with them for now.
B004I0QKDO|3|The rubber gasket around the light was coming off, and one of the tabs that locks the assembly to the vehicle was broken when I received it.  Amazon is issuing replacement.  Hopefully the new one is much better quality.  Replacement issued quickly by Amazon.  New light is better quality but not a perfect fit.
B000WEKQ3K|5|This is my second set of floor liners. They fit perfect in my Lincoln and in my Chevy truck. Thanks for a great product.
B000E3GHGE|5|Great Product Fast  Shipping!
B000HJBF3K|5|Great product & quick shipping!
B0084UKD1Y|5|Product was exactly as described. Quick shipping
B001MU5JOE|5|awesome as expected
B000CNJGYG|4|That is why I got it. The Emgos are cheaper but don't come with the O ring.
B0023V7F84|5|Really great tail light
B00GG5KQWA|3|The front and back emblems fade quick and the material warp easily when exposed to sun all day
B000OCT7FI|5|Very happy with purchase .Thank you
B000FPX5M0|5|I have always bought K&N Performance Kits for my cars not only for the small performance gains but the easy of cleaning them.  I also like the sound of a roaring V8 engine with a K&N installed. All in all the performance increase versus cost isn't the best, better off buying nitro.  A K&N Performance kit is the beginning of better things to come.
B0013FW1OY|5|Took a little time to cut hook up wires I did like that it came with wire connectors that crimped and once heated became water proof thank you
B001O7PNS2|5|Easy to apply and protects well
B002OR4242|5|I have a 2000 26' Nomad from Skyline. It came equipped with a Magnetek model 6345 Converter/Charger. I purchased this product to: (1) Upgrade the original system from a single stage charger to a \\"smart\\" multi stage charger. Previous owner told me he had constant overcharging problems. This should do the trick. (2) I also decided to go with this 55 amp model to replace the old 45. It was a gamble since Progressive Dynamics says the 45 amp model is the correct replacement. This turned out to be the right move for me. The new DC circuit board has an extra bus on it. I intend on wiring a true sine wave inverter directly to it to supply power to my new LED TV & DirecTV HD DVR which only pulls about 250w 2amps 110v AC. I also replaced the two cheap 12v Deep Cycle Batteries with two Trojan T-105 6v Batteries wired in Series. Judging from the ease of installation, smart charging system, and price. I would have to say this product deserves 5 stars. I believe this is a new product so it may be hard to find reviews from people who have been using this product but It is more or less a combination of PD's other Converter/Charger combined with their \\"Charge Wizard\\" all packaged into a case that is the same exact size as the Magnetek 6300 series. Unless you are charging a multi bank system. I would buy this one again.
B0043WOEGC|5|Very Good product, quick service!
B00G2586NK|5|Very happy I got this - feel so much better about watering the vegetable garden with this on the hose.
B000LG5BPM|5|really like Gibson exhaust products...had catback system on chev astro..amazing difference...put this muffler on my 2013 chev express as there is no catback system available....seat of the pants results....more power and quicker acceleration...a lot less exhaust braking ....catalytic exhaust temperatures have gone down 100-150 degree...exhaust runs cooler....sounds more authoritative also!!!  no mpg difference but there is a power difference....i highly recommend Gibson...
B002E2WMWG|3|So far so good. I hope it last.
B0055AZ898|1|Garbage, Cheap rotors, I can't believe DELCO put their name on this junk
B0012GTVVA|5|This is great! Will keep screen protected and can close screen easier. My cousin had one on her RV and they liked it also!
B000C5HHBI|1|ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO AMAZON SAID THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED FOR MY 2001 MERCURY GRAND MARQUIS AND NOW THEY SAY THAT THIS WILL NOT FIT MY CAR.<br />SO I ORDERED IT ANYWAY AND FIND OUT THAT THE IDLE IS WAY TO FAST.<br />SO I GOT ONE FROM ADVANCE AUTO PARTS BWD BRAND AND IT WORKS GOOD.<br />I WENT ON OTHER SITES AND THE MOTORCRAFT CX1866 IS THE CORRECT ONE.<br />I MUST HAVE GOT A DEFECTIVE ONE - I WANTED TO SEND IT BACK TO AMAZON TO GET A REPLACEMENT BUT THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS TO OLD TO SEND BACK.<br />I DO NOT THINK THAT  WAS  RIGHT.
B0030HUFC8|3|While the installation was straight forward, I noticed within 1/2 hour of use that the lens had moisture behind it.  I can only assume that over time, the meter function will corrode over time and fail.  I haven't had time to verify the calibration so I can not report on the gauges accruracy.
B00RZT2R0A|5|As an extra Father's Day gift, my wife backed the 2007 Saturn Vue out of the garage while answering the phone.  In doing so, she spider-webbed the mirror glass, though the rest of the passenger side mirror assembly was intact.  I was not happy, because I know the dealer or my local mechanic would easily charge me probably $150 to replace the glass.  So being a handy guy myself, I decided to see if I could do it for cheaper with parts on Amazon... I didn't expect over 10x savings though!  The job was so easy it was almost like a joke. 1.  Took a brown shopping bag with gloves and a few basic tools and scraped out the broken glass. 2.  Vacuumed dust and glass particles. 3.  Dry fit the glass to make sure it fit right- Perfectly... like a glove! 4.  Remove glass, and use rubbing alcohol on a paper towel to clean the plastic surface. 5.  Cleaned fingerprints off the backside of the mirror. 6.  Placed 4 adhesive stickers and pushed them down firmly in place. 7.  Pealed off the backing of the double-sided adhesives. 8.  Snapped the glass into place, and pressed firmly to adhere. 9.  Done!  for &#60; $20!!!  It was so easy (and fun) that I almost can't wait to break another mirror so I can try it again!  LOL.  Thank you AutoTruckMirrorsUnlimited!
B0082JW19E|5|Perfect Fit, thank you !
B0080IFG5S|4|After figuring out how it works, it worked well. It's for emergency fixes, I wouldn't ride too long on a plugged tire.
B005VPS358|5|Worked great for my Jeep
B0095TESIM|5|Perfect fit. Looks great. thanks
B004LZVPT0|5|Install instructions were AWFUL. Go on their website to download/print the instructions in color. Other than that, install took 2 hours with 2 men
B00496RDVA|5|Fuel oump went out on my 99 Contour.  Contrary to popular belief you do nor have to drop the fuel tank to replace the pump, did everything from inside the car.  Anyways.  Package arrived via prime shipping early in the day.  The pump looked and felt better than the one I removed.  Installed and fired up, I get 38 psi at the fuel rail.  Works like a charm.  Would definitely recommend this over the 50$+ pumps offered at my local parts stores
B003WDEYPE|4|i wanted this for my motorcycle. i have not had the opportunity to use it yet but i feel at some point i will
B000N3W8J0|5|I like this product because it doesn't let your sponge or brush go to the bottom of the bucket and get all the dirt that settles. Also its design doesn't let the water get stirred up. i shot the hose in the bucket and it didn't ripple to the top!! very cool feature. Impressed
B00230IDI6|5|great product, fast shipping, great price, great seller
B003C1D0L0|1|Does not fit the hjc sp-cl like it says it does.
B000EVWDU0|3|A fair priced electrical accessory functioning as advertised. I did not like how it as a unit must plug in two the 12 volt vehicular accessory ought let. Protruding as it did it became something two bump and break however that was do two the location in my vehicle as well driving habits. Instead a corded leader would make it in my eye a better product removing the specter of damage at a inconvenient moment.
B003EPLCBO|1|Should be no star at all for this product! because its very weak light and color not good , my original bulb 70% stronger light and more Concentration in the road than this,<br />my advice, don't waste your money on this one , go search for better product!
B009EA9PPI|5|Perfect fit/function, high quality and price! Can't ask for much more than that!
B000GZPH1G|5|Bien
B000C5YD1A|4|&#34;worked great for me, excellent shipping and hasle-free returns&#34; it's worth a buy.
B007KCZG6E|5|Worked pefectly.  Somehow I need 18 words to get this published. Now it is nine more works to get this published
B002P8DFPW|5|This the best product I have ever purchased from Amazon. All the other auto parts stores wanted $75.00-80.00 for this item. It was a perfect fit and very easy to install. It looks just like the side mirror that was installed by Jeep the right color, right size. I would highly recommend this product for those who are shopping for a side mirror.
B00BR2CMYC|5|My one year old Fantastic Vent dome was crap. Made of a highly flexible rubbery material that would actually lift up on one side with a cross wind. It was a bottom of the line vent. I needed a high quality rigid dome and this was it. Went on quickly and was a perfect fit. A word about instillation-my vent has a vent lock latch. Before attaching the new dome, align and latch the vent-then screw in the hinge screws. That was the latch will work perfectly.
B001B5DZUA|5|Worked great for a 04 Lancer ES replacement. Pressure is on-par with the original factory plate and the grab is excellent. Didn't seem to add any noise to the car like when I had clutch system replaced in my Z.
B008P8FC4I|5|Put it in my motor home on a 2500 mile trip never missed, very helpful. Only thing, if you enter a city and know how to get out the other end, it keeps wanting to take you back out to the highway the way you came, until it gets the idea it needs to think it over, then comes up with a new route out in front of you. I entered all our destinations ahead of time and just selected them when needed. If you are to far out from your destination, I found it was better to add a halfway point, then select the original detestation at that there. Many, many options!
B00CQNFV12|4|Solid product
B00H1ES6S6|5|Super bright. Looks nice
B0088LMVMI|2|The key came fast and is what I ordered. The reviews said they got the key cut and it worked fine. Well, I got the key cut and transferred the chip part.  The key opens the car doors but will not start the car. Does the original key have something in it to make it work in the ignition that this new shell doesn't? The plastic was cracked on my original key to where the key part was coming out of the shell.
B000VU8YO8|5|Perfect love it
B005HAYDR4|5|Very nice for the $$$$$$$
B007TG7I0I|1|Doesn't work well on my Ford Focus. Sometimes making huge noise. Will not buy this again.
B003WKO2WC|3|If your not mechanically inclined, avoid this one. Most pieces dont line up well, and I had to drill out several holes to make it work. The gate does not close properly, and the retaining pins dont work right at all. It has started to rust in several spots, I would suggest painting it prior to installation.
B004HX4W1E|5|If any one has a RZR 170 this is a must have!  We live in Florida and this is the first extra we purchased and it has paid for itself 10x over.  Definately reccomend to others
B000I1ZMCW|3|I recently purchased a 3/8\\" and a 1/2\\" CDI electronic torque wrench at the same time thinking that they were snap-on quality and they would be great wrenches.  They both arrived with the same problem.  The ratchets were both jammed as shipped.  I managed to work the 1/2\\" ratchet loose and it switched and racheted after that.  I did the same thing with the 3/8\\" wrench but it kept jamming every time I torqued something.  I returned the 3/8\\" wrench and received another.  The replacement wrench did the exact same thing.<br /><br />After reading that another buyer had the same experience that was caused by a lack of proper lubrication in the rachet internal parts, I disassembled and greased the jammed 3/8\\" wrench.  It now works perfectly.  I did the same with the 1/2\\" wrench and it also works much better now.<br /><br />I love how the electronic part of the wrench works and it's really ironic that the rachet on a snap-on wrench is the weak link (at least in the condition that it is shipped).  I would give this product a 1 or 2 but I'm sure it's going to work really well for years to come now that I helped it along.  However, it doesn't deserve a 5 if I have to finish the assembly with grease that they should be using in the first place.  If you read this and decide to buy and grease one for yourself, you will need small torx drivers to remove the screws.<br /><br />As the title states - great wrench but it needs some work to make it perform properly.
B000IYBJ9E|5|Shipment was speedy. My wiper blades arrived sooner than I expected.. AWESOME! And now I can see in the rain!! I highly recommend Bosch Wiper Blades over any other brand!!!
B000EDUUIA|5|Got two of these -- one for my car and one for the hub's car so we could park with our back bumpers as close to the garage door as possible.  We followed the instructions to park the cars put the doohickey under the tire, mark it, back up, stick the doohickey on the floor, and voila... perfect parking alignment.  We now have room to put our two humongous trash cans in front of our cars and still have room to walk to them in front of the cars to get to the cans to put trash in -- without bashing our bumpers w/ the garage door.  I would assume a handy person could probably recreate this product w/ cheaper materials, but we are neither handy nor motivated for that kind of innovation, so this little product worked great.
B004SSAF6E|4|Cover fits, could use more grommet holes for holding it down on the car
B004T1P862|5|OEM-Just as described-would buy again-honest seller and perfect fit!
B0028321V8|5|It is what it says, it does what its supposed to. Shipped fast!
B004VG0N38|3|They did the job, and did it well, but didn't hold up. The microfiber is separating from the backing and the material is seriously matted after only one use. I was careful to use them as indicated and they did the job... just not so great looking after coming out of the washing machine!  Maybe you could buy a disc washers that would be better for them... but who wants to blow that much money when you can find cheaper and probably better discs from other manufacturers?  Meguiars is good stuff... but they could find a better manufacturer for these discs.
B0014M21TQ|1|I oredered some of these bulbs back in January and i had them in for two days before one of them looked wierd. I took them out and one bulb had a bubble in it. The lady named Jenna said thats what happens when oil from your fingers get on the bulb. It couldn't have been me tho because i use gloves to put any headlights i get in. Anyways she told me i could return them for a different pair so i sent them back. now she has my money and my product and told me that when she \\"tried\\" to send the new ones back it came back as unknown address. So i don't understand how the old ones came to me but the new ones some how magically didn't. I will be going to the better BBB about this company and filing a claim with amazon and talking to my parents lawyer about this. my suggestion is don't go with this company because if something goes wrong with the product \\"YOUR SCREWED\\".
B00BHMRTF4|1|When I typed in the shield I needed for my Scorpion helmet this particular one kept coming up so I assumed it would fit.  It did not and I had to return it.
B00967294S|3|these are plastic not aluminum
B002MEJB1Q|5|Easy to use design. Easy to keep open for quick stuffing of trash and easy to empty.<br />Use a disposable plastic grocery bag or produce bag liner to keep inside clean.
B00H9JWLWK|4|Nice fast ship; fragrance is a bit weak...
B00OW831H0|5|Very nice item. Very neatly done!!! I like it.  Thanks
B003L33Q0O|5|good
B000FHEMAC|5|I was a little skeptical at first but after installing and using the Bike Pro chock I really liked it. With using the removable plate and tie downs, it is very easy to keep in my trailer and retain the full use without anything in the way. Two of my friends bought them after I showed them.
B00BMU957G|1|Just crap.  I didn't expect a lot for this price, but dang two of them cracked and fell off the first time we drove.  I would skip these and either spend more money or just leave the wheels bare.  They will be bare anyway
B00455L5WS|5|Don't bother with the cheap plastic shovels that will break the first time you use them. This is a real quality shovel that you can depend on when needed. Telescopic handle collapses to make storage easy. Worth the price!
B004GOAC2W|5|This was what I wanted to go on my motorcycle. It was a perfect fit, where I wanted it to go.
B00U9T5TYE|1|I received this part on time which was fine, BUT after installing this in my 2007 Jeep Wrangler it leaked right off the bat. I have installed many many radiators in my life and never had one that leaked this bad. There is a reason why this radiator is so cheap, because it is cheap.
B009ES3F0Q|5|Very well made lights. They seem extremely durable. They are also very very bright They exceeded my expectations by a lot. I would deffinately recommend this product to anyone.
B000KPQ8X8|3|I watched this clock on YouTube video and was impressed, it sure looked like a work of art.   However upon arrival I found their Chinese outsourcer is evidently cutting corners.   I first found the fancy 2nd in the picture I liked had been replaced by a cheap plain one; after talking to Maples customer service I found out it has been 'revised' :(.   Also I found many of the gears didn't line up with the teeth so they remained idle even though the clock was moving (while all the gears moved in the video).   There were gaps all over the place.   The instruction booklet was a one page blurry Xerox, about four sentences that gave no help.    I emailed Maples about the gears and they never answered, so I can only assume shoddy workmanship.   This was a great idea, and if they had only spent a few extra bucks on quality control I would have been a loyal customer.   If I'm going to pay  [...] for a clock I would have expected something better.   Grade:  C+    -----  1-24-11   Update    I finally talked to Maples and found out that apparently all the gears were never intended to move, some don't.  The person who made the video apparently had customized theirs.   So I am raising my rating a star, although I'm still not quite sure why it was made this way.  The clock certainly looks more interesting with all the gears moving.   Also they finally mailed me one of their old second hands from stock (the one pictured on their boxes), which I think makes the clock- but if you buy one, you won't get it.    Here is the YouTube video clip I originally saw which made me look for the clock for sale:  [COGWHEEL.MOV]
B0031BNG6K|3|This was my 1st Revolution Big Bore kit,  Cylinders look great, Cometic gaskets included.  I had a problem with the pistons as the dome did not match the head recess properly.  I had to do some shaping with a die grinder on the edge of the piston dome. Although I contacted Revolution tech support I never heard back from them.  Not a big deal, just had to spend a little extra time on the install.  I gave it a 3 stars because of the extra work involved and Revolutions tech support.
B0030XG4AE|5|Works and easy to install in my accord.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Exactly what I wanted. Fast delivery.
B00HWQ9NFI|5|Great product.
B000E9TS6O|5|Many people have recommended that I try ONR on my vehicles, I often thought - gee that seems a little expensive for a quart as compared to the Wal*Mart stuff that's like $5/gallon.  Wow was I impressed!  Just 2 capfulls of ONR to 2 gallons of water and I could wash 4 cars!  I had a separate rinse bucket and my son and I washed 4 cars in ~1 hour.  We didn't even have to unroll the hose like we usually do since this is a 'waterless' wash.  Just two buckets and 4 gallons of water.  The ONR formula seems to really pull the dirt off the cars, and the shine is just awesome!  Highly recommended!
B003SZ3GK0|5|Fits my 04 Silverado just fine. Slightly different looking than my stock one, but same dimensions. Nice and quiet. Comes with new screw and spacer. You'll have to use your existing lock washer, so don't ruin that as you take your old one off.
B002KPWN8A|5|I installed these shocks with the Hell Bent Steel 2&#34; leveling kit. Works great.
B00DZ356MG|5|The bike cranked right up after I installed the battery right out of the box. No charging or assembly required. Fit perfectly in the battery box and the cable connections were in the right spot. I would recommend this battery.
B003V9TCW4|5|love it
B007AOS8K8|5|i love these mats. they collect all the grime and junk that would other wise get all over your vehicle. easy to clean and look really good.
B000VDYNKY|4|The cutest mats I've ever seen. I was a little concerned about the white in them at first since I live in a wooded area and there's a lot of dirt getting tracked into my car, but they've stayed surprisingly clean. Only complaint is the front mats fit a little awkwardly.
B004W6ELW6|5|PERFECT FIT ; ORDERED FOR NEIGHBOR AND SHE WAS HAPPY WITH ITEM
B0002JN2EU|3|After dealing with a dead engine coil, I went ahead and ran this through the vac line and fuel tank. I cannot attest to its full efficacy but fuel mileage seemed to increase. However, my exhaust emitted profuse smoke for about 2 hours afterwards.
B001KS6FPK|3|The blades do a great job...streak free, but, they are a bit bulky. When the wind is blowing hard they tend to catch too much wind to the point of nearly ripping the wiper arm off of the mount. Has several clips for most wiper arm styles.  I will look for a beam style with more aerodynamics next purchase.
B004QCCJ2U|5|Easy fix to my transmission problem
B002S9Z9EI|2|Put this PCV on my 2011 Electra Glide FLHTP.  Easy installation with noticeable performance improvement, however after only 300 miles my bike would lose power and shut off at various speeds and temps.  Removed PCV and no issues with bike since.  I contacted Dynojet and they were more than helpful with getting it sent in for testing.  Waiting on results now, hopefully this was just a random bad unit. I have never had issues with Dynojet in the past.
B000FLT9WE|5|I liked these so much I got a second set for my other truck. Kick on the high beams and those lonely Alaska winter highways just melt away.
B00480J4KA|5|Works great and much cheaper than from the Lexus dealer.
B000BQ097C|3|This product is as described,  and seems to do the intended job. I hope it lasts which only time will tell.
B009B7K6WU|5|I purchased this product for my Lexus (SUV), and am very happy with it. I would definitely recommend it to others.
B001H227HY|5|Great price, works.  Got my truck back on the road.
B002UCACSG|5|working great and good customer service
B001T4SK1W|5|Got these yesterday and tried them on.  I have a 32 and a 30 inseam.  Small was a nice fit.    Was able to slip on a pair of slim fit Wranglers and  pair of skinny fit Levis over them with no problem.  FYI the tighter fit jeans help the pads stay where they belong.    Put on the thigh armor too and had no problem.  Only problem I had was when sitting, the hip armor would hit against my belt.    Update 10/14/2013:  Have really gotten used to these pants now and enjoy the added feeling of security knowing that my lower half has some armor protection.  Gonna try them under my snow pants this winter as I will attempt snowboarding and I fully expect a lot of wipeouts.  Gotta protect the ol' tailbone!
B001EYHK9U|5|Very satisfied with strap.
B004UTCM6M|5|I had to be stealthy to get this on the car. Two weeks later she noticed and loved it. Well, she was ok with it. Ok, she admitted that it was true
B00407WNE0|5|Quick easy install. Nice finishing touch/look.
B0089T07P2|5|Worked on my 1998 Jeep Wrangler - Great Item - Fast Shipping - Will Purchase Again
B00FA3Z5J8|5|I changed the way the mirror is mounted using clamps instead of screwing to the roll bar. Good for the price.
B00D329DI2|4|Good quality, not &#34;odorless&#34; as the package states. Still smells very strongly of plastic
B00V93AKNY|5|Stick well and very beautiful in my car! Thanks
B00F7GXNX8|5|Arrived quickly and applied easily (without any bubbles).
B003VQFXVG|5|worked really great, 3-5 minutes tops to install and it wont fall off either. looks beautiful, great complement to vehicle.
B008KSFLOE|5|I had to buy 2 of these for the summer.  Not only they have a great design and looks, but also keep your head fresh, by that I mean you can wear it on a very sunny day, you won't feel your head melting as it has vents and a nice fabric that keeps it at a reasonable temperature.<br /><br />If you're a BMW lover and a heat hater, then this is a cap for you.
B0012CX76Y|3|came with scratches on the plastic parts of the bumper.
B00KN0UOEE|5|Awesome stuff! Leaves a deep black finish that's truly not greasy. It last's a long time too. I used to use Meguiar's but this is simply a superior product. Great on my engine bay too!
B00FBQ2OKM|5|I love live love this rug. I use it outside my horse trailer to help with debris being tracked in trailer. Quality is good. Easy to store with the bag and lightweight enough for me to handle my self. So glad I didn't get a smaller one.
B00KUBKUQ8|5|great stuff, good blue
B000VDYNKY|3|These mats are great and fit very well in my G6. They are pretty much exactly what I expected them to be. However, one thing I disliked was the fact that they are held together with 2 big staples, which leave holes in the mats and are difficult to remove without some sort of tool like a flathead screwdriver. I cut myself in the process of trying to remove them and not rip holes in the mats. Also, they arrived a week later than the expected date because they were not shipped until it was a day before they were scheduled to arrive here. Overall good.
B000WK454K|5|I imported a new Suzuki King Quad to Thailand for use on the farm about four years ago.  Before bringing it over, I had the dealer put QuadBoss Tire Sealant in the tires,  I was an avid ATV'er in the US, but never encountered the kind of tire hazards routinely encountered here in Thailand. You haven't seen thorns until you've see the variety we have here in Thailand.  Some species of bamboo, for example, are spiked with giant needle sharp thorns that run one to two inches in length and are as strong as nails.<br /><br />I use the ATV for hauling and dragging.  I have cleared a lot of thorny bamboo and have driven right over the thorny canes repeatedly.  If you were to step on one of these thorns it would go through your foot (I wear sandals).  I have used the ATV a lot on a construction site as well and am sure I must have run over quite a few nails.  Never a flat or a leak.  By comparison, I have had repeated flats with my mountain bike, even though I have Ride-On Tire Sealant in the tires.  Motorcycles also get lot of flats.<br /><br />My treatment of the ATV tires has been nothing short of abuse, yet never a leak.  I swear by this stuff.  I have read a lot of other reviews where the product got less than five stars because the pump was broken or the customer could not get all the product out of the bottle.  All I can say to that is that where there's a will, there's a way.  Broken pumps and residual product may present a challenge, but at the end of the day, the question is:  &#34;Does the product work?&#34;  It works above and beyond all my expectations and if I could give it six stars, I would.  The QuadBoss sealant has saved me so much tire grief that if I had to blow it into the tires by the mouthful, that's how I'd do it.
B001CMV6SU|5|Great fit just fine little tall in height be sure that this cap clears your air filter<br />Otherwise performs as intended
B004YK9M0G|5|They look great. At first, I was afraid that they would be too big and block parts of my plate, but they are pretty small (about the size of a fingernail). The Cadillac logo is not visible from very far away, so if that's what you're looking for, this might not be for you. They DO click on; you just need to give it a pretty good push. At first it couldn't get it to click, but I used the back of my screwdriver and heard an audible click. The screws from the dealer were too big so I just found some screws with a smaller head lying around the house. They look clean and don't look or feel too cheap.
B0000AY69V|5|Has worked great. Cheap and easy to use and strore. Hopefully it will be durable.
B004DHLAGE|1|I'm on my second set and while I love the brightness, there are issues with these lights. The same thing happened on the second set. The unit on the left side of my car works well for awhile, then goes very dim. The other side of the car has the original light working fine. Also moisture problems as another reviewer stated. I'm now spending hours trying to find the same brightness in a light made in USA. Hmmmmmm.....not much luck so far. I have contacted the distributor via email and am waiting for response. Do your homework on this one.
B00RCKB10E|5|Very cute!!!!
B0002RNQCA|5|I had been looking for these everywhere!! Love them fit perfectly in my car!
B005R3SSMW|2|I purchased this to use full time at a shop. The lower lip is much wider than it appears in the picture and as such, won't fit underneath newer toyota cars where the filter is right next to the engine. Really not happy.<br /><br />However it does work for the SUVs and mini vans  where clearance isn't an issue
B002BHWZFI|5|Works well on snorkel gear.
B002GZD8JM|1|Terrible quality... Controller or receiver died after 1 week and aporx. 10 minutes of use. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap.
B0031ZDU62|1|These coils did not work on my 2004 Mercury Mountaineer. Actually made my SUV run worse. Maybe a bad batch of coils but either way I will not be ordering anymore.
B001NZUFN8|5|I have  had this item in my car for several years.  This one I purchased as a gift for a friend.  The pocket attaches easily to any car vent.  It holds sun glasses, pen. paper and my 4S i-phone.  Any larger sized phone will not fit in this pocket.  When we travel using my husband's car, I move the pocket from my car to his.  This is a favorite car item.
B001F1QTLM|5|Great stuff, fast delivery!
B002OPVU2G|3|I found the them to be what I was look'in for.
B0067EYHLG|5|these absolutely look amazing, their a very low profile and the LED's illuminate bright day or night!<br />only problem i have with these is they come loose quite often from the vibration of the bike. anyways these are a seriously nice buy :)
B00NQD21AK|5|Perfect
B00865EIHM|4|Nice light but poor quality
B001AIZ5HY|5|Pleasantly surprised.  This kit completely restored the lights on the front of our 2004 Chevy Suburban.  They were yellowed and had very poor light transition.  Rather than having to buy new lenses, I was also to bring them back to looking new.  I am very impressed and ordering another kit for my Sierra.  Do not expect to do more than one vehicle per kit.
B00FOX5KEY|1|Could be better.  Not sure if someone was asleep when my harness was built.  ONLY ONE RESISTOR on wiring harness!  This harness is suppose to PREVENT the &#34;headlight out&#34; warning but NOTHING is plugged into the passenger side factory headlight plug.  (Where's the SECOND resistor?)  The longer, passenger side power wire is TOO SHORT to reach to the other side and I had to extend it to make the install look more professional.  My install is on a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Sport.  When I cut the wire that extends to the other side, I was surprised to see the the power wire is really skinny.  It is THIN, definitely NOT 16 gauge, it is 18 gauge and not a great quality.  Also pictured is split loom insulation, which mine DOES NOT HAVE.<br /><br />No zip ties or screws to mount the relay.  No hardware!  I'm guessing less than $12-15 dollars in materials to make this harness.  Someone is making a decent profit on this.<br /><br />I bought this harness along with their 9006 HID kit.  I hope the HID kit was better built than this wiring harness.  Only time will tell.
B00HRH9H9O|5|Great product and fit my key well. Should have gotten sooner. I am not happy with the shipping. I got charged more for that than the product. It was sent to me via USPS but on invoice it said FedEx.
B000BHUMZU|5|My husband loved it.
B00L4N4594|4|Good product Some problems with bolt hole alignment but product was well built worked as it  was  designed to
B00C38RQYA|5|This little guys are super bright. Perfect fit for any enclosure they are very low profile. Would definitely recommend them.
B0009IK6G6|5|Took a chance...and scored! Fits the reservoir perfectly.  Just be careful with those electrical connections...likely they are pretty brittle, so there is a danger of breaking them...then you will have to &#34;hotwire&#34; the pump so it will work.
B004I0JUJ0|1|First off, it was broken in 2 places. Stuff happens, I get that, but it has glue on it. It was broken and a repair was attempted before it was sent to me.  I know it was cheap, but come on.
B000C1LLCS|5|Upgraded the rear brakes to akebono, I've had these on the front for 20k miles every good product.
B00FP0LHA2|5|Stronger than Apple cords.
B0002UQAXY|5|Needed to buff a new paint job, and was using the Meguires polishing compound.  Tried some cloth things, and they did not work.  This does work, and does a great job with as little effort as possible.  Much better than trying to do it by hand.
B00080QHMM|5|I am only concerned about how accurate it actually is. There is a couple pounds difference between my tire pressure monitoring system on the car and this gauge. This gauge is closer to the TPMS system then the cheap pencil style pressure gauge I was using and was thinking all these years I may have been running my tires on the low side on my vehicles that didn't have that pressure system because of that pencil style gauge. It is easy to use and easy to read.
B004ZF4MW8|4|Outstanding!!! Love them.
B001O10IJW|5|Everything was fine. The ordering, delivery and the installation all went well. They send you a video to help with the installation which really helped.
B000JFHMRU|5|GreatSeller,ItemPerfect,Emails,FastShipper & trustworthy-that’sImportant
B005OYBTPW|5|Great Quality
B000UPDP98|5|Fit perfect, great price.
B000A8JLIY|5|Great spark plugs. Car runs great. Easy to gap and install into your vehicle. NGK is worth the money. Reasonable price.
B000CQVLD2|5|Great product. Proper fit
B0009IQX2M|5|LEAVES A DEEP AND HIGH GLOSS SHINE AND HAS EXCELLENT WATER BEADING! WISH IT CAME IN A BIGGER BOTTLE THOUGH.
B002OUMVSS|4|This product arrived quickly and was exactly as described. I've used this brand previously and the quality is very good. The swivel fittings are a nice plus also.
B00252IF9O|5|Excellent filter for Deutz diesels.
B008UYKFDA|3|Great look on the Street Glide, but shows signs of wear (tarnishing)
B00HVVVEYM|2|I do like this, but after tightening one of the straps for the fifth time the sewed material ripped where the strap attaches. I didnt pull it very hard.
B000CI6YGE|1|Do not waste your time!!! im sending mine back right now. Not what is advertised and not the whole set.
B00873J0YY|5|Excellent
B005Z8HAUK|5|Haven't used it much yet, but seems to be a good product.  Time will tell.  Seems to the job as needed.
B003WHBVDI|1|I am an avid motorcyclist.  Purchased the REDA 1 gal can new for intended purpose, to carry spare fuel on a Goldwing.  Less than two years old and the container shows evidence of splitting at the thermo-formed seam which runs along the middle (container has two halves).  It has bulged due to expansion and pressurization.  It has not leaked liquid as of yet, but I'm not taking chances with this container on board and under my bumm, with the potential for vapor or liquid leaking into an enclosed hard saddlebag, located very near exhaust and electrical wiring.  I'd rather run out of gas in a remote location, than face a fire/explosive potential.  I bought this because of its robust looking design and construction.  I have cheaper poly containers(lawn mowers) that have held up better.  My advice...be careful...inspect often.  I have contacted the manufacturer to notify them of my experience.  My bike is stored inside in a relatively cool garage, rarely left in sun for long periods.
B003U8BLQQ|3|Ok.  I guess if we build cars with plastic (or any other composite material resembling plastic), we should expect them to break.    The original unit broke at the plastic flanges which then caused the cable to bind around the pulley on the motor.  After inspecting it (as you've probably seen for yourself) - there is no way to service this.  You've gotta buy a new one.    This one was shipped very fast!  It looked great and was ready to install!  Excellent!  Now if I can just get the window out of the bracket from the old one I'll be doing fine.    Everything we fine installing the replacement.  Bolts were already started and the hole process took less than 2 minutes to do.  As I lowered the window into the locking bracket - SNAP, one of the guides broke.      I don't know what to recommend as I was holding the carrier with one hand making sure it was aligned correctly with the flange of the window and slowly lowered the window into the carrier.  Just as the flanges that lock the bracket at the bottom of the window were about the snap into place - that's when the guide broke.    At a hundred buck each, I've decided to leave it in and let it ride until it breaks and then I'll address it again as only one of the brackets broke.  I know I should try to get a replacement but the fact is that I don't believe it's possible to do this process without breaking one of the guides.  It's plastic with a great amount of torque riding on 4 little guides.    O well.  It works and I'm happy - for now.
B001R91QN8|3|Thought it was a whole sticker - black numbers printed on a white sticker - instead, the black was cut out, and the white was the sticker - good for tinted windows or dark vehicles, but would probably look a bit washed out on an untinted window or light vehicle.
B00A0J8VH0|5|Excellent quality!  Just I expected from Audi.
B00RW7X2W2|5|DELIVERED ON TIME, EASY TO INSTALL, VERY GOOD VALUE!
B005KOZ25Y|5|Works great for a small price.
B002E1B6LK|5|Excellent product, great quality.  Like the fact that it came with the velcro attachment.  Extremely happy!
B0066SHPVW|5|Bought it because a shop didn't lower their floor jack enough and busted my old one out. Probably a 2 minute install once you find where the new pad is supposed to fit.
B009AYV9Q6|5|Boyfriend loves it
B002LEEX88|5|Love the tag!! It is perfect for my husbands car he loves it. Love the two day ship.It came real fast.
B001V8RYTA|3|I really did not need this for where i have my rug on my patio and I have plants on the corners and a table and chairs on. I will hold on to them for another rug to use outside at a later date.
B00IEFZ7JM|5|Worked very well. If you get a t harness for your specific application the &#34;wiring&#34; part of the install will be easier. I recommend you buy the programmer also because you will need it to enable certain functions that the evo may support for your car.  Overall I am satisfied.
B00A3V1ZIW|1|Garbage.. Bought this for a snowmobile trip where we were spending the night at different places.  After less than 300 yards a buckle broke and the bag then drug and ripped in several places spreading all my clothes for hundreds of yards.  Also lost expensive electronics!  The only good part was that we we're still close enough to our starting point that I was able to go back and transfer the remaining articles that were able to be found into a backpack.  Very disappointing.  I was excited to be able to not wear the backpack this year but this item was junk and failed right away.  I would not recommend this item to anyone.  Item is being returned.
B00CL8JBXQ|1|it doesnt fit my audi's key, it doesnt work at all.
B009FUF6DM|5|I couldn't believe I was buying cleaning cloths, since that is what RAGS are for!  But desperate to inspire my kids in their chores, I thought some nice, new cloths would help.  High reviews were the tjpping point.<br /><br />Now, *I* am the inspired one.  These hold a lot of liquid, are sturdy, wash nicely and scrub well.  Makes cleaning faster and easier.  I use them for everything.
B0002KQE4O|3|This does reduce some dents but is no miracle worker. It has no instructions for use, but when just sticking it on and yanking it off didn't work I tried a few differnet techniques.<br />The one that worked best was to wet it slightly for better suction then appply over dent and slide it around all sides and over the middle of the dent in a circular pattern while pulling as hard as you can without it popping off. It takes many many times and KILLS your hands, but does reduce minor dents in depth and appearance. I think one with a little better suction would do a better job.
B0009VF1DQ|5|I have several of these, one for each car and one for the house. Does a great job on dust, the best dash cleaner I have ever used--by far!
B000GV65T8|3|great product but no brackets to mount this with i wouldnt recommend this unless you have some brackets for this or can make your own
B00BGDHMBK|2|This touch-up paint is significantly darker than the original paint on the 2013 Nissan Altima it was used on.  Though, this may be the norm for touch-up paints since the original paint on the car is so thin as well as having a glossy clear coat over it.  Still, you can clearly see the areas touched up with this paint on the bumper.
B0015KROXU|5|Best cleaner on the planet. I have used dozens of bottles over the years.
B001C6JCEG|5|love it
B0006FKFMC|2|Glue kept pulling off the body. Tried a number of times with same results.<br />Just glad it did not cost more.
B004XN8MOG|4|I bought this relay for my 2007 Kawasaki Ninja 650R after I installed LED rear turn signals and was experiencing hyper flash. It plugged right in to the stock harness and even mounted to the stock rubber bracket. The flash rate seems a little slower than stock and I have noticed about a half second delay between sliding the turn signal switch and the first flash of the signal, but it is not an issue if you are signaling early as you should. It passed inspection and I timed it within the legal limit. It seems a little pricey for such a cheaply manufactured part, but it is still cheaper than a Kawasaki relay. I have had this on my bike for about 6 months without any problems.
B000GRW9LU|5|Bought these for a 78 CB550. If need new coils for an old bike do yourself a favor and purchase some new tech. Legitimate Dyna coils for under MSRP and in original packaging to boot.
B0054YCW62|5|Works perfectly!
B00684TIVE|5|Once programmed works greats. Saved me tons of money. Had to go work through the instructions twice but finally got it. Very pleased.<br /><br />Dealer wanted $150 for the remote and then more to program it.
B0009IQXAE|5|this detailer is very easy to use and works well when you clay your car , it makes the clay slide easy and also cleans up quick so you can get to the waxing
B005NWEWJU|5|Easy installation with a nice look..
B00NFSNAS8|5|I originally gave this a 3 star rating cause of a few issues i was having with it. Upon reading my review Joe from Kensun sent me an email about my concerns. He went above and beyond to rectify my issues! I wish all companies did business the way Kensun does. Im extremely pleased with his help and definitely look forward to purchasing more items from Kensun.
B00008RW9V|4|ok
B003YV5P7K|5|Fast.. Good quality.. Great service.. Recommended to everyone.. The item arrived a day early which is always good.. The item quality is really good..
B001LHVOVK|3|It works. I mostly got it to clear codes when friends and family don't tighten the gas cap enough.<br /><br />The CD it comes with doesn't work. So the codes in the book is all you have to go by. What most people don't know is that DTCs are pretty universal for certain car manufactures. So if you get a certain code like p1151 on a ford. You can google Ford p1151 and you can find out exactly what it is. This is basically the only way you can find out what it is, since the book goes so high and the CD doesn't work.<br /><br />If they made the CD work, it would get 5 stars, but not having those extra codes is a BIG problem.<br /><br />Although it doesnt give you an in depth explanation of what is going wrong its still an OBD II scanner for under 20 bucks. That makes it worth it.
B0001MII88|5|Good quality hose. Very reasonable price!
B00407V3KA|5|Its hard to find spray paint that doesn't come out in big blobs. This paint goes on perfectly and dries very fast.
B000G28PPE|5|Great paint wish I could find more to use on interior pieces
B004C444RA|5|I been using old felt gloves when riding my motorcycle and my hands would always be sore after I got home. This gloves are padded and feel tight.  These I would recommend to any motorcycle rider who looking for leather gloves.
B0007VU48K|4|So far it is a good battery. I just got it last month, So we shall see in a few years if it lasts.
B004SRA5PQ|1|If you are thinking about this exhaust manifold/converter please reconsider. The fitment is terrible. I had to modify several of the mounting bolts just to get it to work. In addition, it doesn't come with new exhaust studs/nuts so you will have to go buy some of those. Save your time and money and buy a diffirent brand that is not poorly casted and machined. Jim
B0068ERNNE|5|Quality product.
B00158UAE2|5|They work perfectly. Just as good of quality as any other disconnect tool i've used. Must have tool for your kit.
B0016P8O6U|1|Sockets not deep enough so whatever you plug into it works it's way out in just a couple of minutes.
B00JXLH7CG|1|Received this and it's definitely defective. Tried every possible combination of led/tungsten and led only bulb configurations in a 1984 Jeep CJ 7. On top of that it's not made in the US but in Taiwan so quality control is iffy - the plastic housing came apart after I removed it from my harness...
B000C14QM0|5|quality product
B000C9GZUS|5|It is very quiet which is alot more than I can say for the aftermarket units I have put into trucks in the past. Well worth the extra coupele of dollars to buy an OEM part for this application.
B001R8XOTI|5|I put this together with the other one I ordered.<br />If you can't stand behind out troops<br />Feel free to stand in front of them<br />NoBama<br /><br />I think they worked well together. All the people that said something to me about it , liked  it & wanted to know where I got it. I told them that they were 2 decals but I chose to put them together.<br />I posted this on my Facebook page as well.
B0052UQ0BQ|5|Exactly what I needed and the distance is pretty good The battery is still running great and I haven't had a problem yet (3 months of ownership).
B000UK8Q88|5|The camoplast blow molded skis installed fairly easily.  They performed well on my snowmobile and seem to be holding up well (300 + miles so far) no noticeable wear.  Would recommend if someone is looking for a less expensive pair of skis that perform decently.
B00HWS7TRK|5|I was concerned when ordering that the orientation of the LEDs being on opposite sides of the 'bulb' would not illuminate the 3rd brake light housing properly. I hoped that you would not be seeing 1 directly and the other indirectly via reflection. When installed though, they aligned perfectly by both shining sideways so that LEDs distribute light evenly. The bonus is that they instantly illuminate and produce more light than stock leaving one with a greater sense of safety.
B0053P69IO|4|This is a nice hitch. It was easy to install with two inexperienced guys. The only reason I give four stars is because you have to cut away the plastic below the back. The bolts around the exhaust are hard to get to with the tools I had handy.
B003N9MQCK|2|I had these sent to my grandmother, who takes all morning to sip her coffee.  When I went to visit her this spring, I found both cups in the closet.  And no wonder.  The cups were huge and cheap.  Not sure how these are foam insulated--what a joke!  I expected more for the price, and have seen similar quality at the 99-cent stores.  I am baffled by the positive reviews.
B00EZ0G1FY|5|Very comfortable mattress that stays somewhat cool. Not the normal memory foam that is difficult to roll in this one has a more stable top layer that makes it a little more firm and stable.
B00CB8WM2S|5|Car hammer feels like it was made very well. I hope I don't have to use it.
B009ZQ12F2|3|They do the job, but the plastic covers on the ratchet always come off.  I purchased these specifically because they have the plastic covering the handle.  Poor design.
B0009VIQ1A|5|There isn't much left to offer.  These things have been standard equipment at car shows for about 30 years now, and do exactly what they're designed for.
B00318JTCS|4|I LOVE THESE LIGHTS.<br />THE BLACKOUT LOOK NOT ONLY LOOKS GOOD, THE LIGHTS ARE CRAZY BRIGHT.<br />ONLY FLAW MY SWITCH DOES NOT LIGHT UP.<br />ITS REALLY CHEAP. MY COFFEE MAKER HAS A NICER SWITCH.<br />IF YOU BUY THESE LIGHTS DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY A NEW SWITCH.<br />I BOUGHT A SWEET SWITCH FOR $3.00
B00CI7BAWU|5|Looks great on my Wrangler & everyone keeps asking me where I got it!
B008FOVNEA|5|Perfect for my friends jeep. He will get a lot of looks at his up tight work. Exactly whats shown.
B004B7YXOM|4|Works great. I didn't use the CD at all and used the Torque app for my android phone.
B004I0IEP6|5|Exactly what I needed including the mounting spring. Installation was very easy. My original light just flew off on the highway for some reason, and I'm sure this was much cheaper than taking it in to the shop.
B0073UMCRO|5|good as gold as a replacement for my Aprilia solenoid.
B000BUU5Y0|5|I bought this to stabilize the wheels of the camper to limit the movement and bounce.  It fits well between the wheels, is easy to install, and is adjustable and grips tightly depending on how much torque you apply to the adjuster.  I tightened it a lot without issue.<br />It seems to be good quality and fits nicely between my 15&#34; wheels.  They did help stabilize the camper, and stop the wheel movement.  I spray painted mine black to make it stand out a little less, I just have to remember it's there before I try to move the camper.  I'm going to buy another one for the other set of wheels.
B0076UNZJK|4|These goggles are great. However, they fit my face perfectly, to a fault. They fit my face so well, that if I try to wear them over my helmet straps (which I prefer), the goggles are too tight, do not allow for proper air flow, fog up, and are uncomfortable. None-the-less, if I wear them under my helmet straps they fit like a glove, they have great ventilation and the photo-chromatic lens is great, especially when riding from the day into the night. These are great goggles that I would recommend to any motorcycle rider who needs to wear glasses.
B001B1K35Y|5|Wow much bigger than I thought and packs a lot of stuff. Easy to hook up to sissy bar with lots of connections so your bags stay secure. I am very pleased with this product and am ready for my road trip. Ride safe
B002ULDRKW|5|Received item in a timely fashion, looks great, item as decribed, highley recommend, great material not cheap, item was heavy material not the cheap plastic, Thank you!
B000EDUTX6|5|Better quality than I expected. Perfect fit for 1987 stove!!!
B0009IQXFO|5|as described
B001PWFPE8|5|Nice easy to install works great!!!!
B000CPI5XC|5|Been a red line fan since the days when they sold this stuff with hand written receipts in Martinez, ca. Cheap insurance especially for a hot PS unit.
B000CDADGG|5|blades install easy and provide for a good water swipe. heavy duty construction ensures blade stays in contact with the glass
B00S4QFGMO|2|Not as long as described (53&#34;).<br />More like half of that length.<br />I took it apart and soldered in longer wires.
B000C2FXB2|1|they were the wrong size for my car although i specified what kind of car i had
B002K4GGZW|5|I bought this window sticker \\"I drive like a Cullen\\" for my friend whose last name happens to be Cullen.  She (and her family) loved it!  Thank you for selling this great product!
B008KZKFNY|4|Works as intended. My sonata 2014 limited already had hooks so was easy to install. Since the net stretches left to right and narrow you can almost keep 3 grocery bags. So if you want to keep lots of grocery then you have to consider other options like a box that can be Velcroed down  or just keep card board boxes.  It still comes in handy during the quick grocery trips and avoids milk cans rolling around in the large trunk. I unhook when not in use.
B007TY4ZO2|4|This headlight fit my 2006 Cobalt LT. The black casing to which it holds the actual headlight in in the car did not fit at all so I used my old black casing. My lights are nice, bright and shiny!
B00480FIEG|3|Wrong fit for my Prius, but i was able to use it for something else.
B004EK94P4|5|Arrived super fast. Great stickers. Thanks!
B000CMHVK8|5|Was able to repair my Holley carb bolt hole in about 10 minutes.
B0052SF0LO|5|The light provides great lighting when you dont have a 120volt outlet available. The motion sensor works great and the build quality is top notch.  Amazing how much light the 60 leds put out.
B00KULAYX2|1|overheating, smoke and a very strong smell
B007OV7312|4|this looks beautiful and it came with matching chrome bolt covers as well.  My only negative is that there are inner tabs to hold the plate in place that kept me from installing the clear cover I had planned to install.  With so many bugs sticking to the front of a car I like to install a clear cover over the plate and you cannot do that with this item.  Looks really nice though!!
B0007ZHA8I|5|Helps a lot in eliminating the blind spot on the driver&#34;s side of our van. Easy to install and adjust. Thanks and I wish we had heard about your mirror sooner.
B00BI2A2AM|1|Liked forward to using this product as it's a favorite of mine. But unfortunately upon.first use, the felt backing came over. I purchased 4 different Wizards pads and 3 are going into trash after one use.
B002R0SC9W|2|I bought this as a replacement because my existing parking/signal lamp had moisture and fog on the inside.  After a couple days this new one did the same thing.  It only happened on the passenger side.  The drivers side worked great and stayed clear.  Not sure what the deal is on the passenger side.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|good item
B000C11PYW|5|works like a dream just as it says fill it up and it stops all the leaks great time saver
B00067BW0O|5|Very Unique and very happy with these lights, when night driving they are very bright white and it provides rich lighting on the road and wider view compared to my original 4300k. From far distance to oncoming cars view of the lights they appear and create a changing purple or a blueish look and I get compliments on them too. So far so good. Now to see if these PIAA set last a long as I expect from them as from my other sets of PIAA lighting I had purchased for previous vehicles of mine.
B005OSJGYY|2|Great custom fit.nonslip backing is nice. Quite smelly at first, but I let them sit out in my garage for a day or two, and the chemical smell went away.
B009LLXLDC|5|The quality of this item was not what I expected at such a cheap price. Excellent product and from the looks of it should last for many many years to come.
B0031B4YU2|5|GREAT PRICE..GREAT PRODUCT..I OWN A CLEANING COMPANY AND BUY THESE BY THE HUNDREDS
B0089SZXBG|3|I ordered one for Celica 2001.  I only can use the tensioner pulley and the hydrolic tensioner only.  Without looking, I p installed everything in.  When I try to put the belt, it won't fit.  Had to take the whole thing out, re-use my tensioner body with new pulley and hydrolic cylinder.  Re-installed - everything fine.
B00E975MPI|5|Nice product, easy to use, I like the texture, it not the shining one.
B004BV06ZI|5|So far so good.  The UPS is like new and holds a good charge.  I would buy it again.  Good job in building this replacement battery guys...
B000C5UFGW|4|Not quite the match for the factory original,but seems to perform flawlessly.Also,assembled in the USA.<br />The wiring harness was an exact match.
B000XECJES|5|nice and works great good price
B0052SF0LO|4|After an automobile break in in our driveway, I purchased two solar powered security lights.  This one and the [[ASIN:B008G39LXU eLEDing Pure Digital Solar Powered Motion Activated 60 LED Security Flood Lights]].<br /><br />I did my homework on this light and did the waterproofing as suggested by James in his review on September 27, 2013.  This has worked like a charm!<br /><br />Initially, I preferred the simplicity of the eLEDing light, but after 3 months the functionality is inconsistent.  Not so with this Sunforce - it consistently performs every night - more than likely due to the waterproofing.<br /><br />Now if Sunforce would only follow the advice from it's customers and do the waterproofing at the factory...<br /><br />UPDATE:  After 6 months the Sunforce is still working perfectly; therefore I am increasing the review from 3 to 4 stars and I have purchased another.
B000AL8VD2|5|works
B005KVLX50|5|This is the same as  the one I was going to get in Dallas for 95.00. If you need something to move boat or kayak or fence material,or a number of other uses,this is it. It has so many ways to adjust it is great.
B002R2CFVG|5|I give this 5 stars.  I used it to drain the hydraulic oil and change the filters in my tractor. The tractor holds 11 gallons of oil and this drain is a must have.  It has baffles inside so that the oil doesn't splash all over when you move it around.  It also has a 3/4 in. fitting with a ball valve so you can drain the old oil right back into the empty containers that the new oil came in.  You just have to slip on the length of hose that works best for you for draining.  I just rolled the oil drain into the front loader bucket when I was going to empty it and raised the loader about a foot off the ground and put the hose into the empty oil containers and turned on the ball valve  to drain the oil, and turned the valve  off when the containers got full.  Never spilled a drop of oil!  This unit also has a removable full size screen on the top for turning your oil filters upside down to drain them.  Unit is well made and will last for many years.  Highly recommend it.
B01139EZH0|5|The reason I bought this wiring harness, DOT will give you eight $45 ticket if you backup light doesn't work, for some reason the manufacturer stop Makin the light with the backup light, I have been looking for a year and a half for replacement with no luck, thanks for saving me a ticket I sell in this, no more headaches David
B0064RD47E|5|Great substitute for DonJoy's leg sleeve that costs two times as much.
B0051MYLS4|5|very nice tool to have.
B00HVPOZMQ|5|Great
B000GVN974|5|To my surprise,  this bikini top is as nice or nicer than the bestop it is replacing.  Fits like a glove and has two more securing straps than the bestop bikini top. For the money, this is a excellent product.
B002JSM7HA|4|I bought the item for a colleague of mine.<br />He never complained back, so I assume he is satisfied with it.<br />I will definitively recommend this item, as well the seller.
B005VFWOOE|5|It's super sticky to your hand and not your car window until after 2 days of it being pressed onto it. Once it's on there it's for good though.
B001GEVBO8|4|It raised my tacoma up a little making it look better and stiffing up the ride so it handles better. I only gave it 4 stars because it was a little tricky to install. I had to call a buddy to help
B002VVGPE6|5|I have a 2013 Ultra Limited and I absolutely love this windshield!  It looks great and functions even better.  It really does channel air up and around your head allowing for greater distance riding.  I'm average height and I can see just over the top as I hate looking through windshields. The biggest bonus is the ability to use T-Bags with such a low profile curvy windshield.
B005G112A0|3|The ice scraper works well.  I wouldn't pay more than $1.  In fact that is what you will pay if you go to any dollar tree store.
B005FH2Q4Q|1|Did not come with cigarette adapter ...fuses ...or fuse block as shown in picture ... Also was a day behind on the shipping
B0002JM69W|3|didn't last very long before it started coming apart
B0007RDVEI|5|Does a great job as a finishing coat over almost anything. Adds luster and depth especially to black cars. Probably 4-6 cars per bottle. Highly recommended.
B008BSWPT2|5|Had to get a replacement and didn't feel like going to the dealer so this was my solution to my problem Great replacement fits like the original on my 2006 eclipse gt great price
B00L3FUVFK|5|Have to say by far the best air compressor I have gotten ...way to go kensun..A must have for sure ....works great and easy to use
B00COOQXZQ|5|I got more visibility after installing these lights on my Dodge Caravan but not only that, they also look great on my van
B0074APXUG|5|What just what it was supposed to be.  Adhesion is good and detail looks good. I would get more if I need it. Good stuff.
B00CO78DF6|3|I didn't have high hopes for this hub kit with how cheap it was. Worked like a hub kit should. The horn contact on mine was not making any kind of connection though. Not a huge deal if you don't need a horn, but this was for my daily driver which was an issue for me.
B00COYNZJ8|4|This is a great novelty item but the quality is not the best. Seems very cheaply made and the picture quality is very low. But for how low of a price you can expect much more than that.
B00807HTGS|5|They come packaged together, you just have to get them in the right spots on your bike. They look good and don't scrap off when you use tools on them.
B007WMYB2W|5|To cold out to put it on car affraid glue wont stick
B00030DLEE|4|i rated this 4 stars because this box is great for heating ur food up..the only thing is i wish it was a little bigger
B004HATFNC|5|Happy to own it, easy to install whit the instructions given And looks good on  my 2010 scion xb ...
B00K7VE2VK|5|Here in California we have a water shortage but I don't want my car to be dirty cause we can not use water to wash vehicles. I was hoping for the best and I got that and then some. It left my car shining like I had spent hours waxing it. Very happy with this product and have told friends about it and they to are happy with the results.
B003NWV8Z8|5|So far so good with my order. Nicely packed and on time delivery.Thanks.
B0105VNLX6|3|It's ok haven't got the chance to use it on a engine yet but lift my cab with problems<br />Also don't come with Jack pipe only comes with ram
B001FCLZVU|4|I had to modify and shorten the upper mounting brackets to get it to fit on the S-10 ZR2 truck. But once on, it looks great.
B001UCCNDO|1|This regulator may be for another Lexus model. It was labelled correctly on the site, packaging, and product appeared to be correct. However, when compared with the OEM regulator, it was slightly different looking. Upon installation, the fit was a little off, but installed successfully. Once we tried to operate the front drivers window though, we found the window only rolls halfway down. This was not due to wrong installation, but the product itself has shorter arms than the OEM piece and allow for less travel. We threw this in the trash and had to go to the Lexus dealership to pick up a genuine Toyota part. I figured the price was too good to be true.
B00CIV11XY|4|Console cover did not fit at all. It's unusable. The rest fit fine.the gray cameo is nice
B002MQCYO0|5|Tried many things to clean and polish my motorcycle and find this to be a must have item. It makes removing bugs easy and leaves a nice polished shine. It is also anti-static which helps keep the dust from sticking to the surface of your paint.
B005DNIOOS|5|I used this on interior door and dash trim pieces and I found it very flexible and easy to use. I used a heat gun for sharp curves and it stretched and stuck very nicely. It's been nearly a year and it's still on there and it looks great.
B00G3K1Z32|5|awesome cleaner & polish I will always use this on my Harley Davidson and tell all my friends about this product
B00EC0Z4XW|5|3rd time's a charm.
B001B5EIYW|3|Appears OEM and contains key information from the manufacturer. Contacted Amazon for a replacement. Stay tuned.    UPDATE: Replacement kit arrived and contains alignment tool. However, alignment tool states    \\"03 FORD.\\" So, there. Before buying this kit, have a devised method of centering the the disk. Either a universal tool set or what have you.    This kit performs well.
B004ETGQKG|4|Arrived in great shape ready for the snow now.
B00JJR38NQ|5|Great Product
B000C3XD90|5|Bought it for my 09 Lancer ES best investment keeps the oil running much quicker than the stock ones. Will order them again when i need more.
B0089LSFJ0|5|Not too much to say product wise, the coolant is exactly what I needed for the timing belt installation I was doing. Honda parts and fluids are always top notch quality and reliable. If you need coolant for your Honda, don't go cheap, buy Honda Fluids always. There is a certain peace of mind, knowing you used fluids designed for the parts in the car.
B0014HXF6O|5|I think this is a good investment for my scion xb as it actually improved my acceleration. sound is different from stock and made my car a little bit faster. The only thing I didn't like is you can't really see the air intake as the cone filter is hidden out of sight after the installation. Very happy with the purchase and its worth every penny. I paid less than $160 for it and $45 for labor to install it. so total $200.
B000CMGZSW|5|Fits good and looks good
B00KX8R5N4|1|This product was very bad. It came out with a cut out of no where.
B004OAE58A|5|Having the magnet bleeder bottle attach to the disc made bleeding the brakes a snap.  Combine that with the blue brake fluid easily being seen when the old fluid was fully drained made bleeding the brakes easier than it ever has for me.  I would definitely recommend this product and will use it again!
B006TO7VCQ|5|my friend loves it
B007TG7IKI|5|They were promptly mailed, and I immediately installed them, and they are working fine.<br />This is a good value for the money.
B0002UEOLO|4|Standard anti-seize
B007REFW32|5|The item description and picture was very accurate.  It arrived on time and was in perfect condition.  The instructions were accurate and made application easy.
B00NNGJO4Q|1|Worst bulbs ever. I failed to read the reviews before I ordered these. Now I seem to be stuck with them because the seller has chosen to ignore my return request. Do not buy. They don't work.
B00FB3GDXE|1|Did not like at all the letters was on a small piece of paper that fell off.
B001E8N6YE|5|This is the first jacket I own, so far, I've ride with it on 47 Farenheit temperature and protects you a lot, very confortable.
B0058DIAPG|5|Exactly what I was looking for!!
B00867HUMK|5|Got them on time and are what I expected.Put one under the hood of both my Jeeps.They seem to be quality stickers.
B00JWRMQ7C|3|It's not as Krystal shining as it looks... But it's ok for the price.
B001AVSIOI|1|I had the same problem. My 1469 DAT has a usable shaft length of only 3 1/4 inches, not the 3/12 inches advertised on the package itself and will not work on my Chevy 2500 2 1/2 inch receiver!  I emailed Masterlock, and they won't refund my money.
B001OYRGJ4|3|Smaller than I'd hoped
B0025OT0QE|5|I have purchased all my fuel system parts from here, and all of them were made by spectra o.e replacement parts. They have been perfect fits each time! Buying parts from amazon has been so easy.
B004KAVRNK|1|Not easy to assemble. No directions. Missing pieces. Do not recommend this product.
B000NOO798|4|it worked!
B004A9STG4|3|Receive and installed the rack with no problems.  It appears study enough for hauling light items on the roof of my Jetta.  Had it out on the highway today for a short trip with nothing on it and it was Extremely noisy, a BIG ROAR on the roof. Can't tell if it's the mounts or the rectangular bars, but I won't be leaving it in place for roadtrips.  Good news is it did come off just as fast as it went on, about 10-15 minutes total.
B000CO7E6W|1|Piece of junk. Broke on the micro thin plastic hinge the first time I closed it.  Dont waste your money.
B000143LHY|5|Works great for smoke!
B00DGTOOLS|3|owner manual not giving too much information how to use this meter.
B007QBQ3O8|1|A Brand new Acdelco for less cash than a rebuilt one at the auto parts store....Yes please. Oh but the pulley blades are bent and no one will help you. Oh no I guess you shoulda spent a few dollars more and got from box store that doesn't sell B grade stuff
B00BYGM9FS|5|Great addition to the look of the dash. No problems with installation.
B0009TAOBC|5|There's nothing wrong with it, and it's the right size.  I figure that's good enough for a towing ball to get give stars.
B00VKM3PSQ|5|All great products!
B001G7SL4S|5|The product was good and what I wanted, it came complete and all parts were up to standard and I got it on time... 100% satisfied.
B003CEODQI|5|Brackets are going to work out good for my highlift Jack
B00FW29S68|4|These are easy to install. This camera is much better than the others I've tried on Amazon ( as expected since I did pay much more for this one). It does come with everything you need for an install for aftermarket head unit. Mine came with a 3.5&#34; dash mount monitor. I wasn't expecting one since they didn't specify that in the product description. I guess I will just sell the monitor. They may have sent this by mistake so I would ask the seller before buying, if you need one.<br /><br />My only suggestion to them is to upgrade to a thicker, better quality cable for the price.  You can't use a different cable since it's a special connector that has both video and power. I was a little disappointed by this since I had a quad shielded, higher quality video cable already ran to the firewall from a previous camera but I had to remove it to use the smaller cable supplied.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this camera kit. I would buy it again but I do hope they take my suggestion to upgrading cable to a better quality.
B006FDD74W|2|Didn't fit my model even though it said I had the right key I have a 2007 honda civic coupe
B00LPU8SJO|4|Very nice set of cables and I'm very pleased
B008RO3CIS|3|Looks really good on my car. Only reason it's getting a 3 star rating is because the center bottom clip doesn't stay clipped in and therefor it curves up te bottom on the grill. But it still stays place well and without the one clip and still looks good.
B003IS3HV0|5|I love this leather conditioner!  Originally, I wanted something that would soften and stretch the hard leather of some heels that pinched in the toes.  But before I bought it, I emailed Leather Honey to ask them if this was possible.  Not only did I get a response the same day, I got the response I was looking for.  (Leather Honey did recommend a shoe stretcher along with the product in my situation.)<br /><br />So far, I have used it on numerous pairs of heels that were scuffed or beginning to get dry and now they look brand new.  Actually, a couple pair look better than they did when I bought them!  I trust this product enough that I intend to use Leather Honey on my handbags (such as my Coach, Michael Kors, Kenneth Cole, and other expensive bags), and several leather coats and jackets that have been long overlooked.<br /><br />Leather Honey is easy to apply.  I use my fingers to spread it on, then I massage it into the leather and let it absorb overnight.  The following day, I use a lint-free microfiber cloth to wipe off the excess conditioner, and the leather looks perfect.<br /><br />I have finally found a product I like and trust and that is easy to use, so I will definitely be using it on a regular basis to keep my fine leather in excellent condition.  I have already recommended Leather Honey to others based on my experience, but then, the result speaks for its self.
B00904WS48|5|Got this jacket as a birthday gift for our son.  He absolutely loves it. Good quality, great fit. I would purchase this jacket again.
B00LUSTUXE|3|Watch video for correct size.  Didn't work for me.....
B009T4OC3Y|5|worked perectly on my 2008 Tahoe
B00N5C28BO|5|Couldn’t ask for more from a gravity siphon.  Worked well.  Quality materials.  Should last a long time.  I was able to pull about 15 gallons out of my truck so I could change the fuel pump.  Only had about a ½ inch of gas left in the deepest part of the tank when I took it apart.
B00F5DWEVK|4|these are good parts. I put them them on our Audi Q5 2011. It's just as good or better than the original part. I can't attest to the longevity of the product, but the price is reasonable.  Stopping power is good. The noise is good. I use them with the Centric Posi Metallic pads.<br />Quiet Smooth with good Stopping.<br /><br />we have not had an emergency stop, though the antil locks kicked in the other day in the snow-<br />these are carbon steel rotors, so they show rust (until you brake the rust away).
B00DLZSAAI|4|Not Waterproof.... Maybe water Resantant...
B009082VDC|5|These are great. Very sturdy. I love them. I use them to haul ladders all day, no problems. Great price.
B00ALLYRV6|5|Pretty cool.
B004G8NMUW|5|it looks great on my newly custom painted car and it got to my house at the same time as stuff I had prior ordered and shipped pretty fast too
B00GB107VO|5|Would gladly purchase this product again.
B00FBKSBA0|1|Not wood
B00CXADHHS|5|Great vanity bulbs.
B00G1YF068|5|bright light as advertised
B004LEHHAM|5|I love it
B00A34LG9W|1|Horrible reception and it fades
B005FI5BBA|4|Great gift for my daughter and son-in-law Doctor Who fans! I have no more to say than that it is a royal pain that Amazon demands a longer response when I do not what to write a longer response.
B00KDBRHYS|4|Didn't fit my Kia...refunded
B003LFR4PK|5|This saved me hours of work.  Instead of having to remove the intake manifold, I plugged this in and relocated my new PMD to an easily accessible and cooler location.  It took just 5 minutes.
B002LCD9XU|5|Went on easily and the size is perfect!
B007AMTA8E|5|The best yet!!!!!
B0042FMS2C|5|Came in quick and catches oil.
B007EHOWNI|4|Drove through the car wash with the antenna up. I want my radio to work and I don't want to drive around with 6&#34; of antenna sticking up, that's gonna break off and start flopping around scratching the paint. It's a 12 year old vehicle too. It works properly and nobody has noticed it's not factory but they noticed the broken factory one.(Easy to R&R)
B000IG5PZQ|1|Junk, worked for about a week.
B0049IFX56|3|This is not a Tiny Tach by far.  It works,  but the readings are slow to respond. I'm not sure of the durabilty
B00ANO7JSE|5|Holy moly!  Took away a considerable amount of the drive train slop in my 14 WRX.  Easy install with a jack and hand tools.  A must for anyone looking to get a lot more for a little coin!  Slight increase in NVH, but nothing close to a deal breaker! Well worth it.
B002PE95ZA|5|Another quality Liqui Moly product. I didn't have time to run a proper diesel purge procedure on my beater, so I tossed this in a tank of bio blend (b50) and drove on. So far, so good.
B0014VQM38|5|Fast & easy to set up when in a hurry...
B001Y8XPDQ|4|Bought these to replace the aged wheel covers on our 99 Suzuki Swift. They look great, I was impressed with them for how little they cost. They were a bit tight fitting into the rim but I don't think they'll accidently pop out and fly down the road. Overall a great buy.
B003XFTUHI|4|The picture was clear and as shown. The only con I could really see is that the license plate was a little flimsy.
B002LEEX9W|3|I agree with the other reviews on the quality and well worth the money compared to other options.  However, the photo shown with straight across lettering using the same model number is not what I received.  A apparent new design is being used....The raised lettering is smaller and in a crescent shape within the top and bottom space.  This makes them hard to read from any angle except straight on and close to it.  The Nebraska logos are as pictured.  This new design may be really cool and different for some but for me I think it is just okay and would have preferred the old design which is currently pictured.
B0082365AQ|5|nice but doesnt fit my kayak well
B000K8WYQA|5|Gave to my brother in law for Christmas and he loved it! Thanks for a great product and quick service!!!!
B00P3BL6EK|1|while they look awesome on the car the lights had an ill fit and after a week the right housing started collecting moisture and even after drying it out (which took forever) it did it again.  Very disappointing!!
B0089T068U|4|as expected and on time
B0060NOHM8|5|These mirrors are great for my 2007 Ford Ranger, sice they don't make a mirror that just slips over the origional mirror.  The Grand Aero simply bolts on my Ranger mirrors and securly stays there even at freeway speeds.  They don't move around like the strap on mirrors.  If you want a simple way to mount a great built mirror these are what you need, a little pricy but well worth the money...GREAT PRODUCT!
B00NJ43SSU|5|These grab handles are very cheap and arrived quickly. I also like that they are OEM, so you know they will fit your Wrangler. I have a '15 Wrangler Unlimited and installation was simple. You simply wrap them around the roll bar, probably takes a couple minutes at the most. Just remember that for the front row, you'll likely need to remove the roof (I've got the Freedom hard top and removed the front two panels) to make the wraparound much simpler.
B007HRLGG6|5|good quality
B00CFCI30K|5|Good floor mats. They are a perfect fit for my Escape 2010. Good product.
B003HB5WJS|1|Very disappointed.  When we opened the box and took them out two of the hubcaps already had broken tabs so we couldn't use them.
B00HU6U9X0|4|The product is decent to make it presentable on the rim.  A good replacement for the price sold.
B001AIZ5HY|5|Excellent product, I tried this on my car head lights which had many scratches. After using this I completely restored my car headlights. I strongly recommend this product
B001DVT28Q|5|Great product changed the handling characteristic of your car each setting gives you a different feel great for street and track
B004FCWH3W|5|I love this. I don't have to worry about pulling out the placard every time we need it and hanging it on the rear view mirror. Instead I just pull down the visor and we're ready to go. It's so much easier. One of the best buys I've ever made.
B00E7VES1U|5|Good
B00BQVVV2I|4|This item was very easily installed. Running the wires would be so much easier if you have access to a lift or have ramps. Only 4 stars because I too, like others received the wrong instructions. Called Blue Ox and CS said they would email instructions....never did get them. I found and printed instructions on their website.
B00NY0S2OY|3|This is an ok cover for the price. It is not water resistant, so I sprayed it with some 3M water repellent used for tents and camping. Size is good for large bikes with full luggage.
B00H7LPKKU|4|Did the job.
B000JZZ8CG|5|prefect fit, quick shipping, helped replace the antenna I broke while clearing snow off my car.  GM dealership wanted $200 to replace!?!?!?! under $20 for the part and 15 seconds to install
B006MJSUD2|5|Great deal
B002UC17GW|5|The old Bargman lens on my motorhome were faded and needed replacement.  I ran across these while doing a search and thought, 'Why Not'..  The replacement was as easy as removing the old lens and bulb.  Inserting the bulb base that is attached to the LED lens/light and rescrewing the lens/light back onto the base.  The combo lens/LED light is not much thicker than the old lens.  Simple, easy and the lights are awesome.  I recommend these to anyone who wants to update the tail/stop lights on a Bargeman 84,85,86 style light to LEDS...
B007W88A6E|5|Matches my Ebony Pearl paint job perfectly.
B00T9LR2BQ|5|Worked great on plastic.  Not quite as effective as Rain-X for glass, but worked well.  Definitely recommended.
B00BSGN5L6|4|Nice soft light. Not quite as bright as regular bulbs. Seems well made. Hope they will stand up to the tough life of RVing. Time will tell.
B00J8KVLGK|5|Son just purchased his first home.<br />Kitchen is being made into a 50's themed diner.<br />He loved this!
B006T77ZRE|5|My husband went crazy with this Cap. He is a Benz lover and he now drive his Benz and use his AMG Cap! The material has great terminations, and have a look of carbon fiber on the side. Also Nice texture.
B004WNTE8A|4|Super bien
B00MHJUM1Y|5|Very good product
B0066SZ6H2|5|Excellent product, easy install.
B00403LNQI|5|Bolted right on and seems to keep any sway out of  the hitch itself.
B0093BZ1EC|5|look great on my 01 jetta. perfect fit
B0015PK3AG|5|Works great and shipping was fast
B004NOPEN2|5|Got here just in time and works wonderfully. We were all sold out in my area and I needed this baby, desperately. It's pretty large, but stores easily. Really glad I got this.
B003A6SL1G|1|Grip came right off the accelerator DURING A RIDE!!!!  These are cheap pieces of garbage and DANGEROUS!!  I replaced them with Avon spike grips and the quality difference was OVERWHELMING.  These are aren't even fit for a childs toy pedal-motorcycle.  Garbage.
B000ES9E8C|5|Installed this in a Bergman &#34;porch lite&#34; fixture in my RV bathroom. Enough light to see and won't blind you since it's red light!
B00JA3BMDW|5|Bought to use on fish fries. Works great. Much better option than a metal thermometer that would come with a fryer kit. It also easily changes to read different materials. Worth the cost.
B004VGAJOG|5|exactly as pictured - order was problem free
B0002NIKGQ|5|These fit my 2008 Chevy Equinox. They are a little short and do not clip in like the old mats did, but they fit snugly on the carpet and there is no slippage. The black mat on the grey carpet of the car actually looks nice, especially with the gold emblem. I am replacing the old mats in front because rock salt and stones over 5 years caused them to develop holes. The Chevy automotive store wanted $160.00 for a complete set of 4 mats. These are nice heavy mats, and I can recommend them to all you Chevy owners. They do not fit perfectly, but are rubberized and very washable.
B005CWA5PG|5|Worked great great price im very happy would purchace again a must have for any doit your yourselfer very satisfied
B000BNS7Y2|5|This tyre guage is the best I have ever owned. Super accurate and easy to use . A excellent product.
B004MMZV42|1|I ordered these in the hopes that they would have the same deep yellow tint as the ones I ordered 3 years ago from another site. Sadly, the tint is barely even what I'd call yellow. It's a very pail yellow, maybe HALF the tint my other ones had, maybe even only a third. Not happy at all. Looks yellowISH is all.
B000FQ7AFW|5|Fit my 59 CJ5 perfectly.
B004L3MLYU|4|I really like the fit and comfort of the helmet, would rather wear this any day over my full-face (except rain and freeze haha). But yea, great little helmet, only disappointed that it doesn't sit lower on my head. But, I realize that it would be very difficult to get a helmet that will stop my brain from smashing on the street and sit lower on my head than this one does. So be it. Lastly, BIGGEST disappointment about this helmet is the fact the the picture makes it seem deceptively grey/black. It has ALOT of silver flake which makes it much more shiny than I'd prefer. But I can live with it. Keep your knees in the breeze brother
B009M0TKG4|5|This part came quick and worked perfectly. Great price! Save over $500 doing buying the part and installing it myself. My only complaints are the washers for the screw holes on the back side of the handle have no way of sticking so installation is made more difficult. A little elmers gue keeps them stuck long enough to line up the holes and get the bolts installed. Additionally, the door handle seal isn't a complete seal so I re-used the the one from the old door handle assembly.
B002P8DHUU|5|Fits just perfect. Cant  ask more for the price plus arrived in 3 days whti Prime.
B00APN8YTG|5|I bought this IV2 helmet so that I could have a helmet to ride with on my new street bike.  I got the helmet soon after ordering it (before the estimated delivery date) and opened the box to find it perfectly protected.  The helmet is very light so my neck does not get fatigued while riding on a longer ride and fits snugly around the head and neck.  The retractable sun shade works great and is easy to maneuver with our without gloves.  It retracts completely into the helmet so it does not block vision at all.  It is a joy to wear and I will look to IV2 when I need more helmets.  Thank you.
B000GZNEHK|2|Does not cover saddle bags.
B000HZUXNW|5|My husband loves to throw all kinds of junk into the back seat, and this was our compromise. It's sturdy, doesn't get in the way of backseat passengers, and best of all you can stuff loads of stuff into it. Love it. Get it. Use it.
B00EPYE21A|4|This mount allows MAF to be installed anywhere in the CAI, at any angle. Should have come with MAF mounting screws.
B000VL23VC|5|This is a caveman easy job.  You can change the filter in about 5 minutes at a cost of about 25% of what the dealer would charge you.  1. Open glove box.  2. Remove the single phillips screw from the support bar on the right side of the glove box door and pull the bar (you only need to move it slightly) away from the side of the door.  By design, the bar will retract some when you let it go.  3. Drop the front of the box down. (The door won't fall off.)  4. As I recall, there is a plastic cover over the end of the filter that snaps  off.  Depress the tab on the end of the cover and remove it.  5. Pull out old filter.  when you pull the filter out pay attention to the air flow direction stamp on the side of the filter.  6. Paying attention to proper air flow direction on the new filter, slide it in place.  6. Complete the remainder of the job by reversing the above steps.     Note, there will be some slight resistance when you pull the support bar down to place it back on the side of the golve box door.  The resistance is minor and normal.
B001KQF6PC|1|I'm sure that's what the problem was because as soon as I installed it the vents started working again before it would only blow through defrosters. A week later I locked it into 4x4 and it immediately stopped working. I didn't know where these were from but I figured being much cheaper than from the dealer I thought I would try them. Well as soon as I opened the box I saw &#34;made in china&#34; on it I didn't have much faith it would hold up but geez 1 week?? The factory part normally sells for $240 from Ford but I found them on ebay for 106 oh and made in the good ole USA so don't waste your time with these
B0069RODCY|5|Just like the OEM, only a different color. No complaints, this was a good value, even with this cost of shipping added.
B008Y3Q9NW|5|On time Just as fine
B000CO9U82|5|My titan with a 6\\" lift was averaging 14.2 mpg before I installed the intake. Now im averaging 17.5 !!! Well worth the money! And now it actually sounds like a big V8 when you want it to.
B004U8JH84|5|good price
B0036E9VB6|5|It works great for everything from sportsballs to small car tires to big truck tires. It does run a bit hot and the cords could be longer, but if you want to have a portable compressor in your vehicle that will keep your tired properly inflated (good for everything from regular passenger car uses to off road trucking when you need to lower tire pressure to get through rough terrain, and then pump the pressure back up for road use), this is going to fit the bill.
B00F7GYU3A|2|Printing quality was very poor, don't buy it you will be disappointed.
B00VNBDWPK|5|beautiful
B0096B9PC8|5|Great Denso radiator...fit well and works great so far.  True blue parts did a good job with secure, safe shipping. Thanks!
B0009VIQ1A|5|One of the best car dusters I have ever had! Living in  Cali, there is plenty of dust and dirt!!
B001RV78F6|3|I received my Jack Skellington decal, althou it says vinyl above, it is clearly not.  It looks almost 3D on the photo, clearly white, but when you order it, unless you are looking for it you don't see that it says Chrome.  It came just as a silver piece.  The face is the same but the color and detail in the paint is not. It's a flat silver.  I contacted the seller who told me it was a reflection of the way it was captured on camera but, it looks way different so yes I was dissapointed. Since the one I see here does not exist I think I just kept it. It's cute, it's ok... I was just exited to see 3D effect and it was not.  It's on my car now.  But If I ever find one that is really vinyl and looks like the one above I will change it.
B0041VO8A2|1|When I bought these, I thought they would add a nice touch to my G. After about a month, I went to check my air pressure and I could not remove these from the valves! The thread corroded onto the valve stem. I had to use a pair of pliers to remove them. Most of the thread was gone. Anyway, just put on a nice set of aluminum stems that I have on the other car and these are going in the trash.
B004A6I2TG|4|This fit where it should but be aware that the threaded port at the bottom for the temperature sender is slightly oversize and requires several layers of teflon tape added to the sensor to keep it from leaking and hold it in place. It came with an o-ring but there is little surface to seat it on the original sensor. It is functioning correctly so far and the price was much lower than dealers or local autoparts stores so you takes your chances.  I was pleased that the Trany cooler lines (shown in the picture) were included.
B000IYR7HW|4|worked ok
B004B0C1NE|5|I like this device because some apps are compatible with both OBDII and bluetooth apps, such as &#34;Torque&#34;, &#34;Dashcommand&#34;, and other apps. I highly recommend this product to anyone else who wants to find out how to trouble-shoot and view codes and reset the Engine Light. It may or may not save anyone from going to a mechanic and spending tons of money! Thanks for the prompt and speedy delivery! :-)
B000EQRINC|5|good deal
B00JRG2F1A|5|Absolute best ratchet tie downs I have ever purchased.  I have purchased enough cheap imported ones at the big box stores and have them break or the ratcheting mechanism wear out I could have purchased these once and still had money in the bank.  Very sturdy and hold my Yamaha Rhino in place.
B00EUE3ZHC|5|It is very good product and good quality. Very useful and easy to use. Thank you to get the product in good condition.
B00O3OI1ZU|5|best quality sticker for your vehicle. ive already washed and parked in sun and still looks brand new!
B001K7TZ6C|5|Look like a badass, even if you aren't. If you don't shave your face, you will regret buying this.
B00AVA4AGY|5|great
B00196QKBC|5|It took me about 45 minutes to install and that was pretty good in lieu of never having done this before.  I do enjoy doing things with my hands, extrapolated to mean being self sufficient.  I wish other mind bending problems could be solved this simply.
B0006JLU2C|5|This works very well on cars, too, if you don't feel like doing a whole wax job. It's good stuff. Brings out a nice little shine.
B000EDUTQ8|5|I've used them for almost a month now having dumped the tanks on my RV at least 3 or 4 times. they don't seem to leak and operate smoothly. the new hardware was a nice bonus since my existing hardware was completely unsalvageable. for the price you can't beat them.
B004JPLLPU|5|good fit
