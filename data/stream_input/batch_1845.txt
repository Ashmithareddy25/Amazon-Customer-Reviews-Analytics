B000HKW7E0|5.0|Christmas Vacation is a necessary part of our Christmas tradition.  We have watched it so many times we have worn out the VHS tape, so purchased the DVD from Amazon.  It would not be Christmas around our house without it. It is one of the best and funniest &#34;Vacation&#34; movies made.  We love it because it reminds us of our family nut-cases and all the headaches that come with the holidays.  The soundtrack is full of all our favorite Christmas tunes, the comedy is always funny and the cast just works so well together.  A must see!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The preview was such a teaser, I look forward to the third season, it looks like it will add a new dimension and bring it all to a great conclusion.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this games, my four year old grandson showed me this game and I loved it, although he is much better than me!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|These two had instant chemistry that needed to get past their insecurities to flourish. An enjoyable story and realistic characters.
B008JDAC7G|5.0|This game is so totally cool, I has you on point, and relaxes your brain from thinking about life and bs!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Martel paints his characters with humor and appeal and his settings are very visual.  I found the book enjoyable, over all.  However, I found it difficult to emotionally engage in places and was disappointed with some weak elements near its conclusion.  In fact, I found the end pretty unsatisfying in its mechanics.  From this reader's perspective, some seemingly important concepts laid out in the beginning, fell apart as the story progressed.  The Author's Note claims,  &#34;I have a story that will make you believe in God.&#34; and there are some great ideas entertained with hilarity and joy along that vein. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, what started out as a charming call to choose to believe in GOD, any god, even all gods, became bogged down in the details of survival and the convention of a third party interview report.  I would recommend Life of Pi... it just hasn't earned a permanent place on my bookshelf.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Not sure if it was a problem with my wi-fi connection or someone hacks into you system but this is the second time a movie at the ending (which is pivotal to any great movie to say the least)  it freezes up. Thanks for having such movies available . Wonderful performances great plot and keeps you in suspense.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This is the first time I've reviewed a movie on Amazon. That alone says so much about this movie. If you are a fan of MIB this is NOT a let down. I think I'm a little irked with some people who said this movie didn't deserve 5 stars. They are very wrong, great movie, great action, and the end will shock you.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|I gave this two stars instead of one because I may have received the odd lemon.  I love the idea but after charging it once then depleting it by charging my phone twice and tablet once, it stopped working.  I plugged it in and it would flash one led but no matter how long I let it charge it would not recharge.  Fortunately Amazon has a phenomenal return policy.    **Update**  After posting this review I had 2 emails and one phone call from Laptopmate (not sure how they are affiliated with Anker) asking what they could do to help.  That kind of customer service is rare to almost non-existent today.  After I told the rep that I had already returned it she offered to send out a new one at no cost to me to try.  I am giving it an extra star for the customer service alone.  When I receive the replacement I will update my rating to reflect how that one works out for me.    **Update**  Adding one more star.  The unit has held up well and charges pretty quickly.  Reserving one star for capacity.  Given the specs it should charge my phone completely almost 3 times.  I on;y get about half that even with the phone off.  Still a great battery for the price.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I enjoyed the game until at ch 13 it kept closing the app.  I have tried everything including uninstalling and then reinstalling. I had to start all over, but when I got to ch 13 it did it again. I tried contacting the developers, but got no response back. If they fix the problem, I will change my rating.<br /><br />**I am now able to get through the entire game. I don't know if it's because I got the new Kindle Fire HD or if they fixed the problem, but it works on the HD. They game is ok, but ends kind of cheesy. I enjoy hidden objects games and this one was fine.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|This is a cool addictive game, I can not stop playing it, I even got my mom hooked on this game.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Well put together, kept the suspense and intrigue going right to the end. I Never would have guessed the outcome.
B008M34INW|5.0|I really really enjoyed this movie very very much. Mel Gibson gets the gold in this one. Thanks for this.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Didn't think this movie was going to be that good - boy was I wrong! A  real edge of your seat ride!
0307730697|5.0|An unvarnished picture of an imperfect person who did great things with the time he was given.  Inspired me to be a better man.
B005IA9JZO|5.0|I haven't looked at any of the menu features or special features, so I can't really comment on those yet, but this movie is one of my favorite cult classics.  I loved it when we got it on VHS and we watched it over and over and over again as kids.  Great acting, great dialogue, great and memorable moments that are rare to find these days, especially with typical kid or family movies.  Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts and Maggie Smith all provide satiating performances and there is a magic about this movie that draws you in and doesn't let you go until the very end- BUY IT for your family - you won't regret!  It is even more enjoyable watching on blu-ray - fantastic quality of picture that escalates value of the film for me, although I didn't think at first that it would make that much of a difference, it certainly did.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Great mp3 player<br />i used a 2gb sd card filled with songs no problem.<br />sound is so clear no static on the fm stations. this is my second mp3 player.<br />my first was a cheap mp3 player junk, static very unhappy.<br />I am so glad i chose this company they know quality of good sound.<br />good size display.and you can see the song you are playing through your fm radio display.<br />Buy it you won't be sorry
0374532990|5.0|Think ill have to go back and by one for me. This is a Christmas gift. Looks fantastic and great addition to a talk I saw from NY city urban planner.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME, SO THERE FOR THE CD IS AWESOME. WE STILL CANT BELIEVE THAT THE SINGING IS DONE BY TOM CRUISE AND JULIANNE HUFF ALL THEMSELVES. IT IS SO AWESOME TO LISTEN TO AGAIN AND AGAIN, YOU ALMOST FORGET THE GROUP THAT ORIGINALLY SANG THE SONGS, THEY ARE THAT GOOD!
B000B5XOSO|5.0|I had ordered this for my husband for his birthday and he was more than thrilled. He loved the extra documentaries and he loved the movie. A childhood classic for him. It arrived in good time as well.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|I find this game quite entertaining.  It gets harder as you progress in levels.  Give it a try you might like it.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|i enjoyed watching this recap of the first two season. well done - brings in the seriousness and adds comedy as well.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked it as it was something different from the type of book I usually read.  However, I did not like it wll enough to read the triology.
B0029XFN9O|4.0|awesome !! i love it To great for words to complete this required little cool review it was good thanks
0061245097|3.0|It's been four years since the events of Halfway to the Grave. Cat, has honed the skills Bones has taught her, working for a secret government agency as the head of a unit that hunts down troublesome undead.  Her half-vampire heritage offers an invaluable benefit to the cause.  But you don't do what Cat does without making a few enemies.  She's now a target as someone has put a hit out on her.  Her only hope is Bones, the vampire she left behind.  Though he's \\"dead\\" he's the only one on this earth to make her feel alive, and those feelings come rushing back. But can she keep them at bay? Not if he has his way.<br /><br />I am always a little concerned about ships when the characters get together off the bat because I feel they become stale.  Even with the insta-love between these two, I thought the first book was exciting and fresh.  But this one felt like more of the same.  I liked Bones in book 1, but there wasn't a lot of evolution here, so he came off as Gary-Stuish. And Cat, his Mary Sue.  Unlike the first go 'round, I didn't find  the number of times one was jealous, insecure,  or baiting vamps for slaughter to be nearly as amusing.  And then Bones practically always had the answers to the problems so I just didn't find him as intriguing and to be honest, his dialogue started to irritate me a bit with the \\"blokes\\", \\"luvs\\", \\"sods\\" etc. He's over 200 so I wish he would have acquired vocabulary with more variety by now.<br /><br />There was a fair bit of action and definitely some laughs, but Jeaniene Frost doesn't include enough follow through after the build up. I feel like there's this massive world with characters waiting to be explored, but we get less than I want to see in a read. I'm really big on supporting characters, yet I didn't find myself attached to anyone here. Everything just kept working out a little too easily, so nothing was perilous, gripping, or gritty. I felt like it was basically all centered around when these two could get back to shagging.<br /><br />And speaking of which, of course I can't complete a review without my opinion on chapter 32.  It's pretty much the only thing I was asked about or told about, even during Book 1.  To be honest, it wasn't much to write home about for me.  It wasn't bad (none of her scenes are) but the hype surrounding it made my expectations too high, so an underwhelming result was inevitable.  Don't get me wrong, I  certainly have my short list favorites in literature, but this is just not one of them. Sorry! *ducks from flying tomatoes*<br /><br />Overall, it certainly wasn't a bad read, but it just wasn't as good as I was hoping it'd be.  After the first book I thought it would practically inhale this one, reading it in no time, but that just wasn't the case.  There's still Book 3 which I do plan to read, but that will be the final determinant of whether or not I plan to keep going with this series.  Though I like to come to my own conclusions, I've heard that the earlier books are better so I don't know how well that bodes for the rest..<br /><br />And speaking of which, of course I can't complete a review without my opinion on chapter 32.

B000B5XOY8|5.0|The product arrived in great time and my husband loved it. He loved all of the extra features and the movie itself.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I think the acting is pretty bad, and the dialogue leaves something to be desired. But the visuals are good, and the design of the plot is pretty interesting -- I'm sure you can thank its graphic novel heritage for that. I devoured every episode within the span of a week. Each episode leaves you hanging, so you have to keep watching to find out what happens. It's fun, but it's not great.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|of course i'm gonna like this, NO, love it!  easy access to my friends/family on facebook helps a bunch!  thanks
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|&#34;Restless&#34; was my introduction to William Boyd. I chose it because of the mother/daughter theme, which when done well, provides for rich doubling effect. Boyd made the women real, and the mother's story especially was compelling enough for me to finish the book in one read from 2 to 5 a.m. on a sleepless night.  But, then again, I am a sucker for WWII espionage plots involving ordinary people.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Rackateer moves quickly right to the end keeping you in suspense with twists and turns.  As always, a good read.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|An enjoyable read and an interesting collection of characters.  The &#34;Australian&#34; setting was well done and didn't feel touristy.  I enjoyed reading it after having read so many other Nesbo books.
B0058YPL66|5.0|wow.  I just ordered it and about 3 days later came in, brand new and in the package.  Love it!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Before watching this, I was debating whether MacFarlane was a genius.  After watching this, I'm no longer debating the point.  He's not a genius.  Something about the nature of real action, as opposed to cartoons, exposed just how juvenile his humor is.  Not funny.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|ok, it's only a few bucks but i'm not sure why i bought it!  it doesn't do anything that i didn't know my kindle fire did w/o it.  oh well, live & learn.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|We love the movie but could do without all the scary witchcraft junk for sure. The bear scenes are pretty intense for my almost 3year old, we had to turn volume down and close eyes. Sadly it just fuels nightmares.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is one of the best I have read. It's action packed with romance and conflict.  It keeps you on your toes, anticipating what is to come next.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Harry Bosch novels are always good to read.  The plot is somewhat predictable at times but that is OK because it moves at a good pace.
B001992NUQ|5.0|One of the best movies out and you can't beat blue ray right now!! Great twist in the movie!! Product shipped faster than expected as well!!
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I'm not a member of the Wes Anderson bandwagon.  I've seen nearly all of his films, and I've enjoyed all of them.  The Royal Tenenbaums was his magnum opus.  But I would never call them great films.  I like the offbeat, lighthearted feel of them, but they never stand for anything.  I think they explore what it's like to be a moody, cerebral person in an age that lacks a defining conflict or purpose.  That's all well and good, but it's not great.
B009KYQNSA|5.0|looks like Stone is back to having fun with the material ,changing tone like he changes film stock this is bloody good entertainment ,the 3 young leads offer a nice counterbalance to the larger then life veteran 3some led by Del Toro ,Travolta and Hayek. This i think settles in nicely with the underrated U-Turn and the great Natural Born Killers even though all 3 really are quite different also,highly recommended!!!
B007VDN1PA|2.0|It is very small and the film will not feed all the way through without me playing with it.  Not impressed at all.  Would not recommend it to anyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|CAUSE IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ON TV....<br />I HOPE THEY GO ON FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER AND EVER......
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Ranking books are always a good read.  I particularly enjoyed the book as it was set in a part of Scotland where I'd spent a few weeks this year.  The writing is tight and expressive.  The book moves along at a good pace with subtle twists and turns and a variety of interesting characters.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Miracle on 34th Street 91 (1947) is a great movie and well acted and that is why I gave this a 5 star rating. Recommended for all ages.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|It's exceedingly rare to see something this subtle on TV.  This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time.
B000LW7OWE|5.0|Val Kilmer is Jim Morrison in much the way Josh Brolin is George W. Bush in W. except in this movie the production value is off the charts as you are transported back to the 60s through the unique lens of Stone !!
B0049J3QF4|2.0|I don't really like this movie.  It never holds my children's attention for more than a half hour.  I have a 2 year old boy and he doesn't even get into it.  He loves cars but this just doesn't work on him.  I find the movie pretty annoying, myself, compared to other Disney movies.
B009346RSS|4.0|If you are using this with hame audio components, depending on the sensitivity of the line level input on your reciever or pre-amp, if you don't have ability to adjust line level in the pre-amp, you may be better off with DAC that has gain control.  In my case with older Harman Kardon reciever, I have to turn the volume up too high making the amp work to hard and generate to much heat.
B00846F1YW|3.0|Some areas are difficult. But, all in all an enjoyable game. Did not like having to repeat areas over again and not having opportunity to skip a level
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like this app. some of the characters are hard to figure out which match they go with but once you understand that it is a lot of fun.
020530902X|5.0|I have no idea how many copies of this book I've bought over the years - but I never regret spending the $$$ to re-buy! As an author, I don't know how I'd get by without Elements of Style. And most recently, I used it while writing a style guide for a client of mine. If you write for a living or write occasionally for business, make this a MUST HAVE in your library. But don't lose yours as often as I've lost mine.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Movie was exactly what I purchased. Movie had its funny moments but also emotional moments. Very good movie and item came exactly on time.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie is good.  I was pretty riveted by it.  It is a little scary for the smaller set but my kids seemed to not notice and they are 4 and 2.  I did find it perhaps predictable for Pixar.,.maybe could of been more inventive, but the theme of a strong princess who doesn't want the prince, and the focus of the mother daughter relationship was great!  I don't think Merida was portrayed as too bratty really..I mean, kids can be bratty and they do things without realizing the real consequences.  They can be short sited and only think of their wants and needs..I don't think that is bad to show as long as the resolution shows the growth of the character, and their realization to see beyond themselves and have compassion etc etc.  Merida does grow and so does her Mother for that matter.  They clearly love each other but their own preconceived notions and desires get in the way.  I have a very strong willed and feisty daughter and this movie touched me for sure.  It just reminds us that no matter what is going on in our relationship with our children, how furious we get, how furious they get, how many things that are done with haste..we still love each other fiercely and that is always there..sometimes things just get in the way and we must rise above and settle differences.  I think this is an important message to address, and maybe it's an ordinary topic but I'm glad Disney and Pixar addressed it.  It's not a perfect movie but the characters are loveable, esp. the Dad, Merida, the brothers, and the Mom; and the animation is top rate.  Merida's hair animation is reason enough on it's own to watch this movie!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a well written novel with a heartbreaking topic of loss - baby abandonment, poor foster care, willingness to love and risk, and adoption gone awry.  The end brings together the threads, which is satisfying.
B0076DELIG|3.0|A slow start and somewhat confusing. It got much better about a third  of the way through. I really enjoyed it  after that.
B009T3AE1Y|3.0|In the airless world of speculation capital it's fitting that Wall Street wunderkind /billionaire Eric Packer(Pattinson) uses a stretch limo to exert his power and control,a bullet-proof vacuum tube,a space-ship of venture capitalism.Sealed off from the world outside from impregnation,a world of financial breakdown,civilian chaos.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Great lead and supporting characters with an unbelievable yet believable storyline. What if the perfect person for you is perfectly horrible?
B005529BDK|5.0|I have found no problems, very addictive game. Easy to use. It sometimes takes some time to load, but still a great game
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Though this book is not for everyone, it was one of my favorite books of 2012. Angsty college drama -- I couldn't get enough.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|All it says when I open is &quot;Program has unfortunately stopped working&quot; uninstalling and downloading in play store. #Garbage I expected better
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm not an official reviewer. I'm not great at breaking a book down and analyzing every part. But I can tell you this. This book is another great one by Colleen. I didn't think it was possible to live this more than Slammed and Point of Retreat, but I freaking do. I know this is gonna sound corny but this book touched the hell out of me. Like almost to the point of curling up in a fetal position and crying. Read this and you'll understand exactly what I mean. Thank you Colleen.
B0001I561E|5.0|Just like i remember from childhood. Definitely worth getting so your children can experience it! Great deal, especially since Disney has it in the vault for the foreseeable future.
B009CPIR9K|4.0|If you are looking for a movie that could happen - this is not for you. If you like SYFY and you need a fun escape you might like this one. Turn off your brain and enjoy.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I've read all of Tom Clancy's books and my favorites are with Ryan as President, The action is a up to date with our current technology and threats. A well written story and well worth the read.
0300169787|5.0|Savage Beauty is one of the most beautiful fashion books on the market. I've heard there's a follow-up in the works, and I can't wait to see it!! He was so talented -- and I'm sure the photos don't even do those clothes justice.
B001BW02B8|5.0|This album is one of the best from them! The fact that it is unedited is also a plus as it ids hard to find locally in ut like that
B0076DELIG|5.0|As usual Michael Connelly delivers.  Love the Harry Bosch series and look forward to each new one.  For anyone who loves detective stories you'll love Harry.
B003UESJHE|5.0|This is English Film-making at its best. This is a human story, wonderfully shot, superbly acted and of-course, historically based.

B005ZUR724|1.0|come on this game was awesome until people could not log in the amazon store wont freaking get the update please fix this or I'm done
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I wanted to read this book because I had liked Paper Towns by John Green. I had resisted reading the book for awhile just because it seemed to be so popular and the subject matter was depressing. John Green is a good writer (although I am starting to see patterns in his work- currently reading Looking for Alaska). I read Paper Towns within hours as I did with this book. His teenage characters use some vocabulary that I don't even understand as an adult, so I find it a bit hard to believe. This was a sad book. As I expected it to be.

B009R9WAZ8|5.0|I can't even explain how amazing Unapologetic is, Rihanna's reign truly won't let up, she is one of the most consistent and passionate R&B/Pop artists in the game.

B005LLSNNE|4.0|This show is one of my guilty pleasures. The problem is I should feel guilty about watching it but I do not. The writing is fantastic. The actors are outstanding which makes for a phenomenal show.  If you loved shows like, Deadwood, Oz, The Wire, The Sopranos. Then this show will appeal to you. It's about young man who is the son of the founder of a biker club. While attempting to find himself and figure out who he is and his role in the club he learns some secrets about his father, mother and the man he has loved as a father. It's a very interesting take on what occurs in the lives of bikers.    Please check out IMDB and check out the list of amazing cast members.    [...]
B008476HBM|4.0|I read this book in high school and enjoyed is somewhat.  Recently I read it again and was far more impressed.  It gives a great description of the period (19th century) and Austen's character development is wonderful.  There are many lines often quoted today and many miss out because they never read the book.  Her humor is subtle but witty.  It's doesn't have the action of many books today but it is relaxing reading.<br /><br />The Kindle version of the book is good.  It is clear and easy to read with good navigation (for a Kindle).
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|It was a good movie but I do like the other Bourne Movies a little better. However it was still full of action scenes.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed Reflected In You as much as Bared To You! Quick read that is hard to put down!  If you enjoyed the Fifty Shades Trilogy, then this is for you!!  Enjoy!!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|As a children's book, Polar Express is a phenomenal work that everyone enjoys; as a film, it does much the same. The songs, voice talents, and animation truly make the magic translate from Allsburg's pages.
B00795P4EG|5.0|It does a nice job editing, and removing objects. I've used it a few times and it gets easier the more I use it.  Just watch the video it's very informative.<br />I recommend it.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Alright so I am a 70's baby. This show in composes my love of horror and action. This is yet another show that is depicted from a  graphic novel. Which I have never read. Yet I have quickly become a die hard fan. This show is set in an apocalyptic type atmosphere with a some what realistic twist. You find your self wondering how you would survive if you were there and who would you trust. What would you do to keep your family alive.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|one of my favorite disney movies&#34;!  my daughter loved it and we have watched it every day for a week
B00571F26Y|5.0|Dr. Davis's book titled &#34;Wheat Belly: Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back...&#34; is an extremely informative book for anyone trying to sort out the truth from the fiction about a healthy diet.
B00005N6KG|3.0|Perfect in the beginning...........love in ear buds and these light and comfortable..................but one ear stops working and then the other in a short period of time...................make it last longer and charge more!!!!
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Excellent comedy that will entertain teenagers, adults, and elderly :) Definitely a must-see for movie buffs and everyone else! Yay.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Very simple and easy to use!  I would recommend this calculator to anyone.  This calculator offers standard and scientific capability.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A great read. Could not put it down. Isaacson's credibility obviously helped to get all of the characters to open up and tell great stories.
B003Y5USF0|4.0|I actually think that the tornado scene in The Wizard of Oz was the most amazing special effect for a movie of its time.  That said, the special effects in Twister are awfully good.  Not much of a story line, other than people seeing how close they can get to a tornado without getting killed, but still a fun ride.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|The scope of the book is not limited to running. You will find valuable information about human nature, human evolution, how science can do harm and many other unusual thoughts. It gave me courage to push my physical limits and you might benefit the same way not limited to running.<br />4 stars only because it could have been written a bit better, literary wise, but still readable at the moment.
B00973902K|4.0|Not a big pop star fan but this tune is catchy!  This song has really become a favorite of mine.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|A violent, creative cult classic in the noir style that will do much more than entertain. This movie spouts anarchic ideas, but has a Usual Suspects-twist ending!
B004UJAOLM|3.0|LATER EDIT:<br />Read 'The Brothers Karamazov' instead, it's more interesting and revolves around family dynamics in a conceptually (but not necessarily stylistically) similar manner.<br /><br />To make my review concise:<br />This book is about a dysfunctional family and dysfunctional relationships between people - or more accurately, about relationships that revolve around a twisted man. It doesn't do much beyond flesh out those relationships over a span of many years.<br /><br />I suppose this book is interesting. It is well written and definitely has characters (although for the life of me, for some reason, keeping their names and identities straight in my mind was a tiring task that I never really fully accomplished, maybe it's just me). I went into this book hoping for more plot, more story of people's lives, with the dysfunctional family elements pervasive if not along the sidelines. That's just not what it is. It's a potential tenant learning about how twisted a family is from the reminiscent eyes of a previous inhabitant. And that is really all the book is.<br /><br />My review here is obviously not paying attention to the book's classic status. Or the fact that it's free and creative commons, written by a woman during a timeframe where as far as I understand, that wasn't common, lest of all to go on to be considered a classic. Or the fact that the story-inside-a-story concept was novel at the time.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Was very entertaining throughout the book however the ending was a bit predictable although still enjoyable. Lots of violence so only for adults.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I love this show. I'm rewatching the first 4 seasons and they are even better the second time. I just think that the goals of the producer have been exceeded. The style, the storyline, the characters...all compelling and interesting. In every episode. Hope it keeps coming! Oh, and I love the consideration of color, light, and composition. It seems that every detail has been thought of and handled perfectly. PROPS!
B006TTC5JK|5.0|Every generation in my family watches this together.  hilarious yet warm. Jimmy Stewart at his best along with a fabulous cast.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|The price was great and the box set well designed, but I wish the disks had contained some special features.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Love it, best show we own. Jason...Kudos!! Wish we could have been there but this is the next best thing!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Books like this are awesome. No joke, I walked into a bustling, noisy pub on a Friday night and the bouncer was idly sitting there reading his Kindle. When I asked him what he was reading (I'm nosy like that - plus I just love a lotta books), he told me it was a book I'd probably never heard of. Well, color me intrigued; I was baited and interested because that is just my favorite kind of thing! Turns out it was Wool.<br /><br />I first and foremost was impressed that a big (BIG) dude at a goofy Fremont bar was reading a Kindle, and impressed with him that he should be reading something nifty. I came here, took one look at the review breakdown and decided I had to see for myself. (Also, what a value!)<br /><br />Turns out it was completely worth it. I had it in a queue for reading with a few other books in front of it until one day I didn't feel like any of them and opened this one up. I didn't look back; it was, quite possibly one of, if not the, first time a book has grabbed me right away from my real-world tasks and sucked me right along for the ride. I finished book one in one sitting and, despite needing to, couldn't stop without peeking at the next page. Which turned into the next 30.<br /><br />That's pretty much how the whole book went. Once you're into book 3, the story gets a bit less intriguing and it transitions more from a world of curiosity and intrigue (\\"What?!\\") to a world of exploration and fleshing out characters and themes. I could see this getting a bit of flak from someone who really gets going by the mystery and cliffhangered-ness of the early sections, but really, to me, I was already immersed into the story and world. I like how Howey creates a shift between someone we initially perceive as pure evil into more of a necessary approach (makes you think), then at the end takes a real turn with it. Good stuff. I also kind of like that the perspective jumps around. I was pretty invested in some of the happenings in this book (emotionally).<br /><br />If you like exploring worlds in a proper sci-fi setting, DO NOT miss this book. It's great.r />If you like exploring worlds in a proper sci-fi setting, DO NOT miss this book. It's great.
1878424777|5.0|a friend told me to buy this cd...very nice and calming. it makes you stop and think....which is hard in this fast paced world. buy this listen to it and you will agree...its words to live by for sure.
B002BRRTUO|5.0|A Classic must watch for any Science Fiction Fan.  Always a great watch! Sam Jones recent apperance in the movie TED prompted me to watch this movie again.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|Jim Cary does an outstanding job in this retelling of this old classic and never missis a beat on the telling. My new classic for Christmas
B0027MJU00|4.0|but took a star away for the gory details. Some may like that, I don't so much. I wanted to close my eyes at those parts ;)
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I would not reccomend this product. We purchased it for my wifes phone. While I cannot attest to weather it protects the phone or not, I will say that is distorts the sound of the users voice. It sounded like my wife was in the hallway when I was talking to her. It also deters the speakerphone from working. She tried using that and I could not undertand what she was saying. We purchased an otterbox and after it was installed, the phone sounded fine and speaker phone worked again. I would go with the otter box over this ANYDAY. This one might be totally waterproof but the downsides are not worht it at all.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game!!  I can't stop playing it!!  the only problem is that it takes to long to recharge your energy when u don't have money to buy any.  other than that great game
B009NQKPUW|5.0|great movie, different...not same old thing. good filming/effects. Fast moving, not dull, I would watch it again and I don't say that about many movies.
B007SGM084|5.0|I've not read them all but the purchase was super fast & simple! Love Amazon.com! 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very Easy Read.  Did not want to put the books down.  GREAT story. Just wish there was more to come.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is fun because you run a city. i dont. hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi like the paying though2
0060730552|5.0|This high-octane adventure story of three young men (two ambitious mountain climbers)is one of the best in existence.  It has all the thrills and chills you want in an adventure story - plus its nonfiction (always a bonus).  Joe Simpson tells his account with a lot of courage and raw emotion which makes the story a page-turner.  I could read this over and over and never bore of it.  Even if you don't like mountain climbing (I am not a climber) this is an excellent book because its essentially about a person's will to survive against enormous odds.  Its a classic story of man against nature and man against himself.  Buy it.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I was seriously disappointed - The Dark Knight was SUCH a fantastic movie, but this was just a big letdown. Gloomy, depressing and overall extremely boring.  The movie is way too long to keep my interest going, and since the plot was just a big pile of blah I couldn't make it all the way through. I watched about an hour and then called it quits and watched something else.
0915811774|5.0|This series has given me more towards connecting with me than any other... read this but do the exercises because they work!
B0084AXZK0|4.0|The authors style of exploring human emotions , moral ethics and how the reactions to behavior affect consciousness  and actions was fascinating and frightening
B0007CNXUU|5.0|For someone who usually like action or comedy, this was a great movie that fit neither of those categories. Enjoyed the story and characters.
0307592731|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's (Torch, Tiny Beautiful Things: Advice on Love and Life from Dear Sugar) memoir Wild recalls a three month adventure she tackled seventeen years ago on the Pacific Coast Trail hiking from the Mohave Desert through California, Oregon to Washington. While Strayed encounters challenges, mishaps and disconcerting moments on the trail the real adventure is found in her emotional revelations along the way and the slow discovery of her previously lost self.<br /><br />Strayed became inspired to take the journey after reading the back cover of a book while waiting in line at an outdoors store. The author takes-on the trip as a personal pilgrimage and as a far-reaching goal when she is at a desperately low point in her life. Grieving the death of her mother, having split from her husband and using recreational drugs, she plans to hike her way through her confusion. However, her homework of the rigors of the PCT is poor and she is as physically unprepared for the hike as she is emotionally bewildered.<br /><br />Not long into the trek she learns the highs and lows of serious hiking and is witness the frailties and strengths of her own body. Strayed walks with persistent hunger, bloody feet, an aching back (from too heavy a backpack) and fits of extreme loneliness. But slowly her blurred existence starts coming into focus as she begins appreciating the beauty of the trail and the pieces of her shattered life.<br /><br />This is a sometimes dark, and often raw memoir that is uplifting in a soul-searching (and not saccharine) sort of way. It's a rewarding read for any lost adventurer who wants to find their way home again. This is a memoir about the inner and outer challenges of life's journey - and it makes for a gripping adventure and read.<br /><br />Beth Walz<br />AdventureWoman.com
B003L77FYS|5.0|Castle and Becket are the best! They are funny and exciting in your like a police station based comedy. This show is refreshing yet has interesting events happening. There are famous people who make guest appearances, because Castle knows everybody who is anybody. And Castle's mom, well she is great, as Susan Sullivan has always been a favorite of mine from her time working on the soap operas.
B002R5HR70|5.0|Come on... who doesn't love The Bodyguard?  Great movie, timeless.  If you haven't seen it now's the time.  If you have seen it watch it again, it's even better the second time!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this season as much as the first 2!!! I especially love seeing Daryl Dixon step up into a leadership role!
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|This season continued the fun Chuck show. Fun to watch to relax and enjoy some cheesy action. Story continues between episodes, but a single episode picked at random is still enjoyable.
B00866H7SS|5.0|A great read. If you liked 50 Shades, you will love this! I could not put it down. Like 50 the sex scenes are possibly overdone (frequency) but hey, I managed!
B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle and Becket are great as a team. This show is funny and exciting at the same time. Just not sure if getting castle and Becket together will keep the show as funny as it is now. Allowing them to have moments together is funny to see how they cover up their affair, but if they let everyone know about them the intrig will not be the same.
B0083GQVOC|2.0|It's kind of OK, not great. There was so much character development in the book that does not translate to the movie that it was a HUGE disappointment.  If you've read the book (which I HIGHLY recommend!)  don't bother with the movie.  If you haven't read the book, don't bother with the movie just go straight to the book!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I love their story line. I really thought they were going to let some of his story out and the just left you hanging again. It was pretty much a repeat of the first book! :(
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|If you love the film or not, this music is wonderful to listen to in the car or while studying, it inspires greatness :)
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Well written, entertaining and keeps you awake at night as you do not want to put it down! Can't wait for the next one!
0307352145|5.0|This is a wonderful book for an introvert or somebody who knows one, which is probably just about everbody.  Get it and read it please.
B0076DELIG|1.0|I have truly enjoyed Harry Bosch.  But, this novel was put together from current news situations, very low moving and really tedious to read.  I finished it, but, I won't be all that quick to order another Connelly book, again.  Personally, I would suggest you save your money on this one.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book! It kept me reading for hours. The story line was great and it pulls you in!
B0050KTR36|4.0|It's a game and a quiz!  I play it whenever I'm between jobs or waiting in line. I wish they would make more games like this to learn things like what the muscles do (maybe they would say &#34;bicep flexion&#34; and you would have to move the arm in the appropriate direction within a given time?) Great for people who are starting from an anatomical knowledge of zero to one.<br />The only downside is that some of the smaller muscles are too unclear in the pictures because the pictures are so small, so you won't necessarily learn, say, the difference between the flexor digitum minimus vs the flexor digitum minimum brevis and you certainly won't know where any of them insert or what they do.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|this is one of those &#34;he's just not that into you&#34; type of movie with various famous actors and storylines going on all at once. bad bad bad. don't bother
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Always before the NDE could be written away.  Now its proof positive.  That there is more to our lives than what is down here on earth.  The author was very detailed in what happened to him and how much is in the future for all of us.
0345529057|5.0|I love this series, both on Shotime and in book form.  I can't wait for the new season and the new books!
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Realistic and action filled.  Love the actors and the parts they played. John Travolta was great as usual. Great movie the savage
B008TMOIEK|5.0|E L James is 5 stars and this book makes me sigh...  This has never ever been the type of book that I find interesting.  Well, even an old dog can enjoy new tricks!
B002NWOOXW|5.0|Even though i could clearly see he English accent wasn't authentic, i love the storyline and the finish. and who doesn't love Colin Firth
B003XVYLDU|2.0|Slaughterhouse- Five by Kurt Vonnegut,his writing style is unique, it leaves me cold. I am sure I am missing something but cannot identify it.
B007N9FKCY|2.0|It wasn't the game I thought, this is not the kind of game i like to play. that is all
B0042QNP2S|5.0|I bought this truck as a gift, so I have not opened yet, but it looks great and I am very happy with the purchase. I can not wait to open it and see more detail. ;)
B00433SVP6|5.0|This sequel to Percy Jackson topped all my expectations. The story is written so that the new characters introduced seems realistically put in, but at the same time it leaves room to wonder about the main characters of Percy Jackson. This book, this whole series is great, and even if you're worried that a sequel-series will ruin the magic of the first, I can tell you it won't. Heroes of Olympus makes just as good a series as Percy Jackson, and it's definitely worth reading.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen delivers another thoughtful amazing book.  Can't express how much my heart broke for Sky.  A must read in my opinion
B00913P6G0|5.0|Awesome. My only complaint is I wish it fit all on one CD. Including &#34;Westside, Right on Time&#34;  would have been cool.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Camera works..but I have been unable to locate files where pictures are?? also front facing ..take pics of me ?<br />I havn't had time to spend to figure this out yet..maybe will like it later but so far..not impressed.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|Not quite the best Dexter but still awesome. Dexter is my favorite show and season 6 lived up to expectations.
B0033807C2|5.0|This is an amazing end to the series... The way the story goes along means that you're sure you know what's going to happen – and then the story takes a turn, and something unexpected happens. Riordan manages to pull of a satisfying ending, while still leaving enough questions unanswered to be able to make a sequel series. The characters are convincing, the storyline has exactly the right amount of surprise and understanding. All in all, you cannot miss the end of the series, it's simply too good. So if you've read all the others, read this too, the story is too good to let go of.
1419705849|5.0|My son loves this set of Whimpy kid books.  This is the newest one to the series and as soon as he got it out of the box he was reading it.  Fast delivery from seller
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Some of the humor in all of the Toy Story movies is very adult and funny.  I think Hamm, the pig bank is the funniest.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not your normal sci go adventure. Believable, good characters, interesting problems. I had not heard of this author or series and was delighted at the discovery. The female heroine was likeable if imperfect. The idea that mankind would try to save itself by setting up self sustaining colonies on earth credible. Definitely thought provoking
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|AS a stand alone, it is amazing.  Nothing in line with the first season, but the best part.....characters from S1 now get to stretch their acting to new parts, I don't want to spoil anything, but I am finding most everyone! AHS is unlike any horror series out there.  Imagine a VERY well-done scary movie that just goes on and on, never letting you go.  Breaking Bad geos GORY!!!
B005HHSXP0|5.0|Like with all other Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus books, Riordan manages to pull the reader into a universe that's entirely his, while still following rules of others, the Romans and the Greeks. It takes skill to write like that, and to remember every rule, and Riordan has the necessary skill. He's capable of making a story that's entirely his own, with myths that already exists. The book is written with great skill, and the plotline twists so you're never quite sure of what's going to happen next. Riordan does not lower the level of his skill in this seventh book, and if you liked the others, you're going to swallow this as well.
1419702238|5.0|My son loves these books.  From the moment that he opens the box when it comes, he is sitting down and reading it until it is done
B000WP30CI|5.0|This is the most intimate film of Dylan, during his time before he went electric. The on-stage performances were great!
B001QC9PSO|4.0|My grandson loved this movie, he watched it repeatedly....Will have to get this for him for Xmas as a stocking stuffer.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I love it on my kindel fire, and the best part it was free. Great bright  light for emergency or night time.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Once more, Riordan has managed to surprise me with his skill. You have no idea what will happen, but you know it will be good – that much is possible to sense already from the beginning. The book is exciting, and the end leaves plenty of room to think about the next, while also making it impossible not to read the rest. Read it if you've followed Percy and the others throughout all the prequels; it's a book impossible to put down.
B006IYG5HE|1.0|I bought this book after reading a newspaper review that stated Harry Hole was similar to Harry Bosch.  Apparently this reviewer has never read a Michael Connelly book.  The story did not flow easily and I finally abandoned the book, chalking up the experience as another poor decision to try a reviewer's recommendation.  I will stick to my favorite tried-and-true writers.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Just not very entertaining.  Seem to drag.  Not enough interaction between characters.  Good actors, poor story line or directing.  Would not recommend this movie.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|A must watch for Christmas! If you have never seen this movie you will be enchanted. A favorite of mine that I never get tired of watching.
B001794FOK|1.0|This movie looks good but it was not as exciting as it looks on pre-views. Would not recommend anyone to buy it!
B005P5TQPU|3.0|Though I love being able to see the whole season.  I purchased a cable so I can connect my Ipad to the t.v. and watch the episodes that way.  However, the amazon app does not allow that.  Bummer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent series...you never know what is going to happen..or who will die.  I love a show that I can't predict!
B005P06AAO|1.0|I didn't get the package and I didn't get to see it.... I was sooo sad because I was sooo looking forward to watch this video. I'm still trying to find a way for a safe delivery mail because I guess the US. postal service sucks. I never had a problem with them but I this had a problem this time. and It was for this 1 DVD and for season 2. I hope I get my money back so i can buy it again. and actually watch it. :(
159420411X|5.0|One of the advances of the digital age is the creation of a new universe, one of digital data. Nate Silver's book and work examines the most important question: how do we perceive meaning out of the noise to anticipate what will happen.<br /><br />Nate's notion, like all things, is not new. Aristotle hizself in Poetics recognizes the the most important elements of a story are: 1) the action, 2) the characters, and 3) the thought (given the action and characters, what is possible in the future?). Where Aristotle followed a qualitative approach, Silver is a child of his age in harnessing the immense data sources of the digital age in a quantitative-driven approach. That said, Silver appreciates the value of qualitative data and argues that even whiz-bang predictors can fail because they exclude qualitative data.<br /><br />What Nate is doing, in his book and blog, is developing the quantitative side of looking into the future. Ultimately, he's encouraging us to turn around and look into the future.<br /><br />Silver's lenses are statistical, but tempered by context. He correctly maintains that data is meaningless without context. His approach is more than plugging numbers into a mathematical formula to anticipate what will happen.<br /><br />Between us girls, I can't help but feel that our public discourse would be much enhanced if we could peer into the future more intelligently. Too often, I get the feeling we extrapolate past events in a straight line, or other pattern, when we gaze into the future. In other words, we tend to have our back to the future while we gaze into the past.<br /><br />What Silver explores is an alternative to backing into the future.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book made me laugh, cry, aroused, and made me feel hope. I loved everything about it. Everything but the ending... however, I suppose it's great too in regards to the fact there is a sequel. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a bone chilling thrilling love story.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The author's description of how the slavery issue evolved over the critical 1850-1865 period was fascinating especially when viewed through a contemporary lens. How Lincoln surrounded himself with strong individuals who effectively covered his weaknesses is a great lesson in management especially during crisis. It is a great read especially after seeing Lincoln the movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better. I honestly cannot wait 'til February to watch the rest of this season.
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|I ended up buying the movie - recommended!! Better camera work than the previous Bourne movies as well. Above average action movie.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I marvel at the evolution of Clancy's writings.  From cold war to terrorism and now to cyberterrorism, they are all very engaging.  I've read all of the Jack Ryan series and this is ,,,one of the best.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Reacher just wasn't as raw and powerful in this book as in the previous books. The book wasn't bad. It just didn't have the same impact on me as the others.
B005HSL626|5.0|AWSOME game ever!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Other people should play this game<br />I recemonded it for the  people who are new to this
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it but wished there was other Solitaire games that was a little more challegeing.Need to look to see just what they have.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|It's fun and kinda hard to control witch I like and I guess it could be I'm not used to it also and I love the f-16 fighting  falcon but I wish it had multiplayer
B0017O1MIM|5.0|I have discovered this film... 45 years ago as a kid... I have always been a fan of it... For profesionnal reasons I went to Jordan and I went in the Wadi Rum... I spent a full night watching the film and all featurettes... I wish now to see it on a big screen a re release in the cinemas could be great. I really recommend to all Hollywood fans to buy this set. And not only for Peter O'Toole the great Omar Sharif has such a great role in this feature film. A definite must for all great cinema lovers...
B008EKON56|3.0|This product works just as suggested.<br />But! Took my head off the first time I tried to use it with a headphone!  Unbearably LOUD!<br />No mention at all in the description that it totally negates all volume control from music player, both physical buttons and software controls.  MUST get an external volume control to use this unit.  I ordered Shure in-line volume control kit that is supposed to have high resistance to handle loud outputs.  Concurrent mini-usb charge and audio out worked.  Increased my total cost to $25 from $9.
B007HACDLK|3.0|This is the same type of plot you get with all CIA novel's.  Iknew the ending after the first few chapters.  It was entertaining, fast and easy to read.
B00AH8U3UC|3.0|It was sometimes blurry but other then that was good.  I would recommend it to anyone who asked me if it was worth buying.
B009HEJXFS|1.0|Don't waste your time. Talk about a paycheck movie... badly written, badly acted and just nowhere near the original. Glad I didn't spend $$ to go see this in the theater.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Fastest chip I ever bought and good power conservation.  Its an Intel and never seen one go out on me.  Recommended.
B009VB97EY|1.0|The only reason I didn't give this 0 stars is that option wasn't available. I love Matthew McConaughey but I was disgusted by the character he played in this video. The movie very much reminded me of a bunch of guys at a bachelor party videotaping the debauchery.  Sad. Could have been an enjoyable Chick Flick.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As always Tom Clancy develops a plot with current themes, while continuing to develop characters we have gotten to know from previous novels.  And interestingly enough I look forward to seeing many of his the current events brought out in this book to be seen in the newspapers and on televsion news broadcasts.  Tom Clancy has done this before and he continues to do this with his latest book.
B0085YNML2|3.0|Basic and fun. Only thing I don't like is that there are 100 other games just like this out there in the app store.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It's a pity. This story has some depth and the effects are original, but compared to the power of The Dark Knight's script and the character portrayals in both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, this is a weak effort. I will say this, however: Tom Hardy threw everything he had into Bane, and became the best thing in this film.
030758836X|4.0|This book is a fast read, has can't put it down style, sophisticated plotting, and addicting language.  In addition, the F word appears probably 50 times in this book.  It says something about the author.  She must be a very angry person to write this book, to expose both genders' critical attitudes about their partner,and to present two such unlikeable characters. I am tossed between recommending this to friends and not mentioning a word about it because of the language and bitter feelings of both parties. The two characters seem to have no valid reason for their initial attraction to each other, sort of selfish narcissistic reasons. I notice most people are disappointed by the ending.  I guess I can see their point, but won't add a spoiler. Mostly, I was disappointed in the 2 main characters, husband and wife.  They deserve each other!
B0092C2X7U|4.0|I usually check the free app of the day but rarely download to my android devices.  I saw this app and decided to pass on it until I saw a friend playing.  It looked surprisingly fun so I downloaded it to give it a try.<br /><br />It is a bit difficult to get used to and there is a lack of documentation in app as far as directions go, but the game is still fun nonetheless.  I don't think I would have payed for it, but as the free app of the day it was great!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I love the chemistry and wit and humour between Robert Downey Jr. & Jude Law. You get the feeling they are longtime friends as they seem so natural. It really make the movie worth seeing.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|No adjustments but the height and the angle are just right for a desktop. No flimsy plastic, the aluminum frame is sturdy enough for passionate typing, but you would do better to get a separate keyboard you can keep at the proper height while you sit up straight and look at the eye level screen.  I also like the open minimal design, it keeps the laptop well cooled and almost disappears, the laptop just floats over the desk, so it's easy to manage your cables and cords and you have room to keep things underneath.
B006OOHYIC|3.0|I wanted something to play at night to relax. I don't find this game relaxing at all. I don't play it much anymore.
0156014041|3.0|I had never read The Little Prince in any language before this. I can't imagine why it's so popular. I guess it's because it presents many people a dreamy escape from reality? But let somebody else judge the literary merits of the story itself. I bought it primarily because I wanted something easy to read in Latin. The Latin part of it is fine. I read it with relative ease.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best remake of the Batman saga. I really got very interested in it. It might be due to the high caliber of actors. I highly recommend it for all to see.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great engrossing game! Looking forward to a sequel! I love hidden object games and this one has excellent graphics and an interesting storyline.
B0096HID5M|5.0|Just some great singing voices from top rate stars. Great music! The story line is a romance and a fight for what's yours to keep alive.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Watched it twice the same day it came in! then ordered a 2nd copy to give someone else for Christmas!
B008AX1HD8|5.0|This is the reason I keep reading Jo Nesbo: genuinely scary and with that great Scandinavian darkness and chill factor: I have come to really 'know' Harry and can find myself getting angry with him when he falls from grace: a great read in that style
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I am always having to read pdfs and this little app opens them perfectly on my Fire HD. I haven't had a problem and I use it often.
0143119680|3.0|The premise of a Discovery of Witches is fantastic and I expected a great book.  Parts of the book - the history and most of \\"magic\\" - were fantastic.  Unfortunately, most of the book reads like a cheap romance novel.  The romance is completely unbelievable and frankly a bit frightening.  Diana is stalked by a vampire and it turns out they fall in love.  He is possive and protective to the point that it made me uncomfortable reading.  Diana goes from a strong, independent woman to a clingy 12-year old who can barely think for herself and needs to be protected.<br /><br />This book would have benefited from a good editor.  Most of the \\"romance\\" could have been edited - get rid of trite lines like \\"I will never let go of your hand!\\"  Some of the vampire's history was more historical name-dropping than useful to the storyline.  By the end of the book, I still was intrigued by the mystery part, but found the main characters typical 'Mary Sue\\" and \\"Gary Stu\\" characters.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|I did not think there would be a movie so bad and tasteless that I would turn it off after 20 minutes but Ted is that movie. Does not rate one star but must enter at least one to review.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I was worried about the movie since I was used to seeing Matt in the lead role but Don't worry it's an awesome movie.  The story and the suspense was great, couldn't leave the room without pausing it so I didn't miss anything.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This works just fine for me on my Fire HD...Looks great and sounds great...no problems. It has the standard indices and they open right up. I have many, many news apps and this one is reliable and a great addition to my news apps.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game has lots of blocks and monsters in it its fun because you can do lots of awesome things
0876852630|3.0|This is a surprisingly interesting story of the authors young alter ego's travels as a young drunk.  He moves back and forth across the country, finding new jobs and quitting them when they get in the way of his drinking, schmoozes women everywhere he goes, and basically adds nothing to society.  Reminds me of Henry Miller's Tropic of ... books, but Bukowski doesn't come off as such a self absorbed jerk as much as someone just completely lacking ambition.  Much easier to read too.
B009GESJH2|5.0|The CD is awesome.  Music, Lyrics and of course Kid Rock's style make it another winner for him.  Good solid tunes and no bad tracks on the CD at all.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This little app works great and is better than some of the others because you can combine many sound options together to create your special, custom \\"sound.\\" Some of the other ambience apps will only combine 3 sounds together. This one is a better choice. I have combined several sound options which I play at night: rain, wind, melody, heartbeat and windchimes. You can make many others! The only thing I can complain about is the lack of a \\"frog\\" sound. I love frogs!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Book was a bit too repetitive. Took too long to get to the good part. Not entirely satisfied with it.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Great tunes from beginning to end.  If you like Ho Hey, which is what attracted me to the album, I think you will like the rest.
B000L212HC|5.0|I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it and it still seems that every time I watch it I pick up on something new.  The twists in it are so awesome that you just don't see it till it happens.  I've recommended this movie to all my friends and haven't heard one complaint.  Highly recommend it.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I have been a fan of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons for many years!  I enjoy listening to all of their hits because I can understand all of the lyrics!  Something today's music (If you want to call it music!) does not do.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Entertaining read.  If you enjoyed Harry Bosch in his previous exploits, this will not disappoint. True to form, and a continuation of the last book.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Hot sex scenes, love mixed with a mystery If you like to dream and spent some nights with a book- Go ahead just buy!
075669812X|4.0|My grandson loves all things Ninjago.  I think this will be a hit for Christmas.  We've done the sticker book together so this will be some additional bed-time discussion and explanation from him.
B007XF0X16|3.0|This follow-up to 2010's \\"Clash of the Titans\\" disappointed at the domestic box office and with critics so I suspect everyone has their minds made up.  I realize I'm a little late to the party but I'll do my best to defend the film.  I did see \\"Clash\\" and thought it was just OK but the 3-D was terrible.  I didn't have the 3-D option here, but otherwise it is pretty much the same.  One nice thing with this version is there are fewer Greek gods to follow.  Perseus (Sam Worthington) is the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) and a human mother.<br /><br />He is asked by old dad to help stop the destruction of the world caused by fewer gods (and fewer prayers!) and an attempt by kin to resurrect Perseus evil granddad Cronus, the father of Zeus.  Perseus refuses, content to fish with his son instead.  Hades (Ralph Fiennes), the brother of Zeus, and Ares (Edgar Ramirez), son of Zeus and half bro of Perseus, attempt to drain power from Zeus to help free Cronus from his century's old captivity deep inside their mountain home.<br /><br />Perseus, of course, has a change of heart and agrees to free dad with help from a cousin (Toby Kebbell) who is also a half-breed cast-off and yummy Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike).  There is enough interaction between fathers and sons and intra-family squabling that many will feel right at home.  \\"Wrath\\" has plenty of creatures, bombs, explosions, fire and fist-fights as you would expect.  The CGI is pretty effective although one is always amazed at how these characters are constantly thrown against rocks, thrown off cliffs and come away not only unfazed but un-bloodied.  There's not much to recommend, but as long as you just ignore the stupid dialog, the movie goes by pretty quickly.  And of course there is Rosamund Pike.<br /><br />As is often the case, the audio and video of this Blu ray disc far outsurpasses the film itself.  The transfer comes in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The colors are vibrant and the shots feel almost like you're inside a video game.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option which is as good as it gets.  I suspect this has something to do with how immersed I often found myself in such an inconsequential film.  The soundtrack is awash in sound coming from every angle.  This is especially noticeable during the big action scenes of which there are plenty.e a video game.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|It only seems to get better and better!  This season had a few surprises, was intense and the story line was quite good!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There is nothing more satisfying then seeing the skull of the undead being split open in millions of way. If you love anything that has to do with zombies or horror movies, it without a doubt you love this TV series
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Well this was a pleasant surprise!  I'm certainly not the type to be reading Zombie books but this isn't really a Zombie book... It's about humanity and a social commentary on what could happen to our world if some apocalyptic event befell our planet.  Brilliantly researched - I love the international references and the fact that it's not too &#34;Americanized&#34;.  My home town, Cape Town even has a significant role in the story!
B001DSNFZA|5.0|First off, adding to the chorus of positive reviews for this album would be an exercise in futility. It is THAT good!<br /><br />For customers ordering the vinyl record, be prepared to have a few ticks and and other quirks, which can be distracting. They simply don't press vinyl as well as they used to, but it's still a decent purchase.
B009EELNTK|5.0|It has been our tradition to watch this.  It was and still remains an awesome movie that touches ones spirit.<br />This is for my kindle fire HD and it was a very clear movie and sounded great.  You have to buy it to believe the quality you will get.  I am so glad I got this and with my christmas present early, the kindle fire HD it was amazing.  Now time to wrap it up and act surprised.
0071762345|5.0|This book has helped me to be even more interested in this field as it proves how huge it is for companies. The real-life examples and the introduction of the chapters are the best part as they help you to picture all the advices. To sum up, I think this book is a must to understand the importance of engaging instead of selling.
B000T433CO|5.0|Enjoyed over and over again every year.  Thought it was time to purchase the movie, since I love it so much.
B006IDG2T6|2.0|Unfortuntely I purchased this as a printed book,based on reviews. Not convincing at all. A book which uses the author's own arguments to support his claims. Not worth the (very poor) paper it was printed on. It will not be given as the gift for which it was intended.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Good premise, could have been much better, lots of funny scenes, some not so much , sure to be a sequel.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Excellent series. Read it for a book club choice. Then had to read all 3 of series! Like I said excellent
B005HSL626|5.0|I played with my grandchildren ages 5-11 and they enjoyed the competition among themselves to better their scores.  It is a great tool for foscusing!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Believable characters, tight plot, couldn't put it down.  I'm anxious to know what happens after this one.  When is the next one?
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I did not like the bong sene and some of the lanquage as not to good..<br /> Other wise it was intertaining..
B004LWZWGA|5.0|this is a great movie and has a fantastic ending. It is worth having especially if you have the first two.  Completes the set.
B008K6DU4Y|4.0|The app works as advertised. Does what I need it to do.  Only problem is that it seems to run down the battery quicker even when I am not playing videos my remedy is to uninstall the app and just bring it back when I want it. Works for me.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Great packing.  Great movie.  We love it so much.  Thanks for the hard work put in to packing the time!
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Great movie! Action packed. Jeremy Renner was a AWESOME pick!!! He was good in Mission Impossible hope he takes over that one also.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is so much fun. I enjoy playing it again and again. Sometimes I have to restore my kindle to default settings, but I don't mind starting the game again, it's that enjoyable.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Great magic system and cool characters.<br /><br />The story takes place in the same world as ELANTRIS, though in a very different region, with only a few ties to ELANTRIS. So you definitely don't have to have read ELANTRIS to appreciate it.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Great packing.  Great movie.  We love it so much.  Thanks for the hard work put in to packing the time!
B001ED7C58|5.0|Often times there are music tracks on the soundtrack that one doesn't recognise but every song was loud and clear on the CD- My Twilight fan loves it
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|What can I say but this is great it has lots of challenges and levels. There isn't anything bad to say is as addictive as any of the other angry birds. I love it and love to play it, I hope they keep new angry birds coming. It can be frustrating but  thats one of the best things about angry birds. Can't wait for another new version!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Rebus is the quintessence of a determined loner who solves what others can't. My favourite crime novel character of all time!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Great packing.  Great movie.  We love it so much.  Thanks for the hard work put in to packing the time!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Another awesome CD- we have all of hers and the kids sing her songs all the time...love the role model she is as well...the image and peson and the music all match which is sooo refreshing to see
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I thought it might be fun to try a different app not a game but this is just dumb it has no purpose the characters are ugly they make some kind of noise that is really annoying, it is not fun to use it, I can't wait to remove it from my kindle!!! I cannot think of anyone who would like this awful app. It serves no purpose it should not be available at all. The only good thing is it's free.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  When I saw Amazon had it availbale in blue-ray, and my recent purchase of a blu-ray palyer for my bedroom tv, I couldn't resist buying it for my collection.  eh
B0034G4P8A|1.0|Every tab on the inside of this movie was broken off and it looks like someone just shook it for hours straight. It is watchable, but skips.. Very disappointed.
B0096YD3AK|4.0|This album has alot of his signature songs, and the setting in NYC is spectacular, seems anything Paul does is very good.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would recommend this book for anyone who has ever pondered the question &#34;What happens when we die?&#34;  The author's account goes beyond those of most people who have had near death experiences.  Alexander's background as a neurosurgeon lends credence to the existence of an eternal soul and the fact that human consciousness exists apart from the functioning of the brain.  I found his description of The Creator and hosts of angelic, more advanced spiritual beings fascinating!
B00448SE4S|5.0|For anyone who has read the comics, this film is for you. If not, it is still a fantastic movie. The direction is far beyond anything I've seen with creative characters, unexpected foreshadowing, and incredible graphics. I really enjoyed it and I will for years to come.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Great packing.  Great movie.  We love it so much.  Thanks for the hard work put in to packing the time!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Compared to Angry Birds its just too complicated.  No help screen available. Angry Birds consumes too much of my time but its fun.
B009GED3HS|5.0|If you love this show then you'll love this season. Everything starts to come together with every episode. Really like how amazon has the new episodes up so quick at such a cheap price per episode.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|on my kindle I have a hard time but on my girlfriend ipad it's better all the way around :(
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great packing.  Great movie.  We love it so much.  Thanks for the hard work put in to packing the time!
B003V4SF0O|5.0|I found this artist on Pandora and really liked his music.  I have enjoyed listening to him and am happy that I purchased this collection.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|it's an okay game. it's not something i would play all the time but i play it when im bored or if i don't have wi-fi.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitare works well, I have played other version with out commericals that work as well.  Occasionally it would not complete itself when I had all the cards out.
B001EN71CW|4.0|Great packing.  Great movie.  We love it so much.  Thanks for the hard work put in to packing the time!
B003TOMAPC|1.0|So many people say they love this movie, and I don't understand it. While I get the message and think it had a good storyline, I find the humour a bit juvenile and found this movie very hard to get into. It definitely seems like a movie geared towards teenagers.
B00979CS50|2.0|Love Neil and all his incarnations.  I'm critical when something is not good and will praise when I believe it is quality.<br />This album for starters has a few too many long songs.  Its all one note as he said in about 1996 and in this case its true and tired.<br />there is nothing really creative about this album that rings of true Crazy Horse to me.  No Rust, Zuma  or most recently Greendale.<br />This sounds like Broken Arrow from 1996 which was just as tiresome.  Its sounds as if it was slapped together because he wanted to do somehthing with them and threw some tunes together.  I'm waiting for songs he had written back in the 70's to surface like Interstate & Grey Riders.  Those are quality songs and if played today by the band would embody what they are. This is a group of 60+ year olds playing but not anything really meaningful.  When Greendale came out I thought it was awesome, fresh sounding and well crafted. Songs like Be the rain and Devils Sidewalk were unique and rank up there with their other classics.  there is not one classic on PP. Neil is capable of better song selections than this, but I know he does it for Neil and not anyone else.  If he is happy with it that is what matters, but as a fan I'm disappointed.  I know there is better music in there after 50 years of doing it.<br />Update 1-28-13****** The latestet Van Halen album, A Different kind of truth. is much better than PP. Although Tattoo is a terrible song, but several others are very good.  My faves are Blood & Fire and Your Blues.  two rockin tunes that show they still have good hooks and music in them.  Neil please have Joel Bernstein dig back into the archives from 1976 and pull out a few demos that are not released.
B00993FEUK|5.0|The movie is a great buy for all you get. It is good picture quality, & the movie is cute. Great for kids.
B004LWZW7O|3.0|Good movie as I knew but the disc wasn't connected to the tabs in the inside so it has some scratches on it.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|as usual, good episodes, good extras, wish there were other shows this good on TV, hope it gets another 7 seasons +
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Beautiful clothing, incredible intrigue, protocol heavy life, so much that could never be said. A fascinating glimpse into times that have not so distantly passed away.  I recommend it highly.
B008NEMPTO|3.0|Not very good acting.  I guess I should have expected that.  3D was nice, some scenes were excellent. Therefore I gave it three stars.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Great easy read. Makes ya think about how precious life really is. Parallels 3 lives with an intriquing narration. Page turner
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|Great music !! Frank ocean redefines soulful, heart warming tunes. Swim good, novocaine and thinking 'bout you rock this CD.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I am a big Harry Bosch fan, but I had to give this one only a four because I figured it out way before they end and you have to definitely suspend disbelief to accept the ending.  It isn't a spoiler to say Harry survives, it is just a little more improbable this time how he does.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book held my interest throughout. If you want a good page turner you will like this. A little scary in the light of Sandy Hook events.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Finally an easy calculator app. I wish my smartphone had this app. Im awful at math so i forsee this becoming a fav.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great movie, I got the SD streaming version and it looked great, no buffering or anything. I highly recommend it.
B005SCSL56|5.0|This book is full of thrilling adventures. It makes my head bubble with ideas. It makes me feel like I'm in the book.<br />Sasha and Isabelle (9 and 7)
B0031Q0XCA|3.0|Purchased as gift for my daughter. She keeps raving about this movie. So... finally I check Amazon and, of course, they had it available. Received in a very short time and just in time to be a great stocking stuffer.<br /><br />Can't give a review on movie, yet. But, plan to watch over the Christmas holiday.<br /><br />Happy Customer
0753801728|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a choice that my book club made.  It had a lot of interesting discussion points.
B00993FEUK|5.0|This movie is a BEAUTIFUL example of animation, especially stop motion animation, of the highest quality; a true work of art.<br /><br />I am sad to see so many parents rating this film poorly for \\"inappropriate material\\". This movie has some of the BEST MATERIAL you should be teaching your kids! For one: There are no purely evil characters. There are characters who made bad choices, and feel regret. Too many films, especially film for children, paint humans as \\"purely good\\" or \\"purely evil\\" which only teaches them to judge their peers and elders harshly. This is a film which teaches children empathy towards their fellow humans. I recommend it wholeheartedly.
B0026KX5PO|3.0|Great cast and a wonderful setting.  A bit improbable of a plot.  I never read the book, but my guess is the characters were more believable and their motives more developed.  Overall though, I found it entertaining.
B00881VLCE|4.0|fun and easy to use just wish they had some better free puzzles. this is a really really nice free app.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I expected this movie to be hilarious, and while I laughed in parts, it was juvenile and surprisingly unfunny. I actually like raunchy humor... well... funny raunchiness. I had expectations for Ted, and maybe that is why I was disappointed, but in general, I felt like it was a waste of time and money.
1452111014|5.0|This book is GREAT for any animation enthusiast and art book collector. It is exactly how a film art book should be. It covers designs of everything, every character, every environment, and even the stuff which didn't make it into the film!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a really cute movie.  The family and I enjoyed it very much.....we would definitely recommend it.  = }
B009FZFONO|5.0|We don't have AMC service so we decided to buy the season on Amazon prime. We really enjoy it, still get to watch it in HD on our TV through our computer. Really good quality on Amazon.
B00ANT6OK8|5.0|Hey wait a minute it's not in 3-D?  'Zero Dark' should be up for oscar consideration for Best Picture coming next Academy Awards. A few great lines in this movie I can't repeat on Amazon. It kind of falls into 'Scarface (1982) F catergory'. Nothing seem to be sugar-coated or glorfied, straight to the point, spear-headed leading to the capture. Director Bigolow makes the audience feel as if they are inside the raid itself. Zero Dark Thirty is one the years best films and even best of the decade.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I don't like as much as angry birds but still fun.  Takes a bit more thought to complete the levels.
B0026772N8|5.0|It took me 10 months to read and digest this book but this is a very rewarding spiritual journey - it's not the easiest read, I could not read it big chunks at once, I had to progress slowly but in the end I was completely satisfied with where this book has gotten me....
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Quick and easy - I liked this book. The characters were likeable and had a great sense of humor. Wish it didn't end so soon as I would have liked to read more!
0312576463|4.0|Franzen is one of America's great writers. A gold word smith if you will. if only he could create a story that wasn't so TVish.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I thought I'd give this a try but I removed it after playing it a couple times.  It wasn't good enough for me to want to keep.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's a good book, easy to read, and closes the series well enough.  Other reviews were pretty down on it, but I thought it was really good.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This film show cases our Navy and some of it's toys in a challenge from another world. Great acting and plot connecting the game &#34;Battleship&#34; with real world senarios. Interesting battle strategies as well. I was also great to see the inclusion of veterans.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|With the language written for another time period I had to read it slow but I enjoyed it once I got the hand of the writing style.  Now one of my favorites.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I actually got this for my boyfriend to play and he really enjoys it.  I still prefer the original and seasons.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|Awesome
B009G78EE2|5.0|I can't remember the last time I bought an entire CD and loved every single track. With the ability to buy single tracks these days why waste the money on an entire CD when very few are of high quality. You can tell that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis put a lot of love and energy into every single track on this album. I generally don't like rap but I can't get enough of these guys. Also, if they tour your area I highly recommend checking them out live if they don't sell out immediately. They put on an incredible live performance too.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|If you liked the last 2 movies, youwont be dissapointed with the Dark Knight Rises! Wish it wasnt over but all good things do.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I went with this one based on a friend's suggestion.  I love it and I love that this one has the wrist straps for those with smaller wrists.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is absolutely wonderful!  A little demented, but awesome if you like psychological thrillers.  There are more twists and turns than expected but all get pulled together in the end.  I would suggest watching all the episodes in one sitting!  I hate having to wait for the next episode to come out!
B00006RINF|5.0|I got it on time and I'm more than happy with the condition it was in. Also helps that it's a great CD from a great band
B009KKLQVS|1.0|I Googled up a trailer of this concert, and its extremely obvious they are lip synching the vocals.  There oughta be a law against this kind of fraud, not only with video, but with live concerts as well.  It should be required that tickets and videos be plainly marked if pre-recorded music or vocals are involved.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think this might be a good game, but seriously, I won't buy it till I see a demo. 7$ is a lot to pay for an app but it might be justified by having a demo and proving It's good.
0765365278|4.0|\\"While I was writing my current novel - [[ASIN:B00AM6GY98 The Chronicles of Good and Evil - Dracula's Lair (The Chronicles Series)]]\\", I was conscious of the fact that while I was not imitating them......I would be compared to J.R.R. Tolkien and George R.R. Martin. However Brandon Sanderson's epic qualities and inventive flair for plotlines might also draw comparisons... Since I am reviewing the entire series, I won't speak to any specifics, but to the entirety of the trilogy. In summary, Sanderson gets high tribute for his originality, in-depth plotlines, deep/riveting characters, and understanding of the fantasy world he has so ably created.<br /><br />I quickly found myself caught up in his enjoyable writing style (especially with the first book), the immersion of his main character, the quality display of the prime conflict between heroines and the evil lord. And with the battle scenes. Which I found acutely conceived and fun to read. Many of the main characters were well-developed. As to the secondary characters, I felt they were more artfully done in the two final volumes to the trilogy.<br /><br />I took me a bit to get used to a world made of ash, but once there, the storylines, the action/adventures style swept me through. If you are a fan of fantasy, then you won't be disappointed in this well-thought out trilogy...<br /><br />C. David Murphy
6305754969|5.0|Item was a Christmas gift and ideal for any John Wayne or Cowboy movie fan. Highly recommended and Great experience.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I can understand why Matt Damon didn't want to make a movie with this director. Even though they tried to weave the plot into the first three movies it just doesn't work in my opinion. The majority of the time it felt plodding and disjointed. Jeremy Renner was adequate in the roll, but as much as I like Rachel Weisz her character and portrayal was simply annoying. I'm not sure which was worse, Tony Gilroy's screenplay or his directing. And to top it off Amazon charged a dollar more than usual for the HD version of this rental. I felt like it was a waste of time and money.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a really good read. Both the author's life experiences and the &#34;near death&#34; experiences satisfied an interest I have in LIFE!
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|Wonderful analogies to help visualise the concepts. A thought provoking read. Its best read little bits at a time. A book you will return to over and over.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun game. I've been playing for 25 days straight. It gives you the opportunity to win acorns instead of having to buy them. Nice.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|As a family movie I thought it was alright but my son absolutely loved it. We watched it daily for days and he still isn't tired of it.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I remember Pentatonix name from seeing one episode of one of the television singing shows a while back so I decided to listen to the clips and I really liked their sound.<br /><br />I would describe Pentatonix as young, hip, and fresh. My taste in Christmas music tends to lean towards Mannheim Steamroller, TSO, some Whitney Houston (especially with full choir vocals) and Straight No Chaser. Pentatonix can go on random play with all of the above and blend right it. I am thrilled with them and look forward to buying everything that they have released.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Yahoo Strikes again. They totally ripped off Facebook UI.<br /><br />now when I switch between accounts the number of touches to get to the inbox is just stupid and there is no default folder when switching.<br /><br />there is no way to re position the \\"accounts\\" link in the user navigation pane (the part they ripped off from facebook).  When you have a lot of folders created for an account you have to scroll down to the bottom to get to the \\"account\\" link.<br /><br />Everytime I go to the MANAGE ACCOUNTS page, the f'n Sync box is checked.  If I want it unchecked IT SHOULD STAY UNCHECKED!!!!<br /><br />the actual UI once you are in a folder is okay.  manipulating emails to trash, spam, etc is good. EXCEPT for the check for new email by pulling down the first email at the top.  lame.<br /><br />How to set the default email account when I click on \\"reply to\\" in some other app?<br /><br />the inclusion of only a few settings that can be changed by the user is ridiculous too.<br /><br />i have been a member of Yahoo since there was Yahoo.  This app is not well done.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|I love it and listened songs over and over again. The price is very good for this Album. I am pleasantly surprised.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Slow in the start but then pick up and is worth every min.leave off for second movie and lot of stuff from the video game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book had a great twist and was always suspenseful. You should try this book and the other books not the series
B003DNN0L2|5.0|My family loves this movie!  We enjoy everything about it-the voice actors, the animation and of course the story.  Wes Anderson did a fabulous job and made a very clever telling of the classic story!
0385536828|5.0|If you are a fan of Ian McEwan, this latest novel will not disappoint! Beautifully written and always 'smart'! Brilliant!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I like the author and up to this point he has kept me guessing until the end.  But this one I had figured out pretty much a little way into it.  Sure enough, the end was what I expected.  And it took forever to get to that point.  If you are following the &#34;John Corey&#34; character, you should read it.  It is entertaining to that extent.  It definately needed a little more action though through the beginning and middle.
1608871517|5.0|This is a great book for Mj fans and also fashion design students.<br />It shows the developing relationship between Michael Bush and Michael Jackson over 25 years.  How MJ tested him by throwing cherries at him at the first meeting and seeing his reaction.  This was to see if Michael Bush was alright with his, MJ's pranks.  The book also shows the development of MJ's costumes over time and Michael Bush's genius at altering costumes to suit Mj's show, such as the Levi 501 jeans being picked apart and spandex sewn into the seams, so Mj had more movement on stage while dancing.  Who would have known this.<br />I was actually surprised at the detail in the jackets and I can only say how sumptious the designs were.  Obviously as someone who was not around Michael Jackson I would not have known of the detail in some of his jackets.  The pictures in the book show this.  Some of  the Bush/Tompkins designs were truly something else.  Although the press liked to portray Michael Jackson as some half wit, this cannot be so as the people he chose to work around him were talented and Michael Jackson knew how to get the best out of them, especially in this relationship.<br />Michael Bush works through this relationship from their first meeting, designing clothes for various tours and going on tour with Michael Jackson, dressing him for the 2005 trial, some of the costumes for This Is IT and dressing him for his burial.  The book is supported by many pictures detailing the many costumes and even knights costumes that were made for MJ by them.  It is a real peek into the creativity of Michael Jackson and Bush/Tompkins.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|Could play it for hours and then start all over again when I'm done. Fun and addicting game, absolutely worth the money.
0345803485|1.0|This book was an awful read...actually it was torture to get through it.  The only reason I kept reading it was because I bought it and was determined to see what all the &#34;hype&#34; was about.  Turns out it was a huge disappointment and I am embarassed to say that I was reading it.<br />I would NOT recommend this book to anyone!!!
B000S1L7IU|3.0|This the worst book I have read from Clive Cussler as all the action was in the last few pages. This not the normal way he writes his books. Is he running out of ideas?
B009A9EPLM|5.0|You can listen to the samples before you buy, but this is quintessential Americana. It reminds me strongly of music by Copland. Just like everything else that John Williams has composed this music fully transports you to the time and place of the movie. I highly recommend the album.
1451638450|5.0|I have long wanted to see a story told completly from Ivan's point of view: this book delivers! I hope Lois writes forever, I'll read anything she creates!
B0098VXE50|4.0|Critics claim that this movie was too violent.  Those critics obviously never read the original Snow White written by the Grimms.<br /><br />The story is about beauty, vanity, good, evil and compassion.  The beauty in the story was more of a metaphor for the beauty that resides within.<br /><br />Sadly today critics of this movie missed this.  Also, when the original story was written people were not concerned about being politically correct and understood the moral to the story.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I've been following Bruno Mars since 2010 and I have to say that his current album is excellent! He is so talented unlike a lot of the singers out today. Every song on Bruno's latest album could be a single. I love how there is only 10 tracks on the album...straight to the point. I hope he wins some Grammy's in the future for this album because he truly deserves it.
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|I was really disappointed when I received this DVD. It wasn't the original version, it was a pirated disc in the case. I've ordered a lot of things from amazon over the years and never had any problems until now. And I'm pretty sure that pirating DVD's is illegal.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is such a great idea! My Grandson told me how to get this App. It is big numbers...Easyto read... Great idea!

034580404X|3.0|Still on book #1 and have lost interest...will resume soon, but its difficult to believe a woman who was a virgin, would get so wrapped up in this man's obsessions...hopefully it will get more interesting once I resume reading....
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It seems the Angry Birds app gets better and more challenging with each new app.I'm 65 years old and love Angry Birds!The only thing I don't like is when you get to one world there is no way to advance unless you buy extra weapons.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Got this for free on the kindle fire for my son. He was able to charge 3.99 twice for some kind of temporary special power. The Kindle automatically enables inapt purchasing which seems to be setting the owner of this device up for a head ache.
B00797MB0O|5.0|Its everything you would expect from the director of Up in the Air, and the writer of Juno.<br /><br />If you went to a High School in America and made into your 30's-40's, you will relate to this film.<br /><br />The film is about a past prom queen who always found life easy, always had everything she has ever wanted, discovers something something she can't and she sets herself on a quest.  Its not always pretty, funny or happy but sometimes it is and that's what makes this film is real.<br /><br />You can relate.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love my little pony and I love this game. It's the first game on my kindle that I've Bern addicted to.
B009O5CLZY|4.0|This is a fun game that passes the time. It is easy enough for the kids to play, yet challenging enough for adults not to get bored with it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What else can be said, I started out with not much idea what to expect... maybe a little blood, and killing, but instead found I could not wait to see the next show. I even started getting mad if they delayed it's release on Amazon, hmmm I guess I'm hooked now.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|i bought it for a child from our church giving tree. it was for a 9 year old girl who wanted a movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great graphics. addictive. very entertaining. love it. had to buy the full version.  couldn't put it down. cant wait for the sequel.
B000P0J09W|4.0|I have always enjoyed this movie.  I bought it on sale to have as one of those fun movies that everyone seems to enjoy.  Was surprised at the language that is used.  I hadn't remembered all the swearing that the kids do.  Won't be showing this one to my kids until they are older because of the that.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|The show was entertaining, nice story, and with good acting. If you like comic hero shows but with a little more realism to them, then you will find this TV series right up your alley.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love, love, love this television series! Can't wait till season three. After watching this I wanted more and unfortunately nothing could live up to it except Downton abbey!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a cute story and I found that I wasn't able to put it down once I started. The characters are likable and have a great sense of humor.<br />If this was a movie it would be a comedy romance and I would watch it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Had a friend that had all 3 - wound up reading the last 2 from her... wonderful book!!! Very descriptive, seems like you are watching a movie.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have read all of the Scarpetta books and enjoyed every one of them.  It is a very entertaining book.
B00631VJIC|5.0|this was great. we can't wait to watch the show every week.  I think Jax is hot.  Gemma is a connivivg bitch.
8866131768|3.0|I will always love the quality and the feel of Moleskine products. The new layout for the month view is a little difficult to get used to. I'm still in the adjustment period. As the new layout does save paper space, it's just completely different from what the majority of planners use for a monthly layout, so I'm not really sure I like it. Other than that, it is the normal, quality moleskine product you would expect.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|how are we supposed to check the weather when yesterdays weather shows up at that time? I mean come on what kind of weather app has no refresh button!
1426308469|5.0|I bought this for Christmas for my Grandson who is really big on dinosaurs now. I think it is a great product, and I am sure he will be pleased too.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|this is a great t.v. show.  I think the family dynamics is enough to make you wishthey gave you up for adoption.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I love the horror and the plot twists but overall this season isn't as good as season 1. I wasn't expecting the story to completely change from one season to the next but it does make it very interesting. It's like watching two different mini series in the same genre but with the same actors.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is one of the best ones out there.  This movie is awesome and repeat worthy, again and again and again.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Hearing the songs makes you think a lot about the show and how good it really is, also they all fit the mood of the show at the time, lots of great songs here.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The quality of the video is amazing and me and my kids watch it over and over, it is hilarious.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille is always enjoyable, however, he's going the way of all the writers these ays they're cheating on the ending.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Absolutely love the show! Action, humor, great storyline, and love the cast. I hope that the saga will continue for many years.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I have multiple yahoo emails I check all day long but now I can't because it stops working ALL OF THE TIME!  Thank goodness I have a gmail account that I will use until yahoo gets their act together. I cant believe they changed to be more like gmail and yet failed.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|My daughter loves Monster High.  This wolf doll is super cute!  Some of the Monster High dolls are a little crazy but I think this one is rather cute if you ask me.  Built great & we've had no issues.  Super soft nice hair.  Don't look like a cheap doll at all.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I choose five stars for this novel as rarely to I find a book that I can't put down.<br /><br />Fact is often a better read than fiction, as in this case.<br /><br />The story of a man who despite his many character flaws helped change the personal computer industry, phone industry, music industry, movie industry.... The list goes on<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in this, a great read.
B002HFJ77S|2.0|Not a real page turner. If your into ghost stories this is an ok book. Not my favorite kind of story
B0090YHSFC|4.0|Just a fun cute somewhat addictive game... The levels are easy to start then get more and more difficult. Honestly though, I've reached a level where I can't pass it and have put this game down.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|You have to buy the game on top of that it seems that you have to buy your way to the next level or so my kids have told me... We will not be doing that.  I think I like the reg old Angry Birds the best any how.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|My kids are loving the daily activities.  They fuss over who gets to do each day first and go through the days over and over.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|The movie was funny yet a little suspenseful. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were terrific. I would like to see it again.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great book of the complex events of a whole Magical and medieval society. Second book of the series Clash of kings by George RR Martin.
B00005JJX8|3.0|I have always enjoyed Alfred Hitchcock films and this movie is no exception. I've seen it many times and really looked forward to adding it to my movie collection. It had 2 BIG things going for it, the suspense (at which Hitchcock is an expert) and it stars Cary Grant and I love to watch him! However, this movie is not as I remembered it. It seemed to me it moved very slowly, that there was much too much time and emphasis put on Cary Grants characters' past and how much a great number of people disliked him. Although his character had been a highly respected member of the underground during the war he was now considered &#34;personna non grata&#34; by the very people who hailed him as a hero. The first 45 minutes of the film were devoted to establishing this fact. That's WAY too much time, this kind of character typing can be established by innuendo in a few sentences when directed properly. By the same token film time could have been devoted to the robberies or developing interesting character studies of the people who were robbed. This was touched on in the movie for about 3 seconds. The romance between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly also lacked substance or development. The masquerade ball significance was underdeveloped and totally misses creating the suspense it was intended to build up. I'm still trying to decide whether to keep this film in my movie library.
B003Q6CUAI|5.0|This is definately a program you can make part of your life. The good doctor speaks with authority with many years of wisdom behind him.
B00006FR47|4.0|I really enjoy this CD, if you like the classic Chicago, pre-top 40 pop, then this is for you. Because of teh longevity of this band I am able to enjoy the music with my father and both of us enjoy the older stuff.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|Was a much better app with more Options then I expected. Makes my kindle fire hd sound pretty awesome. Now I don't need my mini speaker set.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Michael Connelly Harry Bosch novel. Connelly once again demonstated his ability to write a novel you just don't want to put down. For anyone that wants to read a riviting novel that keeps you guesing this another one.
B0053O89Z6|3.0|This is one of my all time favorite tv shows and although I enjoyed watching this season, it was just not one of my favorites for some reason. Still, it continued to make me laugh throughout the episodes and I loved that Barney seems to be maturing just a little bit in this most recent season;-)
B00006FM77|4.0|My father has the LP's of this album and being a lover of Chicago, I've often wondered about this album. The 'live-ness' of this album isn't great and tends to wander a little bit, but the 'raw-ness' of the music I thinks makes this a must have for any fan of Chicago. If you are only into their hits - this isn't for you. If you enjoy the brass, percussion, and early Chicago sound - get this and as a bonus, you get more of the recordings than waht my dad did more than 30 years ago when he got the LP.
B003EVWDR0|4.0|A lot of people told me I would not like &#34; Avatar &#34;, but I did really like it. I thought the premise was quite unique and the special effects were great.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|it's never really all that accurate but what weather man/woman/station/app is? it does give me fairly accurate temps for the coming days that help me plan things out for work and home but if I'm wondering if it's snowing or raining I look outside
B0098VXMNE|5.0|I could not stop watching episode after episode.  Thought I would be disappointed with the new Spartacus but he is great.  It seems that Spartacus and his unfortunate followers (some of them) narrowly escape death every episode.  I keep saying to myself &#34;how's he going to get out of this one&#34;.
B000ZELISO|5.0|This film was great! The story moved great and the effects were outstanding. If you are into Harry Potter and enjoyed the other films - you have got to get this one too. If you haven't seen any other Harry Potter films, go see them, and make sure to get this one. A truly magical adventure!
B0076DELIG|5.0|As usual well written Connelly.  Harry always gives us hope on crime solving.  Details and research on procedures make stoy very real.
B0063IH60K|4.0|in just under a year I've played just under 7,500 games (I have no life) on my iPhone so when I got my Kindle Fire HD I figured I would need it on that too
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy navigation, quick response time. I like that it is actually better than the online website. It is condensed for ease of use.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I wasn't a Superman guy, and then Smallville happened to me. This season has a lot of nods and throwbacks because they knew that this would be the last season. I really enjoyed it and I think that Smallvile: Season 10 is my favorite. Great journey and a wonderful capstone. I'd recommend this for anyone that enjoyed Smallville or that wants a dose of superheroes without directly have super hero elements. So much of this series is as much about the personal stories as about the super hero and fantasical.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First off, I love every book that Colleen Hoover has written. She is amazing at bringing characters to life and conveying emotions. I hope she continues to write more books because she was really meant to do this.<br /><br />I read this book in one sitting but took multiple breaks because the subject matter was intense. I have to admit that there are many parts of this book that I did not find believable but it's a work of fiction. Maybe it was fate, or just pure coincidence that all of the characters were intertwined in some way, shape or form.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Sky - I liked Sky but I thought she was just annoying and quite selfish at times. She put herself in danger way too many times and had it not been for Holder, who knows that would've happened. I thought the emotions and flashbacks that she had were well written and I could relate to her with wanting to block out certain parts of your past. I questioned some of her choices but all in all, I liked her.<br /><br />Holder - Could there be a more perfect boyfriend??! He was intense and he had every reason to be. He was always there for Sky when she needed him (minus that one month...) and I fell in love with him. He was very protective of Sky and helped her deal with all of the issues she faced. I'm surprised that he handled some the situations the way that he did, like when he found out what Sky's dad did to her. For some reason, I thought that maybe he would show up at her dad's house and bash his face in but he never really left her. One thing I am wondering about--what did he punch that made his hand bleed and he needed to make a makeshift bandage?<br /><br />I liked the storyline and the chapter flowed well. The subject matter was heavy and intense and one that is not often spoken about. I felt emotionally drained after reading this book and really started to wonder how some people could do the things that they do. I would recommend this book but be prepared to deal for it to be intense.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I wasn't too sure about a movie about a teddy bear, but Ted was a fun movie to watch.  At times it was a bit crude, but overall the movie was genuinely funny, sweet and was a refreshing change from other movies which all seem to have the same story line.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|of cours I like it because there's many different games in this. and also it is challenging.  now that's my kind of game. I say GET IT!!!
B001FB4VZS|4.0|In all fairness, I love Smallville and while some people don't like a few of the seasons, I have enjoyed the ride. This season has a very different take on the origins of Doomsday. It wasn't my favorite, but it could have been much worse. Season 8 is the first real solid season of more of a super hero emphasis. I'll be watching them again, several times, and I look forward to the experience.
B009329Y30|5.0|Very Good I enjoyed it very much!!!!! The video quality and acting was out standing!!! the Plot was also very good!!!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|good game but too small to really choose all items. would be better on a laptop or notebook or desk top computer
B0035HKWM6|5.0|I'm telling you I've never seen a 3 year old little girl love a movie so much! I mean don't get me wrong, she loves her Dora the Explorer, Yo Gabba Gabba, Blues Clues, Mickey & Minnie Mouse & all of that but I don't know what it is about this movie that she loves so much but we have watched the dvd's so much that we are on our 3rd dvd of this movie because she's worn the other ones out LOL she even quotes the movie like &#34;SMOKIN&#34; or &#34;THATS A SPICY A MEATBALL&#34; or &#34;LOOK MOM IM ROAD KILL HA HA HA&#34;  LOL It is the funniest & cutest thing.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|TED (unrated)<br />Really believe the characters could be funnier without being vulgar. The evolution of kid to man was missing.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Anyone who could possibly think this was remotely funny is very immature! It was horrible an a waste of money and time to watch!
B00A0SMTXS|2.0|More time was put into the special affects than the story WAST OF MONEY, this movie strayed from the original story quit a  bit.<br />very dissapointed
B007REV4T8|4.0|Let's get one thing out of the way. \\"Skyfall\\" isn't the best Bond film ever.<br /><br />I find people have a fondness in their heart for the James Bond they grew up with. If your immediate response to the question \\"Who was the best Bond ever?\\" isn't Sean Connery, it is most likely the actor who played the secret agent when you were growing up. I have a fondness for Roger Moore because he was the first actor I watched playing Bond long before video and downloading made all of the films available at the touch of a button. It wasn't until I was a little older and could catch them at a Repertory Movie Theater, the kind that showed a different double-bill every night - do they even still exist? - that I was able to see Connery in action. Connery is the penultimate, but Moore is my Bond. And all of this history affects how you view every film in the series.<br /><br />For years, the producers and studio(s), have been claiming this Bond or that Bond would be a grittier, harder edged secret agent. Connery set the tone and made the role suave, debonair and a lady's man. But as time went on, the edge wore away until it was almost non-existent. The arc of Moore's films seems to have done the reverse. They started off tongue-in-cheek, become a little grittier and then crash-land back in Parody-ville with the unforgivable \\"A View To A Kill\\". Timothy Dalton was supposed to be the answer, but his two films are considered among the worst in the series. They are grittier, but they are also devoid of charm and fun. Pierce Brosnan was a welcome breath of fresh air and \\"Goldeneye\\" delivered on some of the promises of an evolution. But his films are pretty uneven (Denise Richards playing a nuclear scientist?). So the promises of Daniel Craig's new grittier, harsher Bond were met with skepticism by many.<br /><br />I'm sure someone, somewhere thinks Timothy Dalton is great. I have yet to find them, but that person must be out there somewhere.<br /><br />That said, \\"Skyfall\\" is the best Bond film in a long, long time.<br /><br />It seems like each actor takes one or two films to get their feet wet, to get accustomed to the character, to become comfortable enough to inhabit the role. Craig started the process with \\"Casino Royale\\", his first outing, which was very good, faltered a bit with \\"Quantum of Solace\\" and now returns. Three films in, Daniel Craig seems comfortable enough to both have fun and take a good hard look at his role and how he will define Bond. \\"Skyfall\\" stands head and shoulders above most because Craig explores some dark places, giving his portrayal a gravitas we haven't always seen. But he is also comfortable enough to give a wink - wink, nudge - nudge to the actors who have come before him. It is a little thrilling to watch an actor fully invested in his character, making it his own, giving depth and meaning to the role.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" works so well in equal parts due to Craig, the film's director, Sam Mendes (\\"American Beauty\\", \\"The Road to Perdition\\") and the writers, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (\\"Quantum of Siolace\\", \\"Casino Royale\\", \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" and the upcoming big screen adaptation of \\"Kojak\\" starring Vin Diesel), all smart enough to embrace the new direction Bond is headed in, while also acknowledging the past.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" goes back to Bond's origins in more ways than one. Silva (Javier Bardem), one of M's (Judi Dench) former agents is back and looking for revenge. He was once M's favorite and feels that she abandoned him during a difficult mission. He returns to steal a computer file containing the true identities of secret agents who are undercover. When he gets it, he threatens to release a certain number of names on a timed basis, threatening their lives and the missions. M wants the list back and sends Bond after it. But Silva is too good and is always one step ahead, manipulating everyone into doing exactly what he wants. Finally, Bond takes M to his childhood home, Skyfall, the Bond familyestate in rural Scotland. Silva wants M and Bond knows that she will prove too powerful a lure to resist, drawing the villain to a more level battlefield.<br /><br />Throughout, Bond wrestles with his own issues with M. Early on, she makes a controversial call and this leads the secret agent to question his loyalty to his boss. Then, when Silva enters the picture, Bond recognizes that he and the blond uber-villain are actually a lot closer than he may have anticipated. Silva knows this and uses this knowledge to push 007's buttons repeatedly.<br /><br />Along the way, Bond meets a new Q (played by Ben Whishaw, \\"Cloud Atlas\\", BBC's \\"The Hour\\") who brings a new, nerdy sort of computer geek-ese to the role. Ralph Finnes plays Gareth Mallory, a government minister who is keeping a very watchful eye on M and her department. And Albert Finney plays Kincade, the groundskeeper at Skyfall. All of these actors are welcome additions and add a lot of interest and considerable acting skill to the film.<br /><br />I think Bardem's performance is slightly overhyped. It is a good performance, but very similar to Anton Chiguhr in \\"No Country For Old Men\\". Both performances are very good, and fit with the respective films - Silva is more lighthearted and playful - but both men have the same intensity, drive and uncompromising attitude towards violence and mayhem. Bardem is a welcome addition to the Bond universe, but his role has a `been there, done that' feel to it.<br /><br />No Bond film would be complete without beautiful women. Naomie Harris plays Eve, Bond's partner in the mission they are engaged in during the opening of the film. She is a new kind of Bond girl; displaying considerable skill and intelligence, she could be 007's equal. Berenice Marlohe, a French actress, plays Severin, a complicated, slightly enigmatic woman who seems to be Silva's henchwoman. She spends some time with Bond and begins to have conflicting feelings.<br /><br />From the opening moments, \\"Skyfall\\" contains some terrific action. Unlike in some of the previous films, all of the action has at least a foothold in reality and all of it is linked to the story. In some Bond films, 007 seems to wander into action scenes devised to show off some new outlandish type of action or new device, narrative be damned. The gravity machine sequence in \\"Moonraker\\" is a good example of this. In \\"Skyfall\\", everything is connected to the MacGuffin, the computer list containing the identities of all of the secret agents working undercover. The film opens with Bond and Eve chasing a man through Istanbul, ending up on top of a train. When the list gets out of their hands, they soon learn Silva is behind the theft and will be publishing the identities. When Silva enters the picture, his plans seem to expand and encompass so much more, but they still start with the list.<br /><br />Throughout the film, there are winks back to the early days of Bond. At one point, the action centers on a deserted island Silva now uses as his headquarters. The island is pretty interesting and the back-story is that Silva created a `scare' clearing off all of the inhabitants, leaving behind scary Soviet-era looking apartment buildings and huge statues of former leaders. This is a nice little nod back to the overly elaborate lairs of past Bond villains like Blofeld and Stromberg. Late in the film, Bond and M rush to a secret garage and uncover Bond's Aston Martin, complete with the ejector seat. There are more references, which are worked into the plot in a satisfying way, allowing old-time Bond fans to enjoy the moments while bringing the story arc closer to the early films.<br /><br />When Craig was first announced as the new Bond, a lot of the publicity concentrated on his age. He was much younger than most of the actors who have played Bond, which led to the decision to `reboot' the series. But in \\"Skyfall\\", there is a lot of talk about how old Bond is, and jokes about how he should be retiring. It seems odd and out of place and even a little off-putting to be joking about his age when this very aspect was so highly touted as a positive just two short films ago. I really don't believe they are using this as the framework to introduce a new actor; Craig just signed a contract for two or three more films as 007 and \\"Skyfall\\" has now broken all box office records.<br /><br />My few quibbles aside, \\"Skyfall\\" is not just a terrific Bond film, but it is a great action film and will no doubt be considered one of the best of Craig's forays as 007.contains some terrific action.

076790592X|5.0|This book is one that will change your life. I read it a total of three times, and it still doesn't get old. As you get stuck in the every day hustle and bustle of life, you find yourself getting more impatient, less understanding, and overall flustered. After reading this book you want to stop what your doing and be grateful for what you have. It teaches you to let love in, and to take advantage of the people you have in your life now. Live in the moment! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone! It is not only a fast read, but also provokes some tears at some points. A great story, lesson, and book! Maybe you'll find a \\"Morrie\\" in your life.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Watch it several times a year. This movie never stops making me laugh. I plan on watching it again very soon.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Truly one of my favorite reads!  This book is an amazing debut novel.  I loved the characters - one more than the next.  The story was beautifully written.  I look forward to more by this author.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|One of the best shows, ever! I'm so glad to have this season, it's epic! I can't wait to get ahold of season 3!
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|follows the trend of Clancy, interresting and exciting.  I always learn something from his books and I enjoy the read

B009OYSFDM|5.0|I am glad I took a chance. I am now addicted and can't wait for the next season.  Hats off to the entire production team. I hope the quality of writing acting production remains at its current a high standard, at least.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|If you only have one Jethro Tull album this one is the one to have.<br />For the younger readers, this live album captures the essence of 1970's live rock, the band are truely performing - no lip sync'ing and I don't believe that there are any overdubs. To me it closed out the great live albums of the 70's (Who - Live at Leeds, Deep Purple - Made in Japan,ELP - \\"Welcome back....\\" and oddly, Neil Diamonds' Hot August Night).<br /><br />I saw Jethro Tull on this tour when it got to Australia and their performance was amazing: I don't think I ever went back to the Horden Pavillion - what I saw I felt just couldn't be topped. Although Ian Anderson's voice that night wasn't quite up to the standard on this album - I often suspect that the strain of the Busting Out tour was responsible for the marked deterioration in his voice afterwards. This album has the vibrancy, confidence and colour of being there, as others have said the band here are at their peak.<br /><br />For older readers it's like revisiting your youth.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and loved the way the author developed characters and story lines in that series.  This book fails to come anywhere close.  I'm glad I got my copy from the library.
0670026182|5.0|This book deserves to be on the shelf of every foodie! The recipes are creative and healthy, most of them can be prepared very fast not requiring long preparation, the photographs are simply putting you in the right atmosphere: honest, warm and casual good food. The design of the book is brilliant and it completes so well the whole concept. A titanic work went into the book, especially designed by Katie herself. I find harmful the reviews which say the book isn't good or that the photographs are out of focus. The ones that bought this book do not know how to appreciate art, and if they were guided wrong by some trend or person which said \\"you have to have, even if is not what you are looking for\\", then is the problem of the buyer not of the creator. The rest of you who still enjoy good things made with heart, just buy the book! :)
B005G5PPGS|5.0|this is a really fascinating read.  I looked at the movie and had to check out the book.  good entertainment and informative.
B0000CD5I6|3.0|A slightly different Christmas fare to the usual carols -which if you are like me drive you crazy after some hours.<br /><br />I wont repeat the track listing - the first couple of tracks I was surprised by - they were good, engaging but also capable of being background music (not something that I would ever have though Jethro Tull could do). A solid generally well arranged album although I find I loose interest in the middle (Last man at the party?) before reengaging for the remainder.<br /><br />In short a good buy for tull afficionados and recommended for anyone after something a little different for the festive season. You won't upset your grandparents with this:-)
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My grandson loves this game.  He makes all the animals feel better!  We must do this before we go to bed each night!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is fantastic - I bought it for my vacation and I was laughing out loud while I read it on the beach. I would recommend this book to anyone who is in the mood to laugh for hours... such a great read.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This game is a little different from the other bubble games by having some special tools to use such as the saw blade.  I also like that it limits the number of balls you get so you have to be careful in how you clear the screen.
B001NEXEEG|4.0|This movie has a different twist to it. Plus it has a great cast of stars. Lee Marvin playing a nasty villain, Jimmy Stewart playing a greenhorn trying to do the right thing and The Duke playing a bit of a back seat role. Well done.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|If you are a fan of science fiction AND/OR a fan of the short-lived series Firefly, you will most likely fall in love with this movie. Joss Whedon sure knows how to spin an amazing tapestry of adventure, excitement and humor!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|a fun game that is very addicting. Only flaw i see is if i want to close the program and do somthing else sometimes i can &#34;save and quit&#34; but other times its hard to get the menu to load.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I usually don't watch TV shows, but I got hooked on this one.  I really love the post-apocalypse story line.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Aliens, slime, time travel, satire, a world wide catastrophe to avert,  great banter, a touch of sentiment, two fabulous actors. What's not to love?<br /><br />As expected, MIB once again delivers. I never notice who the writers are, but I'm very appreciative of their work. These writers are exceptional. (The rest of the team was pretty darned good too.)
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I love Roma Ryan's lyrics, the narrative quality of the songs, and Enya's voice is as beautiful as ever.  Some might complain that it sounds too much like her previous work, but when you've achieved perfection, why fix it?  Like most of her music, you will grow to appreciate it even more with repeated listenings.  Especially wonderful is her rendering of O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.  I've never heard anything more exposed, transparent, or delicate.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This app is very fun cause u don't need inherent to use it!!  There is a tourement mode and quick play and multiplayer and single mode!!!!!  On multilayer u can do local or one dievce or random ppl! Hope u enjoy this apply if u do get it I reccomend jump in rules.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|A friend of mine recommended Nelson DeMille to me a while ago and he's rapidly becoming one of my favorite authors.<br />The writing is really excellent, unlike a lot of modern books that read like they were written by a panel of monkeys. The characters are wonderful (I especially like John Corey, a very wise-ass NY city cop.) I also love how DeMille weaves a fictional story around real events and even local legends. His books are the kind that I can't put down but at the same time I want them to go on and on and on.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I loved it, really I did. In fact I wish it were longer. The audience was left to fill in a LOT of the character development in fact, most of that depended upon assumption and inference. Mind you, the writers and director did an expert job at setting up the inferences, but it still resulted in characters that were drawn a little shallow. I could have happily spent twice the time with these characters, and really wish that had been an option.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This is the best book I´ve ever read as an entrepreneurs. I recommend totally if you´re trying to search/validate a business model.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a riveting story. I couldn't stop reading. I am glad I waited to read this because now I can go right on to Catching Fire.
B009ZE27US|1.0|What a waste of server space. Don't waste the bandwidth downloading this crap app. I feel kind of dumb having downloaded this knowing my Kindle Fire has no way to scan anything.
B008133MDK|5.0|Can't wait for the next season. I can't believe the same actor who plays Watson is also the Hobbit. Great show.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Sony PS-LX300USB USB Stereo Turntable (Black)  It is just what I expected----simple to operate---good quality--and I don;t understand why this has to be so long
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I was immediately attracted to this book after hearing the phrase \\"A cross between Julia Child and Jason Bourne\\"  I bought the book on my Kindle while on vacation expecting to be underwhelmed.  Holy information overload, Batman!!!<br />If you are an early generation Kindle user, do yourself a favor and buy the hardcover!  The photos are hilarious, detailed and very informative.  The cooking information was concise, but fun and imaginative to read.  If for nothing more than making my own powdered Nutella, this book has a place in my kitchen forever.
0143121006|5.0|Paul French did an amazing job bringing to life a China of an other era in his book. The mystery surrounding Pamela Werner's murder was a page turner. Once I started the book I could not put it down. What was so very sad was that it is all true. It shows how a corrupt law enforcement mixed with political pressure can totally make the rule of law devoid of any justice. I am glad that Paul French created some sort of justice for Pamela and her family through telling her story.<br />I wish we could all say this would never happen today but I fear little has changed in man or the corruption of man. What has changed hopefully is that someone was willing to tell the story and show all of the work her father did to try to see her murderers brought to justice, that is great.<br />Mr.French , my hats off to you, you made the book interesting , exciting, page turning  but also you showed the humanity of the people involved. You showed how much a father cared for a daughter. And we all realized that sometimes the good guys don't win and evil will prevail but in your telling of the story that is now 70+ years old we see that in the long run those people involved had justice thrust upon them by circumstance. What goes around, comes around!
B00632HWOG|1.0|worst app I have ever had. won't load my emails. if I type an email and then try to send it, the app routes the email to my outbox where it sits because no matter what I do, I cannot figure out how to send it from there. terribly disappointing.

B0087URXZU|5.0|Even better than I anticipated, If you like Joe, you love this. i would buy again. Hope he keeps going.
B002JVWRAO|1.0|its broken. the discs are intact but the case is broken on the side- soooo not like new and inside the spine that hlds the dvds is broken too. soooo not satisfied.
B009POCG0Y|4.0|The description:  A Totally Twisted Deep Fried Texas Redneck Trailer Park Murder Story\\", it says it all.<br />It is a story between a Texas family and a hired killer based on a play by the to-be-watched playwright Tracy Letts and directed by the master filmmaker William Friedkin.<br />Among the master filmmakers, Friedkin is one of the few who continues to produce brilliant films with wisely selected independent projects.<br />His latest film is an expertly directed and acted film by the ensemble team headed by the continue-to-amaze Matthew McConaughey and the brilliant script with an engrossing story which seamlessly mixed macabre with humor, with excellent cinematography, art direction and music.<br />Other than McConaughey, Emile Hirsch, Juno Temple, Gina Gershon and Thomas Haden Church gave everything they have to this film.<br />The only negative aspect of this film is the violence which is excessively done, in my view.<br />If the violence in this film could be toned down (others may like it) with more editing and Matthew McConaughey's character could be less clean-cut and more oily, this film could be even be more perfect.<br />Highly recommended, if you can tolerate extreme violence.
B009B0L324|4.0|I bought it becasue I love AC DC but it is nothing new if you already have the DVD. Just filling a void I would guess but this band always rocks!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|The cast is allstar and the movie keeps your interest,the ending is a shocker too.I think your gonna watch this movie several times like I did.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Excellent story line.  Main female character lived a life of secret and felt she could never share her true feelings and thoughts.  She was living the perfect life according to her parents and lifelong boy friend.  The truth was much more difficult leading her to the ending choices that she made.  The parents, in particular the mother,  blamed everyone but herself for the choices her daughter made.  She wanted to help others but missed the family member in most need of help.  As we think of our society today this is probably true of many more families that we would ever realize.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Always look forward to a novel by Nelson DeMille who I consider to be the master of the suspense theme. This is one of his very best reads. Thanks Nelson for a great read. Was sorry to come to the end.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|I think that if I had to pick a top 10 lifetime band list thse guys would be on it. I have always been a Glenn Hughes fan and thats why I bought this and all the other releases. This band should be bigger than they are. Buy it and support a great band.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|could of been a little better for sure but its just a Batman movie so you have to get passed the silly toys and weapons in this and just enjoy it.I am a big Christian Bale fan but would only rent this never buy it unless its really cheap.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I so enjoyed &#34;The Fall of Giants&#34; that I knew I had to read the next book in the series.  I think Ken Follet is one of the best writers of WWI and II Historical Fiction books that I alway read anything I can from him.  &#34;Winter of the World&#34; picks up exactly where the first book left off ~ equally as riviting!  Can't wait for the next one!

B00AMBK0X4|2.0|It did not have a good story line and I did not think it was that funny. The previews basically showed all the funny parts.
1401322786|4.0|Mitch Albom, author of the bestselling \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" and \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" returns with a new novel about a subject that frequently dominates our lives: time.<br /><br />Of all the creatures on earth, \\"man alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour. And, because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear that no other creature endures. A fear of time running out.\\"<br /><br />Album tells the story of three childhood friends growing up thousands of years ago. Dor and Alli marry and have children. Their friend Nim becomes king. Dor becomes the first man ever interested in time. He learns to count the hours and creates the first sundial and water clock. Dor's family is always poor because no one values his inventions, but Nim has become hugely powerful. He wants to challenge the gods and sets out to build the Tower of Babel. Dor wants no part of it and as a result, he and Alli are exiled.<br /><br />When Alli becomes sick and is near death, Dor is willing to do anything to save her. He decides to climb the Tower of Babel, reach heaven, and stop time. For this, God punished him by imprisoning him in a cave where he is sentenced to \\"listen to the misery counting the moments creates.\\" He becomes the mythical Father Time.<br /><br />In our own era, Sarah Lemon is a tortured high school student in love with a boy who doesn't share her feelings and publicly humiliates her. Victor Delamonte is a rich man searching to extend his life indefinitely. When Father Time is released from his sentence, he is instructed to \\"find two souls on earth, one who wants too much time and one who wants too little. Teach them what you have learned.\\" In teaching them, he also teaches us.<br /><br />\\"The Time Keeper\\" is a modern-day fable. Dor, Sarah and Victor are all flawed characters dealing with the complexities and pains of life. Readers will identify with them. \\"The Time-Keeper\\" is a quick read that invites readers to think about that most precious of gifts: the gift of time.the gift of time.

B003QTWR08|5.0|Our entire family absolutely loves this movie.  To me, this is possibly the best Pixar movie ever.  There is a definite political and social message underlying this, but that is actually what makes it so great.  An animated movie can actually get you to stop and think about the world

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Page turner, pleasure to read, complex other-world, awesome protagonist. Hugh Howey did a great job on this book! I am reading the 6th now, and totally into it. I highly recommend Wool for anyone that enjoys sci-fi series. Loved it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Lots of fun!  Love Star Wars and Angry Birds, great combo.  Great graphics want more worlds to come as soon as possible.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This is likely the last Bourne movie that will be worthy of a theater screening, and I have to think it only made the cut based on the series' reputation, and the start (namely Edward Norton) in this one.<br /><br />The plot was far too out-sized for the movie, which didn't have the time to invest in all of the tangents that it mentioned.  At it's core, this movie is true to the series, though.  In fact, he first 30 minutes are very well done, and add value to the series.  As it progresses, more and more characters are introduced, or re-introduced from previous movies in the series.  Ignore most of these asides, and the plot flows more smoothly.<br /><br />If you're an action fanatic, then yes, there is an overdone chase scene with multiple vehicles, winding streets, and even a \\"bad-guy\\" character introduced just for the scene to give the protagonist real competition.  In contrast to the opening of the movie, the finale is a cliché and formulaic gimmick.<br /><br />All-in-all, watch the movie if you love the series, but try to catch it on sale.
B0000DD79B|5.0|I gotta say, I love this album. I was in universty in the revoulutionary 60s & if you didn't listen to these guys there was something wrong.<br /><br />I have several S & G albums, but on one of them, a live concert, the sound quality is very bad.<br /><br />What else can I say? There are two discs with 33 in total songs on them.This 2-CD set has it all. If you like S & G., this is the only album you need.
B00AHSF4AQ|5.0|Great movie, my child loves it and HD is awesome.  we downloaded on to our kindle fire so he can watch it when we go somewhere.
B007L24T52|4.0|Baldacci writes well... plot is interesting... simple and clean writing ..his novels are gripping. I am a die hard Baldacci fan!
B0012QVJXS|5.0|This is a great classic movie.  With all the new super-hero movies out it's good to know the originals still exist!  I was also very happy with the streaming quality of this older movie!
B000005HCM|5.0|My review is entitled as it is, because Lee Morgan, one of the most talented jazz trumpeters in the world died in his early 30s when his common law wife came to the club where he eas gigging & shot him cold dead between sets. You'll excuse the biographical info.<br /><br />I have about 1000 CDs, most of them jazz & this is way up there in my favs. I always say you are judged by the company you keep, & you have Joe Henderson (T.S.); Barry Harris (P) plus bass & drums, one magnificent quintet. Considering when this recording was made the first tune \\"Sidewinder\\" has a very funky beat. The interplay among the musicians is great.<br /><br />I could say more about the other tunes, but what's the point? In jazz, the theme is stated, then the musicians take their improvs & they end with the theme again.<br /><br />All I can add is that this recording has amazing sound, from a technical point of view, & if you don't have it in your collection, it is very incomplete.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|A return to form for LP.  They are one band that has grown with me, and their sound evolves across CDs.  If you are a fan of the band you will love this CD.  It's a shame it has become trendy to hate on them, I believe most of those people like the band but want to appear hip-to-hate.  Good buy!
1603425381|5.0|This is the best book for crochet edgings I've seen yet.  Her instructions include charted and written patterns, and are clear and easy to follow.  The outstanding characteristic of this book is the encouragement to change things up and be really creative.  Everyone who crochets needs a copy of this book.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|love this game and love it that is different each time. my kids love it too and play all the time

B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Set in the 60's, it has a slew of great actors. It is one of those kitschy movies that you just can't stop watching despite the absurdity of it all. Don't take it seriously and it is fun.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I viewed this movie solely because I appreciate Pixar movies.  Some potential viewers may be put off by the plot, but let me assure you that everyone I watched this with enjoyed it immensely.  You won't be disappointed, and the Amazon streaming service performed flawlessly.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is the most convincing account of life after death I've ever heard about or read.  It's the first time I've put to rest my own musings about whether or not near death accounts are produced by the natural workings of a dying brain or are truly something &#34;beyond.&#34;  I've always liked Carl Sagan's quote (paraphrased) about &#34;retaining an open mind, but not so open your brains fall out&#34;.  In this case, I'm not prepared to dispute the conclusions of a highly trained neurosurgeon that the brain itself could not create the experiences he had.  I believe Dr. Alexander has turned his personal experience into a highly valuable gift to the world, and I'm grateful to him.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Noomi Rapace does a great job in her trilogy of the &#34;Hornets Nest&#34; This role is not strong enough for her talents. She is a great  heroine and I would like her to have more opportunities to display her gifts. The super computer geek suits her.

B004NYQYNQ|5.0|In a day and age when everyone is autotuned and production is huge listening to this is like a breath of fresh air. Its organic in its simplicity and powerful in its delivery. This album speaks to everyone in every generation. It is truly a work of art.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent remake of the comic book series with superb changes in the story. I especially like the new characters that have been introduced. Of all the deaths, I hated to see Lori go. I keep wondering what it will take to kill off all the walking dead? They surely must be susceptible to something.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Maybe it's because I am a little long in the tooth myself. Not romantic. Not comedy. Not a sense of truth. It was as though the writer were imagining her parents' sex life but in the 1950's. A shallow made-for-TV movie only somewhat saved by brilliant actors. I want my money back.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I can not get it to download.  I have tried several times with no luck. any help would be loved
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Saw the movie twice in the theater.  Laughed harder the second time.  Well worth owning the movie in my opinion.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn fails to disappoint..... again.  AWESOME BOOK!!!  Highly recommend all of his books.  I've read them all at least 3 times and I continue to read them all still.
B0076DELIG|3.0|having read all the Harry novels I would rate this this one a tired Harry. I think that Connelly has put all the old Harry Clichés from his previous books back into this one. Having said this it is still a nice comfortable read.
B0086700CM|5.0|At first, I believed it might be a game you would like to play when board, but no, it is so much more. This game is pretty fast paced after a while and is addicting.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love the graphics and that it linked to my game on facebook, but did not show the special Christmas or tournement rooms.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|Well worth the price and a fantastic production as well! I really liked the way the program was set up
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Decent but not great.  The actors are very good but at times the storyline could have been followed or clarified better.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|This is an unusual story with huge amounts of action and entertainment. Uma Thurman gives a thoroughly enjoyable performance. -

B009NOVCTM|5.0|I loved the remix and selection of hits! Great buy for the stones monumental hits. I especially liked the eras
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Although many readers may know before reading the book that a genius is very seldom an easy person this book about Steve Jobs really takes the cake. I found this book more interesting than many unauthorized biographies where the flaws of a character are exposed in order to create more sales. The fact that Jobs himself gave absolutely free hands to Isaacson and even encouraged him to tell the truth makes this book excellent. As a big fan of Apple products and Jobs himself this book put me in difficult position. What should I think of this guy who has given so much great products to the world but who in his private life is a total jerk? Isaacson's book tells intriguing stories about how the famous Apple products were created and what were the origins of Jobs' search of perfection. Great book.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|This is a very worthy conclusion that fully lives up to the quality of volume 1. It's a satisfying ending when she finally finds Bill and is united with her daughter.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|Thanks to LEGO for the really perfect, extremely cute and creative, colourful Christmas Present for a five year old boy!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|As usual Cher has outdone herself on this one. It is truly awesome!! Loved it and watch it over and over.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I thought I'd like the novel--the characters and their issues were at first interesting and provided the author many options for the conclusion.  Unfortunately, she chose an easy, pat finish that seemed implausible for the male and unsatisfying for the reader.  I was left feeling like it was a real waste of my money.
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|been waiting on this album for ages. long time coming. Hallelujah at the end really shows where T.I. is at, very raw.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|It is a riveting book.  As you are reading it, you are thinking have we ever come close to this actually happening - is a cyber war - a war of the future.  Excellent, sit on the edge of your seat book.<br /><br />Well done.!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Watched season 1 on Netflix, I love all the Disney fairytales. I already bought season one on DVD and I will buy season 2 when it comes out. So far we have been alot of fairy tales in these seasons. Can't wait till January till it is on again. One of the best shows ever!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Was a little late catching on to the Walking Dead popularity and have caught up quickly.  Great show, can't get enough!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Yup that sums it up - every time I watch an epispode I either empathize with or recognize one of the characters! Whats not to love? Oh and Penny is HOT!
0425263908|5.0|Fantastic reading couldnt wait to read book 2 of this sequel. reccommend if you are a fan of Fifty Shades of Grey
B007EECSFA|5.0|Very enjoyable to read!  The story was interesting from beginning to end and kept me guessing all the way through.  Loved it.
B008602KQI|5.0|I'm looking forward to seeing the new movie when it come out. I am pleased to add Hunger Games to my collection.
B000002P6R|3.0|Love the Who and this is a fun album, though a few songs are just plain goofy. If youre a fan - you should have this and you probably already know it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved the book and can hardly wait for Book 3 of the Trilogy. I enjoyed revisiting all the characters from Fall of Giants.  It was definitely a book I couldn't put down.
0062235893|1.0|This is not what I had expected.  I expected a hardback book as the description stated plainly.  I wont return this item because it will cost additional money to do so.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|Brendan always does a good job of entertaining! This movie is no different. A good family movie. I suggest you add Journey 2 &#34;The Mysterious Island&#34; with Dwayne Johnson to your collection as well.
0811821846|4.0|This was a gift and my bud said &#34;I think it was incredibly good fun for me and my son&#34;.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I saw the movie and then I had to read the book. I got seasick.  But I kept reading. The religiousity bores me so I skipped some of those paragraphs.
0446580848|5.0|DeMille does a great job with this one. He kept me rivited to each page. I highly recomend this one!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Probably the better of all the Mission Impossible movies Tom Cruise has done. I am pleased to add it to my collection and hopefully will see another soon.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Aside from loving the movies - this set is freakin awesome! We had a Dark Knight trilogy marathon when this came in and we were all glued to the screen for the 9 hours! The extras are nice with the book and extra disks. WELL worth the price!
B000OLRH10|5.0|Blood Diamond is a true story of how material objects, greed, and selfishness can get in the way of doing the right thing, having compassion and empathy. If you have a conscience and a good heart it will make you think twice about wanting diamonds instead of opting for CZ or the like. Leonardo is very good and conviencing as a self-centered, greedy guy with a conscience and a good heart- deep down inside. But is it strong enough to make him do the right thing? The other actors in this movie are believable as well in what their mission is and how they feel about the diamond trade business in African and killing for it. At times it's hard to take the horrific scenes of violience; mostly because you know that really happened and still happens today. The price of diamonds is like the price of oil/gas, but is it worth killing and dying and going to war about them? Are diamonds really as necessary to have as oil/gas? It's the kind of movie that really gets you involved with what is happening to the characters and after the movie is over it sticks with you-in your mind and heart- and you want to talk with someone who has seen the movie. I would call it a must see movie for many reasons, but if you're looking for a romantic comedy this is not the movie you want to see. It does have just about everything else though- drama, action, truth, and good acting and cinematography.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|It's great having a sturdy cover for the Kindle Fire and I was looking forward to the stand feature.  However, that feature is not very reliable.  It sees the slightest push on the Kindle (typing, etc.) collapses the stand and if I'd known this before, I don't think I would have bought the product.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I enjoy the animation of watching people create & solve puzzles!  The colors are pretty & the words to choose from are for the most part interesting.
B004LWZW4W|4.0|As an old school Planet of the Apes fan I HATED the remake and was terrified of this movie until I saw it. SOLID story telling coupled with character development and solid performances! The best Ape movie since Beneath!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome.  I don't know why their are so many nagitive reveiws. I think it is awesome. because you can kill these. things: zombies, skelotons, creepers, and spiders.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|item worked great at first for about 6 months (longer than most other people have found) but then the item gradually began to fall apart, cut out and now has stopped working completely. i bought this adaptor because it is the one sold on the apple store...never again!!! cheap rip-off useless thing selling for 4 times more than all the other adaptors. don't waste your money.
B000SZK41M|5.0|Die Hard is a classic of American moviemaking. Bruce Willis at his BEST, cracking wise, just minding his own business... when he gets pulled into a big heist.<br /><br />Bad timing? Wrong place, wrong time? Only for the bad guys.<br /><br />The only villainous foil that could stand up to Willis' awesomeness? Alan Rickman, of course.<br /><br />Brilliant, fun, and full of action, but without gratuitous gore and blood.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to rent or buy NOW.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|This was an awesome cartoon and I cant wait for part II. Never thought this grahpic novel would make it to screen!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed the graphics and the twisted storyline. I like that their is'nt just find the objects games. this game is full of brain teasing mini games!!!!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie is universally accepted as the gold trimmed platinum standard of the genre. The writing, the action, the pacing, the special effects, it's literally the perfect action/adventure/superhero movie. Nothing in the DVD release detracts from that.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|\\"The Best and Unexpected\\". This Wool series has been unexpected non predictable and addictive reading. All my criteria for an excellent read. I read a very lot and this is a series I have now read twice. Highly recommend to a varie...
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Ok - I wont review the movie since we all know it is one of the best popcorn and super hero movies EVER. The Blu Ray has great deleted scenes and outtakes and is well worth it.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|fruit ninja i like it dont like the computer always winning it is also very addictive i would recommend it to anyone
B007HACDLK|4.0|Or maybe it's that the repetitive grossness is getting a bit stale. Too much slaughter gets to me, at last.
B000M39HB8|5.0|The perfect holiday movie...the whole family will enjoy and sing along.<br />Doesn't get much better than Bing Crosby during the holidays.
B0009A40ES|5.0|Funny...never thought about it...Bateman is only one letter away from Batman! One of the greatest psycho thrillers EVER. If you have not seen this movie you are just wrong.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|i love Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. I have the other 2 movies  and i will buy this one too. I like the comedy sy fi movies. I have to admit that Josh Brolin is a great young TLJ.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Fun and moving. A few twists and turns, really enjoyed the show. It was worth all hype. Bale's over the charts
B007HACDLK|5.0|After a couple of decades in the Special Ops world I find Vince's work right-on, amazingly accurate and insightful.  He is always relevant and realistic.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|This was a true sleeper of a movie and I didnt see it until it was on DVD - I laughed my butt off. This is destined to be a cult classic before its time!
B00AMBLDEE|1.0|Quoted in a review as the movie you will be sorry you watched in the morning. They weren't kidding. Very boring and forgettable.
0393342212|5.0|This has been around a long time but is still one of the very best books on this subject. Challenging because it requires parents to analyze their own behavior, assumptions and history, but effective for those reasons. Highly recommended if one is really motivated to address the problem in a lasting and humane way.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I fell in love with Colleen Hoover after reading her first books, Slammed and Point of Retreat, and have been anxiously awaiting this new stand alone book. Let me just say that she did not disappoint. Not only did she not disappoint, but she blew me away. This book is just incredible, awe-inspiring, amazing... I can't find the right words. I will urge everyone I know to read this book, it's not to be missed.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|Great album!!! There isn't one song I don't love. My only complaint is that I wish the album had more songs!!
B009439HEY|5.0|Each recording is as authentic as the original and more than not even more incredible! Thank you Steve for your rather strange endeavor!!!!!
B009ZE27US|1.0|My daughter got this app and she is 10 but it said she was 49!!! I tried it and I am 39 and it said I was 84!!! I have seen dumb apps and I think this is maybe 1 of the dumbest apps I have ever seen. (Do not get this app.)
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I love this movie. I wish I had a talking Teddy Bear that should like Peter Griffin. I hope to get this for Christmas
B009JBZH54|5.0|The case is as shown and has a very nice feel to the outside of it like felt. The case has within it a picture book of the batman trilogy, behind-the-scene photos and making-of photos. For under 30 dollars, it is a great value. The third movie included in this case, The Dark Knight Rises, is around 25 dollars alone. It is almost like getting the first two movies for free.<br /><br />The Bane character is too serious for a batman movie, but overall the last movie is good quality. I prefer the Joker character.
B000GOU4M4|5.0|Great movie, one of Chevy's classics out of the National Lampoon series.  A Christmas staple to be played over and over.
B000TENKEK|5.0|I've had the album since it came out. This is easily their best. It handily beats Plastic Beach, another great release.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Didn't see the series on TV so glad it is available on DVD.  I have preordered #3 and looking forward to continuing viewing the storylines.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Loved the special effects. Kate Beckinsale was wonderful, she went toe to toe with Colin Farrell. It had a great ending!
B0099114WO|5.0|It was refreshing to see a movie about a couple over 30 who had been married for many years, but had forgotten the joy of marriage and love.  The subject matter was real and believable and you could almost feel the emotions, especially if you've been there.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were wonderful together, and Steve Carrell's performance was amazing. I truly enjoyed it!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Absolutely worth the price. The high definition upgrades are absolutely worth it and the developer's commentary is infinitely interesting. Ever since I played Shadow of the Colossus on PS2, I've wanted to play it again in better quality. Granted, the upgrades are not The Last Guardian level, but they're definitely noticeable and worth it. The games themselves are classics and don't need a review from me. You will cry every single time. They're great games that explore interesting methods of story-telling and when one looks past the basic theme of &#34;girl in trouble, boy saves girl.&#34; they're quite deep games.
B0086700CM|5.0|fun and additive.it is fast paced and upgradable. I like that.Also good graphics and funny quotes when you die or crash.I hope u like iy
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|As a fan of Seth Macfarlane's work for years, I watched this movie having high expectations for it, perhaps too high. The movie was a comedic disappointment. You can have all the laughs you are going to get out of this movie from the official trailers, and you can skip the rest.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I thought this movie would be funnier.  It had a few funny jokes with a lot of filler in between.
0131103628|5.0|I used this as a reference when learning C. Absolutely wonderful. Granted, there are some things in here people shouldn't be doing anymore as they're not socially acceptable (type-casting mallocs, for instance,) but it's still a great reference.<br /><br />What this book is not for, but people seem to propagate it for: this isn't for a person who has never programmed before or who has no idea about basic program constructs or programming concepts. It's really meant as an introduction to a language, not an introduction to programming.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This is a really good app but I hate everything about the characters! They are soooooooooo ugly but I also notice that the noises that they make are freakin weird and retarded! So I reccomend it but the characters are akward!
B009ZE27US|3.0|Really people? Have you not read the description?  Are there that many ridiculously dumb people out there? Even if kids, if they are able to write a review, they should be able to read the description - it's not supposed to work!  I haven't even used the app.  My 9 yr old daughter downloaded it and like a good parent, I check up on what she downloads (imagine that).  Have never written a review nor probably will again but the other reviews were just so ridiculous, complaining that it didn't get the age right.  Once again, it tells you its not supposed to work!  I agree it may be stupid, but there's plenty of stupid apps. that some people (like my 9 yr old daughter) find vaguely entertaining - especially when free (someone complained about the cost, again - really? Its free!).  What might add some more entertainment is if you could secretly type in the person's age ahead of time to make them actually think it works.  Until then people - get a clue!
030758836X|3.0|I feel that contemporary authors are competing to push the envelope.  I think that this book was well plotted and developed.  However, so many current books are so coarse.  I find it hard to believe I'm so far out of the mainstream.  I realize I'm part of a generation that would like to think of itself as kinder, gentler. I also know that is not necessarily true.(I'm 75, but I have 5 of the grandchildren in college, so I'm not entirely in lala land.) But, does the language now have to be so explicit?<br />  The fact that the author doesn't want her son to read the book until he is a certain age, indicates to me that she has her own reservations.  Do editors insist on all this sex and R rated language to sell books?<br />  This is the first review I have written.  Obviously, I liked the book enough to express my thoughts.  Would I recommend it to someone to read?  Unfortunately, No.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The two stars I gave this movie was generous, because if was simply ridiculious and a waste of my money. I wished there was a way to get my money back
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Got the GREATEST deal ever on this during the Lightning deals. Got me started on the season.<br />If you're interested in anything from the south, it will interest you. The &#34;zombie&#34; experience is amazing as well, but<br />usually not my thing. The writing, characters, and &#34;set&#34; (city of Atlanata for the first season), are the best parts!
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|A fun game that won't disappoint.  A bit short, but easy to navigate and really enjoyed the Christmas holiday characters - and story.  Great holiday gift.
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|I love this original.  I watch it time to time when I want my mind blown again!  This is just as plausible as most religions I am aware of.  So much so I think some scientists are still looking to find evidence we live in a digital world made of pixels.  Anyhow great action movie otherwise.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This was a Great movie,Realistic and not so fantasy . With modern day understanding I can see our government actually implimenting a secret program such as this.
B0063IH60K|2.0|When you have to deal with a commercial after every game of solitaire, it takes the enjoyment out of the game.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Mediocre entertainment, but worth the watch.  Atleast Mark Walburg did better than the bear acting.  Didn't make want to go buy myself a Teddy as an adult.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|tHERE SHOULD BE MORE movies of the true nature shown, because this was part of our Country&#34;s way of Life.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|While the movie has nice recognizable stars the plot makes absolutely no sense. So, there's this tube going thru the middle of the earth... for some reason one side of the earth wants to invade the other... why doesn't the other just destroy the tube?!?! Maybe I'm missing something here..<br /><br />Some decent action in the movie.. maybe.. I guess...
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|There are some good laughs in the movie, but its like watching an extended live version of Family Guy.<br /><br />The movie at times tries to hard to be funny and it comes off as just lame material.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book cover to cover in a day over Thanksgiving break in 2011.  I thoroughly enjoyed it even though its a teen novel and Im in my Thirties.  I enjoyed it so much I was excited when I heard a movie based on it was coming in 2012.  Don't be fooled the film was only loosely based on the book, and was meant to entertain idiots.  If you watched the movie but didn't read the book, cleanse your mind by reading the book.  If you read this book but didn't see the movie, you didn't miss a thing.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I purchased this game because my 8 year old grandson loves Angry Birds and I needed something to entertain him before a big family dinner started at church.  He loved the game and I have played it since and I love!  1st and 3rd generations loves this game!  And, it was free!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This was probably the best movie of the year. I loved every single minute of it and would watch this again and again if I had the time.
B007FROH4G|5.0|A wonderful insight into dementia by someone whomust have some background knowledge. Loved the book couldn't put it downmay be helpfulfor familieswith someone in the early stages  of dementia
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is becoming a family tradition. One we watch every year. Now that we all have HDTVs it's time to upgrade from the tired VHS copy we have.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is really addicting and I love this game you can't never stop playing this game like ever I always play it whenever I'm bored
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great! Non stop action. Only draw back is the Andrea storyline. Cant wait for it to resume. Money well spent.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It was a good movie, it dragged here and there and the story seemed to get a little out there, at least to me.  Maybe if you keep your expectations realistic despite all the hype that it has received you will be able to enjoy it more.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Fun Game with lots of different levels on which to play.  There are some glitches for those playing on Kindle Fire but still lots of fun & challenge here!
B0072V394E|4.0|This is no &#34;Clint Eastwood&#34; Spaghetti Western. The plot is slightly less well done, the characters aren't developed quite as well, and the filming isn't quite as good. On the other hand, there aren't any new Spaghetti Westerns coming out. I hated the movie so much I bought another and will probably end up buying a couple of DVDs that aren't available on demand.  All and all, a good buy.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If you are addicted to Angry Birds as I am, you will find Angry Birds Rio a fun challenge.  New graphics.  It's not just the Piggies anymore!
B006K2WXOI|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas stories.  The pictures are beautiful and in the words of my six year old, \\"I like it!\\"  They have seen the movie several times, and I think you will love the movie as well, as they really expand on the story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps me entertained. as well as my children.  my kids can play these games for hours.  simple yet challenging and that's what makes us keep coming back for mpre
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Exactly what I wanted: an expose on accelerated learning taught through the world of cooking. Apply what you learn here with 4hourbody and 4hourworkweek and you have the recipe for a good life.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|Characters were not clearly delineated from the first track of movies, which caused some confusion about who was who.  Most mainline characters were the same, but some differed or were new characters and that was unclear.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I like all of the Harry Bosch novels.  This one, The Black Box, was good but not as edgy as Connelly's other ones.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|the news feed needs to be fixed, shows only the first 10 posts and then only blue blocks which cant be accessed
B008VBYN80|4.0|So far, I'm having a great time building my town...The graphics are great and so far, the game is easy to play. The tutorial at the beginning is very helpful. form there, keep watching your energy so that you can get things done.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I read another amazing similar book [[ASIN:B00AKZWHQK Real Secrets to Get Your Financial Freedom Motivational Book (Real Secrets Of How To Get Financial Freedom and Become a Wealth Magnet)]]<br />that had incredible advice on breaking out the poverty mindset to reach a millionaire mindset and have great success<br /><br />I found the two books to really compliment each other<br />for state of mind and on to the millionaire path to success.  I found both books do and will help me gain massive success.<br />That being said....<br />I found this book to be an amazing piece of art. He put it together with such ease and grace making it so easy to understand yet straight to the point, no waffling.<br />He really shows and goes into how it's not by chance or luck to become a millionaire, how it's not only gifted to very few people or to those born into wealth but really explains deeply how everyone can and will become a millionaire it's just how we have set up out blueprint.<br />He explains why many people fail to succeed to success is because they haven't found the root cause to their pain. They haven't found why they are thinking and acting the way they are acting.<br />But as Harv says \\"Thoughts lead to Feelings - Feelings lead to Actions - Actions lead to Results\\" so the more we think about what we want, we are going to start feeling what it would be like and feel like, smell like etc, then those feelings won't just stay as feelings but will motivate us to actions in turn these actions will lead to MASSIVE RESULTS!
1571200851|5.0|I have been able to make some wonderful quilts with the techniques laid out in this book. It adds a whole new level to my quilts.
B009VB97EY|3.0|This movie wasn't as bad as I thought but there was some depth missing. All characters seem very superficial even though &#34;Mike&#34; and one or two other characters do not want to be as superficial as the others.<br />The movie ends rather abruptly but that was good thing because it just wasn't going anywhere. There is no doubt that this movie could have been a lot better with the great line-up of actors.<br />Nonetheless, the movie still managed to put some positive messages out there for the younger folks out there watching this and I think that it's worth watching at least once.<br />As a guy, I prefer watching Baywatch but I understand the hype that was created by the ladies about this movie.....I really can't hate on guys who watch their figure and have some skill.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|This is ok. Most mp3 cost more than 1 credit. would be ok if it was cheaper. Nothing else to say
B000FBFML6|5.0|I would recomend it to any who enjoys mystery and excitment. Robin Hobb books are all very well written and hard to put down untill you reach the end. I myself  wish she would continue the Farseer, Liveship, and Fool books.
6305428042|5.0|This movie has been one of my favorites since it came out. Kathy Najimy is one of my favorite actresses.
B009LRE040|5.0|I'm not a professional movie critic; I'm also not someone who analyzes movies to a painful detail, and neither am I a Batman fanboy, but this movie rocks! You will not be disappointed.<br />This is like &#34;The Avengers&#34; a great movie adaption of a successful comic. The difference is that this movie takes a little longer to unfold the story. Both movies are great.....scratch that....both movies are SUPERB in their own way.<br />If you like Batman, then you will have watched the previous movies and nothing will hinder you from watching this one if you haven't already.<br />If you don't like Batman, then you will get to like him when you watch this part or any other part of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboot. I'll admit that the first movie (Batman Begins) of the series was the slowest but it was still entertaining and worth watching.
B006HL9G10|5.0|I have used this program on my cell phone and wanted to download it to my kindle.  Would recommend this to anybody who is into meditation and wants a timer
159413586X|5.0|My book had a different cover, and since I ordered from England, color was spelled colour, and flavor, flavour, etc. but I don't care about that. Book was brand new, great read. I can't help but see our future in the Hunger Games trilogy. We are headed in that direction. I thought it wasn't fiction, it is future FACTion.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|While I loved the whole series, this was my favorite book of the trilogy. Captivating and hard to put down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read many reviews on this book and I loved it! I am the last of my friends to read it and I am glad they convinced me! A book you don't stop reading until the end.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Connelly always makes a Harry Bosch novel engaging, although I found the ending a bit anticlimatic. All in all a pleasurable read for Bosch fans.
0061992860|5.0|Great book actually and since it is small, in handbook format, it is easy to throw in a bug out bag, glovebox, purse, whatever.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great continuation to a great series. Can't wait to see the movie next year. The trilogy is great and can't wait for more.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|I love well-written and well-acted series that are effective at really putting you into the time period they are set in, and Mad Men fits that description. I didn't enjoy the story lines of Season 5 as much as I did the first four seasons, but it was still excellent, and I am hoping to see a Season 6 soon!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|A nice continuation of the Jack Ryan saga. Took a little while longer to get into than previous novels but a good read. Clancy (when writing solo) always delivers for me.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Great movie if you like movies with lots of music. Had some really funny moments as well.  Love Anna Kendrick's audition song \\"cups\\"
B003PIUBZS|5.0|It is sad that the actor who played Spartacus couldn't come back to this character. He was as rough as the character needed to be while still keeping you on his side and rooting for him all the way through the season.
B005PK553C|5.0|LOVE this series. Well-written, well-acted, and all kinds of creepy. I have to say Season 2 is much better in my opinion, as far as being way more creepy and scary, but you don't want to miss any of these if you enjoy this genre.
B007HACDLK|5.0|the last man by vince flynn is the best book i have read ;in quiet a while..one of those you don;t want to end.it had me from start to finish
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|...even though I'm a terrible artist ;-) Great time killer....highly recommend! Sign on with some FB friends or create a game with a stranger. Online pictionary personified!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The characters capture your attention and imagination. Some good plot twists and a wonderful way to end the trilogy. Can't wait for the movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great, great series! Often I think a series starts out strong and then sort of peters out, but not this one. I LOVED Season 1, Season 2 was even better, I cannot wait to watch Season 3-- and I am already worrying about whether or not there will be a Season 4!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am a Bingo lover................and now a Bingo BLITZ lover!  I have spent many, many hours playing this app and still can't get enough of it!  One can &#34;chit/chat&#34; while playing.............resulting in my having met some of the nicest people, people with big hearts and kindness in their souls (something that is on a downward spin it seems, these days)!  The extra entertainment &#34;gaming&#34; of New York, Madrid, Spain, etc., included in this app is an interesting addition and adds an additional enjoyment as we play Bingo!  Once again, I must shout to the roof tops...............THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!!!!  Your the best!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I like this one it helps me sleep and I love to hear the water and cat purring great job
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the trilogy and this was a great end to the series. A little predictable but overall a great purchase.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it, I seem to relax some playing it. godd way to spend a little time.when just sitting, at home
B002M9WW30|5.0|The Rocky collection is great as it stands but I got this after reading the reviews on the Blu-ray version and I agree with the other reviews regarding Blu-ray. The sound, picture quality and extras makes this a well worth purchase.
0316069434|5.0|Connelly didn't disappoint on this one. Good story line but predictable toward the end. But a good read none the less. Recommend!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The whole trilogy was a great read. I bought this one for my kindle without really knowing what it was about. Definitely caught me off guard but I couldn't stop reading it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|another royal pain in the ass trying to get My personal facebook to come up on my kindel, always goes somewhere else, A PAIN
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I love point and click games and this one is pretty awesome. The only reason I didn't. give it 5 stars is because you have to walk back and forth ALOT.  However,  for the money,  Tesla is a winner! Unique puzzles with hints available but you get the option to only open specific sections of hints depending on how difficult it is or isn't for you. More games should take note of this.  Bottom line is Definitely buy and play Tesla's Electric Mist.......come on would I steer ya wrong???
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I had moments reading this book where I would literally have to stop and go, oh my gosh!  Dr. Alexander's experience comes across as emotional, honest, and sincere!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So much better than the movie (and the movie was great in its own right). A wonderful start to a great trilogy
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Once I cracked  this  book open I couldn't put it down such a heart wrenching account of battle and account of how much operation Redwings went down..... And how it made a retire navy man feel honored to have served as a support tech for the special boat team and SEAL Teams for 10 years of my navy career
B00AGH5LF6|5.0|I loved watching Home Alone I & II when I was a kid and couldn't resist buying it to watch with my nieces this year for the holidays.  Home Alone II is basically the same as the first movie --Kid gets left all by himself, he lives the sweet life for a little bit, he meets an older person who helps him make an important decision and visa versa, and then he beats up the two goons quite spectacularly. I'm not rating it 5/5 because it has some amazing, spectacular plot or anything--it gets a 5/5 rating because my two nieces laughed themselves silly while the goons got pummeled. :)<br /><br />*A warning to more conservative parents - there is a scene where he watches an old b/w movie (in both of the Home Alone's, actually) where a person is shot. Nothing gory but definitely scary for younger ones.<br /><br />-Also, I purchased the digital version. Amazon streamed the movie perfectly.
B00866JL96|5.0|Her photograph saves his life and he saves her life after he finds her.  The added element of her brother dying saving his fellow soldier and Zac's character witnessing his heroic action, so that she could come to peace with his death was very sensitive.
B000641D2Y|5.0|One of my husbands favorite Christmas movies. Got it for him for a present. He was thrilled and glad to have it.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Yes, this was my wife's choice, but I tend to end up liking them anyway.  I like Tommy Lee Jones and although this was seriousl it had funny parts and sections I think most couples could relate.  You get into a pattern and is becomes normal and you have no idea how to change it and open back up.<br /><br />Well worth watching.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I watch it every year. I like comedy.i also like movies that are just fun, without any sentimental attempts to try and add  seriousness to the show.
B003L20IHE|5.0|I loved this movie.  Sad in the beginning but it does a fine job of showing how family members can move passed the tragedy, and honor the person's life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even better than the movie and I didn't think that that was possible!! Great book and I can't wait to read the next!
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|Yeah, it wasn't the Arnold version on mars, but had a good flow and connection to it.  I liked it.  I did like some of the connections to Arnold's version such as the lady he portrayed on Mars who said, &#34;two weeks&#34;.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Great old movie.  It's a keeper.  A movie little kids will love and want to watch over and over again.
B007N31YH0|5.0|I loved the ending of this movie.  it keeps you on the edge of your sit until the last moment.
0307592731|5.0|This is one of those stories that makes you admire the woman and also wonder how in the world she ever made it. With no real experience for such a trip and to complete it is baffling!<br /><br />The book was listed as very good but looked brand new. Shipping was great too!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|My wife and I started watching this series only a year ago and caught up via buying the seasons off Amazon.  They are just really funny and sure beats all the cops/robbery and stupid reality TV out there.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to enact change in the way work gets accomplished! A really fresh viewpoint.
B00330UFQS|4.0|It's their old stuff but nice to hear.  I have always liked vocal harmony, like Eagles and Journey.  I will be buying more of their music soon.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fantastic, heart wrenching, not a HEA but a great forever! I couldn't put this book down...read it in one sitting. Absolutely wonderful!!
B004HD61KE|4.0|It was a very entertaining book to read! The story is credible and tangles into may funs situations. I like the author's  historical facts. It makes this book a learning experience.
B001MRMRS8|1.0|Traviata is my favourite Verdi opera and I have gathered at home quite a collection of cds and dvds with some of the greatest Violettas: Callas, Gheorghiu, Sutherland, Moffo, etc. I bought this item based on amazon reviews, but the fact of the matter is that I regret having bought it: I like the tenor and the baritone, but Netrebko did not convince me as Violetta.<br /><br />- act I: her coloratura is barely satisfactory and not what one would expect from a regular singer at the MET...<br />- act II: her Amami Alfredo was weak; she went off tune rather often;<br />- act III: I got no sense of the frailty and tragedy of Violetta - she failed to convince dramatically.<br /><br />So if you are a big fan of Villazon, you may want to buy this dvd for his good Alfredo; but if you are like me and you can't imagine a good La Traviata with a mediocre Violetta, save your money.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Hilarious blend of characters, remarkably good singing, and less raunchy than many such movies of this genre.  Great musical fun.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another of Nelson DeMille's great nail-biting adventures!<br /><br />I find myself laughing out loud at his never-ending wit, which only adds to the fun.
B009SKPVO8|4.0|This strap is easier to use than the neck strap that came with my Canon Rebel T3. It screwed in securely and I felt confident it could not be unscrewed accidently.<br /><br />I wore it for the first time on the busiest day of the year in Williamsburg, Virginia. With \\"bumper to bumper\\" foot traffic, I returned to my neck strap. The camera hanging at my hip/side seemed to be bumping into everything.<br /><br />When I wore it in the country to take landscape pictures, it was quite convenient.<br /><br />The quality is excellent but I haven't found anything that is truly as comfortable as using a point and shoot. For this type of product, this is a high quality product.
B000F3T3CS|1.0|L'elisir d'amore is a light and funny opera, so a recording of it would make a good gift for somebody who is relatively new to opera. This particular recording won't make a great gift though. I think Anna's timbre is too dark and Slavic for this light role. The main problem is that her coloratura is so weak that she fails to be a vocally credible Adina. I grant that she has good chemistry with Villazon and that her acting is decent. But opera is music first and acting second. Musically and technically, Anna is only a mediocre Adina, and no amount of acting can make one overlook this basic problem. Villazon delivers a good Una furtiva lacrima, but there's no sufficient reason for buying this recording, when there are many others of better quality out there (for a great Adina, see Angela Gheorghiu in the Lyon Opera recording; for a great Rodolfo, Pavarotti remains unmatched).
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have Evernote on kindle, laptop, and my phone. Intuitive, well designed, full of great features, super useful, and totally free. Can't beat it.
B003VTZTU8|4.0|The subject is covered well and the material is accurately presented.  The writing style is fair.  As a medical educator, I find myself regularly emphasizing the type of information discussed in this book. It should be read by all who select and transmit news stories to the public by any media.  The poor understanding of science, the scientific method, and statistical analysis of scientific research by the public, and unfortunately, many in science, makes it even more important that the media present material with painful accuracy.  Unfortunately this is so often not the case today. The massive amount of poorly reported scientific information in the media today, four years after publication of this book indicates a continuing need for education on this subject. This subject should be an important part of the curriculum for the education of journalists. Editors and broadcast media managers should read this book three times - the message - accuracy trumps flashy and sensational headlines and sound bites.
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|Can not get it to play on kindle or tablet.  Otherwise may have liked it.  I am a fan of Star Wars.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|The only problem I have is that I can't open a PDF file from an external website.  Not sure I am making it clear.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|I don't have TV so, I hadn't seen the show. It's my boyfriends absolute favorite, though! When he moved in with me I started buying him the DVDs so he wouldn't have to be without it. I started watching it with him and now, I love it, too!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really enjoy playing Bingo Blitz, it's fun and I always strive for the &#34;Bingo&#34;.  I highly recommend this to my friends
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|One of the most boring books I've ever read.<br />I Could not finish this book. It started out interesting but later on it became too boring . It became a history lesson in addition to the heroine being very whiny, weak and dependent . Although she had So much potential.<br />In addition, there were too many silly details in the book, the yoga, the rowing, the food they ate and what they smelled like.<br />What a waste of time!!!!
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|This show totally takes me back to my highschool years. Product was in great condition and arrived in a timely manor. I love this show and I highly recommend it!!!!!!
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I really like this movie! My only issue is that there are NO bonus features! No deleted scenes, no alternate endings, no behind-the-scenes... I miss that stuff! I wish I had got the special edition...
B0000025DV|5.0|I had been looking for this album since my original blue vinyl album was lost in a house move.  It's one of the great albums of all time, in my opinion.  I love ELO and Jeff Lynne.  Thanks for your good service.
B007THA4FI|2.0|It's a slice of life not to my taste.  Obviously she is a talented writer however I kept waiting for an interesting story line, I never found it to the end.  Sorry.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I am totally hooked on the Shadow Fever series and the interesting tension between the two main characters.  This book doesn't dissapoint.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it, and I can not wait to watch the movie! Hopefully it is as good at the book.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Amazing prices for such a great trilogy! comes with 5 discs (3 movie and 2 bonus material) plus a 65 page book with detailed photos from all 3 movies. also comes with the UV digital copies! It would make a great gift for any movie lover or batman fan. Price is almost to hard to pass up.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I could barely put it down, and now I can't wait to move on to the next one in the series.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Ok. Im a huge fan of this show.  I bought season 5 first....had to keep going until I have them all. Got season 2 here.....just ordered seasons 1 and 4 yesterday....4 shipped supposed to get it soon. Anyway.....I watch this show in a different style than everybody else. Because in my opinion every episode can stand on its own.  Whether its just one victim he gets....or its his complicated life.  I watch it that style. Ill watch say an episode from season 5...then watch one from another season.  Ok....on to my point.....they probaly did that to preview season 7.  There are ways around it.  Ill write another review to tell you how.  Im personaly looking forward to getting this set.  Once I see it Ill review it. I promise. But please no more complaints....even though they are beyond justified.

B007V65R54|4.0|very good insights .... is a bit verbose at times .... but definitely worth a read as the big picture ideas are insightful
1596912375|5.0|It's always amazing to me the price you pay for many very good books and novels online. They are either new or like new. It's a great way to save money and still get great books.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Reading this book shows that you don't need all the material things in the world to find peace and happiness.<br />Nature is a great healer.We need to slow down and enjoy nature.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Dolphin browser is an excellent piece of software and gives better alternatives than the current silk browser used on the kindle fire.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best of the MIB movies. Story line was fantastic. The acting was wonderful. Will Smith was hysterical as always. Josh Brolin was amazing as the younger K. A definite must see, you won't be disappointed!
B007SOQBCM|1.0|If you want to watch Twitch.tv at a lower quality than you are used to and don't like to chat, then this is the app for you!  I can't find any reason to use this app since I can watch Twitch streams in higher quality by going directly to the website using my phone/tablet web browser, and when I go directly to the website I can use ALL of the features of Twitch such as chat, the Twitch app strips away every feature of the site.  It just doesn't make sense to use the app, waste of space on my memory card.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|My first encounter with Tim Ferriss and I couldn't be more pleased.  I love how he makes a cookbook so much more.  I initially bought this on some recommendation on a paleo blog while searching for paleo recipes.... and thought it may be good to add some more recipes to my arsenal.  When I got the book, on first glance... I was all... WFT is this?  This isn't a cookbook!  And for the price I paid, I was initially going to return.  But that night I started reading it and was HOOKED!  Sooooo glad I didn't act on my initial reaction.  Bonus is that I live in Marin County (Tim hails from SF) and there are a number of local references which makes the journey that is his book even more enjoyable.  It's opened up my mind to a lot of things, currently I'm trying to figure out how to deconstruct French (after being married to a French girl for 13 years), and my spice cabinet has grown tremendously and I frickin' LOVE eggs, tumeric and tarragon in the morn.  I've got a few other things I've added to my need to get list, from a dutch oven (no, not that one) to a home generator.  You so need to buy this f-in book and read it.  It could save your life!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I do like it... I don't really like that so many of the episodes depend upon luck rather than skill. I do like the way that you need to think out most of the action.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|False advertising at it's best, trailer was completely misleading.  1/4 way through the movie I stopped caring about the douchebag characters, 1/2 way through i was ready to just turn it off.  Apparently Oliver Stone's past his prime...
B00846REIS|5.0|Best book after fifty shades, if you are looking to keep reading on the same track with similar emotions, going in to part two.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love this movie, and just let my son watch it for the first time (he's 6), and he laughed through the whole thing. It takes a lot to warm the cockles of my black, shriveled heart, but this does it every time.
B007SGM084|1.0|This is such a poorly written adult version of the Twilight series. It is so ridicuoously unbelievable. I am sorry that I wasted my money.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This Nerf gun is awesome! Good quality for both kids and adults. Shoots way better than the non- Elite Nerf guns. Will definitely last longer than just Christmas day.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I'd read the book already; and by then, it was out of the local theaters, so I bought a DVD, as it was at least 5 dollars more in the stores.  So great!  It was pretty faithful to the book, I think, which is a good benchmark for any movie based off literature.
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|I overclocked this processor on the stock heat sink and fan combo to 4.0 GHz while maintaining temps &#60;70.  I dialed it back to 3.8 on stock voltage until I decide on a cooling path.  CPU performs as expected.  Integrated HD 4000 graphics works well enough for Steam, light video editing with software encoding, and standard desktop duties.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cost/Performance ratio<br />Capable overclockable CPU<br /><br />Cons:<br />No hyperthreading, but you already know that<br />Ivy Bridge gets a little warmer than Sandy Bridge but can also handle up to 105 degrees C

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|STOP WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW AND GET THIS BOOK!!!!  YOU MUST READ THIS!!!!<br /><br />I am pretty sure I am still breathless after finishing this book less than eight hours ago.  I am beyond captivated.  My heart is fluttering a hundred miles a minute, and I cannot stop thinking about how Holder swept Sky off her feet.<br /><br />Sky is not your everyday, seventeen yr old, girl next door.  She is adopted, home schooled, and since she can remember has never owned a piece of electronic equipment in her home.  She has a BFF, who lives next door and her name is Six...yes just like Six from Blossom..too cute for words these two girls are.  They have been inseparable since Six moved next door four yrs earlier.  Karen (Sky's mom) is very lenient, except for the whole electronics situation...she does not have a curfew, she can swear, and can have boyfriends.<br /><br />Six and Sky use their windows as forms of going to and from each others homes.  Six is BOY CRAZY!  MEGA MEGA BOY CRAZY!  So once Six gets a new boyfriend, Sky gets a new boy to make out with.  She doesn't do anything beyond that, but the thing is....she doesn't feel anything.  She is completely numb to these boys.  Sky doesn't know if this a normal thing or not.....<br /><br />Since Sky is home schooled,  she doesn't know any of the other kids her age.  By chance she meets some guy by the name of Holder at the grocery store.  But after seeing Holder, she is instantly attracted to him, and even has butterflies in her belly.  She have never felt this way before...she is totally consumed by him.  So from this moment on, both of their lives are about to change forever.<br /><br />Holder is the typical hotty, with a side of bad boy, who has brilliant dimples (that are lickable), and downright heart melting adorable.  He has a bit of a past, that he won't let go of....but don't we all?  He sees Sky, and knows he needs her.  She instantly intrigues him.  She holds him like a deer caught in the headlights.  There is something about this girl, that is making him completely crazy.<br /><br />By coincidence they literally run into each other, the next day after briefly meeting at the grocery store.  From there they start to sort of build a friendship, slowly but surely.  Sky has never let a guy into her life, into heart, or into her head ever...so this is completely new to her.  Holder has had his fair share of girls in his past, but Sky changes him.  Sky is afraid that once they share their first kiss, she won't be able to feel....well let's just say that she felt everything.  Their bond is amazing, so beautiful, and so strong.<br /><br />But all good things must come to an end....unfortunately.  The past always comes back and bites us in the ass.  And that is exactly what happens....Whatever was forming between these two wonderful individuals starts to slowly dissipate.  Can it resurrect itself?  Will love conquer all?  Can Sky see through the tears?  Do Holder and Sky have enough willpower to withstand the hurt and pain?<br /><br />This book goes above and beyond the call of duty.  I had goosebumps throughout this book.  At about 66%, the crapola hits the fan...and things get way REAL!  It was intense, and endearing.  Holder is amazing.  He is the boyfriend that any girl wants.  Sky is a beautiful soul.  She has a heart of gold, she always sees the good in people.<br /><br />This is not a 5 star book, no way.  This book is like 1000 star book.  If I could rate it that much, I totally would.  Colleen is a super genius when it comes to writing.  If you have not read her other books, you must.  Slammed and Point of Retreat are MUST READS too!  I shed a few tears throughout this book.  Again this is a must read...ASAP!<br /><br />(I recommend this book to anyone over the age of 17, due to the content.  It is definitely not suitable for anyone younger than that, Colleen has said this numerous times!)There is something about this girl, that is making him completely crazy.<br /><br />By coincidence they literally run into each other, the next day after briefly meeting at the grocery store.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|I can watch anything by Chris Nolan so I am a bit biased here. But the movie is so great. The score is fantastic and the IMAX scenes look really good on bluray.

B007THA4FI|5.0|Being that Harry Potter was the definition of my childhood and I still carry it with me to this day, of course I quick to jump on &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34;. Not entirely what I expected from Miss Rowling. Not only did I love the story, but it showed me that J.K. can write just as easily for adults as she can for children. Though I think this only narrowly missed the margin of most f-bombs dropped ever, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend this to anyone that won't get confused with multiple plot lines.
B009K0P10K|4.0|my wife loves it ! I like it too and watch it with her it has a little of everything, action, drama and suspence.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|I wasn't sure what I would encounter as there was a bit of controversy with regards to operational security. I looked for that - and didn't find anything of particular note, so I'm not sure why this was supposed to have been an issue.<br /><br />As my intro says - an easy read - it was. No spectacular prose, just a simple narrative that takes you on this man's journey from SEAL to DEVGRU SEAL, some of what he encountered in operations in Afghanistan (and a bit of legitimate criticism on the impact increasingly restrictive ROE's had) and the raid that got Bin Laden.<br /><br />If you enjoy non-fiction military by those who live it - this is fairly light fare. But i still enjoyed it
B008OURHPY|5.0|Luv her voice. She is special. Touching, beautiful lyrics.  She is force to be reckon with. A star is born!
B009ZE27US|5.0|its not supposed to work, half of you are 8 and 9 years old so I wouldn't. think you would know that, you shouldn't have a smartphone ipod or tablet anyway, just leave. 5 stars because all the dumb people are giving un needed rating

B002G1YPH0|5.0|When it became evident that my motherboard was fried I started searching for new components for a new build in my HAF 912 case. Warning - this cooling system is large!<br /><br />The included instructions are unhelpful but Cooler Master did post their installation video on you tube and is very helpful.  The unit comes with one fan and a small tube of thermal paste and everything you need to mount this as well as adding another fan (additional fan not included) if you so choose.<br /><br />The fan mounting brackets are tool-less, and comes off easy enough (which yo will need to do in order to secure this to the board. Put the thermal paste on the socket cover, position the back plate, remove the sticker from the cooling tubes, adjust and slide the top bracket into place and screw it down. Reinstall the fan and done. Doesn't take a lot of time and is readily adaptable to a number of makers chips and sockets.<br /><br />What surprised me was how cool and quiet everything is now. Cooler in fact, than my liquid cooling system I had had previously and wouldn't adapt to the new socket (thankfully). You can't go wrong with such an inexpensive and effective cooling system (unless your case is too small)
B008478VE8|5.0|You should definitely read this book! And its free to everyone too! a very important book to read. read it! luv it!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love the hidden objects game where you need to use the things you find to help you solve other parts of the game.  other games I have paid more for hasn't been as good.  looking forward to similar games like this.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I've not read any of Ms. Day's books before the Crossfire series.  She grabed my interest with the first book and I can't wait for the next in the series.
0307887448|5.0|I'll keep this short and simple because there are enough reviews on this book that touch on all of the geek/sci-fi/80's/etc. references.<br /><br />I am not a science fiction reader, writer or a huge fan of the genre. However, I appreciate it and find myself open-minded to recommendations from friends. This book, on a recommendation, became one of my favorites of the year. It reads at an amazingly quick pace, is funny, thoughtful and really appeals to the kid inside all of us. I was born in the mid 80's so some of the references needed a Wikipedia companion, but I never felt like I was out of the loop or lost in translation. Overall, this is one of the best debut novels in a long, long time.<br /><br />I recommend everyone pick it up for a really fun ride. Can't wait to see how they pull this off on the big screen!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|LOVED it, totally fantastic and definitely a good buy,  make a good purchase with this one and you'll be pleased  a definite necessity
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead 3 is awesome and I hope the series is able to keep going into season 4, 5 etc...
B0085MNZ66|5.0|If you like games that make you think, you'll like this one.  It starts out easy, as you learn how colors match up.  I got this game for my kids, and then had to get it for my tablet, too.  Hours of fun and puzzle solving with a few correct answers.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|Was a little slow for me, I like having a full screen and then having to get them all gone so its not high on my list.

B009VSW15Y|3.0|The video camera on this was great... then after like a week it stopped completely ugghh don't. Buy this if you wanna you it for videoing
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you don't mind starting a new world every time you play the game, you can just get the free version.  While not quite as awesome as the computer version, this game is just as addictive.  Knowing Mojang, I would get the game, and reap the benefits of all future updates as they make this game better and better.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I loved this series,  I wish there would be one more to complete the series for the aftermath of everyone's lives such as cole.  what happens to him thats the question i need answered

B00A0SQBDM|4.0|So far, the free trial was enough to get me to pay for the game. Hasn't bored me yet! The graphics are cool, and I love playing in my kindle!

B006OEPITO|2.0|India fascinates me.  I've never met a person from India who I have not considered a decent human being - I'm sure there are bad people from India - I simply haven't met one.  This book captivated me for the first several chapters, lending a first hand viewpoint to a culture that is alien to many americans.  And then about half way through, devolved from explaining the philosophy and religion that India has to offer - to a man spending his life contemplating his navel.  I guess I'm just a dumb hick; I found The Old Man and the Sea a boring diatribe; and even decades after having suffered through the agonizing trance-like boredom it created - still have no idea why it's considered a &#34;classic&#34;.<br /><br />If you like it, good for you.  For me, what started out as a remarkable view into a foreign culture, soon turned into a book I simply lost interest in - I cannot bring myself to finish it - and you can't make me.
B00571F26Y|5.0|We have eliminated wheat from our diet, and are losing weight, and seeing other benefits, as predicted.  We love this book.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland was a very stay at home and watch it you cannot get away<br />from it once you start watching it very exciting for someone who likes<br />a good good series this is the one to buy I hope they continue in filming<br />this one I don't think that anyone will be disappointed in Homeland
B009VLXMJA|5.0|This is for sure Taylor, which granted she can sometimes be semi formulaic in that the songs are similarly themed. However, she sure changes things up and give some rock to the pop. I have a hard time picking my fave... I seriously love and feel nostalgic about 22, since it's been almost 10 years since that age for me. Stay Stay Stay never fails to make me chuckle when she giggles at the end of the track. I love the songs that are duets with Ed Sheeran... they are BEAUTIFUL. Check this album out.
B000A6T294|5.0|This is a good star trek movie of all time, and I love all of the graphics in the movie.
B005XLN97M|4.0|My daughter is now into Barbies.  She has Barbie doing the same things around the Barbie 2-Story Beach House that my daughter does around our house.  The house has plenty of different items to keep her interested in playing.  It was a marvel of packaging engineering, and the product was very easy to set up.  Note, there are a lot of little pieces (Barbie cups, plates) that are fun for my 3-year-old and dangerous near infants.  Overall, a fun toy we recommend.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This was a really good book ! MY favorite part was when Greg started screaming because of the red dot on the girl's chin when they were dancing :) hahaha that was the best part. This is a good book but not the best of the series
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed this book, not something I would normally read, however very well written! I enjoyed book one the most!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is the best movie of all time. The spaceships, and the action, and the aliens, and other stuff. thank you.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|While not Jane Austen's most popular novel, this story of longing, regret and love, full with the satire and keen observations of the social graces of the period, is one of my personal favorites.  The heroine Anne Elliot is an interesting lady caught in a times where women had very little independence and means to pursue their own happiness, and where family connections dictated most social interactions.  Her journey to reclaim her love and more important her sense of self is very heartwarming.  And her dashing Captain Wentworth, while still a pround gentleman finally lets his own emotions towards Anne steer him, and her to a happy conclusion.  I am great fan of romantic literature, and Jane Austen does not dissapoint.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|While Cline does not produce the most beautiful prose I have ever read, he successfully creates a harsh, overpopulated, dystopian future that I would totally enjoy living in.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book and suggest it to anyone. Someone told me not to read this but now I wish I had.
B009GX6600|5.0|Love NCIS and the fact it's available for streaming on Amazon.  We are able to watch this on several devices from large screen to laptop.  Excellent!
B006H5120E|5.0|Watched the movie in 3D on a big screen in the dark... really liked the 3D, better than I thought it would be. It greatly added to the story. Still a well told film with excellent acting and beautiful cinematography.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|Love this song great quality and a fan of Fun. No hassel and easy to get. Happy with this ha
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box is one of the best for Harry Bosch and Michael Connelly. He keep this series fresh & keeps you guessing. Cant wait  until the next one. This is a book  you hate to finish because whatever you read next will not be as good.
B003Y5H5FQ|4.0|We have a large 3D screen. Turned out all the lights, cranked up the surround sound -- we sat back and got lost in an entertaining little horror movie remake. Was more serious than the original, more CGI pronounced. Just a tad bit darker image quality than the original -- but in the dark, effective!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Love this song great quality and a fan of Fun. No hassel and easy to get. Happy with this ha
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love Game of Thrones from HBO, and decided to read the book.  The book does explain certain things that the show leaves out and you get a better understanding.  This is a great addition to your library.  Enjoy!!

1451675046|3.0|Dawkins believes in magic, God doesn't work with occult powers, He produces miracles. We truly worship a God of Miracles who split the Red Sea and spoke the universe into existence according to Genesis 1:1 [which debunks evolution by the way]. So yes, what Dawkins is implying with the title of His book is that Dawkins worldview is magical or illusionary or a trick his playing on his followers. Dawkins has not even invented this magical worldview of evolution, nor Darwin, that lie comes from the serpent [satan] who tempted Eve with the saying `Yeah hath God said' [In Genesis 2] making man the final authority in the universe and thus humanism was birthed!  Evolution is just that, it's a fanciful fairytale or a magical lie from the serpent [satan].
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|It is a mystery story.  Like many mysteries, a little hard to follow at times.  But it does its job and keeps you guessing.
B0080K3G4O|2.0|I bought this book based on a WSJ excerpt/review and to be honest, I was quite disappointed.  Not being a big fan of eternal optimism, I was intrigued by the concept of the book, unfotunately the concept is better than the execution.  There are some useful insights sprinkled throughout but there is also a LOT of time spent exploring Buddahism, and other avenues of mystical nonsense (like \\"How do I Know That I Actually Exist?).<br /><br />Give me more pragmatic ideas and skip the Eastern religion aspect (or be honest and let potential buyers know what's inside).
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|You can't go wrong with this Batman sequel. It is well worth the time and money! I really enjoyed the new cast additions.
B000T46O52|5.0|The story line makes you feel so much for the guy getting beat down by society, but it makes you feel so good inside when justice is finally served in the end.  Very powerful, very poignant movie.

B0085YNML2|5.0|I only downloaded this game based on reviews.  I surprising like the game.  Its a typical level based game that requires you to get three stars on each level.  Very colorful, which is why two year likes it, and very addicting.  I played around with it just before bed and found myself playing for about 40 minutes.  Simple, addicting and easy to understand.  Nice job!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I downloaded it for my 7 year old grandson on my tablet, he has a ball playing it. Loves it! Even myself I enjoy it, and it helps passes time.
B007TK77QE|3.0|It took me a long time - most of the book - to get into it. My fault - I was expecting a fantasy genre. This is more real and closer to the bone. How people's greed/arrogance/self-absorption can lead to so many disasters.<br />I did cry in the end, so the writing did penetrate. But left me feeling low.<br /><br />If you are looking for Harry Potter, or an adult Harry Potter or any fantasy. This is not for you.<br /><br />This is a book about the middle class thinking / wishing they are upper class and not wanting to have to deal with the dregs and other lower class society. How bad situations can go worse.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Imagine that if Tolkien had written The Fellowship from different perspectives and we had a chapter told by Gimli the Dwarf. That is what Martin does in A Dance with Dragons and the entire A Song of Ice and Fire. Even the villains get a chance to tell how they arrive at horrendous outcomes. This is another masterpiece.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Time passer, not a fast game, but fun! Reminds me when we use tp play them at the fair years ago!
0880793082|1.0|This deck is extremely lightweight. The cards will bend at nothing. it is not the original Crowley deck either - it has been updated. Do yourself a favor and get a different deck.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I bought this game after getting the other one free. This game is very good. It doesn't have a timer and you will like it. I really like the way it tells you how much of the game has been played after each chapter.The graphics are great,and the story line has your guessing who did it. I do want to say that I would want the next chapter when it comes out. Any one that loves hidden object games will love this, and the price is not bad.'m

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I had my doubts when the word came out that this show would have a woman playing Watson. Well, the whole thing is brilliant! I have a gig every Thursday night now, so I purchase each episode here on Amazon for streaming. It's a couple bucks a week but so what -- It's Sherlock Holmes!<br /><br />Glad to see such a rekindling of interest in Sherlock & Watson: Robert Downey's movies (2nd one was pretty much a bore, though), the BBC series, Hugh Ashton's Deed Box stories, and now this show.<br /><br />Can't get enough Sherlock!<br />Uke Jackson
B0001I562I|4.0|The movie is an old favorite of mine, but I've discovered that old VHS movies that have been copied onto DVD, even by a reputable company, will often have glitches on the DVD version. There were some skips in sound, and pixilation, but after a while it cleared up.<br /><br />But it still is nice to have this movie in my DVD collection.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Such a cool little anthology. Nice presentation, the book has some great pictures and info in it, and WOW!!!!!!! The Blu-ray edition of the original movie was worth the price alone! If you're a fan on the franchise, you owe it to yourself to see it the way it was meant to be seen! If you don't, may a facehugger come padding into your bedroom at night to perpetuate the species ;)

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|this series had me riveted from the first moments of season one and continues to thrill with each episode of season two.  It's been ages since I've felt inclined to gnaw my fingernails out of nervousness while watching a tv show--this one brings out the seven-year-old scaredy cat in me.  Keep the good stuff coming!!
0385335997|5.0|I love this author, I love this book, I love everything about the Outlander series!! Def must read the series!!
B000M39HB8|5.0|.. loved it..it is one of my favorite all time Christmas movies...hasn't been on TV lately and it is a must see every Christmas for us..
B0052RDHTM|5.0|What a book!  I bought the Kindle edition because it was so long and I didn't want to read the paperback edition in  small print.  (I love to use larger print on my Kindle!) Unfortunately, there were so many characters in the beginning, I had to make a list of them for myself to remember who was who.  Which was fine.  The characters were listed at the end.  Not much good for a Kindle reader.  I usually will not pay more than $9.99 so I was eagerly waiting for this to come down in price. It did.  Now  I can't wait til the second book of the trilogy to come down in price too!
B005URRCUY|5.0|Like a mix up of all the best raw rock of the 60's and 70's collide with Jack White's Raconteur's!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love Angry Birds and I love Star Wars.  This is a fun game with new birds and more challenges.  Enjoy!
B007FG9LIE|1.0|A total waste of time. If you can make it to the end you feel cheated, no resolution, no point
B007PKSN6Q|3.0|I like the music, but I would have prefered the original artist instead of the cast.  Still I like the music selection and the cast does a good job.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Having lost my mother, father and 29 year old sister to cancer...and, having shared those last months of their lives, the reviews I read sparked my interest.  I am glad I read this book.  It was very bittersweet.  John Green gets it.  I insisted that all of the counselors and other cancer support folks at the Center for Building Hope in Sarasota, Florida read this book.<br />The book made me sad...very sad...but, it was a very rich read.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|This movie is so cute. I could watch it over and over again. It's a fun story and fun to watch at any time.
0060599847|5.0|Great, great, great life-changing book. Love the audio version, especially. Worth whatever it costs. I'm giving the book as gifts to everyone I know. Greta online resources form Jack Canfield as well.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Love all the sounds, was surprised to find Train 1 the MOST relaxing.  I purchased it for the beach sounds, the variety and sound quality is great.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Mitch Rapp is one hard nose SOB who doesn't quit until he gets to the &#34;Last Man&#34;. The good guys always win!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|It is speed learning for anything you want out of life,I also learned to make a great oso buco and friends w<br /> Were .amazed
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from Ted, but it actually had a cute story line along with being really funny!  I would definitely recommend this movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you like playing bingo, you will love Bingo Blitz. In fact, the game can become addictive. The game is fun and challenging.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I definitely enjoyed watching the movie, but the story line was kind of like a less-good version of Coyote Ugly.  I would still watch it again because Channing Tatum looks very nice.
B000I2IP2K|5.0|Thank God they met!! Their combined cranial humor is PERFECT! Their wit and silliness ... their costumes and skits are hilarious!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|One of the best movies this year. Christopher Nolan teaming again with Christian Bale to bring us the magic that started a few years ago with Batman Begins. You have got to see it to believe it. The Nolan batman trilogy is highly recommended, go out and buy it now.
B0085YNML2|3.0|after about 40 min fighting with amazons stupid app, finally downloading the game... it would only freeze and crash. thx for the free app?
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Even the most sexually driven person could not keep up with nor satisfy Eva.  Beyond unrealistic even for this type of fiction.  The sex @ a concert is not in character with a character like Gideon.  He's too private & classy to do something for base in public.  The withholding of an orgasm in the car to get the truth from Eva was so far over the top that as a reader, I just started skipping over it.  The beyond sanity sex detracted from any plot that might have been developing.  With all of her caring, she carelessly does things destructive to this fragile relationship.  Beyond juvenile.  We expect flawed characters but not morons.  I really wanted to like this book.  Hope the author reads the 1 & 2 star reviews.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I really like the DVD except it was far to short. I thought it would have all the songs that the CD had but the DVD only had 3 of them but my favorite Lucky that Way was on the DVD. I could listen to that song for weeks straight.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Been listening to Deftones all my life and just keep lovin the music more as time goes by. Love koi no yokan. But, I still pray Chi gets better to make his come back and make the group whole again.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|MAN!!!!! I love the Harry Potter books and movies. They certainly live up to my expectations!! I hope that you are seriously considering this purchase!! You will not be dissapointed!
B00003CX97|5.0|The acting in this movie was great and a very good presentation of what did happen in building of the bridge.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|MAN!!!!! I love the Harry Potter books and movies. They certainly live up to my expectations!! I hope that you are seriously considering this purchase!! You will not be dissapointed!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love this game, although the tiles are a little small and hard to see on the kindle.<br /><br />It can be addictive so watch out!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am a Jane Austen die-hard and even though this is not one of her books or movies I felt like it was pretty close! The characters and love story was the best. Truly a unique experience.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Amazingly well written book. Fully developed with so many details. It feels like you're living the moment like you are actually in Bombay. It's an exciting book makes you want to read more and more. I felt a lot of feeling when I was reading the book. I'm really glad that I read this book. I fully recommend it.
B0015AARJI|1.0|This is not a Sony Product.<br />Crappy finish, matte vs, shiny black.<br />Buttons seem to act stick, will hold the left direction after you stop pushing the button.<br />It still works but it's annoying, and not cheap enough to justify the difference between an ACTUAL SONY PRODUCT...
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Great movie it was an eye opener and would like all my friends to see it. Discusting how they handle our food sources
B007RTAR64|5.0|This is really an excellent replica of the female heroine Katniss from the Hunger Games. The toy is durable and very realistic. Will provide hours of entertainment for your little one.
B009A9SULS|2.0|Having owned the Kindle (w/Keyboard) for several years, I was starting to look into getting my hands on a small, pocket sized eReader. By chance, the Kobo Mini was just about to release in the US within the week, and my local Best Buy would be receiving them. So I pre-ordered after reading the scant number of reviews and user videos.<br /><br />The Kobo Mini is fairly pricey at retail, but I will go ahead and say right now that if the price were cheaper (used/refurb/discount) it may become something worth looking at as something to /add/ to your reading materials.<br /><br />However, right now I almost feel buyer's remorse for being an early adopter for pocket-sized eReaders. The Kobo Mini has many flaws, which I will try to list out very briefly.<br /><br />- Ghosting: As you flip through pages, you will start to see lots of ghosting problems. I set my refresh rate to every 3 pages, but the edges sometimes have issues.<br />- Screen Sensitivity: It's difficult to tell how sensitive the touch function of the screen is. I usually tap with my fingernail, but sometimes it doesn't react, other times I have to swipe with my finger.<br />- Useless features: There are many useless features on this reader, such as awards, questions asking if you'd like to share your reading history on Facebook, etc.<br />- Thickness: Okay, the reader is actually relatively thin, however there is a feature that allows you to remove the back cover and purchase different colored plates. Seriously? Just leave it all out and make this thing thin!<br />- Screen issues: When resuming from sleep, the page first loaded seems unusually pale, moreso on the outer edges. Continuing to flip through the pages resolves this issue. Also, the page numbers in many of my books appear on the side of the screen, overlaying the text. This is also strange.<br /><br />While I took the time to meticulously point out all the flaws of the Kobo Mini, I have to also concede that while I'm not particularly happy with the reader, I DO carry it around with me everywhere (it fits into my pocket, though it takes up space, and also fits into a side pocket of my backpack when I go out). While the text is tiny, it's adjustable in size, sharpness, etc etc for those with poorer eyesight (To be honest though, if your eyesight is poor, get a larger screen!) My kindle does not get as much use as it used to, and I find myself in situations more often that I am able to pull out the kobo and read for a few minutes now and then, which is the main point overall.<br /><br />If you don't mind the nitpicking and can find this reader at a decent price (being whatever you'd be willing to pay for something, really) then go ahead and give this a try. I would first try it out at a store however, and see if you're okay with the sensitivity and the overall aesthetics.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/12/13: I have since -downgraded- my original rating of 4 starts down to 3 stars.<br />After having used the kobo exclusively for an additional month, I have continued to have issues with my kobo, the most frustrating aspect still being page turning. After resuming my session from being in standby mode, the kobo screen will not register any form of touch-communication. I have tried tapping, both with my fingernail and finger tip, sliding with both, on all parts of the kobo, yet the page refuses to turn. But sometimes the mere brush of a sleeve will throw the reader in a loop, and it will jump forward 2-3 pages.<br /><br />Another issue is that when I resume from standby, sometimes the kobo will back up anywhere from 1-3 pages previous to my position. This has happened reliably for the past week, at least 4 out of 5 times that I resume my kobo. This I hope can be resolved with a firmware update.<br /><br />I become more and more disheartened with this Kobo as time passes, yet I continue to use it and read it. With additional firmware updates, hopefully the reader will work out the majority of its issues that prevent it from being a solid piece of hardware.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/30/13: I noticed that the back decorative plate I was complaining about does not fit correctly onto the back of my Kobo now. There are two clasps (the ones at the top) that won't 'snap', and they bulge out. It's very minor, but when you notice it, you can't stop noticing.<br /><br />This morning I had a strange bug-out of my screen. The entire right side stopped working, and the left side actually moved the pages forward. Restarting the device didn't help, the pages would continually cycle through about 7-8 pages, and then it would jump me back to my starting point. I figured my unit was now completely fried, but upon checking it now, it /seems/ to be back in working order. One can only hope.<br /><br />Another star dropped in lieu of reliability/durability. Really, the only thing that this thing's got going for it is that it's so small.ing a solid piece of hardware.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/30/13: I noticed that the back decorative plate I was complaining about does not fit correctly onto the back of my Kobo now.

B0002VL0KQ|5.0|This is a great album to not only make memories for the young but to relive past memories for others.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Read this book...now. Get through 30 days and it will change your life. This is not a diet but a lifestyle. It all makes so much sense.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|One of those movies many dont know about that is VERY FUNNY......&#34;CUT SCENE&#34;...hahaha, I loved this movie, my lady did not...lol
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is great. great game for adults or kids. every day has a new objective to full fill. I would recommend to anyone
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Very well-done movie! Robin Williams is really funny as usual and can be serious as well. This movie makes you laugh and cry. With a great supporting cast, I highly recommend this movie!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|This movie was not as funny as I had hoped, and was fairly slow and boring through a large portion of it.  Overall, I was not very impressed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A girl at work gave me the first book to read.  I told her I would read one, but didn't think I would like it not really my type of book.  I couldn't put it down, I needed to find out what was going to happen.  I was hooked and had to get two on my kindle.  I read this book traveling over the Thanksgiving Holiday.  Thank God for over the river and through the woods to Grandma's house I couldn't put it down it was awsome.
B008COII1Y|1.0|This movie was not very fast paced or interesting.  Maybe civil war buffs who also like zombies may find it interesting.  The characters weren't particularly believable or likeable.  Very slow paced, boring dialogue and scenes.  Not recommended.
B003KRLKHC|4.0|Nice camera work, lone wanderer in post-apocalyptic world isn't a new idea but this is a nice twist.<br /><br />Denzel Washington seldom disappoints.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Good for all ages, an interesting twist on the classic fairy tale type story.  It has a good message about independence and choices.  Thoroughly enjoyable.
B005R32L66|3.0|It was hard to load skype & it's not as leamless as it is on my laptop,but it still works as a phone. The video is pretty much useless.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is simple easy to use exactly what I was looking for and the best part. it was free yea!
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Good sequel to the previous book of the series, Matched. Follows the same characters and develops them, though there are weaknesses in the world that is presented, geographically and logically.
B0086700CM|5.0|Good game. fun to play. easy to learn and easy to upgrade your character. keeps me occupied for more time than it should. I recommend it!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I keep my backup battery in my golf bag and have had the occasion to charge my phone multiple times while on the golf course. I have a 3500mah battery in my EVO 4G and the backup will fully charge it from zero to fully charged twice with more to spare. Simple to use with all the adapters you will need. No AC adapter is surprising, but not a problem. Great to have while traveling.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|unsure of why I waited so long to buy it!  It's a great movie - I highly recommend it - classic
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I don't usually read novellas, but Mr Sanderson is one of my favorite authors. He delivers with precision a small dose of his brilliant writing style in the Emperor's Soul. I am very glad I read it.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|unsure of why I waited so long to buy it!  It's a great movie - I highly recommend it - classic
B005ZUR724|1.0|hopefully they can fix this update so I can actually on the game and not waste my storage. until they fix this one star
B00428ZRFE|3.0|I love this CD it was great. It got here on time. And it was not messed up...THANKS Merry Christmas
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Rubbish. Chokes on large photos. Doesn't scale to screen width. Can't load more posts. Jumps back to top when scrolling down. Test your app, sheesh.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|I love this CD it was great. It got here on time. And it was not messed up...THANKS Merry Christmas
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|While not my favorite of the recent Marvel movies this is an enjoyable film. Chris Evans was born to play this role and I think the movie needed more Captain America elements.
B008M721MS|5.0|Kindle Fire 8.9\\" HD. Installed Skype for tablet from the Kindle App Store. Already had a Skype account on my computer so account setup was not an issue. Audio volume is buggered. The start up sound is fine. The ring sound is low and call volume is very low. This appears to be a software problem in Skype. They need to fix this problem.<br /><br />THe video quality is very good with a good wi-fi connection. The microphone works well and does not appear to pick up too much surrounding noise. The person I was talking to said that the volume was fine on their end.<br /><br />When Skype corrects the volume problem, this will be a 5 star application. Until then 3 stars at most.<br /><br />A delete and second install seems to have cured the volume problem and Skype now works well.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I heard about this book online and everyone raved about it. I bought it and read it cover to cover. Bryan Peterson explains all the nuances and secrets beautifully. His easy to understand way of writing will not scare non-technical or newbies. I have since purchased another of his books and subscribed to his website.<br />100%
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Its fun to play& helps with eye hand co-ordenation. It is good to have this game to play when commericals come on TV. I am a senior & I find the  birds are very juvenile, maybe a more adult theme in another game would be nice
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like the fact that I can check my yahoo mail while away from home without trying to read the little words on my cell phone. I also like the idea of it being right on the carousel for easy choosing.
0316044695|1.0|The lucid account of BUD/S was interesting. In fact, the description of Marcus Luttrell's hell week was so lucid that I wonder if it was really his hell week he was describing. With all the physical and psychologic demands and sleep deprivation, the details seem a little too sharp and crisp. The book deteriorated after hell week.<br /><br />I know a number of members of our special forces, and none of them display the braggadocio of Marcus Luttrell. However, they are more mature men, and some dispensation must be granted him for his youthful swagger and bluster. (His commanding officer asked him to vote on whether to shoot Afghan civilians? Really?)<br /><br />What I can't forgive Luttrell is for choosing such an inadequate collaborator in writing his story. The prose is truly dreadful, hackneyed, and overly politicized. There is a reason that the U.S. military is under civilian leadership, and that is so that the leadership is at least theoretically responsible to the American people. The authors of this book have missed this point. Overall, the book is written to the level of a 12-14 year old, but parents may find the subject matter too intense for that age group.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like it. I wish it could be viewed and not have to be connected to the internet to use.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is so good. Its worth 2.99. The gravity bubble is fun if you don't like it I don't know what to tell you accept for your cray cray.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|A pleasant read, so had to get ebook to complete my digital library. Prefer, however, the book &#34;The Four Agreements&#34;, if you haven't already heard of it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Well lets start of like this. Ok its a little hard but you get the hang of it.But Subway Suffers is better so if you are going to get this its good practice for Subway Suffers.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch can keep you turning pages every time.The black box adds a mystery to keep you there. Michael Conelly never lets you down
B007TXN4TK|1.0|Its hard confuseing and is horrible. If u r planning. on getting this game DONT its awfull. birding and dumb
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|Love my Roku with amazing Amazon app could have been a little cheaper paid 1.99 for Vampire Dairies and 2.99 for True Blood .
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|It's a good action/scifi movie.  Definitely worth renting,  however it would not have been worth paying the high theater ticket price for this movie.
B008OOYALE|5.0|very nice game, works great. just like the game on the ipad. lots of fun to play. love getting it free online
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The author's experience of a universe beyond that of our physical earth was moving, thought-provoking, and convincing. He addresses all of the controversial areas which seem, at first, to be unbelievable, and employs unimpeachable logic to support the validity of each. A life-changing book - my attitudes about life, the Deity, and the hereafter will never be the same!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|we love dragonvale and it works just as good on the android app as it does on the ipod touch app.
B004FN2CZY|5.0|Tim Curry!!!!....it was a great narration. MERRY CHRISTMAS and GOD BLESS US EVERYONE!  Charles Dickens, lives on in every telling of this book and Tim Curry narrates it best!
1423124111|5.0|I enjoyed paging through this very fine edition. The grahics are amazing and the posters are exactly what an art lover can appreciate.  Each print is worth framing.  But don't do that unless you plan to buy two books!
B005VPRETE|5.0|We are happy with this line of Legos, they combine well with the other Lego kits. Although my daughter had a lot of fun building the kit as drawn, she has had more fun using it to make her own creations and combining it with other kits she has (other Friends and the Monster Fighter line).
B007QVLKI2|5.0|First off; I am a 67 year old man raised on the Rolling Stones and U2.  My taste for modern music is limited.  This group, Of Monsters and Men, is in my opinion the best new band I have heard in a very long time.  There is just something about their music that makes it fun to listen to and genuinely entertaining.<br /><br />If you want something to listen to that will make you feel good and improve your day buy this album.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|Bruno mars is a very talented artist. That being said, the album is ordinary. Not much originality. I feel he just across the board of genres without really finding his own niche
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My nephew's 5th grade class was reading this book and he recommended it to me.  A truly inspiring book.  I had tears of joy at the end.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|In true Bounre fashion this movie is fast high flying action that keeps you on the edge of insanity. Can't wait for the next one!
B004MYF4SS|4.0|I found this story to be both a strong detective story and an excellent perspective about the Hebrides Islands. I recommend it highly for both reasons.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read many books on this subject but none like this. Being written by someone who is both a Dr and the patient puts a very different perspective on the subject. I am glad I bought it and recommend it highly.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I started buying the Rick Riordan Heroes of Olympus series for my daughter. She was hooked right away and has developed a strong interest in mythology and Greek and Roman history as a result. I started reading the books so as to make sure that they were appropriate for her. They certainly are, and they are also good, light reads for me. Not a huge fan of Mr Riordan's Kane Chronicles, but this series is very good.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We love this game. It's kind of a cross between monopoly and risk. It's easy to teach people to play and it never stops being challenging to win. We will be getting an expansion soon so that we can play with 2 more people.
0316017930|5.0|This was easily the best of Gladwell's work so far. It really gets at the concepts of what helps people succeed. And, to a large extent, success is not something one is born with. A person shapes their future and their success through a mix of talent and lots of hard work. As an educator, I quote this book heavily with both staff and students.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time, so I had to give it five stars. That said, I was disappointed to realize after purchasing it that I can't read it on my Kindle Classic! I didn't know that before purchasing. If I had, I probably wouldn't have bought it. It does work on my iPad, though, and is as wonderful, moving, and though provoking as ever. If you've never read the book before, please buy this. Just please make sure it's compatible with your device before purchasing!
B00633W614|5.0|This is the second in a trilogy, which, along with the first book, was one of the better books I read all year.  They are well-written and engrossing.  I can't wait til the third is released next year!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was definitely a page turner!  I had trouble putting it down and there were some great twists!  Well written!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Loved this movie.  Will have to buy in order to see out-takes and extras. Seth McFarlane is a genius. Can't wait until he hosts the awards' show.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this game, it had good graphics, a really good storyline, i really liked how long it was and it was creepy!!! please make a sequel!! :)
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Not a bad book....just get a little lost in it in places on all the medical jargon. Like how it changed authors way of looking at life though. If you have your doubts that heaven exists or know anyone who does I would suggest this book.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|So far, I like it. Keeps things organized; it display is clean, interference it integrates well. Looking forward to using it more.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Great escapism with a very real center theme. This movie doesn't have a Bourne in it, although the movie does have some references to Jason that tie back to the previous Bourne film.<br /><br />Whereas the CIA bent Jason to it's purposes with brainwashing, Agent Cross is a product of genetic engineering/experimentation by a civilian government contractor with  too much freedom and not enough oversight.<br /><br />Great action scenes, cliff-hanger suspense and a plot real enough to make you believe in it.
B000XVSU9O|5.0|A very hopeful look at the &#34;Other Side&#34; of life and the spiritual world, written by someone who has been there and came back to tell us about it.<br />The world beyond is mysterious and personal.  A glimpse of that world has come to many, whatever their religion or place in life.<br />Betty Eadie tells us of her journey in the miraculous.  She reports that this place of universal love and peace is open to all.  Her savior is Jesus.  But each person has his or her own guardian and link to the Source of life, whatever name we use.<br /><br />Each of us also has a task to perform in Earth's daily world of &#34;reality&#34; where we live and experience, she says.  What we do and how we do it is up to us.  It does have its effect on the rest of us.  The less pain and sorrow we bring to one another, the more hope we have for the future of us all--and the less pain we bring on ourselves.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|Good action flick, I enjoyed it. Lots of fighting scenes and kick ass action. The wardrobe in the movie is pretty cool too
B009VA1FN6|5.0|A WONDERFUL READ. IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT DOWN ONCE I STARTED, READ IT ONE SITTING. SO WELL WRITTEN WITH ALL THE TWISTS AND TURNS. HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO ALL OF MY READER FRIENDS.
B000021Y77|5.0|Faves - one of my all time favorite movies. Even subtitled, this is a must have movie. I love the switch off in time frame and added cartoon scenes.
B003N5VOUO|4.0|Never seen Shah play this role before and it was a treat.  Whole new perspective on those who struggle in life with this disorder.
B0030U1TLQ|5.0|WHO DOESNT LIKE THE CURE AND TO GET THE SECOND REMASTERED DELUX EDITION WAS VERY COOL IN FACT I JUST KEEP IT AS A COLLECTORS ITEM I HAVENT EVEN OPENED IT
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very exciting I look forward to reading more!!! I am getting the trilogy,and all the movies when they come out.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|SUPERNATURAL IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS AND I NEEDED TO CATCH UP BEFOR THE NEW SEASON STARTED SO I BOUGHT IT AND THEN SOMEONE STOLE IT SO ID SAY IT WAS STILL WORTH IT
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book was my favorite read of 2012. Great story, non-stop action and lots of authentic details. Couldn't put it down!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS SO FUNNY AND WEIRD AND AWESOME I CANT EVEN EXPLAIN IT BUTITS IN MY TOP FIVE FAVORITES OF ALL TIME AND I SUGGEST YOU BUY IT AND WATCH IT ASAP
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Factual fiction or fictional fact? The Bourne Legacy movie exposes a hidden world too frightening and dangerous to be covered by our impotent mainstream media. Like a microscope user, the movie viewer sometimes sees a world invisible to the naked eye---this world is ugly. Programmed killers. Crazed &#34;lone gunman&#34; mass murderers. Implanted chips. Dying microbiologists. CIA black op funding. Drones over America.<br /><br />Bourne seems to be a &#34;Mr. Smith&#34; for the 21st century, except if  he were to &#34;go to Washington&#34; he would be assassinated by the &#34;government&#34; forces. Like the &#34;Lone Gunman&#34; TV series fictional representation of a CIA robotic airliner attack on the World Trade Center (aired months before 911), this movie gives the world a peek inside the petri dish of 21st century NWO America.<br /><br />And for those who just want to be entertained, it is very entertaining. Enjoy the popcorn and pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Bad storyline and boring. I know why Matt Damon did not come back for this installment. I would pass on this one.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|For many years I found it curious that the female vocalists aside from opera I tend to listen to are from a bygone era: Ella Fitzgerald, Nina Simone, Cesaria Evora, Billie Holiday... They all could touch some nerve and be listened to for hours on end.  And they all had gorgeous voices.  Modern female singers tend to have engineered voices and their music tends to be of the lowest caliber lacking any sort of soul.  I all about gave up on them.<br />Then Imelda May came along.  Wow.  I must say, I was blown away.  Firstly - by the vocals and very cool lyrics.  This isn't your typical longing perpetually stuck in teenage form.  Oh no, this is how love (and many, many aspects of it) can be seen through the eyes of a grown, sassy, and confident woman, who just happens to have a knack for stringing together amazingly tuneful melodies and hooks.  Now, it must be said, she has one of the best bands in the world - this is apparent from the moment you hear Darrel Higham amazing Gretch.  The wind instruments are also superb, as is the rhythm section.  They play like a highest-caliber jazz band, yet their focus is obviously rockabilly revival.  I remember back in the nineties, when after grunge's anxiety-filled era, people experienced a brief sense of pure fun and listened to swing and ska bands. It was quickly replaced by synthetic pop and its um-pa-dum-pa glitter.  How thankful I am to Imelda and her band for making \\"pop\\" (?) music cool again.<br />Her songs tend to range from upbeat songs filled with curious, to say the least, characters (Psycho) to reflective beautiful ballads (Kentish Town Waltz), with more air time given to the former kind on this CD.  Which is great, actually, because she manages to cram so much sass and attitude into each of these, it's a pure delight to listen to over and over.  Her voice can glide with apparent ease across slower or high-flying numbers, but manages a bluesy \\"growl\\" when a need arises, like on get-even opening song. An enhanced version of this CD contains a few mp3s (More Mayhem) with some neat arrangements of the songs from the main album and a couple of bonus tracks.  The funky \\"Inside Out\\" and energetic \\"Road Runner\\" are the standouts there.<br />Overall, this along with other Imelda May records, such as her earlier album \\"Love Tattoo\\" and \\"Rock `n Roll Party\\" with Jeff Beck are must gets.  I, for one, can't wait for more from this talented and beautiful artist from one of the most amazing cities of the world.of this CD contains a few mp3s (More Mayhem) with some neat arrangements of the songs from the main album and a couple of bonus tracks.

B009KHDT0C|1.0|Trying to acquire some modernisms, based on the real Dark shadows, I was sure, since it was Tim Burton, that it could be dark humor but it was the bad taste what turned me off completely. Despite of Johnny Depp impersonation of Barnabas Collins and Michelle Pfeiffer, everything else is expendable.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|like many others recently about Chinese ambitions.  Was stil a decent read but didnt seem as well developed as earlier Clancy works
B007FTZDN8|5.0|So many interesting speakers and topics!  Always a fresh approach to get you thinking of topics in a new way.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|This a classic American demonstration of the ability to bastardize any product.  This is Sherlock for the \\"Monster\\" imbibing and AR-15 carrying American who desires to think not and reason less, the central process in the original stories from Doyle.  Pathetic and a waste of my money and time!  If you have any inkling of the original stories or of the Granada produced video stories you need to avoid this like one attempts to avoid the plague.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is adicting.....it keeps challenging you more & more...I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like a different type of game.
B004I744AS|5.0|The first time I looked at this I did not realize what it offered.  This morning I discovered what it offers. I will use it at least once a day. I like the information and word games that I can do by myself instead of looking for another player.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is the kind of book that you wait for. I love these types of stories and it made me feel empowered, yet kind of filthy at the same time for enjoying it so much. John Grisham never disappoints. I can't wait to read another book, and hopefully it will be on the same subject matter, as this one really worked for his style. If you haven't read it already, it is worth the read.
B002RKSU3K|5.0|This is a classic book. Everyone who reads this will love it. It is a fun to read book; and is very positive for anyone to read. I recomend all ages to read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The graphics are pleasing, game play is simple, yet the puzzle can be challenging (if you're accomplishing minimum moves). It is long enough to really enjoy. I actually like that there is an end. But if you want some more, there are paid version of by the same authors.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|This book was awesome!! It had a little touch of mystery, fun, romance, and everything combined!! I just adored this book. I read it over and over again and it never get's old!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this. game so much and it cant get. any better but it can explain alittle. better .  and y'all could put more games and levels

B0017VT5E8|5.0|Great old movie for all boxing fans! I loved all the Rocky movies. I may purchase the box set in the future.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|It's OK to put some ads to free game, but interfering gameplay every 15 sec with  15 second movie is way beyond acceptable. Deleted app after 1 minute of playing and I will not buy anything from Rovio anymore, evethough I was huge fan of Angry Birds and had all releases on my phone. Rovio stepped over the line of greediness here.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|This was the first NDE book I've ever read and yet the words felt true. I loved the style of writing. The author said enough to convince me that he really did have this experience based on his medical background but his experience of heaven also carried a major message which I think was the oneness of the unconditional love of God (or Ohm :-))<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for the experience of God without any limits.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am not much of a book reader, but I can't put this book down!  Great for a vacation or relaxing afternoon.
B0083Z614S|4.0|This was a pretty awesome book because I enjoy reading about it. I love it very much so thank you.
0205313426|5.0|There's not much to be said about this one that hasn't been said by others. It's compact, precise, and, when appropriate, funny as hell. The only fault is that some 'guidelines' are presented as hard-and-fast rules, and while it has been updated in recent years, it's still a bit dated. But even then, The Elements of Style (****1/2) is a book I don't foresee ever leaving my bookshelf.
B009MF5BXK|1.0|The first 'Expendables' was a guilty pleasure. Not quite up to the standards of the best of the A-list action pictures such as 'The Dirty Dozen', 'Rambo', 'The Seven Samurai' , and 'Commando', 'The Expendables' was still a fun B-list action film that depended on expertly staged stunt work and an adequate budget to support it. No CGI here.<br /><br />The story line of 'The Expendables' was believable and internally consistent with the script.  'The Expendables 2' will have you shaking your head when you notice scripting inconsistencies.<br /><br />The action sequences in the first film were realistically depicted. No superhero stuff here. The second film will have you wondering how much more incompetent the bad guy minions could possibly get. Can't they hit anyone?<br /><br /> The characters in the first film were portraying as a group of aging mercenaries. Although each character was played by a well known action film actor, the characters they played were consistent with the plot. Our action heroes of the second film do not play the aging mercenaries of the first film but play the movie roles of their younger actor selves; action movie stars 'playing' at being mercenaries complete with script references to older roles that they played in previous movies.<br /><br />CGI is extensively used in 'The Expendables 2'. Fake is fake and it is all too obvious. The stunt work is minimal and most of the action sequences look like it was staged for a video game and not a movie set.<br /><br />The insertion of actors into cameos in 'The Expendables 2' seem forced and obvious.  Jet Li makes a brief appearance, does his thing, and then says goodbye and disappears from the film.  Schwarzenegger's, Willis' and Norris' insertion into the film are the same.  And the insertion of Liam Hemsworth as Billy (a last minute change when Mickey Rourke bowed out of the film) will have you crying at the waste of such an interesting new character.<br /><br />The sequel 'The Expendables 2' fallsoff of a very big cliff and is a big disappointment.  The action sequences are poorly edited. The sequences look more like a cartoon and the characters bear minimal resemblance to the portrayal of these same characters in the first film.<br /><br />It seems to me that van Damme is the only one to get it right. Unfortunately there is not enough of him. His performance in the film seems to have been intentionally staged as a parody of a psychotic killer. His portrayal is the only interesting role in the entire film and the reason I hesitate to award the film only 1 star. He finishes the film with a hilarious over-the-top performance when he meets Barney Frank (Stallone)  in a  man-to-man testosterone induced fight that decides who is the baddest of them all. Yes, the film ends with the cliche ridden good guy fights bad guy fight scene.<br /><br />And last of all, let us not forget the DVD extras. Two particular extras stand out. The first claims to be a history of the evolution of the action movie star of movies of the 1970's and 1980's. Unfortunately, it plays more like a political ad in its admiration of President's Ronald Reagan and George Bush. The second is an explanation of the various weapons used in the film which couldn't help but insert the statements that Nevada is a great state because you can buy any kind of weapon you want, semi-auto and automatic weapons with extended ammo clips banned in other states.<br /><br />I am sure to get criticized for pointing THAT out.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Personally, I'm completely burnt out on post-apocalyptic fiction.  Even with this book's 25,000 positive reviews, I just wasn't sure I wanted to spend 5 whole dollars on it.<br /><br />Perhaps you're in the same boat.  Do what I did:  download the &#34;sample&#34; from Kindle.  In most cases, a sample of a book gives you just a chapter or two.  In this case, you get the entirety of Wool 1, which stands alone completely, and ought to have you completely sold on Hugh Howey's universe by the time you're finished.<br /><br />Wool 1 is my kind of story.  I am a fan of science fiction and horror, but I especially love stories in which an author reveals his hand slowly, in which you get the sense that something is wrong, but only gradually begin to understand the scope of just how wrong.  Wool gently builds its atmosphere and intrigue, and culminates in a gut-punch of a finale that will leave you wanting more.<br /><br />The subsequent Wool chapters build directly on the story laid out by the first, and are equally good, but it's that first story that I keep coming back to, time and again.
159102594X|5.0|\\"The Blade Itself\\" by Joe Abercrombie is hands down one of the best books I've ever read, which makes it so difficult to believe that this was Abercrombie's first novel.  IT'S THAT GOOD.  This book contains some of the best character development I've ever read, especially in the case of Superior Glokta, who I absolutely cannot get enough of.  The entire story flows along beautifully, nothing feels contrived or forced, the prose is beautiful, and the dialog is completely believable.  All of this coupled with a very sharp, dark sense of humor made this one very enjoyable read.<br /><br />I never thought I would say this about any book, but I have to admit that I think I enjoyed this novel as much as Martin's \\"Game of Thrones\\". This book was by far less complicated yet just as brilliant.  In my opinion, Joe Abercrombie is the next big fantasy superstar and my new favorite author.  5 BIG STARS
B0032FPVKE|5.0|Smaller then I expected but now I only take the things with me that I really need. It has helped me to be better Organized and keep my camera safe.

B008ZCWFEE|5.0|Great App for helping to understand Algebra and developing the concepts while having fun.<br />I highly recommended it for all ages.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I normally grab these novels and read them in a couple of days, but I have had this one for several weeks and am only about 1/4 through it.  There just doesn't seem to be anything new, the same storyline, the same personal and family problems just rehashed in a different theme.  Not sure if I will finish this one...
B008C401YG|4.0|I think my headline says it all.<br />Sean Rowe has a deep voice that I find soothing albeit melancholy.<br />Reminds me a bit of Nick Cave.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|A 22 year old coworker recommended this book.  He raved about it.  This is definitely a book that would appeal to a 22 year old.
0553260081|5.0|I love Sylvia Plath's work. She is a great writer that did not live to see her well received style of writing. RIP Sylvia
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|From my blog 4 1/2<br /><br />What a great read, I actually enjoyed, almost loved a hyped book, I have to agree that this one deserves the hype, wow wow wow.  And............ it is YA, not my cup of tea but it had me engaged the whole time.  Something about the summary and reviews, I was intrigued, very glad I gave it a try.<br /><br />An emotional book with lots of humour, dark humour, childish humour, many many many laughs throughout the story.<br /><br />I loved getting to know teenagers that are not the norm, almost everyone had cancer in different forms and a major plus is that the parents were included in the story.  Hazel and Gus had their own language, what I consider true soul mates.  I loved their journey, my favourite parts were the dialogue throughout the story, fascinating, beautiful, emotional and downright hilarious.<br /><br />The scenarios of what Hazel and Gus chose has their wish, kind of Wish Foundation was so amazing I was touched.  Gus reaction to Hazel's was a favourite funny part.  Quote &#34;Hazel GRACE!&#34; he shouted.  &#34;You did not use your one dying Wish to go to Disney World with your parents.&#34;  &#34;Also Epcot Center,&#34; I mumbled. &#34;Oh, my God,&#34; Augustus said.  &#34;I can't believe I have a crush on a girl with such cliche wishes.&#34;  Seriously, that is the best dialogue ever.<br /><br />I think this book will pass the test of time and 10 years from now will still be on reader and book stores favourite lists.<br /><br />I highly recommend this one, I think everyone will enjoy.  There is so much in this book and the reviews I have read give minimal, mainly I believe because you just have to experience it for yourselves without any prior knowledge of details.<br /><br />I have to now go read more John Green, he may just become my YA go to author when I'm in the mood.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope. I'm going to accept it with a dose of your indifference, and move on.\\"<br /><br />So I have had time to let Holder and Sky sit there in my head, and now I feel I can do this review a little more justice!<br /><br />I tried! I tried SO SO hard, unbelievably hard to \\"LIVE\\" this book,.. but I just couldn't, I really couldn't every ounce of my soul just LOVED it, in fact LOVES it, all 114,000 words and I savored every single one of them, it was just perfect, 5 stars is not enough, it will never be enough! By only having 5 stars it makes you want to go and re-rate every other book you have rated 5 stars just so this one, this AMAZING one, stands head and shoulders above the rest!<br /><br />When you decide that you are going to read one of Colleen Hoovers books you need to leave yourself open, make sure there is no lock anywhere around your heart, she will drag you through the depths of despair and break you, and then piece by piece put you back together only to break you again.. but you are there living it word for word, as if you 'are' the characters and that you're standing beside them living everything they are living, every touch, every tear, every heartache.<br /><br />Hopeless is a beautiful story, with so much LIKE and so much LOVE in one respect and then so sad and emotional in another, it touches on very deep subjects that some people may struggle with, but more than anything this story is about HOPE and LOVE and how anything in life no matter how bad, can be overcome. It truly is beautiful!<br /><br />\\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan to kiss you.\\"
0385342063|2.0|Sophie always spins a light pleasing girlie yarn that tickles me like champagne bubbles....until this one.<br /><br />A 4th grader could have written this.  The characters were 1/2 dimensional and someone stole the plot. This HAD to be a house payment it was so poorly constructed and dashed out by by the author.<br /><br />As it is nearing Christmas I would avoid purchasing this as a gift unless you wanted to give someone a good nap.<br /><br />Avoid reading!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you liked last season you should like this one, A lot of the same actors, different vibe but still better than most t.v. shows.
0618001905|3.0|As previous reviewers have already written at length, I will simply say that this excellently researched account of the unambiguous cruelty of Leopolds reign in the Congo is something everyone should know about and should not forget.  There was no excuse for the barbarity displayed.<br /><br />Where the author goes off the rails somewhat in my estimation is in the brief comparisons that he draws with the experience of the Congolese and the experiences of all colonised peoples.  It is clear that the author abhors colonialism (he is after all from Berkley) and writes as though all colonialist rule was exactly the same.  Whilst nobody could pretend that colonialists acted out of altruism, the fact is that some good emerged in some parts of the world as a byproduct of the aims of the imperialists.  (A certain parallel here with capitalism).  Whats more some reviewers have jumped eagerly upon the authors dismissal of the European role (particularly the British) in the abolition of slavery, then a world wide and firmly entrenched part of society.  This book was never intended to be a complete history of European colonialism  (such a book, without the dubious benefit of political correctness has yet to be written) but as a histroy of the degredation to which colonialism sank in the Congo, I recommend it thoroughly.<br /><br />I wait with some trepidation for these more general remarks to leaped upon by hordes of politically correct true (and, may I say, slightly naive) true believers.<br /><br />Enjoy the read
B004LWZWGK|5.0|NO Joker but Bane is very well played and makes as great foe for Bruce and Bats, the story is fantastic worthy of the Dark Knight.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|Okay, I know I love a good chick flick but this one adds the element of Christmas to it.  A perfect recipe for those long winter nights just add a bowl of popcorn, some steaming hot chocolate along with your best girlfriends.<br /><br />In fact, if you looking for a last minute gift this would be perfect!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I liked this book because I couldn't predict what was going to happen.  I still like to be surprised and made to think when I read.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Because it is very enthralling....main characters getting killed when you don't expect it.....hating to put it down.....and can't wait to get back to it.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This was a good book and kept my interest.  I had trouble keeping the characters straight for about half of it. It is a powerful book and makes you think about our society.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|loved the movie, awesome 3D box, has everything it says it brings, came on time, great quality in all the formats, really liked it all.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed Dr. Alexander's story very much.  I didn't find it hoaky or &#34;farout&#34; like some of the others on this subject. I like all the medical information he gives about his illness which makes it all sound more credible to me. His family history was very honest and touching. I will check out his website/nonprofit and watch his progress in this area.
0345803507|2.0|My opinion is based on the content of the book.  All sex and no story is NOT good.  Additionally, I didn't like the last two chapters which seemed like chapters edited out but the author had to include them anyway.  I only finished reading the book because I had already invested so much time reading the first two books.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book!!!! I would read it again!!!! Very interesting!!!  Loved it so much! Best out of all of the others
B0030B624E|5.0|iMDB says this was originally a pilot for a TV series (keep an eye out for zombie kill of the week) but I have no idea how they thought it would ever make it to the small screen.  Decidedly a zombie film with the modern, fast zombies, but also a comedic gem.<br /><br />Some really good acting; the dialog is touch and go, but still funny and well delivered. Great cameo with Bill Murray. It's also cool to see Woody Harelson as a tough guy after some of the other great acting I've seen him do.<br /><br />All in all, this is well worth your time and investment if you like funny zombie movies, the really sad part is, it just leaves you wanting more at the end of the film....
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book.  Awesome and terrifying concept.  Could not put it down.  Definitely going to read books 6 and 7.  Awesome

B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Love this game. Very fun and hard to put down. Only bad thing its the advertisements can get annoying when you are playing and it cuts to an ad with no warning.
B007MDB71O|5.0|In a nutshell, I can pick out problems here and there throughout this movie, but this is a wonderful, heart-felt, beautiful, sweeping, romantic, swashbuckling fantasy.<br /><br />There's a LOT to like here. The effects are nearly flawless, the scope is large, and it captures much of what was great in Edgar Rice Burroughs' original novels and brings it lovingly to life.<br /><br />I keep wanting to watch it again and again, to be carried away to by this fabulous, \\"impossible\\" story. I've worked through my issues with the flaws, and I think a more experienced, emotive actor as John Carter himself would have helped everything come together more, but Taylor Kitsch is playing a very tightly-wound guy with a gaping hole in his soul, so his portrayal makes a kind of sense, and he carries the role just fine.<br /><br />As a parental guide: it has a couple scenes of graphic violence, but like most PG-13 movies, the blood is never red and the bad guys are all monsters. One of these scenes is a crucial moment for a character, and is actually a beautiful, poignant scene the way it's executed.<br /><br />Buy it, own it, and enjoy it for years. It's fun ride, full of old ideas made new again, with old-fashioned, romantic (in the classical sense) sensibilities.
B008NW1M4K|5.0|V<br /><br />IMPORTANT INFORMATION<br />The German Kindle edition has been abridged by at least 30% as I learnt from German reviews.<br />So please stick to the printed edition if you prefer the real thing!!!<br /><br />HARDCOVER<br />Unbelievably ingenious satire by Timur Vermes, born in Nuremberg to a German mother and a refugee Hungarian father, refreshingly non-pc and thus apparently meeting the contemporary needs and demands of the German speaking readership<br /><br />This book was a No 1 bestseller in extremely politically correct Germany for months on end and received 1661 reviews to this day, which speaks for itself.<br />More than 700000 copies of \\"Er ist wieder da\\" were sold until June 2013 and it was translated into 27 languages. I sincerely hope the translations do justice to the original German edition, because the whole story lives off typical German connotations, puns, the current bizarre political drama and its preposterous protagonists.<br /><br />Highly recommended to everyone who appreciates an intelligent, brilliantly witty, priceless read.<br /><br />German wikipedia says it will be shot in 2014, which in fact says nothing ;-) and I doubt the film will live up to the book.<br /><br />(Btw, relatively authentic background knowledge e.g. [[ASIN:184212028X Hitler's Table Talk]]  might increase the pleasure of this treat)<br /><br />P.S.: [[ASIN:B00ERWXW48 AH - Ich war nie weg (German Edition)]] \\"I was never away\\" is not as amusing as \\"He is back again\\", but even more authentic and worth to read nonetheless ;-)
B009ZE27US|5.0|it clearly stats tut this is for HUMOR so it posed to be funny. u apply get mad at an app just cuz u didn't read wht it said. I got emotion scanner and loved it. I don't no if ill get this app though. just sounds funny and cool. thx 4 listening 2 me opinion.  :)
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I don't care how many versions of this are put out with however many sequels, prequels, extra features and Prometheus-es they throw in, buy THIS version.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|If you like season 1 and 2 on netflix.  Then you like season 3, really not sure what else to say :)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It's a very useful app that helps me know how long I can do something before it dies. It shows me how much percent of my battery I have left and whether or not it's charging.
B0076OV7F0|5.0|Love Her Music..this CD is very good. She has an interesting voice, one that is hard to forget..Hope she puts all her songs to CD,etc.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|This really is one of my favorite horror movies, period. The opening can seem a bit cheesy, but you'll notice the humor of it all if you've ever watched any paranormal investigation shows, especially Ghost Adventures. The opening montage for the show within the movie is ripped directly from Ghost Adventures and is one of my favorite parts of the movie. The thing I liked best about this movie is that you're never really wondering why the characters are making so many stupid moves. They are genuinely trapped with no way out. They stick together when it's appropriate to do so, and split up when you would probably decide it was best to split up. The acting isn't great and a bit two-dimensional, but I definitely got the vibe that this was done to take a bit of a jab at the investigation shows it's taking a jab at. As things get more tense, the characters gain a bit more depth and, by the end, I can't guarantee that you'll feel connected to the characters, but there's definitely a great chance of that happening. All in all, a great movie but it does walk a line between taking itself seriously and not doing so, so I think you'll get a lot more from it if you don't expect much from it and just look forward to watching a really fun, well-crafted horror film.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great love it. it seems like everyone has it all my bfs do. everyone should have this game and if you say this game is not cool your wrong its awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)  :-)  !!!!!!!

B00966TN1Q|5.0|i bought the book on kindle<br />and though it was a great read<br />I love Harry Bosch in the novels<br />If we had more Harry Bosch,s<br />in Ireland we would not have so many<br />unsolved cases  love Michael Connelly<br />always waiting on his next novel .
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was so interesting and f<br />un to read.  Prime Grisham.  I recommend this to all fans of John .
B008AX1HD8|5.0|I am in the middle of reading all of his<br />novels very very good .The mystery in the<br />novels is edge of your seat story .
B0060D123K|5.0|This movie always helps to put me in the Christmas spirit.  I love to watch it! It is so awesome!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Not just the campy comic book movies you would expect!  Batman is a darker character and the films did him justice with his struggle to be Gotham's Avenger while also being Gotham's #1 spoiled little rich kid.  Brooding and excellent!
B0013TTLDE|3.0|Very similar reading to Kate Morton's other book, the Forgotten Garden.  If choosing between the two, I recommend the latter, but this is a good read nonetheless.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|How could you pass on possibly the greatest gangster film & sequel in the history of film?  While the 3rd film was just too much, the original and sequel were supurb films of a good guy who was meant to do right ending up going wrong and doing the opposite of what the father wanted.  So great on blu-ray.  LOVE IT!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Definitely better than the last two John Grisham books, The Litigators and The Confession, this was a slight nod to his first books, but not quite as gripping.  An interesting twist on the legal system and staying a step ahead of the curve...  Enjoyable reading but able to be put down.
B00656C6KK|5.0|I have always liked Doris Day and her music.  When I saw it offered I ordered it and enjoy it as well as all the others.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly has written another winner.  It is not my favorite however, and I have others that I feel were better.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Sorry I paid to watch this movie...what a disappointment Matthew was , why would he do this movie, it was way beneath his talent.What a cheesey role
B000ICRKLM|5.0|Love, love, love this series of shows! But like all good things, it came to its end! :(<br />If you are a syfy buff, this will not disapoint.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Was really impressed with Tom Cruise...WOW  he nailed it as a rock star, also liked Julianne Hough. She sang really well.
B00942Y4IY|4.0|It was a great movie, especially in crystal clear HD thanks to Amazon. The major downfall of this space movie, like all if not most space movies, is its crippling reliance on Statist sophistry. Nonetheless, it's an excellent science fiction film that exploded in to one of the best television franchises to hit the airwaves.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Just okay, surprised because word of mouth said it was hysterical....it had a few moments. Seth Macfarlane is usually on target.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This movie had so much potential, great effects, great actors, but yet it still it left me standing. The original was better... even with horrible special effects.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Loved this movie !!!!! It was great to see all the action heroes that I grew up with in one movie!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Excellent, entertaining show. Interesting plots, fun interaction between Holmes and Watson. Innovative twist on the original Sherlock Holmes story. I highly recommend it.
B000T433CO|5.0|Great holiday movie! The music is fun, the English countryside enchanting. I want to adopt &#34;Graham's&#34; little girls and own each of Cameron Diaz's coats!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Its ridiculous that there's no way to earn enough gems without purchasing them.  You cant move forward very far without spending money to buy gems.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|It's a beautifully written book that I read for a while and then put down and didn't pick up again (you know, so many books, so little time).  For whatever that's worth.  As I said, wonderfully written, but it obviously didn't work for me.  However, all my friends just loved it!  So I think it must have been me.  It's still on my bedside table for me to pick back up should the spirit move me.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Kept me going the whole time.  Tom Clancy is on top of his game.  Very much enjoying Jack Jr and his adventures.
B000KW6HN2|5.0|This is one of the best First Ammendment films ever made.  It's completely thrilling at the end as the lawyer for Flynt presents to the Supreme Court.  It's a whimsical, sad, funny film about some odd people who understand more than most the power of free speech and how it must be protected even if disagreed with.  I  made the suggestion that my book club substitue this film for a book one month and although the ladies weren't too sure about that, it dazzled them all and led to a very lively discussion on the fact that there are different views and beliefs, and perhaps one isn't really superior over another and that they all must be protected.  If you've never seen this movie run, don't walk, to your Amazon cloud and pull it down for a most entertaining and informative two hours!
B0076DELIG|5.0|How can you go wrong with any Michael Connelly's books?  One of my go to authors for a nice mystery.  Ranks equal with James Patterson.
B003L16FAE|5.0|I have seen Predator several times, including twice when it in the cinema. I also catch it on cable here and there.<br /><br />But when I watched this film on Blu-ray on my plasma telly it was just freaking AMAZING!!!!! It was so crisp and clear it was like looking through a window. My mum walked in when I was watching it and was just gobsmacked by how clear it was. You can see every whisker and drop of of sweat on all their faces. The forest, the predator, the girl just so freaking amazing!!! I loved this film before but now blu-ray it moves up a while new level! Wow!<br /><br />As far as the story this film is really two films. Its the first third of so that is the rescue mission and the last two thirds which was to deal with the predator. It's funny I think the first part was one of the best &#34;mercenary/military&#34; types of films of the 80's. I would have been perfectly happy to see a film made with the same characters in just a military film. I love Arnold no doubts, but I think as an ensemble this group worked so well together. I wish they had gone back after Predator and made a prequel of the team in action in a non-sci-fi scenario. I find now days that I will often watch the film right up to the point when the predator starts killing and then I stop watching.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great film and still in my mind a bit underrated by the public at large. Good stuff!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|kept me on the edge of my seat. I know why this show is winning awards. very convent way of watching this series
B008XBCJ34|5.0|We just got a 3D television and this was a must for the collection.  We watched it the other night and are happy to say that it was the same quality as the theater.
1878424114|4.0|I liked this book a lot, there are a lot of good messages in it and you will gain a lot by reading it the only con is there are some parts of the book that are a bit hard to follow, so you need to take a minute and think about it, in reality thats a good thing, but its not one of those books that you can read as a story book.
1423113462|5.0|vocabulary is a great tool for kids as well as the lore and ledgends son love the writer and series
160774273X|5.0|This book could easily receive one or five stars, depending on what you are looking for.  It was perfect for me, but I would like to clarify exactly what it is you would get out of this book, and what you would not.<br /><br />First off, if you are looking for a book of great, simple recipes that you can throw in the breadmaker real quick once you get home, this is NOT the book for you.  If you're looking more for a diverse bread recipe book vs break knowledge, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />This is a very good equivalent of a breadcrafting 101 textbook.  Now, I say 'breadcrafting' vs just 'baking' because this book takes you far beyond \\"mix X and Y, bake at Z, eat.\\"  Using the same very simple ingredients (see title), you will make a variety of different flavors, based on times, ferments, etc.  You will learn how to literally use temperature and times as ingredients and how these can make bread made with the very same ingredients VERY different.  You will truly learn the basics of making great bread.  I would note that this book also calls for a covered dutch oven to finally bake these loaves in, which will replace much in the way of expensive baking equipment and give a lovely crust.<br /><br />For the book itself: There are literally over a hundred favored methods of breadmaking all over the world.  This book contains a much smaller focused area than, say, Peter Reinhart's \\"Bread Baker's Apprentice\\".  The recipes are for lean dough, non-enriched breads, made straight, with delayed fermentation, and finally as pure sourdough.  The doughs he uses are very wet (usually well in excess of 70% hydration), and his preference to hand-forming everything in the bowl vs using a mixer, etc, will actually give some excellent groundwork in learning dough handling.  An advantage to wet doughs (among other things like quality), is that you can most easily feel changes in the dough as you work it, teaching you to make bread by feel, and really KNOW when things are ready.  The basic recipe is varied with different flours, bigas or poolishes, and finally making and using a sourdough culture.  The variations one learns of a recipe are incredible in terms of taste and texture, when the main variables are time and temp.<br /><br />This book is a fantastic stepping stone for more varied texts (Bread Bible, Bread Baker's Apprentice, and the all but sacred bread text \\"The Taste of Bread\\" by Raymond Calvel).  If you are looking to learn the basic knowledge needed to make truly magnificent bread in your home, this is the book to start with.  If you are a more advanced baker, but still need to solidify the basics covered in this text, you will find that material familiar but new at the same time, and will get more than your money's worth.<br /><br />Happy reading!.

B000Y96EWK|5.0|I have the entire Bourne collection.  One of my favorite movies.... cant say enough good about this movie... it is a must see
B00APUQJLO|2.0|The acting/plot in this movie just wasn't for me.  I enjoy wallstreet/business films--but this did not meet my expecations.  If you are a fan of Robert Pattinson--then this movie may work for you--but the drama/thriller element did not quite hit its mark.  Lot of dialogue that reminded me of the agents talking in the \\"Matrix\\" movie--very non emotional/cold--but not as cool as the matrix.  Pattison is not a bad actor--but this movie is not be his best work.<br /><br />If you are looking for a wallstreet drama/thriller--then check out \\"Arbitrage\\" with Richard Gere or \\"Margin Call\\" with Kevin Spacey.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|It had a decent plot line and awesomely hilarious and spontaneous jokes. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Family Guy, or comedies in general.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars because is was something original. It was exciting at first, then heartbreaking towards the end. I thought about this movie for weeks later, asked anyone and everyone I came in contact with, if they had seen it yet and to please watch it. Many great lessons learned here. Don't trust so easily, someone on the internet, to fall in love with. I never have and never will.<br />Buying this movie wasn't for myself but for my young friend at work. He's only 23 and loves the internet. This could be helpful for him.<br />The characters are real and I felt all of their emotions in this roller coaster ride, of a movie.<br />I cannot say enough about it. Watch it, you'll be amazed, too.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|This series is the Best at the moment and i love the suspense in the series. The walking dead is very crippy and exciting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I find google gets me the best results for my searches<br />It give me results other search engines do not
B009QW7HMC|5.0|This series is the Best at the moment and i love the suspense in the series. The walking dead is very crippy and exciting! Thrilled by the excitement and the challenges that everyone goes through as the whole place is infested with a deadly virus. Quick to think and swift like a goat are the Zombies awaiting to have you for dinner.. run for your life!! aka some Zombies known as Ahkeel the big goat and Titus the middle goat and old Robert the old goat zombie. I could be running as swift as a goat too if the virus happened in my world. Go GOaty!
B0002IQOZA|2.0|I'm going to echo one of the popular complaints about this album. As fantastic as her voice is (and she really was \\"the best\\" of that group that came up from the Mickey Mouse Club), Christina seems to always be trying to prove that she can sing. On her original albums, it's not AS big of a problem for me (do you, Christina), but on a Christmas album, it's just unnecessary.  The over-the-top runs kill most of the songs that should be pleasant to listen to. O Holy Night is my absolute favorite Christmas carol and I couldn't sit through her version. I had high expectations of it. She is a BIG voice, but she doesn't seem to reign it in for these songs. Same for The Christmas Song. I can deal with changing the arrangements, those can be nice changes sometimes. But I can't take the oversinging. The only song that is \\"reasonable\\" for me is Hark the Herald Angels Sing. Everything else is really forgettable.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I've rented this movie like 4 times both for myself and to show friends who missed it.  I also saw it in the theater.  So yup! I'm a fan.  Love the new cast
B009LREA1S|5.0|Everything about this movie is awesome.  Christian Bale is an outstanding Batman and Anne Hathway nailed the Catwoman character.  The storyline, the effects, the music will definitely keep you entertained.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|Absolutely superb production! Fantastic design of machinery acting as forest, river, rocks, castle. Brilliant voices, first class cast. And immortal Wagner's music performed by Met orchestra directed by Mr Levine and Mr Luisi. The masterpiece!
0316228532|1.0|The book was really more confusing then anything. To many people were introduced at the beginning and the story line seemed to jump around too much. I could not follow the story to make it enjoyable to read. I would consider reading other books written by this author, however I am hoping that they are easier to follow. This story I believe could have been enjoyable if it was more clearly written.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I'm a big fan of Follett and enjoyed this novel mainly for the historical aspects and the characters, but find it hard to believe this is the same author who wrote his previous novels.  The writing is stilted and often amateurish, often with first novelist errors such as having characters tell other characters what they already know in order to tell the reader.  The dialogue is passable, but the narrative sections and point of view switches are awkward.  Get a copy of Pillars of the Earth and compare -- you'll see what I mean.  Best selling authors often have &#34;assistants&#34; writing sections of their novels, but there has to be quality control -- and there wasn't any here.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Excellent movie, lots of actions and excitement. I would highly recommend this move for everyone.  i will be purchasing this movie on Blu Ray.
1400067820|5.0|The only thing you can count on is that things will change. You want to not only survive those changes but get better from them.  The nuns who taught me in high school used to say that whatever doesn't kill you outright only makes you stronger.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Again, I would prefer this to be available as a Prime member, but I wanted to keep up on the story so I bought it for my Fire. As always a good addition to the series.
B0076DELIG|3.0|This is one of the better-paced Connelly books, keeps you on your toes right to the end. The problem is with the end, which leaves too much unexplained and depends of a deus ex machina device.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Love the series and it wasn't available for free so I got it on my Fire.  Free is better, but this wasn't a bad way to see the episode.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Although this is NOT my usual genre, I did enjoy the books (all three) and found it to be quite a learning process.  Had to read it and see what all the &#34;noise&#34; was about.  Liked the third in the series the best.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love this show. It never seems to get old. The only problem with this show is that there isn't enough time in 20ish minutes to highlight each of the characters in a given arc. Such is life though I will go on.<br /><br />I have noticed with this last season that the humor is being based more and more on whats going on in previous episodes. It works well if you are a diehard fan like me but trying to watch it with friends for the first time can involve some explanation. As an example when Sheldon goes to Will Wheaton's house to confront him about Amy in the first episode, Sheldon forgets which knock he is on, because he is drunk. Its a really clever sequence but if you hadn't watched the previous seasons it doesn't make any sense that he forgets what knock he is on.<br /><br />No worries for me though I plan to keep on watching.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed this book and for once Mr. Grisham had a plausable ending to his plot. This one kept me up a few nights!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I am a fan of other crime dramas e.g. Castle, Bones, etc.  I also am a fan of Sherlock Holmes. I love the modern take on Sherlock Holmes. I will admit that reading the stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, I can get a little lost in the references of modes of transportation and techniques that are over a hundred years old. This show helps to bridge that gap, so we are working with cell phones and cars, which is something I can relate to.<br /><br />The acting is great. I love that they chose Lucy Liu for the part of Watson.<br /><br />The story telling is good. The stories are good.<br /><br />I also appreciate the show is relatively clean. The themes can be adult but they don't seem to be trying to push the the envelope with the content.
