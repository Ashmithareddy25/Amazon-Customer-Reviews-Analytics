B005J6LKVI|4.0|After initially being rejected by over 60 publishers, Kathryn Stockett's The Help was finally published in February of 2009.  Since that time, this incendiary tale of the small and not-so-small abuses suffered by black housekeepers in the 1960s has gone on to sell over 5 million copies, as it spent over 100 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List.<br /><br />Set in Jackson Mississippi during the early 1960s, the film tells the story of Skeeter Phelan, a young southern society girl who longs to become a writer.  When Skeeter's beloved housekeeper is suddenly dismissed under pressure from her mother's society friends, Skeeter is concerned and begins to document the stories of her friend's domestic workers.  As one black woman after the next courageously steps forward to tell her tale, the book begins to take shape, and a town will be forever changed.<br /><br />My reaction to this film is somewhat hard to pin down.  On the one hand, I am always drawn to stories where someone has the courage to swim against the stream, and in so doing, brings justice to those that have been oppressed.  These are important stories to tell, for they remind us that change does not often begin in the corridors of power.  Change begins when insignificant people dare to speak prophetic truth into a world that is desperate for truth to be spoken.<br /><br />On the other hand, movies like this sometimes feel \\"safe\\" because they are told from a distance.  Fifty years after the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, how many people would genuinely argue that black people did not suffer under white society?  So it's easy to root for the heroes, demonize the villains, and feel as if  \\"the job is done.\\"  And there is a danger in that feeling as if the \\"job is done\\" because we are encouraged to believe that we can sit safely in the comforts of our own homes.<br /><br />How much more exciting would it be to see a story set in the contemporary world in which someone dared to tell the story of the plight of modern day Native Americans or modern day slaves?  How much more compelling would it be to have to face our own complicit guilt in avoiding the issues and burying our collective heads in the sand?<br /><br />In the end, I strongly recommend viewing The Help, and dare you not cheer as Hilly eats the pie.<br /><br />Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.com.the story of the plight of modern day Native Americans or modern day slaves?

B009MF56GC|5.0|Awesome, over-the-top action flick starring just about everyone in the genre. Stallone's writing and directing is surprising good and the film doesn't take itself too seriously, which is probably why it is so enjoyable. The banter between Stallone's and Statham's character is priceless, and the cameo's from other big stars - Arnold, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, Van Dam - are all just awesome and had the crowd cheering in the theater. Sadly, Jet Li is only in the first action scene and then he leaves the gang : (<br />The blu-ray quality is excellent (as usual) and the digital copy is great to have for iTunes. Screw you UltraViolet!!
B003Y5H5HY|3.0|Literary debuts don't get any bigger than the Millenium trilogy authored by Swedish journalist, Stieg Larrson.  With worldwide sales of over 53 million copies, it was only a matter of time before the books would inevitably be turned into American films.  And when that time came, it was almost equally inevitable that David Fincher, director of thrillers such as Seven, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room, and Zodiac, would be the auteur of choice to helm such nihilistically, dark material.<br /><br />So does the film work?  Sadly, that question is not as easy to answer as one might expect.  On the one hand, Fincher's extensive experience honed over the past 26 years in the industry has taught him how to focus this story, which, in its original printed form, was a bit meandering at times.  Moreover, he knows how to frame a scene, and so, as one would expect, the film looks and sounds stunningly beautiful.  There is a raw elegance in the landscapes he captures that perfectly mirrors the hollow nature of the main characters' souls.  And likewise, the brief, but shockingly potent, bursts of extreme violence are captured in such a way as to actually advance the storyline as opposed to being voyeuristic outlets for those that fancy the emerging genre of \\"torture-porn.\\"<br /><br />So what's missing?  The heart of the novel.  Prior to making its way across the Atlantic, the novel was published in Sweden under the name Man som hatar kvinnor, which translated into English means: Men Who Hate Women.  At its core, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is about misogyny on scales writ both large and small.  While Fincher expertly captures the larger, grotesque acts of violence perpetrated against women, he misses the small acts found in his main character, Mikael Blomkvist.  For you see, in the book, Blomkvist's defining characteristic is his alarmingly, insatiable sexual appetite.  He regularly sleeps with every single major female character in the book, the likes of which include: a woman half his age (Salander), his married co-owner of the magazine he works for, as well as the married niece of the man who hired him to solve the 40-year old cold case.  But here, in Fincher's film, he is only ever shown sleeping with Salander, which completely alters the meaning of the closing scene.<br /><br />*** MILD SPOILER ALERT ***<br /><br />When Salander comes to give Blomkvist a gift at the end of the film, she sees him walking off into the night with his colleague.  And the rage she feels isn't merely the rage of jealousy, as it is in the film.  The rage she feels, in the book, is the rage of having once again been violated by a man who took advantage of her to satisfy his own sexual urges.  In other words, in the book, Blomkvist is among the misogynistic offenders who violate women by their casual willingness to sexually use and discard them.  But here, in the film, it simply comes across as Salander being jealous of a new lover, because Fincher never sees fit to show Blomkvist, the ostensible \\"hero\\" of the film, as guilty in his own way.<br /><br />But this should not come as a surprise in American culture.  For ours is a culture that hypocritically glorifies the sexual promiscuity of men, even as it purports to uphold female dignity and empowerment as a national virtue.  So, in the end, Fincher's curious decision to white-wash his lead character is not surprising, and yet, it is absolutely fatal to the film because it effectively neuters Larrson's central message, and reduces the film to nothing more than a visually splashy who-dunnit shot in exotic locales.  And in a society that openly degrades women in the manner that ours does, this is a shame because Larrson's core theme is one that could really have challenged people to think.<br /><br />Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.com.n half his age (Salander), his married co-owner of the magazine he works for, as well as the married niece of the man who hired him to solve the 40-year old cold case.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I don't buy many 3D movies, but when I do, they are Avatar and the Avengers. Sound and picture quality of this film are incredible, and the 3D gives just a bit more depth to the picture than the standard 2D version. Of course, in this package you get all versions, adn the digital copy is perfect for importing to iTunes. Plenty of extra features to enjoy as well. Totally worth it!
B00664AM5C|4.0|Waiting for her flight in an airport lounge, the adulterous Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow) is feeling a bit under the weather.  But she isn't the only one.  In Hong Kong, a young man wanders back to his apartment, stricken with a delirious fever.  Then there's the Ukrainian model in London, and the Japanese businessman in Tokyo.  All are crashing hard; and so begins director Steven Soderbergh's most recent film, Contagion.  Modeled, in many ways, after his four-time Oscar winning masterpiece, Traffic, this new film is an evocative journey into germaphobe's worst nightmare.<br /><br />What makes this work so well is the casual intersection of stories that veer in and out of focus as the epidemic makes its way around the globe.  Where a lesser director might have succumbed to the desire to voyeuristically pump up the nightmarish body count, Soderbergh wisely shows a few intimate and unexpected deaths before driving the film to more elevated heights where we witness the medical community's valiant attempts to combat a global pandemic.  By avoiding the morbid horror-movie stereotypes, Soderbergh creates something that is far more terrifying: casual, incidental contact.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film as one of the best I've seen in 2011.<br /><br />Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.com.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|How to explain a Terence Malick film to someone who has never seen one?  All at once, they are poetic, rapturous, maddening, illuminating, and even, perhaps, in a few choice moments, a bit pretentious. But one thing is for sure.  No matter what else you one might be tempted to say about a film by this man, you can never say that it is ... expected. Enter Malick's latest offering: The Tree of Life.  Lacking anything that could be conventionally described as a clear or linear storyline, the director, instead, seems utterly content to film a visual meditation on the themes of creation and evolution, fathers and sons, faith and doubt.  It is a story about a particular family rooted in a particular culture, but it's larger than that, more ambitious in its reach.  Perhaps the best way to say it is to say that while this is the story of a family set in the 1950s, it is also the timeless story of humanity and its' God.<br /><br />In his book entitled Faith of the Fatherless: The Psychology of Atheism, psychologist Paul Vitz puts forth an argument in which he suggests that severe disappointment with one's biological father often leads to an individual rejecting the concept of a heavenly Father.  Tracing both the histories of prominent atheists as well as prominent theists, Vitz turns Freud's projection theory of religion on its head, as he makes a compelling case for a correlation between our willingness to conceive of a God that cares and our experiences with fathers that may or may not.<br /><br />In many ways, The Tree of Life is an almost prayerful examination of Vitz's central thesis, filled with wondrous moments of staggering beauty and wrenching snapshots of belittling pain.  And in the end, you can almost hear the words of the Apostle Paul echoing through the narrated voiceover:  \\"There are two ways in life: the way of nature and the way of grace.  You have to choose which one you'll follow.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend The Tree of Life as one of the most audacious and profound films released in this new millennium.<br /><br />Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.com.and profound films released in this new millennium.<br /><br />Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.com.

B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Let's be honest.  The Grey wasn't ever going to be a movie that was marketed towards Christian audiences.  The use of raw, guttural language is only slightly less pervasive than that found in your average Tarantino film.  And as for the violence?  Well, how many Christians typically revel in a film in which the main characters are brutally eliminated in often grotesque fashion by a pack of ravenous wolves?  No.  This is most certainly not Fireproof and it is definitely not Courageous.  This is not filmmaking that is methodically geared to sentimentally reinforce everything a Christian already believes to be true.  This is filmmaking on the level of Roland Joffe's The Mission or Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life.  And for Christians that love the medium of film and for Christians that long for a film to seriously explore the theological problem of pain, The Grey is exactly the kind of movie that you are looking to see.  It's a film that refuses to offer overly-simplistic answers; and it's a film that gives equal voice to both the faithful and the atheist alike.  Consider the words of writer/director Joe Carnahan:<br /><br />\\"If an atheist sees this film, they say, `There's no way [Liam Neeson's character] believes in God.'  [But when] the most hardcore Christian sees this film, they say, `Absolutely he believes in God!' ...  This is the way of the universe and certainly it's the way of nature.  Nothing is given.  Nothing is certain.  And I think that as you get older you start to think about things ... There are things that start to occur to you where you go, `What's out there? What's waiting for me? What's the afterlife look like? Is there an afterlife?'\\"<br /><br />If that kind of mentality doesn't excite you as a Christian fan of film, than this is not likely the movie for you to see.  But if you appreciate harrowing survivalist tales in which man must not only face the demons of nature, but his fragile belief in the existence and goodness of the divine, The Grey is is a must-see.  Raw, uncompromising, and built with a fine-tuned precision towards a beautifully executed smash-cut ending, The Grey should rightfully take its place alongside the very best films of 2012.<br /><br />Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.comis is a must-see.

0307951529|4.0|I have been a serial entrepreneur for over 25 years and have read a LOT of books on entrepreneurship and small business. I found this one to be the best of this new genre of book - with 4 Hr Workweek the most notorious- which purports to tell you how to - for the most part- exploit the possibilities of the internet enabling one to live wherever, work however, and make over 50k per year. There are also numerous blogs and sites flogging guides & schemes to achieve this vision.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Guillebeau's (G) enthusiasm ,clear writing, and lack of hyperbole. I thought his efforts at primary research - though no doubt full of population biases, assumptions, and sampling weaknesses- were laudable. Too many of those in this genre - and in most management books as well- are the recounting of how the author made it work for him, a sample size of 1, and in most cases, is virtually useless unless you are a match with the author. So G's book is already in the top quartile just for having interviewed a spectrum of business owners and tried to draw some broad conclusions and appreciations that will serve others.<br /><br />I happen to like his overarching theme of Go For It. I have seen too many entrepreneurs held back by the hackneyed advice peddled over at SCORE seemingly designed to either paralyze aspiring incipient businessmen or funnel the better heeled - but no more experienced-  to local banks and SBA loans. I love his ideas for bootstrapping a business with little money and a lot of creative effort. The discussions regarding outsourcing alone make this superior to Ferris' 4 Hour Books: I would only add that managing contractors and assistants via Odesk etc. is in itself an energy and time commitment with often less than a satisfactory ROI. I also thought much of his Business Audit and One-Page Business Plan as they are actionable and thoughtful.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended for those new to the notion. There's some overlap with the 4 Hour Week but less hype, more research.<br /><br />On the other column of the ledger, I thought G's examples a bit facile and that some of the case examples lack credibility or are incomplete to key figures or facts e.g. the claims that a toymaker needed to get going presumes machinery, inventory,facilities, and utilities that exceed the $300 mentioned. Some of the businesses including graphic designer, fitness trainer, and bookkeeper would be hard pressed to easily monetize at over 50k.<br />There appears to be an assumption in some of these case studies that there are 'unseen hands' supporting the wantopreneur in his quest. That's ok but it should be made explicit.<br /><br />Here's a few more observations:<br />- All these people in the book have a skill they're selling. If you don't, get one before you go into business. This will involve training and experience; get it and preferably, get paid for it. Working for those who will be your  competition later is a great way to learn.<br />- Have a sponsor: the best is a well-paid spouse or SO that believes in the vision. Otherwise, make up with your parents. If not, resign yourself to saving up a grubstake. Think of Charles Bukowski who when asked how he was able to afford being a writer said,\\" I paid for the writing with my hunger\\". He meant it literally, living on a candybar a day so he could make rent and not work much.<br />- be in it for the long haul: it may take longer than you think. Christopher Plummer didn't get his Oscar till he was 82. Peter O'Toole still hasn't. But...<br />Whatever you vividly imagine, ardently desire, sincerely believe, and enthusiastically act upon must inevitably come to passless hype, more research.<br /><br />On the other column of the ledger, I thought G's examples a bit facile and that some of the case examples lack credibility or are incomplete to key figures or facts e.g. the claims that a toymaker needed to get going presumes machinery, inventory,facilities, and utilities that exceed the $300 mentioned.

0547848412|5.0|I bought this book a few years ago meaning to read it but it just sat on my shelf and I never got to read it. Then I saw that the movie was coming out so I planned to read it before it came out. But that got delayed a little bit because I wanted to listen to it on audiobook from my library. The wait was very long so that is why I haven't finished it until now.<br /><br /> Can I just start off by saying that this book completely took me by suprise. I loved the simpleness of it and how it is such a standard type of story that takes you on an adventure at sea. I didn't think I would give this book a 5 out of 5 stars but the ending completely changed the rating for me. It was completely unexpected when I should have expected it.<br /><br />This is a simple story of a boy lost at sea after a shipwreck with a 450 pound bengal tiger who fights for survival, who wouldn't want to read that story, just to find out what happens. I loved every part of this book. It is broken up into different sections. The before, which tells a history of Pi Patel's family zoo and the life he lived before and his search for religion, which was only simply touched upon. The middle, with the shipwreck and everything that happens. And the after, which is what changed the whole story for me. If you read the book you know what I am talking about, and the ending really renewed my whole sense of why I love this book.<br /><br />Pi Patel was such an amazing character. I loved going on his journey with him and how he had to fight for the courage and strength to survive on that lifeboat. All of the things he had to go through to survive for a long time in the ocean was just a spectacular feat to me. This story truly is \\"a modern classic, combining grand story telling with a profound exploration of ageless themes: faith and truth, fact and fiction, man versus nature and innocence and experience.\\" The ending and Pi's faith in God, are two of the things that really have kept this book in my head after I have read it.<br /><br />I loved that Pi believes in many different religions and keeps his faith through out the book. Also I love how the ending makes you look back at everything that has happened and makes you question it and look at it in a whole different light. In the end, this book lets you have a choice, and everyone gets to believe what they want to believe. I am so glad I read this book and I absolutely recommend it to everyone. If you have even the slightest interest in reading it you must read it because it is definitely worth it.

The cold case that Harry opens in this novel involves a murder from the 1992 L.A. riots in which Harry himself had been called to the scene, but someone else handled the case. In his trademark dogged and consistent manner, Harry follows one lead after another as he tries to solve the case. Harry's persistence survives internal politics that threatens his job. Both new and longtime readers who enjoy well-paced crime fiction with strong character development are those most likely to enjoy this engaging novel.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)

I just bought this book two months ago, and I've read it four (plus) times already.

The animation  and the production design are excellent here, but it doesn't have the gritty feel of the Miller artwork found in the classic graphic novel.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun and addictive game! Try for yourself - it' s free :) Definitely my favourite game at the moment, have played it every day for months.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very entertaining and it reminds me of a game I played as a kid called equestriaud 2000. Definitely a favorite
1451695195|5.0|I had a nde at 17 and its all real I saw an angel when in icu I cried to God for help.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book was very entertaining and even while reading I felt enchanted! The book was written well and I felt like I was transported to that world. Which is why I love the novel. I hope this author writes many more.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I mean it when I say this changed me this book made me really think about how there are all the things we really need to see but we just don't.  Part of me wants to say this is a very bad book because it made me cry. But it was beautiful. And that's all I can really say about it everyone should read this book.
0316223239|5.0|This book is simply marlevous. It is hard enough to get into the mind of a 5 year old, and it is hard enough to get into the mind of a person held captive in a room for their entire life - but to be able to combine the both is a very complex task, which this gifted author handled masterfully.<br /><br />I enjoyed every minute of this book (took me 2 days to read it, becuase I had to sleep as well). It does such a fantastic job avoiding the pitfalls of over dramatization, or prototypical characters.<br /><br />very very intelligently written. many of my friends said they rather avoid this book baucuse they would find it difficult reading such a shocking story. However - The writer does a great job of not making it shocking, or at least not too shocking. it is disturbing, of course, but not to much so that you can't handle it.<br /><br />You simply fall in love with Jack, and everything that happens to him and his mom throughout the book is very believeable - the bad things are not shockingly horrific, and the good things are far from being described as ideal.<br /><br />in short - a must read. 5 starts without blinking!
B000HF6XV8|5.0|A superb classic story made into a movie equally fabulous! Both the movie and the book are favorites!  Well done!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|What else is there to say? Martin's Game of Throne series is simply fabulous. I recommend the Kindle edition especially, because there are soooo many characters that I find myself using the search feature a lot!<br /><br />I should note that all the books are full of R-rated material, so if that bothers you, think twice about getting these books.
B001SGEUNI|3.0|Halestorm is amazing. If you like Lacuna Coil or Evanesence then you would most definately love this. They are an angrier version of them.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|The app works but is very slow.  Won't print pictures imbedded in emails.  When printing emails it just prints the body text and nothing else.  I haven't tried printing files from Word.
B000URDEB0|3.0|Nightwish is such a wonderful band. They are amazing live just like their CDs. If you like folk music with a twist you will love this.
B008G59IKO|5.0|I am a huge Green Day fan. I was a little disappointing with some of the reviews of the album but I love it. I can't get enough. It one catchy beat after another. Reminds me of some songs on nimrod album. Flows great with Uno.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Once again I love this show. I cannot wait until the next season. I watch at least the full season of the prior year's season or more every year before the new season starts. Can't wait for this years marathon!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I chose this book on a whim. Yes, there is a missing person at the center of the novel. but the book is mostly a dissection of then &#34;perfect&#34; marriage gone awry. I vacillatedd between loving and hating each of the characters. As House says in is eponymnos TV show, 'Everybody lies&#34;. True here as well. Hard to know who's the bad guy and who's the good guy. Plus,,it is beautifully written--kept writing passages in my writer's notebook for inspiration. Her 1st novel isn't as strong, but I bet #2 is n stronger, leading up to the brilliance of &#34;Gone Girl&#34;
B000P2A256|3.0|Great band! Great CD! I own every album & love every bit of every one of them. If you like one republic you will like them.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|If you are a fan of les mis, then this is a must see!  1985 cast joins current cast after final bows.....and they sing together!
B0086700CM|3.0|I love this game. It is the first game I bought on my Kindle Fire & I love it! It is intense & very fun.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A friend told me about this book. When I first started reading it I thought I had the wrong book. This was the best book I have ever read. I strongly recommend this book.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I love this artist. She is so wonderful. This music came out of nowwhere, but I love it. If you like Mariah Carey then you love this.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I always enjoy Michael Connelly's books, starring Harry Bosch. The characters all have great depth and I almost forget that I'm reading a novel. When I had to put The Black Box down, I couldn't wait to pick it up again.
B005HSL626|3.0|This is a fun game that is a no brainer. It is nice to take your mind off of things & do something like this.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|JUst a plain old fun game, Strategy and laughter addicting to play time slips away AAA+ fun , , ,

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Nice game lots of games to choose from plenty of games to play never gets boring I give it five stars
0143038419|1.0|I borrowed it from the Library after having watched the movie (which I loved) and im so glad I did. I mean, this book is just a self pity-fest that the author decided to celebrate in Italy, India and Indonesia. Geesus, I cant even say anything else besides WATCH THE MOVIE - is much better than the actual book, which is rare, but when an author craves people's pity that much its just disgusting to read.<br /><br />Not to offend anybody, but this is a very American book ( I realize not everyone is like that) in the sense that their problems seem to be bigger than the poor children starving in Africa and the poor people in North Korea. Its all about her her her her - seriously, whats funnier is that she is jammed packed with money too to be able to afford psychologists and all, PLUS SHE IS THIRTY...you know?. I think even a 10 year old wouldnt act like this. Instead she choses to bother poor little Ketut and force Wayan to buy a house without respecting her views on the place. Bali was the only part I fully read and it was just because I wanted to know more about all the other characters.<br /><br />Seriously, if I could give this half a star or NO stars at all, it would be much better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you don't have this app then you should get it you will love feeding and caring for your horse.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I like the story as it is different from most that are out there. It works great on my KD. The graphics are beautiful. The puzzles are fun. I haven't finished the game but am really enjoying it.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Did not enjoy this book as much as other books.<br />Found subject matter unpleasant.<br />But I do like<br />kindle format.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think Jeff Kinney is a great author for developing children in grades 4-8. The diary of a wimpy kid series is great
B002APU580|5.0|Have watched this movie several times and will probably watch it several more times in my life. Keira Knightley is a gem, the music, costumes and settings are magnificent and a classic story line make this a study in how to make a great period drama. Highly recommend.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|It was incredible what this girl went through and how she survived,it is an inspiration for everyone who has ever gone through any hardships in life.
B006RXPTNM|4.0|Interesting story with rock solid performances all around and a timely story line. Streep has the ability to play any role and make it believable, despite her star status, and this is no exception. Definitely worth a watch.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app has spoiled me and now I only want to watch videos in at least 720 p. Works great<br />.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Always a joy to watch Johnny Depp, and the role of Barnabas Collins is a good one for him, but overall the movie lacks any solid storyline, the performances aside from  Depp are weak and it's a disappointing effort by Tim Burton, who seems much better at animated flicks than live.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Really enjoying this season. The characters are explored and grow this season.  Great acting  and writing all around. We look forward to every episode.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Weak, contrived story line based on the fairy tale, but barely recognizable. Unimpressive acting, the ending is weak and anti-climatic, some of the dialog is impossible to understand, and Kristen Stewart is her usual expressionless self. Some of the special effects are impressive, but not enough to recommend the movie.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Love watching this movie, and all the extra items that came with it are a nice bonus! You won't be disappointed!
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|This first album by Phillips reflects the style and great vocalizations that made him my favorite during the Idol competition.  He has a unique delivery and I really enjoy every cut on this record!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Good movie, not predictable well worth seeing. good selection of actors and the CG melds well with actual filming. The filmakers take you on a ride and leave you off at the end
B00005JLCI|5.0|The acting by Kate Winslet and Kenneth Branagh, and an all star cast brings this play tastefully into the modern world
B004SIIBGU|5.0|one of my two favorite shopping places, great app! easy to place, easy to use from a very wonderful site.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|If you have born in the sixties and started  to learn computer science with Fortran and punching cards, then started to use an Apple II, and an IBM PC It's a fascinating history.
0871404133|5.0|Dr Wilson has done another groundbreaking work. He is so accessible to the non scientist (me) Put down your religious tracts and pick up Conquest
B007BFSYMS|2.0|Doesn't seem to be a way to shut off. No way to exit. Have to manually kill the app. Please correct.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|nice way to waste time. fun and silly, a great feel good destraction. only down side are the intrusive adds on the free edition..
B0051ERJBI|5.0|it sound so blast, but i think the band continous the ultra fast way and the recording is so new era..... death metal bands, but lock up kick a.................
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|This is Bad Religions best album to date.  It's true that a couple of the songs riffs sound similar to some on previous albums but it's only for a few seconds.  Hello Cruel World and Robin Hood in Reverse are fantastic.  I can't stop listening to it.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|First it took well over an hour to download. I finally got to the first hidden object scene and couldn't select anything. I could see the items but any amount of tapping did nothing, not even the menu button or the back arrow on my Kindle. I had to press the home button to get out of it.<br /><br />I uninstalled and re-downloaded and this time it took less than 15 minutes but I still couldn't tap on anything.<br />Very disappointed as it sounded like a good game, acording to the reviewers that actually were able to play it.<br /><br />Kindle Fire.
B009CCBCU4|2.0|I just could not get into this book. I have no explanation except that it just did not click for me. I deleted it from my Kindle in the middle of the first chapter. Perhaps I'm just not that interested in the era.
0385363133|5.0|Other than some redundacy, I really enjoyed the book.  Could do with a little less sex, but the story and the interaction between the characters was wonderful  I think the 2nd book is my favorite of the 3.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids and I love this game! This game is very entertaining, my kids like the ability to change characters!
0385363141|5.0|So glad for a good ending to this very good story.  It's one of the best love storied I've ever read.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|The movie is really good.  The cast did a great job.  I wasn't a big fan of the shaky camera effect, which seemed almost worse in this movie than the other Bourne movies, but since it was in the other movies, I kind of expected it.  My only big complaint is the ending.  As soon as it ended, I was left with the &#34;that's it?&#34; feeling.  I was expecting there to be more.  At least with the other movies there was an actual mission that you can pinpoint, but this one didn't really have any resolution or even a hint at the story continuing on in the rest of the trilogy since this was a prequel.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book had me held in within the first few pages. Could not put it down. Well written. Kid's connection with everyone really mattered .  I will definitely suggest this book to anyone.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|This is just a typical action type movie it was good though, I liked it. I also liked Clash of the Titans.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Best one yet.. really fell In love with the book! It was really romantic and lovely.. wish there was more to the series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoyed figuring out a few and then showed my seven year old granddaughter, and she kept at it for a long time.. Good way to pass the time when waiting for something.. It made her think a bit and she liked the challenge. No problems downloading or playing.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I like this album, its just i need a refund because i forgot that i had this album itunes and i need the gift card funds for my airsoft stuff
B00846REIS|4.0|Not as good as 50 shades, but still a good read. Gideon Cross is no Christian Grey. I would recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I am color blind so it does not work for me flow free is a color based game. I hate it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a great book. Couldn't put it down. Keeps you interested the entire time. Almost wish this could have been made into a series, kinda sad that it's over.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really loved this book. It was so good I couldn't stop reading it. This is probably the best book I've ever read
B008K8VDPU|4.0|My daughter loves this app.  She likes that you can save a song that you create.  It's cool that she can &#34;play&#34; piano even when she isn't by her piano!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|First off this is great. I thought the first part was good but oh my. I can't wait to read the third one.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The premise of the story was good and believable.The characters were shallow and not very well developed as was the storyline.I don't really need a twisted ending or a surprise ending to enjoy a book,but this just had nothing to hang onto or enjoy.Very pedestrian.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was awesome. I really want to see the movie. Now i'm looking for the moment when i feel infinite &#60;3
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|A great compilation of the songs from the movie. Deluxe edition has songs from the other groups as well. Great CD.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|This app works as stated. The price was right for this one. It has plenty of sounds to choose from and comes with usable sounds already. I am enjoying it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|tobuscus I.s awesome!. hes really funny. he puts up new videos every Monday. oh wait I just realised this isn't for tobuscus... this is awkward
B003AVPV1O|1.0|This product idea was suggested to me by my technical adviser thinking it was for one screen.  It wrecked my pc. Had to have repairs and would never use such a device again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|What a great ending. It was so full of action and suspense. My favorite of the trilogy!<br />Perfect love story.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I found this to be a very handy app! I use it daily and I highly recommend it! try it you'll like it!
B000VL9XE2|5.0|After beginning to experiment with their sound, most bands opt for one of two choices the next time around: A) They go back to bludgeoning basics just to please their old-school fans; or b) they realize that they're on to something (as their likely-high record sales would indicate), and so they choose to continue down that road. In the case of New Jersey's The Dillinger Escape Plan, the band has always been \\"experimental\\" (if 2002's short-player \\"Irony Is A Dead Scene\\" wasn't, then I don't know what it was!). But they only first started to dabble with melodic (and often Trent Reznor-esque) vocals and keyboards on 2004's long-awaited \\"Miss Machine.\\" So what do TDEP choose to do now?<br /><br />The answer to that is both of the above options. Their third full-length release, 2007's \\"Ire Works\\" offers both melodic songs, and brutal, frenzied grindcore blasts (which usually hover within the one-to-two-minute length). Therefore, it is a genre-bending, shape-shifting, and wildly innovative mix of both their two previous full-lengths, 1999's grindcore-leaning debut \\"Calculating Infinity,\\" and the already-noted \\"Miss Machine.\\"<br /><br />\\"Fix Your Face\\" is a brutal, jarring, and lightning-fast opening blast that should satisfy just about all old-school fans, with its frenetic pace, brutal musicianship, and esophagus-shredding vocals. (Greg Puciato cries \\"It's like a deer in the headlights, baby!\\" over muscular bass lines and manic guitar and pummeling drum blasts.) \\"Lurch\\" continues down the same path set forth by the opener, barreling forward with careening speed, knife-to-your-eardrums riffs, and time-signature-torturing tempo changes. However, \\"Black Bubblegum\\" is the first blatant stab towards commercialism. It is an overtly mainstream ballad highlighted by memorable melodic hooks, docile clean guitars, and sweet falsetto clean singing that I wouldn't be surprised to hear if I was flipping through the radio-dial one day soon. Because suffice it to say, it has all of the ingredients necessary to be a surefire hit single. \\"Sick On Sunday\\" is another gentle, melodic number complete with impressive, pensive clean singing and techno-industrial knick-knacks (including some keyboards and electronic blips).<br /><br />Then, following a captivatingly cool, moody, and futuristic-sounding oasis track (\\"When Acting As A Particle\\"), the album briefly returns to its brutal roots. \\"Nong Eye Gong\\" is a short tech-metal freak-out akin to the opening two tracks; but when considering this blitzkrieg came after tracks three, four, and five, it seems like it is made even more brutal and edgy. It savagely tears the listener's head off and constantly abuses his or her eardrums, and features some especially vicious and dissonant bellowing. \\"N.E.G.\\" is then followed up by another cool and trippy, electronic, Skinny Puppy-light interlude (\\"When Acting As A Wave\\"), before the band again dive headlong back into brutality. \\"82588\\" is another particularly unnerving, explosive, caustic, and violent attack, a complete onslaught of cork-screwing guitar and bass lines, frantic drumming, and wicked, crazed vocal howling.<br /><br />But things then take another turn back toward the commercial side of the line, as \\"Milk Lizard\\" is a much more restrained, in-control, accessible, and normal-sounding tune. It lays more warm crooning (including some soulful choruses that really let Greg show off the extent of his lungs) against a restrained groove, and some nicely melodic guitar soloing (in the background). And the fleeting-use of pianos also peppers the arrangements, but it is so brief that you might very well miss it. And then, after \\"Party Smasher,\\" another tech-metal sneak-attack which overflows with more frenetic and blistering guitar work, we are treated to \\"Dead As History,\\" a spectacularly progressive piece.<br /><br />And the proceeding \\"Horse Hunter\\" (which features a cameo from Mastodon's Brent Hinds) splits the difference between the two above-described songstyles, opening as a really brutal and math-y track before settling down and adopting an almost pop-punk-like vibe, with a melodic, groove-oriented section and angelic-sounding backing vocals. And the epic \\"Mouth Of Ghosts\\" wraps it all up nicely, with its superbly progressive mood, smooth, melodically flowing bass lines, ethereal piano splashes, and reverberating guitar strums.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted, there is absolutely no \\"Ire\\" necessary for you to feel when listening to this album. In fact, there is no reason to have anything else but good feelings towards \\"Ire Works.\\" Yes, there is some melodic fair, here, but only enough to brilliantly texture the arrangements. And as you can clearly see, there is plenty of stuff present throughout this thirteen-song set to make any old-school fan avoid feeling alienated. \\"I.W.\\" is, quite simply, a masterful effort, but hey, that shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody who has already been subjected to The Dillinger Escape Plan's back discography. Because they already know that this band mastered the art of the masterpiece long ago.styles, opening as a really brutal and math-y track before settling down and adopting an almost pop-punk-like vibe, with a melodic, groove-oriented section and angelic-sounding backing vocals.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this book the characters we so real. I could not stop reading it. He does a wonderful job of integrating history and story telling!
178022219X|5.0|Our book club discussion drew the most people ever in attendence. The discussion was the longest and most thoughtful ever. This story and it's well written telling kept everyone interested in the themes, characters and values.<br />The author skillfully combined facts and fiction, obviously detailed and drawn from his personal experiences. We left the discussion still wondering who what and why.<br />Some of the concepts here are easily mistaken for facts and do not exist in the real legal world yet. Junk science is sometimes mistaken for the truth.<br />Well worth the read for its entertainment and intellectual value. This is probably the most praise you can give today's contemporary novels.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Loved this as a follow up! I can hardly wait for the third book! The development of the characters was very well done and the story is such a deep and wonderful continuing saga! Loved the writing and character development.
B0027BOL4G|3.0|I was interested in this documentary \\"Food, Inc.\\" not because of accolades heaped on the movie - it was also Oscar nominated - but because of the overwhelming response from the viewers. Nearly 1,000 reviews on Amazon site! Now that I watched Robert Kenner's documentary film and I think I was pretty disappointed with the film for the following two reasons.<br /><br />Narrated by two famous authors Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser, the film offers inside view into the American food industry that is often shocking, but I think \\"Food, Inc.\\" is trying to bite off more than it can chew. Food poisoning cases alone, especially those caused by E. coli O 157 (often deadly for children), deserve more time.<br /><br />Another problem I found with the film is something related to most recently made documentaries: tendency for dramatization, or the usual \\"good-guy vs. bad-guy\\" conflict. We are asked to take one side of the argument, which is easy to do, but that doesn't make us really think about the issue that could be more complicated and messy than some of the film's interviewees suggest.<br /><br />I was not impressed with \\"Food, Inc.\\" probably because I have seen Nikolaus Geyrhalter's \\"Our Daily Bread\\" first. The film does not tell: it just shows. It is slow and some might find it boring, but to me its fascinating visuals are more convincing.
193609648X|3.0|The photos are fabulous the patterns are almost invisible though it would be wonderful if only I could see theme  the printing is so pale I needed to photo copy the patterns and darken them just to make the beautifull shawl on the cover.
0316227706|5.0|My 8 year old daughter saw this in the school library and ran home to order it. She loves dogs and was thrilled to get a book filled with underwater photos of goofy looking dogs usually trying to grab a ball.<br /><br />They are sweet, funny, bizarre, and endearing. The photo quality is wonderful and I can't imagine how many shots he had to take to get these wonderful pictures.<br /><br />A great book with a bunch of super sweet dogs in a large variety of breeds. You'll never look at dogs the same way again!

B008I43DYU|4.0|I've got two Hewlett Packard Scientific Calculators and three desktop computers in the house and so If I am really sitting down to do some serious calculations, I'd probably not pick up the Kindle.  That said, the calculator is easy to read and very similar to the standard Windows scientific calculator.  I might be tempted to use this in the workshop as the sealed Kindle unit is going to be pretty immune to sawdust.  If all you have is some small four function calculator that you use for you budgeting this is a lot nicer easy to read in bright light and the keys are big enough to hit reliably.  The colors on the Kindle Fire are attractive.  I find the Kindle a bit addictive and it may turn out that I use this more often than I would have thought.  Regards,  Cliffc

B006LSZECO|2.0|From the beginning, this book felt like it tried too hard to be clever when the story really didn't warrant cleverness.  I found it painful to read through the various stages.  And not to spoil the fun for those who actually might enjoy reading it, but I need to say that, even if I had been enjoying it, the ending would have fixed that for me.
0062127241|3.0|interesting but lacks in language. so its h ard to keep the inspiration going through the book. Better language should have been secured by the editor.
B000X3VN46|5.0|Love this cd, they did a great job and of course the music is wonderful!  Tarja seems to have done ok on her own, though I will always believe she was better with Nightwish.  She gave their music depth that the current singer never will.<br /><br />Suffice to say this is a great product and I love it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a dense yet easy-to-read work. As a more than competent historian Goodwin skillfully relates the story, weaving in people, battles, locations with well researched details. Until this book I could never appreciate the battle portions of the Civil War or the various military leaders. It is not a quick read for sure but so pleasurable. As we approach February and commemorate Lincoln's birthday, I personally have benefited from what I have learned from this scholarship. There is a sense in her effort that you are actually in the presence of these events watching them unfold. She has written with great skill.

B007BFSYMS|4.0|There's not a lot to complain about with this app. It does what it advertises.<br /><br />I am nagged by the alarm clock. It's obviously not the main concern of the developer but that doesn't mean a little work on its ease of use would be a bad thing. In fact, I think it would greatly enhance the value of White Noise &amp; could warrant adding an extra buck to the price.
B005R9HK8O|2.0|Obviously a very popular and epic book; in my opinion, not so much because of what it offers in the way of spiritual understanding, but more that it is the book that launched the career and life of one of the 20th century gurus. I am positively focused toward that era, and, I am constantly looking for any insight into the meaning of life I might find. I know he is considered a spiritual powerhouse, and I thought the book might awaken me. Perhaps my expectations were too high, or perhaps I am just not inspired by this particular path. It may be that I am not attuned to the delivery of the message; for whatever reason, the pages left me wanting.<br /><br />The book is well written, it is dated in its format and message, but anyone reading it should know that going in. As I said, it is considered an epic work, by a spiritual powerhouse. If you have interest in this particular message, and messenger, then I believe it is important to begin here. However, his later works are more refined and focused to the age we now find ourselves in.
0307719774|4.0|I received this journal as a gift. I like the smaller size, it doesn't take up much room on my nightstand. Also, the limited amount of space to answer each question makes you pause and really think about what you're about to write. I agree with other reviewers that the questions at times seem elementary, but that doesn't bother me. I think that my answers may very well be different five years from now. All in all, a fun and convenient way to measure the passage of time!
B001F12J0C|5.0|What can I say?  It's the best!  How could you not love these movies?  With this DVD 3-pack, my friends and I can get together, make some great snacks, and watch all three Bourne movies in a row.  Now that's my idea of fun.  This was sold by Amazon, so the price was right and the delivery was quick.  Way to go, Amazon.
1609611543|4.0|My first week I lost 1 lb. on to week two. Feeling much better, I don't crave as much and eat as much. Very surprising since I am always craving and eating. I think this book will help me on my weight loss.

B0049J0CTM|5.0|Sweet story for children and adults alike.  Good life lessons. Lots of good humor - I would rent it again and again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had just finished reading Gone Girl, which was amazing, and I was looking for a book with equal quality.  Hopeless was just as good, if not better!  After the first few pages, I didn't want to put it down!
0756405890|5.0|It's an amazing book and was also in good condition. Good for anyone looking for a new fantacy book with adventure and an excelent story.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great.  Made me cry.  This is one of the best books I've ever read.  The description in Amazon does not do it justice.  i put off buying it for months.  Glad I finally did.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|The story does an extremely proficient job of explaining how the internet infrastructure is open to a terrorist attack should the wrong people put their minds to it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is so cool like you really own your own restaurant but I have one regret the pop ups my 4 daughters and my 2 twin boys  were often bored so my oldest daughter got restaurant story and my middle daughter and my second oldest were playing it on there tablet when a pop up came up every five minutes asking if they wanted to buy 10,000,000 gems for 45 dollars thank God my sister saw it from were she was sitting on the couch but everything else I have no problem.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I think that this should be your 1st and last place a very to get a great alarm clock app .
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This final installment of this particular trilogy was great. It had all elements that makes a great book plus you finally can see the main character as a Man with feelings, emotions, sorrow and love.Human after all<br />Great opportunities for unlimited story telling from many angles in the future.I  can not wait for the return of?Agent Pendersgast and without spoiling the books for the ones who are yet to read it ,his new&#34; associates&#34;.
B000002KHH|4.0|Whereas the first album had a couple real standouts, this has several and the \\"filler\\" songs are much better than before. They really had it going on all cylinders on this one and I'm looking forward to continuing thru their catalog.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Love the series, love the author, and best of all I love that I could get it on my Kindle right away with no wait.
B0000028M7|4.0|Alice and Chains had everything going for them while recording this album, except for some or all of the members being addicted to heroin. The record company was supporting them so they had time in the studio and fans were dying to buy it when it came out. All of the songs are good and about half are really good. It's heavy and melodic like Facelift but just slightly better in every way. Unless you prefer the less produced music because these songs have been studio massaged.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't give away the details! I bought book one and finished the first and the second within days. Fantastic
0062101897|5.0|This book is BIG and very interesting.  I found it by accident and ordered it from the FREE Library..........then I sent it to my Son, Granddaughter and the Mom.  I think they will really enjoy it and have it forever...............so for a gift send the real book.  It was way worth it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is all the fun of having a pet horse but not messy I think anyone who likes animals should defiantly get this game

B00A2XU9IS|5.0|This is a fun way to countdown the days to Christmas.  There is a small puzzle to do each day.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|This program nags you to rate it. It doesn't stop reminding you until you do. So here is my review.  This might be a good app to relax with, but right now I'm just annoyed. How many words am I supposed to type here. Have I reached the 20 word minimum yet?  Have I mentioned that this is stressing me out?
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I originally got a pair of these when i enrolled in an audio engineering program at university. Those have since worn out, and I bought a new pair. These are an industry standard, and the quality shows. I use these headphones daily. they are comfortable, solid, sound excellent, have a flat eq response, and a long cord. Most excellent.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|I love all of Jeff Kinney's books.  this one is still another one showing the depth of knowledge he has about what goes on in  minds of young boys growing up,.  I wait expectanly for the next book.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The character development and plot twists makes all of these books not only stimulating, but suspenseful and riveting. I am sad that the trilogy is finished.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I am an adult and I read these books with great enthusiasm.  They are a delight to me so I can just imagine how much the young people enjoy them.  It can really relate to what they are experencing presently.  It brings back memories for me, so I know how much more in tune it is now.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I am relatively new to the digital world, have converted from film cameras two years ago. My big problem was with the built in flash on my digital Nikon. While good for most applications, definitely not sufficient for portraits, weddings or any other application where control of the light is an issue. This flash has a great range and because it has a bounce feature makes it ideal for many situations where diffusion, or red eye, or reduction of shadows is needed. It also is economical to operate and a set of batteries lasts a good long time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Thank you Colleen Hoover.  I just finished the book and I can't stop sobbing.  While the tears I was crying a few chapters ago were from gut-wrenching heartache, the tears that are flowing now are from overwhelming bliss at having had the honor to read your story.<br /><br />It was funny, witty, smart, SEXY, breathtaking, heart-stopping, beautiful, painful and just plain PERFECTION.<br /><br />Holder.  There are no words.  Seriously...nothing I say can explain how incredible he is.  My favorites had been Mr.Darcy, #1 and Edward Cullen, #2.  I know this is Twilight blasphemy but I have to tell the truth...Holder is now #2.  (Mr. Darcy will never be removed from his position because in my opinion, he is the character that started it all and that all romance aspires to.)<br /><br />The chemistry between Holder &Sky is so electric that it makes the relationship between Twilight's Edward & Bella just a sweet little puppy love.  My heart was bursting out of my chest & I couldn't breathe.  Uh-Ma-Zing.<br /><br />Do not question it, just buy it.  It will easily be in your top 5 favorite books of all-time.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to read book one, then when I completed it, I couldn't wait to get book two, so when I purchased it, I also purchased three. The characters in this story are so interesting and deep, you can't wait to find out what they are going to do next or what part of their past you're going to discover.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A friend recommended this book to me and I admit I took a long time before I finally decided to give it a try. Then I was hooked!! Couldn't put it down. Quickly read two and three as well. Very sexy . . .
B00AFWEPVI|2.0|I do not need a personal camera that only takes pictures of me.  it would be nice if it had a lense that could be reversed.
B008M36EEI|3.0|My girlfriend likes to watch as many as possible of the Golden Globe and Oscar nominated movies before the awards ceremonies.  Since I did not recall this movie being at the theaters, I was dubious.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was not the best movie I saw in the past year, but it was better than I expected.
B004X2M3SI|5.0|This is my favorite season of all from the doctor, specially the last episode.  It made me cry.  It took a while to like this doctor but I love him now.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Amazing production of the Phantom! If you are a Phan you will LOVE this DVD. The Phantom is captivating, Christine is exhillerating, Raoul is amazing and La Carlotta....well she's La Carlotta. Whether you are familiar with the story or not this will make you want to go to NY or London and see it live. And then watch it over and over again. The music is spectacular. Probably one of if not THE best of ALW.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have this app on my kindle....luv it ! So much more convenient then the regular battery monitors !<br />Planning on downloading it for my droid next.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|I LOVE the Phantom of the Opera. But I don't know if it was the story line or the acting or the singing or the songs. It was just not what I expected. I understand it was meant to be different but all the main characters are the same (except for one... but I wont spoil that for you, it is a twist in the story that could have worked if the rest of it were different) 10 years later and you would think there would be SOME relation to the original. Nope, just a faint hint of the music of Masquerade to make you recall the original but definitely NOT a sequel and not meant to be. It will still leave you hanging. I think for me and many others who did not like this production the reason we watched it was because we had hoped the Phantom and Christine would have finally gotten together. It was just heart breaking to see Phantom cry at the end of the first one and Christine just walk away and run off with Raoul. The Phantom also is pretty wimpy in this one. He was just not the Phantom we have grown to love and Raoul was a mean controlling drunk. Not very creative in my honest opinion. I would stream it first as a rental before I buy it if I were you. Just saying.
0062200909|5.0|I have several art books from movies I've enjoyed because they always give such a great behind the scenes look at a movie, from concept to final product. The Hobbit Art and Design book has really stood out as a fantastic source of extra information about the movie as well as the amazing design that went into making all of the characters, backdrops, and props. As I was reading it, I kept coming across more and more interesting information and little hidden gems I never would have noticed in the movie. It's incredible to see how much went into the making of each character and how their final designs came to life. The art is fantastic, the wealth of extra information (such as a deleted scene that apparantly revolved around a very young Bilbo meeting Gandalf when he was a child) is truly interesting, and the insights onto the sets and props used just make the movie experience all the richer. Somehow knowing that each dwarf is carrying specially created sewing kits which we may never even see just helps to make the characters more deeply believable. If you want to know more about the making of The Hobbit, love the art of the movie, or know someone who is a Tolkien fan, I highly recommend this book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|More challenging than you first think. Nice variety of puzzles. Graphics were all<br /> great.<br />Very enjoyable. Found it hard to put down.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|What can I say? It's Brave. It was an amazing movie in the theater and a great buy as a DVD. The little extra movies are incredibly cute and it's well worth it to get the extra commentary. Over all, if you're even looking at this DVD, you probably already saw the movie and liked it. So what are you waiting for? Go buy the thing.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|every time i try to get on my screen turns black and goes to home page. except  the tirzt time i had used it
B008ALAHA4|4.0|Was good excellent quality but was not what i expected to work whit my apple and new charger just that

B00B59H6EI|5.0|My 17 year old daughter and I love to spend our evenings with Amazon Prime watching shows from Season 1, Episode 1, all the way through, a few an evening.  Our latest is Supernatural.  We love it!  Neither of us are fans of the gory squishy splitting body scenes.  We look away, but the sounds!!  Anyway, while I've seen some reviewers who are disappointed that it isn't all gory action and wild special effects, it appears we're in the majority when we say that we simply love the complete package.  The story lines are great.  We really miss Bobby. But aside from that really awful part, the show remains fresh and new with each episode. We're almost caught up now and have been buying Season 8.  In a vain attempt to try to keep it from ending, we're watching more Primevil than Supernatural for a bit.  But those last 5 episodes are calling to us and we'll get to the \\"watch one a week\\" part all too soon.<br /><br />We highly recommend Supernatural.  It pulls you in and makes you pay attention, it's just that good.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I recently found this (thanks to easy a and pitch perfect) and I realized just how awesome these movies are. Between this and Ferris Bueler, I've found two new favorites this year! Wish these kind of movies came out more often! Funny and meaningful in all the right places!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is one of those books that you read through, and then want to read again just to watch the plot develop over and over. You will really feel for all of the characters as all of them are in a hard position. I literally laughed and cried while reading this book. The author has done her research on spinal cord injuries and those that care for them. 5 stars!
B008G12ERC|3.0|But...I only liked 4 songs off the album. However the cloud download provided free with purchase from Amazon really came in handy I didn't have to wait for the physical disc to arrive I was able to load on my Ipod and enjoy my music right away.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I saw this when I was younger - thinking it was something else (the folly of youth).  Later I came to appreciate the film for the strong story it told (in my mind) and for the great acting and dancing that I came to expect of Patrick Swayze.
B001HN69AY|4.0|I leik dis mooovy. it good moovy. you buy moovy too. why you not buy mooovy yet? do it. NOW!
B0000714BP|5.0|My wife and I both love this movie for many reasons.  One - is a great comedic flick - two - it is a great &#34;buddy&#34; movie - three - it is also a great lesson in life and of strong values.  You want to cheer at the end - even if you forget who is who.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My daughter downloaded this game for me. I am glad she did because it is fun. I really enjoy playing it. The animation makes it entertaining.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book does not end up being what you originally think it will be, it has you going whhaaaaattt? multiple times throughout the book. Very well written. Had to put it down a couple times because it was so intense but still just an amazing book.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I downloaded Adobe onto my Kindle Fire but have yet to use it. I thought I would need it for my emails and school. I am sure I will be using it sometime in the very near future.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|So much of this book seemed like 50 Shades of Grey, just with more drawn out (I know that didn't seem possible) and irrational story line. Still read both, but didn't love it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow! This is a hard book to put down. Ever since I started reading it, I don't want to do anything else. I can't wait to read the rest of them.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|The player is kind of cheezy. No power cord so you WILL go through batteries if you have a lot of dubbing to do. The CD for installing is a free program you get on line. The CD that is supplied is outdated.<br />If you have a cassette player that has an outlet to hook up to a USB to your computer, and you download Audacity you can do this.<br />I tried to put in some rechargeable batteries, they don't fit. ???<br />It is convenient because it has the cord, but be aware that the USB that is supplied is only just over 20 inches in length.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I love this movie. Gizmo is so cute. I haven't had a chance to watch the movie yet but will probably do so this weekend.
B00A7OJ0DC|3.0|...couldn't even out this script.  BURN!<br /><br />Seriously, though, when did the mediocre start getting lumped with the great?  When did the bar drop low enough so that such hefty praise could be tossed at such a middle-of-the-road kid's movie?  Or has it always been that way, and I've just been naive?  These are questions that I feel are important to ask, apparently.<br /><br />So, the long and short of it is, Wreck-it Ralph is Toy Story if it had been made by middle of the road film-makers.  After the lights go out in an arcade in some 'Anytown, USA' the video game characters are free to roam and wander and live their own lives.  After 30 years of doing the daily grind of being a video game villain, Ralph (voiced tenderly and effectively by John C. Riley) is going through something of an existential crisis - he no longer wants to be the hated villain and longs for some respect and social acceptance. It's not a new story, but this is a new and fun venue for it.  And the opening 20 minutes are pretty engaging - the characters are lively and colorful, the world behind the arcade is interesting and pretty well laid out, there's some fun nostalgic exploitation moments.  Strong stuff overall.<br /><br />The problems start when, you know, the PLOT finally kicks in.  Apparently, in this universe, hero's get medals at the end of video games... I've never known that to happen but, whatever, that's what they're going with.  So, through some contrived social contracts, Ralph decides HE needs a medal to finally be accepted.  This is where the movie starts to spin its wheels (PUN!) as the quest for a medal takes Ralph into a candy-coated racing game.  Here he meets a troubled young racer and the 2nd plot starts as we forget about the silly medal business and go about correcting some of the shenanigans here in Annoying Obnoxious Racing World.  Seriously, it's the least interesting place in the movie, with the least interesting characters and it's where we spend two-thirds ofour time.  On top of that, the script starts getting muddled and we're introduced to a host of new 'rules' just to keep things moving forward ('glitches' can't leave their own game, for some reason.  The king can rewrite the game code, to a point) so much so that it starts to feel like playing a game with a little kid, who keeps making up new rules just so the game can keep going or, you know, they can keep winning.  Layer on a few sub-par performances by Ken-the-Intern and, ugh, Sarah Silverman and things drift from clever and engaging to just mostly bearable.<br /><br />But... those folks at Disney are no slouches, and they know how and when to hit he most important marks.  The visuals are slick and modern and imaginative, making the most of pixilation and other cute, fun video game idiosyncrasies.  There are some really fun and exciting sequences throughout and some tightly done action.  The emotional highpoints still, somehow, resonate which I was very surprised by.  After an hour of being entirely bored I still found myself choked up at points late in the second and late in the third acts, and that counts for a lot.  It's a little manipulative, but they push all the right buttons at the right times to make sure you stay with the film to the end... actually, it's INCREDIBLY manipulative, but it's a skill to be respected none the less.<br /><br />I think what hurts the most about poor Ralph here is just how shallow an experience it is.  The product placement is painfully up front; sometimes going so far as to just say the name of whatever they're trying to sell without building context around it.  The early pricks of nostalgia fade pretty quick once you realize that the old characters they've resurrected come from a small handful of games that either Disney is trying to sell or could pick up the license's to cheap.  It's a movie that was ultimately built by the marketing department first and later cleaned up by the art department and it shows.<br /><br />The bottom line is, Wreck-It Ralph is a mediocre kid's flick.  It's engaging and heart-string-tugging enough to keep the little one's entertained, but it lacks the punch and clarity needed to call it a 'for all ages' romp or something that will be remembered for years to come.  Growed-ups will probably be bored for long stretches as the multiple, meandering story-lines finally find their way back together for the surprisingly satisfying conclusion.  And the hipster charm of the opening minutes fades real fast, never to be seen again.  ...Also, if you think about it, the digital characters lead an awful, awful existence - even more depressing than the poor Toy Story toys.  So I seriously encourage you to NOT dwell on the realities the movie suggests and just focus on the fun aspects.  It's... too depressing otherwise.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this series!  Sorry for it to be over.  Waiting for the next movie.<br />I highly recommend reading this series.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The version I gave it 4 stars is cause it was a really good book but to me it was just to short I mean it was 2 hundred and something pages but I just think that with the pictures and stuff it was really about 100 so other than that it was a good book and I would encourage people to get it but just think if it's worth the money but it was a really good and funny book so that's my only objective so you can decide if it's worth it
B005HSL626|5.0|I think this is the BEST game on Amazon!!!! I love it!! My mom<br />Won't stop playing it. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />This is the best game ever!!!!!
B007BVT5N4|4.0|I thought it was going to be different, but I love Justin Bieber so it was good. I'll be reading it again. It did make me feel like I know more about him.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|it is Fantastic! love it, every song is top rate, from the first song to<br />the last one is outstanding.
159420229X|5.0|Very well-written, engrossing tale of a journalist becoming a mental athlete. If you're interested in the brain or just good storytelling, this is a fantastic read.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|This dictionary was really good with a lot of great words.<br />I have chosen this rate, because I can go back and research the words and also I like reading dictionary's. What I dislike about this is that I think that it's just to many words so I just had skipped some pages.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|Laugh out loud funny but somewhat lacking in plot or theme. Reads more like stand up comedy than a novel, so depends on what you're looking for.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I love Vince Flynn and Mitch Rapp character.  The Last Man, story kept you going and the ending was great, can't wait for his next book.
1608871045|5.0|I always love the &#34;behind the scenes&#34; and art books offered from many of the big blockbuster films. However, this book goes way beyond that! The large pictures, and many paper &#34;props&#34; that are included inside this book, make this a real Batman fan's dream! I can only hope that many other film series, like the Hobbit and James Bond can decide to do a book this awesome!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. I could play it all day. It is very addfictive. Down load it you will love this game.
B009O2XY12|1.0|I did enjoy this app.  It was fun to play.  But it did not take long before I ran out of &#34;lives&#34; and they wanted me to buy some more!  Not my idea of free fun!
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I optimistically rented this.  Tommy Lee Jones, Meryl Dearest Streep.  I was bored, that's my excuse for going against the bad reviews.  I kept waiting for the writers to break out of the predictable plot. Alas, alack.  Meryl's character is barely intelligent, Tommy Lee Jones, was not even given that dignity.  Steve is playing the passive therapist. Give them some lines.  But not, if you jump to the vapid ending, you will get the gist, and you will miss nothing in between the first and last scenes.  I would love to see them work with some real material.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Good song, good quality, good music and I love how it links up with all of my amazon mp3 devices!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game reminds me of watching the show. Way more to do in this game than Farmville. The story is cute and the graphics are beautiful.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I love this movie, it is inspirational, funny, charming and definitely worth watching. The movie even captivated my toddlers A good watch for all ages
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would.  It's sort of Glee, but set in the 80's.  The hair and the clothes are fabulous, great trip down memory lane.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I is truly a blessing to have the bible with me as I go about my day.  With so much social pressures, picking up and reading a verse or two is helpful.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Everyone kept telling me, &#34;Watch it, you'll love it.&#34;  Yep.  They were right.  I'm addicted and may have to enter detox when the series ends.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I think that says it all, able to have my email on the go with my kindle or on my phone.
1442359315|5.0|I found this book so compelling that I gave copies of it as Xmas presents.  Was also interesting to hear Dr Alexander discuss the tragedy in Newton.  Check it out on youtube.

1469220482|2.0|Although I liked the book, it was a rip off of Fifty Shades. I will not read the next two books in Sylvia's trilogy because the plot and the people are almost identical. It's as if she did not have an original idea and decided to use E.L. James story line just because it became an instant bestseller.Fifty Shades is so much better and actually has a romantic and fulfilling story line other than sex scenes page after page to where it wasn't even enjoyable anymore and I skipped and skimmed through them.

B0056BMK6K|2.0|I bought this before I heard about the so called 'Locke-gate' where he supposedly gamed the system at Amazon to gain his sales. I won't make judgement on that here. The book itself really didn't tell me anything I haven't read on websites for free.<br />I found him to ramble a lot, keep telling me that he wasn't going to pad the text and toot his own horn while doing exactly that.<br />I felt like I was reading a giant sales pitch for his books and blog.<br />The most disappointing thing that almost made me put the book down before finishing was the blog examples. He keeps saying that he's not manipulating with his blogs but it is SO obvious in his own words about crafting the post and aiming it to get people to react a certain way that he IS manipulating with it. I have doubts after reading things on his site that he honestly believes any of what he writes in his 'human interest' style posts beyond the fact that they will draw people in to buy his books.<br />I think I managed to pull 1 or 2 things from his text so I didn't completely waste my money but I was very disappointed compared to other books on the business that I've read.

B004LWZW7Y|2.0|-------------------------------------------------------------<br />\\"Puss In Boots\\"<br />(Dreamworks, 2012)<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />NOTE: mild spoilers below. and grumpiness.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />My family were big fans of the Puss In Boots character in the Shrek movies, and when we saw the theater ad for this movie, we did little kitty conniptions and could hardly wait for it to come out. We all went together and saw it in the theater and... man, were we disappointed. The script really wasn't up to snuff, with a thin backstory for Puss, lackluster performances overall, and a strained, somewhat mechanistic, clunky plotline. The whole thing felt forced, insincere and uninspired. The Humpty Dumpty character was unpleasant for the sake of unpleasantness, and the \\"twist\\" of his being the bad guy was so predictable I had a dream about it a week before the movie came out. It really was a shame, because the Puss character was originally so vivid and hilarious, but this movie not only failed to live up to its own potential, it actually drained the life out of our enthusiasm for the hero kitt with the big shiny boots. Can't say I'd recommend this one. (Axton)

1439152802|4.0|The Secret Keeper<br />Kate Morton<br /><br />Publisher Summary: During a summer party at the family farm in the English countryside, sixteen-year-old Laurel Nicolson has escaped to her childhood tree house and is happily dreaming of the future. She spies a stranger coming up the long road to the farm and watches as her mother speaks to him. Before the afternoon is over, Laurel will witness a shocking crime. A crime that challenges everything she knows about her family and especially her mother, Dorothy -- her vivacious, loving, nearly perfect mother. Now, fifty years later, Laurel is a successful and well-regarded actress living in London. The family is gathering at Greenacres farm for Dorothy's ninetieth birthday. Realizing that this may be her last chance, Laurel searches for answers to the questions that still haunt her from that long-ago day, answers that can only be found in Dorothy's past. Dorothy's story takes the reader from pre-WWII England through the blitz, to the 60s and beyond. It is the secret history of three strangers from vastly different worlds -- Dorothy, Vivien, and Jimmy -- who meet by chance in wartime London and whose lives are forever entwined. The Secret Keeper explores longings and dreams and the unexpected consequences they sometimes bring. It is an unforgettable story of lovers and friends, deception and passion that is told -- in Morton's signature style -- against a backdrop of events that changed the world.<br /><br />Review: I really enjoyed the characters and the story line. I was drawn in from reading the summary. I worked so many scenarios in my mind while reading and only at the end I figured out the outcome. I loved the going between the two time lines. The reality of war was played out well and the events going on while secondary were very enjoyable. I really liked the current day characters who were siblings and while Gerry was not as involved as Laurel was it was a good sub plot between the siblings. There were times like at the beginning where things were a little confusing like the original conversation between Dorothy and Vivien in Dorothy's room. I also felt that sometimes there was so much information that was a bit overwhelming. Since this is my first, but not last book of Kate Morton's that I will read!!<br />I would like to thank Net Galley and Simon & Schuster for allowing me to read and review this book in return for a free copy and I was never asked to write a favorable review by anyone.the beginning where things were a little confusing like the original conversation between Dorothy and Vivien in Dorothy's room.

B007BFSYMS|2.0|Once again I want to remind people I got this as the free app of the day today from Amazon.COM.<br /><br />This is an app that plays different sounds to wake up to and looks nice.  But I am going to go against the majority of reviewers here and I will explain below why I am giving this only 2 stars.<br /><br />First of all, we all know Mr. Wonderful, AKA Kevin O'Leary from ABC's Shark Tank TV show, would not invest in this because there are no sounds of his favorite thing which is MONEY!!!<br /><br />Also Dolvett Quince, one of the newer trainers from NBC's The Biggest Loser TV show, would also not approve of this app since he has stated that THE NUMBER ONE thing overweight people have in common is that they skip breakfast in the morning.  Since there are no sounds of Bacon or Rice Krispies snap crackle and popping, this app is sorely lacking another important type of sound.<br /><br />But on a more serious type note, there is a major flaw with this app.  Despite the fact you can connect to Facebook and Twitter and can even download more free sounds from the App maker's website, there is no option to upload your own sounds.<br /><br />So for all of the above reasons, I have no choice but to give this one a 2 out of 5 stars.

0743270754|5.0|This is one of those books so thick that they ought to publish it with a set of wheels. That said, it is a fascinating exploration of the character and genius of Abraham Lincoln. Goodwin studies four main characters, Lincoln, plus the other men who were seeking the Republican nomination in the 1860 presidential election, Salmon Chase, William Seward, and Edward Bates. She traces the life of each, from childhood through their tours of duty on Lincoln's cabinet in the dark days of the Civil War.<br /><br />Goodwin does a masterful job of not only displaying (with a great deal of accompanying evidence) the character of each man, but how their political machinations throughout their lives either helped or hurt their political ambitions, ultimately culminating in Lincoln's election. She documents the open disdain with which Lincoln's rivals held the \\"rail splitter from Illinois,\\" and shows how everyone underestimated his intelligence and the shrewdness of his own political maneuverings.<br /><br />Lincoln invites his rivals to serve in his cabinet, placing each man in a position where he can't say \\"no\\" to the opportunity, and then patiently manages the fireworks that ensue from the clash of egos and ambitions at the top level of his administration. At each turn in the story, Goodwin shows how Lincoln outfoxes the newspapers, the politicians, the political parties, and his own cabinet members.<br /><br />The genius of Lincoln, Goodwin demonstrates, is not that he \\"kept his friends close and his enemies closer,\\" but that he managed to turn enemies into allies, calling forth from each man the best of their gifts and skills in the service of a nation badly in need of strong leadership. Lincoln's character (especially his humility) is seen in that many of his most contemptuous rivals became his most devoted friends, once they began to work closely with him. Edwin Stanton's heartbroken tribute at Lincoln's deathbed, \\"Now he belongs to the ages,\\" put a voice to the quiet awe in which many of Lincoln's compatriots held him at the end.<br /><br />This is a terrific book, from multiple aspects. First, I am guessing you won't find a better, more complete accounting of the run-up to the 1860 presidential elections, and then Lincoln's management of his administration. Second, it is an outstanding study of leadership and character. Third, it is a great biography of Lincoln. And last, it is so well-written, so well-documented, so detailed that Goodwin held my attention from the first page to the last. I recommend it highly.which many of Lincoln's compatriots held him at the end.<br /><br />This is a terrific book, from multiple aspects.

0307595579|5.0|I had all the books already but had to get this gorgeous set when it came out. If you only care about the content of the books no need to pay more for these gorgeous hard covers, but if you are like me and want something that looks good on your shelves when you aren't reading it too then definitely get this set. They look great and are well made. Oh, and the story is fantastic. It starts slow in book 1 but by half way through the first book and into books 2 and 3 I raced through. Highly recommend

B0018C2W8C|5.0|This was the start of the remastered Who albums of the 1990s. After trolling the record stores for whatever bootlegs were out there, it was nice to have something (sorta) new from my favorite band. Four discs for me to obsess over. Awesome!<br /><br />Some rarities are missing from here though that were available elsewhere, like the clearer version of &#34;Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde&#34; (or any version of that!), or &#34;Sodding About,&#34; which only became available with the Deluxe Edition of The Who Sell Out. And what about the Fillmore East 1968 gig?<br /><br />In any case, this was the start of an uneven adventure with remastering The Who's catalog, where some things suffered under Jon Astley's ministrations (Face Dances worst of all), and some became even more fabulous (The Who Sell Out). But for a brief shining moment, there was hope that the old band and its fans would get the treatment they deserved.<br /><br />If you are a casual Who fan, this is a fairly good starting point. A good collection of well-known and rare bits. A fan might have all this in various locations, and probably has the box set lying somewhere. For me, this is an essential collection to have on hand.

B005UDD1R6|3.0|I believe my Vista player needed an adapter plug in from this app and so I downloaded it, since I'm happy with my Vista player I suppose this was worth it as well.
1582701709|5.0|What can I say? I just love this book. It helped me turn my life around. If you allow it to, it can do the same for you.  Don't get me wrong, you do NOT have to buy this book. It does not &#34;guarantee&#34; to bring you perfect happiness in your life just by simply reading it. The Secret is really about the power of positive thinking, and it was remarkably helpful and beneficial to me. This book is a tool to help you understand the law of attraction, put it to good use, and feel better about your world. I have a special place for this book on my bedside table. I would recommend this book to anyone who was interested in it. And just to let everyone know, this book is not &#34;religious&#34;, as in, there is no reason for it to be found offensive to anyone's spiritual beliefs, because it is just so genuinely beneficial, without trying to judge anyone or anything as right or wrong. I hope everyone that reads this book finds it enjoyable and helpful
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I'm not sure what happened but it never downloaded correctly.  this was the first alarm clock I tried, and it just wouldn't work...kept on saying missing files and tried to uninstall and reinstall but nothing.  so I gave up on it.
0525457585|5.0|I grew up watching the movie and the second movie of this book. The first movie was good, the second movie was ok, and well... the &#34;third&#34; movie... yeah, let's not even go there, because it has absolutely nothing to do with the book... Let's just pretend that movie doesn't exist. Anyways, I am happy to say that truly, this book is one of my favorite reads from my young adulthood. It is better than the first movie, and it goes far beyond the plot of the second movie. I feel this book has some valuable lessons, and is so imaginative that, even though I have not read it in quite a while, the fantastic realm of this book haunts me. I will definitely read it to my kids someday.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|I have seen the movie plenty of times, lend it to family members and co-workers.  Funny and charming and a bit nutty...come on it is family guy at his best.

032147404X|5.0|Great tips and very funny to read, there are parts that makes you laugh and they are still very informative and usefull. The book is easy to follow, highly recommended.

B002SR2PKG|4.0|I am a fan of most Stephen King books, and I would say this is a good one for someone interested in psychological horror mixed with a coming of age kind of feel. I liked the characters instantly and enjoyed the overall flow of the story. Got a little bored during some of the history sections, but not so bored to put the book down. Definitely one that makes you stop and think, even long after you've finished reading it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|i play this on my long commute to work, love the story line and it wakes me up when i'm about to start work.
1594487154|3.0|I love a good nonfiction read. I didn't find it here. The author goes on and on with statistics and studies and fails to tell much of a \\"story\\" in between. I think he should have paid much more attention to \\"persuasion\\" than to \\"selling\\". In spite of the author's assertion that pretty much all of us are now \\"non-sales sellers\\" in the new economy, I have a very hard time seeing myself or those I work with that way. We do work hard to communicate ideas and persuade each other about the value of one approach or another, but how is this \\"selling\\" any more than it would have been in life or business 50 years ago. The book's new fangled selling mantra just didn't work for me.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|i wish i was better at tapping but the truth is this game is just not for my skill level.  I like the graphics and the way it feels but I just can't tap fast enough in order to steer.  so this game is just not for me.  probably a 5yr old can play this way better than I so I think the game is okay
B005LAIHQS|4.0|We thought this was a very creative story line and well done by all involved.  Thoroughly enjoyed this, as did our teenage daughters.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love this game, great game so basic but so much fun.  I love the speed and very easy to learn to play.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|it is what i wanted, easy to use and highly affective.  What is there not to love about it. does its job.
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|Having been a Tim Burton fan since the 80's, I'm always curious to see what he's got up his sleeve when he releases a new film.  Though, lately I haven't been too impressed with his work and this movie is no exception.  Honestly, I wasn't the audience for this film, so I shouldn't be judging this film too harshly.  I'm just saying that was more or less indifferent about it.<br /><br />One of the things that I really enjoyed about the film was the fact that Tim Burton allowed himself to showcase his absurd, but awesome, character design.  I don't think I've seen Tim Burton do this type of character design since Beetlejuice--which I think he needs to do more of.
B007BT0RKG|3.0|it looks like it will work great but until i take it to a region i haven't been to and really test it, i will never know.  great idea though and it downloads maps fine so heres hoping it works great.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|I read this book back in high school for a book report and was pleasantly surprised.  By the time I got to the last page, I had officially found my favorite book.  Unfortunately, I have not re-read it since then, but I do remember it fondly and purchased the book on the Kindle to allow me to revisit it now.  This is probably one of the best pieces of science fiction I have ever read.  Though because of its slower pace, this might not be for everyone.  Some people may dislike it because of that, and I understand that.  But that won't stop me from recommending it to anyone and everyone that I know that enjoys reading.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B006KX3GXO|3.0|I am not entirely sure if this is the app I use with my pictures, however after downloading this and Photo Editor (unfortunately at the same time) my pictures look way better.  so it is what it is.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This was a very good movie. I had my doubts,I am a fan of the original series. I hesitated a couple of months before watching this movie. To my surprise,this was a very dark movie,with some comical content,but mostly dark. Johnny Depp did a fantastic job,acting as Barrnabis Collins. Overall I would watch this agan,and again.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn 't put down the first book and am finding it equally difficult to set down the second in the series. I could become quite a couch potato with these
B005DD7H50|5.0|I did not expect the movie to be as good as it was! I am highly recommending it to my family and friends.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|What a pleasant surprise. I only ordered this CD because it was recommended related to my other musical choices. I'm so glad I took a chance! It's on permanent rotation right now. That voice! Beautiful, great rang, and spirited. And the songs are very different from a lot of the R&B out there. In fact, I'm not sure I would say this is straight up R&B. There's a folk/blues quality to some of the tracks, but not all. Some of the songs are just as catchy and soulful as any Mary J. Blige song (old Mary of course). At any rate, it feels great to be able to listen to a CD from start to finish again. It's hard to find these days. I'll definitely be buying more of Emile's music in the future.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Third story of the Fifty Shades trilogy. It is more of the same of the other two - continues the story of Ana and Christian. Not particularly well written as there are gaps in the story. Unanswered questions, etc. Easy read for a rainy afternoon.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|It kept it's secret right to the very end and the twist was stunning. I loved it. I expected nothing less from this author who I've enjoyed through all her novels.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Have greatly enjoyed each session, the events all tied together, the representation of the period in time, and all the characters... Well worth the time viewing this Season 2... Have also gotten and viewed Season 1, just as good.
B002C949AE|3.0|Hard to belive unless you have lived in Africa.  I think a lot was left out, she became famous too quick.  But all in all it was a good story.
1400067820|5.0|This is a great book even if finance and economics don't interest you as many of the concepts he describes can be applied to life in general.  The main idea is this:  avoid situations (investments) with unlimited downside and small upside, seek out situations (investments) with limited, small downside and unlimited upside.  If you like his other books, you'll like this one.  If you like his epistemology, you might find Frederick Hayek and Thomas Sowell interesting.
B007JGAR6U|3.0|Okay, of all of the products associated with my Fuji X-Pro 1 system, this is the one I like the least.  I don't think there are very many options out there (if you want to stay with a Fuji flash) so I went with the EF-X20.  The flash uses 2 AAA batteries.  Well, you better carry a pocket full because it eats them up like crazy.  I also find that the &#34;on-off&#34; is not as positive as I would like.  I would prefer a toggle switch rather than the push button so I KNOW it is on rather than THINKING it is on.  This has caught me a few times.<br /><br />As far as the flash is concerned, it works perfectly with the camera settings (manual or automatic).  Balance is great and the design lends to the classic camera design.  I have not really put it through some difficult shooting situations (I sometimes need to shoot in very dark engine compartments covered in soot) but for normal shooting and as a fill flash, it is great.<br /><br />I will be searching for battery options and/or figuring out why it blows through the AAA's so fast (perhaps it is something I am doing - but I don't think so) but in the meantime, it stays on the camera most of the time.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I remember when Disney had an interactive train going around the country advertising for this movie.  I took my niece and nephews and we had a great time on the trian.  We forgot, however to go see the movie when it came out.  I finally remember to purchase the DVD this past holiday season.  I'm SO glad I did.  It's an excellent movie!  Very engaging, serious and funny, and brings home the message of keeping and sharing the spirit of Christmas all year.  This is a must-see every Christmas.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was amazing<br />Kept my full attention.  Couldn't put it down.  Amazing author.  Made me a believer.  Sorry it's over.  Thanks.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I enjoyed watching each Harry Potter movie when they originally came out.  I stopped short of viewing part two of the last movie back then because I just never purchased it.  Buying this complete collection and viewing all of the movies in sequence, made for an exciting, anticipatroy climax when viewing &#34;The Deathly Hallows Part Two&#34;.  I had a Harry Potter movie marathon, and had a ball!  It is well worth the price.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Here in north Texas, we say &#34;if you don't like the weather, wait a minute.&#34; With this app, I can check the hourly forecast, look at a local radar map, or get weather alerts at any time.
B00838HRP2|5.0|Actually, I haven't viewed it yet.  I only watch PINOCCHIO on new years eve, but I expect the dvd to be perfect....if not, tune in in 2014
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Excellent book, keeps you captivated and wanting to read on.  You must read &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; the first novel in this series to truly appreciate this novel.
B00846REIS|4.0|I have read the 50 shades series & was looking for something similar. This book has me hooked on Sylvia Day!! Can't wait to read the next book in the crossover series. Suspenseful,raunchy &captivating. Loved it.
1742200206|4.0|No Staten Island at all, and barely a mention of Brooklyn or Queens. But, on the other hand, isn't Manhattan where most tourists are headed?<br /><br />Coverage of Manhattan then. Pretty good overall, with lots on the top museums and Central Park, a clear notion of NYC as one of the culinary capitals of the world, good Broadway (and Off-Broadway) coverage, and a good sense of NYC neighborhood history. It's probably darned close to the right topics for the first time visitor to the big apple, so for those folks, do ignore the hometown boys and girls upset at the missing outer Burroughs and the greatest hits being discussed rather than the hidden gems.
B00866H7SS|3.0|It was an OK read and I would read any follow up books but I expected a better story line which is a bit ' wishy-washy' and there are too many similarities to the series 'Shades of Gray' - could be the same writer ?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series; both for the depiction of early 1900s to the story lines intertwined with actual occurring events at that time.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I can not download it and it really is making me mad. j have heard good things about it and I wanna try it...
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was fun to follow up with Katnis and Peta. I couldnt wait to see what was going to happen next.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I really enjoy mysteries, but this one added historical references that increased it interest.  I felt as though I was back in those times enjoying the ways of the well-to-do in that society.
B009MO5960|4.0|I don't know why I like this series so much, but I do.  There, I said it.  Resident Evil movies are just FUN FUN FUN!  And kind of gross, but what do you expect with all the zombies?<br /><br />This is not my favorite entry into the series.  It was a little choppy, though I did get a kick out of seeing Carlos and Rain and Jill again.  Even though Carlos and Rain weren't exactly Carlos and Rain.  This movie actually seemed more like a video game than the others, but I liked it anyway.  And I'm glad they set it up for another sequel.<br /><br />I admit I haven't played much of the video games - I kept getting stuck at the beginning because I'm not a 12 year old boy.  But the movies are fun.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Ths app is cool. Just type n what u want n it's saved 4 u. Even lock<br />a note if u want. Nice
B001MV49HG|5.0|Misplaced my old copy so had to buy a new one. Purchased during the holiday and received it on Christmas eve.
B0085OEU1I|5.0|Music is great and fun to sing along with! LOVE IT! The story line is complete and Johnny depp!!! Enough said!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is an awesome game ive had a lot of fun playing this and its so additive. best game ever
B008K8X0IS|5.0|Loved it! If you like the Tolkien stories you will feel right at home with this saga. I can't wait to buy season two!
B004LWZW88|4.0|Bought for nephew for his birthday.  Have all of the Shrek movies and this one completed the collection.  Quality wonderful and movie great for all ages.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|Very interesting and with a little different twist.  The characters were believable and the story line kept me intrigued.  I'd recommend this book to everyone.
1455508977|5.0|This is such a sweet film, at first glance, I thought it would be sappy. After a few minutes it was apparent that the movie was going to be great. I thoroughly enjoyed it and so did my husband.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is not only about going left or right, jumping or sliding. Now there are ropes, hills, caves and one giant monkey! If you liked the first, you'll love this one.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book kept me guessing on where their relationship was heading.  Great suspense & drama with what becomes the ultimate sacrifice made by Gideon for their relationship.  Excited to see what comes with the final book.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Procesador bastante rápido y rendidor, sobretodo en juegos y en renderización de videos. puede llegar a 3650MHz de frecuencia de manera automática cuando se requiera.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I honestly think Rod Stewart's voice just gets better and better !! I love this CD. I hear he has a new CD coming out soon, can't wait to get it.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a fantastically created story of a love that is everlasting and enduring despite the illness of the wife.  It shows true devotion and love in a relationship.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I like most of the songs, which is rare for any music CD. She has lyrics printed also.  My recommendation.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|A true CLASSIC...terminator 2, skynet edition  blu-ray is great..beautiful picture and the extra features with an extended version is worth it! buy!
B007JRUCGO|2.0|All I can say it that lots and lots of repitition. Weak story line and did not hold my interst or my granddaughter's.
B004OBQDHK|5.0|If you are looking to buy this, then you dont need another reason,its POINT BREAK!..and it's blu-ray..there you got one! BODISAFA! one of the best movies ever!
B003O86FMW|4.0|The girl turning to woman amidst primal violence. The twists the turns the true love.  Great ending. I am getting the final book right away.
B002ZG9846|5.0|THIS is a very funny movie and looks terrific in blu-ray...if you  can use the 3 disc combo, which includes blu-ray,dvd combo and a digital copy then you are in luck!
B000000XB8|5.0|Only song that is missing that I would have really like to see is 'Midnight Special.' Besides that flawless album from a superb group. Really wished more type of this classic swamp rock was prevalent today.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Prometheus lovers unite...if you thought the theater's imax 3d  was good...this will blow it out of the water....if you own a samsung 3d tv and a blu ray surround system combo then it is a must have! you won't regret it!
6305428271|1.0|The move was scratched and had a piece on the end bent so it only played for about 30min then stopped. I expected better it said the movie was in good condition on the description .
B000MRAAJM|5.0|AMAZING picture and scenes..if you love the planet and its' wildlife then you will love this blu-ray ...it is breath taking.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This season is a little different...but nevertheless addicting.  My husband and I blew through it in no time! Some of the characters change a bit and there are a few new and surprising scenarios.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Contact is a great movie...jodie foster is great, and the movie quality is crystal clear, i highly recommend this to anyone that has not seen this overlooked sci fi film.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like having an alarm that doesn't sound annoying. This is it. Many choices. A bit expensive, but it works nicely. If you need an alarm that you pay for, grab this one.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|i just don't see what has attracted so many people to this book. it is low octane porn with a fairly unbelievable story line. i will not read the other books in this series.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think a lot of people should read this book. It shows you what it's like to be like Auggie. I love the book because it really touched me. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is awesome. You can be different characters and you rank up so you can go to different arenas and get different weapons/armor. I recommend this game very highly and it's FREE.
1401937268|5.0|They're tarot cards, but they have a few cards with different words. Good for the beginner because the cards have interpretations on them as well.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Great app.  Very complicated and challenging. You are able to draw the things you need to solve the puzzles to get through the levels.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is having troubles in high school and life in general. It's a wonderful read. I couldn't put it down.
B005CMGKTG|5.0|Just wish it was also dubbed in english. I hate reading movies. . . . . . . . .
0688101364|4.0|I also used the royal icing recipe and made a bizillion cookies for Christmas presents.  The recipe worked fine.  I'm not quite sure why there was so much space used for the gingerbread cathedral, but, well, if I ever want to make a gingerbread cathedral, I'm all set!  I appreciate that all recipes use weights as well as volume, since I've shifted over to weighing when I bake--it was really useful when I needed to figure out how much of my big bowl of egg whites to use in the royal icing.  One note--she frequently references a particular website for supplies that is no longer in business (I forget now which one) but if you look for that site on Google it will take you to the new company that sells the same stuff.
0446572993|5.0|Lots of action and great content. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
B00A757EFW|4.0|Fun, and nostalgic. Challenging, yet fun and addictive, just like the original game. I would reccommend this game to anyone that liked playing the original, or new gamers to try.
B000088E6D|5.0|MR. BUBLE HAS A WARM AND WONDERFUL VOICE AND TERRIFIC TO LISTEN TO HIS PHRASING OF SOME OF THESE OLD STANDARDS.  AMAZING THAT HE'S SO YOUNG AND XPECT GREAT THINGS FROM HIM IN THE FUTURE.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I don't remember reading anywhere that this was a YA fiction, so i was surprised when i realised it was written for people much younger than myself , but nevertheless  it was a fairly enjoyable read.  Some heavy subject matter mixed with first love. I read it in a day so it couldn't have been too bad. I wouldn't let my 13 year old read it due to the heavy nature of some of the story line but would ok for 15 years plus I think.
B003M7BLOW|5.0|Ordered this cpu as an upgrade to replace a 2 core Athlon.  Came with heatsink, fan and thermal paste.  All I had to do was take the old one out and place this one in:  a 5 minute job.  Can't beat the price.  I will try overclocking it a little.  I'll reccommend it to anyone with a AM3 socket motherboard.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|This USB Interface is great, really no noise, silent dead, great for vocal recording<br />It's Light, Really portable, do your Interfaces review before buying one, that' what I did<br />you'll end up getting this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is by far the best book I've read in a long time. It was tough to read at times, but only because of the story line. I laughed and cried like a baby.
B009CPRYG2|4.0|This is a great adaption/movie/cartoon etc, I have collected every DC movie released thus far and in Bluray, so I really appreciate the better picture and sound quality. What I would like to see is a full on higher quality of animation in a full length movie,  you know, more drawings per second, this two part release could have been a cinematic release, tell me how many fans would have been queuing up for that, Disney quality animation would be just outstanding on the Dark Knight, imagine full digital muscular movement on the torso of Bats, the best animated looking bat mobile would have to be The Batman version. Maybe some new blood in your creative department, don't get me wrong, I love everything that has been done, you don't think that batman would be good enough? I certainly do not mean toy story style or green lantern animated, just more frames per second. Keep up the good work regardless, but that is something I would like to see, I didn't buy blu ray and a hi def tv for nothing.
0920668372|2.0|I find this book a tad bit freakish. Yes it starts out sweet but when your kid is a teen, adult, old man coming home to sit in your lap and nuzzle up - it's kind of freaky weird. It's toooooo involved between mom and son. And the kid does some rotten things. Plus it puts it in a kids face way to early that your mom is going to up and die one day. I may be the only  mom (definately the only one i know) that hates this book. My kids don't like it either. The artwork isn't interesting and the lyrics not so rhythmic. The four copies we were given as gifts I sent right to the resale book store after trying for weeks to like this book.
030759565X|5.0|I've been hitting up the Smitten Kitchen website for years, and with one failure that was my own fault every single thing has turned out perfectly. PERFECTLY. When I heard about the actual real print cookbook I got very excited, and was super stoked to get it for Bozic.<br /><br />The cookbook is better than I expected.<br /><br />The recipes are clear and concise, very easy to understand and follow. They're also all painstakingly tested which is fabulous and sets this cookbook apart from some \\"professional\\" cookbooks I have which omit ingredients and steps, have typos, etc. Each recipe is preceded by an entertaining short story full of wit and personality, and accompanied by one or more stunning photos.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in making or even just eating food. Perelman loves food, loves feeding and eating, and her delight really shines through. This is hands down one of the best cookbooks I've read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a awesome game, I want my own horse but we don't have any room in my back yard so I play this game and it is kinda simalar.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Enjoyed the story. Well written and was an enjoyable love story. Related to all characters who seemed real. Great read.
B0099114WO|3.0|We really like both of these actors and expected more than what we saw. We still like them not too great in this endeavor!
B00013RC8O|5.0|sorry ment to say the piece of music in the movie isnt on the sound track,this being the only<br />reason for buyiny the sound track.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|Not up to my expectations when compared to Matt Damon's Jason Bourne!so so, so., so so so so so so so
B000W2742I|5.0|I adore this c.d. this band is very unique and inventive, A great c.d. to veg out to, relax, atmospheric, jazz, blues, voice that is heaven, best c.d. please buy
B007BZM3HK|5.0|AMAZING song, THE BIGGEST SONG CRAZY IN A WHILE. Who has not done this song?  everyone is singing it worldwide
B0030MM68O|4.0|This movie fascinated me. I come from an Army background and was married to a Marine so I'm familiar with the adrenaline addiction that life in a war zone produces in some people. At home the main character is just one more bored, restless young man with few future prospects. As an Army bomb disposal expert in Iraq he can play cowboy every day, challenging the odds in deadly circumstances and riding the rush each time he walks away unharmed. High-ranking officers praise him publicly and other soldiers either fear him or are in awe of him. The greater the thrills, the greater the craving for them.<br /><br />I have no idea whether the conditions in Iraq are portrayed accurately here, so if you're looking for documentary realism don't watch this movie. If you want a study of, as the quote in the opening says, &#34;war as a drug,&#34; this movie is superb. Plus, Jeremy Renner nails the leading role cold.
B008SVFX96|5.0|I'm a big Bon Jovi fan and I've always loved Richie Sambora's solo work.  There are several really good songs on this CD.  I got a preview of Richie's new CD on the Craig Ferguson Show.  I love this CD.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought that temple run 2 will cost money. But again temple run is free. This Tim  you are getting chased by a huge monkey. You get like twice as many coins. The game takes a while to download. So get it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I can't wait to play Kung fu Scrat every day. Great game alone or with friends and fun for my 8 yr old too.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a wonderful game for people who like horses. I think its a good and fun way to take care of a horse
B006LSZECO|3.0|I have read all of Gillian Flynn's books. All of which had great dialogue and character development with a twist you would never expect. This book was a great read up until the end. I feel as if the ending was rushed and thrown together without much thought. I guess I was just expecting a more dramatic macabre ending then what I got....
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I am a huge Sandra Bullock and Betty White fan.  Teaming them together in this movie was genious.  Sandra gets better with age in her acting and Betty has always been wonderful.  This movie will make you laugh and make you cry and make you tell your friends to see it if they never have.
B00111YM5G|4.0|it was a low budget movie but it was good  but not great.  different from all  the archangel movie i have seen.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Honestly the first half of the book is VERY confusing!  Lots of characters with odd/foreign names to remember.  There is even a family tree in the beginning of the book because it's so crazy.  After about half way...book got GREAT!
B00005JMFQ|1.0|The seller of this movie did not deliver on-time despite being paid for - and when package arrived late, it was missing the return address so that I could receive a refund. What a disappointment!
B0034JKZ3G|2.0|This is by far the most disappointing Disney movie I have seen. The animation, story and acting all lack creativity, polish and originality. My wife and I are big fans of animation and this was a big disappointment for us both. It felt much like a direct to DVD sequel of another movie but it wasn't. Disney had actually released this in theaters but it had a very short run. The film is available on NetFlix now and is hardly worth the time. The drawing in the animation felt rushed and unfinished. The story was a mixture of something classic with a modern twist but very poorly executed. It might pass for the youngest of minds but even then, it's a bit to frightening for young children, and for older kids it's certainly not the best of the bunch.
B0060CXSR4|4.0|Okay, so I got the instant video version of this movie.  That is good for the main reason of not having to replace it, because the movie will always be in your video library (unless something should happen like Amazon going out of business or something, but I don't anticipate that to happen anytime soon).  You don't have to worry about the disc getting scratched, or worried about it getting lost or whatever.  The bad thing about streaming movies is that you only get the movie with no options.  I can't get subtitles, and there's none of the extra stuff that you get when you buy the disc.  All you get with streaming is the movie itself, which I suppose is fine, but not if you're interested in the extra bonus materials.  I gave it four stars for the movie itself, but took off a point because Amazon should be able to put the full content options that the DVD/BluRay has.  It is 2013 you know!  I'm sure they could.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great cast of characters. Great actors. Great storyline. Beautiful cinematography. Very engaging and keeps you interested. I enjoyed every minute of it.
B0006GQMC8|5.0|Bought this for a friend as a christmas present. fast delivery.  Some things you just can&#34;t buy at the store. thank you
B00687PWQG|4.0|Good production, acting, musical score.  Interesting how little regard there was for an ex-President.  Recommend for all American history buffs.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Another one of Colleen's books that I just could not put down. Great dialogue and story line. Can't wait to read the sequel.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was a good read...slow start, but kept my interest once it began to take off. I would definitely recommend to friends.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is finally here. It's been on iOS for about a week or a little over. Now it's finally here on Android. The long anticipated game is very fun and much better then the first. I like the theme much better then its predecessor. It looks like one of the Air Temples from Avatar: The Last Airbender. The game doesn't lag and I haven't found any glitches so far. Keep in mine I am playing this on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Graphics and design are amazing. I highly recommend this game. Especially if you liked the 1st or Brave. I own all 3 and I like them all. Thanks for reading and I hope this helped you decide if you wat to get it or not. What do you have to lose by just trying it. It's FREE :-).
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I absolutely loved this DVD!! it is great buy especially for its price. it was almost like we were in the movie theather, the picture quality and sound was amazing.
B00AQK4EWY|5.0|My interest in the novel was sparked by the stage play and the recent film. Of course, the book is much more detailed than the play but one can easily skip over the lists of charities the bishop donates to and so forth. The French is quite accessible. Recommended for anyone who reads French and wants a glimpse of the real 19th-century France. Hugo was a stickler for detail.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Interesting, entertaining and nonstop action.  No Easy Day was factual and still very interesting with out revealing too much information.  Well written and easy to follow, kept you interested  through out the whole book.  Best i have read on the Bin Ladden subject.
0689835604|5.0|This book was good for my son with big flaps and body parts to review. The only thing that would be better, would be more pages!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Once again Tom Clancy hits one out of the park.  Realistic drama with non stop action, you can actually beleive  this could happen or that it already has.  The many plots are a little confusing at first but they all come together in the end.  Another thriller that keeps you anxiously waiting for the next one.  Great Read!!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Read before, because I read the Percy Jackson series. Very detailed, almost like being in the world of Percy Jackson and Jason Grace.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it's an intresting game and I have all most all thhe people and i have so so so much fun playing it
B00914JWSW|5.0|I have most of her albums and have always enjoyed her range and style.  She is truly remarkable even at her age now.  Her voice has lost very little and she is a great show person.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|the  pets are cute and fun to play with and I now have so much pets and money and houses
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its so fun all the quests u have2 do its awesome!!!!!!!!!!! all I want 2 do is play play play!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1451696191|5.0|Really enjoyed the book. I could relate to it in ways that no other book has accomplished before. A must read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have Safe Haven a five star because it was great warming and made me think about how my first true love will turn out. How he went back and forth between what Katie and Kevin were doing made the book more interesting than it already was. I just think that everyone should give this book a chance, even if you don't like romances. It's not just about romance but you always got some good thrill and crazy ex husband/ boyfriend's.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Enjoyable book to read with lots of interesting facts. If you like military fiction then this book is for you.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|It works well and fits my black Maglite prefectly! Excellent product and value for money. No more worry on burn out blub anymore! I think this is a good deal.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book it has a lot of action and anybody who likes Greek mythology is going to love this book I wish that people will read the rest of the series as well
B003VANOFY|1.0|This headset has amazing audio quality. Sadly, it only works about 10% of the time, the rest being so garbled its unintelligible, and/or losing its signal every (what seems like) five minutes. Absolute s***.
B009TSA6YE|4.0|Seriously....I'm so taken by this DVD that I can't even describe it other than.. \\"Whoa!\\"<br /><br />This is probably one of the most (if not THE MOST) incredible concert dvd's I've ever heard/seen. I'll slightly digress by making a sports analogy so please accept my advanced apology if you are not a sports fan.....<br /><br />Another Michael, \\"Jordan\\" that is, was probably the greatest basketball player that ever lived. On a typical night for him he'd score between 25-30 points in a game. On those rare nights when he was really \\"ON,\\" you'd see him drop 50 points or more!<br /><br />Musicians,like sports heroes, can be much the same. Michael Schenker, one of the planet's greatest guitar players, sounds better than most people on any given night. He has a multitude of live recordings to enjoy and you'll hear him on any number of his live recordings \\"wow\\" you with his talent. On those very rare nights, he will go \\"otherworldly\\" on you, much like Michael Jordan could do when he was in the zone! There haven't been many of those live recorded moments of Michael Schenker's when he was captured on a truly \\"ON\\" night. \\"Strangers in the Night\\" by UFO may be one of them (though it was actually recorded over a couple of different nights in 1978) and maybe his performance on \\"One Night at Budokan.\\" I truly think that on this DVD, all cylinders are firing and it may very well be the greatest \\"on\\" moment of Michael's ever recorded!<br /><br />The sound quality is phenomenal and the producer/director does a decent job of actually showing Michael Schenker when he's soloing ( I hate it when they pan to other band members during a musician's solo on most concert dvd's). The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because Doogie White trashes many of the lyrics. He sounds great and it really doesn't affect the songs, but really, \\"dude,\\" learn the words! Most of these tunes are some of the greatest guitar tunes in rock music history; can't you get the words right?<br /><br />It's nice to see Hermann Rarebell and Francis Buccholz on stage together again. I always thought they were an under-rated rhythm section when they played with Scorpions during the heyday of metal.<br /><br />Another great thing about this recording is that Michael takes a fair amount of liberties with some of his traditional songs. He adds some more fills and/or rearranges a few of his classics and the changes really add to the songs. Wayne Findley is also fantastic on this DVD and tears up the solos in \\"Rock You Like A Hurrican.\\"<br /><br />If you like Michael Schenker or simply enjoy hard rock played with a great deal of emotion and technique, get this DVD. It's \\"Michael\\" scoring over 50 points!s nice to see Hermann Rarebell and Francis Buccholz on stage together again.

B004RZGUBM|3.0|There's no point in critiquing Dickens in this forum. I love his work, but am dismayed that the level of proofreading found in ebooks in the public domain is so universally low. This edition is no exception, in spite of the fact that it is not free. It's been spellchecked, but there's some little mistake or other on nearly every page I've read so far. Will press on nonetheless for the sake of having all this material available on a portable gadget.
B008YP272M|5.0|I first read Christopher Hitchens' writing in Vanity Fair when I was visiting USA in 2010. I was immediately struck by not only his immaculate use of the English language, but his wit. I actually subscribed to VF from Australia in order to continue to read his contributions, not least those concerning his battle with cancer. I found that he was able to personalise a faceless disease, make human the effects of the treatment which sound so non- specific in textbooks. His ability to describe the feelings I see in my own patients has been wonderful - I would show them his pages and they would smile and nod agreement. Thank you, Mr Hitchens, for engaging me and so many others.

0345525558|5.0|I can tell you with no hesitation, that Victoria Jones will break your heart like shattered glass. Being abandoned from birth and shifted from one foster home to the next has left Victoria angry and mistrusting, not only of others, but of herself as well. Ms. Diffenbaugh  has described Victoria's feelings so well, that Victoria's rage drips from every page and you'll feel her turmoil in the pit of your stomach. She feels unworthy and incredibly flawed. At the age of eight, she is placed with sad and lonely Elizabeth who, after a trial and error period, finds she loves Victoria deeply and wants to adopt her and formally make the child her daughter. Victoria, as happy as she is about the upcoming court date, has reservations. She can't understand why anyone would want her, let alone love her. It is through Elizabeth's patience, caring and teachings of the messages that flowers convey as well as how the massive vineyard runs, that Victoria feels she finally belongs somewhere. Sadly, Elizabeth's own memories of a love lost and her sister's betrayal stalk her day and night. When Victoria starts feeling threatened by Elizabeth's repeated attempts at reconciliation with her sister, Catherine, with dreams of being one, big, happy family once more, she tests the boundaries of their relationship until a foolish, adolescent plot ruins it all. Many years of sorrow and regrets haunt Victoria. Finally, she turns 18 and is emancipated from the foster care system. But, where will she go? She has no one to turn to except her caseworker, Meredith, who suggests she look for a job right away--but how? She hasn't got a high school diploma, who would hire her? With no money for an apartment, she decides to live in the park among the flowers where she feels comfortable and safe. She becomes acquainted with Renata, who owns \\"Bloom\\", a local flower shop. Victoria's talents with flower selection and arranging amaze Renata and she takes her under her wing--helping her to find a place to livewith her sister. It is through one of the purchasing trips to the flower market that she meets (after 10 years) Elizabeth's nephew and Catherine's son, Grant. They shyly and carefully become friends and more--all through \\"The Language of Flowers\\". Ms. Diffenbaugh's work is outstanding. She has written a poignant tale of love lost and found, heartbreak plus a look into the often times sad workings of the foster care system, of which she has knowledge and has included a small floral language dictionary for readers to peruse. The Author has also helped to launch \\"The Camellia Network\\" (Camellia means \\"My Destiny is in Your Hands\\") with its mission being to activate community minded citizens and encourage them to give the critical support young people need in their transition from foster care to responsible adulthood.

159420411X|5.0|Read this book because of the review on the Daily Show.  Was thoroughly entranced by Silver's brilliance and his eerily accurate predictions.

0307454568|5.0|Having read Larsson's first two books, this was a must-read. Start with the first one and don't stop. Trust me...
B004LWZWGK|5.0|First off, I have to admit that I'm a big fan of this story line, and I've been one from the beginning.  It is a respectful conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy, and wraps things up neatly, but it is less than satisfying for us old-school comic geeks.<br /><br />If you have not seen this film, stop reading now because I'm about to reveal some spoilers.<br /><br />You've been warned.<br /><br />If you still want to read on, let's continue.<br /><br />Bane's character is almost unrecognizable compared to his comic-book character, and it's hard to believe that Alfred would ever desert his charge under any circumstances, but it helps the story to highlight that doing the right thing is always important, even if no one is watching, and even if those whose opinions are important to you disapprove of what you are doing.<br /><br />All (or at least most) of us old-school comic geeks also disapprove of Bruce Wayne's &#34;retirement&#34; of his alter-ego at the end, seemingly to never return.  Much the same as Alfred's abandonment of his duty, it's hard to believe that Bruce would ever abandon Gotham, especially since it's cost him everything, literally.  One would think that his celebrity and some diligent effort would reveal the fraud that stripped him of his fortune and restore it to him so he could continue to be the night watchman of Gotham.<br /><br />I won't comment on the Robin thing, except to say that it shouldn't have been included in this film.<br /><br />All in all, I consider this trilogy more of an &#34;alternate universe&#34; Batman story, and that the Bat we've known and loved all these years is still watching over Gotham and the entire world as part of the Justice League.<br /><br />I will conclude by saying that the Christopher Nolan trilogy still beats any Batman movie or series ever made, and Christian Bale is a better Bat than Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney and Adam West.
0345505387|4.0|I understood the publiscist wanted a different story here but it turned out to follow the Outlander storyline again.  Also, there were too many noticeable errors . . . Jamie's shoulder wound being on the right side in some places and on the left in others.  Beautiful artwork though.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Finally!  A superhero movie that's an unapologetic reproduction of the story you would see in a real comic book!  All the same cheesy dialogue and witty one-liners we would see in a comic overlaid above a surprisingly well-written and intelligent story on a very large scale.  This is what you may have missed if you aren't into comics, or set them aside with your youth.<br /><br />There is nothing anyone could say is bad about this movie.  It is well done in every way, superbly acted, visually stunning and a lot of good old-fashioned fun.  The sets are highly detailed, the visual effects are outstanding and the story moves without pause to a climax that you would not see coming if you haven't already heard about it.<br /><br />Lots of action, lots of laughs, lots of awesome visuals, lots of fun for the young and young-at-heart.  Must-see.
044022425X|5.0|Again, terrific writing with very deep meaning to some of the stories.  I didn't particularily like being drug through the story about the attempted abortion of a slave woman under very dire circumstances.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Dredd fans should take the time to sit and watch this movie. I was very please with the fit and feel of the movie to what I had read in books.
B006VJMZXY|3.0|Overall I enjoyed the story and the characters in it. The concept of the story and the gaining of insight into how the lives of the nobles was manipulated and programmed to be very good but the flow of the story to me was disjointed.  I found the story to have a very slow beginning.  I understand there is a need to be introduced to the characters and their environment but taking this into account it could have progresses quicker.  The manner in which the story jumped from one castle to the next at each chapter was to me breaking the continuity of the story and a little harder to follow the charaters and their environments.
B00355L2TU|5.0|i am 3 days into this series, and so far am enjoying it...as much as i hurt.  Jillian is tough, the workout is tough, but it goes quickly and she is personable enough that i don't think she will become annoying ...as some videos can.  She has a point - if you want to work out for only 20 minutes, it has to be a hard workout: every second must count.  i like the idea of switching between levels to keep the workout from being boring, and i like that she offers modifications so even higher levels can be attainable to keep it fresh and interesting.<br /><br />Worth the money and the time.
0765325950|1.0|I bought and read this atrocity simply to get closure on a series I began reading 23 years ago (jeez). I can honestly say that I'm not surprised by how awful it was or how nonsensical it was or how boring it was or, just, how really bad it was. I can say that I am sad. Sad that even under Robert Jordan's care, the series started declining precipitously and sadder that Mr. Sanderson really botched things up pretty horribly since he took over and mangled the conclusion to this epic series to a degree I find breathtaking.<br /><br />A few things that bothered me, some large and some not:<br /><br />-Demandred: What the *bleep*? As I read the sections with him all I could envision was Mike Tyson from Punchout or Donkey Kong just slamming on his own chest and taking all comers...so long as it was one at a time. Guy can destroy mountains with a wave of his hand but he's busy throwing down in slap fights with anyone that shows up and that, just coincidentally, happens to be any character that doesn't quite have a heroic enough way to die. Awful.<br /><br />-Lanfear: What the *bleep* was she doing in this book?! Seriously, what was her point as a character other than to be a tool for the author to smooth things out for Perrin in a nonsensical stretch of garbage that covered most of the book? AND the way she dies?! May the hand of the Creator cover my mouth because I'm about to start screaming!<br /><br />-Mat: I legitimately skipped most of his chapters until the last battle. Unreadable.<br /><br />-Loial & the Ogiers: Misused. Underused. Abused. Travesty.<br /><br />-Egwene: Opposite of balefire? Really? Reading too much Mercedes Lackey so you felt the need to add some crystals and hokum there Mr. Sanderson?<br /><br />-Min: Why was she even in this?<br /><br />-Moirane: See above.<br /><br />-Faile: See above<br /><br />-Logain: See above. WTF. Why? What a waste.<br /><br />-Nynaeve: See above.<br /><br />-Thom: See above with the addendum of what the *bleep*? Why is he the guy you bring to guard the Dragon in the Last Battle?! WHAAAAT?!<br /><br />-Perrin: There was a whole lot of Street Fighter II action here, with blurring and jumping and biting. Just waiting for Perrin to yell Hadouken(!!) at some point.<br /><br />-RAND: This was the biggest travesty. The \\"fight\\" with the Dark One ended up being the Dragon shouting inspirational lines off posters (Hang in there little kitty!) and reciting pseudo-philosophical non-sense at a scary bad cloud of darkness that was shockingly polite. Lews Therin Telamon led a strike with the Hundred Companions and laid down the law with violence and massive use of the power. Rand had an existentialist moment and went to talk about it with the tall dark stranger who disagreed. I've had tea time with my 4 year old niece that was more exciting.<br /><br />-The Ending: All this leads us to the conclusion. Yuck. There were many, many instances during the book where it was obvious that a steam roller had been used on outstanding plot points and a flamethrower on loose threads but the nonsense to end all nonsense was how the series \\"ended. Imagine if Hallmark redid Tokien but tried to make it \\"dark\\"...and inevitably failed.  Oof.<br /><br />Read the book because if you've been reading them for 20+ years like me you need to but otherwise avoid all the books after Lord of Chaos; even that wasn't great outside the one scene at Dumai's Well but that may have been the last time I got those shivers and was awed by the writing and turn of events in this entire series.<br /><br />What shame should be heaped on Sanderson, the publishers that pushed Jordan to distort his original vision that was so very good, and on Jordan himself (RIP) that allowed it to happen. What a shame. What a shame.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The first half of the book seemed unnecessary to me.  The author could have spent much less time describing Navy Seal training.  We all know that it is rigorous and dangerous. Things became much more interesting once the mission to get Bin Laden was underway.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this to carry my camera kit, and found it it be well built and roomy. I wa somewhat concerned that I would not be able to fit all of my gear inside, but was pleasantly surprised that I was able to fit all of the following in the main compartment: Nikon D90 with attached battery pack and 18-105 mm zoom, 70-300 mm zoom, 10-20 mm zoom, 60 mm fixed super Macro, Speedlight, two small LED flashlights, four extra batteries, a nylon case containing extra memory cards, battery charger and cord. The zippered clear pockets in the cover contain filters, lens wipes, pens, manuals, notepad, pen, pencil and the other usual miscellany that goes along in a camera bag on a shoot. The only thing missing is some way to secure or restrain the back straps in an organized manner when one is just carrying the bag by the handle. Other than that - I find it to be a super value for the money
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This show is fantastic. It keeps you wanting more. The only thing that is disappointing is that there are only two episodes on each disk. I want more!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This is an awesome movie.  Could also be better than the first one.  Hope there is going to be a third to the series!!
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|very dissappointed!  have to turn the kindle away fromme totake picture very difficult to see what you are tryingto take picture of!!
B0024DF9MU|5.0|a great movie and it made me cry, laugh all a round a funny movie for all to really enjoy
0440244412|4.0|This fifth and final book in the fever series is much longer, almost 700 pages, and full of answers and surprises. This isn't my favorite book in the series, that would have to be the second or third, but I was still enthralled enough to read through it in record time. I'll miss Mac's determined sometimes almost poetic voice as the saga's narrator, but since young Dani now has her own series (and a lot of explaining to do) at least her after-the-fall, fae-filled Dublin will continue to evolve in new books.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|This movie is simply lovely.  It's funny, quirky, and all about love.  We watched it in my French 101 class and I went home and bought it that day.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|It was great. Very gripping, and the plot was not revealing. I would definitely recommend it to everyone likes the time period.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Not as good as the first, but still pretty freaking amazing!!!  The Victory Tour is so amazing and heart-wrenching.  Love it!
B005H29GSI|5.0|Nothing tricky here about how to play.  My son with autism simply thinks it's a blast because he can set it up to look like the game he plays on our tablets.
034580404X|1.0|I found the first book to be slow and not very interesting.  I guess I understand why people are shocked and excited about this book-- main stream erotica.  However, to anyone who is an avid reader of any genre for ages 18+, the contents of this book won't be such a big deal.<br /><br />Also, I must admit, I haven't read books two and three; book one was just not good.  Got the trilogy because it was on sale for less than $5 during the Christmas season and I needed a gift for dirty Santa.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This has been a life-saver syncing to my Outlook Express calendar from my desktop without me ever needing to &#34;remind&#34; it to do so.  It keeps everything up-to-date and is easy to  open up and find what I need.  I like that it lets me view as much or as little detail as I want, too.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|This movie is so funny and I love the music.  The costumes and set are bright and fun, plus it has a great message.

B008XNZMOU|4.0|This is not as good as Speak Now but there are a few songs that are very enjoyable and some that are very catchy!  I love Taylor but this album is too pop for me and doesn't show off her voice as well as her previous albums.

B00ADYYBFI|4.0|Got it for $4 so I can't complain. Not really a country fan but I like the show and the music appealed to me because a lot of it doesn't really sound country.
B00A757EFW|4.0|for those of us old enough to remember pacman, this is a great trip down memory lane, buy and have fun
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I enjoyed watching this more than Magic Mike. Hot guys, lots of action, sarcasm, and whit. Did I mention HOT GUYS?!?! I love the Marvel movies. They are generally well written and entertaining.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I purchased this for myself and I am very happy with my purchase! After looking at reviews between this Kindle fire and the Nook, I decided to go for this one, and so far, super happy!
B00899DR40|4.0|I like about half of the songs on the album. It's very upbeat and my daughters, ages 2 and 7, like it. Plus I got it uber cheap :-)
B00005R2M3|5.0|I had always found Shakira to be a visual artist, meaning that I had found her videos more entertaining than her music. But a CD in which we have both languages (Spanish and English) of her selected songs is excellent.<br />I found her native language renditions more compelling than in English but her use of the term 'She-Wolf' is not just a CD title but for her energy in delivering her art.<br /><br />Very Cool Indeed!
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I liked the movie enough to watch it once. I was actually disappointed that there wasn't more to see...if you know what I mean ;-)<br />There was more dancing with clothes on than anything else. The &#34;nude&#34; scenes were short and few and far between. I just expected more stripping out of a movie about male strippers. :-(
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was decently good. Although quite bland towards the middle areas. I didn't like the ending,it was carp and way too predictable.
B00961ZESW|3.0|I only like 3 songs off the whole album. Call Me Maybe, Kiss, and Curiosity. Can't beat the price I paid though.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|Based on a true story..... unaware of the practice of  exorcism done by other religions other than Catholics. This one is really scary!
B009E2U7L2|4.0|I really like 2 songs on the album, and like another 3. So I like half of what's on there but I only paid $4 for the whole thing so I can't complain.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|A friend informed me that I had to check out breaking bad.  I have just finished watching season 1.  Breaking bad is the only series I have seen that could compare with The Wire.  Bryan Cranston is very believable as the main character.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good characters. Lots of thought behind the plot. A little predictable after the confrontations. Over all a really interesting book. Was not sure if I was reading a young adult story or a adult story till three quarters through the story. I really enjoyed it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is such an incredibly well done show.  It's a period piece that has something for everyone.  The characters and the story lines are all great!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I haven't gotten a chance to watch this yet, but at such a good price I couldn't pass up buying it for my daughters first Christmas. She isn't really into movies yet at only 8 months old, but I know in the future she'll love it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|you can draw your stick figure as he goes through differnt scenes it`s just fun to draw with different facial expressions
B008G59IKO|2.0|There is truly nothing new under the sun.  Green Day didn't invent Punk, but they have made it their own, and all 3 band members have signature styles and sounds that, when together, is something identifiably, and uniquely, Green Day, year after year, and through the incarnations. What I never thought I'd hear is Green Day pulling out a tribute album, but that's how I see Dos! Are they Simon and Garfunkle (See You Tonight)? Are they taking tracks I'm likely to hear on a Beasty Boys album (Nightlife)? Or are they a 60's garage rock tribute band--a really, really freakin' GOOD 60's garage rock tribute band?  It appears they are mostly the later here in Dos! I've heard and loved GD from the start, and through the years, but this album struck me as someone else. I have to give it 2 stars, on talent alone, but all I have to say is, thank GOD for Tre! Of them all since Dookie, Dos! is my least favorite from this brilliant trio.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|my daughter tried this game as a demo and she loves it she always playing it on her kindle fire it has something to do with making and building things
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Would be a great game - kids loved it, but it froze my kindle twice in one day so we ended up deleting it.  Also, once you run out of the peanuts you have to purchase more.  You can't get more animals unless you  buy more, so it defeats the purpose.  If they wanted they could allote a number of peanuts each day (like other games do power ups, etc.)  Could have been a really fun game if those two things were fixed!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large numbers you can see for older people. Better than my regular calculator. Would highly recomend this app.<br />Get it.

B004UJAOLM|2.0|A depressing read about deception in all its forms. Very well written just didn't like the story but at the same time I couldn't put it down because I was hoping for  something happy. Weird ending as well.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A Discovery of the Witches<br /><br />\\"It begins with absence and desire. It begins with blood and fear. It begins with a discovery of witches...\\"<br /><br />The Discovery of the Witches is the most fascinating book I have ever read. My God, the amount of knowledge one must possess to be able to write a such complex story.<br /><br />It's not an easy read and don't go in hoping that it is. I think, that in order to completely enjoy and appreciate the story for what it is, and it is a piece of art, in my opinion, you have to have at least some basic knowledge about some of the significant historical events, old books or manuscripts, a little about biology or/and science. You don't have to know the exact details of the events or context of the manuscripts, but you need to at least have heard about dem. The rest is explained.<br />If you think that the chromosome might be some kind of rare plant, that grows in the Amazons, and the DNA is a new boy band, fighting for the spotlight with One Direction, this book is not for you!<br /><br />The story starts with a witch, Diana Bishop, going out and about with her day, doing her research in Oxford's Bodleian Library, going through her everyday routine, but this time, she discovers a very rare manuscript (which actually exists in real life, or existed, to be precise), by accident (?).<br /><br />She is a historian and young scholar at the university, and the descendent of witches. She knows she is a witch, she have known that her whole life, but she refuses to use her magic, because of what happened to her and her family in the past. She wants to be normal. She is aware that the vampires and daemons exists. She can feel them, but refuses to acknowledge dem.<br />The moment she touches the manuscript weird things start happening.<br /><br />Suddenly, she can feel every eye of every witch, vampire and daemon on her. And here is when we meet the vampire and the professor, Matthew de Clairmont. There is a lot of mystery surrounding de Clermont. Even though he is an employ of the university, he doesn't lecture or take on the apprentices. He is known for his studies of neutral mechanisms and prefrontal cortex (whatever the hell that means :-D), and his studies and publications on wolves. Which explains nothing about why he decides to approach Diana Bishop. And that's why Diana decides to dig around for information about him. Why the sudden interest?<br /><br />The more she discovers about him, the more suspicious he looks. But the thing is, Diana have enough secrets of her own.<br /><br />The most amazing thing about this story is the way author describes witches, vampires and daemons. She describes them based on her research, as a historian, and the tales that we (humans) have been passing on to the others, from generation to generation. There are a lot of actual facts. Regardless, if you believe that such creatures exists or not, there were times when people did believe that they did exist.<br /><br />Another thing that amazed me was the way author used historical events, the breakthrough scientific publications and well know classic literature, to twist/super-naturalize it, for it to suit the story, and make me believe that all I knew about it was not as important as I thought it was. It made me believe, that all that, was only a small pieces of the puzzle, of the bigger picture, in the Diana Bishop's and Matthew de Clairmont's story.<br />It was mind blowing.<br />It reminded me a lot of the move The da Vinci Code. That is the only thing that I can compare this book to. In the movie, at the end, outside the church, Tom Hanks says to what's-her-name \\"You know, we never actually found any evidence that Jesus was a \\"he\\" and not a \\"she.\\"\\". Movie ends and you left thinking \\"WTF?!\\". That is pretty much how this book made me feel. It made me doubt everything that I know :).<br />Usually, when I read a book in this genre, I adjust my expectations to sustain degree. I know that there will be either vampires, witches or daemons, that the story is fictional and that anything is possible. But with this story, it was hard to tell where the actual truth ended and the fiction began...<br /><br />This book can be analyzed from many different angles. One might think that it's about forbidden love and overcoming the obstacles. Others might think that it's about more important things like finding the answers to the questions like \\"Who are we? Why are we here? What's our purpose?\\". For me, it's about all of the above.<br />The thing that makes this story so realistic is that witches, daemons and vampires are asking the same questions as we, humans, have been asking for centuries :-D.<br /><br />I don't blame those who gave up on this book halfway through. The first half of the book is slow-paced. Not as in it's boring, but there is not a lot of action going on (fighting, killing, sex and so on). The author goes into a great details explaining things that Diana Bishop comes across or remembers. This book focuses on the fact that knowledge can be just as powerful as the physical strength (Learning, planing, strategizing, then striking). But it suits the story. You can't rush when you are asking such an important questions, right? :-). It have to be properly explained.<br />There are a lot of secrets surrounding two main characters, the mysterious manuscript and supporting characters as well. That is why the story can't be rushed.<br /><br />Even though the book was a 600 page brick and it took me a while to finish, I enjoyed it quiet a bit and can't wait to start the Shadow of Night.<br /><br />\\" Comperi, Comperi' she said.<br />'Merces amb tot meu cor' he said quietly.<br />Al rebeire.

B003Y5HWK4|4.0|the book Sinatra and me is a boring constantly referring to Frank and me the book does not really reveal any real detailed experiences
B007SRWER0|5.0|This book tells the story of the last five years.  Painful to hear, but Stiglitz writes impeccably, and the words are still inflammatory.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I LOVE this show.  I don't have television so I always come to amazon to get my fill the next day. :)  Playback quality is great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|You have to read this....PERIOD! I couldn't put this book down and you won't be able to either! Must read!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This show is definitely not one that everyone will find witty or sensible or even life changing, but it's enjoyable and light-hearted which is what a movie ought to be.
B00006LFGD|4.0|I love Barbara and I most often enjoy duets (in order to include harmony and the complimentary nature of more than a single voice- although I do like duets produced by one singer doing his/her own harmonizing) in preference to a solo voice.  I was, however a bit disappointed in the quality of some.  I don't know if the reason is that possibly old recordings were used (?) - like Sanatra (?).  The majority of the duets, however, I appreciated greatly.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a fun game and can hold your interest for a long time.<br />Cons: You have to buy more coins when you run out.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|What a Talent!!<br />I have several of her CDs which I actually prefer to this one.  The reason is that there were two of the songs<br />which were more &#34;counteer-culture&#34; for my preferences.  The variety of sounds (tunes and accompanyment) I greatly enjoyed and I usually appreciate the entertaining element of her poetry.  This whole CD was no exception to that - what fun play with the words!  I find myself feeling Greedy For More.  Thanks.  You were easy to do business with and I plan/expect to do  so again.  Have a great new year.
B009B0L324|5.0|Live at River Plate is a must have ac/dc album!  These guys are still sounding great and rocking the stage.
B00018D44U|5.0|There was no part of this CD which disappointed me in the least.  I usually play it several times a night - usually along with others of hers, especially her &#34;Come Away With Me.&#34;  Besides her unique voice and instrumentation, I am fascinated by her play with words.  The way she uses rhyme delights me in child-like entertainment.  I only regret she doesn 't live in my neighborhood - on the otherhand.  I'm afraid I would get few of my responsibilities completed.  Therefore, Norah, keep up the great job and continue to work with people who help you accomplish what has happened here.  Thank you all.  Have a great new year.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I read this book while investigating the virtues of low carb diets. I have been active all off my life but recently unable to cut some lbs. I have eliminated wheat from my diet and without changing my exercise pattern have lost 14 lbs in a little over a month. However the benefits go far beyond wt loss as I sleep better and have greater energy.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Can only view about 6 or so of the most recent posts. Not able to scroll down and see several hours/days worth of newsfeed. Find myself having to use my phone more often if I want to see more.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This has to be the best book I've read, going through an illness myself this have me a whole new outlook on everything. A part of me has changed since reading this and I'm glad I picked up such a magnificent book to spend my time reading.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love using Pinterest. App seems easy to use and navigate. Will continue to use on my Kindle Fire often
B0055SWM08|5.0|Soothing game to wind down the tightest wound people. Challenging levels and soothing music. I would recommend it to anyone looking to waste some time.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|My husband wanted these for Christmas and how could you not want these movies? They were awesome as a kid and they are still great now.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I just loved this book! There wasn't one false note or extraneous detail and the characters were so finely drawn and I find myself thinking about them, even now, several days after finishing the story. I had to force myself to close the Kindle, otherwise I would have read it all in one sitting. Great job! I've already downloaded Ms. Moyes's &#34;Last Letter from your Lover.&#34;
B000PMG16U|5.0|These movies are an all time classic. How could you not have the whole collection? ...and buying them off amazon in then two separate packs (episodes I-III and IV-VI) I saved a ton of money.
B006RXQ800|3.0|Like the historical setting and Daniel Day Lewis is excellent. Didn't like DiCaprio or Diaz. This movie is entirely too long.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Typical Nicolas Sparkes, but with so many twists and turns.  So wanted the couple to be able to get together once again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Advancing takes planning and strategy.  Helps develop eyebrows hand coordination.  Keeps the player engaged and teaches patience to win a reward.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie isn't going to blow any minds with its creativity (it follows a fairly standard under-dog formula) or twists, but it's a delicious comedy with delightful performances from Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, and a host of other young actors. The acapella numbers are fun, the characters are interesting and (mostly) non-stereotyped, the dialogue is fresh and witty.  Many have accurately summed this up as the &#34;acapella 'Bring it On,&#34; so if you enjoy humorous female ensembles and/or movies with lots of singing, rent (or buy) Pitch Perfect.
B009D0LBRO|3.0|Really fun game, but is super laggy on my droid x. I recommend it if you have a newer phone
B005DD7JL2|5.0|Great fight sequences that were really loyal to the character's fighting style.  The story line is kind of silly, as it is with all B movies, but it's really entertaining and worth a watch.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the game, when I can get in it. Slow to load and doesn't  at all at the moment i have time to play it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game if you like this type of card game. I will spend hours playing. It beats dealing a real deck of cards at a table. The graphics are good and the hints work well if you need them.
B008CX2A2I|1.0|Adapter doesn't work. iPhone recognizes the Onkyo adapter but it won't connect. Receiver has the latest firmware installed. It should be plug and play, hassle free!
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|I've been a terminator fan since I was a kid and I remember watching this.<br />There isn't really much difference between the blu ray and dvd just a clearer picture with some enhancement but not a lot seeing that this movie was made in the 80's but still worth the money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love to care for my cubed horse without getting dirty or cold. makes me long for my own. thanks for the fun app!
B005LAII3A|3.0|This movie would get higher credits from me if it wasn't a remake of such a good classic.  This could have been an unrelated movie to the original total recall or a prequel or a sequel and I would have liked it better.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The reading plans are great, and this app has so many versions to choose from. This app is very good.
1449415881|5.0|I get this calendar every year for my husband, who has it sitting on his desk at work. All of his co-workers come and read the daily comic. Since our local bookstore closed and the other stores do not carry it, it's Amazon to the rescue.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Large display. Easy to use. Love it for my kindle fire. Wish it had a no sleep function while in use. Love how you can dim the display. Makes me great free app but not sure if the paid version is worth the money.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This is a very good book  l love it . It also was sad :( . But  other than that it was awesome:)
1416955070|4.0|Loved this book....Wasn't sure about it when I first started, but got into it pretty quick.  Just started the second book...
B007IXWKUK|4.0|After reading the second book, I understood the reason for the fifty shades.  I loved the innocence of Anastasia and how she help Gray start addressing the demons in his life. Hot book that kept you engaged.
B000002UB2|5.0|This is love. I can never get rid of this. i can never get tired of this. It is greatness
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the myster of the book.  I could not believe the wife planned her disappearance and she and her husband were co-dependent after all she put him through.  Amy got away with murder which I don't like to see in the end.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Very entertaining and at times a real pageturner.<br />Also a good story about a culture very different from my World.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I didn't want to believe all of the hype surrounding this book - but now I understand. Can't wait to get to the second book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a terrific awesome wonderful game if you like or love horses you would most defentaly like or even love this game
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book so very much. It is so creatively written and I found myself really loving the main character, Charlie. He is this sweet, slightly confused person who is really just trying to figure this complex, interesting world out.<br />He can be funny, serious, sentimental... Charlie definitely found a place in my heart..<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone of age... 13 plus.<br />Like I said, it is very gripping. I didn't want to put it down at all. Ever.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A basic calculator.  It is very easy to use and read.  A plus is that the previous calculation is displayed so it is easy to keep track of where you are when doing a long list of calculations.  Also, you can swipe the memory keys aside for additional functions such as Pi and square root.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three books.  loved the sex scenes, but also liked that it had a little suspense and the story line.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|TWC application provides a wide variety of weather information (hourly to 10 day forecasts, maps, warnings etc.) that can be displayed upon opening the application many locations that you select.<br /><br />Help is not easy to find. Help is under &#34;Settings&#34; as &#34;Tips and Tricks&#34;.<br /><br />Excellent for anyone that wants to know today's or predicted weather.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Clearly aimed at a young male audience, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a must read.  Although times have well and truly chnaged, this book still appeals to the adventurous side of us all.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It was good<br />It was great<br />It was awesome<br />I luv Nicholas sparks<br />Sad story but also sweet<br />Loved it!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Vampire tales, due their popularity, have become ordinary.  Bram Stoker's is far from ordinary; it is the best by far.  Well written and still the creepiest vampire story.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It's nicely filmed and well acted, but the story collapses under its own internal logic. If you're going to tell a time-travel story, you'd better work out the paradoxes in a satisfying way or the whole thing will unravel as soon as the closing credits begin. Unfortunately, that's what happens here. If you think about it even a little bit, you realize that the story just couldn't have gone the way it did, given what happens at the end. I can't go into detail without including spoilers which would ruin the movie for anyone who reads this and still cares to watch it.
B009T9P7OC|3.0|I really liked Jet Audio. But one must-have feature missing is the ability for me to rate my songs (e.g. 0-5 stars).  I wrote the author about this, but never got a response.<br /><br />Another apparent flaw is that Jet seemed to swallow up signals from my bluetooth headset (like pause, forward, etc) when I was running a different music app (PowerAmp); I eventually had to completely uninstall Jet to allow PowerAmp to get the bluetooth signals.  (I had tried several bluetooth \\"routers\\" but Jet seemed to override them).
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I don't use this ap very much but it is nice to have available when I need it.  Works as advertised.
B006RXPTNM|4.0|And embarrassing. The final scene is worth the whole movie. Each actor is wonderful, even the smaller parts. Made me nervous. Needs more recognition.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|This ap was not what I was expecting or what i needed.  I am primarly interested in printing to my local wi-fi printer.  This ap did not work for me. So, I deleted it.
B008D30K7E|5.0|I loved this book. It is entertaining, funny, quirky and sometimes poignant. Allan is a brilliant 100 year-old character whoI would love to call a friend. The double story of Allan's current adventure intertwined with his past escapades with leaders of various countries is compelling and interesting. Allan's attitude to life is refreshingly detached while his humour makes for a brilliant narrative. I thoroughly recommend this book for anyone who is looking for an all-round good tale.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is just perfect. The only problem is having to wait 8 months for the next season. LOVE IT!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I became ‘hooked’ on the series immediately after watching the first show on PBS.  The show is well written and full of surprises as one could expect in any life.  What makes this series special is the attention to detail in the day to day life of the English aristocracy and the real life prejudices against Catholics (some of which still exist in England today with their anti-Catholic laws), the poor and the Irish.  I look forward in seeing more of the series and hope it will be around for several more seasons.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|The authorised such great descriptions and has a perfect story line to follow. I recommend this book to any one at any age.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Good season, didnt like the ending spoiled by the showtime advertisers. Still there's excellent writing and great performances. You just got to love Dexter. Looking forward for next season
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read and I will recommend this book to any one at any age
B003O86FMW|5.0|I haven't read a series of books since high school. Absolutely absorbed this book. Can't wait to read Mockingjay. Love!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is worth buying. it is entertaining and a learning experience. Plus, it' s free! I would get this game.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The story itself is very well written and it is an interesting plot. But I found the characters to be quite disturbing
B00992CF6W|5.0|amazing app totally worth the money just wish there would be an update<br /><br />hsh hshz yev euhdy udvd Dvd d d d d d d yegd dh d
B008HTQ28K|4.0|True Grisham style. interesting story, well written, good angles. I took this one on a beach-side holiday...good choice for easy afternoons
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. Can play it for hours without getting any errors. I would recommend this to anyone that loves this card game.
B007G92QGO|4.0|This story is a continuous build-up to the unpredictable ending. Its almost like you are swaying along in a gentle rhythm, taking you from side-to-side, and you are never truly allowed to take a firm position...at least I never did! Its what kept me turning the pages
B008I43DYU|5.0|I love the fact that this calculator is so big to see & easy enough  for my little neice to use.
B0000714BP|5.0|This is a funny movie.  But it does some serious poking at gay bashing and domestic violence. Patrick Swayze, Wesely Snipes, and John Leguizamo are powerful actors in this movie.  One of my favorites
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|There were a couple of things that were not abundantly clear when I purchased this book. 1) It is self-published. 2) It really is YA lit (though I would NEVER let my daughter ready it). If I had known just one of those two facts, I probably would not have purchased it.<br /><br />The crazy, dysfunctional relationship between Abby and Travis is thoroughly covered in other reviews, so I will comment on the writing itself -- uninspired, clumsy, vague. Often I had to go back through a conversation to figure out what was really going on. I am not a stupid person, but some of the dialogue just doesn't track in any logical or satisfying manner. A strong editor would have helped for sure.<br /><br />In addition, the pacing of the book is s..l..o..w.. A whole bunch of nothing happens. Sure, there are dates and parties and whatnot, but nothing ever really HAPPENS. Maybe that is what some people expect of YA lit, but I certainly expect an age-appropriate story with REAL characters, and REAL problems, and REAL consequences for their choices. This book offers none of those.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to anyone. Sure, it is a quick \\"beach\\" read, but there are a plethora of better options than this one.
B005T87QCI|5.0|this game can not download ;this game is the worst<br />I would advise you not to download ; will regret this game
B003L16FAE|1.0|Predator (Ultimate Hunter Edition) [Blu-ray]  unfortunately doesn't play in the PS3. I have had Amazon swap it out and it still will not play. This is the only Blu Ray I have ever had an issue with.<br />I assume that the DRM has gotten to the point of cutting out one of the world's most popular Blu Ray players. Good Game DRM, protecting consumers from a great movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Reminds me of a tamogotchi kinda. I like how the jobs don't all take forever, it would be cool if the unicorns weren't so expensive :)
B005LAIGW8|3.0|Didn't like how this movie portrays the Ghost Rider. He seems like a totally different person. Maybe that enough time has passed, that he seemed strange, and looked stranger, meaner. This is just an ok movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game has been very successful for me to be honest this is my favorite game. I just love it so much. That's why I personally like this game.
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present. This camera has a horrible lag from when the shutter button is pressed to when it actually goes off.  This makes it really difficult for kids to capture a non-blurry image.  We didn't expect very good quality for the images but the quality is really quite bad.  My daughter loved it anyway, but after a couple weeks the camera started corrupting the images.  It wasn't long before the whole thing went T.U.  We've been trying to get a hold of customer service but no one is contacting us about a replacement.  All and all, a pretty bad experience.  Really bummed because this was a present for my kid.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I bought this app for my daughter who is 19 months old.  She loves looking at the moon.  The images are spectacularly clear and vivid and it's fun to have the ability to change the phase and see what it will look like.  We can follow the calender to see what it will look like in the week ahead.  My daughter can do this by herself or with me and she loves that she can see a real moon at any time of day or month.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|I wasn't expecting too much but was really blown away - it's a great, funny, touching, and very real to life story.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Not a lot of content about his new. Too technical. I was wanting more heaven experiences to be told in the story.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This has to be one of the best movie that has to do with the US navy, army, marines you name it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I had coin dozed on my phone and now on my kindle I love it so fun I hope you like it to one of the best games ever p.s. keep the whistles and other prizes to unlock things. You have to try it
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy is awesome. The second book being the most intriguing and interesting. But as a whole the trilogy is a must buy.
0765325950|3.0|Wow, how to write a review without mentioning specific things...hmmm.  Well, I was mostly disappointed in this final book.  Although there were moments of greatness,  as with The Amarilyn's character, there were many really boring parts. I, for one, don't need page after page to describe a battle scene or to understand something I've been reading about for three years (Wolf Dream). The majority of Perrin's part could have, and I think should have, been condensed. I also feel entire groups of people were left without resolution, as well as many of the many semi-main characters. Yet, Sanderson chose to bring back in a character that no one would have really noticed if he wasn't there (Huron). It seemed like Sanderson focused more on the Last 'Battle' than on the characters. I love these books mostly because of the characters not the battles; although the battles were well written until now (overwritten). I was simply disappointed with what story lines Sanderson chose to tie up and which he didn't. The Dragons were great!  I guess I expected a spectacular ending to a spectacular series and I don't feel I got that. I will probably write a more comprehensive review in a few months with spoilers and disappointments that need to be addressed after I reread the book (want to make sure it isn't simply a case of my expecting too much). I commend Mr. Sanderson for taking on this incredible project. The first books he wrote were stupendous, but this last one missed the boat for me.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|well written and very emotional, the details of air combate made you feel you were there.both on the american side and the german side
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the concept of it &amp; easy to understand interface. I have tinnitus in my ears so bad &amp; used to go to sleep with the TV on which is not a very relaxing sound distraction nor does it provide a healthy sublimal restfulness. Hope that you guys keep updating it with new sounds! How about a distant fog horn? A cat purring? Wind over a wheat field? The emptiness of space? An echoing gong? A little girl humming a melody? You have a good thing going here, keep going with it!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|well done with some really good sounds. much better than others I have tried. plus free sounds to download online. thanks.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Love the app. looking forward to using it more in the future.  I was really happy to find it mat this time.
B000006YCU|4.0|I really like the songs on this album, they sound like Dream Theater's later songs only a bit more garage band style; the singer (forgot his name) sounds a bit like Geddy Lee. However it sounds like it was recorded in someone's basement, which is really a shame.
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|This was a good movie and moved along pretty well. It was hard for me to watch this without thinking of QuickSilver. But in this world of remaking old movies, I guess it's ok. Well worth your time to watch.
B00008EPZ8|5.0|I got this as a gift, and the person who received it was delighted.  She said: &#34;sounds just as good as it sounded when I first heard it a long time ago! &#34;  I'm glad I got it for her, and the shipper sent it very rapidly.
1609611543|5.0|It was Amazon.com book search that led me to the Wheat Belly solution by Dr. Davis.  I already had used the principles of the Zone diet, but it still allows some wheat products, even though, if you can afford the food and the prep time, it is an excellent plan.  I'd been sick with diverticulitis after the indulgences of the holidays and a PacNW fall darktime carbo fest. I pulled out my Zone books to inspire myself back to healthy eating, but felt something was missing with Zone eating.  Or, rather, NOT missing.  I never really lost much weight on it, and whenever I followed it religiously I suffered from insomnia and hypomania at night.  Also, Too controlled daily menu.  \\"Just don't eat wheat\\" for a while appealed to my need for simplicity.  I asked myself how hard it could be to just start by giving up one food, so I did, just a week ago. From day one my carbo junkie cravings just disappeared, and I no longer found myself distracted in the evening by compulsive thoughts about the snack potential in the kitchen. Even though I'd mostly eschewed sugar and most simple carbs for decades. Without wheat, I was not hungry anymore, in fact, I had to push myself to go make a meal as interest in eating diminished.  Without wheat I had to rely more on veggies and a little fruit.  I was a sandwich person, so I switched to lettuce roll ups which I love.  Also have lean protein at each meal in healthy proportions.  Well, I lost a pound a day, probably water, at first, and now have dropped 5 lbs in a week. I look a bit better.  My bowel issues have abated nicely, and I feel I have dodged a \\"bullet\\" at 70 yo in that regard, though I realize I will need to continue to improve my lifestyle and diet. I've always suspected that something in my diet was incompatible with my body, but whenever I read the list of possible allergens, it was so comprehensive, I couldn't decide which foods to eliminate.  I believe that if we can learn to eliminate the worst offender-food, we may be enabled to give up others and even tobacco and alcohol for anyone who is addicted to those. I will keep to the plan and watch to see results when I go in March for my annual checkup, weigh in  and tests.  Thank You, Doctor, Bravo!
B000002MFQ|3.0|I got this as a gift, and the receiver said: &#34;Tub. Bells II, turns out, I never heard before.  It isn't nearly as good as the 1st one.  Wouldn't recommend it to anyone who thinks it will be like #1; they'll be disappointed.&#34;  The shipper on this one was quite a bit slower, but everything arrived just fine.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|this is a fantastic and entertaining game. as soon as i saw it i knew i needed to have it. beware, the difficulty is quite hard, i'm still stuck on step 30 of ~125.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a great idea.  Who doesn't need a flashlight on their Kindle.  Beats carrying around a separate one. I Plan to use it when I go camping.
B004OKFISQ|1.0|Whoever remastered this has applied too much in the bass, spoiling this classic album. What is it with today's recording engineers? Don't they actually listen. Rubbish.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting... can't wait for every next episode.  I would say though that the plot is a bit more predictable at times
B00A8ECU24|4.0|very cool and relaxing. fun for most ages. hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do! amazing, great, and exciting.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Great read, fascinating history, plausible tale of our \\"what if\\" history! Action packed. I love the mundane distraction of family life during breakneck speed adventures. Super spy with a mom.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is a classic for me. It's one I love to go back and see every now and then, which is why I bought it. Beautifully acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, it's a story with enormous depth. What I appreciate is the exploration of the inward struggle to rise above the definition imposed on us by society. It's about the ability to retain hope, and the way life puts it before us to choose hope - or not.  &#34;Get busy livin', or get busy dyin',&#34; as Morgan Freeman says in the film.  I love that.  Something we all need to reminded of from time to time.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|Look for omens and interpret them the right way.<br />Help will show up to fulfill your dreams if you understand and listen.<br />You will succeed if your heart is in your dream.<br /><br />Sounds a bit like Jimminy Cricket singing, &#34;Wish Upon A Star&#34;.<br />If the sheriff shows up to kick you out and lock the door, then you probably did not recognize the omens and the help that was sent.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I like every thing about this game. It is a great way to kill time.<br />Very enjoyable and makes you think about your next move.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love horses and i have no land to have my own so this game is perfect. best horse game!!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry birds star wars.  Fabulos It has a lot of chállenges and like the graphics<br />cant figure out codes yet.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I'm using it and loving it.  It's giving my old Kindle a real boost of energy, which it badly needed, till I give in to the times and purchase a kindle Fire.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is a great quick read dealing with a happening witnessed by the 16-year old daughter at her childhood home.  The book takes the reader from present time to WWII England as the daughter weaves together the reasons for the crime she witnessed as a child.<br /><br />The characters are well developed and the plot will keep you intrigued.  While you may guess some of the connections there are surprises up until the very end.<br /><br />An enjoyable read for fiction but not if you're looking for a book laced in historical fiction.  While it does imprint some of the trials of living through WWII, mostly it is a book about family, mother-daughter connections, and how a secret can impact the lives of many through decades.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I also read this book as a child and re-read it as an adult, finding it just as magical, tender and great as I did back then.  It's a book for children and adults alike.
B00005JM02|5.0|The item was in a great condition.  I gave it five stars because it arrived exactly when promised. I would recoment it to a friend. Quality was excellent.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|What can I say about this gem that hasn't been said before?  With the successful Broadway play and new movie, more and more people are discovering Victor Hugo's timeless masterpiece, and all I've got to say is &#34;it's about time.&#34;  I had that honor and priviledge at the tender age of twelve years old.
B0044KN1HG|5.0|I gave it a five star, because it was in a great condition.  I am satisfied with my purchase. I would most definitely recomend this to my friends. The movie also arrived on time.
B00846REIS|5.0|Was curious if it was going to be too similar to 50 shades of grey. It proved me wrong! I can't wait to read the other book!
0425263916|5.0|First book Bare to You was excitement,fun,and romances all over that i couldn,t stop reading it.<br />&#34;Reflected in You &#34; was not interested at all, not until the last chapter. She was so into him,love him, even if he treated her like nothing? All the secrects he kept from her.<br /><br />They kept chasing each other back amd forth, i didn't get it, its borring.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|This movie shows how humans have done nothing but rely on macine to do EVERYTHING for them.  Do to the way they treated our planet Earth with non recyable garbage.  Wall-e is a robot that seems to be the last of his kind.  His job is to gather garbage left by the humans and neatly pile it high.  He meets another robot and the story begins.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very, Very hot & kept you interested in the book the entire time. Read this book in 1 day, could not put it down.....
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I really like the watch.Everything about the watch shows real quality.<br />I would prefer the watch a little larger case
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this app. Some great default sounds...  like brown noise the best and the fact that you can set timers to turn off the noise and set alarms to wake up. Fntastic!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! It was romantic , dramatic , and it kept me on the edge of my seat!!!!
0345803507|5.0|Can't wait for the movie...Amazon is great, reliable and perfect for receiving books in a quick manner!  Love my Amazon!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was really really good, getting ready to read the next one! Can't wait to see what happens in it.
B0012GVKVY|5.0|I won't get into a summary of the plot, my opinions on the acting or a comparison to the original movie. All science fiction eventually becomes reality, one just has to read the old Jules Verne novels and most all he predicted has come to pass.  Perhaps, with iRobot, Asimov's vision of the future may also come to be reality.  Suffice it to say that this film is well done, tense and draws you into a truly popcorn movie. I only review the quality of the Blu Ray disc itself. I do  have the Standard Def version as well.<br /><br />The Standard Def DVD was actually pretty well made; its video and audio were both very good so I do not believe that you will see a night and day difference between the SD DVD and this BluRay.<br />That said, the BluRay transfer is excellent with no grain or artifacting at all.  Granted, you wouldn't expect to see grain in any CGI clip, but there are plenty of scenes that are not wholly CGI and the film retains true skin tones, a very nice contrast and warm color grading.  No problems that I can see with the video transfer to Blu Ray which is why I gave it a 5.<br /><br />The audio transfer is also excellent in lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 and the audio could easily be used for DEMO disc purposes at it utilizes the entire surround system with a great deal of discreet channeling to the rear stage and from front and rear with realistic panning when appropriate.  However, as I said for the Standard Def version, its audio was also extremely well edited so the big difference is that this audio, being lossless with a larger bit rate, makes for a more enveloping sound track.<br /><br />  There are extras, a commentary, an alternate ending and CGI renditions of endings as well.  If you do not already have a copy of iRobot, despite its age, the film retains sturdy legs and is well worth having in your collection, especially at such an inexpensive cost.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksso check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Like it but was wanting offline version so i could use it everywhere it would be the only one i would need because  of all the different books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and thus declare it is awesome coming from someone who has this version, Xbox 360 version, and computer version.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! I think it is a great game for younger and older horse lover's. I think the game is actually real life situations and caring.
B003E8P9G0|3.0|The plot was fast moving and inventive but the writing seemed a little juvenile. I would recommend this to my grandson, it's right up his alley. I may read more of the series just to keep tabs on what he is reading. From reviews I've read about Riordan I expected more
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Seemed a bit rushed but very realistic I hope there is more to follow very soon, it is a terrific series
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I could not put it down.  I had not read much about the time period of the book and I found it very interesting.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|A truly different kind of story with an upbeat and refreshing message of the power of friendship, loyalty and love.  I would recommend this book as a reminder of what havoc and misery war thrusts on simple human beings and, in spite of this, the strength of the human spirit to overcome darkness and evil through acts of kindness and love for our fellow human beings.
B008MEM24S|2.0|This app update does not work on kindle fire.<br />dissappointing. I thought Disney apps were designed much better than that. wasted my money.
0385535147|4.0|I'm a huge John Grisham fan and thought this book was one of his better stories; was very hard to put this book down!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love this app for my Kindle device.It's great & easy to use when I need to look something up & it will even save the last thing that I looked up:)
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|The alarm works very well, but must be plugged in or the charge will run out before morning.  I like all the tones offered. I had a little trouble getting it to work because i thought it would turn itself on. It doesn't.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Genuine characters and dialogue. This was a thought provoking book. I would highly recommend. Although I would have preferred a different ending, I believe anyone would enjoy this reading.
B009RH973I|5.0|I am very pleased with this purchase. The case fits my Kindle Fire HD perfectly--and the bright pink color makes it easy to find in my bag. The standing feature worked perfectly on a recent long air flight, allowing me to watch a movie hands-free ad comfortable. The case is sturdy and I feel safe in placing my Kindle in a suitcase or bag.
B001CVMD4M|5.0|They made history with so many great hit songs in England and in the USA...  I think they're the best girl group ever, yes?<br /><br />Hollywd
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Could of slowed down a little so we could enjoyed something other than just the action. It had some of the best Actors around, who can speak and act.  They were kind of wasted here.  However, if you like loud noises, great action this movie is for you.
B000002VQQ|5.0|This album was one of the most influential of both my & my buddies lives. It got played to death but you could never tire of it, & so many years later it still holds up so well. It made me a Patti Smith fan for life.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|It is over the top fun for all.  Aaron Taylor-Johnson and  Chloë Grace Moretz performances make this movie.  It is Great from beginning to end.  Enjoyed it 100%.  Can be watched over and over, as it is never dull .
1597771791|5.0|What a wonderful read!!!! I listened to the audio book and then I watched the movie and what a treat.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Kept on the edge of your recliner and split some popcorn with the BOOMing action scenes.  Great kid movie, like I said reminds me of the Goonies.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I have really liked this book because it was funny, weird, a laugh out loud, and a comic book wrapped in one<br /><br />  Sierra Alexis Russell
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I just bought the game today and its so much fun!!! It's like CoD only portable and diffrent campaign.  The graphics make you feel like your playing Xbox 360. The multiplayer is my favorite. It's the best game you can invest in for the Kindle. DEFENTETLY worth $6.99. If you dont like the part where you shoot off peoples heads and arms, then there is a gore setting in the options. There is still blood and language though. If your a adult or kid hho likes war games, this game is for you!
B00A2XU9IS|3.0|Grandchildren like it.  It was entertaining.  Probably will do it again next year.<br />Good use of numbers for the smaller children.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I enjoyed every one Riordan's books and loved this one the most. As you know from the last book Gaea is trying to take over the world but Percy and the gang are determined to stop her. The book includes a lot of Annabeth's adventure to find the Mark of Athena. This includes the perfect amount of adventure, love, and conflict between friends. I can't wait for the next one. This book is perfect for kids between 4th and 8th grade.
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|Special fx were outstanding, story was okay. Seemed very odd we did not get to see Dredd's face or learn why he was a loaner, tough and the best judge.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It was fun to read the twists with Rapp's character as well as the return of the assassin that killed his wife.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It's an amazing book I loved it especially jace and Clary romance and then finding out they were siblings just wow
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This is a great movie to watch when you just want something light and frothy. The musical numbers are entertaining enough and Rebel Wilson is totally wonderful in it (of course she is, she's amazing) - but it was just OK otherwise.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever played and its free it is perfect for the kindle fire hd
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I LOVE Season 1 of &#34;New Girl.&#34; I have watched almost all of the episodes repeatedly and I still laugh as hard as I did during the first viewings. I love the dynamic among all the main characters. Renting (or buying) &#34;New Girl&#34; for Schmidt (Max Greenfield) alone is worth it just for him!
B004W2UBYW|3.0|Glad I read about Steve's life. Interesting person.  Instead of grouping the stories by topics (eg his work vs his personal life), I would have liked everything together to better appreciate what was going on in his life. For example, who was Steve with at the time when he created... the iPhone for example. This might explain certain behaviors. Instead when presented by topics, this one sides review at the time portrays Steve a bit odd but makes more sense when I finish all topics within a certain time in his life. Just a personal preference.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Being of the generational age that we are, we absolutely delight in anything Tony does musically.  This album is really a testament to his ability to sing anything with anyone and make it a pleasure to listen to.  It's always in our car CD player when we are travelling.  Great stuff!!
1574214276|5.0|This book has great illustrations of different patterns.  It has opened up a new and exciting love for drawing and relaxation.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|You will love the characters & the actors are just marvelous.  The settings & costumes are remarkable.  Can't wait to get more of this series!
0062073486|5.0|I loved the book And Then There Were None.  I myself am not a big mystery fan, but this book was my exception. Every part of it made it more and more interesting and I wanted to read more. It was definitely a page turner, that I simply did not want to put down. The aspect I liked most about this book was how Agatha Christie related all the deaths to the toy solider poem and how every time someone died there was a glass solider removed from that table. It added a spooky element that I thoroughly enjoyed. When you find out who did this murder it is a total left hook, you do not see it coming.<br />In the beginning however I found the book kind of hard to keep up with. There were so many characters being thrown at you at once, I had to reread it a few times to fully understand. However, I kept reading and as I learned more about each character, it became increasingly easier to understand.<br /> I thought that the characters were very compelling, each in their own way. The character I specifically enjoyed the most was Miss Vera Claythorne. She was a tough old lady, who held her own throughout the dreadful experience. I found her very interesting particularly her back story, and how it simply drove her mad. I do not want to state too much more because it will give ruin the experience.<br />Another thing I really enjoyed about this book was how diverse Agatha Christie made each character. No two characters were alike. She really went into detail with every single character so you felt like you knew them. The sub-stories she developed for each character were not simple stories, they were complex with intriguing turns every step of the way. I can only imagine the amount of thought she put into each character, because each character left a clear and vivid picture in my mind. This book was very spooky; I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 15 simply because it is a very scary book with advanced language.<br /> Agatha Christie did an amazing job at keeping the suspense throughout the whole book, and showing the fear that each character was experiencing. There were some parts in this book that actually gave me the chills. The thing that I find most astonishing is how Agatha Christies was able to create an enthralling story about these people who would come to an island invited by an unknown man who they cannot even recall meeting. How Miss Christie came up with the plot and was able to develop it into such a suspenseful and entertaining novel is simply beyond me. I loved this book I am thinking about doing it for a big paper next year, because Agatha Christie is a truly brilliant author. I enjoyed this whole entire book and I strongly recommend it. 5 stars!e throughout the whole book, and showing the fear that each character was experiencing.

B00632HWOG|5.0|Enjoy being able to read email from friends when not at my regular computer. Easy to keep in contact with friends that way
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Wanted to read this book based on reviews. So far so good, actually very good.  Good character development, makes history come alive and I'm learning as well as enjoying.  This is my first book by this author and look forward to reading more.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|We just signed onto the Draw Something program but have not been able to use it yet. Looks like a fun game to learn.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|The headsets sound quality is superb all round, the game, chat and bass alternating is really useful, as it is easy to find what suits you. The bass is excellent in the headset if you want to experience all the possible ranges of sound BUT they brake so easily i have had trouble with the switches braking for the expander, one side of the hs sound being muffled and really annoyingly having the chat not come through on the headsset due to some terrible wire connecting. Overall not worth the money get Triton's, They are more robust and just as good just wish i hadn't wasted my money on these.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Rare I read a series that in the ed I wish there was more this is one of the rare ones.  Strong female heroine good over evil Don't trust the government what is there not to like
B001706I5I|5.0|I have never watched this movie before but was totally entertained by the entirety of it! I spent more time trying to figure out how the makeup people made all the people's noses look the way they did.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love how its kind of like an anthology and a biography. The many stories are intriguing and the characters are amazing. Each story has a unique view and each story really gets you sucked in. Loved it a lot even though I didn't expect much.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Received a notification from Yahoo that my online account was attacked from an IP address in Turkey. Whoever it was hijacked my account to spam everyone in my contact list.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Dude, its the Nolan Batman trilogy on Blu-Ray... If there were 6 or 7 stars, I would give it that!<br />If you haven't seen these, muster all your strength, push upwards very hard to move that rock you have apparently been living under and watch these!
0812993357|5.0|Right off the bat, I knew I would love this memoir because the first sentence of the Introduction opens with: \\"The first I heard of The September Issue, the movie that is the only reason that anyone has ever heard of me,...\\"<br /><br />I knew I would love this book because that opening IS SO TRUE FOR ME. I did not know who Grace Coddington was until I watched The September Issue on netflix or somesuch service like it.<br /><br />And like many, I was intrigued by the pale, wild-haired, believer-in-the-model-for-modeling counterpoint to the frostier but equally determined Anna Wintour.<br /><br />So when I saw this book comes across my screen, I snapped it up and then promptly held off on reading it until I finished reading a few other books that I knew I had to read or else I'd never read them.<br /><br />And the wait was so worth. Delightful, chatty, and charming, Coddington is at once forthright and welcoming. Her memoir is both time capsule of the era in which she grew up and a timeline of the growth of the fashion industry from 1960s to the present.<br /><br />In all of it, from her rise in modeling to the accident that disfigured her to her ascent as a creative force for British and American Vogue, Coddington makes it all seem like a long conversation with the most interesting friend (if she is your age) or aunt (if she is much older) you will ever ever have or meet.<br /><br />Very enjoyable and I loved it.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|Good 'ol Arnold's finest performance comes to Blu-ray with \\"The Terminator.\\"<br /><br />This film is known for being one of the most popular Sci-Fi films of all time. It has it all. Action. Adventure. Austrian stop-motion robots. It's a classic for a reason.<br />Enjoy everybody!<br /><br />Famous line - \\"I'll be back.\\"<br />Arnold did too, with another fine film you should check out: [[ASIN:B001RIY4WE Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />So yeah.<br />Watch \\"The Terminator.\\"
B001MS7IBS|5.0|Absolutely love it!<br />Been waiting to sit down and watch this show in its true form, Bluray! Waiting for season 5

B003L77G38|5.0|Been waiting for years to sit down and watch show after show. Just keeps getting more intense. Can't wait for the 5th season!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|LOVE IT! I RECOMMEND READING! Get all the books in the series, well worth the read. Could even read it more than once.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|Beautiful love story Showed people can overcome very bad things and with help from others start over.Can't wait to see the movie
B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|Loved this flick, watched it twice. Great acting . Terrific period piece and a true story to boot. Highly recommend
B0076DCT2G|5.0|It was a real thriller and action packed. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Real characters in a possibly real situation
B009OYTAL8|4.0|This episode was broadcast during the aftermath of super storm Sandy, and hasn't been rerun.  Problem with a series like Arrow, is that each episode reveal bits of info critical to the overall storyline.  This is one of the more critical in that regard.<br /><br />What I didn't like has NOTHING to do with the content, but how it played on my computer.  Audio were out-of-sync with the video, and it was weird watching lips moving after a character completed his/her lines.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was very good.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any kid or adult over 6 years old.<br /><br />I think that the book should have more.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I bought the CD because of Thrift Shop but there are so many great songs on here. Some of them have a great message too, like &#34;Same Love&#34; which was written to support gay marriage. Something you wouldn't expect from just hearing the thrift shop song
B007HACDLK|5.0|I always look forward to the next Mitch Rapp assignment. This book is a page turner as they all have been. Hard to put down. Every turn, every paragraph full of suspense. I hope there are people like Mitch in our clandestine services that do get the job done and keep us safe. Well done Mr Flynn!
B007G5H2HQ|4.0|And I love Antonio Banderas in whatever he does.  It's a little on the long side even for Antonio. The humor is really cute.
B008BQ8YHQ|3.0|Good show about lawyers. The only downside is that its pretty predictable. But, overall good. Louis cracks me up. fun, fun!
0385535147|2.0|The first fifty-or-so pages of \\"The Racketeer\\" were alright, but after that, the book devolved into unmitigated banality.  There were too many coincidences in the plot, the pacing was choppy, and the ending was profoundly anticlimactic.  I can almost hear the conversation which led to the publication of \\"The Racketeer\\":<br /><br />(A phone rings in a Mississippi mansion.  A well-known, snappily dressed fiction author answers it.)<br /><br />John Grisham: Hello.<br /><br />Literary Agent: John, babe.  It's Maury in New York.  How are ya?<br /><br />JG: Great Maury, how are you?<br /><br />LA: Aces, babe.  Listen, I have a publisher snapping at my heels for a new book.  When's your next project gonna be finished?<br /><br />JG: Um, well, I'm working on an in-depth character study right now.  It's called \\"The Racketeer,\\" and it's about a black lawyer who's sent to prison for ten years for a very specious white-collar conviction.  I want this book to explore some of the ways good people are destroyed by overzealous prosecutors who misuse RICO laws.<br /><br />LA: Well John, that sounds great and all, but we need to get product out there now.  When's \\"The Racketeer\\" gonna be complete?<br /><br />JG: I'm not sure.  Like I say, I want to create a complex, character-driven piece which explores some of the complicated issues facing our fallible criminal justice system.<br /><br />LA: Ooookay.  Depth is all well and good John, but let's not kid ourselves.  You know as well as I do that the public just wants pat answers and escapist plots these days.  I mean, we're not, like, living in the 1970s or anything for Christ's sake.<br /><br />JG: Well Maury, I want this book to have some real depth.  This character, Malcolm Bannister, has the potential to illuminate some intriguing insights about the current state of our federal prisons.  I'm about halfway through \\"The Racketeer\\" now, and I'd really like this book to be a work of substance.<br /><br />LA: What if I have one of my guys drive a dump truck full of money over to your place?<br /><br />(The Literary Agent hears salivating on the other end of the line.)<br /><br />JG: What was that about depth?  Sorry, Maury.  I must have been high off the paint fumes coming from the new wing of my mansion.  Let me tack an ending onto \\"The Racketeer\\" and I'll get it out to ya'll by the end of the week.<br /><br />LA: Aces, babe.<br /><br />The bottom line: John Grisham must have been hard up for a new ivory backscratcher to put his name on this schlock.  If you want to read Grisham at his finest, pick up a copy of \\"The Innocent Man.\\"  It's genuinely compelling, timely, and heartfelt.
0762445262|5.0|It was slightly smaller than I expected, but it was still totally awesome. I am a total bat-nerd and I love it!
B004D7GU3C|4.0|Love the music and variety of rhythms on this album. Great songs that I just can't get out of my head.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The writing is so detailed And vivid I had to force myself to stop reading. I can't wait to read the next two.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good clean plot with suspense. It also addresses the problem of wife abusive. The story moves fast but has enough details to make it interesting.
0764574124|5.0|Excellent shape, fast shipping and received very quickly.<br /><br />What's with this minimum number of words &#34;required&#34;? For me it is a reason not to do reviews.<br /><br />I think Amazon should rethink this.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book had me hooked from the very beginning and left me with as many questions as answers. It was beautifully written, emotionally exhausting, and wonderful from the interwoven love story to the surprising conclusion. Hardly a moment in the complex and relevant plot to come up for air. I loved it enough to write a review!
B008NEVPCC|5.0|got cd for girlfriend for christmas and she loved it. i would recommend this cd to anyone who likes this music.
B009WHLR9K|5.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I need to mention that I'm a HUGE fan of Rafa, but that doesn't necessarily explain why I love the book. I was a HUGE fan of Boris Becker before he retired, but didn't like his autobiography so much...but I digress...<br /><br />It does help to know and to a small extent like/respect the person you are reading about, but this book is excellent for several reasons:<br />1. The format is great - alternating chapters written by Rafa and Carlin make it interesting and non-monotonous and gives different perspectives throughtout the book.<br />2. It's very gripping - the writing style as well as content make the book feel like a thriller although as a tennis fan you know the outcome of every single match they are talking about.<br />3. An all-round focus - the book doesn't dwell solely on technique or family or mental preparation etc, but has a good mix of a all these things and more.<br />4. A great insight to \\"why he is the way he is\\" - be it his humility or his mental strength or left handedness or his top spin, Rafa stands apart from most of his colleagues and is a unique personality. This book has the answers to the WHYs.<br />5. As somebody else has mentioned, this is a great book for parents in general - different personalities with different approaches to parenting/disciplining have had such a great impact on Rafa's life and this is one of the constant threads in the book - makes it a very interesting read...<br /><br />Lastly, before I read the book, I thought it was too premature to release a biography at Rafa's age and stage of his career, but after reading it feel it was perfect timing indeed! It's more fun to watch a person's game when you \\"know\\" the person the way you would once you read this book!
1936608618|5.0|Reliable seller, terrific book for anyone looking to improve skills, mobilization and proper form... a true one stop shop. A must have.
1594487154|3.0|I read all of Dan Pink books and this wasn't my favorite. It had a lot of interesting research and case studies but it didn't seem as easy to apply compared to his book Drive. I'd still recommend this book to someone that is struggling to influence a specific situation in their life.
B00A0ABQLM|1.0|UPDATE:<br /><br />I had given a 5-star review based on the fact that it worked fine on the Macbook Air. However, after about 2 weeks of working fine, it just completely died today. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers, but that did not do anything. I am returning for a refund, as an exchange is not available.<br />_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Don't bother with the little CD (where do you stick THAT into the Macbook Air, LOL!). Do a search for \\"ASIX AX88179 OS X driver\\", download, install, reboot, connect, profit! BTW, you don't need to bother with creating a Network Interface manually (as the documentation that comes with the driver says). Take a look and see if one was automatically created for you (it was for me); if not, you can always create it manually per the documentation. SO nice that I don't have the Thunderbolt port occupied for Ethernet purposes, so I can connect a display or a projector that port. Only complaint is that it doesn't come in an Apple White color ;) Speed seems fine to me, although I have not done any scientific tests (no need, it is good enough!)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It is helpful for unwinding after a hectic day, soothing when you are sick, and is a wonderful sleep aid!!!  Love it!!
B00000JQFM|5.0|The best guitarist.  You really need to watch his interview on YouTube.  It's amazing how much he knows about music  With Amazon cloud it's definitely a plus.
0307895475|5.0|I rated this five stars because the actual guide is what I wanted. Pages and pages of information for the gaming nerd.<br /><br />HOWEVER! The packaging was HORRIBLE! The book was barely secured and the front corner of it was folded over and was cracked on the front. A little bit of black marker made it less noticeable. The rest of the page corners were folded over as well. Yes it is still usable, but it is disheartening to order something new and it was imperfect when opening it. I shouldn't have to fix something new! It did arrive fast but wished it was better packaged.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I was skeptical but it worked perfectly only bad problem was after long night of drinking I threw it on and the rain crap made me piss my self! Now only if they added a hot chick talking!
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|I shouldn't really being telling you this, but Fight Club is the s*** If you haven't seen it, get it now.
B00B59D1YC|5.0|I agree with another reviewer that reality shows suck and I refuse to watch any of them. They are cheap to make and I think they are contributing to the dumbing down of things. This show is  great from the get go and I love tuning in each week to see what happens. I was nicely surprised to find that the lead actor does most of his own stunts and it shows. He does a marvelous job and the scene from a couple of episodes ago where he got shot with arrows and broke them off against a dumpster made me cringe and I could feel his pain. Jeez it was realistic, yet it balances nicely with a little thoughtfulness about what he is doing.  I highly recommend this show to watch and I hope that it keeps on being well written and acted. I hope that it is on for a long time to come. If you are lover of comic book super hero type stuff then this is one of the best so far. You won't be sorry you did. I am hooked on this show.
B00594XOZU|4.0|This is a good app but only apple devices can change the settings like the color of the speech bubbles
B006A819AG|4.0|Many of the Roots longtime fans haven't appreciated the direction they've headed in since &#34;How I Got Over,&#34; but I'm one of them.  They display their incredible musicianship on this album, and I appreciate the maturity they've been able to display on this album.  Black Thought always comes correct, and this album is no different.
B007712XAU|5.0|I had somehow missed this phenomenonal show when it began and knew the third season was approaching, so I ordered this set to get caught up.  Wow!  I was caught up in the first fifteen minutes and ended up watching both seasons in one week!  My husband happened to sit down during one of the programs in the second seasons and he got so interested we started from the beginning, so I saw both of them twice and loved every minute.  Such great acting and story telling.  I'd recommend this to anyone who loves British programming, or just good performances.  It's a jewel!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|as titled, I use this app daily. it's clear, easy &amp; auto-snycs.  what more could you want?<br />I use it for shopping lists and brilliant ideas that I would otherwise scribble on a napkin and the lose...
B00A757EFW|3.0|game is ok, but it is the game hessitates and there is a lag of control. decent for free though
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Addictive! Love every season of the show. I wish there were more epoisodes to watch. Every character is well casted.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I loved having this on my Kindle but I was running out of room. Since I didn't use this much I removed it. If you want something like this though it is a good one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A friend told me about and I have not stopped playing all week. Easy to Play. More dynamic version of Temple Run.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Games like this don't normally have a story to them but it is a nice addition. It is great for wasting some time when you have that need.
B000FVE3BG|1.0|This watch looks cheap, feels cheep.  The main steam feels like it is going to fall off.  The gold looks cheep, the hands are made out of stamped thin sheet metal.  I have an other Invicta watch that I like, this one looks like I bought it out of the back of a van.  They do not even compare.  I was very disappointed and have sent the watch back.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I might be completely addicted to Pinterest. This App makes it quite handy on your Kindle so if you have a Pinterest account then you need this App.<br /><br />If you don't have Pinterest then stop wasting your time reading this and go sign up.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was as good as the first.  I can't wait to read the conclusion. The only downside for me was the ending.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It's a typical type of game and I got bored with it quickly. It's good for a download to play a bit though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love it, the game is simple to play and yet exciting. The challenges and daily bonus keeps my kids playing the game to reach the goal. Love it!
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is a great album. Usually I'm not too big of a fan of rap, but this is something special. Some songs will get stuck in your head all day and make you smile, while others will send shivers down your spine with their beauty and though. I highly recommend this album to all my friends.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is beautifully made and the characters are so easy to fall in love with. It is a show I am not ashamed to watch. There are way to many prime time shows today that are far from family friendly and this isn't one of them. I hope you enjoy it as much as my family has.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This app is so addicting. I just got it and I can't stop playing it.  Get this app I am 99.9% sure u will luv it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is pretty cool. I've. just started but so far its awesome. one thing I've found is there are some pretty crazy colors. and styles. its so not natural. I've competed in horse shows all my life and we would have laughed a rider right out of the competition if they would have showed up in hot pink clown outfits or punk style hair do's. I wish there were different breeds to choose from. quarter horses are not the only breed in this world.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I believe it was on the funniest book's I have ever read, I can't wait to read the next book.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This book was great for putting alot of things I feel and experience as an introvert into words. I learned alot about myself, especially pertaining to the workplace situations. I like that the author didn't bash extroverts, and points out situations where they flourish and are quite necessary.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I love my white noise machine at home, so glad this is free!  Looks good so far, but I don't see an option to turn off the vibration.  Also, wish you could quiet notifications but not calls (just in case), then it'd be a solid 5*
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Cassandra Clare is an excellent writer with a vivid imagination. The world that she creates in this series is just sophisticated enough for a late-20 something but not so sophisticated that a mother of two small children doesn't have time to dive right in. I've read this series no less than 4 times and every time I find some new reason to love it. Especially now that the prequel series, The Infernal Devices, is in full swing. The two series together make for an amazing combination.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I've always loved the game Pac-man and playing it on my Kindle is definitely fun (considering that there aren't that many arcades around anymore). What I don't like about it is the way you move Pac-man. For me, it's just difficult to control the little thing at the bottom and I am always constantly getting hit by the ghosts. I'm not sure if I just need to get used to it, or if it's just not designed well. All-in-all I'm pleased that I bought it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved this book...it was an easy read and was disappointed when it finished as I was becoming quite enthrall ed with the story.
B007DA2FHG|5.0|War Horse is a great movie and well worth your time to view as soon as you possibly can.  RJM

B000JQUHLM|4.0|I enjoyed the tale. But then, I enjoyed the original book too, as well as the movie. And it's free.

B00AVIMB1W|3.0|Mohammed Ali is the greatest boxer of all time! His come-back in Zaire I watched on Maui with some friends after returning from Thailand.I'll never forget those times...
B008I34ZFW|5.0|this was the most fun i've had watching a movie in a really long time. I was doubled over laughing more often than not. The jokes are hysterical and are more than just cheap shock jokes, several are funny at face value and then are funnier the more you think about it. this movie is a one liner machine.<br /><br />the plot line is great, Nazis from the moon are trying to take over Earth and for a little while get used for President Sarah Palin's campaign and then there's an epic space battle and more stuff happens and it's all fantastic and fun.<br /><br />if you hated this movie then it's probably your fault for watching it in the first place.If you read the back and still expected it to be a really high quality and meaningful film then no one can help you.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Pompey Hill Rd party of the year award in the first time since the beginning of English language that is not responsible for all your favorite music and the first time since the beginning of the year
B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|I loved this movie and only expected it to be good for background noise while cleaning the house. I ended up after about ten minutes sitting down and watching the entire thing. It's subtle and legitimate, feeling almost retro to back when movies were great. There's no gore, no CGI effects and no nudity because it's not needed to make a great horror flick.<br /><br />The story is about two people who are forced to work overnight at an Inn that's closing soon after 100 years of business and is rumored to be haunted. They spend the night dealing with tenants and overall boredom whilst performing a very amateur ghost hunt. It's cute and quirky but has some very suspenseful scenes as well a few startling ones.<br /><br />One thing that really stood out to me, besides the incredible acting, is how real the dialogue is. The only cheesy lines you hear are ones that you would probably say yourself in the situation and everything else feels very relaxed and like real conversation. The two leads are a perfect match and are both top shelf in their acting abilities.<br /><br />The Innkeepers isn't terrifying and won't make you jump out of your skin that much but it's solid in both story work and in simplicity. I can easily say this will be listed in one of my top ten horror films. Highly recommend.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|Very easy read - holds my interest. Well written and ordered so as to make sense but not boring.  Recommend it highly!
B0094OLFUW|5.0|One of the best albums I have ever purchased. This album introduced me to this incredible band. I look forward to their future stuff.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|The options for sounds are plentiful and (in my fee seconds of listening to them) seem well done and useful. The clock is alright - the font isn't as sharp as if could be, but the swipe gestures are cool. Nice job.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|easy to learn fun to play and cheaper than the real thing good graphics and noises its worth a shot and you might enjoy it
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|There was nothing about this movie that my husband and I liked.  Bad acting for a great actor.  Hopefully Matthew McConaughey does a better film than this.
B002M9WW30|5.0|If you dont know Stallone by now, get this set, Then buy his Rambo set. These are the movies that really made him. IF you like boxing or military movies ;) but even if you dont, but want to &#34;try&#34; something, for around 20 bucks, you can get this set.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love how it is relatable. If you are an outcast you can relate two Charlie. Also how Bill had him read books where the main character of that book had the same feelings as him, like The Catcher in the Rye which I read over the summer.
B004T5K3OK|4.0|Just got my new phone galaxy s 3 But It won't enhance my pictures and create file.  Image is not saved neither ..it's not working?
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is a great book because it was the last time I read a great book because it was very awesome.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Good game fun and ...fun if you like construction and building stuff especially in survival mode it's a great game that's worth 6.99  all of it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good. You should do another one called the forth wheel. And so on and so on. So yea. Thanks for these books to share to the world. P.S. can you call me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I first that this game was boring but when I played it I enjoyed it a WHOLE LOT  and I kept play playing and playing.if you are reading this get the game!! It's free!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I like the book it explains in specific details needed to understand what's going on. It had fun reading this book.
B003Z4DBHM|2.0|I was actually laughing at the melodramatic 4th episode.  Recognizing that this sort of story may have been dramatic, tragic, and moving during its time, it is just silly now.  The costumes and settings were beautiful and seemed representational of the times, and I enjoyed the country scenery.  However, all through the story I kept asking myself \\"Why doesn't...\\" or \\"How come [this]. . .\\"  I just couldn't suspend my disbelief.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Gives a great view of the days outlook and provides a wonderful view over the coming days. Only thing I would add would be a 'snapshot' of the local radar on a map.
B009AMANH4|4.0|The acting in this movie was superb.  The main characters, certainly, but many of the actors with minor roles were just so interesting to watch.  I'm not into period pieces generally, but I really enjoyed getting swept up in 1800's Civil War USA.  Daniel Day Lewis must have met Lincoln face to face at some point since he emulates him so well.  The way he stoops when he's standing and his voice are just so clear to our vision of what Lincoln may have been like.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to follow the storyline as well as I would have liked.  Falling asleep doesn't help (through no fault of the movie itself).  Yet the premise basic premise is very singular in its approach.  Something I would have liked to have seen is more of the actual slavery that was the central subject of the movie.  In a movie of this length, it could have had more screen time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love the mini games and graphics. there are coolitems tobuyand youcan earn money easier on this game the most
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I've seen this movie twice, and the second time was just as exciting as the first.  You really feel the tension in the situations that arise throughout the movie.  The intensity starts from the very beginning when the embassy is being invaded and the Americans are rushing to figure out what to do.  It's not always edge of your seat action, but there is plenty.  The angle from the CIA scenes are pretty interesting in that they seem so out of touch about what would work to free the six Americans.  Ben Affleck plays it cool most of the time and truly believes in the zany story of pretending they are a film crew from Canada.  Some of the things that happened on the Iranian side were improbable in my opinion, yet it certainly added to the suspense of having to get the Americans out of there before it was too late.  Victor Garber played the Canadian ambassador full of graciousness.  It was a suitable aspect of the story to have such a calm character in the whole thing.  I definitely recommend Argo.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such a overturned and could not stop reading.. now on to the third book! Don't want the series to end!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|A movie fun for kids and interesting for adults. The suggestion of sex, no actual sex, predominates in this movie. The visiting space captain is in love with the scientist's daughter, but the father/scientist is also in love with his own daughter, though he is not aware of it. At a subliminal level, the father is in control of this really great computer made monster, though he only realizes he controls it at the end of the movie. So this movie is fun for kids and fun for adults, but at two different levels.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book shows you how resilient a child is and how a person can changes and shape a child forever.<br /><br />I hope she writes another book about Sky and Holder and what happens in the future.
B00005TQKQ|4.0|It seemed to work fine on cleaning the heads on my camera although I did have to use it several times before the tape would play without any lines going through it. I was able to view my old 8mm video's from 20 some years ago on my video camera that I taped them on. So I was happy with this purchase.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|A very good combination of science and theology based on personal experience that allows us to make the connection that we hoped existed.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love this game, can't stop playing. I only gave it 4 stars however, because the 5X5, 6X6 levels are too easy. And, it you need more hints (on the 9x9 and higher levels) you have to pay $0.99 for them. Of course, that has forced me to figure them out by myself. Ha!<br />I definitely recommend this game!
B008Y78M60|5.0|I personally enjoy learning more about our nation's history.  I don't have a lot of knowledge regarding this event...John Wilkes Booth, Ford's theater, House of ill repute across the way, that is about it.  I either hadn't known or had forgotten about many people being targeted that night.  I found this story to be enlightening and yet appalling at how deftly our freedoms can be usurped.  It is an old story, but yet, I can see similarities in some of our more recent history.  This movie informs, moves and warns us.  This movie shocks and surprises. I highly recommend it.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The covering for the silence switch does not function at all on either iphones tested. Since my daughter is a doctor, her phone needs to be on vibrate most of the time anyway so, since she doesnt have the time to return it she is settling with an inferior product.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|All members of my family enjoy this game.  As the levels advance it can be a real challenge to clear the board.
1457514508|4.0|The novel begins with a very intriguing chapter, a prologue, which is a great hook. Without spoilers, some unknown person is about to do something, well, pretty nasty to someone else. Then the book takes off and the characters of Carla and Cindy are particularly amusing as they both plot to become attached to the neighborhood's latest widower, even before the sad event, the death of one of the club members, has taken place. The book goes on to describe more characters that live around the park where everyone walks the dog, and they are all interesting, all well-described and all different, such that it was easy to remember a fairly large cast.<br /><br />About half-way through, I became annoyed at the coincidences --- until I realized, it is a satire. It's meant to be exactly the way it is, so I read on, comfortable that the author knew exactly what he was doing. The author has woven a complex mix of characters who are either on the side of the hated or the hating. Nothing is as it seems. Everyone has a secret. It shifts from person to person, and no one in Gordonston has all the facts, only a subset.  It's comedy at its darkest, and most complex.<br /><br />This was a very enjoyable read. I couldn't wait to get back to it, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a tongue-in-cheek mystery, which could be called a bit bizarre, not the usual, but something quite unique. Someone should tell Woody Allen about this book.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a digital copy of this book as a gift from the author.

0061433063|4.0|The Tiffany Aching series was recommended to me by some female friends, who read it an enjoyed it a good deal, and I've read it and enjoyed it as well.  Reading along as Tiffany grows up has been a pleasure and a joy, and her adventures with the Nac Mac Feegle (\\"Wee Free Men\\") have given me many hours of good clean fun.<br /><br />In this book an ancient priest of the Omnian religion, now a ghost, was awakened from death by Tiffany's dealing with the Wintersmith (in the 3rd novel of the series).  He is a hateful ghost, full of malice toward witches, and he is able to influence people against witches just be brushing against them.  Time after time he attacks Tiffany, turning individuals and crowds against her, while her witch friends (including Eskarina Smith, from the very first book in the witches series, Equal Rites) seek to help her fight him off.  As the game of cat-and-mouse goes on and on, Tiffany comes to slowly understand the priest's weakness and formulates a plan against him.  She will require the help of the Nac Mac Feegle to stand him down for good, as she is watched by the senior witches, who want to see how she deals with this evil character.<br /><br />This book is darker than most of Pratchett's work, but it's a good time watching Tiffany and the Feegles come up with a plan against The Cunning Man, as he is called.  There are plenty of minor cameos and sub-plots going on as well, which makes this an engaging and lively read.  My one complaint is that after building up The Cunning Man to be a truly formidable force, Pratchett has the senior witches arrive and throw Tiffany their moral support, which to me undermines her independence.  This is a minor complaint, and it was quite satisfying to see Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg once more, along with Mrs. Proust of the Boffo joke shop.  An entertaining and enjoyable read, I hope you enjoy it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I cant believe they would put a app like this on here don't you would think it would be a dollar or something it is amazing I rate this app 5 stars it deserves it
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly was a show that my friend had recommended to me awhile back and I figured, why not, let me give it a shot. Well, it turned out to be one of my favorite shows of all time. With great characters, interesting setting, and witty dialogue, I had fallen in love with the show. It is just unfortunate that the show was canceled along with the fact that the episodes were aired in the wrong order. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this show to anyone who loves sci-fi and Joss Whedon. You will not regret it. Oh, and also buy the movie Serenity which finalizes this great series.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Bought this for my husband. He loved it. It has a decent storyline and kept my attention even though its not my kind of movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the highlights of my week.  It is so refreshing to watch a show with no violence or foul language.  The story is captivating and the characters played perfectly by the great cast.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Great job The challenge of the writing captures the chasm between the thinking of the main players at a time of crisis.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really liie this game. Easy to understand and very entertaining. The only problem I had with it is that sometimes it wouldn't load up on my Fire so I had to turn it off and back on again.<br />It works rather smoothly, though.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Awesome story<br />I read it in 2days it was a cant set it down, page turner.  Wow! Cant wait to read more.

B005LAII1C|2.0|If you enjoy Pot this movie is for you! If you don't enjoy pot this movie is not for you. Boring, slow, and I had a very hard time finishing this movie. Ted sounds to much like family guy and I had a hard time getting over that too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is a fabulous author and in my opinion this is one of his best books. It was happy,sad and very intense at times. I really felt like I knew the characters, I cried, laughed, and screamed...I cried like a baby.. Just an amazing book. You did it, Nicholas Sparks, gave me my favorite book so far of 2013!!! AMAZING ending!!!!
B005LAII3A|5.0|it was full of action from beginning to end got to tell all my friends..suspensful had me to the edge of my seat..

B007MLDC2I|4.0|this is a good movie and really shine light on some areas of life that people shy away from, while it is movie I could see this happening.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this when I was eight and I still love it. yet I'm eleven now. I would definetely recommend it to kids
B009IEXKXI|3.0|I like the details of how he did what he did and the why.  But it was much too slow.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Not a bad follow up but thought the ending felt a bit rushed.  Really enjoy the characters though and still excited about next one!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I'm enjoying this game. I just feel bad whenever my egg hatches and the baby leaves and I don't have enough spend to send out a search party...<br />Tyrasade
1419705849|5.0|Bought for my son and as usual, the series delivered. He enjoyed it very much. Looking forward to the next.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I am a Harry Potter fan. With this film I have completed my collection. Love the whole set. Real Neat.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I felt  &#34;War Horse&#34; was outstanding because its unique first person narrative captured the many underappreciated traits of the genus equine that has served humanity so well over the centuries: courage, loyalty ,steadfastness and yes, love,<br />all given without question often to those who don't understand or appreciate them.  To those who do this book has had great appeal.  It is not surprising that it has been read by so many young people, much like &#34;My Friend Flicka &#34; ,Will James'  books, and &#34;Black Beauty&#34; have and it is too bad it is thought of as a children's book, for horse lovers of all ages should read it.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|What can I say. I am a Harry Potter fan. With the purchase of this film and the Deathly Hollows 1 and 2 my collection is complete. Fun.
B000V8A95C|5.0|*Wicked\\" is a great Broadway musical with great songs about Oz. I enjoy this soundtrack, almost as much as I did the theater prodiction.
B00003CXBK|3.0|Interesting, but not up to the quality that I expect from Studio Ghibli. The story was the weak part of this film.
0062060562|4.0|Christine wakes up every single day not knowing where she is nor who the man lying beside her is. Neither does she know why she is much older than she remembers being.<br /><br />Everyday her husband needs to introduce himself and explain to her that she is 47 years old, that she's had an accident many years ago, an accident that causes daily memory losses. She can maintain new memories for only 24 hours. As soon as she sleeps, it all becomes lost to her. And Christine has to take his word, this stranger man who calls himself her husband, for it.<br /><br />She's impossibly confused, so when a man calls her saying he is her doctor and that they have been meeting for weeks concerning a new treatment for her memory loss, and that she needs to trust him and not tell her husband about it, she's not sure she should trust him. But this man knows to tell her to look into a shoe box hidden inside her closet to find a diary. A diary, he says, she herself has been keeping. A diary that tells very different things from what her husband and, sometimes, even said doctor, tells her.<br /><br />Now Christine has to decide who to believe in. The mysterious doctor? The loving, but confusing husband? Or the woman who writes in her diary everyday? Can she believe in all she has been writing? Who can you trust in when you can't even trust yourself?<br /><br />I was so caught up in reading this book that my whole afternoon just flew by. It was like I blinked and the 384 pages were over.<br /><br />Christine was felt scared, confused, mad, distrustful, aroused, guilty, anxious, in pain... and I felt all those things right along with her.<br /><br />I can't very well explain how... how... SATISFIED and GLAD and FURIOUS and INDIGNANT I was when it finally hit me. (I can't say what it is that 'hit me', otherwise the mystery will no longer be a mystery. But I CAN say it was awesome).<br /><br />It's not that the ending was especially creative or unexpected or anything (and can anything even really be 100% creative nowadays?). It was just very well-thought-of. And simply splendidly delivered. (I'm all adjective and adverb-y today. Must be Dash's fault. ;P).<br /><br />The whole book was super intense and intriguing. Staggering. Startling. And... okay, enough with the adjective attack. If you didn't get it by now... then don't even bother reading. No,  no. Read it anyway. It's that good.<br /><br />And there you have it. It's the (almost) perfect love crime. Go read it. Right now.really be 100% creative nowadays?). It was just very well-thought-of. And simply splendidly delivered. (I'm all adjective and adverb-y today. Must be Dash's fault. ;P).<br /><br />The whole book was super intense and intriguing. Staggering. Startling. And... okay, enough with the adjective attack. If you didn't get it by now... then don't even bother reading. No,  no. Read it anyway. It's that good.<br /><br />And there you have it.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|This film and two that I have purchased now complete my Harry Potter collection. I am a Harry Potter fan.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved the story. I fell in love with the characters instantly. Mira did a wonderful job. Can't wait for another.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|a wonderful story with winning performances. especially Judi Dench and Maggie Smith...Colorful and creative story in an unusual setting...try it you will be won over...
B008Q09K2U|2.0|The best part is the description of Yemen historically and politically. Helps understand the present situation there. Also very good the drone experience. Otherwise John Corey was much more fun as a NYPD detective than the anti-terrorist post 9/11 -war on terror guy he has become.Although I found some of the previous pieces about his character much more apealing. I think that the feline saga is being taken too far.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I COULD JUST SIT AND PLAY ALL DAY LONG I LOVE GETTING PRIZES AND THE PUZZLES PIECES SO I DON'T HAVE TO BUY COINS
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was so easy to read.<br />I felt part of the story and couldn't wait to see<br />what happened next. I read it in one evening.
B00ADYYY50|5.0|I love ever song on it except the song with Akon and the love song other than that I recommend this album.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I have known guys like Bourdaine.  In fact, I have lived the life of a kitchen birch and called  even the most socially clumsy and disgustingly nasty my  compatriots .  This book was a great walk down memory lane!
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|This long awaited reunion of the greatest band ever should merit 7 stars out of 5. Unfortunately there is 1 major flaw - the audio quality of the recording. The audio sounds overall distant & mingled. I feel like I'm listening to this great concert from the back end of a huge stadium, the notes fail to hit my senses clearly. Audio separation is poor, & it is difficult to seperate the vocal & guitar notes from the background bass & drum. It is such a pity, because the music itself is phenomenal. Robert Plant achieved at least 80% of his vocal prowess from his haydays, & Jimmy Page is still the guitar god.<br />Interestingly, I burned on the same CD for my car this recording + &#34;Dazed & Confused&#34; from Govt Mule's &#34;Mullenium&#34; album. While Warren Haynes is not quite the quitar God Jimmy Page is; & his vocal does not compare with Robert Plant, I find the Govt Mule version more enjoyable to listen to. This is simply because on the Govt Mule recording, every note is clearly separated, like you are standing in the front of the arena. This difference is inexcusable - Led's recording should benefit from 2007 technology versus the 2000 technology of Govt Mule's recording, not the other way round.<br />If only the audio was better - although I still cannot stop listening to Celebration Day again & again .
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Great read!!  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a good romance, with some exciting twists.  I'm definitely going to read Colleen Hoover's other books!!!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Absolutely love it!! very pleased with this purchase, Will watch it aigain and aigain. A jewel and definetely a keeper. .
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. It is fast, fun and exciting. I would recommend this to my friends and family to play.
140053271X|5.0|I've used the Nook Touch and the Kindle Touch/Kindle Paperwhite extensively and the Nook is the best. Why? I'm convinced that if anyone prefers the Kindle its because they've never tried the Nook. Or they have friends that used Kindle and don't want to venture out on their own.<br /><br />First the Nook feels better. It has a soft plastic outside with a curved back that makes holding the device quite pleasant. It has just enough area around the screen that you can hold easily without mistakenly turning pages. And the side page turn buttons are deep enough you won't turn pages by accident. Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.<br /><br />Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.<br /><br />Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from. Plus the size options all make sense. For instance on the Kindle the couple smallest font sizes are so small I can't see why anyone would use them and to me it's a waste.<br /><br />Fourth the buttons are all well placed.<br /><br />Fifth there are no ads and you can even upload your own pictures.<br /><br />Go try one today. I'm fairly confident you'll love it.....unless you don't.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It' s okay. Not as much fun as I thought it would be. It is a bit confusing on how to get more coins
B002KSPKRS|5.0|This is a great product the price blew best buy out of the water!  Its likw having surround sound in ur head, crisp and clear and the mic kicks butt too I highly recommend this to any gamer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Slow to start, but then it took right off. I found it very hard to put down once it got rolling.
B007WQYH4K|5.0|This album is a must own version from the movie.  The movie itself is interesting and entertaining but the music makes the movie.  For Morricone fans, this album is a must have for your collection.  Don't let the written language titles deter you, once the music starts, you will remember where in the film the music was made for.
B001MTENOC|3.0|Okay...this is too detailed and specific to be believable...since when hypnotherapy became a proven scientific method?  To me, they are just illusions/delusions/lies to make money off selling books.
0316023744|5.0|I have found  this to be one of the best books on World War II that I have read in over 50 years of reading and study.
B00005JNQS|5.0|My kids love this movie. We previously owned this and they watched it so many times over the years it has become so scratched it wasn't view-able so we ordered a new one and all is well again! Cute Movie!
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|It's free but it's not a good game. Don't  get it.  The only thing good about it is that it's free.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Fantastic book!  I read it to help me make more sense of the movie, which I've seen several times.  It did that and much more.  The writing is clear and imaginative.  It brings back all of the sense of joyous awe that I've experienced since childhood when I started reading astronomy books and watching the beginning of the Space Age.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|I have been waiting<br />While for this its exactly what I expected very good film<br />What you would expect at race day!!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark Places was suggested this month in my book club. From beginning to end I was sucked in trying to figure out where the story was going to end up. Several times I thought 'I know who it was!' but then a new twist would put a spin on the story. The plot was a great one, the characters (though not people I would personally relate to) were believably damaged. The end was satisfying...what happened? I hate reviews with spoilers, so if you want to know how the story unfolds - buy the book. My only complaint is that the eBook version is ridiculously expensive - not much less than the print. I ordered the print copy and I'm glad I have a new book by an Author I will now follow, on my shelf. :)
076531178X|5.0|This purchase is actually to replace my copy which I loaned to a friend and never got back (long story).  It's a fantastic book, well worth reading again.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|When I read parts of this book before I sleep, I am left to go to bed and wake up without all of the drama that has built up inside and out.  It is a simple book and really does help put things into perspective.  A great reminder on how to live a life full of love.
0765325950|5.0|A MEMORY OF LIGHT may not please every critical reader of the Wheel of Time series, but it certainly did me!  As a writer myself, I was wondering how Brandon Sanderson would be able to bring it all together at the end of a 14 book series, but he did.  Brandon kept the scenes and characters moving toward their destiny without causing us to forget just who we were reading about.  In earlier books Robert would occasionally cause me to forget previous characters because his scenes about specific characters were so long.<br />The characters in each of the books are so well developed that we find ourselves personally identifying with one or more of them.  As a female, I am delighted to see so many strong females in key roles.<br />None of us wanted any of our favorite characters to die, but someone had to during such an epic adventure.  His choices of who to keep and who to kill off, seemed logical to me and perhaps many were Robert Jordan's choices, since he left extensive notes on how the series was to end.<br />Spiritually, this series is a microcosm of life on this planet and the growth of human consciousness on many levels, as one travels through life.  This entire story and the characters might easily be seriously studied by students of human behavior and those interested in learning how the God Force or Spirit works in our lives, weaving us together into one large tapestry of unity and oneness.  There are no accidents and one must eventually learn to go with the flow of things instead of trying to control that which has a greater destiny.<br />Bottom line... I LOVE THE WHEEL OF TIME SERIES.  I have read the entire series twice and plan to purchase more hardback copies until I own the entire set.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED READING.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I'm hooked ! A friend from work knew with me retiring I would need something to do & she was right! I love it!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I thought the book was okey, because I have read the whole series. But to be onest the plot was erratic and seemed to me, written with a \\"hurried\\" feel.<br />But i don't regret buying and reading it either because I like Pendergast
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app. Right when I got my kindle fire, I downloaded this app first. Th  game is super addicting and fun to play. Once  you get this free app, you will never be able to put your tablet or phone down. Get this app right away if you don't already have it! Don't stay reading this app, get it! NOW
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I hesitated to purchase this game but so glad I did. A little disappointed to find out I had to purchase the sequel but I was hooked after the first few minutes so I had to get the rest.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Even though it's an early teen book this is one of the most captivating stories I've had the pleasure of reading and this latest one was amazing. Definitely worth reading.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|GREAT. I thought of the George Bush presidency and how much of a mess we've gotten into  playing world police. Maybe if we acted like these puppets and blew up everything in sight everyone would like us.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|MY GRANDSON LOVES TRAINS AND LOVES THIS MOVIE.  HE LOVES WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  A REAL CLASSIC.  WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is great I love it very much it's high quality allows you to have more interesting feelings for the game and makes you want to play it more and more. It's not as great all the pc but for a handheld game it has a lot to offer I recommend it for all you fans.

B009CGYO0K|5.0|This book is absolutely hysterical I was laughing and keeping my parents up for awhile the only con that is no problem at all is there is the use of d@'m no problem unless you are like 3 I recommend this book to anyone who is older than 3.

B003YFJ5U4|5.0|The reason I call it Chocolate for the intellect is that I have read many books and journal articles on Quantum Physics over the years (and have always found both the subject and history fascinating). But this book brings a whole new dimension to the topic. So no matter how much I've read or understand about these ideas, Kumar has assembled both public records and private correspondence to paint a picture of the development of the ideas and the personalities of the scientists that turn it into a tour de force of genius. He brings these scientists to life as real people whose life histories and fortuitous events played a role in how and when they had the brilliant insights that led to a revolution in how we understand reality. So no matter that some of the stories and events are familiar to me. So is chocolate. But I keep enjoying it each time.

B009I2UH2W|3.0|This charger works and fits my iPhone 5.  But as others have noted, if you use this at night the bright white circle light on the end of the plug is distracting. They should have made the color blue or just used a small single light to indicate it's working. I wonder what the designer of this charger was thinking.  I will probable put some tape over most of the light. Charges the phone quickly. UPDATE: I ordered a second charger for my wife's iPhone 5 and she pointed out to me that there is rubber cap on the end of the charger that fits over the end and covers the bright white light....she's pretty too! So I'm upgrading my review to 5 stars.<br />UPDATE:  March 2016:  After 2 years and 1 month this charger has stopped working, not sure I will buy this same charger to replace this one that now does not work
B004SUDPWI|4.0|While not as grand as 'Lawrence of Arabia' in its depiction, it is definitely among David Lean's best movies.  Lean takes enough time developing the characters and plot, and presents a very satisfying movie  with (what's most amazing to me in most of Lean's movies)  a grand climax achieved with precision but without the use of CGI.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|If you like the show glee, then this is going to be a perfect it for you.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of glee, so i found this movie completely boring and predictable. I wouldn't recommend it.

B006O2QNOU|1.0|I have never in my life seen so many commercials before a movie.  Total greed.<br /><br />Now that the movie has started maybe I can figure out how to turn off the subtitles.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game, it's super addictive and entertaining. Especially when you trade off turns with a friend or family member to see who gets the highest score. Still trying to beat my brother-in-law's...<br /><br />Either way, the game is fantastic in any mode and I'm certain you'll enjoy it if you challenge yourself. The only thing I'd like to change about it is the whole 'Sensei's Swag' title, which annoys me. Sensei is great, yes, but honestly the whole 'swag' thing is just irritating.<br /><br />It's nothing more than just slicing fruit, to be honest, but the challenges and the opponents you make of your friends and family is what really makes it worthwhile.
0143115014|5.0|If you think you know perfume, you don't until you read this book.  It is written by one of the foremost scent scientists of the last 20 years, Luca Turin and his friend Tania Sanchez.  They know the science of perfume and they love its artistry.  You will enjoy every minute of this book and it will empower you to go on scent journeys of your own, experimenting with fragrance.  It will truly broaden your horizons.
B00A2H9NZY|5.0|This movie gives the life of the best surfer in the world (Jay Moriarity). He is rescued by his mentor Frosty and Frosty agrees to teach him how to survive Mavericks, he learns strategies to help him stay alive while surfing the giant wave. Mavericks is a wave Half Moon Bay, California and it only breaks with the perfect weather conditions. It stays dormant about 360 days a year, but when the conditions are perfect, the big reef at the floor unleashes monster waves. As a 12 year old surf girl, I knew this movie was an absolute must see. I dragged my mom and sis into the theater with me. My mom loved it and so did my sister. I connected so well with that movie and I really did look up to Jay Moriarity. He was the main reason why I started surfing. I told my mom I wanted to be juat like him. R.I.P Jay Moriarity. We all love tou. Love, your fans in Florida! LIVE LIKE JAY
B000FBFN0Q|2.0|I don't know what I was expecting, but it was more than this book delivered.  It was boring, stupid and pretty mindless.  I can't imagine anyone being as dumb as the heroine of this book.  could not finish it.

B000KFB4PK|5.0|My granddaughter loves it. She chose it and gives it five stars. Me, Grandpa is happy because she is happy. Hopefully we will get it together before she grows up. I know it will be worth the five stars shortly. It is an excellent gift especially for a gifted engineering child.lol

B004I2K4E8|5.0|I really love Les Mis, have seen the play twice and the movie; but this production was awesome due to the high caliber of the singers and the huge choruses: fabulous in surround sound! I thought I'd watch a few minutes, but ended up seeing the whole show (and lost a couple of hours of sleep that nignt!). Highly recommended.

B0099Y2YL6|2.0|I was so looking forward to Season 3 of Downton Abbey. I thought Season 1 was wonderful and Season 2 was almost as good. So I waited for season 3 with baited breath, waiting to see what would happen to all my favorite characters. The first 2 episodes were great and the season seemed off to a promising start. Episodes 3 & 4 were good, though I thought that 4 was a little shaky plot wise. Episode 5 started out well and ended in being heartbreaking in the extreme, from there on out it was all downhill. By the time I finished watching the Christmas episode I was completely disillusioned. Gone was everything I had loved about the show.<br />Originally Fellows said that Downton would only be 3 seasons and I wish that he had kept it that way because I think we would have gotten a FAR different story line. He let himself be talked out of his original plan, a plan that I suspect was fairly well thought out to begin with, and the resulting confusion and incoherency shows. This season was completely disjointed story wise, some plot lines were carried on infinitely longer than they needed to be (to the point where I was literally sick to death of them) and some were dropped before they were really even developed (the money \\"issues\\" being a prime example of this). There were even times when Fellows seemed have forgotten his own writing, apparently contradicting information he had given us in past seasons. But the worst was that the characters have morphed in ways that make them almost unrecognizable. I think if Season 1 Branson could see the Branson from the end of Season 3 or the Christmas special he'd drive the Crawley Renault right off a cliff. Perhaps Fellows was too busy working on his miniseries about the Titanic to truly care what was going on with Downton Abbey and since he has 2 more projects in the pipeline it seems unlikely that will change anytime in the near future. I am really left feeling that Fellows now views Downton as the cash cow to be used to finance his other projects and that is the saddest thing of all.<br />The only reason I am giving Season 3 two stars is because the actors are still amazing and the costumes and locations continue to be gorgeous. Sadly neither of these makes me want to watch forthcoming seasons. So season 3 marks the end of my love affair with new episodes of this once great program though I will continue to cherish my copies of Seasons 1 & 2.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|get it, it's lots of fun and it's a great sequel to an addictive game. have fun playing temple run 2.
1423140605|4.0|I purchased for my nephew for Christmas.  He is into this series of books and was happy to<br />find the latest on Amazon.  I purchase all my books for my niece and nephews through<br />Amazon.  Great prices, shipping, etc.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book along with the other books in the series are beautifully written and very entertaining. This book was very exciting
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put my book down!<br />You can relate to Ana and wish for Christian. Ana is such fun character and love how she analyzes Christian.
031603441X|5.0|There'e alot more to Keith Richards than most of us realize, like that he is more responsible for the writing of most-and close to all-of the songs that we know the Rolling Stones for than he has gotten credit for and that gets realized by most people. Also, what a crazy life. Still in the process of reading this, but what I've read, I really like...
B00021HBGS|5.0|3 year old child really loves these.  They stick well, are very affordable and are fun.  Nice item for child.
B000B8I8X2|5.0|This is what my boyfriend wanted for Christmas...He says its amazing...and he's happy with it...and I think it's also pretttyyyyy awesome!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is sick. I made the right choice in getting it. You should really get this awesome free game. Oh and did I mention there is just one giant demon monkey.
B000LPS4BQ|5.0|My 4 year old loves Scooby Doo and she really likes this version made with real people. I also do not mind watching this movie with her.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It's an interesting story from a medical standpoint, and opens up ideas on the universe and spirituality. I found it very positve.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I don't usually read this genre, but this book hooked me and carried me through the fantasy quite nicely.  Yes, it may be written for a much younger audience, but I found it fun.<br />Development of characters was lacking, but the plot carried it well.  I am not going to give spoilers, so, I will say the time travel is handled much differently than I have seen before.  Jacob, the protagonist, becomes a different person due to time travel and perhaps that was the point.<br />I would encourage people to read this, especially adolescents and young adults, but I will also tell a few 40 -somethings that I enjoyed this book, too.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|I always loved HBO TV series, but this one i, I can tell, the best. If you loved Sopranos, what are you waiting for? get this one!!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|This app is a great sleep aid. The noises are comforting. The loops are a bit short which can be a bit grating on the nerves but you get used to the sounds after a while. Great app, I think it is priced accordingly.  Thanks for giving me the opportunity to review this item. I have several people I am going to recombinant this app to.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is awesome because I have always wanted a horse and now it is like I have my own horse.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Got this movie in 2 or 3 days. It is in excellent condition. Thank you so much :) Amazing service.
1451695195|4.0|We are all on a journey from the womb to the tomb, but none of use know what is after that?  No one has really come back from death. There are individuals who have experience near death experiences but you often wonder they really experience a trip or imagined the whole thing.<br />In Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife, Dr. Eben Alexander claims to have made the passage, or at least get to the outer rings of the transition. What makes this book fascinating is that it is written by a scientist who before his experience did not have much of a spiritual belief system.  However, once he got back, he became a believer and now is on a quest to share his story.<br />The book also delves into Eben's own insecurities and the internal struggles that have consumed so much of his life.  It is a quick read and gives the reader one man's odyssey as he literally came back from the dead.
B001FAFO3W|5.0|Loved this movie since I was a kid. Got it in about 2 days and it is in great condition.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really didn't like either main character - too self centered and either unwilling or too lazy to work on the relationship.  Kind of a &#34;war of the Roses&#34; feeling.
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|This book is actually a few short stories. The first ones are great but the very last one is boring. Overall a great book, though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Yet another wonderful book in the trilogy! Cannot wait to get started on the final book! Suzanne Collins is a genius!
B000001FN8|5.0|One of the coolest Scorpions' albums ever! I was a junior in HS when this came out and was already deep into the Scorps. Skipped a varsity baseball game to see them w/VH, Metallica, Dokken and Kingdom Come at Arrowhead Stadium in KC. Coach was not happy. 1988, I'll never forget it. Savage Amusement Rocks!! They need to remaster it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I somehow came across this in Kindle and I am glad I did. Maybe it was in my Recommendations List.  Anyway, I thought the characters were engrossing and interesting and the plot is fascinating! The series kind of reminds me of The Hunger Games.  Perhaps this will get made into a bunch of blockbuster movies too!  Goodluck to Howie.  Can't wait to read the rest!
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Couldn't get it to download. I lost my internet connection before download was completed. When I got the connection back it still wouldn't finish downloading. Didn't get to see any of the movie so I can't tell you anything about it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a happy edition to my Kindle Fire games. My only real complaint is that the controls can be a little difficult to navigate sometimes and climbing sometimes was a slight pain because I would constantly fall into the water making a bridge to my house. I love it though and wouls recomend it to anyone.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Never saw the first one so I can't compare them. Thought it was pretty good for what it is, an action flick with a limited script. It served it's purpose for me. Killed an hour and a half of a two hour flight.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I really do like this app, I just noticed some things I thought could be better. First of all, I also have this on my smart phone and it works great, but the one I downloaded for my Kindle won't let me connect my account, even after I change my password. This is really annoying to me because it limits what I can do with this app on my Kindle. If they could fix that bug, I may give higher kuddoes
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The only thing that is awesome to be able to die in the most common sense of fire up to die us get it to die in the world of fire turned
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game keeps me entertained while on my commute to and from work very day.  It is also very addicting!
B002ZG99G8|5.0|With an amazing cast,especially Jeffrey Dean Morgan,killer action,perfectly times and hilarious jokes and everything else that makes a film worth owning,\\"The Losers\\" is another modern classic that we will not be seeing a sequel to as Hollywood is too busy with complete trash like \\"Avatar\\" and the \\"Twilight\\" franchise. Put this next to \\"RED\\" and \\"The Expendibles I & II\\"! I wish there was more talent and less \\"suits\\" in Hollywood!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My 4 year-old grandson absolutely loves it!  He plays it every time he visits me and it keeps him entertained!
B005LAIHSG|1.0|This film is so dreadful that I cannot even find the words (w/o getting tossed off amazon). No story,worst acting. This is why Hollywood has no clue. This film is as bad as \\"Avatar\\", and that is saying a lot! Kristen Stewart had better start thinking about saving her career. Kristen was excellent in \\"The Runaways\\", so we know she can act. But, after being in many of the worst and most successful films (Twilight Franchise and This THING), I think I have made my point. Hollywood is clueless and sadly is the audience. This film is for a blind 3 year old child.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really helps pass the time away when I'm sitting around.  The game functions well and is a lot of fun.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Great action and storyline twist! Didnt like the ending as this is a must continuation of this series. Nuff Said
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome I love horses and now I get to care for one on my kindle its so great.
B005LAII62|5.0|My wife and I don't watch many animated films now that our kids have been launched.  But this one caught our attention and we watched it and are glad we did.  The story line was fantastical, but the film used those unusual props to reveal human character and the film made both of us cry at times.  The animation was stop action, which made the characters appear very lifelike in terms of facial expressions, unlike most computer graphics.  And it was a lot of fun.  It would be a great family movie, although I don't recommend watching it with very young children, say under 10 as parts of it are too scary for minds that can't readily distinguish fantasy from reality.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Original story for a change - very interesting characters and plot. Special effects are very good - certainly keep you interested.
B00138CYD4|5.0|This really is the best Santana album I've heard. The songs are great, they never fail to put me in a good mood when I listen.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I play a lot of games. I mean A LOT, I've been collecting my entire life and have a personal collection well over the ten-thousand mark and enjoy games all over the spectrum. Nothing absolutely nothing comes close to the raw emotional power this game (Journey) summoned from me. I felt a sense of wonder that's been void since my childhood and emotions I won't even try to put into words. I traveled with another on a trek across deserts dunes and ruined civilizations to the mountain irradiating a beam of light into the sky. It was short, concise, to the point and packed more emotionally provoking content than any other game I've played in my life. It's a magical and mystic experience. I won't go to far into detail as I don't want to flesh the game out too much. Bit of advice - turn the lights off, make sure no one disturbs you for a couple of hours and just play. It speaks for itself. Thank you, thatgamecompany, you have a new fan. I will be purchasing your next game instantly.
B009HSVHV2|5.0|Another great album from Kiss. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he's still rocking out. :)
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Love this! Great for make sure u don't lose it. Good for when the baby starts to grab for things.
0142407380|5.0|Ark Angel is the only book in the Alex Rider series that I have ever read. One reason I really liked it was that you don't need to read all of the previous books to understand this one. Reading the other ones would probably give you better background on certain characters but none of them play a big enough part in this book for them to completely confuse. Ark Angel starts out exciting. The very first chapter has the reader captivated by Alex Rider and Horowitz does a good job creating characters. Sometimes his descriptions are vaguer than in other parts but he gives enough description for the reader to not have to wonder what the heck is going on. His detail when describing places, like the football (soccer) stadium is excellent and one can almost feel as if they are there watching the exciting game and can just see the excited and disappointed fans. The book is action packed all the way through and Horowitz never fails to surprise the reader with something new that a character says or reveals. I guarantee that once you pick this book up it will be seemingly impossible for you to put down.
B00932A6G4|5.0|i have loved all of the starship trooper movies because I think that all of the different bugs and the flying machines are so cool
B0091REZMW|3.0|Doesn't give very clear instruction about what gremlins and such have to do with anything. Have no idea what the coins are good for at all.
0316227706|5.0|While I generally do not purchase picture books, I found the unique subject matter (dogs photographed underwater) quite alluring and decided to buy a copy of UNDERWATER DOGS ... now, I can't put it down.<br /><br />Seth Casteel has put together a fascinating and revealing portfolio of photographs of dogs at play ... underwater.  The head-on/in-your-face pictures are quite amazing and they certainly elicit a wide range of reactions.  Casteel offers a different perspective of how seriously and aggressively dogs approach the simple task of playing fetch.  Wide-eyed, wide-mouthed and baring some wicked teeth, many of the dogs come across as furry sharks, sea-monsters or even aliens when shown underwater ... much different than the happy little fuzz ball flopped-out on your floor.  The book certainly delivers on the author's desire to reveal the wolf-roots of the domesticated dog. Adding to the book's appeal, Casteel doesn't settle on presenting readers a predictable portfolio of \\"water-dogs\\" (Retrievers)... Bulldogs, Dachshunds and even a Chihuahua are among those breeds represented.  The best part of UNDERWATER DOGS, however, is the final chapter that has out-of-the-water \\"mug-shots\\" of all the dogs photographed throughout the book ... talk about Jekyll and Hyde.<br /><br />UNDERWATER DOGS is a great book that will surely generate smiles, chuckles and quite a few \\"OMGs!\\";  A must-have for dog lovers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game.  Its as realistic as I have seen in a long time.  I just started playing it tonight and I already love it.  Would love to see buying horses and making money a little easier in The game though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am so excited! As I was checking The Free App Of The Day, I saw the Featured New Releases and I always look through those and I saw Temple Run 2, and quickly pressed the image to download! I didn't even need to read the discription! Awesome! :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well written and great story line, really enjoy the intrigue and sub plots.  It's also fun to see the actors in the show that are familiar.
0547848412|4.0|Life of Pi boasts a very strong and beautiful storytelling. I am so fixated in reading it that I am done within several days. At the end I had to google it to find out more about Pi, which I thought to be a real life person, and was dumbfounded when the work is fully fiction. Yann Martel has successfully brought to life his story and the world inside the book.
B0000029AP|5.0|This is my favorite Aerosmith album.  A true classic!  This is a must have for any fan of Aerosmith.  This one never goes out of style.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I love the anti virus scanner, I have the computer version and when I saw this I had to get it. I have no worries that it won't catch any bugs.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I saw the movie in the theater and liked it, so I wanted to get the DVD to see if there were any extras ( like director commentary, deleted scenes, etc).
B009MCRHH6|4.0|This is a great app and very addictive. This app really can be a challenge on levels which makes it more fun, the graphics are great for a simple game and very well thought out. A MUST BUY APP!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|My husband and I started watching Game of Thrones on HBO and love it!  We can not wait for the third (?) season to begin.  I wanted to get the first book to see how close the show is to the book.  I love it!  Shortly after purchasing book one I received an email listing the five book series all rolled into one.  So, I had to purchase that too.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Great app does everything the web version does, but on mobile, haven't had problems with it yet. A MUST GET APP FOR TWITTER USERS.
B004SUDQ8Q|3.0|The movie Rabbit Proof Fence is a gut-wrenching true story, based on the book by Doris Pilkington. It chronicles the journey of two sisters and one cousin's escape from Moore River Orphanage in order to reunite with their family and heritage. In the early 1930s, Australian government thought it necessary to uproot \\"half-caste\\" children (children who were born to a white and aboriginal parent) from the only home, family and culture they knew in order to have them conform to the traditional practices of the Christian philosophy--to save them from their selves.<br />Placed in charge of this process was Mr. A. O. Neville, the Australian Chief Protector of the Aboriginal people. Mr., Neville saw two classes of people, full blooded aborigines, who needed to be segregated from society and the \\"half-caste\\", which needed to be assimilated into society by breeding the lighter skinned aborigines or making them domestic servants.<br />The focal point of the movie is on the three girls Molly, Gracie, and Daisy who have been seized from their small village, Jinalong, and relocated to Moore River Orphanage in order begin their training--to learn Christianity and become purposeful members of Australian society. It is here where their journey home begins as they escape from the orphanage and begin a journey over one-thousand miles to rejoin their mother. They have an overpowering resolve to stay true to their culture and get back home. The girls' determination enables them to out fox an experienced tracker, a native aboriginal man as well as the local constable.<br />Along their way, the three girls are helped by some of the community but it is Molly's strength and remembrance of the eagle protecting her (a story her mother had told her before they went hunting for dinner one day) that led her and her sister back home. It is this same resolve that carried Molly and her sister throughout the rest of their life as they were still being hunted for integration to Western culture.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great addicting app, it does have some glitches that mess the game up when playing. But this app is a must get.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great little solitaire app,  easy to setup your way. Fun play anywhere while your waiting. Love the game board choices.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great weather app, does everything you need in a weather app. It's a must get app for checking the weather.
B009SJ46EA|5.0|I absolutely LOVE AHS!! I don't have cable so one day at Walmart I bought season one so I had something to watch on the weekend. I'd heard a couple people talk about the show and wanted to see it for myself. I watched the entire season in one day! I couldn't go to bed until the last episode, and was sad when it was over! I was so happy when I found out that there was a 2nd season, but disappointed when I found out it was a completely different story line. When I found season two on Amazon, I was excited to see what I've been missing this season.<br /><br />Even though I still love season one more, I love the actors and how by using them in different characters, they did tie the two seasons together. I love Jessica Lange, and Evan Peters. To me them two make the show. And Dylan McDermont(sp)plays a creepy guy really well. In season one, there was something sad about Tate. Like he was missing something in his life when he was alive and he found it in Violet. I felt happy for him that he found her. And I had the same sympathy for him as Kit in season two. Jessica Lange is an amazing bit**, but I love how both seasons her character had a vulnerable side.<br /><br />Only bad thing I can say about season 2 is that I don't care for the alien story line. I CAN'T wait for season 3!!!
0765325950|4.0|When Robert Jordan passed away after book 11 of the series, I had feared that we would never reach the day that we knew what happened at the Last Battle. Thankfully, Brandon Sanderson devoted the last several years to finishing the story that Robert started.<br /><br />Anyhow, I've known many people who enjoyed the series up until about book 7 and gave up. I, for one, actually have enjoyed each of the books, even if they weren't all that great at progressing the story, so this review is coming from someone who was chomping at the bit to get this book and was easily able to forgive the imperfections of the series up until this point.<br /><br />I won't go into details for those wishing to avoid spoilers, but overall, the Last Battle lived up to it's moniker. Battles in multiple places, characters trying to keep other characters alive to help win, Forsaken getting their comeuppance, and revelations. Some characters died that I expected, and there were some that were out of the blue, while one was even a horse, which is the one that evoked the most emotion for me.<br /><br />Minor spoiler, the ending was a little anti-climatic, sort of. I get the philosophy behind it, and knowing what the characters did, I would have probably made the same decision. Though, for anyone who wasn't expecting it on some level, well, there were multiple instances where the series referred to \\"in an age long past, or an age yet to come\\", so it really shouldn't have surprised anyone.<br /><br />Anyhow, I started reading the series on the recommendation of a buddy of mine back in high school in the mid-90's (probably 1995), and the 18 years since the series has keep me waiting for more. Now that it's ended, I'm a bit disappointed, but I am so excited that I got to read the ending that Jordan envisioned for the series and am extremely glad I experienced it.<br /><br />As to some of the minor issues... Several times during certain sequences, they'd hint at something that was about to happen, then switch over to another sequence of events. Then, when they went to the first sequence, they would continue, but the thing that they hinted was about to happen, didn't, and they hinted again that it was about to be resolved. When you read it, you'll know what I mean with the Horn and the Seals.... In a way, I think that disjointed the story a little. Perrin's escapades I feel could have been condensed a bit. As could several of the other character arcs. But, those two things were fairly minor to my ADHD mind, and I was able to feel some closure at the very end. Theories that fans had were either confirmed or debunked, the Last Battle ended, and we got a glimpse of the beginnings of \\"happily ever after\\" that were possible.<br /><br />Thanks Brandon, for completing the series that I had never thought I'd read the end of. You made this fan glad that he stuck with it until the end!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|enjoyed the game not as difficult as I would have liked. hope to see a little more excitement in the sequel.
B001VLXNO2|5.0|A very credible blend of fact and story telling, congratulations Jeffrey Archer.<br />Whether Mallory was the first to climb Everest is not as important as the man behind the myth.

B0095VP8D4|5.0|After only a day of completing my computer build, the processor has been great, and does what it's asked. With EVGA GTX 580 GPU, the system plays games excellent, and doesn't seem to get too warm. The CPU fan is a little small, so I will probably end up getting a slight upgrade before I overclock, but otherwise, it works great.<br /><br />Will edit if necessary.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book held my attention the entire time. I thought the concept was different and fresh. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves thinking outside the box!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Thank you it helped. Me get a boy for the first time. This gives good info for people that are shy.
B00B3Q86LK|5.0|Having watched the entire available series I have to say that Downton Abbey is quite the most engaging bit of story we've seen in many a year. Fantasitc stories, exceptional acting and such wit!! Bravo, Bravo!!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I found it disappointing as the storyline was very weak. It was good erotic fiction but definitely not deserving of all the hype.
B0089IGUKO|5.0|Personally I have never heard of these people, but my husband and son are tickled.  Our son tamps down his jealousy knowing that &#34;someday&#34; he will inherit.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This story was very well written, and the accents of humor definitely aided in the overall quality of it. Mira has a knack for getting  into her character's heads and conveying their thoughts very well.

0812550706|5.0|By Jacob<br />1/11/13<br /><br />Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is the first of five books.  Ender's Game is about a boy named Ender Wiggin, he is the youngest in the family.  Set on a futuristic Earth, parents can only have two children, a boy and a girl.  Ender's family was being tested, by the International Fleet to see if any of their children could be used to defeat an alien species referred to as the buggers.  The buggers tried to invade the Earth two times before, but the humans drove them back.  The human race needed to prepare more soldiers before the third invasion occurred.  Ender's parents already had two children not suitable for battle school, so the International Fleet allowed the parents a third and final child, that's how Ender got his name.  They found Ender suitable for their battle school, under the watch of Colonel Graff.  He went to the battle school orbiting Earth to become a solider.  Training involved battle simulations and video game playing to prepare for the third invasion of the buggers.  Ender was highly skilled and was the best in the battle school despite being very young.  Was Ender good enough to save the Earth from being wiped out by the buggers?<br /> Ender's Game is one of the best books I have ever read because it was very exciting and the author's writing makes you feel like you are part of the action.  It was very clearly pictured in my mind.  The author also had very clear and powerful details of how the characters acted at powerful moments in the story.  Here is a quote of when Ender is switching armies and won't be in Alai's army any more.  \\"Alai suddenly kissed Ender on the cheek and whispered in his ear, \\"Salaam.\\"  Then, red-faced, he turned away and walked to his own bed at the back of the barracks. Ender guessed that the kiss and the word were somehow forbidden. A suppressed religion, perhaps. Or maybe the word had some private and powerful meaning for Alai alone. Whatever it meant to Alai, Ender knew that it was sacred; that he had uncovered himself for Ender, as once Ender's mother had done, when he was very young, before they put the monitor in his neck, and she had put her hands on his head when she thought he was asleep, and prayed over him.\\"  Right away I felt the deep emotion that Ender and Alai were feeling during that moment.  It was very brave of Alai to kiss Ender.  I understood why Alai was brave because he kissed Ender and then spoke a word in a forbidden language.  I also understood Ender's confusion of why Alai did that because Ender is so young.<br /> I gave Ender's Game five stars out of five stars, because it was amazing.  The description of the characters and setting in the story were great.  I loved how Orson Scott Card described the future Earth.  For example, today students have computers and in the Author's future Ender had an electronic desk that you create images of 3-D mountains on.  He also had huge spaceships that could fly all the way to another solar system with men in them, while we have space ships that can only fly to the moon with men.<br />  Compared to Divergent by Veronica Roth Ender's Game is better.  Divergent, also about the future, was not as good because it wasn't how I would have pictured our future.  In Divergent the future Earth society is bleak and there is hunger and homelessness.  Also in the society described in Divergent, people had to choose one of five ways to live, and if you failed the test to be in one of those five ways, you became homeless.  In Ender's Game there is advanced technology and spaceships that go to other solar systems.  The books are alike because they are both about futuristic worlds of Earth.  I liked Ender's Game better because there was more advanced technology and everyone worked together.  In Divergent humans fight other humans, but in Ender's Game humans all work as one to fight aliens.  Although Divergent is good I would recommend Ender's Game to anyone who loves futuristic books and needs an amazing book to read.
1119962846|5.0|Well written book that covered the important aspects of R programming without getting overly complicated. I would recommend it to anyone that is new to R.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|it is addicting! and i haven`t even started to try to get three stars yet. i very rarelyhave any glitches.
B00AY9RV90|4.0|Typical New Order, Nice to hear Hookys input to the Music.  Just hope they can work out their differences and make some more great music.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Instead of using a virtual joystick this game uses two arrows on the edge of the screen for left and right. On the right side the arrow is behind the tab to open the menu for the Kindle, on the left side the arrow is unobstructed but still only responds half the time. The jump, brake, and item buttons are lined along the bottom making the two arrows more cumbersome to use since you pretty much have to use your fingers instead of thumbs if you want to reach everything.<br /><br />Besides control, the tracks are empty and the music loops at an irritating pace.<br /><br />I remember a great Pac-Man Rally game on PS2/PSP.....this isn't it.
B008HK3XU4|2.0|it is not what i thought it would be not crazy about it but stuck with it now...that is it
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I wish I could remove my name from twitter. I don't like it and since I signed up I've gotten a constant stream of new web sites.  I remove one and another pops up.  Coincident? Maybe.  Iwont reccommend
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Gift for granddaughter. She's enjoying it with us and her mom who also loved Annie when she was a little girl.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|easy to play kids like it fun to be involved has some issues with starting over at certain levels good overall for a free game
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A no brainer! (If you get my drift.) This read is good for the soul. Enjoy and tell your friends.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Has everything a coming of age story should and then gives a whole lot more. Grips you from the get go and doesn't let got until the end. A must read!
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|My two year old loves this, the fact that all the vehicles make sounds is awesome. He is really excited with it
B004LROUW2|4.0|longer is not always better, but this is mature murakami and if you like the author, worth reading (the chapters are well spaced and short, so it is not that daunting once you start the book)
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Always have liked taylor swift. This is another great cd. Definately you need to get this cd if you are a taylor fan.
B00867GK26|4.0|I would definitely buy from them again. I had a problem and they helped fix it. This is what I call great customer service. When they say guarantee they mean it.
B007HO392S|4.0|Great cd. I would recomend to anybody who loves country music and carrie underwood. Good product for the amount of money.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love the variety of background sounds and that I can use the same app for my alarm clock. Good choice!
B002SQNM9A|5.0|A great cd. Realy gets you in the holiday spirit. I think there is 6 or so songs on the cd and I think it is worth it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Post apocalyptic but has a good plot. Interesting characters. Perhaps where we're headed in the future but maybe not so contained. I felt it was worth my time and money.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I used it on my Ka-Bar Becker BK2, but I don't think, its so much effective in that. Anyways its ok
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I read it but it wasn't one of my favorite John Grisham books!<br />I thought there were way too many characters to keep track of.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Sometimes I will complete a drawing and send it, and the other person never receives it.  When I go back to the game, it is as if I still need to draw and send, and I have a do a whole new pic.  Neither I nor the other player ever receive notifications that it is our turn.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Garth Stein does a wonderful job of bring his readers into the lives of Enzo and Denny without going overboard.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|ive been waiting for this to come out for a long time and now its here. This is actually a really good game for the fire. It runs smoothly
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is a great book and I don't even normally read books that aren't a steady romance. But this book I just couldn't put down. What keeps you enticed is dying to find out if Pat ever finds his silver lining. Some parts mad me so very mad but others had me laughing hysterically. I just wanted to jump in the book and hug Pat a few times and smack him too! This is a great read.
B006UUK612|5.0|I had seen this before, and I wanted to give my children a chance to see it.  They loved it.  A fun, feel-good movie.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This was a great buy! The dvd is perfect and the whole set up it came in is beautiful. I would recomend this to anyone. It is a steal!! I love it. Would never expect something so nice for the price
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|This is a frustrating game...and it comes with no instruction ...you have to keep learning by trial and error.  Not nearly as much fun as Angry Birds.
B002VHI8HC|5.0|Extremely witty and frighteningly relatable. An easy but absorbing read that I couldn't put down. I wish I had heard of it before I watched the TV Series, but still enjoyed it thoroughly. I would recommend it to anyone who has seen the TV series, or anyone who is fascinated by psychology. 5 stars. Margaret?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Pretty fun game :) If you really have nothing to do, it's a good game to waste some time on.

B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have been using this for a little over a  week now and I love it. I prefer it over eBay's mobile site. I still like using the actual site on my computer for selling, but buying and bidding using this app is seemless and satisfying.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|This microphone does make your personal audio needs better but it has a few drawbacks.<br />1. the cord is very long.  You'll need to fasten the section that's not used or it'll become tangled very quickly.<br />2. the clip is flimsy and doesn't stay in place.<br />3. the on and off switch is harder to access because the main body might become loose at the connections.<br /><br />My next microphone purchase will definitely be a wireless one.
B0058YPL66|4.0|Now, I have only watched 2 episodes on Netflix so far and it is not too bad.  Good idea... interesting enough....  The acting at times is a bit over the top and not necessarily intentionally funny yet my husband and I have chuckled at some of the characters in their attempt to be dire and serious especially in the alternate fairy tale world.  I was not familiar with many of the actors except maybe Jennifer Morrison.  Not totally blown over by the show just yet but will most likely keep watching just out of blatant curiosity.  It is actually a good idea for a show so I am very much hoping it gets better as the show progresses.  I'll give it only 3 stars, so far, as the acting is just a tad overdramatic at times!  _____Update:  Only have the last episode to view on Netflix!  I really like the costumes on the show, especially when they go to the fairy tale world.  They are so elaborate at times! The show did grow on me a bit after about half way through the show and trying to figure out who is who in the real world which was interesting.  Every one in town has a parallel identity in both worlds except only a very few know in the real world who they are in the fairy tale world.  Every one else is walking around with some amnesia due to the curse carried over from the fairy tale world.  As the show progresses Henry starts to tell certain people who they really are but mostly it is met with disbelief or shrugged off because he is a kid heavily into a book he carries around with him frequently on fairy tales.  Needless to say, Henry has to spend a great deal of time convincing the town folk with not alot of success at times!  As I said at the beginning, some of the acting can be a bit overwrought and overacted at times and yet there are shows that every one is acting with the right balance of emotions!  If you can get past that and some dubious scenes then you should have no problem getting thru, with some enjoyment, to the end of the season.  It is a good idea for a showand not every show is going to be A+ entertainment but that is predictable with most every show out there.  There is at times a few 'clunker episodes' to deal with but all in all the show is entertaining and mildly amusing...  The show is one that you just have to keep watching because it gets its hooks into you.  BEAUTIFUL COSTUMES AND SET DESIGNS ARE SO WORTH WATCHING!!!  CGI looks good in the show as well as some of the buildings, castles, landscapes, etc.... are done that way.  So after watching the whole season I will give it another star and make it 4 stars.  Suprisingly entertaining and the show just gets better as you progress...  Hope that helps!
B0060AY6FO|3.0|The mystery writer who created Adam Dagleish and is now in her 90's has written a sequel to Pride and Prejudice with a murder in it.  The story is logical and fun at times.  James shows how an author would have a terrible time writing a novel about all that had previously occurred; she also has Harriet Smith from Emma adopt a loose baby.  However, Darcy and Elizabeth are not portrayed as the flesh and blood people we know from the original by Austen.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Though a Cinderella story, Drew Barrymore does a terrific job with this role. It has a sense of fun, laughter, sorrow and joy to it. Anjelica Houston does a good job of playing the obnoxious stepmother and you cannot help but have a bad taste in your mouth towards her. If you have not seen this movie yet it is definitely worth it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This novel concerns the death of a local British politician in a small English town and the ramifications of that death among various dwellers of that town.  The problem with this kind of a subject is that many characters are focused upon.  Therefore, the dilemma for the author is how to differentiate those characters for the reader so the latter is not confused.  Happily, Rowling is up to the task; characters are clearly defined in personal characteristics, speech, and thoughts.  Rowlings successfully depicts small town British life with both its inhabitants' concerns and clashes while bringing the town of Pagford itself to life.
1457514508|4.0|Suburbia's Heidi, Cindy, Carla, and the recently deceased Thelma made up the original dog walking ladies club. It wasn't long before Thelma's husband, Elliot was the dazzle in their eyes. All of the characters including their neighbors are very entertaining and have plenty of their own skeletons in their closets. Talk about adventure, gossip and drama!<br /><br />On their daily walks at the Gordonston park you'll find in-depth descriptions of the dogs and their behavior. A true dog lovers read!<br /><br />Now, imagine a \\"poopa scoopa\\" tool becoming an issue. A contract killing occuring with three more planned and no one is safe. Any one of these scheming individuals could have had a hand in it. There are many twists and turns to keep you turning the pages.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to facilitate my review. No other compensation was received. The opinions expressed above are my own.
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|Well-balanced, well-produced, well-performed album that needs be heard.<br />Keep rockin' guys!  The world needs more real music that has something to say.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I chose this rating because, very simply, I loved this book.  I couldn't put my kindle down!!! I'm not much of a reader, and I read it in 3 days.
0812993357|2.0|Like everyone else who saw The September Issue, and fell in love with Grace Coddington as a result, this book might come as a shock -- not because of the secrets revealed, but because the book is completely bland, boring and poorly written.<br /><br />Also, there are no dishy secrets, revelations or captivating stories, sadly. A few pages devoted to Madonna being difficult -- really? a surprise to anyone on earth? -- does not a memoir make.<br /><br />2 stars for the pretty cover -- which really is striking.<br /><br />Also, I still think Grace Coddington is awesome, this tragic book notwithstanding.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I got a message that said I had won 500 games a few days ago--addictive! Works great, and haven't had any issues at all with it.
B006IYG5HE|3.0|Nesbo and Hole... Not so much... Probably won't finish the series, not sure why these novels are so popular. I give it a 'meh', not thumbs up, not thumbs down...

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book took me by surprise.  The author brings you into the story and holds you there through the entire story.  It was beautifully written.  Great book; just great.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Keeps you guessing.  I really enjoyed this book.  Twists and turns with every chapter.  I would recommend to anyone wanting a good book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I would have to say I couldn't have completed this game with the help of the \\"hint\\" button. It  was spooky and not my game of choice ( but I have played most hidden objects games you have) and thought this would be a challenge....and it was. Great graphics and sound. I do want to do the sequel so I guess I am not as afraid as I was before playing this. Happy playing.....<br />TO BE HONEST, IT STATED IF YOU LEFT FEEDBACK YOU COULD GET A CONCLUSION TO THIS, SO THAT IS WHY I LEFT THE FEEDBACK.  GOTTA TELL YOU THE CONCLUSION WAS AWESOME.  SO GLAD I DID IT!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and I'm completely addicted.  The only down side is there isnt much to really purchase with the coins you earn but other than that its an A+.  Graphics are great and it runs smooth.
