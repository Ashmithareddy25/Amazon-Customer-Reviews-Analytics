B0000C7PSW|4.0|The problem with Want One isn't so much it's flaws as the strengths of it's predecessors. Rufus's self titled effort and Poses (the latter especially) were full of a cheeky, wry brilliance, cleverly articulated and expressed over a poperatic blend of piano ballads and more sprightly jams. Thus, the bar was set high, and Want One, while engaging in it's own right falls a bit short, at least based on my initial listens.<br />The musical style hasn't changed drastically. This is still a fundamentally Rufus Wainwright album. However, the focus seems to have shifted more towards the pop aspect of Rufus's sound. This works pretty well sometimes (Beautiful Child especially, IMO). There are a few little explorative tinges - the chaotic keyboard dominance of Vicious World or the synth on Movies of Myself, for example, that mostly add something to the record's sound. Yet still, there's a lack of anything as melodically powerful as, say Poses's title track and Barcelona, or as outrightly groovy as Shadows and Matinee Idol. Basically this time out is a much denser affair than before, which takes away from it's accessability, if not it's overall quality (that remains to be seen as time passes).<br />But if the album suffers anywhere, it's with the lyrics. They're not bad by a long shot. However, nor are they as good as we know Mr Wainwright is capable of. Previous lyrics were tightly crafted and fully loaded, creating a resonance with each line. The lyrics on Want One seem a little more shallow, I suppose. Pop cultural references are more direct (as opposted to being hinted at) and abundant than before. Song concepts are simpler and easier answers are offered about life and love. It's hard to provide specific examples, but a lyric like &quot;My phone's on vibrate for you / but still I never feel from you / Pinocchio's now a boy who wants to turn back into a toy&quot; lacks the punch of something like &quot;I went from wanting to be someone / now I'm drunk and wearing flip flopson Fifth Avenue.&quot;<br />The lyrics are also a little harder to make out here. Maybe it's a production issue, maybe Rufus is just slurring more than usual, I'm not sure. I mean, let's face it, the man would sound good singing the menu at McDonalds, but there is a bit of a drop in clarity and therefore quality.<br />Apparently this album is the first of a duo that came out of the same sessions. I can't say for sure without hearing the other, but maybe he would've benefitted from distilling them down to one CD. <br />Reading over it, this review sounds alarmingly negative. I want to reiterate that Want One is by NO means a bad album. It deserves all of the 4 stars I'm giving it (Well, I'd give it 3.5 if I could, but it's closer to 4 than 3). It may not be Rufus at his best, but it's certianly a lot better than a significant portion of the stuff that's out there this year.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM! As a Bowie fan I have been a little disappointed with his later albums - even Heathen had a whole air of depression about it - but this his latest offering, is upbeat, classy, and shows Bowie still has the artistic creativity he has shown through his career, and more importantly, here he pulls if off with great effect. A must for any Bowie fan!
0345423496|2.0|This book starts out badly, and then gets worse. Clarke, not content to rest on his laurels after completing his original 2001 trilogy, decided to make a great leap forward a full 1,000 years to show us his vision of what our human society would look like at the start of the Fourth Millennium. This he does by resurrecting astronaut Frank Poole, previously notable mainly for being HAL 9000's first victim, after he'd been found adrift in deep space, and then plopping him right smack in the world of 3001 and letting us see it through Poole's eyes. This is, at best, the stuff of cheap pulp science fiction, and a man of Clarke's scientific knowledge should have been embarrassed to use it as a key plot device. This is, after all, the man who gave us the notion of putting astronauts in hibernation for long duration space flight, an idea that, though technically challenging, at least sounded reasonably plausible. In contrast, re-animating a corpse that's been dead for a thousand years is just absurd. <br />Anyway, it starts from there, and quickly heads downhill. A common critique of science fiction is that it's often heavy on the science and light on the fiction. Putting aside Poole's magical, er, `revival', the rest of the science is quite good. And it is also the only part of the book that is genuinely imaginative and interesting. Clarke's 3001 does sound eminently plausible, there have been great strides in space travel, for instance, and yet there's still been no star voyages, no discovery of \\"hyper drive\\" or \\"warp drive\\", for instance. But once he veers away from his vision of futuristic science and technology, the train starts to leave the rails. There is little sense that people had advanced artistically, culturally, morally, spiritually or in any other way besides technologically. True, there's less crime, for example, but that's only because every person is outfitted with an electronic device that plugs directly into their brain, thus allowing potential criminalsand other forms of deviancy to be monitored and dealt with. As a result of developments such as these, future life is generally safe, healthy, and pleasurable, but also generally bland and seemingly lacking in any higher sense of purpose. It is, not coincidentally, also lacking in religious faith and values, which also makes for the most controversial (and, in my opinion, poorly handled) part of the book.<br />Clarke isn't exactly subtle in his views on the subject. Early on, Poole finds that whenever he utters the word \\"God\\", even as a mere figure of speech, people react as if he's just used a dirty word. It seems in the future, religion, while apparently not outright illegal, appears to be strongly discouraged. Clarke dredges up the usual arguments, most notably the case of the Inquisition, to try to portray all religion as a sham at best, and a form of insanity at worst, but ultimately they fall flat. This is probably due to the fact that Clarke seems to have made only the shallowest and most rudimentary efforts to understand the subject of religion, having, for instance, one character pompously proclaim that religion was simply the byproduct of fear, it obviously never occurring to him that it might also be the byproduct of hope, even love. And, finally, it is interesting to note that, while the 2001 series makes for an entertaining creation myth to explain mankind's evolution from ape to thinking human, there's a moral to be derived from the fact that the mysterious monolith brings us only intelligence, but not wisdom or virtue.
0345457684|5.0|This is Morgan's first novel, as far as I am concerned this could have been his one hundreth novel, it is that well done, professional in every detail, from plot and character development to scenery and background discriptions, and banter between characters, all superb. There are lots of plausible hard science fiction ideas portrayed here, including the storing of people on data disks, cloning, also it is a time for immortality for those who can afford it, with death just an inconvenience as the deceased  are simply 're-sleeved' into a new body, natural or artificial. Morgan treats all of these ideas with an original twist, none in and of itself is particularly original (is there anything today truly original?). A person's consciousness is located as a back-up in a cortical stack at the base of the brain. Takeshi Kovaks, the primary character, finds himself re-awakened many light-years and time from the planet he was living on prior, where he was violently killed, and Kovaks very quickly becomes immersed in a mystery to be solved.  <br />To me good science fiction presents to the reader a future that is not only possible, but likely. A good writer can write about a future that has undergone a paradigm shift, and values the majority today consider important are no longer valid, and Richard Morgan does just that here in this novel in fine fashion. At 375 pages it appears to be of moderate length, but this is a 'trade' paperback, lots of words on each page, it takes a bit of time to read. The mystery Morgan spins here will keep you guessing, and includes very realistic settings. A word of caution for those who don't like novels with rough edges, there is plenty of violence and sex here, very earthy.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|5 stars because it is STILL Enigma! If you are a true Enigma fan like myself, do not listen to the bad reviewers who are unwilling to accept change. But don't think you won't recognize that this is still the Enigma we know and love. The album does have a very modern feel in places, some classical influence, and that certain magic that is Enigma is always there underlying the entire cd. I personally didn't want another Return to Innocence, I'd rather something new from the artists I enjoy. And by the way, Voyageur is miles above Delerium's Chimera! Michael Cretu is still the king of this genre! Get it Enigma fans, you won't be disappointed.
0609610570|3.0|This was a very good book.  Having a perfect strategy gets you nowhere if you can't execute it.  The authors go through why execution is so important and how to improve your execution.  Concrete ideas in how to do strategy sessions and planning are included.<br />There's a lot of material packed in, so I found it a difficult read.  I'm glad I read it, but I'm also glad I'm done with it.  I expect to get more out of it someday when I read it again.  Don't expect to get through this book in less than 3 weeks.  As good as it is, it's also very tiring to read.
B000002KCC|5.0|This LP has been called an Irish Wake and in many ways it is. Recorded by Young and the remainder of Crazy Horse after the death of guitarist Danny Whitten (heard here on &quot;C'mon Baby Let's Go Downtown&quot;)this is one of the saddest, confused and cathartic records ever released (to me, it's up there with &quot;There's A Riot Goin' On&quot;) and I feel cleansed after listening to it. Never before has an artist faced death, addiction and self loathing in such a direct, brutal manner, at times almost to the point of embarrassment (notice Neil's voice cracking and the way he slurs most of the words here) but I find it endlessly fascinating! This release and the recent issuance of &quot;On The Beach&quot; on CD are essential additions to any classic rock library.
0380789035|1.0|Yet another work whose premise is great, but is very poorly executed.  This book joins the millions of other failed attempts at something truly good.  Character development is terrible and clumsy.  I could say a lot more, but end the end I would just have to say that I would not recommend this book.
B00005K3LU|5.0|I hadn't watched this movie since seeing it in a real, walk-in theater back in l988. I still remember how electrifying all of this was--and it absolutely galvanized the packed theater, with everyone cheering and whooping and stomping the floor! I watched the DVD version last night and was once more completely hooked. From the first frame to the last, you're galvanized by Bruce Willis like you've never seen him and action and characters who instantly connect. Even the fashion and backdrops that make this an 80s film don't bother you. The characters were delineated so brilliantly that they're timeless. You watch this flick, with 9/11/02 instantly coming to mind and it makes you think of how innocent we all were--when we had villians as simple as Alan Rickman's money-grubbing plan that had nothing to do with terrorism but everything to do with greed.  It makes me think of those fantastic Republic serials of the 40s that were edited for lightning fast pace, with thrills galore!  Even though &quot;Die Hard&quot; has been relentlessly ripped off countless times, Willis and this master crew of action geniuses bring this movie to electrifying life. It's vibrant, visual, dynamic aura makes &quot;Die Hard&quot; a classic that will be watched a century from now, along with similar action classics, like &quot;Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938)and Republic Studio's collection of mythical serial thrillers like &quot;G-Men versus the Black Dragon&quot; and &quot;Daredevils of the Red Circle.&quot;
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Hi out there to all the other Maiden fans! <br />Well, I have to admit that when listening to it for the very first time I was a bit disappointed (although I was desperately trying to deny my feelings being a big Maiden fan for years). But after having listened to it several times I changed my mind. I think it can (nearly) live up to &quot;Brave New World&quot; although the album seen as one unity stops short of being of the same quality as its predecessor. Despite that, songs like &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, &quot;No More Lies&quot;, &quot;Montsegur&quot;, &quot;New Frontier&quot; and the closing balad &quot;Journeyman&quot; certainly make up for the weaker songs. And to be honest: Which other good old metal band can claim to have succeeded in keeping up its style throughout so many years without feeling the need to follow any goddamned trends and therefore betraying their fans (like some other bands did, such as Metal.....:))?<br />All I can say is<br />Up the Irons!
B000089RVR|3.0|OK, I've listened to this cd more tan 12 times by now, so I feel prepared to go ahead and contradict most of the reviewers of this album here on Amazon.<br />Life for rent has some pretty solid songs; White Flag, Life for Rent, Mary's in India, See you when you're 40 and Don't leave home being them. All of them.<br />The rest just comes and goes, not fully developing. Some of them , like Sand in my shoes or Who makes you feel, are promising songs that should have been mixed better. The others (I've not made my mind with Stoned yet) are simply forgettable.<br />On the opposite street from most fans, I think No Angel and Life for Rent have more than we think in common. That's probably half of the problem. The other half of the problem is that at least in the first album the 11 songs sounded finished.<br />The worst part comes from the lyrics: I've read numerous times that the lyrics are ok. OK?! How can you be 30 and have so little to talk about? And how can you express it so plainly? Example: <br />\\"I've always thought <BR>that I would love to live by the sea<BR>To travel the world alone <BR>and live my life more simply<BR>I have no idea what's happened to that dream<BR>Cos there's really nothing left here to stop me<br />It's just a thought, only a thought\\"<br />That is not a thought, and even if it is, a 6 year old develops it more, trust me.<br />I repeat, I REPEAT, you will find good songs in here, but don't expect to find a good album. Dido shows us she is a master at delivering killing tunes but has stumbled in proving what she promised in her first album: being able to create soulfull works.
B000066F6H|5.0|It's good to know that some new bands still believe in taking a direct, honest approach to music making. The raw energy on display here is addictive. Many have lamented the fact that the band didn't write these songs themselves, but the songs wouldn't be nearly as indelible without the stunning performances and enthusiasm. Howlin' Pelle Almqvist is a great lead singer with a true rock n roll voice ( and not just a Jagger imitator as many have said) and if you've ever seen the band live, you know he is an electrifying frontman. My personal faves (&quot;Main Offender&quot; and the dynamic &quot;Hate To Say I Told You So&quot; are reason enough to own this LP. This is real rock. Some people still get it right every once in a while.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I will start of by saying that there are very few CDs out there that I would ever give a 5-star rating.  However, I must say that even without Maynard's stamp on this record, it would still be one of the best CDs ever created.  I find it to be superior to any other CD that Maynard has ever been a part of.  When I first got this CD, I listened to the whole thing 3 times and it blew my mind.  It gave me the same feeling that I got the first few times that I heard The Wall by Pink Floyd.  Though APC is far different from Pink Floyd musically, their art does resemble each other.  I will now say that anyone who criticizes this CD on the sole basis that it does not sound like Tool has surpassed all ignorance and has dived straight into an abyss of stupidity.  Why do you think Maynard would join another band if all he wanted to do was make more Tool albums? Any music fan, even if they are not a Maynard fan, can listen to this CD and see the talent and greatness that has gone into it.  I will not say what my favorite songs on this album are because the reason you are reading this review is either to gain insight because you plan on buying the album, because you want to see what others think of this CD, or because you want to criticize my opinion.  Listen to the CD yourself and determine your own favorite songs.
B00005JG6S|3.0|First released in 1988 to much acclaim, &#34;Akira&#34; is still considered to be a classic among Japanese anime films and might be considered an early example of cyberpunk cinema as well. The film is based on the comic books of the same name by Katsuhiro Otomo, who also directed the film. &#34;Akira&#34; depicts a post-apocalyptic Tokyo of 2019 that is plagued with  riots by day and terrorized by teenaged biker gangs at night. Young Tetsuo (voice of Nozomu Sasaki) is injured in a motorcycle accident and whisked away by military police who have arrived at the scene to collect a mysterious child who seems to have caused the accident. While in custody, Tetsuo becomes the subject of experiments which give him telekinetic powers. The leader of his gang and lifelong best friend, Kaneda (voice of Mitsuo Iwata) wants to rescue Tetsuo. And he is not the only one who wants to break into the  compound where Tetsuo is being held. A group of anti-government activists have their own reasons for seeking the powerful subjects of these human experiments.<br /><br />The animation in &#34;Akira&#34; is spectacular. Some of the scenes are breathtaking. I was especially intrigued by the way that the artists imitated the properties of film with animation: I had never seen selective focus animated before. And I loved the way the taillights of the motorcycles leave light trails at night. If you are a big fan of anime, or would like to see some excellent examples of its potential, &#34;Akira&#34; is a film you must see. Otherwise, I have reservations about recommending it. Adapting the considerable quantity of material in a serial comic book to feature film length is always difficult, but &#34;Akira&#34; does an especially poor job of it. The story is utter chaos. Large parts of it are incoherent. At the film's conclusion, we still have no idea who many of the characters are or why they did what they did, what the film's point was, or if it was supposed to have one. The characters, themselves, are two-dimensional at best. I've seen much more effective characterizations in animated films. And you'll find better writing in most any animated film. So enjoy the animation, but don't expect much from the story. Japanese with English subtitles (a dubbed version is available).wo-dimensional at best.

B000002UZ6|5.0|I love Tina and this collection is very good for either long time fans or newbies.I bought this CD back in '91 when it was released and it has 17 tracks listed and River Deep,Mountain High is NOT one of them.Some of the reviewers list it and mention it but my copy doesn't include it.Weird huh?
B000068IEU|4.0|People are missing the point to this movie as i have read some of the reviews, As with Craven's other film &quot;The hills have eyes&quot; (just came out with a two disc edition from Anchor bay)   This is not about explotation but how we relate as humans to each other when we are faced with in human acts,what will we do to survive and Craven is not afraid to show us what that is, yes it's low budget but i felt like i was watching a documentary  this movie is hard to watch,not for kids, i bought this dvd for the extras commentary by Craven mainly
B00005ASHM|5.0|I really don't mean any disrespect, but if music this beautiful is the result, then more songwriters should suffer nervous breakdowns. Brian Wilson wasn't even 30 years old yet, but had such a grasp on time, maturity, love and mortality that his musings seem like the work of a wise old man. This is not a 'hits' collection or a few key tracks surrounded by filler, but a suite of flawless chamber pop meticulously arranged, composed and performed, but it doesn't feel staged or stiltled, there's a drifting, mellow warmth and intimacy to these proceedings. Of special note are the goosebump inducing harmonies on &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; (the ahhh's at the end get me everytime) and the late Carl Wilson's sublime lead vocal on the classic &quot;God Only Knows&quot; (the lyric..'the world could show nothing to me, so what good would living do me?' is simply heart rending)just a couple of key moments on an LP that will never sound old. Beautiful.
B0000B3FCX|4.0|Now I have to admit I only bought the CD because I saw the Video &quot;Someday&quot; on MTV.  But after hearing the rest of album. DAMN It's good. 10 out of 14 tracks (including Bonus) are good. It has a combo of your hardrock tired of your bull$hit style with a I miss the ya type with out getting to mushy.  They keep their edge. Tracks like &quot;Flat on the Floor&quot;, and &quot;Do This anymore&quot; Are good to listen to is ur pissed at your Mate. Tracks like &quot;Someday&quot; are good for when ya makin up, and the track because of you is good for when ur mate is begging and crawling back to ya. Like I said though it isn't the very best I've heard (it would have gotten 5 stars) But it is a must buy. And for those who only give it like 1 or 2 stars, do urself a favor, STAY OFF THE DRUGS!!!!
B0000542D2|3.0|I hate it when a great movie like this is undermined by a bad dvd production. This really pales in comparison to the Criterion laserdisc !   This dvd picture is darker than it should be, obscuring many details. The sound is tolerable.  If the laserdisc version was remastered in stereo, why wasn't the dvd ? <BR>Many of the extra features are boring , boring &amp; MORE BORING ! <BR>Too many interviews with people marginally connected with the film. Watching these extras, I thought the next interview was going to feature the guy who delivered sandwiches to the film crew !  No movie trailers !!
0671027344|5.0|I'm not quite sure if words can describe it but i am blown away by this book in every aspect. <br />It's amazing.<br />The author mixes humour with sadness and the reality of life out side the comfy suburbs that i live in, where its easy to pretend nothing truly bad is out there.<br />I find it inspirational, and my emotions were keyed in to theprotaganists feeling.  I felt like I was in the book.  As Charlie, the main character's life started getting better I started feeling better, it opened up my perspective and the way i view the world.<br />I would strongly suggest this book to anyone and everyone no matter who they are.<br />I loved it.

B00000AFFI|5.0|This is my favorite PJ Harvey album.  It's simply a masterpiece of subtlety.  And I have to admit, I wasn't that into it the first few times I heard it.  Like I said, it's just incredibly subtle and minimal on the surface but repeated listens reveal a lush, melodic, and cohesive work.  Easily Polly's most melancholy material but also some of her most listener rewarding.  Don't judge this one right away.  Sit with it for a little while and you'll find a fantastic record.
B00005JMCN|4.0|This movie is not as good as the book but it is still a very worthwhile film to see.  It is beautifully filmed and the racing scenes made me a horse racing fan.  I had alway been bored by horse racing on TV and thought I would be by the racing scenes in the film but they were done in such a way that it seemed you were on a horse in the race and really brought home the danger, drama and excitement of the race. <BR>The true story of Seabiscuit has so much heart to it that you can't help but be moved by this movie but the book has so much more heart and soul to it than the film and it gives the complete and accurate story.  Some things in the film were changed a little for dramatic effect.  <BR>This movie is not the great film it could've been but its many good points even out the flaws.  And it is a film for everyone, not just horse lovers.  It is not about horse racing, it is about an amazing, spirited, underdog horse finally meeting people who understood him and allowed him to be his best.<BR>No one will regret giving this film a try.<BR>But read the book and watch the PBS documentary.

0790731002|3.0|Before director Joel Schumacher ruined the Batman film series with 1997's Batman &amp; Robin; he made his Batman directorial debut with Batman Forever.  With original director Tim Burton (who stayed on as producer) gone along with star Michael Keaton, the film allready had a lot going against it, but on it's own it is a solid action comic themed blast.  Val Kilmer plays the caped crusader this time around, and he faces off against the Riddler (Jim Carrey) and Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and eventually teams up with Robin (Chris O' Donnell) while wooing the oh so hot Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman).  Kilmer proves to be a good Batman, but he isn't as convincing as Keaton was.  Carrey is great as the Riddler, and I can't picture anyone else (Robin Williams was originally considered for the part) playing him.  Jones overacts quite a bit as the maniacal Two-Face, and O'Donnell seems a bit wasted as the boy wonder.  The film boasts gorgeous, albeit overdone, set pieces and cinematography, and all together Batman Forever was the last good Batman film before the ludicrous and utterly terrible Batman &amp; Robin.
B000056K04|1.0|This album is terrible. Terible, terrible, terrible. For reasons no one will ever fully understand, DMB frontman Dave Matthews hooked up with producer/song writer Glen Ballard to write and arrange \\"Everyday,\\" which is essentially a Dave Matthews solo record. First problem: As a Dave Matthews solo record, it's slickly over-produced (by Ballard) and fills the \\"void\\" left between Matchbox 20 albums. In other words, it sucks. The lyrics are Matthews-esque, but have Ballard's pop-friendly handwritting all over them. Far be it from me to discurage any artist - successful or otherwise - from taking risks, but this isn't a \\"risk.\\" It's a sell-out move from a man who can do it on his own. Second problem: As a Dave Matthews Band album, which the packaging says it is, reigns in Matthew's incredibly talented band mates, relegating them to studio musicians. Ballard and Matthews wrote and arranged all of the music using keyboards and guitars and then brought in the band to record their parts. No jamming, no band input, and no violin solos from Boyd. For shame, Dave. This is not what people who like DMB like about DMB. It's the exact opposite. Bland, radio-friendly tripe that offers nothing new or interesting. I am not going to argue that Dave was or is a great songwriter, but at least before he wrote his own (sometimes corny) songs. In a just world, this album would de-rail Matthews career and piss off his fan base. Unfortunately, people don't seem to care that much about their music anymore. After all, what's the difference between an artist who writes his own lyrics and one who pays someone to write them for him? Credibility? Artistic integrity? Who cares? Times have changed. Third problem: Dave made the decision to work with Ballard instead of releasing \\"Summer So Far,\\" the album that appeared on the net as the Steve Lillywhite Sessions. That material was eventually released as \\"Busted Stuff,\\" possibly DMB's best record to date. Depressing, yet tinged with hope, the songs thatDave scrapped in favor of \\"Everyday\\" are the antithesis of Ballard's pre-fab pop crap. The meant something. They made you feel something. After listening to \\"Everyday,\\" I felt empty, as if I had lost an hour of my life and I would never get it back. If you have every Dave Matthews Band album, and you need this one to complete your collection, download it. Do not buy this album. Go buy two copies of \\"Busted Stuff\\" instead.
0062502182|5.0|i loved this book. i read it in one sitting. it comes with so many messages that we can apply to our own lives, and is just very, VERY well written. it is inspirational, and really made me think about its messages when i finished with it. it is a fable, so it comes with a moral. it is an easy read, and i recommend this book to ANYONE who is in search of a wonderful, inspirational read. i cannot express enough how much i loved this book.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I love this album, and don't kid yourself, about 50% of it is &quot;electronic&quot; even though it sounds like a wall of guitars. The production here is flawless and the song manage to &quot;ROCK&quot; while still have a sing along tune. Great party music too.<BR>OK, a whole album gets a little tiresome (maybe that is why it is a fairly short album) but clearly this guy in onto something great.<br />Imagine Jim Stienman meets The Who meets metallica...
B0000AXE8I|1.0|I GOT TO ADMIT THAT I WENT TO THE PREMIER OF THIS MOVIE I THINK IT WAS A WEDNESDAY NIGHT AROUND 12:30AM.  THERE WAS SO MUCH HYPE SEEN THE CONTINUATION OF ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIE THAT PUT A LANDMARK OF SPECIAL EFFECTS.  USUALLY, WHEN THERE IS A LOT OF HYPE SOMETHING BAD IS GOING TO HAPPEN.  THE FIRST HOUR IS A WASTE OF TIME, AND I WAS WONDERING HOW CAN THESE PEOPLE RUINED THE LEGACY OF THE FIRST ONE.  THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IN THIS MOVIE WAS THE CAR CHASE SCENE.  I THINK THAT FINDING NEMO HAD MORE SENSE THAT THE MATRIX RELOADED.  I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED: MATRIX THE VIRUS
B0000028M7|5.0|The first time I heard the album \\"Dirt\\", I was 8 years old. And nearly 10 years later, my thoughts on this album have only matured. This album shows me that music was once alive, and don't get me wrong...in some cases it still is. But, on a personal note, I was very appalled at the fact that certain stations (specifically MTV and VH1) did nothing but compare Layne Staley's death with Kurt Cobain's (they both passed away on April 5). And if you've observed the music, Alice in Chains defined Grunge. Nirvana, on the other hand, popularized it. I like Nirvana, but I didn't see MTV playing Alice in Chains' \\"Unplugged\\" 40 times in a row after Layne's death for 6 months.<BR> Anyway, back to the CD, \\"Them Bones\\" was a great track. So were \\"Sickman\\", \\"Junkhead\\", \\"Hate to Feel\\" and \\"Rain When I Die\\" (which makes the title ironic because it was indeed raining here in Chattanooga when I heard the news). The best songs that caught me were \\"Dam That River\\", \\"Down in a Hole\\" \\"Godsmack\\" (no, not after that band), \\"Rooster\\", and \\"Angry Chair\\", and \\"Would?\\". Layne's vocals along with Jeryy Cantel's guitar playing on this album could keep one spellbound. I love this CD and I recommend this CD to anyone that wants thier money's worth.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|This album is probably THE best album since Baduizm and Baduizm live. Every track on the cd is enough to keep you snapping your fingers and singing the chorus as if you wrote it yourself. All of the tracks are ear edible and if I had to pick a favorite it would be a tie between Danger and Woo. Erykah Badu has truly outdone herself and has successfully imprinted her name in the R&amp;B/Neo-soul record books. There's only one question I have to ask...why only 10 tracks? Maybe she's just ear teasing us.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|Brian DePalma's landmark film \\"Scarface\\" has been released in so many formats, it is hard to imagine anyone would want to buy it again, right?  Wrong.  This new DVD is night and day compared to earlier releases of the film in ANY format. This version is crisper, cleaner, clearer, more colorful, vibrant, and far more alive than ANY other presentation of Scarface that has existed before.  Indeed, the box states that it looks better now than it did upon release, boasting \\"better-than-original picture quality\\" and I do believe they were not even taking full bragging rights!  This movie to me was just begging for a good restoration and I'm glad to say it finally got it.  Like the earlier \\"Taxi Driver\\", \\"Scarface\\" has a gritty, dirty, city-wise feel that used to be hard to get through mainly because of hissy sound and a sometimes murky picture.  With today's advances in technology, both these movies have actually trancended their formats, almost making the medium \\"transparent\\".  When you remove the hiss from the sound and then improve the picture and the color, you are left with so much more than just a film---you now have an experience.  <br />I compare this film to Taxi Driver for several reasons. One, Scarface features a young Al Pacino in a very violent, disturbing film, just as the young Robert Deniro's Taxi Driver portrayal. Interestingly, these two early films are among their finest work. Two, both films reached and spoke to a much larger audience than the initial critical and audience reaction would have implied.  Thirdly, these films are two masterpieces that happened to have come out at a time when films were inherently hissy and muted.  We happen to now have the ability to rectify that situation. <br />When Taxi Driver came out on DVD, I was overjoyed to find that they not only included a restored version of the film and an awesome documentary, but also included current interviews with the writer, director, the main actors, including Robert Deniro, and everyoneinvolved.  This edition of Scarface also gives us all that and more.  It interweaves documentary interviews with Al Pacino, Brian DePalma, even the cinematographer, and Oliver Stone, who reveals that to write this film, he had totally immersed himself in the drug world, on both sides of the law, and even felt threatened on several occasions, when he revealed to drug-lords that he had spoken with police captains as well---all of this he then tried to capture in his screenplay.  <br />Another unexpected bonus feature shows the heavy impact this film had upon today's rappers, and how important it was to the Latino community to finally see Latinos on the screen in a major Hollywood film.  From the slang, to the clothes, to the details, this film captured the streets and then taught the next generation, and Puffy, Snoop, Eve, and a host of other music stars tell us all about it.  This is not something a kid in the suburbs would ever know just by watching the film, and thus is a valuable and insightful document of how this film became so much more than the sum of its parts.  <br />This DVD could have been sold for double the price and still be worth every penny in my book.  First, you get the money, then you get the power, and then, get this restored DVD----- and enjoy!
B00005JLEX|5.0|This is by far my faviorite show int the entire world. what i am wondering is why they dont have it on dvd. who ever is in charge of putting this show on dvd i hope u read this. i am telling you that you can make lots of money by putting this show on dvd, i cant even guess how many of my high school friends would buy this dvd. so my suggestion is to put this show i dvd and make lots of money. i know that i will buy it!!!!
B00005K9LK|4.0|In my opinion, this is the best Judas album! Although Judas isn't a very good metal band they still produced some good sounding songs, most of which are on this album. Chains and Electric Eye are my favourites from this album.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|This cd falls in line with the first Perfect Circle cd for me.  I have been hoping that Maynard would duplicate the raw energy that quantify the early Tool albums, yet Perfect Circle (and the two recent Tool cd's) are huge departures from the early style.  If you are looking for tight, early-Tool type music, this is not going to work for you.

B00009L1TA|3.0|The beggining of the movie promises a suspense and mistery in military enviroment, and I go OK - a con movie with some mistery I like it already, even if I did not see much that is going to stick me by the chair till the end. In about the midlle of the movie I realize it is not a military movie at all. What the heck is going on ? I'm hoping the story is not going down the road... The story gets twisted so much, and flashbacks are keeping you more wondering then boring. The reason why investigation started is not good enough and not explained good untill you see the end  of the movie. Why there was a need for more then two versions of the story ? Obviously not reasonable since only two people survived from the begging of the movie. I might say that I liked to see it twisted since I was expecting more spectacular revival of the story at the end . I also expected each side to get streighten up by one true version, but it comes to the end that the movie tries to make fools out person watching it. What was the reson to create so much confusion and so much twists ? Certanly by the way that it was filmed it loks like story is getting investingated and you belive that is true untill you see the uterly ridiculus ending that tells you: hey we knew what is going on... WHY DIDN'T YOU ??? Was that the expectation out of this movie.. I am still out of words to explain how messed this movie is.<BR>For the way that story is twisted I gave it 3 stars, even if there is no reson to twist it so much, which is clear at the end of the movie.  I would say the movie started excelent, it continued to keep that rating but at the end you see it lost its story that was not worthed to begin with.
B00003CXA6|4.0|\\"Gettysburg\\" is perhaps the best attempt by any film to capture a single battle from beginning to end. It is not a movie for everyone since there is no artificially-embedded love story (as in. \\"Pearl Harbor\\"), and in fact, there are no women in this movie at all.  It sets out to depict the largest battle ever fought on the American continent.  Its success is the product of the deliberate choice of the director to respect the source material, namely one of the finest historical war novels ever written, \\"The Killer Angels\\", by Michael Shaara.<br />Gettysburg is a battle of superlatives.  It was the largest and bloodiest encounter battle of the Civil War, adding up the three days between July 1 and July 3, 1863, and it tore the heart out of the Lee's Army of Northern Virginia..  It is also the most controversial battle, generating more than its share of debates over decisions and tactics.  Was Lee off his game at Gettysburg, as Shaara suggests?  Or, as other historians argue, was the battle lost by \\"Old Pete\\" Longstreet's case of the \\"slows\\" on July 2 (the attack on Devil's Den and Little Round Top) and July 3 (Pickett's Charge)?  Longstreet's postwar memoirs lay the blame for Pickett`s Charge squarely at Lee's feet, but since Longstreet joined the Republican party after the war, many Southerners are quick to blame him for Lee's defeat.<br />Shaara's book, and therefore the film, makes choices in this debate.  Shaara sides with Longstreet (aptly played by Tom Beringer), who is depicted as a thoughtful, reluctant warrior who vocally opposes the sanguinary frontal assaults launched by Lee on July 2nd and July 3rd .  (For a different perspective, I highly recommend Noah Trudeau's latest book, \\"Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage.\\")<br />It is a delight to see the musty daguerreotypes of Civil War leaders come to life as living, breathing characters.  For the Confederates, Tom Berringer's Longstreet is tops, followed by Confederate generals \\"Lo\\" Armistead (Richard Jordan) and Stephen Lang `s amazing George Pickett, a stunning contrast to Lang's later alabaster imitation of Christ as Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson in \\"Gods and Generals.\\"  These are interesting, complex people, and \\"Gettysburg\\" even manages a sense of humor.  The debate on Darwin between Pickett and Armistead is funny, concluding with Pickett defying any Southern gentleman to openly claim that \\"Robert E. Lee is descended from an ape.\\" On the Union side, there is Jeff Daniels as the bookish hero Joshua Chamberlain, Sam Elliott as the hard-bitten cavalry general Buford, and Brian Mallon's pugnacious General Winfield Scott Hancock.<br />Some die-hard grognards have complained that \\"Gettysburg\\" glosses over details of the battle.  But Shaara, and the film, were right to concentrate on the highlights: the initial skirmish and ultimate Union rout on July 1, the confused battle for Devil's Den, the Peach Orchard, and the against-all-odds defense of Little Round Top on July 2 by Joshua Chamberlain's (Jeff Daniels) 20th Maine; and, of course, Pickett's Charge.  Massive volumes have been written about just one day of the three day battle, and any film which tried to cover it all would be a ponderous bore.<br />The few speeches in the movie are necessary, I suppose, to explain the larger motives for the war.  Jeff Daniels' Chamberlain has to give the obligatory Abolitionist speech, and Armistead trys to explain the Southern \\"Cause\\" to the English camp follower Freemantle just before Pickett's Charge.  The few speeches in `Gettysburg\\"  hint at the malignancy that emerges full flower in \\"Gods and Generals\\" (written by a different Shaara) in which the camera's pause on any character become the excuse for a five to ten minutes of pious blather.<br />The flaws of the film are few.  One major flaw is Martin Sheen's portrayal of Robert E. Lee as an unblinking somnambulist, whose approach to strategy is by mumbling \\"it is God's will\\" as officers rush up with dispatches.  Robert Duvall's more animated Lee is the only (and I mean only improvement) that \\"Gods and Generals\\" has on \\"Gettysburg.\\"  Sheen's wide-eyed robot Lee is hard to square with the historical brilliance of Lee at Second Bull Run and Chancellorsville, and contemporary accounts of Lee as a witty conversationalist, a battlefield gambler, and with an eye for the ladies.<br />Ted Turner's use of thousands of amateur reenactors to stage the battle is both a blessing and a curse, but mostly a blessing.  Let's face it - the authentically-decked out and equipped amateur soldiers look far more like the real thing than the standard Spanish rent-an-army employed in similar epics such as \\"Waterloo.\\"  However, I suspect that the troops in the movie, particularly on the Southern side, are cleaner, neater, better fed and older (lots of retired folks are reenactors) than the actual participants in the battles.  (A common observation of the time was that you could smell Lee's troops approaching before you would see them).  The other problem with reenactors is they object to having their limbs and heads blown off, or torsos reduced to bloody pulp by cannon balls.  This is not \\"Private Ryan\\" or \\"Band of Brothers\\" - these soldiers, even when blasted by cannon, die clean deaths, and do not convey the historical eyewitness accounts of the horror, not to mention thousands of corpses set out in the hot July sun.  But these are very minor quibbles.  This is as good a re-enactment using real people as you can expect.<br />I recommend \\"Gettysburg\\" for historical movie fans, and do not forget the wonderful Ken Burns' documentary, \\"The Civil War.\\"e animated Lee is the only (and I mean only improvement) that \\"Gods and Generals\\" has on \\"Gettysburg.\\"  Sheen's wide-eyed robot Lee is hard to square with the historical brilliance of Lee at Second Bull Run and Chancellorsville, and contemporary accounts of Lee as a witty conversationalist, a battlefield gambler, and with an eye for the ladies.  <br />Ted Turner's use of thousands of amateur reenactors to stage the battle is both a blessing and a curse, but mostly a blessing.

B00005AAFS|4.0|This is Rammstein's best album, but I don't think it's perfect. It contains good industrial sounds, but some songs sound too rough.
0198534469|3.0|I used this book in an introductory Complex Variables course in a top 20 ranked US college.  I enjoyed the authors clear explaination of material and clearly british sense of humor.  Unfortunately I felt it lacked a great deal of rigor.  Proofs were often either just sketched or pictorally shown.  I understand that it was the author's objective to give a purely goemetric approach, but I felt that more detail was needed.  When I needed to use ideas such as residue classes and other important complex variable conecepts in later math courses, my background was weak.  <br />I agree that the book does have merits.  It takes the field of complex variables and looks at it in another way.  I do feel though, that a more traditional book would be better to first secure undersatanding of the material.  If a student were to continue to graduate work or want to learn more about complex variables, this would be a good supplement.  I do not feel though, that this book is a good main, first text.
B0000931QA|5.0|This whole album is an enjoying listen from beginning to end. It's full of good sounds, thoughtful lyrics, and tells a whole story. A must for a Queensryche fan or anyone else. Some of my favourite songs are on this album like Revoluting Calling, Breaking The Silence, I Don't Believe In Love, and Eyes Of A Stranger.
B00007ELEL|5.0|I think this is the funniest movie Ive ever seen.  It is honest to goodness genius. Now if youve seen it once and think &quot;Oh thats stupid..&quot; then you just dont get it.  Would you listen to some CD one time and then form an opinion on it saying its the best/worst CD ever?  MMMMBop would still be on the radio all the time if that was the case.  I think with this movie it can actually be classified as art.  The more you see it, the more you appreciate how good it is.  Ive seen it probably a hundred times and every time I'm surprised by how good the acting really is.  Some of it is pretty subtle (not Jesus though, has there ever been a better supporting character!) but after you see it a few times and arent focused solely on all the lotta in's, a lotta out's, a lotta what-have-you's (of the story) its possible to recognize the genius.  Not everybody is going to get this movie, in fact if you think Ace Ventura is the funniest movie ever, well, (1)you're stupid, and (2)it's over your head, dont waste your time.  However, if you are like the 900+ other people that attended Lebowskifest (its becoming that &quot;cult&quot; of a movie) then check it out.  Again, and again, and again. It seriously gets funnier everytime I see it.  Thats my opinion man.  Say what you want about the tenets of national socialism but at least its an ethos. Yeah.
B000002KMY|4.0|This album starts out well with the songs Turn Up The Night and The Sign Of The Southern Cross and then follows with good, but not very good songs like The Mob Rules and Country Girl. This is a must for any Sabbath fan. I think that Dio in vocals is better than Ozzy.
B000099T2L|5.0|I bought the albumn, and I think the album is HOTT!!  Beyonce set it off with her unique, crazy style.  My girl is off tha shizzle.  My faves are SIGNS featuring Missy, CRAZY In LOVE featuring Jay-Z, SPEECHLESS, YES, and NAUGHTY GIRL. Well, basically the whole albumn. I can connect with the music; I'm really feeling it.  Her style is just unreal.  She shows her own creative style that's all the can offer because it's solo.  So don't expect to see DC's Beyonce, expect to Beyonce as her self. She may have changed a lot since DC, but she still brings flavor, talent, and extreme performances to her fans. If no one likes her albumn, I do.<br />So I say go and buy the albumn, cause if you don't somebody else will.<br /> Good work girl and keep it up.  Your albumn is great, but you know what you gotta do: Shake 'em off!!
B00009L1UP|5.0|This album competes with Operation: Mindcrime as one of my favourite albums. It contains good sounding songs with thoughtful lyrics from beginning to end (except for the bonus tracks). I recommend it to anyone.
0099416921|5.0|Not only do I think that &quot;Venetia&quot; is Georgette Heyer's best novel, I think Venetia is one of her best characters, and certainly one of my favorite heroines in all romance fiction. She is extremely intelligent and well read, possesses poise, a wonderful sense of humor, and lots of common sense. She is down-to-earth and earthy in a very ladylike way, and a charming, caring person. Venetia is also quite lovely, but her character is so good and strong, that were she only half as beautiful, she would still outshine her peers.<br />Venetia Lanyon is twenty-five years old, orphaned, and responsible for her frail younger brother Aubrey, who is crippled by a disease of the hip-joint. She is also legally responsible for the family manse and lands in Yorkshire, while their older brother and heir, Conway, is away at war in France. Although Venetia has much going for her in the way of looks, charm and intelligence, and has two loyal suitors nearby, she is determined not to wed unless it is for love. Her father, when he was alive, was a recluse and showed little interest in his children except to forbid Venetia's coming out in London society, sponsored by her very willing aunt. Unaware of the unattached treasure in Yorkshire, London society and many probable excellent matches had to get by without Venetia.<br />Then, quite by accident, Venetia meets her neighbor, Lord Damerel, who has rarely visited his land since he returned from exile. Damerel is charismatic but not handsome, middle-aged and quite the worst rake, having flown the country with another man's wife years before. Since that liaison broke up, he has been leading a fast, devil-may-care existence and is not received in respectable society. Of course the lady and the rogue are quite taken with each other, and of course many complications ensue. Yet it is clear from their first meeting that the two are soul mates. This is most definitely not the same tired story of good girl meets bad boy and reforms him, etc. - not with Georgette Heyer at the helm.<br />Ms. Heyers plot and prose are tight, her writing marvelous, and her wit at its best both in the wonderful dialogue between all the characters, and in the many twists and turns the story takes. Venetia is truly amazing with her matter-of-fact air when faced with outrageous circumstances. And Damerel is a most wonderful dark hero, who finally sees the light. Their exploits are delightful. And Ms. Heyer is able, as always, to build sexual tension to a peak with never more than a kiss between the lovers. Her descriptions of the North Country are lyrical, her unusual cast of characters are well developed, and her description of England during the Regency period is very accurate and fascinating. Superb humor and irony are liberally sprinkled throughout.<br />This is a wonderful novel, and probably my favorite Regency Romance.<br />JANA- not with Georgette Heyer at the helm.<br />Ms. Heyers plot and prose are tight, her writing marvelous, and her wit at its best both in the wonderful dialogue between all the characters, and in the many twists and turns the story takes.

I LOVE IT!!!<br />other than that, the movie has some good moments, good shots, and then there's JP3.<br />for one, i'm a huge fan of the T-Rex and to see it get KO'd in less than 1 minute was flat out a disgrace. <br />two, the acting is very off in this movie. in the original Jurassic Park, the acting was AWSOME and REAL. it felt real, and made you believe like you were actually there with them in the park, and like you were being chased by the T-Rex, yet here, it's like, &quot;oh, here comes a dinosaur, run!&quot; <br />acting was to dry, and then to top it off, to corny.<br />how do we begin this movie? by two parents on the brink of a divorce who let their kids who aren't even 18 yet, go on a vacation that includes parachuting near the island of Jurassic Park?<br />finally, this movie was to short! it runs at about 1 hour 23 minutes!?!? yet in the theater, it felt like 3 hours long. why? cause it wasn't that good. <br />JP 3 was to fast and quick and should have been slowed down like the original film and re-casting wound not have hurt either.<br />still, it's a Jurassic Park movie, so i had to get it. hey, i got it for $5.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Enigma's Voyageur is very different from their previous projects in sound and atmosphere...This new body of work has been criticized for not having the Gregorian or dark-symphonic heavy laden sounds as before. Get over it ! Cretu,wife Sandra, Ruth Anne, and Andru Donalds are on a new and different path...Listen to the opening track and this time only a very faint hint of the usual &quot;Enigmatic horn theme opening&quot; is used and by the end of the cd there may or may not be any trace of it left.Could this indicate that in the next Enigma future titles to follow the opening theme has been scrapped for a new one or none at all? This my fellow listeners is part of the re-invention or change into a new direction (probably hence the title Voyageur)...What I particularly noticed in some of the tracks is a more of a techno-funk sound while other tracks such as The Piano and Total Eclipse of the Moon add a classical flavor to the mix. The category New Age may be a misnomer for this cd since it has a more sophisticated pop and uplifting feel in some of the tracks that this time around should make Enigma radio-friendly. Has Enigma sold out ? Definitely not. Though the phrase &quot;radio-friendly&quot; or term would shock the most devoted of fans since Enigma assumed by many is suppose to only produce real cerebral music not for the masses but for a select understanding few. In comparing the very first release which debuted in 1990 against this one, the two are worlds apart and for all the right reasons (and the reasons are too many to go over);the most obvious is that the hip-hop Gregorian sampling days are over and done with (outdated) ! In sum, listening to the new Engima title is like actually listening to them for the first time, again. Clear the mind and forget what you remember. That is the reason why so many listeners and critics have to hear this several times before they get it. I heard it once and was happily satisfied!
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is the perfect blend of great acting, insightful plot, thrilling pace, and sharp theme. <br />Hawke, Thurman, and Law give passionate portrayals of the characters each facing their own imperfections. The scenes move fluently without seeming trite. The setting of the movie cleverly mimics the Hoover era of US History.  <br />This possible genetics based future represented in this film seems to grow ever closer in our society due to our overwhelming desire for science and business to meld. This plot is shocking because it's plausible. <br />This movie ranks in my top ten of all time.
6305320802|3.0|I had the pleasure and good fortune to see this on TCM recently and learned for the first time that the movie was actually filmed for its theatrical release TWICE!!  I viewed the film on VHS years ago from a conventional 'fullscreen' Cinemascope print and thought nothing of it. Imagine my surprise when I saw Turner's broadcast of it in the 'Todd-AO' wide-screen version!! The color saturation is positively stunning (it has been mentioned that the T-AO film process actually shot more frames per second, which accounts for that sharpness and saturation) and makes certain sequences, like the opening number &quot;Oh What A Beautiful Morning&quot; and sections of the &quot;Out Of My Dreams&quot; ballet explode on screen. The Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein songs are magnificent (notably &quot;Poor Jud is Dead,&quot; &quot;I Cain't Say No,&quot; and &quot;People Will Say We're In Love&quot;), the color cinematography is stunning (note the crisp, blue skies), a lasso dance by Gene Nelson in a railway depot is a standout, but some of the characters and subsequent performances (like Rod Steiger's manic-depressive farmhand Jud) are more than a bit over-the-top. Accept this premise and you'll be just fine. The Todd-AO version of the film is currently available on DVD. Grab it, and fast-forward to your favorite parts.
B00005UEAR|2.0|How can a band like Dream Theater release another weak album after the release of one of the weakest album of their history, Metropolis 2000, is a mistery.  And why release a two disc set that does not cointain enough good material to release a single album is another one.  Dream Theater wake up !!!!! This music is boring!!! A 42 minutes song full of riffs and tecnical stuff is not music, it's a perfect narcotic medicine. I'm telling this because I love Dream Theater and I am in anger with them because in my opinion they did a lot of wrong choices about their career.  First of all. Kevin Moore should remain the creative head behind the band. They never should permit him to leave the band. His sense of poetry,  his weird arrangements were responsible for some of the best moments in Dream Theater history.  Sherinian and Ruddess are both perfect players from a technical standpoint this is not the problem. But they fail to me because they did not take to the band inspiration ... The fact is that DT music until falling into Infinity (their worst album ever) was a perfect blend of aggressive parts and delicate parts. Only Moore was responsible for the seconds. And infact actually in DT we have only aggressive riffs that tend to bore me to death after a while.  Sherinian and Ruddess didn't take the Moore's chair which is still empty.  Another false move was to go in the direction of direct heavy music. There's less attention to details now in DT music, less attention to arrangements. Their music is more direct, heavy, but a lot less rich, intelligent,  and evocative.  Probably the reason lies in the fact that the band want to be appealing to a younger audience less sophisticated.  I don't know. The result is that I don't like this new band. My Dream Team remains the one responsible for Images and Words, in my opinio, one of the best, if not the overall best album of the last 20 years.  In the end two little advices to DT. The first. Stop record epic music, Overture and Grand Finale. This attempts produce only terrible kitsch music that lacks any value at all!! You guys are not classical composer c'mon!!! Be serious.  The second. &quot;No matter how far you have gone down the wrong road. Turn back.&quot;nd Finale. This attempts produce only terrible kitsch music that lacks any value at all!! You guys are not classical composer c'mon!!! Be serious.  The second. &quot;No matter how far you have gone down the wrong road. Turn back.&quot;

B00005JMCR|5.0|This is DEFINATELY one of the FUNNIEST movies of the year! I give mad props to the director for creating such a incredible and hillarious movie. Like many people have said, I thought it would be a total letdown without some of the other characters but after watching the movie, I wasn't disappointed at all. To be honest with you all, I truly do believe that this is the BEST movie in the series. This made me laugh my mouth off from start to finish and the plot to the story was incredibly done. I also believe that the actors and actresses put their best effort to make a great ending to the series. However, this does get me questioning: will this movie truly end the series? I highly believe that there will be another one (I'm hoping too) and I'm sure a lot of people out there would want to see another AMERICAN PIE once they see this. There are some funny scenes and scenes you won't want to miss in this movie! The scene where Stifler enjoys the dogs licking his pants has to be the funniest scene I have seen so far this year! The bachelor's party is the best scene by far... see it and you will understand why this is so. The most disgusting scene is where Stifler eats the dog's crap, to save Michelle's mom from eating it (she believes it's chocolate and Michelle's mom loves eating chocolate). It was so disgusting, it put me off my food after seeing that bit but that definately wasn't a let-down to the movie. Another disgusting part which will make you jump off your seats is the part where Stifler is in a rush to meet Cadence in the closet. It's dark so Stifler cannot see and believes Cadence is in there so he starts feeling up \\"Cadence\\". Eventually, you'll find that Stifler is having sex with... Jim's grandmother when Finch opens up the door! There are some new characters added to the movie, like:<BR>Michelle's hot as blonde sister, Cadence<BR>Michelle's parents<BR>Jim's grandma<BR>and plenty more.<br />I really enjoyed this movie and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. Thereare a lot of excellent scenes in here and the movie is just fantastic. I would highly reccommend anyone to see this movie. It's so funny, even your parents will enjoy it. This is a great and memorable way to end the series, but I hope that AMERICAN PIE does come out.
B000002LRX|5.0|This is by far one of the highlight releases from any band in the last 20 years. Yes that's saying alot, but Mike patton and the band really showcase great talent and creativity as well as great songwriting all in one disasterly beautiful masterpiece.  This CD has influenced many &quot;new metal&quot; bands and surley inspired the new wave of heavy bands. I suppose it's a good thing they broke up when they did as the last record was a bit of a disapointment. But Angel Dust will forever remain one of the top
B00008H2LB|5.0|How does LINKIN PARK do it.This cd is better than the first.I would recomend this cd to anybody.There is not a single song on it that i don't like.All i got to say is good job LINKIN PARK and keep the cd's coming!
B0000039PW|5.0|b4 he died he put this out. THis symbolized his talent and passsiion towards tha game. RIP
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Erykah Badoo is a great soul singer, and with each album she gets closer and closer to sounding as great as Janet Jackson.  \\"Worldwide Underground\\" isn't as funky as Janet's \\"The Velvet Rope,\\" but it's got some good songs and interesting beats.  You go, Erykah!
B000084T18|2.0|When this is what's hot...that's perfectly clear.  The highlight of this album is &quot;Many Men,&quot; and most 50 fans hate that particular track.  The first single was the weakest track on the LP.  &quot;21 Questions&quot; is another mediocre radio hit saved by the vocals of Nate Dogg, while &quot;P.I.M.P.&quot; is another pseudo-Southern hit saved by Snoop Dogg's indestructability.  The rest of the tracks just kind of blend into each other.  The beats are nice to listen to, while not very original.  The rhymes are even less so.  Save yourself the money and the trip to the record store, download the singles, and wait for the next peon to come along.
B00003CXA6|3.0|Gettysburg is a 'fairly' good 'made for TV' movie.  It's portrayal of an inept Robert E. Lee does make you wonder how the Civil War could have gone on for so long, though.  Of course, what could you expect from a movie that has cameos of Ted Turner and Senator Byrd? The re-enactments of the fighting is pretty good.  Although you do find yourself wondering where everyone is.  The movie doesn't really convey the idea of a titanic clash of 'Armies' when they only show a few dozen men at a time.  I don't know, maybe they had to stay under a tight budget and couldn't afford a lot of extras. One thing, that I doubt would have cost them and would have made the movie immensely more believable, would have been to replace Martin Sheen.  Mr. Sheen played Robert E. Lee the same way he played his part in 'Apocalypse Now'.  It's hard to understand how the eye rolling, mumbling, bumbling and almost incoherent General Lee that Mr. Sheen portrayed could have inspired anyone to fight.  Much less tired, hungry and barefoot Confederate soldiers. Like I said, it's OK. But, wait till you find it on sale to buy it. Or better yet, rent it.  You probably won't want to watch it again anyway.
0425188809|5.0|This book is definitely a must-read. It kept me on the edge of my seat from cover to cover. There is never a dull moment in the book. I was intrigued by how Koontz painted a vivid picture of each character in my mind. There was never a dull moment of suspense either. This book was definitely a page turner. You just can't wait to find out what will happen next. If you have a chance to read this book, don't miss it!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|When I first got this album, I popped it into my car and played the first song and I was absolutely stunned. 7 Minutes and 40 seconds of shear beauty... There is no boring repetition, constant modification of sound in the song and I was already itching to play the rest... I won't go through each song individually, but I was worried that with the loss of 2 members, where would be a loss of quality. Not the case at all... For all those hard core Tool fans, you must remember, this is NOT TOOL, it is definitely a toned down version if you would like to call it that. By no means are they replicating Tool, but the music has a much more darker sound that needs attention and a few times to listen to each song. If you liked the first album, this is an absolute must buy.
1558216847|1.0|My impession is that it is fake. It just doesn't feel true. I've read quite a few books on various prison camps in various wars and this book just doesn't ring true. The polish prisioners speak using british slang. There was no name gathering. No documentation. I don't believe they'd be in any shape to make a 4,000 mile trek from freezing Siberia, over the Himalayas, thru deserts etc. <br />Slavomir Rawicz also claims to have seen Bigfoot. He describes an encounter with two 8 foot tall creatures somewhere between Bhutan and Sikkim. According to Slavomir, he and his companions watched the outsized beasts for over 2 hours, from a distance of 100 yards.<BR> <BR>I just resently finished Ghost Soldiers: Hamptton Sides. Now there's a true story about a forced march to two prison camps and a rescue/escape. I've always known about Bataan's POW death march and 3.5 years imprisonment but this was mt first book.
0385334206|5.0|I had decided to read a Vonnegut novel since there is so much buzz among some of my elitist friends about what a genius he is. I was not dissappointed.<br />The book had a very interesting feel to it.  I appreciated the way that the author would deliberatley stray from the subject from time to time as if he was telling a story rather than writing a book.  I also liked the way he satirizes American culture. He describes a common occourence like it was the first time you had ever heard about it.  For instance he feels he must remediate the reader as to why men buy pornography.<br />Some other reviewers have commented about the amount of racism in the novel.  It is true that there is a lot of racism in the book, but I think that the author does this to show the evil inherent in racism and not to be racist himself, much the way Mark Twain does in Huckleberry finn.  To acknowledge that racism exists does not make you racist.  <br />The novel builds to a very interesting climax which presents a paradox that I never seen done in American literature.  I will reveal this paradox only because it is what attracted me to the novel in the first place. If you do not want to know read no further.  <br />Vonnegut writes himself into the novel and confronts his main character revealing to him that he is a fabrication, a creature of his own mind.
B00006879E|2.0|They're catchy, they're mildy entertaining. While Maroon 5 puts out a decent album, it's basically some poppy hits and very little substance. At times they go as far as to sound like backstreet boys on guitar. While the make an attempt at a new fusion sound, they become predictable and there songs seem to all sound similar. Referring to them as hard rock is ridiculous, referring to them as alternative pop seems right on. It's not great stuff, it gets boring and tired, and those music purists like me may not make it through the first listen.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I've always been a huge At The Drive-In fan, since their early days. I was crushed when they parted but held hope for the new projects I heard about. Sparta are good, they have they're moments but they don't do a lot for me. DeFact is very creative and entrancing. And The Mars Volta I thought was pretty good, after buying the EP, which I wasn't impressed with. <br />But when I first heard about this album I was excited to hear it. The day it hit stores I picked it up and... Words cannot describe the greatness this album holds. The power, the energy, the sheer beauty of it is just mind-boggling. I can listen to this over and over again, which is uncommon with albums these days. This is not At The Drive-In, this is not Sparta, and this is like nothing you've ever heard before, (unless you've heard the ep but even then it's quite different.)<br />If you've ever doubted this band, think again. This is easily on of my top 10 albums ever. It was the album of the summer and if you don't have it. Just buy it. Don't listen to me, but listen to what REAL music is. The Mars Volta IS real music.
B00000I07P|5.0|this album is one of the greatest albums of all times it has the freshman feel but a veteren sound a wonderful mix I was up dancing and singing along the whole time it has so many hits and hidden wonders another great album.
B00000I07P|5.0|THIS is the Rock Album of the MILENIUM! Bon Jovi has always been one of the most impressive bands of the century But this was the album that made them! with Hits like &quot;You give love a bad name&quot; and the greatest hit they have ever had &quot;livin on a prayer&quot;  It pushed this album to Mainstream success. Buy this album and i promise you will put it on repeat for Hours. Im playing it right now! B U Y  I T !<br />yours truly the prince of pop
B000001FYL|5.0|I got this CD and i was so amazed because i have never heard a soundtrack that fit the movie so well every song on the album just fit the movie everytime i watch that movie i can hear the songs during certain parts because they fit so well. if you want to have fun and feel like your in the movie listen to this cd.
B000002GVO|4.0|GReat C.D!<BR> I have the original LP which i nearly worn out! But with songs like &quot;Life in the fast lane&quot; and the smooth yet lean &quot;Hotel california&quot; how can you go wrong? Its top Notch! you can't get any creative then this . I once heard that credence was the greatest rock band ever. I think not The eagles takes the CASE! Buy it you will be impressed! or Just buy it for the love of a double guitar!<br />Short And sweet<BR>By prince of pop
B00000I07Q|5.0|this is a great album because with this album alng with every albume from jon and the guys you can't help but dance and sing along with every song on this album you can hear the fun and they had while recording this album not to mention the raw attitude it has.5 stars great album
B00000DGUG|3.0|Having taken a chance on Jagged Little Pill and being very pleased with that CD, I decided to take another chance and buy this CD.  The reviews I read were more inconsistent, but since I was beyond my adolescent years, I thought it might be more a matter of age related taste.  This is a very different CD than Jagged Little Pill.  I thought the first 5 songs on the CD were very good--not as intense as Jagged Little Pill, but good songs.  The remaining 12 songs were very inconsistent--some were pretty good, but some were pretty bad.  The last song on the CD sounded like church music and not at all what I bought the CD for and left a bad taste with me.  Overall, I thought the CD was okay but not near as good as Jagged Little Pill.  I bought the CD hoping for the same passion and intensity I heard in Jagged Little Pill, but it wasn't there.  I am now questioning what kind of sound will come out of her future CDs and am much more doubtful about buying Under Rug Swept.  I think she is a very talented singer, but if her future CDs are not more like Jagged Little Pill and less like this one, I think she will lose a lot of fan interest.
B00000I07R|5.0|this album is just a great 90's album it's has many upbeat songs along with some slow and calming songs and has alot of soul. it's definitly worth buying and keeping in your collection for ever.
B000002MY3|4.0|I had some concerns about whether this album would appeal to someone beyond their adolescent years, but having heard positive comments, I decided to take a chance.  I liked it. It is filled with passion and intensity and has very good background music.  There are a couple of songs that are more oriented to an angry adolescent population, but overall it is a good CD I would recommend.
0156027321|5.0|I read this book in a single day and immediately began reading it over again!  This is truly a wondrous, grown-up fairytale; something to keep you thinking after the lights go out, if you can possibly force yourself to put it down long enough!  I loved the details--they were bright, colorful, and soulful.  The story itself is highly engaging and constantly testing the boundaries of factual fiction and fictional fact.  The wonderful writing, the lovely characters, the amazing story of survival and struggle--I was convinced this was nonfiction.  I found myself on Google searching for Tsimtsum and other brilliantly researched facts.  I wish I had thought of this first!
0441003257|3.0|There's a quote on the cover that calls it &quot;A direct descendant of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.  And while I think the type of wacky humor is very similar, it really pales in comparison.  The authors never really sold me on the characters.  Crowley is no Zaphod and Anathema no Trillian.  All of them just feel underdeveloped through the first couple of hundred pages.  <BR>It was by no means a page turner, just something I picked back up every couple of days and read a few dozen pages in.
B000002UZ1|5.0|I urge this 2 disc set for anyone who has ever found themseves singing along with &quot;Hey Jude&quot; or &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; - this collection has it all. The beauty of the Beatles' later years is captured wonderfully in this set and you can see their progression, from the playful &quot;Penny Lane&quot; to the truly revolutionary &quot;Revolution&quot; (horrible pun - yes I know, but it works) on to the poetic &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and closing off with the last song they released as a group, the aptly-named &quot;Long and Winding Road.&quot; Buy this for anyone who loves music.<br />P.S. And for the person who said that they prefer Avril's music to this - you are truly a fool.
B00009L7N1|4.0|Wow, this CD is simply awesome.  &quot;Sunrise&quot; will make you shake out of your chair!  Couple remakes I am not fond of, but overall a great listen!
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido would always amaze me with her songs. Her songs are a big inspiration for me. I remember listening to the No Angel CD and it brought back memories. Her songs are touching.<br />Well Life for Rent is a very good CD. I tottally recommend it. To me, I feel the song, Life For Rent, I can relate to the most. It is inspiring and sets a perfect mood. It always brings my spirits up.
B000002IJO|5.0|Ratt was one of my favorite bands from the 80's. Their first two full albums &quot;Out of the Cellar&quot; and &quot;Invasion of your Privacy&quot; were very good, but for me, this is where the band put it all together. Never have they sounded so smooth and tight, with razor sharp guitars and great hooks throughout. &quot;Dance&quot;, &quot;Body Talk&quot;, &quot;One good Lover&quot; etc. are all outstanding 80's hard rock. If you get one RATT album, this is the one
B0000029DD|5.0|One of the most passionate and profoundly beautiful almbums that I have been fortunate enough to hear is made all the more special by the feeling one gets from knowing that comparitively few people have been touched by it. Jeff Buckley always despised the notion of global Buckleymania and posthumously he gets his wish. Although it seems tragic that this album is not spread across the world being listened to in steros in all four corners I've always treasured the feeling of finding another Jeff lover and sharing with them my own personal high points on this masterpiece of an album. Knowing that one is part of a select crowd makes you feel that much closer to the man himself. I won't attempt to describe the album itself as words on a screen do it no kind of justice. Buy the album and then everything else by Jeff that is available as no two recordings of the same song are alike and all should be listened to. Miraculous.
B000001DWG|4.0|By now, most know the story of Mother Love Bone. Loquacious singer Andy Wood died of a heroin overdose and members Jeff Ament(bass) and Stone Gossard(guitars) went on to form Pearl Jam. Wood's obvious charisma comes through on everyone of these tracks, as a wise-cracking, sometimes sentimental master of ceremonies. Had he lived, a comedy career could have been in the cards following music. On \\"Half Ass Monkey Boy\\" he asks if anyone wants a taste of his \\"beef swellington.\\" The questioning \\"Mr.Danny Boy\\" has his dad asking if Wood's gay, while extolling his adoration for the glam of T-Rex. Wood was definitely an old school frontman; sort of a cross between Ted Nugent and David Lee Roth. Luckily, his filthy humor isn't all the band had going for it. Gossard and fellow guitarist Andy Fairweather rip off riff after riff of Zeppelin worship. \\"Stardog Champion\\" shows Jimmy Page's open string ideas in full view and the dynamics of  \\"Bone China\\" would sound right at home on \\"Physical Grafitti.\\" Wood's piano compositions, \\"Gentle Groove\\" and \\"Chloe Dancer\\" slow things down and are among the strongest songs here, showing a glimpse into what could have been.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead are a band that will never become stagnant. On a recent journey to Edinburh I sat in my window seat, watched the countryside go by and listened to all Radiohead's albums and the journey is incredible. From their early angry rock on Pablo Honey to the innovative and intrepid workings of Kid A to the utterly exquisite cocktail of sounds and experiences on Hail To the Thief. It's so rare to find a band that truly learn from their experiences and use them to push themselves to the next stop on their own musical train ride. Word of mouth about this album is that Radiohead have betrayed their roots having abandoned their raw angst on Pablo Honey. I say that the roots have allowed them to become a mighty oak and now they stand tall. From the opening to the end of this album the quality is staggering. 2+2=5 is one of the greatest opening tracks I have ever heard, sounding like an amalgamation of three different tracks and starting things off perfectly. High points(too many to mention them all) of the album personally are Backdrifts - Wonderful sound - There There - Classic Radiohead - I will - Haunting harmonies - and Wolf at the Door - lyrical masterpiece. Buy it now and then shout at people who don't like it.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|It is worth remembering what happened when Will asked Gibbs this question.  To recap, Gibbs was telling Will the tall tale of how Jack Sparrow (sorry, Captain Jack Sparrow) escaped being marooned on an island after the mutiny.  As soon as Will started asking too many questions about the details, Jack walked up and gave us a hilarious reminder to just go with the tale already.  That little sequence is a nice microcosm for the whole POTC experience.<br />The moral of the story is that, for the movie and the soundtrack, don't ask so many questions, don't nitpick for logic, don't be so analytic!  If these are your reactions to the film or the music, I suspect that there are other parts of your life where you have forgotten how to play.  Having fun is what this film and the music are all about.  You will be a much less boring person if you can learn how to enjoy them!<br />Thanks, Disney, and congratulations for a job well done.  Loved the movie.  Loved the soundtrack.
B00000K31Q|5.0|While the story of this movie is typically teen, the excellent cast and the witty script (based on Shakspeare's &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot;) are excellent, which makes this movie above average for its genre.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|From Cocteau and Renoir to Besson and Ozon, French cinema has earned its deserved place as one of the best in the world. The Nouvelle Vague started by a group of film critics, among them were Truffaut and Goddard, who were unhappy by the then state of cinema and wanted a change that they saw was not forthcoming too soon, so they went on and did their own movies and in the process forever changed the way films are directed, written, edited and as equally important analyzed too.<BR>It is the cinema that Hollywood often seeks refuge in when original ideas have dried up,to remake and readapt classic films.<BR>However, unlike in Britain and America,French cinema did not excel in all genres.<BR>Science fiction and horror are almost non existant, and thrillers are few and far between nowadays,while action movies were only given a recent revival by the likes of Besson,(influenced by Hollywood and taking advantage of the new advances in the technology).Instead what French cinema excelled in were the drama/romance and comedy genres. Strangely only the latter remained largely confined to France and the francophone countries,although with actors like Fernandel, Pierre Richard, Bouvril, 'Les Charlots' and the genuis that was Louis De Funes,and directors like Claude Zidi and Gerard Oury, the output was very rich and funny.<BR>Not until Dinner Game that is. <BR>Francis Veber, another brilliant comedy writer/director who was responsible for classic hits (many remade by Hollywood, such as the Toy, the Man with one Red Shoe, and The Fugitives),managed finally with The Dinner Game to take French comedies from the confines of the domestic market and of very few enthusiasts around the globe, to worldwide commercial fame.<BR>And in a way it is an inevitable outcome, for The Dinner Game is one of the best written comedy of all time in any language,and this where the secret of its success firmly lies: The writing.<BR>Francois Pignon, the character that Veber invented and used in his earlier movies with Pierre Richard in La Chevre and Les Comperes, is the main ingredient of the success behind The Dinner Game.<BR>A lonely person,down on his luck, with failed or non existant relationships,clumsy, getting himself and others into deep trouble, but with a heart of gold,always trying to help as best as he knows how, or trying at least to redress the difficult situation he put himself in.<BR>This of course brings out many laughs, but there is a twist.<BR>Unlike most characters in comedies, Francois Pignon, and especially in The Dinner Game is a much more complex person that it seems. The character is multi-layered, and the funny Pignon we laugh so much with, hides also a sadness we see glimpses of in his eyes, not too long to ruin the comic pace, but just enough to give him enough depth and poignancy.This is why underneath all the fun, we sympathize closely with Pignon, turning him into a small champion.As is the norm in French Cinema, there is a lot of analytical/psychological, three dimensional approach to their characters, even in comedies.<BR>And of course, there is so much laughter in this movie. The situation comedy can not get any better.From the very start, <BR>A group of well to do obnoxious 'yuppies' like to invite 'idiots' to a dinner and make fun of and  humiliate, just for quicks. Thierry Lhermitte, a member of this group, however will soon bite much more than he can chew, nearly ruining his life when he meets his new 'idiot', Francois Pignon, played perfectly by Jacques Villeret.I believe he is the best Pignon! His expressions, his childish enthusiasm, geniune regret, twisted problem solving and reasoning, are so well portrayed on screen. <BR>The beauty of Dinner Game is the fact that at the end, Pignon, who represent a silent majority triumphs against all odds, and the ones whom society always applauds: the rich, strong,powerful,and priviledged have been put in their right place, if only temporarily.<BR>This makes Dinner Game one of the best comedies ever written, it will make you laugh no matter how many times you watch it,but it offers much much more, and this is the secret of its success and with it French Cinema.
B00005JKZV|5.0|'The Two Towers' - being the second movie in a tirlogy - is in a natural position to be a disappointment. It doesn't have the benefit of being 'new' (and therefore surprising) like the first, or being as grand as the third. But this wasn't a disappointment - at least to me. Nothing I can write here can convince any of the purists that resented the changes Peter Jackson &amp; co. made to the story are OK. I hope they fel better knowing that The Two Towers was the farthest away the crew strayed from the original book. I still enjoyed it, regardless of the changes, and I'm looking forward to the extended version.<br />This brings me to the only thing I found worth complaining about: the extra features are some of the worst I've seen on DVDs. The only one worth watching was the Return of the King preview. As for the rest - it would've been better to have no features at all. Most of them seem to be either the crew excitedly telling us how great Return of the King is going to be, or something to do with Sean Austin's short movie 'The Long &amp; The Short Of It&quot;. With all due respect to Mr. Austin and his work, I don't find his work to be relevant as a part of this DVD. I'm sure the special extended edition of this movie would contain awsome features (jsut as the last one did), and the studio had les us know about the editions in advance, but it still doesn't feel good to buy a 'fanccy' 2 disk set, with the 2nd only containing about 5 - 10 minutes of something worth watching.<br />Unless you are a very dedicated fan of the series, I would reccommend renting this DVD and buy the extended version instead.
0385504209|5.0|This book was extraordinary. There. All my thoughts in four words. I rate it along with &quot;West Point:...Thomas Jefferson&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick as one of the two most extraordinary books on the market. But don't just believe me. See for yourself.
0385504209|5.0|I haven't even read this book yet, but I'm very intrigued.  I believe that any book that gets you to think about God is a step in the right direction.  As I understand it, God gave us free will.  I'll use my free will to read this book and arrive at my own conclusios.  It's strange how all these staunch Christians have had their faith shaken by this one little book.  Makes one wonder just how fragile their beliefs may be.  I look forward to reading this title.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I loved this cd from the first listen,face it Erykah is not out here trying to do the same thing everyone is doing,and I respect her for that.I agree this cd is short,but it's packed with so much,jazz,funk,soul.And you can really hear the Chaka Khan influence on this cd(I know Chaka must be proud).Being a huge fan,I must agree with one of the reviewers on here when he said &quot;go see her in concert,it will change your life&quot;.I saw her earlier this year in DC,and it was the BEST show I've seen.Peace  &quot;COP THAT DISC&quot;
B000089RVR|3.0|Dido has finally released her second CD to give her fans something they have been wanting for a long time. She has tremendous talent and a unique vocal style which unfortunately gets a bit tiring half way through this CD. I was hoping she would venture into a something a bit different from her debut &quot;No Angel&quot;. There are no paths untravelled. She sticks to what she knows and doesn't stray away. She is capable of so much more!! The programmed drum machine gets annoying as it is very prominent in the mix of nearly every song. The use of a real drummer would really help the life of these potentially great songs. Highlights include the single &quot;White Flag&quot; and most notably &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot;. It's a pleasant and familiar sound, but don't expect much in the way of diversity.
0425188809|5.0|I have just recently begun to read Dean Koontz books, and was told that this book was the best.  I borrowed it from my friend, and I was hooked on Dean Koontz books.  What was most surprising to me was how Dean Koontz could get the reader so attached to the characters in the book, and how he was able to build up your suspense, while keeping you hooked on the book for such a long time.  He will keep you guessing what will happen, but I found out that I was always wrong.  The ability to come up with such surprising turns in the book is the real reason why Dean Koontz is such a great writer.  This was an outstanding book and I would recommend it to anyone, even if you don't enjoy reading now, you will when you get through with this book.
0812513495|5.0|This book was the best I have ever read which is why I give it a five star rating. The book is genius in its self along with Ender and the humor is quite good. Yet I couldn't get over the fact that the enemy was called the buggers, it just sounds so corney and who would be afraid of a bugger I wouldn't. I can understand that the kids call each other fart eaters and other childish names but when the adults call each other fart eaters as well I couldn't help but to think how juvenile it was. With all this in mind I still couldn't put the book down from the moment I started reading it because it truly is the best book I have ever read so when people say the book is childish they're not wrong in saying it but that doesn't make Enders Game any less of a book and it shouldn't affect you're decision on wether or not you should read the book.
078322804X|4.0|The red Pinto stationwagon launches majestically off a highway construction ramp into the clean morning air.  As Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries blares in the background, the car begins its impossible 15 second descent against the skyline of wakening Chicago.  The henchman passenger turns to Henry Gipson's character, the head of the Illinois Nazi Party, and says simply, \\"I've always loved you\\".  Moments earlier two men in black suits, hats, and sunglasses did a back flip in their vintage police car, traded for a mic, over that same Pinto and sped off.  Welcome to the world of the Blues Brothers.  The dispatching of the Nazis is perhaps my favorite part, the incredulous looks on their faces as they plummet, coupled with the sly nod to 2001 Space Odyssey as the foreground rushes past them.  Belushi's Jake, released from prison reunites with Aykroyd's Elwood.  Visiting their childhood orphanage home, they are informed that it needs $5000 in tax money or it will close.  Spurred on by a spiritual awakening, their `mission from God' sees them reuniting their blues band to play and come up w/ the money.  They slowly collect their prior band-mates, lifting them from their current dreary existences [lounge acts, fry cooks, etc.] while performing musical numbers with blues greats like James Brown, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, etc. Once reunited they play a couple gigs including the infamous cowboy bar.  Along the way they collect a not inconsiderable number of people who want them either dead or behind bars.  Departing the last gig, they have to get the money to the tax assessors dept. by mid morning.  This sets up one of cinema's greatest car chases.  The Blues Brothers features great music and nice pacing.  The DVD includes some scenes not available for some time that don't hinder the production.  While the Blues Brothers themselves are cartoons in their black suites; there is a moment of sweet humanity when Belushi takes off his glasses to plead for his life.  The film works on a variety of levels and is recommended.ks on a variety of levels and is recommended.
B00006F7IM|4.0|Years after this movie's release the Oakland A's defeated Red Sox in 12th inning with bases loaded bunt by catcher. That is what is so great about the movie...the baseball is grounded in realistic play and not artificial home runs as in the Natural.<br />Uecker and Gammons ( playing Manager Lou Brown) are terrific.<BR>&quot;Just a bit outside&quot; is now the classic comment for a really bad pitch.<br />Some of the voodoo stuff is overdone, but it is a fun movie
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Look, I don't have any gripes about the sound. I watched it in DTS last night and I thought it was great. Yes, the dialogue is rough sounding in some spots, but that's part of what makes the film what it is. I really wouldn't want Tony's opening scene to be crystal clear. It has the sound of an old noir movie from the 40's-- ya get it??<br />I think they didi an amazing job with the print &amp; the sound. Really a different experience than the first time I saw it cropped sliced and diced on VHS. The film just comes off 100% better when seeing it this way. Gives you a better appreciation of what DePalma was doing.<br />Two scenes on the top of my head that come off completely different than the old print: the bathtub scene &amp; the New York scene. Better, better, better.<br />Performances are all memorable -- Pfeiffer &amp; Mastrantonio particularly come off better in this edition. Bauer is great...And Pacino of course is legend now.<br />A lot of people have griped about Moroder's score, but I'm one of those that believes that the score is what lends the film its period authenticity. The only part that's a little cheesy for me is that Highway to the Danger Zone-esuqe montage with the beauty salon/wedding/tiger on a leash. I still can't stomach those few minutes- lol.<br />Although this movie received few accolades in its day, I believe it will be considered a true classic film. So many movies have been made in history, but only a few endure the test of time. This will be one of them. Like producer Matin Bregman said, it is the &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; of its day.<br />And for those of you who are still moaning about the 5.1 mix-- just take a toke and chill out. Enjoy, cause this is as good as it gonna get...
B0000C7PSW|2.0|I can only agree with the reviewer who stated how hard it must be to be &quot;Poor Little Miss Wainwright.&quot;  What a sad state of a man he has become ... a crack addict who feels that everyone must love him in order to help him feel whole.  This album seems to be one more example of an ongoing attempt to gain the attention he just never seemed to get from Daddy, who incidently is just so much more talented and together in his approach to his music.  The lyrics on this recent Rufus release are impossible to make out, the references to much better songs frustrating, and the constant whining just terribly annoying.  This album shows that, like with David Leavitt, too much success and attention is not a good thing for one's talent.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Yes ladies and gentlemen, this album is a symphonic masterpiece.<br />The long wait since the debut album pays off big dividends and leaves you pressing the replay button over and over.<br />It took several listens to really get the feel for the album, but I can tell you that the new fresh bass sound and masterful guitar work is just outstanding! And did I mention Maynard sure knows how to pen a tune. The album starts off with a nice crunky sound with &quot;The Package&quot; which starts off slow and mellow tempoed but picks up the pace at the end. Tunes like &quot;The Noose&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot; let you know that this album is gonna have a few hits and APC won't be falling off the face of the earth anytime soon. A must buy &quot;Album of the year&quot; is my evaluation!
B000002U9W|5.0|The record I'll choose if I was to take a single one on a desert island (my choice throughout the last 3 decades). To me, the relief and &quot;mindwash&quot; when I'm down. I don't see why some say it is conceptual. I think there's no common motif of the tracks (neither philosophically, nor musically - in contrast to the later albums of Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, Animals and Wall). Anyway, it is a collection of masterpieces. The 1st side of the original LP is occupied by the sole monumental A.H.M. suite (all group members being co-authors), side 2 is reserved to a more traditional song-writing by individual PF members.<br /><br />The A.H.M. suite cannot be compared to anything else I've heard. Although being so long, it attracts you from the very beginning to the very end. The sound backbone of the record is the essential sound of PF of the early 70's (already the typical sounds of the keyboards, David Gilmour's guitar, and notably, the accurate, sensitive and well recorded Nick Mason's drums), which is already devoid of the harmonies and arrangements used previously by Syd Barrett (I think the last LP on which we can musically trace Syd was Ummagumma - of course, the spiritual heritage of Syd remained, as quoted on Wish You Were Here). The typical feature of the A.H.M. suite are the contrasts of soothing harmonies and weird disharmonies, the contrasts of very calm, peaceful or contemplative parts with epical parts or even the slightly pompous finale (reminding of a happy-end of a drama). The contrasts are boosted by the incredibly sophisticated usage of the choir (wonderful voices so well corresponding to the sound) and horns. It is this unscrupulous ease of mixing the choir a brass arrangements (not at all trendy) with the rock'n blues backbone of PF's music that makes this album so outstanding and different to anything in PF's career. The next triade of the songs (side 2 of the original LP) are simply 3 more pearls. If is a quiet acoustic tune (sung in a rather frustated and shivering voice - asking &quot;If I go insane, please don't put your wires in my brain&quot; - ). Summer '68 is a decent Wright's nostalgy of the fast loves of the Hippie days, with brilliant keyboards. Fat Old Sun is a very fragile tune. The last track - Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast is well defined by its name. It employs some tapes of musique concrete (as we know it e.g. from Ummagumma). You can feel the exhaustion of the last night's trip, with the relief of the bacon crackling on the pan and the WC splash while the sun is rising.<br />I have never come accross anyone who'd dislike PF. However, this album is usually neglected by PF fans. Maybe it's because it is so strong, so extraordinaire, maybe less well-combed compared to the following albums. You make like it or not. I love it.a rather frustated and shivering voice - asking &quot;If I go insane, please don´t put your wires in my brain&quot; - ).

0192833588|1.0|I so much wanted to like Jane Austen and, specifically, this book.  That's because I dearly loved the movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" directed by Ang Lee with an amazingly good screenplay by Emma Thompson.  Now that I've attempted to read the book on which it was based, I'm all the more impressed by Emma Thompson because she extracted the story from this novel and told it via dialog and made it interesting, engaging and charming.<br /><br />So I have to credit Jane Austen, at least, with having invented the characters and their situation.  I've heard she was an astute observer of human beings and apparently she was.<br /><br />But her style!  Reading Jane Austen was for me like swimming through half-set concrete or undergoing a root canal.<br /><br />Mark Twain made two observations about Jane Austen.<br /><br />First, he wrote in \\"Remembered Yesterdays\\":  \\"Jane Austen?  Why I go so far as to say that any library is a good library that does not contain a volume by Jane Austen.  Even if it contains no other book.\\"<br /><br />Second, in a letter to his good friend William Howells, Mark Twain wrote in response to remarks Howells had made about Edgar Allan Poe:<br /><br />\\"To me his [Poe's] prose is unreadable -- like Jane Austin's [sic].  No -- there is a difference.  I could read his prose on salary, but not Jane's.  Jane is entirely impossible.  It seems a great pity that they allowed her to die a natural death.\\"<br /><br />I find Twain's prose eminently readable and agree with him about Jane Austen.  I can't read her prose and I couldn't even if I were paid to do it.<br /><br />I greatly admire those who can read Jane Austen.  I credit them with great patience and intelligence.  I'm not stupid, but my own gift of patience is utterly inadequate to the task.  Yes, I would put up the ongoing tedious annoyance of root canal to save a tooth, but when it comes to reading a novel, I can find no reason to put up with tediousness.  There are too many other novels written by authors whose style is both engaging and entertaining.<br /><br />I simply have to have sentences of prose that hold my interest and make me want to read the next sentence and then the next and the next until the book is done.  If after reading several sentences, I feel as though I've just endured a lengthy session of reconstructive dentistry, I just can't be bothered.<br /><br />It's probably not Jane's fault -- she was a product of her time and place and that's how they wrote back then.  If it makes Jane Austen fans feel any better, I'd put Nathaniel Hawthorne in the same category.  I've heard they were paid according to the number of words written, and if that is true, it would explain a lot.  But whatever the explanation, I understand completely Twain's hyperbole that she shouldn't have been allowed to die a natural death.
B00005JKG9|1.0|Sorry to be out of step here, but this movie is simply awful! Awful because, the \\"real thing,\\" the allegory for the Reagan Administration, the \\"evils of the free enterprise system,\\" wasn't real at all. There is no sales office on the planet where this type of \\"lead chaos,\\" language, mutinous and insubordinate talk, et al goes on - despite those who would like to ascribe the worst to business and business people. Baldwin's character is total BS; contests NEVER are Cadillac, then steak knives, then you're fired. Spacey's character is preposterous as it gets for a sales manager. The \\"second thoughts\\" buyer is a well-heeled idiot, and how many of those do you know? Using the \\"F Word\\" 500 times in a film does not make the dialog \\"gritty and real.\\" Yes, some of the performances were top notch, and yes, there ARE a great many abuses in business, we see that every day, unfortunately; but this is just nonsense on a big screen.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Sorry to say that I am not a big fan to Tolkien but I did read \\"Lord of The Rings\\" twice. Even by that I didn't effect by the \\"Tolkien Purist\\" fever.  I think these film are fantastic (I mean both, The Fellowship of The Ring and The Two Towers), to my point of view the part of Elves Army come to Helm Deep meant something to the audiences and I do believed that, most people felt the jolt of hope for the people of Rohan.  I do respect Peter Jackson, all cast and crew, they're worked so hard with pure determination to made these film come alive.  So, if it was not exactly like the book and then do not see it. No Producers or Directors in this world can satisfy the reader imagination, that's the fact.  I think even the most imaginative and open mind writer like Tolkien would be proud to these films. Praise them for what they did and what we cannot do.
B00005JM4Z|4.0|Fast paced with lots of action.  Way better than the first one.  Tyrese and Paul Walker have great chemistry together.  If you liked a movie like Cradle To The Grave you are going to love this.<br />*Wanted to give it 3 and a half stars not four.
0671004107|5.0|I read CONTACT long before seeing the movie and that gives one a different perspective than seeing the movie first. It is that rarest of works, science fiction popular with both scientists and readers. One detects the brilliant mind behind the prose giving us a work that is intelligent, probing and scientifically literate. Missing are space fights, dangerous aliens, gutter language, random acts of insanity, ESP,  invisibility - all so common in today's current crop. Instead, it is the story of a scientist drawn to the search for alien life despite opposition from both both scientific and lay communities. <br />Many scientists conclude that SETI is a waste; biologists in particular consider intelligence such a rare development (requiring incredibly special circumstances and literally billions of years to develop) that they despair of ever finding another species with which we can communicate.<br />On the other side, religions object that a search is against the &quot;will of God&quot; and fear that Earthly belief systems will be adversely affected if it is known that creation is not unique.   The real message is philosophical:  Humanity (to quote the movie heroine) is so small and so insignificant and so precious as seen against the background of the universal panorama. This conflict between science and religion is explored without being didactic. <br />He explains that science, unlike religion, never demands belief without proof, that its findings are always subject to change and challenge, and that it is an instrument that expresses our humanity in ways religion never can. Ellie's greatest epiphany is evoked by communion with the Universe, not with God.<br />The plot has been bandied about before but it is the masterful blending of character, story, theme and conflict that makes this particular saga so enthralling.  The movie necessarily differs from the book and while I miss the voyage of the five (and the rather incontrovertible proof that provides) the ending isnot only pleasing but satisfactory.  Every character seems almost perfect from the point of view of the book.<br />I have read this book more than once and discover new nuances h each time.  Dennis Overbye shares Sagan's spirit of discovery and humanity and any books by him are worth companions to this.
0156027321|3.0|I went along with all the hype surrounding this book after it won the Booker Prize and decided to give it a try. Although I sort of liked it, I certainly wouldn't read it again, and I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone buying it. It is an interesting read, but suffers from pacing problems, and isn't a good return on your time investment if you're already the wiser about it. The beginning starts slow, ramps up in like 10 pages to get you there in time for the boating accident, and then you're stranded in the middle of a sea of endless pages with Pi and his pet, until it crawls to its anti-climatic (and I suppose rather obvious) ending.    And while the plot has skiddled to a stop during that never-ending middle section, you ears are being endlessly tickled by this barrage of self-piteous despair in stereophonic sound from left and right page, and like I said, it goes on, and on, and on... Unbearable if you're like me, at least slightly-patience taxing if you're most other people.    The island/solitary survivor genre of fiction has a long and distinguished history, all the way back from Robinson Crusoe to the peerless Pincher Martin William Golding. You've really got to be pushing the envelope to attempt the genre, and I really didn't much of that going on here.     In conclusion? Borrow this book from a library and read it to get a sense of how much the Booker Prize has gone to the dogs lately. I suppose the Judges didn't have much of a choice. None of the other books were much better. Trust me, I read them all.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|Even though I never really seen the original 1969 version of \\"The Italian Job\\" with Michael Caine, this explosive 2003 remake is, hands down, the best crime film that I've seen since the 2001 remake of \\"Ocean's Eleven\\", especially since \\"The Italian Job\\" has suspense at every twist and turn, compelling and daring escapes, and excellent cinematography! The hard-edged direction of F. Gary Gray (\\"The Negotiator\\") was nothing short of excellent! The talents of Mark Wahlberg (\\"Planet of the Apes\\"), Charlize Theron (\\"The Devil's Advocate\\"), Edward Norton (\\"The Score\\"), Seth Green (The \\"Austin Powers\\" films), Jason Statham (\\"The Transporter\\", \\"Snatch\\"), Mos Def (\\"Brown Sugar\\"), and Donald Sutherland (\\"A Time to Kill\\") were top-notch, powerful, and commanding!<br />This remake of the 1969 film focuses on career criminal Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) and his team: computer expert Lyle (Green), wheelman Handsome Rob (Statham), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), and inside man Steve (Norton). Along with Charlie's mentor/veteran safecracker John Bridger (Sutherland), the team has successfully pulled off a daring heist at a heavily guarded palazzo in Venice, Italy. The prize: $35 million worth of gold bullion! After a clean getaway, Charlie and the crew experienced a threat that they never saw coming...a double-crosser! As it turns out, Steve just happened to be the double-crosser! And the end result: The death of John Bridger and leaving the rest of the team for dead as well! A year later, Charlie and the team find Steve in Los Angeles and they decide to get some long-awaited revenge, but they couldn't do it alone. This is where John Bridger's daughter, Stella (Theron), comes into the picture. Stella is an expert safecracker with nerves of steel like her father, and the murder of her father provides much of the drive for the conflict of the film. Stella reluctantly joins Charlie and the gang as they come up with a brilliantly smart and devious plan. The plan: To re-steal the gold by tapping into L.A.'s traffic control system and manipulate signals, thus creating one of the biggest traffic jams in L.A.'s history! Also included in the plan is that once they have reclaimed the gold, they can get away in their speedy, but versatile, Mini Cooper automobiles, which are small enough to drive on sidewalks so they can make a clean getaway before the massive traffic jam clears. Like Charlie says in the film, \\"We'll do it like the Italian Job.\\" Because you see, this isn't about the money. This isn't about payoff. It's about payback!<br />In conclusion, \\"The Italian Job\\" has lots of action, harrowing suspense, brilliant stuntwork, lots of surprises, and outstanding performances from a top-notch cast! This is, by far, a DVD must-have to your crime caper collection! If you love movies such as this, then look no further than \\"The Italian Job\\"!
B0000AR8NK|5.0|I'm surprised by the reviews here- especially the one where &quot;bowie will be playing county fairs&quot; and i've never met anyone who will admit that the 80s stuff was bowies best;)  <br />I'm blown away by this album- I came to it expecting something more like Heathen or Hours- something I could admit was good but just too depressing in my taste- but this album is so fresh!! its amazing! I'm totally blown away by bowie's  ability to be so innovattive!  There is nothing out there right now which sounds like this album- and yet the bowie vocals are deffinately his.  Its a rare treat to hear a new album from an artist that has a heavy back catalogue which is fresh and new and stands by itself.  <br />I love Fall Dog Bombs the Moon, New Killer Star, Never Get Old, Reality-- and now that i think about it- the only song that im NOT crazy about is The Lonliest guy.  <br />sure this album can't compare to Ziggy Stardust- but do we really want it to?  I like seeing muscians looking forwards instead of backwards- being able to maintain whatever it is that makes them great- but finding new ways to do that.<br />all and all- ignore the rest of the reviews and buy this album!
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Very good album featuring a broad spectrum of &quot;covers&quot; by artists as diverse as The Beatles, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, The Eagles and others as well as some rare originals and traditional folk tunes. Cash has always been more of a stylist (along the lines of Bob Dylan) rather than a great singer. He takes these diverse tunes and makes them his own. His rendition of Nine Inch Nail's &quot;Hurt&quot; sounds as if he has written a follow up to &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; Other songs reflect his country and folk background. He also harks back to his later religious period on tunes such as &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;. This album is a must have for fans of the late great man in black who appreciate the song writing talents of modern artists.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|Despite being a Star Trek fan, I would never bring myself to buying the bare-bones DVD Paramount originally offered for Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.  I had been hoping that Paramount would grant William Shatner's wish to redo the movie in the same fashion they allowed Robert Wise to redo Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  Sadly, they denied the request.  However, the extra disk in the Special Edition set boasts some of the best most candid interviews we've had from William Shatner and crew to date.<br />I actually understand now where Shatner was trying to go with this movie.  His original script concept was definitely thought-provoking and could have been brilliantly executed.  The Powers-That-Be at Paramount chopped his concept to pieces and we received a very watered down version of the original idea.  Shatner confesses that compromising on the script was truly his fatal error in directing/writing this movie.  Then, Paramount slashes the film's budget, so they could not get the special effects crew from ILM...hence the substandard special effects in this film compared to what had been previously seen.  Shatner had beautiful visions of how this movie would have proceeded, but without the budget or the original storyline, things really started to pale out of his control.<br />Unfortunately, Shatner admits that he used a lot of the film's already weak budget for the beginning and middle of the movie and was left with little to no money to shoot the finale...hence, we have a very lackluster unsatisfying sloppy ending to the feature.<br />Having discovered what was intended and dreaming of what could have been allows me to forgive this palid entry into the Star Trek film franchise.  This DVD set is a must own, just to understand what was going on and why this film failed.  Not to mention that there is some classic dialogue between the humorous trio of Kirk/Spock/McCoy that make the film worth viewing.<br />Give it a shot...
0754004546|5.0|Not only is this story light and frothy, it is also full of well written, funny characters. Kitty Charing is told by her step father, Mr.Pennicuik, to choose a husband from   his great nephews as a condition of her inheritance of his large fortune. As she had always been kept under his close supervision, she is determined to spend some time in London, trying her wings in Society before committing to a marriage and so forces Freddy, the most affable of the nephews to take her to stay with his married sister. It's a witty,funny story with a lot of charm and good humour.
B0000AZJXQ|1.0|I feel like every song, without exception, on this album falls short somehow.  They are all missing the climax associated with Maynard's previous endeavors (the endings of Orestes or Thomas come to mind, not to mention any of tool's epic opuses).  <BR>Don't get the wrong imprsesion from my rating, this album isnt THAT bad.  I gave 1 star to perhaps better lower the total average rating because I know there are too many people who would give 5 star ratings to anything with Maynard's name on it.  This album has potential but nothing stands out.  <BR>That being said, the most tolerable tracks are: The Noose, Blue, and Pet.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|WOW! Its like the first time but we are not exploring the same stuff... Fantastic for the rtistic mind... I found myself following new thought strings..... BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000B3FCX|2.0|I cant help but think Nickelback is losing their edge.  The State rocked, silver side up was ok and now The Long Road, apart from a couple of songs, just blows.  Sorry if anyone really liked this album (and I'm sure many did) but I cant find anything new or special about it.  It sounds like silver side up but worse.  Disappointed...
B00006J3WH|5.0|Joss Whedon is a genius!  That about sums it up.  He constantly amazed me with his directing and writing abilities with the \\"Buffy\\" series - and then he did the unthinkable and created an entire musical episode.  The show had me spellbound.  I enjoyed how the music was worked into the shows theme and storyline - but mostly I was amazed with some of the casts voices! My favorites characters on the show were Willow and Tara - I loved their relationship.  It was an honorable and realistic portrayal of a gay couple.  So, of course, my favorite song on this entire CD is \\"Under your spell\\".  Amber's voice is so wonderful, and the emotions that the lyrics speak just give me goosebumps.  I hope one day that someone will maybe sing such a song to me - or at least feel that way towards me!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The best iron maiden album so far.Best lyrics Best solos Best everything.
B000089RVR|2.0|Unfortunately, Dido like many other artists, for whatever reason, didn't stay with the production team and co-songwriters that helped her build &quot;No Angel&quot;. She should have called them in to help her create the new one. <br />&quot;Life for Rent&quot; lacks any strong melodic substance. Lyrically, I don't have much to criticize. However, there are few if any good 'hooks' that one might find oneself singing along to. Each song starts with a tone or feeling and generally stays at or on the same tone or feeling throughout the remainder of the song. I don't detect any sort of hunger or passion to move the tone in either a happy or sad direction: just a continual streaming of words about a subject. <br />Other than some new samples, musically the album didn't produce any songs anywhere near as captivating as &quot;Thank You&quot;, &quot;Here with Me&quot;, &quot;All You Want&quot;, &quot;Don't Slide&quot; or my favorite, &quot;Take My Hand&quot;.<br />I think that's the thing about this album I find most disconcerting: it really doesn't say anything in a passionate way; Nowhere near as passionately as &quot;No Angel&quot; did.<br />I see this so kind of thing happen a lot these days. Like with Sara McGlachlan's &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstacy&quot;, where producer Pierre Marchand helped Sara create one of the most passionate and polished albums I've ever heard; they made majic together. However, her next album wasn't anywere near as powerful. Granted, that next album was good. But no where near as good as the one she created with Pierre's supervision.<br />Dido in this case went off to find somebody else to help her write the music and a new production team. Well, I don't know if she got to pick her new production team but, somebody screwed up. I think they failed her, or, at least didn't do anything to inspire the passion that Pascal Gabriel helped her create with &quot;No Angel&quot;.<br />Never underestimate the power of a good producer! See where U2 made several BLAH albums before they returned to work again with Daniel Lanois. Took them years to learn the very same lesson.<br />Musically, melodically and emotionally, &quot;Life for Rent&quot; is a disappointment. Hopefully though, Dido (or her handlers) will search harder for a better producer or, maybe once again collaborate with Pascal Gabriel. Until then, this album is a snoozer. <br />Only good news is, Dido's beautiful voice is still there and wonderful for ambient background music. Other than that, wait until the next one or, maybe she'll light a fire with a live album.
B00000JHAU|5.0|If you just want to sit back, relax and listen to some nice music, then Belle &amp; Sebastian is your band.  They have great lyrics, but you might not notice them until after a few listens, because of their wonderful melodies.  This music is just feel good, make you hum later in the day, type of music.<br />Recommended.
B0000AMJED|5.0|I loved 2 fast 2 furious.  It's better than the first one (it's easier than you think to get over Vin leaving)...the cars are better, the location is better (you can't beat Miami)...Tyrese is great, and he adds a lot of comic value I didn't expect.<br />Much more exciting and fast paced than the first movie.  Better stunts too.<br />I looked at the DVD's extras last night...there was some pretty cool stuff, but the deleted scenes and outtakes aren't too interesting.  I liked watching Ludacris' making of his video, but they didn't have the actual video you could watch, which would have been nice.<br />So it's a great movie with some decent extras.
B00000AFHM|4.0|I think Belle &amp; Sebastian have the art of nice mellow songs down pat.  It's just something they can do very well.  They've basically found a groove like other bands (I'm thinking Cake, Stereo Lab, Pavement, etc.) and just try to perfect their sound based around a certain sound that they love.<br />I don't want this review to get too philosophical or off track; so, I'll just say that this album is really good mellow melody music with entertaining lyrics.  Nice listening for when you're in a contemplative mood.
B000089RVR|3.0|I seems that the production team on this album tried to strip away some of the supporting elements they used on No Angel.  The rich, complex sound of the songs on No Angel is not here.  White Flag is the closest to that sound.  I can see why they released that song as the first single.  It is the most likely to appeal to fans.  Most of the songs on Life for Rent have a pared down sound, reminiscent of My Lover's Gone from No Angel.  I felt the songs on Life for Rent sounded like rough drafts that hadn't been given full flesh yet.<br />Dido's sound has been compared to Sarah McLachlan.  Perhaps by simplifying the sound on Life for Rent they were trying to differentiate Dido from Sarah.  But to the true listener and fan, there are many disctinct differences.  Dido uses a more eclectic approach.  Sarah's classical training is clear to any who listens.  They are both amazing, but very different. <br />No Angel is one of my favorite albums.  The deep, rich melodic elements, sampling and diverse beats give No Angel lasting appeal.  Dido has a wonderful voice that echoes with spindling, breathy passion.  Rich, musical, structured sound props up her voice and gives it support.  Even the world's best sculpture needs an armature.  Dido, bring back the unique sound, expand, push the limits, don't pull back.<br />Reviewer: Victor A. Soares from Austin, TX USA sums it up nicely.<BR>  &quot;Unfortunately, Dido like many other artists, for whatever reason, didn't stay with the production team and <BR>co-songwriters that helped her build &quot;No Angel&quot;. She should have called them in to help her create the new one.&quot;<br />I eagerly await the next album.
B000084T18|4.0|Probably the most hyped debut from a rap artist since Snoop Doggy Dogg's 1993 smash debut Doggystyle. Though, 50 Cent isn't exactly a rookie, and in most people's eyes this isn't a debut record (see the unreleased Power of the Dollar [1999] and the Guess Who's Back? compilation [2002]). 50 Cent is no stranger to those who follow the New York mixtape circuit or happen to own a bootlegged version of 50's unreleased debut for Columbia. Most fans of 50 Cent's Get Rich Or Die Tryin' weren't down with the underground either via the streets of N.Y.C. or the bandwidth of cyberspace hip-hop. The expectations for 50's &quot;debut&quot; were huge, it was so massive that the expectations overshadowed the music itself. Get Rich or Die Tryin' doesn't fall into the long list of hardcore rap (NYC) classics like Illmatic, Ready To Die, The Infamous, Reasonable Doubt, Enter The 36 Chambers, and Doe or Die, it was intended for the charts, and was produced &amp; arranged club ready. Eminem produces two of the tracks here, and Dr. Dre gives you four, while John &quot;J. Praize&quot; Freeman produces &quot;Wanksta&quot; and Rockwilder, Rob Tewlow, and Mike Elizondo handle the rest. 50 has the makings of a street legend, and it's no secret, Get Rich isn't the masterpiece that Jackson is capable of making.
B00005A3KS|5.0|This is probably the greatest movie of all time.  Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze face off with such intensity, charisma, and chemistry that you'd think that these roles were written for them eons ago by gods up on Mt. Olympus.  Well, dude, they were.<br />Although Point Break is fascinating on many levels, it works extremely well as a metaphor for the Cold War.  Bodhi and his gang represent the Soviet Union, who threaten the United States (Johnny Utah) with their liberating ideology of robbing banks to finance an endless summer.  As a parallel to Marxist revolution as it generally existed in the Third World, Bodhi's anti-establishment surf rhetoric was indeed backed up by force--his goon Rosie represents the Red Army, or the KGB or something.<br />Johnny Utah is quite effective as the United States, going to any extreme (learning to surf, etc.) in order to crush his enemy.  Interestingly enough, however, Johnny gets a little bit \\"too deep\\" with Bodhi's gang, and for awhile mirrors the Carter administration's policy of peaceful coexistence with socialist sattelites (Nicaragua).  This doesn't last for long, however, when Gary Busey's Pappas (Ronald Reagan) convinces Johnny that he needs to bust the ex-presidents.<br />Tyler (Lori Petty) plays the unfortunate role of the victimized Third World.  The two superpowers, Bodhi and Johnny, are forced to use her as a \\"proxy battlefield\\" in order to avoid the mutually assured destruction that would certainly happen if they met head on.<br />In the end, the overwhelming force of Utah's defense spending (the FBI budget vs. Bodhi's crumbling Marxist/Bank Robbery economy) forces the ex-presidents to break up, and Bodhi dies a death that is infinitely more poetic and beautiful than that of the USSR. Thank You.
B00008X5J5|5.0|This movie is spectacular! yeah Walt Disney knew what he was doing when he made this movie! man. Ya know, I almost think that this is the best movie that Walt Disney ever made! but there are a few nit picky things that bother me about this movie, nothing major by all means, but what I am talking about is Phillip, now I think that Philip is alright for who he is but, the thing that I am knawing on is the fact that Phillip doesn't have like a ponytail or a mullet of some kind, like beauty and the beast, another great movie by Walt Disney, but what I like so much about beauty and the beast is that like all the men have Ponytails, that is how the hairstyles were back then, I mean like this movie takes place basically the same time as beauty and the beast, and notice the difference in the hairstyles between the two movies, I mean if there were more guys that had ponytails in this movie, alright all of the guys had ponytails, this would be the movie that I would like most of all by Walt Disney, but just that little detail can change everything, I mean it is sad that only kind Steppen is the only cool dude with the, I don't know rather he has a mullet or a ponytail but either way, I think you know that I am a fan of long hair. Okay I will stop harping on the hairstyle thing, one of my most favorite charectors in this movie is like not in this movie but like 45 seconds but, the servant dude that plays the gutar and gets drunk on Hubert's &quot;drinkage&quot; Man he is rightous, what really makes me laugh is when Hubert toasts to the wedding and king Steppen pushes the bottle away to where it is spilling on the flour and the servant dude puts his gutar under it making sure that King Hubert can't see him and he sits behind the table and falls over while drinking the wine, man I love the sound of that drunk hiccup that he makes as he is falling underneith the table, he rules man!. Now lets talk about my dream girl, yeah thats right the protagonist, Briar Rose, aka Arora, the way I will explain her is a line that comes from the movie con air, specifically from duncan malloys mouth: Sunsets are beautiful, new born babies are beautiful, she, she is spectacular! well it isn't word for word, but for the most part it is, anyway, she is everything I dream of for a girlfriend, spectacular, blonde, kind to everyone, man she is like the ultimate image for my dream girl, every single detail, nothing included nothing excluded, just the way she is in this movie. One more thing that bugs me about this movie is that they have a newer music group play at the end of this movie, what is it's name, oh yeah, no secrets now that isn't really the group that I would have picked for the end of this movie, the group that I would have picked for this movie is Huey Lewis and the news and I would have played Do you Believe in love, or a song by Pete Townshend and the song is called let my love open the door man both of those songs would work out great for this movie but all I can say is thank goodness it wasn't Britany Spears, I am not saying that she is ugly by any means but she is a bad influence, and I don't think that I have to mention what she and madonna did on that stage, I think that everyone knows what happened there, she is just wacked out in my opinion but yeah, anyway, I think that this movie is narley for the most part. I have some advice for those of you who have not seen it yet, it is a great movie and it is worth the time it takes to watch it all the way through, man you won't be sorry!
0316666343|5.0|The first time I noticed this book was actually when I was at a Borders Books in CA.  I read the summary on the back of the cover, and wanted to pick it up right away and start reading it.  However, I chose to wait and when I went into my college reading class, I found out it was highly reccomended by several people so I went out and bought it.  I can't even put it into words how incredible it was.  And it's not just that, the way it was written so well with the details and the point of view was awesome.  It is for a more mature reading audience though.  However this book contains suspense, betrayal, and drama.  If you want a good read, pick this book up.  I with out a doubt give it five stars.

B0000BYM3K|3.0|I was a bit dissapointed when I first heard DoD. I kept listening to it over and over hoping for those catchy maiden riffs. I did however find them somewhat in track 2,8,&amp; 10. I was expecting alot more from a maiden album. DoD is something I would have expected with Blaze Bailey. I do however remain a dedicated maiden fan.
B000003RCY|5.0|As a big fan of their album &quot;Mutter&quot; and a fan of their album &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; i thought i would get this to complete my Rammstein studio album collection. Once i listened to this album over 20 times i spotted a big difference in this album to their other albums. I found that this album was their heaviest, rawest, fastest, energetic and most memorable album, and i also noticed that singer Till Lindeman sang less and talked more on this album then his previous albums which i don't know if that is a bad thing or not. Rammsteins genre in my oppinion would be a mix of Heavy Metal, Alternative Metal, Industrial Metal and Progressive Metal and their tones are to me sound Menacing, Ominous, Gloomy, Nihilistic, Malevolent, Thuggish, Aggressive, Brooding, Angry, Hostile.<br />This album contains many standout tracks like &quot;Du Reichst So Gut&quot; an extremely energetic, catchy song which will have you singing along to it in no time, &quot;Weisses Fleisch&quot; another energetic, catchy song which will have you singing along to it, &quot;Laichzeit&quot; another one of their standout tracks which has some of the keyboardist best work, and again this is another catchy, energetic, fun to sing along to song. The only filler track is &quot;Rammstein&quot; which is just stupidly repetitive and boring, i don't care if it has a great message or its their title track it just plain sucks.<br />Positives: Extremely high replay value, catchy, extremely unforgettable, perfect for any mood, many standout tracks, only 1 filler track.<br />Negatives: Till's voice isn't very good when compared to his other albums, 1 filler track.<br />Album ratings: Mutter: 4.75 Sehnsucht: 4.25 (this album): 4.5/5<br />Hope this helped.
B000089CJI|5.0|I really like this CD. It has such great lyrics that really hit home.  I needed a new CD to help me get through a break up and this was perfect.  My favorite song is District Sleeps Alone Tonight. It is beautiful.  <br />This man has the most beautiful words...  this CD has some of the most romantic songs I've ever heard.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Being argueably the biggest and most eccentirc Soundgarden fan who has ever lived, and being close to that mentality with RATM, upon hearing of the once named \\"Civilian\\" project now known as \\"Audioslave\\", I couldn't help but wet my pants in anxiety of an albums release. Of course, I had some reservations as to whether the parts would quite sum up to the whole, we all know many, if not most, supergroups leave the stage with applause from only hardcore fans, and bottles of piss thrown at them - like Justin Timberlake on stage with the Stones at the SARS benefit in Toronto - from the rest.     Upon hearing the album. I will admit, its not quie as good as Soundgarden, but definately better than RATM - solely because De La Rocha has very little musical talent outside of rap, just Marxist 'rage' which in no way complimented his coleagues' understated talent. He's good, but one-dimensional. I will also agree that, yes, some aspects of each members' former groups' influences do exist on the album, but not so much as to call it  \\"Rage Garden\\" or \\"Sound Machine\\" (though that's a catchy little number...), but what do you expect? I doubt they were thinking \\"...let's give our band a \\"Savage Garden\\" sound...\\" (whom by the way is a debochery of the word garden in any sense - they are not beautiful flowers, just fairies, and by no means should be compared to Soundgarden, even if it is just the word).    In this attempt, Cornell's voice has aged like a fine wine, Morello has found new ways to arouse one's ear to new sounds (the solo on \\"Shodow on the Sun\\" nearly brought a tear to my eye the first time i heard it), and Tim and Brad, as always, great at what they do - hold a dynamic rhythm.     After having read everyone's reviews, I felt the need to write this because I feel our society has reached a new low in their taste in music. You all should re-evaluate the album after you put away your \\"Duran-Duran\\" and pull out \\"Superunknown\\"  and  \\"Down on the Upside\\" for a listen, for you have been brainwashed to hate phenominal music. And to Josheph D Smith who wrote a review on the first page, you shuold seek professional help, I don't think your quite right in the head. Cornell has definately not \\"ruined anotner album\\" - quite the contrary, he is one of  the most influential singer/songwriter/musicians of this era.     I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your souls.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|As fine as this DVD surely is, for me the great miracle of this enterprise is that after 65 years, the separate dialogue and music tracks still survived, making the audio restoration far easier to pull off.  I compared the video and audio of the DVD with the print on my VHS tape and the print which aired on cable channel Turner Classic Movies (TCM) just the night before the DVD release.  These unrestored videos were grayer in color and obviously scratchy, but the sound was so bad I nearly needed subtitles.  The new DVD displays audio and a picture of such clarity, I was bowled over by it.  For the first time, I could actually hear crisp \\"s\\" sounds in the voices, and background noises, such as twittering birds and running water in the Sherwood Forest sequences.  I was also glad to hear the cymbals in the orchestra track for a change, which help to make Korngold's magnificent score all the more heroic.  A true success in every respect.  Highly recommended!
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is an absolute masterpiece of an album.  The level of songwriting and musicianship displayed throughout the record makes almost all popular music out there today look absolutely irrelevent.  The tracks that especially standout on this album, such as &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot;, &quot;Go to Sleep&quot;, &quot;Where I End and you Begin&quot;, and &quot;There There&quot;, are just absolute works of genius and easily hold their own against the best moments on OK Computer, The Bends, and Kid A.  Don't be fooled by the ignorant consumers on this web page who insist this record is &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;experimental noodling&quot;.  People who gave this album anything less than 4 stars should stick with Creed, Staind, Saliva, Korn, Matchbox Twenty, and all the other forgetable corporate rock out there.  If you want challanging, emotionally and sonically complex music, pick this CD up.  Given the inherently complex nature of the music, it may take four or five listens before the true genious of this album comes through.  If you aren't patient enough to listen to the record more than once or aren't intelligent enough to understand the music after you have listened to it more than a few times, than go buy some nu-metal or emo garbage.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|good album.......... three best songs are Rainmaker, Dance of Death, and Pachendale. Rainmaker is the the song that grabs your attention first, I don't why Maiden released Wildest Dreams as the single. I thought the production quality wasn't quite as good as brave new world..... the music sounded a little muffled.

B00006ZCFH|3.0|I am a true Erykah Badu fan.  However, this CD is not here best work.<br />1-She makes us wait almost 3 years for an album and only gives us 10 songs!  2 of which are intro and outro<br />2-The weird sounds are okay, but one song has 5 minutes of weird sounds!!!!<br />3-An R&amp;B singer should never, ever, ever do rap songs. Maybe every orange moon would be okay but she has two rap songs on her her small album! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO.................
B00004X0Q0|5.0|First of all, I have not been a fan of At the Drive-In very long. I first checked them out this past summer. Despite the fact that they are now defunct, I find them to be energizing at the most. My friend let me borrow and copy this CD. I've fallen in love with it. Its got such a great beat when i play it. The lyrics are hard hitting and just really deep.<br />If i had to choose any songs on this record the number one song would be One Armed Scissor. That's just an awesome song. Invalid Litter Dept is good too, and so is Pattern Against User. Very good CD. I recommend you buy it if you enjoyed Rage Against teh Machine. excellent.<br />later
B0000B3FCX|5.0|This album is unreal!  It is the best nickelback cd yet.  I cant stop listening to it. One good song after another.  I put it in my car and i just let it play over and over.  Awesome work!
B00001QGPS|4.0|Redman is known as one of the funniest, craziest, most clever lyricists in the game.  Method Man can hypnotize people with his smooth, confident flow, and is the (commercial) star of the Wu-Tang Clan.  We can expect nothing less than a great album.  I actually expected a little more from two such accomplished artists, but this CD leaves little room for complaint.<br />The rhymes are all good.  Both artists have similar senses of humor and clever rhymes throughout.  Redman is actually the better lyricist in my opinion, but I still prefer Meth because of his voice and flow.  Red and Meth compliment eachother well that way.  The switch between Meth's mellow voice and Red's thick one adds variety, as do the differences in their flows.  They have a lot of different types of flows on here to match with the different beats.  On DJ Scratch's &quot;1 2 1 2,&quot; they have a brisk, on-point flow.  On &quot;Blackout!&quot; their flows are more up-beat and energetic.  On &quot;Cereal Killer,&quot; it's more dark and sneaky.  The way they switch up their styles to match the different beats is one of the things that makes this album great and helps the songs stand out.<br />The lyrical content itself is good and bad.  Red and Meth are funny and clever, no question, but they couldn't make a serious-sounding track if their lives depended on it.  None of their songs are about anything.  Even though their verses are good, they start to run together a little bit.  Their lines are better in some songs than others.  There's nothing truly wack on here, but not very many stand-out tracks either.  &quot;Cereal Killer&quot; is kind of narrating a story, so that one is nice, but for the most part it's easy to lose track of the lyrics from one song to the next, even with dope lyricists like these.<br />The collaborations were alright, could have been better.  LL Cool J has a nice verse in &quot;4 Seasons.&quot;  Ja's needed work.  Street is good, but Ghostface's verse in &quot;Run 4 Cover&quot; doesn't make any sense.  There aren't all that many collabs, which I think is a good thing.<br />The production is pretty nice.  Half is done by Erick Sermon, and the other half has several different producers.  &quot;Blackout!&quot; is a punchy, tropical-sounding beat that makes a nice opener.  &quot;Mi Casa&quot; has a really nice vibe to it, and is one of my favorite songs with both the beat and the lyrics.  &quot;YOU&quot; and &quot;4 Seasons&quot; sounded the same to me at first, but they grew on me.  &quot;Cerial Killer,&quot; courtesy of the RZA, is dark and spooky and a little bit goofy, which creates a near perfect effect.  &quot;Da Rockwilder,&quot; obviously produced by Rockwilder, has a kind of smooth futuristic effect that can get anybody nodding their head.  The DJ Scratch beat for &quot;1 2 1 2&quot; is just like the rhymes...brisk and on-point.  &quot;Run 4 Cover,&quot; another RZA track, is way different from his other track.  It has a more intense, sinister feel.  &quot;The ?,&quot; produced by Redman himself, is dark and sublte, in the same vein as &quot;Cereal Killer.&quot;  &quot;Cheka&quot; is loud and bouncy.  Those were the standouts in my opinion.<br />Overall, Red and Meth made a great album.  It's too bad they didn't make a classic, but this is one I haven't regretted buying at all.  Some of it caught my ear at once, other parts grew on me, but it's all good.  <br />Closing Comments: They should make another one.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I got hooked on this series in Season 2, and had not seen almost any of season 1.  All I can say is that my husband and I watched it all in about 3 evenings, and we're dying for season 2 to come out on DVD as well!!
B00009Y3S9|1.0|I had a hard time concentrating on the movie - I kept wondering if she had just one long eyebrow or if she connected the two she had with a pencil.  Nobody else in the movie had eyebrow(s) like that.  I didn't know anything about Frida but I did learn who she was; her paintings were eerie and I just did not enjoy anything about the movie.

0767827902|5.0|The Last Picture Show is one of the best films that I have ever seen.  When it first premired in 1971, it garnered both praise and critism, mainly because of the sexual content in it's stories.  But don't stress about that, it's really nothing bad at all, especially for today's standards(nothing close to Monster's Ball), remember The Graduate caused an explosion too in 1967.<br />Adapted from the Novel by Larry McMurty(Lonesome Dove, Terms of Endearment)and directed to PERFECTION by Peter Bogdanovich, the takes place in fall 1951-fall 1952 in the dying, small town of Anarene, Texas.  It includes some of the best characters in a film ever, and the acting by all is simply EXQUISITE.  The film mainly follows two best friends, Sonny(Timothy Bottoms) and Duane(Jeff Bridges-in a supporting actor academy award nominated role),in their senior year in high school.  Both are begining to get to a time of change and crossroads in their lives.  Duane's girlfriend Jacy(Cybill Shepherd-in her wonderful film debut) is the girl who both boys have their eyes on.  While Jacy is taken, Sonny starts an affair with the coach's wife(Cloris Leachman-Best Supporting Actress Academy Award), this gets the story rolling.  The three women in this film are simply magnificent.  Ellen Burstyn was, in a word, wonderful & she was my favorite character, and garnered a Supporting Actress Nomination(she won Best Actress in 1974). Cloris Leachman beat her out for the Oscar that year.  Her character changes so much from being meek and quite, to being filled with joy, to being full of anger & in the final moment's of the movie she shows why she has that Oscar.  Eileen Brennam is superb as Genevieve the waitress, she serves as a mother-figure for Sonny, and is tough-talking but sincere.  One of the Most Memorable roles in the Film is that of Sam the Lion(Ben Johnson),the all-knowing wise man, who owns the picture show.  THe scene by the Lake is Classic.  THis role won him the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award.<br />  The film is shot in black-and-white, which adds to the feeling of depression and gives the lonely dying feeling that the town evokes.  The music is true to the time, and is also part of the movie.  It only comes from a radio or record player, no background music.<br />  People with \\"country\\" roots will especially like this one as will those who like to study films, this one is one of the most importants of all time.  It was also nominated for Best Picture, director, and Adapted-screen play too(8 nominations in all).<br />  Check it out, it's important and entertaining.Award. <BR>          The film is shot in black-and-white, which adds to the feeling of depression and gives the lonely dying feeling that the town evokes.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|OK, I am aware of all the negative reviews this movie received when it was released. It certainly seemed as if the movie fell flat of many people's expectations. I must say, however, this movie more then met my expectations. Let me try to explain why this, deep down, is really a fantastic movie. First of all, I think I know why many people had a problem with this movie. It's the second part of a trilogy, therefore, I doubt anybody went to see this movie without expecting it to be very similar to the first movie. However, this one is very different than the first movie. I think after seeing that, many people did not view it as it's \\"own\\" movie. If you view this movie as it's \\"own\\" movie, you may really enjoy it. It has every element needed. It has a fantastic story-line (very complex towards the ending), amazing action, and a killer cliffhanger ending. Yes, I will admit, there are one or two scenes that could have hit the cutting room floor, but come on! Almost every movie in creation has scenes like that. I am also confused as to why there was so much complaint over the length of the fight scenes. They are nearly the same style as the ones in the first movie. If people loved those so much, wouldn't it be better if we got to see more of them like we do in this movie??? Well, if there's one thing I would like anyone who reads this review to take away from it, I want it to be for everyone to see this movie with a very open mind. View it as a movie on it's own right and terms, and remember... it's science fiction!!! Don't expect \\"Gone With the Wind\\". So, buy this DVD when it is released, and just HAVE A GOOD TIME!!!
0312319517|5.0|Frederick Forsyth's sabbatical from thriller writing has been too long - and now, thankfully, he is back writing again and giving us first class thriller fiction. What is interesting about him is that he is unaffected, unlike lots of his rivals, by the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989. He has continued to be up to date and relevant in his thrillers. OK so they are not world class literature but we can't be reading Dickens all the time and for what they are Forsyth's novels are great. He is a massive improvement on the rather formulaic Tom Clancy and since Forsyth's politics are way way to the right of most people it is great that he has concentrated now instead of getting back to giving us all excellent holiday reading. Welcome back Forsyth  -  it is good to see you in print at what you do best again! Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)
B000002AZ8|5.0|When you think of Pearl Jam you automatically think of their albums &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;V.S.&quot; just because they both did extremely well and contained majority of their hits. But what some people fail to realize is that Pearl Jam can actually have a better album than &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;V.S.&quot;. Yes it's true, this is Pearl Jam's best album. When you listen to it from the very beginning you hear nothing but pure hard rock and a fine tribute to Neil Young, especially with the song &quot;Not For You&quot; (greatest song). I mean look at what your offered with this album; &quot;Last Exit&quot;, &quot;Spin the Black Circle&quot;, &quot;Not For You&quot;, &quot;Tremor Christ&quot;, &quot;Corduroy&quot;, &quot;Satan's Bed&quot;, and of coarse their sweet ballads of &quot;Nothingman&quot;, &quot;Better Man&quot;, and &quot;Immortiality&quot;. I think this is their only album that they really branched out on, with real hard rock influences, and the showmanship of creating a great dark album of theirs. This album doesn't contain the enormous amount of hits but rather contains the raw alternative rock. If I were to compare it to any album that was ever created I would I have to say that it relates to Neil Young's &quot;Ragged Glory&quot; (go hear it! because if it wasn't for this album some of the Seattle bands probably wouldn't have created such beautiful music). But you can tell that after listening to this album they felt really comfortable with their music because every song flows extremely well and I don't think they were really pressured to get this album done that quickly, so I think they felt really good about it.<BR>Granted, this album can't compare to album sales of their first two albums, but &quot;Vitalogy&quot; just contains much more energy and rocking out motives. Oh! you will love it! Trust Me, it's vital!
B00006CXXU|5.0|With Christina Aguilera's three-year break over, she has come back with a vengeance and isn't hinting any means of slowing down. The new album appropriately titled, \\"Stripped\\" shows the new artist that has submerged. Leaving the three-time Grammy award bubble gum pop queen persona behind and looking forward on what really shaped her to the women and artist that she is today. <BR>Christina's new album \\"Stripped\\" is a well-balanced album that doesn't fall far from the classic tree. With a balance of emotions that take over the entire album and slashing the over played and over use of the subject of love. With the four songs that have been released from the  album are key elements that make up the album. \\"Dirrty\\" is a party anthem that was first released from the album and one of the bittersweet highlights of her career and shows the scandalous transition from the \\"Genie\\" to the X-tina. \\"Beautiful\\" Is another anthem that applies to all, and is a microcosm of what a huge portion of the CD is made of. Listing to, \\"The Voice Within\\" and to, \\"Soar\\" and to keep on \\"Singing My Song\\" while becoming a \\"Fighter\\" are all songs of inspiration and inner strength and learning from the past to become a survivor. Christina Aguiera did dab the CD with a few songs of love. From the seep roots of \\"Infatuation\\" to the deep lyrics of love in \\"Loving me for Me\\" and \\"Impossible\\" that deals to the troubles that love can bring and feeling \\"Underappreciated\\" and not letting people try to, \\"Make Me Over\\" but while you, \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" which is all that more dirtier and sexier that \\"Dirrty\\" All of the songs are diverse in emotions, but the way that they are portrayed musically in the diverse genres of musicality are amazing. Hip-hop, R&amp;B, Soul is portrayed through many of the songs. But the most chilling song and most powerful is \\"I'm OK\\" It is very chilling and you must buy the album to hear it. All in all this is an awesome album that deserves monstrous props a job well done to Christina.
B000050HTO|5.0|This is a great collection for the Dylan afficionado!  Granted, there are a few omissions for any 'Dylan retrospective' to be complete, but given this man's vast catalog, this CD collection is quite ample.  Another current singer/songwriter from the Dylan, Chapin, and Cat Stevens school is the ultra-fantastic 28 year old talent from New Jersey, Steven Delopoulos.  You've got to check out his solo CD called 'Me Died Blue'.  It is a veritable singer/songwriter MASTERPIECE!!!  Anyway, long live Dylan.  It's great to see he is still cranking out the music these days!
0380018179|5.0|Having been a long-time fan of The Thorn Birds mini-series on TV, I finally got around to reading the book.  And am I very glad I did.  McCullough's prose provides readers with an incredible amount of background of both Australia and the characters that no movie could ever match.  The book delves into the minds of many of the main characters, giving readers a better sense of their inner-selves, what makes each of them tick. Perhaps the best insight focuses on Father Ralph de Bricassart and Meggie Cleary.  Ralph's battle between loving God and Meggie is explored in a manner that makes his anguish truly believable.  Likewise, Meggie's anger at God for withholding from her the men sho loves most is detailed in a way that readers can identify with her plight, too. Information of the true character of hardened, undemonstrative Fiona Cleary, Meggie's mother, is trickled into the plot throughout the entire book.  Meggie's children, Justine and Dane, allow the plot to progress to it's expected, bittersweet ending.  The Drogheda sheep station is another important character, providing the characters a stable home they can always come back to.  Which they all do, time and again.  A strong cast of secondary characters adds to the real-life quality of this sad tale. This book is a true modern classic and a must read for anyone who loves lengthy, well-written historical fiction.
B00005JMD3|2.0|The star of this mildly entertaining action Colin Farrell admits that he decided to be in it because of Sam Jackson's participation.  And \\"S.W.A.T.\\" opens with hostage situation just like another Sameul L Jackson film \\"The Negotiator.\\"  Then you realize that director of \\"S.W.A.T.\\" Clark Johnson has not the same skill to show the tension F Gary Grey successfuly did.  <br />Actually, \\"S.W.A.T\\" is quite entertaining, but what it shows in 2 hours can be seen in such better movies as I mentioned.  There are gun-shots, hard training, friendship and so on, but all of them are thrown into a rather stretched running time of the film that looks like one extended episode of TV cop drama.  And you know that \\"S.W.A.T\\" is a remake of 70s TV series, and Clark Johnson is known as actor in TV's \\"Homicide\\" (as Detective Lewis), some of which are directed by him.<br />The story has potential.  Arrested drug king Tom Cruise-lookalike Olivier Martinez (\\"Unfaithful\\") states before the gathering TV cameras that he will give $100 million to anyone who succeeds in freeing him from the police.  Many greedy guys rejoice in their prospective fortune, and put their makeshift plans into practice.  Interesting, to be sure.<br />But the film, to reach the boiling point, takes too much time.  It looks as if we have seen two one-hour TV episodes, one ending with \\"TO BE CONTINUED,\\" and then are plunged into real actions.  So those who love helicopters and shooting have to fidget for a while, waiting for the actions to kick start.<br />And actions.  They are not bad at all.  In fact, they are competently staged, but nothing unique or innovative.  Some dialogues (including self-referential ones) are interesting, and Sam and Colin give good acting, but they are just standard-issue ones.  You know Sam Jackson's best is not this one (where is Kevin Spacey?)<br />You also see Josh Charles, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, Brian Van Holt, and Michelle Rodriguez, politically correct casting, but they have little todo, nor to surprise us.  Like I said before, it's TV origin is, in that sense, too obvious, and that makes the movie version of \\"S.W.A.T.\\" looks like a real pedestrian actioner.  Still, it's a great theme song.
0375422307|5.0|This book is essential reading to help us understand today's world from the perspective of an ordinary person. Iran is one of the most important, pivotal countries in the world today - and the more we know about that nation the better (especially if it really has nukes....) The writer's story mirrors that of many of the Iranian exiles I know personally and is therefore a great help in understanding a nation that we all need to know far more about.

B00001OH7P|5.0|Easily the most consistent album by one of the most inconsistent artists I've ever heard - that probably sounds negative and in a way it is, but it's also a testiment of Bowie's constant experimentation in alternate forms of music, which is commendable. <BR>I'm a huge Bowie fan and own several of his albums. This is one of the few of his albums that I can listen to all the way through without becoming side-tracked. Every song is very listenable and you don't necessarily have to be a Bowie fan to appreciate them. I would definitely recommend this album for those of you just starting to get into the whole Bowie legend. Other recommended albums would be Heroes, Hunky Dory, Station to Station, Scary Monsters, and Let's Dance - though they're not quite as consistently brilliant as this album.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This is definately the best CD I have bought in a long while. All of his songs have their own feeling to them, and they straddle a few different genres of music. His music is one of a kind. I'd say if you like Jack Johnson, John Mayer, Howie Day, or anyone like them, you will love this CD! He is a dynamic new artist, and will without a doubt be a big star very soon!
B0000033TE|5.0|I've been a fan of ELP since I first heard Tarkus in the early '70s. Saber rattling, aggressive rock-n-roll. ELP was at the forefront of progressive rock, blending classical, jazz and rock in a frantic keyboard driven fusion. ELP's music is more complex than any other rock band I am aware of. ELP was not only complex in the scope of the music, but often used complex 5/4 and 7/4 time signatures, which only jazz great Dave Brubeck and classical composers would dare use. They are as dark as Pink Floyd could ever be and just a touch more complex and grand in scope than the best work by Yes. And they manage to make this amazing music, which at times has the scope and feel of a whole symphony, with only three musicians and without any overdubs.    Brain Salad Surgery is, in my opinion, a bit more commercial sounding and formulaic than ELP's first four albums; however, it is arguably their best album. The highlights of the album are the three \\"impressions\\" of \\"Karn Evil 9\\" and \\"Tocotta,\\" an adaptation of Argentinian composer Alberto Ginastera's 1st Piano Concerto. The dark influence of Peter Sinfield's is apparent in \\"Karn Evil 9.\\" (Sinfield was given credit for \\"words and illumination\\" on King Chrimson's album \\"In the Court of the Chrimson King.\\") \\"Tocotta\\" is a tour-de-force both for Emerson and for Karl Palmer, whose lightning fast drum solo is used to key synthesizers.     With this release, they include a bonus track called \\"The Making of Brain Salad Surgery\\" consisting of interviews with the band.    Regretably, it is not on a second CD with other \\"bonus\\" materials.  Unlike the music, I have no desire to listen to this track more than once, and then only out of curiosity.  So, I am left to ponder the unusual, possibly schitzophrenic, mentality of the POWERS THAT BE in the music industry, because no one else in their right mind would fill up the rest of an album of great music with an interview.  I'd have preferred bonus music!    If you have a DVD player, I highly recommend purchasing this album on the DVD-Audio version, they also throw in Lucky Man from the first ELP album, and the sound quality is incredible.
B00008X5J3|2.0|The story line is most non-existant and what little there is is hard to follow.  It cuts in and out of reality and musical fantasy, now time and then time to the point where you are never sure just when you are or what's going on.  However, the music is hot.  My recomendation? Buy the music CD.
0385504209|5.0|Wow! I really enjoyed this novel. Not only did it appeal to my interest in ancient symbolism, but it kept me riveted the entire time I read it.<br />Brown is a masterful story teller who clearly intends to educate readers on the origins of &quot;the mysteries&quot; while fully engaging our attention. I personally love books that have meaningful depth and character, and am impressed that his references are so accurate and well researched.<br />Well done! I highly recommed this one!
B000066HI4|5.0|I came across Will Oldham from Bjork's website and was expecting something of her nature.  What I found was a creativity of the same magnitude, but in an entirely different direction.  'I See A Darkness' is most likely one of the most baring and darkening songs I've heard in ages, and one I can't just listen to once.  'A minor place' is an undiscovered gem leading off the album that should get more attention than it does.  Quite an album to get a first impression from
B00009V7T2|5.0|Mars Volta restore to life the best of the dark forces of seventies prog-rock in a ridiculously silly and utterly fantastic, overblown album that will come to be appreciated for its genius before too long (reviewers below are already there). The Guardian says it conjours up images of men in cloaks and small-scale models of stonehenge, which it does, but even as they hovers in Spinal Tap country, Mars Volta do for music what the Beastie Boys did for Mullets. This album changes everything!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; shows the lives of four characters and their addictions. It is summertime in Coney Island, NY and there is a sweet and lonely widow named Sarah Goldfarb ( Ellen Burstyn)that lives by herself. Her favorite TV game show is hosted by Tabby Timmons (Christopher McDonald). Sarah receives a phony call from the show telling her that she is going to be the next contestant. Sarah feels that she has to lose weight to fit into her favorite red dress, so that she can look good for the show. Sara visits her local doctor, who prescribes her diet pills that work miraculously. Unfortunately, the pills turn out to be amphetamines. Sarah's son Harry(Jared Leto) and his best friend Tyrone(Marlon Wayans) are heroine addicts that spend all of their time either consuming , or selling to maintain their habbit. However, when their supply is cut off, Harry and Tyrone run into a fatal losing streak that manages to take Harry's girlfriend Marion(Jennifer Connely) down with them. Now all four characters must try and regain control of their lives. <br />&quot;Requiem For a Dream&quot; offers the most realistic look at addiction that I have ever seen. The story is emotional and hard hitting, going back and forth between Sarah and Harry and company. The film is shot brilliantly. The actual ingestion of the drug is extremely graphic and disturbing. After the drug is done, we see a short period when their life seems better. But afterwards, we get to see reality come crashing down on all of them with how quick the effect ends. According to Entertainment Weekly, this film is so realistic that it should be seen in high schools across America. Too bad the NC-17 rating wouldn't sit well with parents. The musical score is haunting, and extremely beautiful. It really helps to drive the movie on the downward spiral that it travels on. <br />All the performances are outstanding. Jared Leto is amazing as Harry. The character offers all the false promises of an addict and a shocking portrayal of using and hitting rock bottom. Ellen Burstyn does the best job in the film. Her portrayal of Sarah is one that we really feel sorry for. The path she travels down, was forced onto her by a dishonest doctor. The emotion that she puts forth is very realistic! Jennifer Connely, Christopher McDonald, and Marlon Wayans are also outstanding. <br />&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is a movie for the ages. It is one that will never fail to amaze audiences everywhere. The amazing story, reality of the drug scene, and performances are all flawless. The DVD is outstanding. It is extremely low priced, and the extras include commentary from the director, a making of documentary, deleted scenes, and much much more!
B000000W5B|4.0|I'll say what's been said before: GOAT'S HEAD SOUP does not compare to EXILE ON MAIN STREET, STICKY FINGERS, or BEGGARS BANQUET.  Taking that into consideration, it's still a pretty fine album.<br />GOAT'S HEAD SOUP has its share of winners.  &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; rocks with the Stones' best (the clavinet underscores the song's unmistakably '70s sound).  &quot;Coming Down Again&quot; is a beautiful piano-based ballad, while &quot;Angie&quot; (the album's best known song) has suffered from over-familiarity over the years, but it's still a great ballad.<br />The Stones seem a bit lazy on songs like &quot;Silver Train&quot;, virtually recycling riffs that sounded better the first time around on EXILE ON MAIN STREET.  The rest of the material is nice, but not up to par with previous releases.  All in all, it's a worthwhile purchase, but only after acquainting yourself with the classics.  And don't forget to stick around for &quot;Star Star&quot;.

Kiyosaki understands money and teaches people how to millionaires by Rich Dad Poor Dad. His thought on money is simulated from his two different dads - one is his poor dad and another one is his rich dad.<BR>    <BR>    Generally, people earn money and spend more. The demand of money is infinity and people can't excape from the financial struggle.  This is like a &quot;Rat Race&quot;. Even a person with substantial high incomes, he/ she won't get out of this &quot;Rat Race&quot;. Indeed, his poor dad is not really &quot;poor&quot;. He has high education and is sucessful in his career. However, he is described as poor becasue  Robert noticed that he can't get of out this &quot;Rat Race&quot;. <BR>    <BR>    On the other hand, Robert has a rich dad. He is Rich, because he knows money. This rich won't work for money. In contrast, money works for them. How's it done? It can be simply explained with one word - Investment.<BR>    <BR>    People are working hard for moeny because of the traditional thinking on money. People always think that lifes are ensured by getting into a big company with high salary and thus people study hard in order to get a high position. Personally, this is a save but not wise way to play during a life as we can't excape from the &quot;Rat Race&quot; ! In order to play it in a wise way, we have to understand money so that we can know the ways to let money work for us. Robert teaches people how to do the cash flow analysis and suggests different investment in this book. Maybe it is somehow not practical as we need to start with certain money or abililties. However, this book let people review their cash flow and let people be aware of the situation they are living now - in a &quot;Rat Rice&quot;. It simulates people thinking on money.
B0000AMRJC|3.0|It is not a subtle story Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone are telling in &quot;Scarface,&quot; nor is it a subtle metaphor; the saga of exiled Cuban criminal Tony Montana (Al Pacino) zooming to the top of the American capitalist structure with his drug empire, then plunging, seemingly belly flop first, into death is a beat-you-with-a-hammer version of &quot;The Godfather.&quot; <br />The ruthlessness of the film makes it particularly popular in our more ruthless times - the hip-hop nation, led by mogul P. Diddy's claim that he wishes he could watch it 24 hours a day, seems especially plugged in to whatever moral Stone and DePalma are trying to pitch, so much so, a documentary on its effect is included in the DVD package. To be fair to Stone, his scripts remained defiant and ambitious. He just directed them better.<br />Looking at it again, 20 years later, the movie has painfully dated in some ways, not in others. Pacino's performance is still foolishly over-the-top - sadly, his portrayal of the cartoonish, slurring Montana seemed to inform just about every job he's done since by getting THIS LOUD every time a minutely important moment occurs on screen, the restrained examples being &quot;Sea of Love&quot; and &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; - while the rise/fall plotline follows too direct, simplistic a line. The shades played out in the &quot;Godfather&quot; trilogy, &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; and the Pacino/DePalma reteam in &quot;Carlito's Way&quot; are not there in Montana. He's straight crazy, a surviving virus finally met with himself by movie's end, only with more guns. <br />More memorable now is the performance by Mary Stuart Mastrantonio, as Tony's sister, a sweet girl pulled further into Tony's world until she is of it and able to play just a dangerous game as Tony after her lover (and Tony's partner) Manolo (Steven Bauer) is killed by Tony, ostensibly because Tony would in secret prefer his sister for himself.<BR> <BR>The enduring legacy of &quot;Scarface,&quot; as shown clearly in the hip-hop documentary, is that it's big, bold, violent, filled with ugly mantras (&quot;the power, the money, the women&quot;) material items, gorgeous women and hidden passions, such as incest, that only within the reach of a true showstopper psycho like Tony. Though Montana dies, Pacino packs so much bravado in his death that even that moment is glorified as a fitting end - that to have it all, lose it all, die and do it with a strut is the key to a short, happy life. The more recent &quot;Blow&quot; isn't nearly as exciting, but its lines aren't blurred; &quot;Scarface,&quot; intentionally, I think, cheerfully endorsed Tony in 1983, and still does. It's entertainment, extremely well-filmed entertainment, but ugly, and at its core, rotten. It's admirable and loathsome in equal portions.
0385504209|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that I thought Angels and Demons was better.  I figured out a lot of the plot before I was supposed to, but all in all, this book was exciting, intelligent, and has made me think about all the things we take on faith.  I finished it 4 days ago and I am still thinking about the story every day.  I am a Christian, but I realize that even if we know the Bible, it is not the complete story. It can't be.<br />In fact, I like the idea of Jeasus holding the female sacred a lot better than the current idea of women as second class citizens.  Kudos to Dan Brown on his excellent research and wonderful story.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|ahh, a must have kids. i played my mer de noms cd almost to its breaking point in eager anticipation of this albumn. the wait was weel worth it. it totally blows the first albumn (although mer de noms is very dear to my heart) out of the water. its apc in some of its best form. and like others have said,this is not tool. dont get me wrong, i love tool, but just because they have the same vocalist doesnt mean they have to saound exactly the same in style. this is another work of art by another group of artists. maynard is only a part of this masterpeice, an di wish people would stop comparing ht two. anyway if you have this cd, enjoy (i know i have), and if you dont, go get it, you will not be disapointed.
B000089RVR|3.0|No Angel was one of the best debut albums that I've bought in recent years. Being a fan of Sarah McLachlan, Sinead O'Conner, the personal folksy modern pop angle of Dido was just right up my alley. Now, the followup album seems to extend upon the tried and true formula of the first, but ends up disappointing. The general style is similar, but ultimately disappoints in its predictability, and lack of catchy emotional melodies that defined the first album. The actual lyrics are darker, but most of the songs sound more homogeneous, taking no chances to differentiate themselves. I had this album on repeat in my car, but after listening to it for multiple times, it didn't have the holding power or any standout tracks that had me humming the tune.

0156027321|4.0|What a wonderful and thought provoking book Mr. Martel has produced.  I cannot think of another book to which it can be compared, a fact that makes it a very unique piece of literature.<br />Through the precociousness of the title character, Pi Patel the reader is introduced to some vivid opinions on human and animal behaviior.  As I read the book I found myself re-evaluating some long held opinions regarding zoos and the adaptability of animals.<br />Mr. Martels descriptions of life aboard a raft reminded me of how open spaces can often be the most claustrophobic.<br />More than anything the novel exists as a testimony to the purety of the human heart and how a suspension of disbelief can be liberating.  Events do not necessarily have to be substantive to have real meaning for our lives.  At times it may be necessary to go &quot;mad&quot; to remain &quot;sane.&quot;<br />Aside from some vivid descriptions of violence, this book is suitable for a variety of ages, from teenagers on up.  I recommend it to any reader who wants to stay in touch with their love of creativity, a part of our soul that is often extinguished.
B000002UAR|5.0|I have written 231 reviews for Amazon so far, but have abstained from writing about my all-time favorite up until now, for it seemed like too gargantuan a task.  Not only is this one of the most discussed albums ever made, it is just so frighteningly perfect on every level that one could write an entire book pontificating on its lyrical, musical, conceptual and production merits, as well as its enduring influence nearly 40 years later. Indeed, whole books have been written with \\"Revolver\\" as their primary focal point; even after an estimated 5,000 listens to date (a decade ago, between the ages of 14 and 17, I used to listen to this album twice a day, every day!) it still seems amazingly fresh, which is another part of its almost scary legend.  Its magical pull and personal relevance shall never grow old, and as members of the band pass away one by one, it is gradually being hailed as one of the finest works of art of the past century, in any musical genre, being both brilliant and far ahead of its time, while still very much a crowning part of that glorious period in London which peaked around '66/'67.<br />Although often labeled the electric-based \\"sister\\" album to the primarily mellow, acoustic \\"Rubber Soul\\", the sounds, themes and styles of \\"Revolver\\" make it more of a companion to the album it foreshadowed, \\"Sgt.Pepper\\".  And yet, although the album does not have the loose concept that brought \\"Pepper\\" together (and gave it much of its fame), its songs are all thematically tied and there is a better balance between Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison compositions, with absolutely *no* filler (or even \\"ever-so-slightly-substandard\\")  moments anywhere (word has it anyway that the band wanted it to be the first album to have no three-second silence between the tracks, but Parlophone would not let them until the following work).  <br />Lyrically, this is easily one of the most genuinely philosophical albums in rock, which is made all the more ingenious by the unforced,intuitive nature of the words.  Beginning with powerful examinations of our monetary-based, existentially unfulfilled and very lonely material world (\\"Taxman\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\") and continuing with problems of miscommunication (\\"For No One\\", \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", \\"I Want To Tell You\\"), the album gradually probes the Jungian subconscious (Lennon's brilliant \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and \\"She Said She Said\\"), drugs (\\"Doctor Robert\\", \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\"), unconditional love (\\"Here There And Everywhere\\", \\"Good Day Sunshine\\") and Eastern religion (\\"Love You To\\") for possible answers and finds connections between these, before eventually arriving at the futuristic, psychedelic paradise which resolves these issues (\\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\") and from which \\"Pepper\\" would seem the logical--and necessary--next step.  Thus, the album was also one of the first, seminal and best manifestos of the emerging 60s counterculture which would change our straightlaced Western society for good.<br />Musically, the album covers every genre of pop up to that point in time and helps to pioneer psychedelia and art-rock along the way; the jarring juxtaposition of pulsating hard rock (on \\"Taxman\\", \\"She Said She Said\\" and \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", all rocking far harder than  anything previously) with quasi-baroque classicism, Indian raga, Stax soul, music-hall, a children's novelty singalong and Stockhausen-inspired experimental tape loops--all fitted to the compact, catchy three-minute pop format--was simply pure genius.  Considering that \\"Revolver\\" is essentially a transitional album (moving as it does from the folk-rock sound of \\"Rubber Soul\\" to the rainbow-colored wonderland of \\"Pepper\\"), and considering that most transitional albums usually sound tentative (like The Byrds' \\"Fifth Dimension\\" and The Kinks' \\"Face To Face\\", two great but slightly uneven efforts recorded at the same time), the fact that the album sounds so perfect in every way, as if the band had been recording ones like it for years, is another amazing triumph.  The playing is easily the group's most virtuosic up to that time: Paul's bass work is a marvel and Ringo proves on \\"She Said She Said\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" that he was not simply \\"along for the ride\\".  Only Harrison's \\"I Want To Tell You\\" sounds slightly rushed; it is still a five-star classic, with a classic opening riff, but the guitar timbre sounds a little thin compared to the heavily fuzzed and amplified sound of the other rockers--we would have to wait until the '91 live version with Eric Clapton to see the song's full potential revealed, sporting a big meaty sound and several lovely added solos.  <br />The transformed, newly psychedelic guitar sound--especially the churning, distorted, hypnotic rush that propels \\"She Said She Said\\" (which sounds original to this day), McCartney's red-hot raga-inspired solo in \\"Taxman\\" and the spellbinding backwards pull of \\"I'm Only Sleeping and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\"--is but one of the production highlights which made this record so unique and ahead of itself. The invention of backwards tape loops, close-miking, vari-speed and Ringo's new drum sound was again applied perfectly, like the band had been using these tricks for twenty years.  One of my favorite aspects of this album are the subtle and frequently overlooked sonic layers which pop up on repeated listenings, such as the fuzz guitars that grace \\"Love You To\\" (which make it a true raga-rock fusion), the electric organ buried but still felt on \\"She Said She Said\\" and the incredible closing vocal harmonies in \\"Good Day Sunshine\\". When one considers the dozens of revolutionary new sounds concocted for \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and the almost random, unorthodox method of its recording, it easily could've been a disaster but instead turned out to be one of the most legendary psych numbers of all time.  The \\"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\\" remixes of \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Love You To\\" proved that a proper remixing and/or remastering to bring out these elements is long overdue; Capitol gave us \\"1\\", now please give us properly mastered editions of all of their meisterworks already, OK?!?
B000002J29|5.0|I having nothing critical to add to the reviews of the esteemed company below, all of whom have excellent taste in early Genesis. Today a mate delivered to me a CD copy of my original vinyl album, which as a spotty teenager, I had thrashed to almost 45 speed, before the likes of ECostello and the Jam took over the turntable. Naturally, it has all the ticks and small scratches faithfully copied from my old 33. Its the first time I think I have listened to this album in almost 20 years. It brought back memories of headphones on, back from the pub late at night, utterly transported to another place. The number of times I remember thinking that my biggest ever regret in life then was that I wasn't at these Paris concerts, though I would have been too young at the time. My copies now convince me that I need to obtain the remaster, and gain faithfulness to the memory of the music in all its clarity. My other half on hearing this tonight said &quot;well, I guess you had to be there&quot;. Its sounds dated now of course, but my god, what a fine band they were, and what a night it must have been! I saw them live several times in the late seventies and early eighties, but this concert captured them at the apex I think, perhaps not of their creativity, but certainly their capacity for a live gig, which would never be surpassed. If you have any interest in typically English prog-rock of this era, this is the album to buy. I think I might frame my vinyl album and hang it in some special corner, and definitely buy the CD. Onya boys.
B0000691U1|5.0|Duke Ellington, Charlie Mingus and Max Roach. Enough said. This is truly a masterpiece and should be in any collection. These three unbelievable musicians tackle classic Ellington tracks such as &quot;Solitude&quot; and &quot;Caravan&quot; and yet they are performed in such a way that they sound new and fresh.  The album has a much more &quot;raw&quot; feel than the majority of Ellington's work. This a record where these three shine together in an amazing way and should be listened to and appreciated my almost any jazz fan.
B00003GPHK|1.0|Stupid, patronizing, poorly directed exploitation of Star Trek fans.  The 'coming attractions' was the best part of this particular visit to the theater.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|When I read that Jethro Tull was going to release a Christmas album, I immediately thought &quot;uh-oh! this might be the beginning of the end folks.&quot; I mean, lets face it, this kind of project is just ripe with opportunities for the band to take that slippery slide down into the inescapable pool of mediocrity. There would be our beloved band on the &quot;seasonal budget shelf&quot; with the likes of Dolly Parton, Donny &amp; Marie, and The Partridge Family hocking their trite and uninspired covers of &quot;holiday classics.&quot;<br />But, fear not! This is Ian and the lads, and they've produced yet another masterpiece! The song selection is a mixture of appropriate tunes from their vast catalog, all masterfully rearranged and rerecorded with the mature and polished skill of a band at the top of it's game. There are arrangements of some quintessentially British holiday songs done in Bristol fashion; and a few new songs that are destined to become classics, including A WINTER'S SNOWSCAPE, my favorite song from Martin Barre's new solo album - Stage Left.<br />It's also great to hear our old friend Dave Pegg lending his talent on a few songs, notably his wonderful mandolin playing on the classic &quot;A CHRISTMAS SONG.&quot; Sometime stand-in drummer James Duncan also lends his talent to this album.<br />This is a great, great album and a welcome addition to the Tull body of work. It's appeal will guarantee repeated playing for years to come during the holiday seasons, but it'll get it's fair share of playing time in the dog days of summer as well.<br />Enjoy
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This album has a great variety of styles to it, some, in fact, that remind me of Radiohead. The overall theme is quiet and eclectic. Good music. Often relaxing.
B00003CWN3|5.0|Boys Don't Cry is the kind of movie you go to the movies to see.  Director Kimberly Peirce (in unbelievably- her first feature length film) does, what I believe, the point of cinema is to do: she connects us fully and powerfully to the characters onscreen, and via that connection, communicates something unique about society.  In this case, the characters are disillusioned, Nebraska youth and the message is gender, the mystery and illusion of sex, the roots of bigotry, the perils and raptures of youthful idealism, etc. Each viewer can interpret what the film is symbolically \\"about\\" and have a wealth of evidence to back their interpretations up  -its dexterity is that universal, and certainly transcends the label \\"gay film.\\"    <br />At the center of the film is Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank) a real-life girl who thought of herself as a boy and proceeded to be very sexually successful with many young women- until his untimely rape and murder at the hands of his friends.  According to the excellent DVD commentary, Peirce wanted to create a classic male American anti-hero like Montgomery Clift and Jake la Motta to enable the transvestite Brandon Teena an accessible character.  So in the grand traditions of those heroes, Brandon is a charismatic, self-proclaimed \\"a-hole\\"- full-bodied and believable because of his moral in addition to sexual ambiguities.  <br />The film charts Brandon's rise and fall with a group of people in Falls City that society undoubtedly pegs \\"trailer trash.\\"  Brandon meets the violent but friendly John (Peter Sarsgaard) who hangs out with the masochistic Tom (Brendan Sexton III).  Brandon's vulnerability, as a woman, and as a kid trying to fit in, drives the story's menace as his new friends reveal themselves as violent, baneful influences.  Though they easily could have been easy portraits of machismo gone wrong, Peirce clearly extends her empathy to John and Tom, portraying them as products of abusive, ignorant environments.  <br />This is also true of Lana, (Chloe Sevigny) a red-haired, sleepy-eyed young woman who falls for Brandon's winsome, contextually exotic charms.  Lana embodies a number of qualities: grace under fire, the effects of parental alcoholism, soul-depleting minimum wage jobs, and, as critic David Edelstein noted, the allusive quality of sex, when she becomes a willing participant in deception.  She is duped not by low self-esteem but by that intangible illusion necessary in loving someone.  Rapturously displayed in a series of lyrically filmed erotic scenes, Brandon and Lana's sex life fully illuminates the film's psychosexual themes, with Lana at its symbolic heart.  It says something magnificent about Peirce and Sevigny that they can make Lana mean so much without compromising (and in fact benefiting from) her individuality.  At the end of the film, she's a believable human being, not a poster child.  <br />The commentary track by Kimberly Peirce is enlightening and informative and funny, engaging the viewer/listener in an active conversation.  One thing I found particularly interesting were her insightful ruminations upon the pop music used in her movie.  The Cars \\"Just What I Needed;\\" The Cure's \\"Boys Don't Cry;\\" Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Tuesdays Gone;\\"  and Little Texas's \\"Bluest Eyes in Texas\\" each have a profound effect on the tone and meaning of their respective scenes.  Peirce explains the pain-staking measures she took to ensure that the music was properly integrated into the movie's mileu.      <br />By the end of Boys Don't Cry, I was in tears, both sad and happy.  I was sad that Brandon Teena had died so brutally.  And I was happy that Kimberly Peirce had just created such a beautiful movie.  Its psychosocial critical eye is matched only by its compassionate exaltation of humanity.
B00005CDNK|5.0|This is by far my favorite Abba album.  Even though the end was near the music still spoke - and what volumes it had to say!  Track by track this album should be on any list of Greatest of All Time.  On this issue are bonus tracks - all available on the Thank You For The Music box set.  The only pity here is the fact that they chose to add these instead of some unreleased material (like the great lost track 'Just Like That' in unedited form or maybe the demo of 'Two For The Price Of One' which told the same story as the final song only in first person).  Here's hoping that the vaults will open a bit more someday...
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|i know apc renovated their band between albums--but they still kept the solid groundwork of maynard,billy,and josh....i was sad to see paz go but then again listen to Thirteenth Step....the playin on this album is unbelievable...the package is a perfect opening track and is followed by good song after good song..especially the outsider and pet...my only critique is how they ended the album, they closed it with gravity...dont get me wrong it is a very cool song but i personally think they should have ended it with pet and the lullaby outro...but overall i give it 5 stars..apc is back and better than ever and i cant wait to see them at voodoo fest in new orleans
B000062XKL|4.0|this is a good heist movie and i'm really glad I saw this amd bought it. Norton wants DeNiro to help him with a heist that involves a gold septer thing that's locked away in a place he's working at as a retarded man named Brian. all along the way we have a great cast including a crazy hacker kid who still lives with his mom and you have Marlon Brando as Max, who is really great and in a better performance then his last stink pot the island of dr moreau. angela bassett is also good as DeNiro's girl. The twist at the end is great. Norton later does another heist movie in the remake of the italian job with seth green. lots of fun and there are some veteran jazz musicians in cameos as well
0060930187|4.0|This book was very unique. Im not really excited about reading, but when i picked up this book i just coundn't put it down. My favorite part of this book is the short possitive messages they send. It was a real life story that inspire people to become better people. I ranked this a 4 because of the great unique writting and drama's. -nh
B000077VT7|4.0|I thought this movie was gonna be a bore but this one is really a keeper. it puts a lot of action and suspense into one ball and lets it explode. damon is excellent as jason bourne and franka potente is beautiful as always. clive owen is great in a supporting part as the professor(he's the one who gets shotgunned by damon in the field). all in all it pays off and its wonderfully made and the stunts are great. damon is really doing all his stunts
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card has created a beautiful masterpiece, the book itself is greatly detailed and the plot is a thrilling eye-opener. I loved how there even was a side story of his brother and sister that tied in with the tale of Ender Wiggins. You even feel edgy when he is on the brink of insanity or, just giving up.  <BR>I have recently finished the book and cannot wait to read the next.
B00006RCPM|5.0|next to roles like Jerry Maguire and Ethan Hunt is Mission Immossible, theres Tom Cruise in Minority Report and this is really a great role for him and Steven Spielberg's direction and the characters and atmosphere pay off in this. obviously one of Spielberg's harshest. in the future crimes can be sceen before they ever happen and thats what Cruise and the rest of his team do, is put away the badguys, but something will happen to Cruise and he will have to run to save his own ass from being put away. Colin Farrell is along for the ride as the cop whos trying to catch Cruise but finds out something else as well. riveting, extrodinary and shocking. this one hits the bullseye
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I was more than pleasantly surprised with the overall quality of this DVD. I'm not going to say much about the movie: if you haven't seen one of the best movies (and arguably the best in the genre) ever made, you've missed a classic, so go see it. <br />The DVD offers superb image quality. The colors and sharpness are excellent, the image pristine, like it was shot yesterday instead of some 35 years ago. These days too many DVD's contain a simple copy of whatever master the producers happened to have lying around, with faded colors, grain, noise, scratches and everything. This DVD is an example of how it should be done: apparently starting with a good vault copy, the producers have removed dust, scratches and noise, and not just with an automatic filter that blurs all details. The colors have apparently been restored, being very close to what they originally were. Just don't expect too much of the 5.1 surround sound, but there are limites to what remixing can do.<br />The extra's are well worth watching, too, for a change. Normally I'm very much underwhelmed by the shovelware most producers fill up their empty disk space with. The first DVD contains the movie with additional commentaries, the second DVD contains documentaries about the film and the history against which the story is set, and these actually add something worthwhile to the experience of watching and re-watching the movie. A refreshing change after too many DVD's with so-called extra's that consist of a \\"making of\\" that's little less than a promo, and a theater trailer. And the extra's are in widescreen format too, something that is also sadly lacking from most other DVDs. Generally the feature movie is in widescreen format, but the extra are invariably either in 4x3 format or, if you're lucky, letterboxed. Heaven knows why... but on this DVD the producers haven't made the same mistake.<br />It's quite good to see a properly mastered and produced DVD for a change. This is the way it should be done!<br/>(Oh, and if you haven't seen the movie... really, you've missed something important. Enough said.)
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Warner Bros. took forever to produce this DVD from their classic library, and by gum, it was worth the wait.  My copy arrived only last night and I've already watched the film, and about 1/3 of the voluminous bonus materials.  The print is the best you've ever seen of this glorious Technicolor effort.  As others have noted, there is some grain, especially in the early castle interior scenes, but once we're taken to the forest, the colors burst from the screen.  <BR>     There's so much here to rave about, but I'll highlight a few of my favorites.  Disc two is loaded, boasting a retrospective with commentators like Maltin, Behlmer, and Osborne. It is a terrific companion piece to the film and well worth the 35-minutes investment.  During that feature, make sure to pause the DVD to read the actual letter from Erich Wolfgang Korngold asking to be let off the project as musical composer.  Unfortunate affairs in his native Austria changed his mind, leading to one of the great scores in American cinema.  Nice touch that you can isolate that Oscar-winning score on the feature disc.  Don't miss the outtakes either... and the home movies shot by Rathbone and others during filming. <BR>     My only regret is that the never-so-beautiful-as-she-is-here Olivia de Haviland was not interviewed.  At age 87, she seems as elegant and eloquent as ever, based on her appearance at this year's Academy Award telecast.  I'm sure her memories of Flynn in general and Robin Hood in particular would have made this an even more revealing look back at this magnificent film.
0913866156|5.0|There are at least two types of printings of the large format of this deck. In one type the deck looks great (basically excactly like the smaller version), in the other the color quality is terrible, the fronts of all the cards having a sage-green tint.      You can tell them apart in several ways:   1) Certain editions (see ISBN: 0880794690) are known good  but they're also hard to find.  2) Look at the ends of the box, if you see the words \\"Printed in Belgium\\" anywhere on the box, you've probably got a bad one, but I've found good decks in the wrong boxes sometimes, so to be certain...  3) Take the cards of the box, leavinging them still sealed in their internal plastic wrapping and look at the border of the bottom card (or request that your seller do so). Only if the border of the card is a silver/gray (NOT at all green-ish) should you buy it.  I personally am offended that the publisher hasn't recalled the ones with poor printing.    While I agree with other reviewers that the suit cards have far simpler images on them than you'll find in many decks, they're still far from flat or offering \\"few clues as to the meaning of the cards\\".  They're quite evocative, and if you're lost, the one-word meaning on the card will point you atleast in the right direction.    Many of the comments I've read about the \\"dark\\" and \\"harder to read\\" qualities of this deck sound to me like they're describing the cards with poor color.  Find a well-printed deck, and, whether you know all their symbology or not, these cards will speak to you.
B0000AMJED|5.0|This is better then the original.  First off Miami is a much better location for this kinda movie than LA was in the first.<BR>People said the movie would suck cause there was no diesel, they're wrong, Tyrese is better than diesel, and unlike vin diesels character, Tyrese's actually has a sense of humor.  Cars are better too.  The Nissan Skyline itself was sweeter than any car in the first.  The ending was also better, jumping a charger onto a yacht.  This movie doesnt make you think, its a great popcorn flick.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallvile is one of my favorite shows in an age of graphic violence and explicit sex.  It has changed an old story, that of a young boy searching for who he is, and put a modern twist on it:  he is destined to be Superman.  This 1st season DVD set came out right in time for me to view it before the 3rd season premiere.  I realize that it isn't a great show, but I also realize that most of the other shows still airing are absolute crap.  More shows should try and emulate this style.
0812968255|5.0|This book is really two pamphlets in one. Each is well worth reading in its own right. Together, they are a real treat.<br />In the introduction, the author provides a high level but highly instructive overview of the life and times of Marcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome from A.D. 161 until his death in 180. From the brief biography of Marcus through the discussion of the philosophical traditions that informed the Emperor and, ultimately, the Meditations, to the summary of recurring themes, the Introduction is very worthwhile reading. The author conveniently includes some suggestions for further reading to allow any who are interested to plunge well below the surface that is only lightly touched here.<br />The heart of the book, the Meditations themselves, is a superb and enduring testament to the community of humankind. Written nearly 2000 years ago, the Meditations, which Marcus never expected to be read by anyone other than himself and, perhaps, his son, reveal how consistently and deeply themes like death, integrity, ethics, and tolerance affect all people at all times. Perhaps the most notable reaction to reading this very accessible translation is that here, speaking across 20 centuries, is the basis for a successful career as a 21st Century &quot;self-help guru&quot;.
B000002UB3|4.0|The Beatles' final album is also arguably their best. Songs like Something and I Want You are masterpieces, and the side 2 medley is brilliant. I strongly reccomend this album for an up-and-coming Beatle fan or a general rock fan. Only Sgt pepper and the white album can top this.
B00005JLTN|1.0|Although I enjoyed the first Matrix, I did think it was slightly silly and pretentious, especially all that ridiculous shiny black leather thing. But I could suspend my disbelief for a couple of hours and just enjoy it. But not this abomination.  Firstly the plot was idiotic, the dialogue, as another reviewer so correctly put it, was just a bunch of \\"meaningless, pretentious, pseudo-philosophic mumbo-jumbo\\" masquerading as some form of post-modern mysticism. I got seriously tired of listening to Fishburne, whom I have never rated and was always at his best playing a NY mugger in Death Wish, spouting some crap about \\"prophecy\\" and his \\"beliefs\\". Then there was Zion, ZION for God's sake, which appeared to be some sort of high-tech industrial nightmare, that strangely contained people dressed in rags like paupers (what, all this high technology and they can't make clothes?). The bizarre rave/orgy scene was insufferable and seemed like it would never end. And what is with the black/white ratio in this film. 75% of the people in the film are black. When they meet the Council of Zion, there is only 1 white person on the entire council, everone else is black. What is with that? The fight scenes seemed boring and contrived to me and lacked the energy they had in the first. They seemed more like choreographed dance moves than fighting, which I'm sure they were. The music was a disappointment and failed to provide the correct ambience that was present in the first film. Agent Smith was good as always, but 100 of him, that just got tiresome. The speech by the architect was techno-babble crap, and why has Neo now become Superman. They literally have him flying around with his arm extended like Clarke Kent himself. All he needed was his underpants outside his cool leather garb and the image would have been complete. He literally saves Trinity like Superman swooping in and grabbing Lois Lane who has just fallen of a skyscraper. Pathetic. The only people who could possibly like this garbage are children. The worst thing about this film is that it actually takes itself seriously. If it had been a spoof, or tongue-in-cheek I could have laughed at it. But no, these idiots are for real. And finally I have saved my most venomous comments for the character I hate the most. That Carrie-Ann whatever the hell her name is who plays Trinity. What planet is that fool living on? She is the one who takes herself the most seriously of all. Does she have any idea how ridiculous she looks in that shiny leather outfit. She looks like she's literally come straight from the set of some sado-masochism porno film. All she needs is a pink ball-gag in her mouth and some nipple-clamps. I saw her being interviewed once and she was droning on about how she loved playing Trinity because she was so tough and strong. It was obvious that she actually thought she WAS Trinity, in real life. Er, it's only pretend Carrie, not real. I could understand a 15yo girl falling for that delusion, but not a woman in her mid-30's. Basically a stupid film with flash computer graphics for kids, which after all is what the Wachowski Brothers are - big kids who never grew up. Personally I think the Wachowski brothers went from impressing the World with their first movie The Matrix, to committing movie suicide with this garbage.
0743201140|4.0|Now, Discover your Strengths (NDYS) is the follow-up of First, Break all the Rules and generates answers to many of those burning questions left from FBATR. The book starts out with three chapters discussing what a strength based organization is, and provides an overview of some concepts taken from FBATR. If you recently read FBATR, you could easily skip to the assessment test, and work thru the rest of the book with your test results.<br />The 4th chapter is an overview of all 34 strength possibilities. While it is good to know each of the strengths to understand your employees/co-workers, you could easily just breeze thru the chapter and save your disection of each of the strengths till chapter six, where they discuss how to manage an employee of each strenght.<br />The final chapter gives an implementation plan to make your organization a strengths based organization. Overall the book is laid out very similiarly to FBATR, and at times overlaps stories and concepts, but does provide additional insight into the workings of people.<br />Lastly, if you are like me, and wanted to take the assessment test before you read the book, see the reverse side of your book jacket.

B0000AMRJC|5.0|&quot;Scarface&quot; has finally been given the proper DVD treatment with this special 20th anniversary edition of the movie. While originally dismissed by film critics as an ultra-glossy celebration of violence, profanity, and drug use, this movie has now earned its rank as a modern-day classic. Al Pacino's ultra-charismatic performance of Cuban refugee turned drug kingpin, Tony Montana is certainly the highlight of this massive crime epic.<br />Tony and his partner, Manolo have exiled from Cuba and are looking to capitalize on the &quot;American dream&quot;. Starting off as foot soldiers for boss Frank Lopez, they soon move their way up the ladder in the world of drug-dealing. With bloodbaths and double-crosses at every turn of the corner, Tony eventually finds himself on top of the drug kingdom with Lopez's beautiful girlfriend (Michelle Pfeifer) as his wife and a fortune in drug money at his disposal.<br />&quot;Scarface&quot; is not a beautiful love story. It is in its essence, a tale of capitalism gone awry. While Pacino's Montana is often viewed as a loyal guy, it is his greed that manages to destroy not only himself but everyone around him. He fiends for his boss' girlfriend out of lust, not love. His relationship with this character is never treated as a romance. She is a prize that comes with the territory. The only person Tony does seem to have unconditional love for is his sister but even that love is of a such a controlling nature that he never allows for her to find true happiness. By the end of the second act, Tony is so caught up in his world of greed and drug-enduced paranoia that he seems all but finished. The murder of his best friend seems to foreshadow his own downfall.<br />This movie has become a staple of pop culture. Montana's trademark lines have been quoted in every movie from FRIDAY to ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE CALLS. While it was originally best known for its violence in such scenes as the infamous chainsaw sequence and the bullet-riddled conclusion, &quot;Scarface&quot; has grown to be a larger-than-life film.<br /><br />While this movie is revered by many as a true classic, the film itself is flawed but it is in those subtle imperfections that we have come to know and love this film. Pacino's trademark accent is ridicilous but appealing nonetheless. In fact, most of the Cuban characters are played by Italian-American actors. Steven Bauer, one of the select few authentic Cuban actors in the film is entertaining in his portrayal of Manolo, Tony's sidekick.<br />This &quot;special edition&quot; DVD presentation is amazing. We get an in-depth look at the making of the film, deleted scenes, and an explanation of the influence of the film on today's audience. This DVD is definetly an essential addition to any true film buff's collection.ed conclusion, &quot;Scarface&quot; has grown to be a larger-than-life film. <BR> <BR>While this movie is revered by many as a true classic, the film itself is flawed but it is in those subtle imperfections that we have come to know and love this film.

0316666343|5.0|I hesitated to read this book because I knew it was going to be sad.  But then, I started reading it and in spite of the chills I felt throughout, I just couldn't put it down.  It's about a young girl named Susie, who was murdered in 1973 and is looking down from heaven and watching the impact on her family. It's written in the first person which made me identify with her immediately.  And, as the story continues, I had no problem in stepping out of my &quot;real&quot; world and entering Susie's as the story unfolds through her eyes.<br />Along the way, we meet them all:  her grief-stricken father who attempts to find the killer; her mother who can't handle the burden and runs away; her sister who tries to be strong, her 4-year old brother who is confused by it all; her flaky grandmother who holds the family together; the boy she kissed once and will forever yearn for and - last but not least -- her killer.  All these characters and the way they interact are described in simple prose.  And it always is in the voice of a 14-year old.<br />The clarity of the writing made me feel I was right up there in heaven with Susie, wanting to reach out and touch the people who were affected by this terrible tragedy.  She wants to live so badly and wants to reach out to her family.  But this course seems impossible. The writing is so clear and truthful though that I had no problem when it moved into that gray area of what is or what is not possible.  By then I was so captured by the narrative that I had just fallen into the story.<br />This book has received accolades from reviewers.  I totally agree.  There's magic in the writing and I give it one of my highest recommendations.  However, even though it is beautiful, it never stops being sad.
0060090383|4.0|Rachel's friends are worried about her \\"use of recreational drugs,\\" and just to make them happy, Rachel checks into what she things is going to be sort of a spa holiday with a few optional chats on her little problem. To her horror, she finds herself in an honest-to-God drug rehab program - and she's pretty much stuck there. Hard to imagine a story based on this premise being funny, but since the Irish M. Keyes is the author, well, yup, it's funny. Rachel confronts her addiction, learns a bit about herself and some destructive relationships, and we have a longish but fun read.
B00009ATIX|5.0|This is an extraordinarily moving, thought-provoking film for those willing to let go of attachment to past versions, science fiction &quot;thrills&quot;, and verbalized philosophical discourse.  It is a triumph through its depiction of character, use of &quot;quiet,&quot; and cinematic beauty.  The questions of &quot;what is life, consciousness, love, and possible redemption&quot; are all dealt with  through visuals and superb acting--rather than Hollywood standard fare.  Both aching and triumphant--it may be one of the 10 movies you remember most in your lifetime.
0694003611|5.0|To those of us who raised our children on this book, nudging them toward sleep each night with one more, please Mommy, just one more book and please Mommy, please make it Goodnight Moon, the opening lines will always be familiar: In the great green room there was a red balloon - - - and finally there was a spoon and a brush and a bowl full of mush, and a quiet old lady whispering `Hush.'<BR>As you slowly turn the pages, drinking in the images, you begin to notice things. The room gets darker with each page, the hands of the clock progress. The mouse is always there, but it is sometimes hard to find him. The kittens get drowsy, and so does the bunny. There's less mush in the bowl. And most of all the moon rises; in each picture it's a little higher above the windowsill.<BR>Simply brilliant.<BR>Always enough to make a tired parent drowsy, for sure, and usually it works for the child, too! This classic book should be given to every first-time pregnant mom at her baby shower.
0446608955|1.0|I have heard people praise this book for quite some time now. In order to get them to quit bugging me to read it, I checked it out from my library and read it in three days. Now, I can't say I was happy. This book seems like it was written in one night- especially because the book's quality is so bad. Anyway, I found this book to also be:<br />- Predictable: Just like a fairy tale, I could almost always guess what would happen next. C'mon, people like to read books with twists, turns, and surprises! (Which this book didn't have much of!)<br />- Rushed: Towards the end, ... all the events in the book were quickly rushed to that conclusion. That was seriously annoying, considering the fact that that conclusion was also just written to make the book seem a bit more interesting.<br />-Religous: On nearly EVERY page, this book has something to do with religon. It drove me nuts! (BEWARE!)<br />-Strange: Why Landon would fall for a perfect, sweet girl like Jamie, I don't know, but part of the problem here is that they have absoulutely no chemistry between them. I mean, half of the time they just sit and talk about the weather! Is that what real boyfriends and girlfriends do? (Though I'm not sure you can consider Landon and Jamie boyfriend and girlfriend)<br />- Flawless: ALL of the characters were (may I say this?) PERFECT. That's right, they had no flaws, and that just made them seem shallow and transparent. Why not have some characters that aren't so perfect once in a while?<br />I can go on and on about how bad this book was, but I'll stop here. If you're looking for a romance about two teenage high schoolers, forget this book. The plot is weak, characters are too perfect... yadda, yadda, yadda. Save your money, just don't read this book!
B00000ING2|5.0|If Fargo could bag an Oscar, The Hudsucker Proxy should be Required Viewing. To put it simply, this is sheer genius on tape, there really is so little not to like about this film.<br />The Coens attempted to revive the screwball comedy genre, and boy did they do it. Tim Robbins enjoys himself immensely as the gormless mailroom boy promoted to company President in the space of one day as a patsy to allow boardroom creeps to gain control of the Hudsucker company. Jennifer Leigh's amalgam of Katharine Hepburn/Rosalind Russell/Jean Arthur (from the 1930s) is priceless. I personally felt Paul Newman was a bit wasted in his role, but that's just me.<br />However, these performances would be for nothing if it wasn't for the marvellous script- witness the boardroom scenes in which the directors discuss how many floors it was that Mr Hudsucker fell (&quot;not including the mezzanine&quot;) or the scene in which they interrogate Norville about his new invention. The script is also responsible for the fantastic line &quot;Y'know, for kids!&quot; which means nothing if you haven't seen the movie but now always makes me laugh whenever I think of it.<br />Film making at its finest. Rent it, steal it, embezzle it -- but watch this gem!
B00000I8BX|3.0|Fear Factory's third official release, this album is... Very hard to judge. It seems like they wanted a simular style they had on the spectacular Demanufacture album, but also wanted it to be more radio-friendly. And that's what they got to be hoenst. It starts off good with tracks like Shock, and Edgecrusher (which is clearly aimed at the angry-teen typed listener). But to be honest, much of this album is boring. Securitron, Descent, and Resurrection are really the only other songs on the jewel-cased album worth mentioning. 5/10 tracks is all right, but it's not that great of odds. Again, like the band norm, the digipak features extra tracks. It has two covers on it, one being of Gary Numan's &quot;Cars&quot; which is basically what made this album sell so well, and the other of &quot;0-0 [Where Evil Dwells]&quot; by an 80's industrial group known as Wiseblood. Both these are better than the originals, and Cars even has Gary Numan doing guest vocals. There's also a track from a video game, which is interesting, but very repetive, and re-recordings of two songs from their early days, but alas aren't very good. The digipak is a better value, simply for the two covers. But this is probably their worst album.

B000000H5J|5.0|Fear Factory's second full release, and to this day, despite everything else they've done, this still holds up as being the greatest album the band has ever done, in fact, this could be considered one of the greatest heavy albums of all time. Fear Factory did a radical change of style with this album, from death metal on their first album, to industrial metal on this one, and it was the best thing they could have done. Right away from track one, the title track, this album amazes. The first track, the second, the third, the fourth (Replica, which actually had a video filmed for it), the fifth (New Breed, which became a big dance hit), the sixth (Dog Day Sunrise, originally a Head of David song), the ninth, the tenth (Pisschrist, which samples music from Terminator 2), and the 11th (A Therapy For Pain, which is a very slow and melodic song doen superbly). The digipak version features b-sides, which eventually became the norm for Fear Factory to release b-sides in digipak versions of their albums. The digipak features a punk cover, a rather hardcore track, and two remixes, which are neither better nor, nor worse than the original versions. The only real songs on the album that don't deliver well are Body Hammer, &amp; Flashpoint. But they're not bad songs, they just don't compare to everything else on the album. I can't really mention track highlights, because nearly everything on this disc is perfect.
B00006ZCFH|2.0|When &quot;Mama's Gun&quot; first came out I was so excited because I loved the album's lead single &quot;Bag Lady&quot; that I had been hearing on the radio. When I got the album I was sorely disappointed--the version on &quot;Mama's Gun&quot; was completely different than the version on the radio. I grew to like the album version, but it didn't compare to the hit version. Fast forward a few years, and I was so looking forward to having her smash from earlier this year &quot;Love Of My Life&quot; on this album, and when I saw that it was one of the tracks I was thrilled. However, upon hearing the album I realize that the version included here is a completely different sounding song. C'mon Erykah, sure you may be trippy, alternative, and everything else, but how about being nice to your fans for once? It ain't all about you, y'know. <BR>I guess I'll have to wait for an Erykah Badu greatest hits to own the correct versions (or hit versions) of her singles. Boo.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Everybody ends up at Rick's. In this case, that's a good thing as Casablanca has been remastered and stocked with an additional disc of extras for this 60th anniversary edition. As far as DVDs go, this ain't just another gin joint. This deluxe edition of Casablanca mirrors The Right Stuff and the recently released The Adventures of Robin Hood as an example of how to do right by a classic film. Directed by Michael Curtiz from a marvelous screenplay written by Julius &amp; Philip Epstein and Howard Koch, Casablanca has transcended the era it was made in. The definition of a classic is exactly that; a film that transcends time and manages to exert its influence beyond the year it was made and viewed.<br />This is the second incarnation of Casablanca. Originally released just a couple years ago as a single disc DVD, the film has been reborn as a deluxe two disc dual layer baby with the stunning complexion of a model and the sharpness of a MENSA member. There aren't a lot of films worthy of such a recent reissue and expansion but this classic film deserves it in spades.<br />Set during World War Two Humphrey Bogart plays Rick the owner of a nightclub imaginatively named Rick's Cafe Americain. Rick runs his &quot;gin joint&quot; in French occupied Morocco but German controlled . Waltzing into his club one night is a former lover Ilsa played by a stunning Ingrid Bergman. She and her husband husband Victor (the under rated Paul Henreid) are on the run from the Nazis.  Everyone wants a piece of them and their only salvation in this duplicitious  town is Rick.<br />With an outstanding supporting cast including Claude Rains, Sidney Greenstreet (who was so popular that he was teamed again with Peter Lorre in another film shortly after Casablanca), Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt, everything seems effortless in this classic film..That's the best compliment you can give any film. So many undeserving movies have won Academy Awards that it's amazing when a great motion picture actually does win; Casablanca was recognized for writing, direction and best picture. There were a number of deserving nominations for this film (including Bogart but he was rewarded later for a far less deserving portrayal in John Huston's The African Queen) but the Academy elected to share the rest of the wealth with other films.<br />A nearly flawless print and beautiful transfer have been used to produce this remastered edition. The crisp, black and white images look amazingly sharp given the age of the film. The bright and clean look of the film is probably due to significant digital clean up and it was well worth the effort. Although there isn't a huge improvement in terms of image over the previously released DVD from a couple of years ago, the generous extras more than make up for purchasing the film again.<br />Since the original film was recorded and shown in mono, there's not much beyond clean up that can be done here. That said, the film still suffers from the same limited range typical of a film from the same time. The documentaries included on the second disc sound terrific though.<br />There's two strong commentary tracks one by film critic Roger Ebert and the other by film historian Rudy Behlmer. Of the two, I found Ebert's track the most fun and informative at the same time. Behlmer's commentary is fine and provides lots of interesting background and trivia for the viewer but Ebert is the better entertainer.<br />Luckily the usual suspects weren't assembled for this deluxe edition. While the documentary You Must Remember This appeared on the previous edition, the other extras are, for the most part, new and exclusive to this edition. It's inclusion allows fans of the film to replace the earlier edition.<br />Bacall on Bogart provides quite a bit of insight into Bogart. Having Bogart's widow and fellow actor Bacall host the special that was original produced by Turner Entertainment and WNET was a savvy move. Lauren Bacall manages to provide insightful observations about Bogart's career and how he ended up doing Casablanca. Directed by David Heeley and written by John L. Miller, the documentary is breezy and information. The use of clips and stills also benefits the program making the documentary less static than most.<br />A little known fact is that Casablanca also gave birth to a short lived television series. The premiere episode entitled Who Holds Tomorrow? Is an interesting alternative to the film. While the characters and some of the situations are familiar, the pilot provides enough minor surprises to make it worth viewing. Without DVD and the resurrection of Casablanca again, many fans might have been deprived of the chance to see this interesting bit of television history.<br />If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, than Criterion must be blushing. Warner also presents the original radio broadcast by the Screen Guild Players a feature frequently found on many of Criterion's discs of vintage films. What's most interesting is the fact that the trio of top billed stars in the film (Bogart, Bergman and Henreid) perform their parts in this broadcast. It wasn't uncommon during the 30's, 40's and 50's for actors to reprise their roles in special radio adaptions of current films. It's fun having this bit of history included.<br />Finally Warner pulls a rabbit out of its hat. The Bugs Bunny cartoon Carrotblanca with Bugs as Bogie is also included. This hilarious short was produced back in 1995. Although it is missing the breezy direction common to the better classic Warner cartoons, it can more than hold its own against most of them. Carrotblanca looks colorful and vivid in a terrific transfer. If this is what Warner has done to their stable of classic cartoons set for release later in October of 2003, then Looney Tunes fans are in for a treat.<br />Although many fans of the film have probably purchased Casablanca previously on DVD, this deluxe edition has extras galore making it essential. The new print and transfer are vivid and vibrant besting even the earlier edition (which looked very good, indeed).Most film fans would pay a king's ransom to get their special movie treated with as much class and respect as this one. Sure, the usual suspects are present but there's also a whole lot more for fans to view in this  top notch DVD.vations about Bogart's career and how he ended up doing Casablanca.

B000089RVR|4.0|The new Dido album is lovely, and showcases a more accoustic sound, but Dido still manages to be ethereal, intelligent and haunting, which were the qualities that won over the world with &quot;No Angel.&quot; However, there isn't another &quot;Here With Me,&quot; &quot;The Hunter&quot; or &quot;Don't Think of Me,&quot; those spine-chilling masterpieces from her debut...but this one suffices and will keep me happy until Dido graces us with a third album...I love you Dido.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|There were aspects of this film that I was not wowed by, most people already stated the pointless Zion scene.  What I won't say is that I didn't enjoy it, because I did.  I'm a Matrix fan, and I'm still enthralled by the idea this movie tries to portray.  So with that said, I thought it was good for what it was, the middle of a trilogy.  The only thing I hope to see in the next one, which I may not, is more humanity in the characters, they were extremely wooden, and overly stoic(?)in this film.  I wanted to see more animation in their expressions.  The best characters were the French guy and Persimone, because they had simply - character.  I still liked the movie though.
0316666343|5.0|I had read the book Alice Sebold wrote first, her memoir, before I went on to the Lovely Bones. Both great, and I would recommend reading her first book &quot;Lucky,&quot; first, like I did, because I just felt like they went great together and in that sequence. But anyway, I would really recommend this book to anybody. It is written from a different, creative perpective that I think makes the book very unique from others. A lot goes on in the story, and I think anyone who reads it will find they can't put it down, just like I found! I lost my copy of the book in a hospital when I went there for an appointment...I about flipped when I reached the car with my book not in hand! If it doesn't turn up soon, I'm going to have to go out and buy myself another one- I couldn't stand not being able to read the rest of it!! I will be keeping my eye on this author for any future releases.
0451169514|5.0|I can't say much about It.  I read the novel about two years ago, and I think it's a testament to Stephen King's mastery of character that I still remember much of what happened, and much about many of the characters.  Some of the book is forgettable, and it could probably have used one more revision, but there's so much STORY, so much to see and hear and feel, that I don't know if that revision would have been a good idea.  It is by turns dark, funny, thoughtful, and scary, and few books in the pantheon can claim that.  Highly recommended if you're looking for a way to get lost in the shadows for a while.
B00008DDXC|5.0|The Harry Potter books are absolutely wonderful and I was terrified when they released the movie that it be a pathetic shadow of the literary version. But much to my delight, it wasn't. Give or take a few scenes cut for length, the movie is extremely true to the book - probably the best adaption I have ever seen. <BR>The Harry Potter movies are great for children and adults! It is absoultely pure story from beginning to end! It is an extremely enchanting story with great actors! And whoever cast so many wonderful actors in one movie should be given an important award or some type! A great film for the whole family to watch!
B0000C7PSW|3.0|Having listened to his first two albums, I did not expect this album to be one that would need to &quot;grow on me&quot;.  Unfortunately, I had to stop listening about half way through my first try.  He's got an amazing voice but yes, he slurs a lot more which sometimes gives me a headache.<br />Nevertheless, it HAS grown on me and its cool to see how he's trying new things, integrating opera themes and orchestra.  Even after the first disappointment with Want One, I'm pretty sure I'll purchase Want Two, just cos hey its Rufus.  But I still think Poses is his best.
B00000K31Q|4.0|In this adaption of The Taming of The Shrew, Katarina (Julia Stiles) is the pessimistic teenager full of angst and her sister Bianca is the popular girl that everyone pines after who has to find her sister a date in order to accomodate her social life. This movie is much better than your average teen movie - not full of stupid cliches and predictable characters. I enjoyed it very much.
0140072187|5.0|Robert Mason uses a clear, conversational, fast-paced narrative to describe his experiences as an army helicopter pilot from 1965-1967, including a tour of Vietnam.<br />Mason always wanted to fly. Leaving college early, joining the army and becoming a helicopter pilot seemed like the way to do it. After successfully graduating from flight school, he comes to learn that the army has devised a new way to use helicopters in warfare -- and Mason is drawn into the army air cavalry.<br />Mason describes enough of how to fly a huey so you feel that you are right there with him. You experience the fatigue of war. You read as well, the senselessness and brutality of it -- his gunner kills &quot;human shields&quot; in order to get a VC machine gunner, a platoon murders 12 prisoners as revenge for the torture and death of their comrades, a pilot is shot through the helmet yet miraculously survives, a fully laden huey lands in a minefield, and everywhere bodies are piling up faster than the army can take care of.<br />Mason also describes his post-traumatic stress disorder, his panic attacks that start to haunt him towards the end of his tour, and his bouts with alcoholism.<br />There is much in Mason and his fellow soldiers that is admirable. Mason's narrative presents a convincing portrait of the Vietnam war from a soldier's point of view -- a war Mason and many of his fellow soldiers didn't entirely believe in, a war that didn't match the descriptions in the press, or the pronouncements from the generals and the President.
6303269869|5.0|I didn't realize this film came out several years ago and I had never watched it before and just now had to for a class I am taking in college about drugs and alcoholism. This movie was wonderful and there wasn't a dry eye (at least from the ladies) in the room when it was over. It shows what alcoholism can do to a family, the children, the couple and who they thought they were, and who they were when the alcoholism finally came to an end. Even if you don't like the actors, it's definitely worth watching. What's even more amazing is the way he sticks by her, the title of this movie, is truly unique and an excellent choice to go with the theme of the movie.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|Much the same as the exceptionally good 'Heathen', 'Reality' improves with every listen. It takes some time to wrap your head around it and appreciate the distinct sound of each song, but with time it reveals its full beauty. Thematically, this is an album about reality - Bowie's and our own. There are songs of ruined marriage ('She'll Drive the Big Car'), girl trouble ('Pablo Picasso'), getting old ('Never Get Old') and corporate monsters ('Fall Dog Bombs the Moon'). Also there are more Bowie-specific songs, such as 'Days' and 'Bring Me the Disco King', but they are nevertheless very entertaining. Ultimately, 'Reality' is a strong album with a hell of a lot going for it, barring a couple of unfortunate inclusions.<br />So why isn't this a five star album? Mostly, because of the completely over-the-top 'The Loneliest Guy', which is totally hammed up musically and lyrically. Also, the chorus on 'She'll Drive the Big Car' is very dull and does not offer much to the listener; however, the verse on that particular song is very strong. 'Looking For Water' also does not have that much happening underneath. <br />The rest of the album is very good. 'New Killer Star' is exceptionally good, as is 'Pablo Picasso', 'Never Get Old', 'Fall Dog Bombs the Moon', 'Reality' and 'Bring Me the Disco King'. The George Harrison cover of 'Try Some, Buy Some' is very nice, as is the short and sweet 'Days'. Bowie's voice is in fine form throughout and musically there's all sorts of surprises to be had.<br />It's so fantastic that Bowie's back recording strong albums again! I'm definitely looking forward to future releases.
6300213668|5.0|I love this movie more than words could possibly say.  It begins with a boy named Danny falling in love with a girl named Sandy at the beach the summer before their senior year, not knowing they would be in the same high school in the fall.  They had their ups and downs throughout the movie but they loved each other very deeply.  It has some great songs in it too.  Most of them were in the play.  I can play &quot;It's Raining on Prom Night,&quot; on my guitar.  Don't even bother renting this movie, because once you watch it you'll want to see it again and again.
B000066NW0|1.0|1st of all, i would like 2 say that JERRY SYNDER, i totally agree with you, AVRIL IS A FAKE. She cant play guitar, she doesnt write half of da songs, tht she states she wrotes all by herself. and finally, WHY DOES SHE DREES LIKE A PUNK??? I mean seriously, she is POP people, not anytype if rock. And why did they play at metallica's MTv icon show??? That was a disgrace to metallica, even kirk and the lead singer said they dont know why avril played at their show.<BR>But realize this; Avril sux. . .i cant see how u can like her songs. I dont hate &quot;her&quot; type of music, but she sucks at it.<BR>My friend has this cd, and it sux. And i did giv avril a chance, but she just cant be what she wants 2 be, a rock star(gwen stefani, da gurl from da distillers). Speakin of gwen, now theres a rock band, with a gurl singer.  And gwen doesnt take credit 4 all da success of her band, and she just be's herself, not no wanna-be punker.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Once again, we should thank Madonna for giving us another album of great songs with musical range that just can't be found from anybody else in the business right now. I know her ability to re-create herself and stay ahead of everyone else should not surprise anyone, but it still does.  Unlike newer artists Madonna manages to deliver the goods even 20 years into her career. American Life contains amazing songs. This is a great CD from start to finish weather you care for Madonna or not. This is probably closest she's ever come to putting her true self into her songs. Don't be mislead by the title song and \\"Die Another Day\\". This album is the most pleasant surprise of the year. <BR>Bravo. Keep them coming.
630463949X|5.0|'The Dance' is an absolute must - have for all Fleetwood Mac fans, as it was this reunion which brought the famous five back together to make some controlled, superb and thoroughly listenable music! They are all on top form in this video, and although not quite as active on stage as before, they still keep the audience wanting more, with neither a note or a foot out of place throughout. A large portion of the setlist is included, though unfortunately Stevie Nicks' solo smash, 'Stand Back' was not put on the video. Four new songs, and a breathtaking version of Nicks' 'Silver Springs' are featured, as well as an entire live USC marching band for 'Don't Stop' and 'Tusk'.<BR>So all in all, a quintessential part to any pop/rock music fan, and a fine performance from all angles.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ever so much more realistic than scifi shows with gleaming, spotlessly clean spaceships that seem to magically run themselves, Firefly portrayed a spaceship and crew considerably less than gleaming and clean. And, sometimes less than fully functional. And... although the \\"heroes\\" in this case, not quite on the right side of the local laws. In many major TV markets, Fox affiliates broadcast baseball local baseball games. Evidently their deals with the MLB call for them to preempt network shows. That happened here in the San Francisco area. Even Firefly's premere episode got delayed by about 18 minutes (9 of which were commercials!) so those of us recording the program missed a lot of that episode as well as entire other episodes. There are people at Fox who should be punished, but that is another story. Firefly is one of those shows so well written that even people who shun SciFi (my wife) enjoyed it. Instead of being written to a formula, Joss W took the high road with a great mix of the verbal and the visual. I'm not sure what the budget was, but the money was well spent on sets and guest stars. Favorite episode? \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\" by a hair. After seeing it, you tell yourelf that \\"I should have seen that coming\\" but you didn't. Now I/we can enjoy all of the episodes without interruption. Do you think that if enough people buy this DVD set that the SciFi channel might consider reviving the series? Probably not, but a good dream to have.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Diana Krall is an incredible jazz vocalist.  If you love jazz standards this is the CD to buy.  Diana is quite an accomplished musician-her jazz piano skills are very impressive.  Whether it's in the car or in the classroom, this one is a good one to share!
0385504209|2.0|That's about it. There are too many other reviews here for me to feel it necessary to continue. I liked the book, its quite interesting and well written. I'm an academic student of religious history, and his connections are liberal and speculative yet presented as fact.
0812550757|5.0|Amazingly good story. You dont need to have read Ender's Game (the first novel in the series) but it helps. <br />Card constructs incredibly detailed characters. The basic story is uncommon and rich and then the concept of the Speaker itself is wonderful. Card is wonderful in the way his deep and lively characters come together to tell the already great story.<br />Excellent
0385504209|3.0|Mr Brown has really done some fantastic research and he raises some wonderfully perplexing questions about the Christian faith. I found that it made me study more on those questions and look up information about the Knights Templar and the gospel according to Thomas.<br />The downside to this book was that it did not hold my attention as far as the story was concerned. I found it not up to par with many similar books.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|I haven't bought a David Bowie disc for awhile, I have to admit, but after reading some positive reviews of this disc both on here and in other publications, I decided to get it. I am a huge fan of his Ziggy period, and his late 70's Berlin era and Scary Monsters. But after Let's Dance and his relatively mediocre work in the 80's and 90's, I sort of figured he'd had his moment in the sun... but I was sadly mistaken.  This disc is excellent in every sense of the word. The lyrics are wonderful and his band is tight, quirky and contemporary - all the elements of classic Bowie. He is in top form here really.  There are very few (if any) artists who are reaching a peak this late in their career, but Bowie is right there.<br />There isn't a bad cut on this disc. I especially am enjoying &quot;New Killer Star&quot;, &quot;Never get Old&quot;, &quot;Days&quot;, &quot;Fall Dog Bombs The Moon&quot;, and &quot;Bring Me the Disco King&quot; (the true magnum opus of this disc - Bowie hasn't recorded a song like this in years). I also think his version of George Harrison's Try Some Buy Some is utterly amazing. This is an underrated song and Bowie has revealed its true essence. What a fitting tribute to George.<br />If you are a fan of David Bowie - any period - you will enjoy this CD. It is a contemporary sound, but still classic Bowie. I highly recommend it.
B00000DC10|5.0|That's really the only thing you can say about this album.  Every song hits like a 10-ton sledgehammer crashing through the walls that try to confine music in this genre or that genre.  This has been sitting in my collection for seven years and I just now feel like I have enough of a handle on this album to write a review.<br /><br />Obviously thick with punk and metal flourishes, hues of techno, jazz, prog and classical color this album as well, and only a band like Refused could make such a combination work.<br /><br />Not only does the band create a potent amalgamation of several different and seemingly incongruous styles, but Refused also master the tension-filled build-up and the cathartic release, displayed best on 'New Noise' 'Liberation Frequncy' 'Worms of the Senses/Faculties of the Skull' and 'The Deadly Rhythm.'  In each song there's a little lull where you question whether or not you really should be taking Dennis' communist manifestos seriously; then a bombastic wave of factory-floor noise washes the thought out of your head.<br /><br />And this album is hardly hard on the ears.  Sure, the music is heavy and the lyrics are screamed, but the riffs will just keep festering inside your skull until you finally relent and put the album on again for the third time today.  It's that good.<br /><br />Refused's \\"Song's to Fan the Flames of Discontent\\" is another must-own, but \\"The Shape of Punk to Come\\" blows it away.  Every song is a classic, even the throwaway 'Brustist Poem No. 5.'  It says something that an album that came out eight years ago sounds like it would be ahead of its time if it were released today.  \\"The Shape of Punk to Come\\" is that album and you should own it.
B00006JJ1O|1.0|I bought this album and half the songs are in english and the same songs in russian.  It's like buying half an album and playing it twice and paying 2 times the price.  It's a rip off.
B00005221L|5.0|Love the movie. I don't know if it gets better then predator. Ever hear of the game Aliens vs. Predator? Well, predator rules. I mean aliens rocks, but the predator is crazy. Basically Arnold is the man. He is the guy to take down the Predator. There isn't that much talking later in the movie, mostly because there is a vicious killer running around, but there is defintely a sence of... fever. Jungle fever to be exact.<br />Arnold is great in this role. He plays the bad boy gunner perfectly well. He doesn't try to act toooo bad, but he does a great job of taking down the baddies. Anyways, the predator is basically a stealth, nuclear bomb, killer, hunting type creature. It looks like an alien got squashed and swollen or something. Actually it isn't as scary as the aliens, but it is creepy.<br />Compared to Predator 2? Its not even a comparison, this movie rocks compared to Predator 2. DTS really adds to it. The Predator could wipe out a city block, and its really cool to see Arnold take him on. 5 o 5 stars.
B00009TB5G|3.0|I think it would be difficult to dispute that Peter Jackson is an excellent director. However, what remains to be seen is whether or not he is an excellent interpretor, and this seems to be the root of the mixed criticism regarding the second in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, \\"The Two Towers\\". When Tolkien first published this epic trilogy, he honed every nuance and every phrasal reference to what he believed \\"worked\\" within the context of the books. As a professor of English, he could certainly do no less, and he protected his writing from publisher's changes. <BR>Transferring a novel to a film will, of course, require modifications as what \\"works\\" on a page will not always work on screen. To this end, I believe the \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did a fantastic job, and retained the essence of the novels without betraying their thematic elements. However \\"The Two Towers\\", while visually appealing and ultimately epic in scope, almost seems a change in trend in the style of interpretation. As other reviewers have mentioned, elements such as Faramir's character, the battle of Helm's Deep, details regarding Isengard etc. were all massively rewritten to the point where themes were actually changed. Case in point, a central theme of nature (represented by the Ents and their forest), vs. industry (the Orcs), demonstrated in the novel by the Forest \\"consuming\\" the Orcs of Isengard destroying Saruman's army at Helm's Deep is somewhat uncreatively replaced by the elves coming to Man's rescue in fighting them off. <BR>Whether or not such revision is good or bad for the sake of the audience is a moot point, as \\"The Two Towers\\" was even more successful than \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\". But films are a form of artistic expression, just as novels are, and when art imitates art, moviemakers must be careful not to paint over the authors work, while keeping the signature intact.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|Das Geheimnis Pattons ist die Vergangenheit, says a captain in the German high command. Pattons secret is the past. The secret of the man and the movie.<br />From the moment Patton opens, you know this will be like no other war movie. Standing before the biggest American flag Ive ever seen, General George S. Patton Jr. wears a highly buffed, black helmet and a uniform suggesting the 18th or 19th century, weighed down with medals domestic and foreign, bearing not one but two ivory-handled revolvers, and holding a riding crop. As a bugler plays To the Colors,\\" the camera focuses on each feature in turn. And then Scott lets loose with the pictures famous monologue (an edited version of a speech he actually gave to American troops in England on the eve of D-Day).<br />Now I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.<br />Atten  tion!<br />Consider the time. In 1969, when Patton was made, America was mired in an unpopular war in Vietnam, the draft was just about to be ended, and America was preparing to pull her fighting men out of the first military defeat in her history. Many who supported the war effort, felt the military had been sabotaged by the media. And here was this spirit from the past, saying that Americans love to fight, and will not tolerate a loser!<br />Early in Patton, we hear the sound of distant trumpets, as in 1943, the general surveys the ancient battlefield where Carthage (modern name, Tunis, in Tunisia) was burnt to the ground by the Romans in 146 B.C.<br />Patton is standing near the Kasserine Pass in Tunisia, where over 1,000 American G.I.s were butchered in their first encounter with the German Wehrmacht, in the form of Field Marshal Erwin Rommels Afrika Korps. I was there, he tells his assistant. In 146 B.C.<br />Is he mad or is he teasing? The answer is, a little of both.<br />He quotesfrom a lush, romantic poem of the eternal warrior  he is the poet. An American poet-general? Clearly, we are dealing with a man singular in the annals of 20th century American warfare. I hate the 20th century, the old cavalry horse officer remarks.<br />He refers to himself as a prima donna, but as director Franklin Schaffner, scenarists Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, and star George C. Scott portray him, megalomaniac is more like it. Before going in to battle, as he stands before his mirror, his Negro soldier-valet carefully placing his begoggled helmet on his head, he more closely resembles a Roman general (or Il Duce) than a modern officer. And in a notorious, true incident, upon encountering a shell-shocked soldier, he slaps the man silly, threatens to shoot him, and is almost cashiered by Ike. But he was our greatest 20th century field commander.<br />(The valet is played by a trim, youthful-looking, fifty-year-old Jimmy Edwards. Unfortunately, Edwards (Home of the Brave, Bright Victory, The Member of the Wedding, The Manchurian Candidate, etc.), whose career was limited by racism, died of a massive heart attack before the films release. He went through hell, paving the way so that the likes of Sidney Poitier and Denzel Washington could become screen icons, while he was forgotten.)<br />In Pattons brutality, in his talk of never giving up an inch of land (Hitler said the very same thing.), in his contempt for civilian authority, in his joy at killing, he comes across as a fascist or Nazi, which is how he was often depicted at the time. Amazingly, the movie is able to glorify this man, while maintaining a posture of cold sentimentality towards him. Schaffner loves Patton, but without illusions. Patton wasnt larger than life  no one is - he WAS life, or at least the martial, intellectual, and aesthetic lives, in all their fullness.<br />George Patton Jr. had a sense of destiny; his purpose in life was to achieve greatness leading desperate men in combat. And as he observes, only once in a thousand years, do the heavens so align themselves that a soldier has such an opportunity to change history.<br />Fortunately, in the movie as in life, Patton had humble, ordinary Joe - at least as Bradley tells it - Gen. Omar Bradley (the last five-star, General of the Army, in the history of the U.S. Army) as a counterweight. Bradley is played by Karl Malden with a restraint and self-effacing humor that perfectly contrast Patton/Scotts bravado.<br />Jerry Goldsmiths score has just the right blend of the elegiac (distant trumpets) and the pompous yet playful (fanfare of horns and flutes), corresponding to the tempers of Pattons personality.<br />While almost three hours long, Patton does not flag, and could easily have been longer.<br />The DVD has a lovely documentary on the making of Patton, as well as Jerry Goldsmiths rousing score.<br />Just as Patton could not savor his success, so too George C. Scott, the rare actor who could carry a film on his shoulders, was unable to build on his success as Patton. But for one moment, he tasted of that perfection that comes when the stars align, and a great role is delivered into the hands of just the right actor at just the right moment in his career. It was George C. Scotts destiny to play Patton.<br />Originally published in The Critical Critic, September 20, 2003.
B0007QS1VW|1.0|Why people buy this? <br /> <br />I dont know. <br /> <br />This is a bad dvd.  <br /> <br />Buy Roger Waters dvd \\"in the flesh\\"; best music dvd ever. <br /> <br />Dont buy PULSE dvd. This is fake dvd. The first part is some new stuff from pink floyd(extr bad) <br /> <br />The second part(like tribute band) <br /> <br /> <br />WARNING!!!!! <br /> <br />DONT BUY
B00005JLXE|1.0|First of all, this is not my type of movie at all, but Colin Farrell was in it and my Husband was interseted so I decided to give it a try. UGH. This movie was sooo bad. The acting(if you can call it that), the plot....(was there one?)....the whole thing was so cheesy I cringed with discomfort while watching...I eventually fell asleep towards the end ..I honestly feel that being passed out on my couch was better time spent than witnessing the conclusion to this mindless mess of a movie. All I can say is that this just further reinforces my belief that if you want a GOOD story, skip the movies and read a book instead.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|This album has made Nickelback my favorite band!  I listen to it on all my marathon training runs now!  It makes me run a little bit too fast, but I look forward to running everyday now!  I cannot WAIT for the concert!
B00008PC2O|2.0|People need to stop acting like this DVD is all new. It isn't that new. You want the best Terminator 2 dvd? Buy the one with thes stainless steel cover. That one has the terminator 2 special edition.<br />This comes with 3 versions(sound familiar?). One of the reviews on here said something like, &quot;You get 3 really awesome new versions!&quot; You don't. You get the theatrical which is not the best but I like it sometimes. You get the special edition with the basically 15 new minutes of extended footage. They worked in the footage perfectly, so it looks just like new. It isn't like xmen where the footage is just added in. The footage here is actually worked in. The third version is alright, but the special edition is the best. The only weird thing is, the other special edition that I told you about has all 3 of these versions plus DTS worked in for all of them.<br />Anyways, I would just buy the original special edition. There is the basic t2 dvd, which is cheap but not that great. There is the special edition, which is exactly like this one, but ill tell you the difference in a minute. Then there is this one, like the other special eddition but missing something. I mean the footage is the same but...<br />NO DTS. I don't really care about the extras, i bought this for the movie. The other special edition has DTS and PLENTY of extras. I would not buy this dvd. You can get a cheaper one with DTS. Think about it. Cheap DVD + DTS = AWESOME. Then there is Expensive DVD + NO DTS = NOT GREAT.<br />Thats the only difference I can see. The extras? They are fine. But, the dvd. DTS, must have dts. Picture is fine in both versions, but no DTS. If you do not have a DTS decoder would I reccomend this? No. You may buy a DTS decoder some day, then you will want to rebuy the movie, so just buy the original special edition, not the EXTREME edition.
B00005JLSE|4.0|First, the DVD is vivid, the sound is excellent.  As to the essence of the story, I have read reviews here that seem to demand a certain &quot;style&quot; to musicals - happy, uplifting, a champagne toast to life.  In other words, singing nuns, either flying or climbing over mountains.  Musicals are dramas, first.  Cynicism, dispair, murder, death - these are all part of dramas.  Many people don't like &quot;Oklahoma&quot; because of the character of Judd, a murderous loner, who brings tragedy.  &quot;Carousel&quot; tells a story of Billy, a man who learns too late to love, and causes tragedy to those around him.  Both of these musicals are standards of the American theatre.  &quot;The Thre Penny Opera&quot; has its supporters and its detractors, but who would deny that it is art?  Some reviewers quoted here appear to loathe &quot;Chicago&quot; as a downer.  They appear to want a return to the fantasy-type of musical so popular from the 20's to the 70's.  They do not want any deviation from the &quot;formula.&quot; Admittedly, &quot;Chicago&quot; is meant for adults.  What's wrong with that?  Not everything is &quot;Chitty, Chitty Bang Bang,&quot; which most critics dismissed for being far too out of touch with our current cultural sensitities.  I don't like a lot of movies that have been declared &quot;Best Picture,&quot; but it's only the Oscars, after all.  The Academy doesn't dictate what I see (or don't see).  I make up my own mind.  I enjoyed &quot;Chicago&quot; on DVD (I saw it on Broadway in 1979 and enjoyed it then).
B00000I8BX|5.0|This CD is awesome, especially with the bonus of &quot;Cars&quot; with Gary Neuman doing (some) of the vocals. If your neighbors are really angering you, pop this in and play on 11 until the cops come and laugh when they hand you a ticket!<br />Brutal follow up to any of their previous releases!<BR>A+!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000089RVR|5.0|Many other reviewers have commented that this album debuts a more stripped down sound for Dido.  Is this a bad thing?  I think not.  Dido no longer hides behind as many walls of sound as on her first album.  Her voice becomes the central instrument, and this can only be a good thing.  It highlights that she is a versatile singer, more confident and in control.  She doesn't need all of those synthesizers droning on in the background.  She has emerged as a truly capable artist, not just another overproduced pop phenom.<br />Besides, I woudn't exactly qualify Dido's first album as the holy grail - it had its up and downs, and its stripped down songs as well.  Although this album has fewer standout &quot;single-worthy&quot; tracks than &quot;No Angel&quot;, I find it to be more consistently compelling, and written with more focus on poetry.  Not that this is a heady album, Dido just expresses what she wants to say (generally speaking) in a more succint, colorful way than on her first album. <br />Highlights are White Flag, a more &quot;drenched in sound&quot; style tune with a great hook; Don't Leave Home is a deceptively simple meditation on wants and needs; Sand In My Shoes has beautifully shimmering harmonies.  Do You Have A LIttle Time ventures into some interesting fusion of strings and spanish guitars.  This Land Is Mine has a great acoustic rock sound, and See The Sun is a true pop epic - it really rocks too.  This album is an enjoyable listen all the way through.  If you are a fan of honest pop/rock in a world of posturing you should pick up this CD.
0786915749|3.0|I must say that I was slightly disapointed in this book.I decided to read it after hearing about it in an online chat. After a chapter or two, I realized I'd hurd this story before...several times. Elves, dwarves, little people-it's all been down before. The charectors had flimsy and unoriganal personalities, the plot was somewhat random and disorderly. Don't get me wrong, it had it's good points(who doesn't like a good sword fight every now and then) It just lacked the basic spark of imagination that makes fantasy novels so wonderful.
0440211727|5.0|This book is awesome. There I said it. Anyway, while on her way home, little black girl is raped by two sick rednecks who find this pleasurable. She's put in a hospital and the father decides to take matters into his own hands. He blows the two men away with a gun he bought from a gangster and ends up in jail. This event gets the attention of a young lawyer named Jake Brigance who is getting legal advice from drunk has been lawyer. He decides to help the man and faces the consequences of getting death threats via the telephone. Its a powerful book and i must say its one of my favorites.
0142000663|3.0|If you don't mind getting dropped at the end of a story, The Grapes Of Wrath is the novel for you. It is a marvelous story of the Joad's struggle across the country to California to make a living for themselves after their farm was reposed by the bank. You follow them every step of the way through different problems; death, starvation, jobs, and cops. You gain a kind of bond with and empathy for the characters. You care about what happens to every member of the Joad family. You would be sad if they never made it, but at least you would know what happened to them. You never find out. In the middle of a crisis Steinbeck decides to drop you like yesterday's sour milk. It drove me nuts.<br /><br />If Steinbeck had had some sort of ending to the story, it would have been the best story I have ever read. It has no ending. The book is like one of those really annoying sequels that draws you in, gets you addicted, and then says to be continued. Well it is just your luck that you don't get a sequel; there is no to be continued.<br />Other than the minor detail with the terrible ending, it is well written with a style that is easily comprehended. Anyone could read this book. It has what I like to call &quot;story relief chapters&quot;; that is a chapter between each chapter on the main story. These specific chapters give you a view at the world around the Joads smoothly. These chapters don't even mess up the flow of the story.<br />So in conclusion, this book is well written with no ending. I give it three stars because a book can't only have a good story, but it must have a good ending (or any ending for that fact). You can judge it for yourself if you do read it, but that is my review.
0312319517|2.0|&quot;Have you ever read Frederick Forsyth?&quot;, a friend asked waving his latest novel, The Avenger.  I wasn't sure.  Vaguely, I thought of Forsyth being somewhat similar a writer to Harold Robbins, Sidney Sheldon -- all authors for whom I would not at all be surprised if it was true that some of them DICTATE their books to secretaries.  &quot;Read it!&quot;, my Dutch-Suriname friend said -- &quot;it's the only book where our two countries meet!&quot;  So I did it, for her.  And now she owes me big time.<br />No way would The Avenger &quot;convert&quot; anyone who takes up a book to read for reasons other than just so that the time passes more quickly.  No way would it disappoint anyone who does.  It's a good story but I thought it was the worst novel I can remember reading.  The characters are sketchy, anyone is either a &quot;good guy or a bad guy&quot;, their sentiments, emotions, reasoning are given only in rudiments if not entirely absent from the narrative.  Cal Dexter, the main character, has risen above the blue-collar environment of his father's by hard work and perseverance, finished a law school and after internship in a prestigious law firm decides to work impossible hours as a public defender because of job satisfaction he derives from helping the underprivileged.  With such devotion and empathy one would imagine he would have managed to make a more transparent and open family life with his loving wife and daughter.  Instead, one day, out of nowhere, his blooming teenage daughter runs away from home, in protest after Dexter did not approve of her boyfriend.  He has a strong intuition, you see, his gut instinct that has proven life-saving in Vietnam and that has served him well throughout his life told him there was something wrong with this guy and with all that empathy, understanding, love, verbal skills of an effective public defender, the best he does in articulating his disapproval to his beautiful daughter is one firm &quot;No.&quot;  His daughter soon ends up forced in prostitution and drug addiction and is savagely raped and killed.  He disappears to Central America to trace and kill the leader of the gang who did this to his daughter, and when he comes back -- wouldn't you know it -- his wife has committed suicide out of guilt because she was encouraging about her daughter's affection to the boyfriend.  Of course, all this just passed by our hero -- he had no idea of something troubling his wife or daughter... Coming from Forsyth Americans are portrayed as patronizing red-necks who can force anyone into submission either by force or by waving handful of dollars.  Adversaries are incompetent fools or pompous idiots causing annoyance at most.  Our guy just walks in and does what needs to be done, Schwarzenegger-style.  In the end of his main mission, after planning his entry to a small, corrupted Latin American country of refuge of the Serb villain he is to bring back to justice in America, he carefully observes the fortified compound of three and half square miles with elaborate safety arrangements (barbed wire, fences, piranhas, sharks, a dozen of blood thirsty Doberman dogs, 200 armed guards, an elite squad of South African guards, cameras, radars...) and what was the greatest difficulty Dexter faced in snatching the Serb mass murderer?  Well, he got really sweaty, you see.  Actually, there was something courageous Dexter did in his tracing the renegade criminal but it went unnoticed: Dexter boarded JAT (Yugoslav airline company) to fly from Belgrade to Beirut.  Now that's something I am not sure I would have the guts to do myself...<br />Forsyth must have had  map upside down when doing research about former Yugoslavia:  Belgrade is not south (?) of Travnik, for instance.  Pale, Sarajevo and Banja Luka are not north of Belgrade.  Or, what on earth did Forsyth mean by SEVEN provinces of former Yugoslavia -- it's either six or eight: there were six federal republics and in Serbia there were two autonomous provinces.  In bringing to the reader the complexities of war in former Yugoslavia, we will learn that Croatia got &quot;irresponsibly premature recognition by the German chancellor&quot; (p. 26) and yet after 78 days of NATO bombing Serbia, &quot;the Serbs began to mutter it was the mad Milosevic who had brought this ruin upon them.  It is always educational to note how the war fever fades when the roof falls in.&quot; (p. 122).  As a Croat living in Croatia until 1997, I also thought this was very educational indeed, and a further proof that international recognition of any of the 6 federal units (countries) of former Yugoslavia was all but premature.  &quot;Bosnia&quot;, we read, &quot;was a UN affair until finally, in exasperation, taken over and resolved by the USA.&quot; (p. 73)<br />The scenes and how Forsythe lines them, I thought, made it easy to imagine this novel as a film.  There were some impressive thrillers done on the basis of his novels but I don't expect this one to become one.  It would be a kind of unengaged escapist action movie in which the main role was played by someone like Jean-Claude van Damme or Steven Segal.  Time may pass quickly, true, but in my case it was mostly time wasted.  What McDonalds' is to cuisine, The Avenger is to literature.  Be careful about your diet.
B00005K3LU|5.0|This movie absolutely kicks major ass!!! Bruce Willis is the best in this movie and Alan Rickman is a great evil terrorist. My advice: buy this movie and the other Die Hards. They are the greatest collection to have and in my opinion the best action movies of all time.
B0000AMRJC|2.0|The digital video transfer and 5.1 DTS surround sound they said would be included in this DVD was a complete lie.  The sound is just as horrible as it was in the original DVD, as you hear &quot;pops&quot; for gun shots and explosions.  And the video is just as grainy and dark.  It's truly a shame that such a great movie can be tainted with such a horrible DVD.  If you have the original DVD, I wouldn't waste your money or get your hopes up on this DVD.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show's great - nuff said. But does anyone know of any plans to release this DVD in other regions? Otherwise I am heartbroken! If anyone from Fox is reading this - then please please give the rest of the world a chance to get this without having to go and get a new DVD player (yes, I know, anyone with any foresight would have bought a multi-region player in the first place - ah hindsight!) Hint - region 2 would be great...
0385504209|5.0|I read 'The Da Vinci Code' from cover to cover in two days - it was absolutely riveting! Beside being an exciting story, I also loved the details on ancient symbolisms, religious overtones, mathematical tidbits (e.g. phi) and settings in one of my favourite cities, Paris.<br />Kudos to Dan Brown!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Easily the best live music DVD I own. Since I was not lucky enough to see them in person, this proves that they are definitely one of the best rock and roll bands ever. Sure, some of the footage has been edited, but that can be overlooked as the sound is simply amazing. You can't go wrong with over 5 hours of footage and music spanning their career...
B000002J1M|5.0|If you're even thinking about this record, just go ahead and do it right now.<br />Supper's ready is perhaps the greatest single song ever composed.<br />Whereas Nursery Chryme starts with a bang and then sorta peeters out for me, Foxtrot delivers throughout.<br />As a side note, if you ever hear about a band called &quot;The Musical Box&quot; don't hesitate to go see them.  They will blow your mind.<br />They are technically a gabriel Era genesis tribute band, but in reality they are far more.<br />They recreate every detail of classic genesis tours.<br />The Guitarist sounds like Hackett, the Keyboard player plays like Banks, The Bassist plays liek Rutherford and as if that weren't enough, the singer not only recreates every costume and wild antic of Gabriel, but he approximates that sound of Gabriel's voice to a downright creepy degree.  If you didn't know better, you'd think Peter was singing.  I kid you not.<br />As if ALL that weren't enough, the Drummer not only looks like Phil, he not only can play like phil, but he actually sings like phil.  The guy acts with Phil's mannerisms and when he opens his mouth to speak and or sing a song like more fool me, you'd think Phil was singing.<br />Sounds too good to be true and in a way it is.  Though they are canadian, they mostly tour europe.<br />They're unbelievable though.  One of the greatest concert experiences I've ever had.  when the lights go down and the opening chords of watcher of the skies begin, you'd think you had suddenly been transported to 1973.  They use the same instruments genesis used and the same sets.<br />If you like gabriel era genesis... you simply HAVE to see this band.  I'm not kidding you.  I saw them for the first time about a month ago in Atlantic City and I was blown away.  If you think it's going to be like &quot;The Machine&quot; or &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; don't worry.  It's nothing like those Tribute bands.  This one is downright terrifying.  <br />Don't miss them and buy Foxtrot right now.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Normally I hate remakes of original tracks, but in this case Jethro Tull blew me away. With Ian Anderson's vocals elevating to heights not heard in over 15 years, the JT Christmas Album is just that --- an ALBUM that could have been made 25 years ago. Awesome renditions of Ring Out Solstice Bells, Weathercock, Fires at Midnight, and Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow make this a standout Tull compilation that is a MUST BUY for anyone who loved Tull in their 70s heyday. Of course, there are many brand new Christmas songs on this album, and even THEY sound like the Tull of old, including some wonderful instrumentals. My only complaint would be the jazzier treatment on one or two instrumentals, but even those sound better after a few listens.   Five stars.
B000089RVX|5.0|With a teenager in the house, I am force-fed with MTV. I do not particularly care for most of the music presented there, BUT, there is always the odd exeption. As when I heard Evanescence the first time. Amy Lee's voice was particularly capturing, how she was able to put that much force on the high tones and turn singing into an athletic performance.<BR>My favourite track on the CD is actually &quot;Hello&quot;. Not because of the text, I admit I rarely pay attention to texts, but because the melody she sings seems to be more of a background tune/line. Here it is put up front and accompanied by a more lively piano, and the result is unusual and surprisingly beautiful.<br />I see that Evanescence will be in Germany in October, so I better go and get a ticket for my daughter. She will love that. And who knows, maybe I'll get one for me, too.
B000067CPX|5.0|Definitely their best disc since BLOOD, SUGAR. One of the few discs these days that you can actually listen to straight through and enjoy every song. This disc just grows on you the more you listen to it. Possibly the best release of 2002...
B00005OMTT|5.0|This was my first ever Enigma CD. I loved it so much that I bought all the other Enigma CDs afterwards. I love the chanting monks and Sandra's sexy voice. My favorite song is ''Return to Innocence''. The songs are great, some you can dance, others you could just relax to. This is a must for any Enigma fan!!!!!
B000065BPB|5.0|I bought these cans from amazon to replace ear buds that I used for my computer. This is a well made product, but my only gripe is the plastic construction. However there is a 2 year warranty so I don't think I should worry too much! Before buying these cans, I had a long, long decision on whether to get these or the Grado SR85. A slightly lower price and these being circum-aural and closed, I went with these. I have no regrets buying these. One person mentioned that there is weak bass for these cans and I will have to agree right now. I haven't allowed mine to be broken in yet. Despite this, you can increase the bass in the sound properties which I find to promptly fix this problem! I suspect that I'll be using these cans more than my desktop speakers!
B00005JKED|5.0|I watched this DVD for the 8th time the other night and I still sit here in awe. Sure, it would not have even been close to being worthy of five stars if it wasn't for the stellar performance by Denzel Washington.  Two stars could have easily been taken away due to the fact that this storyline has been rehashed in several other films. But, his performance!! D@mn!! Very few actors can do a complete flip flop in character like Denzel has done in the movie. In the past he has played nothing other than a calm, cool and collective character. For anyone to say that he wasnt worthy of the oscar that he won for best actor needs to check themselves. Who should have won then? Russell Crowe for Beautiful Mind? The book made that movie. In that movie, Crowe played the same expressionless pasty faced character that he always plays.... just add some mumbling and fumbling in and you have Dr. Nash. Sure, Russell is a good actor but we have yet to see him take a role that will show us exactly how versatile his acting ablilities are.
B00005K3NY|2.0|I saw this with a friend based on the fact that he said there was an exploding head scene.  There definitely was and it was truly disgusting, which was nice but the movie was pretty awful all around.  Like many have said the transfer from VHS to DVD was not kind to this film and at a certain point in the movie the voices are not following the mouths of the actors.  The acting was pretty awful too if you ask me.  I can't believe this is called an essential film by Amazon when this truly is just a rather weak attempt at science fiction.  I guess it is worth seeing for the head explosion and the ending scene, but if you want to see a quality movie I would look elsewhere.
6304806418|5.0|This film is extremely entertaining, Madonna with her re-trained voice sang beautifully, and the music was perfect for her.  Antonio Banderas was a complete surprise with his performance (and he had the appropriate accent, unlike the famous &quot;Che&quot; of stage-performance days).  The story, however, departs significantly from real history in omitting the overwhelming majority of the Perons' unsavory aspects.  They essentially were dictators, constantly fearing rebellion by unions and/or the military, while they looted the Argentine nation and feathered their own wealth.  They ran a police state wherein a mere expression of &quot;disrespect&quot; for Evita -- such as laughing at the wrong time, when she spoke -- would lead to a three-year prison sentence.  Others received worse treatment, being evicted from the country or imprisoned within a system that freely used torture.  <br />Read some real history about the Perons, before you proclaim Evita a saint -- but at the same time, enjoy the film, so long as you realize that it is highly over-romanticized.
0385493622|5.0|I just finished Fermat's Enigma.  I'm a complete layman and math no-nothing, but I loved this book's examination of the history of the mathematicians and mathematics that would ultimately lead to Wiles proof.  Well written, excellent explanations of the math involved and great historical background that will *not* put you to sleep!
0380789019|5.0|Unlike a previous reviewer, I think Gaiman IS the Bradbury of our time, and could read this book over and over.  His fresh and unique descriptive prose is not only a wonderful novelty in the current world of the George R R Martin, Terry Goodkind-style  droning epic:  his plots are unique and complex.  Characters are well-developed, interesting, and have a personal relevance to the reader that is woefully lacking in modern SF&amp;F.<br />It's not just a fun story: it's damn well-written.
B000069AUI|5.0|I have been a big fan of Coldplay since Parachutes came out almost 3 years ago.  I remember that I had bought that album from hearing &quot;Shiver&quot; on the radio a couple times- I could tell by listening to that song that the band who made it had something really special going on.  That album became one of my favorites very quickly.  When A Rush of Blood to the Head came out I quickly bought it.  I had heard &quot;In My Place&quot; on the radio a couple of times, and I thought that their sophomore effort would be a simple improvement on what they had already espablished. I started listening to the album in the car on the way home after I bought it, and when I got to my street I just kept driving.  This CD took me by suprise, and it has become one of the best I have ever listened to.  Ever.  Those are bold words but they are justified.  Maybe it's just me, but I could truly connect with the energy held in every song.  This album is completely flawless.  &quot;The Scientist&quot;, the bands third single from the record, is a song that is so good that it is almost uncomfortable to listen to with someone else in the room.  It hits your heart and the base of your spine and you get goosebumps; you can't help it.  &quot;Amsterdam&quot; is a soulful song that will leave you wishing it would go on just a little bit longer.  &quot;Green Eyes&quot; takes you by pleasant suprise; it's chords and structure are no shock, but the style it's played in is a new sound.  &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot; is a very capturing song, cynical and epic at the same time.  I could site every song on the record and have nothing but good things to say about it.  Listen, if you're sitting there wondering whether or not to buy this cd, take my word for it: you will not be let down.  It is everything all the critics have said and more.  You need to get it; it's that simple.  And after it becomes one of your favorites, be sure to tell you friends.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Comparing Radiohead to some derivative pre-teen dance pop, or 80's Euro-pop for that matter, is laughable not just because one is better than the other (opinions are subjective), but because it's a completely different style, genre, and generation. However, while we're comparing, someone should ask the &quot;brilliant&quot; Justin Timberlake what he thinks of Radiohead - he was at the September 28 concert in San Diego.<BR> <BR>In my experience, people that don't appreciate Radiohead either do not actually listen to music (preferring background noise or simplistic lyric-driven songs), or they haven't heard enough music to be consciously aware of anything more than a catchy riff or chorus. This is probably why much of Radiohead's fan base is in their 30's and 40's. It's fine to dislike them, but anyone that has actually listened to a good portion of this album (in one sitting - not thirty seconds at a time) and still refuses to at least acknowledge their talent shows a lack of sophistication and experience.<BR> <BR>Radiohead experiments, and it doesn't always work. Radiohead fans are the first to admit that. But it frequently does work, and the result is often an ecstatic emotional journey. I won't try to describe the music and why it does this, other reviewers have done a great job of that. One journalist recently wrote something to the effect of &quot;Radiohead finds beauty in the darkest places&quot;, which is as good a way to describe them as any.<BR> <BR>Few artists have enough songs to fill a &quot;greatest hits&quot; album with nothing but truly great songs - Bowie and Joy Division come to mind. In the case of OK Computer, Radiohead nearly accomplished this with a single release. After seeing the San Diego show, I was putting together a compilation for some curious friends to try out, and of the 15 favorite tracks I came up with, 8 were from OK Computer. This is the only album I've ever encountered that is this consistently inspired. Highly recommended.
6305014140|5.0|Ninja Scroll is on the edge of being hentai, lots of violence, gore, sex, rape, etc. But that dosen't offend me in the slightist! I'm f***ing sick of all that bubblegum anime crap on the market today. I'm looking for something a little more mature. I'm not saying that this is just mindless brutality... I'm just saying that this is anime for big kids. The story is not THAT original, but It's not linear in the slightist. The caracter's profiles were well-done. And the animation is superb, despite the blood looked a little vermillion at times. The accuracy to real ancient Japan was very swishy. But this story is fantasy anyway, so It dosen't have to be. The ending was a little depressing, but atleast it dosen't go down that overwalked path of how the protagonist meets a mate, and they live happily ever after. The sex/violence isn't all the hype I claim it to be, It's no worse than an R-rated move. The sex scene were a little unneccecary at some points, but It always adds a little spice to the movie! The sound quality was well done also, the sound of people screaming when they are being killed was moderatly realistic. A sequal to this movie would sort of ruin the sentimental value of the ending, but I would be interested to see where Jubei moves on to. Anime fans should get this if they can handle the grotesque factors. <BR>WARNING!!! : Small children whom are subjected to this film may be traumatized for life, please view responsably.
1400049628|1.0|What a waste of money and time. This guy is way  TOO serious, and from this boring survivalist guide, seen too many Romero movies. He claims zombies are real and his findings are based on real incidences. Fear not, many have checked his sources and found they are all ficticious. Well, with a father like Mel Brooks, what can you expect.<br />Don't waste your money. See Night of the Living Dead instead.
0385504209|5.0|I read this book about a week before I went to Paris and felt compelled to go to Saint-Sulpice and look for the Rose Line.  I figured I was just being a big dork, but then I noticed three couples searching the floor of the church.  I studied them for a while and then said, \\"Davinci Code?\\"  To which they all began to laugh and responded with a yes.<br />One of the couples scanning the floor of the church informed me that they had just been in Rome and while there they followed the quest in Angels and Demons, through the city.

B00008EY9G|3.0|I won't go into the plot of this film, since it's been described quite well in many other reviews. I enjoy horror and suspense films, and this one was a lot of fun to watch. The set up is great, and watching the clues unfold is a lot of fun. I really liked the old fashioned &quot;trapped in a hotel with a killer&quot; premise, but within thirty minutes I'd figured out who was doing the murders, and was hoping I was wrong (it seemed too clich&eacute;d, but no, I wasn't wrong).<br />I also agree with previous reviewers that the &quot;twist&quot; was delivered a little too soon, and the ending, at least to me, was no surprise -- pretty much your standard horror film ending. Still, the point of the movie for me wasn't in the way it ended or even in the twist, but in watching the characters interact and eventually begin to figure out what was happening to them.<br />I was glad to find out on this website the deal with the so-called &quot;alternative ending,&quot; because I sure as heck didn't notice any differences.<br />Overall the film is a lot of fun and made for entertaining viewing. Nothing spectacular, but an enjoyable movie.
B0000042H4|5.0|Fans of Birgit Nilsson, take heart!!! If you love her voice, there is an even better recording under Testament - #1200  &amp; #1201. It's called Wagner: Opera Arias &amp; Duets conducted by Leopold Ludwig with Hans Hotter as Wotan (Testament #1201). The second one is called Birgit Nilsson: Opera Arias conducted by Leopold Ludwig and Wallberg (Testament #1200). The two recordings, in superb stereo, were produced by Walter Legge the legendary perfectionist producer!! In the 2 recordings, Birgit Nilsson is recorded closer to the microphones so that her voice is even more thrillingly captured. If you like Birgit Nilsson, don't hesistate buying it. It's like Joan Sutherland's &quot;Art of Prima Donna&quot;, Leonie Rysanek's &quot;Italian Operatic Arias&quot;, Eileen Farrell's &quot;Eileen Farrell sings Verdi&quot; and Christa Ludwig's &quot;Celebrating Christa Ludwig - RCA Recitals of Brunnhilde, Ariadne, Dyer's Wife and Elektra&quot; - a true classic of the gramophone.

B00003XB8K|2.0|Cretu's pretty lazy attempt of producing an album with something new to offer.  It is typical Enigma but not the good kind.  I remember being surprised with a few old tracks from Enigma.  When I thought Cretu's musical genre was somewhat restrictive, I was rather impressed with different exotic instruments, sounds and vocals, experimental beats and sound samples.  The Eyes Of Truth and Carly's Song (The Age Of Loneliness) will always be my absolute favourite Enigma tracks because they're so soulful, passionate and dramatic and they sound very different to the others.  I was hoping with the turn of the new age that Cretu would incorporate a new wave of inspiration and energy into his music and show us all that Enigma is still strong and ahead of its time.  I still feel that there is a great deal more that Enigma can offer, something new and innovative much like when in its prime during the early 90s.  This doesn't necessarily mean they have to conform to the current musical trends and get all tech'd up with 'phatt beats'.  Look at artists like Bjork and Massive Attack for example.  They still stay true to their own form yet they experiment with new sounds and mediums and come up with an album which shows how they have evolved.  I will be totally disappointed with Enigma if this is the last album because I still expect to hear something different.  I refuse to believe that Cretu can compose and produce such spellbinding music which still blows me away like the biggest tracks on Cross Of Changes yet there's nothing more to top it off.  This album was repetitive and weak.
B000068MKZ|5.0|Free-spirited and girly, yet sexy and passionate, this is a great album from Carla Bruni. I first heard this in a Youth Hostel in Lyon, and it is still on regular rotation now i am at home. Not only is Carla Bruni a beautiful model, but she is also a talented musician, singing and playing guitar on this album, as well as writing much of it herself. You don't need to know French to appreciate this album, as its (mainly) happy mood will take you to the cafes of France on its own. Well worth searching for.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Billy, Maynard, and Josh have combined to put out another great album.  This time with the help of Jordie (from Marilyn Manson) and James (Smashing Pumpkins).  It is a bit more mellow this time around, but that takes nothing away from its greatness. Maynard's vocals transcend far beyond what listeners can fathom.  The lyrics are great, no matter what level you take them as.  They are probably a lot deeper than I can go, but I enjoy them on my own level.  Josh Freese proves why he is one the best drummers around.  Well, the point of this is to say It's a great album.  Energetic, mellow, beautiful.  BUY IT
B000009EAD|3.0|Firstly, Iced Earth is a band who knows how to make album covers.  \\"Eye-candy\\" doesn't come close to describing the sheer aesthetic perfection that it achieves.  But this doesn't necessarily belittle their music.  My review could be a bit more complete were I to have listened to all of their work prior to this album, which I sadly have not.  But you will find varied feedback from me on \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\".<br /><br />For some odd reason, I had always associated Iced Earth with Blind Guardian (they toured together, they thank each other in their Credits, BG also has nice covers).  This association was a weak and incorrect one.  Iced Earth is much more raw and straight-out (as opposed to Blind Guardian, which is more polished and elaborate).  One could consider Iced Earth as the midpoint between Blind Guardian and In Flames.  But let's get down to the album.<br /><br />The album can be encapsulated by the opening song, \\"Burning Times\\", a song that demonstrates Iced Earth's musical variety: showcasing harmonizing guitars, singer Matthew Barlow's impressive vocal range (at times sounding like Hansi K&uuml;rsch of Blind Guardian) and riffs that belong with the likes of Metallica.  But the truly stand-alone tracks include \\"Melancholy (Holy Martyr)\\", \\"Blessed Are You\\" (which sounds a lot like \\"Melancholy\\"), \\"Watching Over Me\\" and the instrumental masterpiece \\"1776\\".<br /><br />Ironically, though, the best songs from these metal lords are often the softer ones.  Just as Disturbed has \\"Darkness\\", In Flames has \\"Metaphor\\" and Ill Ni&ntilde;o has \\"With You\\", Iced Earth has \\"Consequences\\".  The song opens with an acoustic riff similar to that of newer Queensryche, and slowly builds intensity.  Like the &uuml;ber-melodic \\"Watching Over Me\\", the song is a pleasure to listen, time and time again.<br /><br />The album is entertaining.  However, their musical style as a whole, at times, lacks in innovation.  Apart from the harmonizing guitars and infectious riffs, there is little variation from song to song (with the exception of \\"Consequences\\").  The songs are good, but on the 20th listen, they will still be good, and not great.<br /><br />They're definitely worth a listen and a chance.  The album, although wicked in tone, is not wicked in melody.he exception of \\"Consequences\\").  The songs are good, but on the 20th listen, they will still be good, and not great.

B00005JLT5|2.0|This film's story is potentially moving, but rendered rather boring by Adrien Brody's uncaring and mushy performance of its protagonist.  As the plot dragged on, I kept asking why I should care about the sufferings and torments of this man who didn't seem to care himself what happened to him.  No matter what happens, Brody's reaction is always a bland, disinterested smirk that becomes more and more irritating.  Too bad: the story deserved a better presentation.

B00005OAIE|5.0|&quot;You should listen to John Mayer&quot;, a friend said to me when I played Jack Johnson's &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot; for him.  I immediately dismissed him since the only song I heard at the time by Mayer was &quot;Your body is a wonderland&quot;.  Don't get me wrong, since then, I have come to love that song, but at the time (and without hearing any of his other stuff), I thought he was NSYNC with a guitar.  Now I'm at the point where I really feel I have to defend his songwritting ability.  I've read alot of reviews that he's like the Dave Mathews Band, or too teenyboppin', or too &quot;sensitive&quot;.  First off, I have to say I'm actually surprised that he has gotten so popular with the younger crowd being that he's a very mature songwritter and guitar player.  I will agree that the CD is a little over polished, but great just the same.  Now, maybe this is just cause I'm a leftie, bleeding heart ... etc... etc, but all I can say is if there's ever been an artist that I've been able to relate to, musically, and say &quot;wow, this guy is talking about how I feel&quot;.  This is the essence of John Mayer.  If you get nostalgic about past relationships, or like when the 10th time you hear a song you hear something different, you &quot;understand&quot; what he was trying to say.  That's what Mayer has done for me, and now Jack Johnson and John Mayer are basically all I listen to when I need to unwind, or am feeling down, or just plainly want to hear some great music.  If you're a redneck, or like metallica, or lyrics that have no meaning, then you probably won't like Mayer.  If however, you think you'd like to hear Life unravelled in the most poetic way, with great melody and genuinity, then this is the music for you.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|i dont have very many complaints about this album. the songs are all generally good with the exception to a select few, and the quality doesnt sound like todays music 9thank god) all yo upeople saying the quality sucks shjould burn in hell cause bands like Iron Maiden and metallica shouldnt sound like nickelback or three doors down...those bands suck. Anyway, back to the album. The best songs are Dance of death, wildest dreams, rainmaker, no mor elies, paschendale and journeyman which is a great finale unlike anything ive heard from a maiden album...good job guys! keep it up!
B000002OMN|5.0|Sixteen years after BAT OUT OF HELL, following a period of several years in the wilderness, Meat Loaf returns to the blend of Billy Joel, Ted Nugent, and Bruce Springsteen that served him so extravagantly well on the earlier album, this time with Jim Steinman writing AND producing, and the result is an incredibly over-the-top album that, surprisingly in a year of Nirvana and Pearl Jam, topped the charts and won a Grammy. If the first BAT captured adolescent exuberance, this CD is the work of an older man looking back at his teen years with both fondness and regret. This album is, for me, a treatise on why I've skipped food-related functions at my old school in favor of looking good for a number of attractive female celebrities, even though I don't want to totally lose touch with some of the staff who are still there.
B00005Y228|5.0|Even after a year and a half, I am still &quot;spinning around&quot; to Kylie Minogue's ingeneous dance-pop album, FEVER.  I absolutely had no idea who Minogue was prior to this release mainly because she wasn't marketed here in the U.S.  When &quot;Locomotion&quot; came out in the States back in the late 80s, I was only like 4 or 5, so I had no idea who Kylie  Minogue was.  Thanks to a friend of mine, he had mentioned to me in late 2001 about this song called &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot; by a singer called Kylie Minogue.  He convinced me to download it and I did, and, to my surprise, I loved it because it was totally different than any dance-pop song I have heard.  It had an extremely catchy chorus and sounded simple, yet hot.  So, when this album was released in early 2002, I decided to buy it because I loved the first single (CGYOOMH) a lot.  Boy, was I damn glad to have bought it.  Not only was this one of the best albums to come out in 2002, but it is one of the best dance-pop albums ever.  The arrangements, sounds, vocal textures and layering... it's infectious, dance-floor, nitty gritty, deep dance-pop at its best.  My favorite track from FEVER is, without a doubt, the 2nd single, &quot;Love At First Sight.&quot;  It was &quot;my&quot; song of summer '02, as this is one of the greatest dance-pop songs I have ever heard.  This should of been a #1 hit for sure.  Even though Madonna, Gloria Estefan, and Cher make some great dance albums, this album is just so different from all the others out there.  Minogue's voice is not too powerful, yet it is very playful and full of energy.  Since this release, I have become so infatuated with her career that I have explored her UK music and much to my surpise, it is great.  However, she is best at doing dance songs.  Her voice doesn't really suit ballads all that well.  The dance market is definitely her territory.  Also, the other aspect that I had no idea about was how huge she was internationally, but not inthe States.  She's UK and Australia's greatest-selling female artist.  She has had a great career thus far, from TV to music to films.  If you don't have a pure dance-pop album in your collection, this is the one to go with.  Great sounds, great vibes, great voice, great style.  Simple yet infectious!  If you're into Latin dance-pop, Gloria Estefan's 1998 album GLORIA! is a definite must.  Another great album.  I'm definitely looking forward to a lot more great tunes from Kylie in the near future.
6305648522|5.0|Surveys show that a majority of U.S.-raised filmgoers will rule out any movie that features subtitles.  They'd rather go for more subtle, sophisticated domestically-produced fare like 'Freddy Got Fingered' and 'Dude, Where's My Car?'.<br />That's a shame, because it's a big world out there and many of today's best cinematic experiences are coming from a diverse range of places like Spain, Argentina, Denmark and Iran.<br />Want to get that certain someone over their subtitle-phobia?  No better place to start than 'Cinema Paradiso.'  This Italian picture won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1988.  The movie itself depicts the power of cinema to change someone's life.  It transcends language.  It could only be in Italian, and seeing it in that language only adds to the pleasure of the viewing experience.  The subtitles are never a distraction.<br />The ending of the film is a stunner.  In fact, it's perhaps one of the most emotional and brilliantly conceived endings ever filmed.  I challenge any filmgoer to rent/buy 'Cinema Paradiso' and not be bowled over by it.

This is a no-hold's-barred album giving more insight into the behind the scenes of Linkin Park's members and their project: Meteora.

This album will definitely make you a die-hard fan of Linkin Park!!
0312319517|5.0|Frederick Forsyth said he was retiring from thriller writing after his last one. Thank God he changed his mind, since he tops himself here. I've read all his books, and the last ones have been slightly disappointing, but THE AVENGER is first rate. I'll probably read it twice. I think Forsyth may have been inspired by moral anger in the wake of 9/11 events, as he incorporates it in this book, and the result is a great book. It's probably the best thriller I've read since Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE: A NOVEL OF INTERNATIONAL SUSPENSE.

B000069HKH|5.0|I'm Australian and I LOVE THIS ALBUM. I have listened to it over and over and the song themes, based on the 9/11 tragedies, are thoughtfully delivered and written. &quot;You're Missing&quot; is sung from the perspective of a relative of a Spouse, Parent or Child that didn't come home that on horrible day. &quot;Into The Fire&quot; which speaks of those heroic Firemen that went up those stairs never to return is so touching and inspirational. &quot;Mary's Place&quot; is uplifting with it's optimistic viewpoint. These are but three wonderful moments on an album whose approach is an excercise in intelligence and sensitivity while at the same time addressing the feelings of all of us (even non-Americans)who were in some way touched whether physically, emotionally or psychologically by 9/11.  It's also a lot more relevant than the jingoistic, flag-waving reactions by Paul McCartney (&quot;Freedom&quot;) and Bon Jovi (&quot;Undivided&quot; from the &quot;Bounce&quot; album), well-meaning as they may have been...I do understand the sentiment (those songs are angry by comparison to anything on &quot;The Rising&quot; and were written very soon after the events of 9/11).    I could write more but so many other reviewers have probably covered the same ground. I thoroughly recommend this album, even if you're not a Springsteen fan but love thoughtful songwriting and performance. <BR>FOOTNOTE: I had the pleasure of watching Bruce &amp; Band in an outdoor concert here in Sydney last March. It was one of the most energetic and heartfelt performances I've ever witnessed from an an artist of his calibre and this despite no less than 4 POWER FAILURES IN THE 1ST 90 MINUTES. That he and the E Streeters performed for a total of 3 and a half hours is a testament to the professionalism of all concerned..a lesser artist would have &quot;spat his dummy (pacifier) out&quot; and walked off. Thanks Bruce &amp; Band.
0780020685|5.0|In 16th century Japan a poor village is raided each year by a group of bandits. One year, on the brink of starvation, the villagers decide to hire ronin (masterless samurai) to protect them. With only meagre payment of 3 meals a day, their quest seems an impossible one.<br />I`d heard so much from many friends about this being one of the greatest movies ever made - and in my opinion thats` not far wrong. Initially I was apprehensive, not because of the subtitles (I`m not a stranger to them, being a fan of foreign cinema) but because it was such a long film (over 3 hours), and I wasn`t sure about its` pacing for example since the basic plot of the film is a very simple one. Though I had seen a Kurosawa film before (Rashomon - 1950) many consider Seven Samurai to be his masterpiece, which I was a newcomer to.<br />I needn`t have worried about anything. Its` a very important film in World cinema - and its` got everything in it - drama, memorable characters, comedy, pathos, action and raw emotion. You really care about the characters in this film and what happens to them.<br />The climactic battle with the bandits and samurai, fought in splattering mud and pouring rain for example, is brilliantly done, and Kurosawa doesn`t flinch at showing us the violence and horror that occurs. The impact he had on cinema cannot be underestimated - many techniques, such as the use of slow motion to increase the impact of an action scene (which would later be implemented by HK maestros Chang Cheh and John Woo) were being seen on screen here for the very first time. It may be difficult to imagine how revolutionary that was for the audience.<br />The plot may be simplistic, but in the hands of a master film-maker, this really isn`t a problem as you`re always absorbed in these character`s lives.<br />Toshiro Mifune (who would appear in a lot of Kurosawa`s features) is excellent as Kikuchiyo, the farmers` son is also an aspiring samurai. He is a crazy and wild character.<br />The great scene in which he makes a blistering speech berating both the samurai for being evil and the farmers for being greedy is not without irony, first since he is clad in full samurai garb and second because the things he hits out at when accusing the samurai (killing people, raping women, stealing crops, burning houses) were being carried out a mere ten years before by the Japanese military in the Second World War. Also, up until that point in the film he had been nothing but a clown, which makes the turn all the more powerful.<br />Kurosawa also debunks the myth of the classic samurai hero, usually painted as fearless and invincible. In a scene where two samurai are talking one asks the other what he does in the face of danger. `I lie low in a ditch` he replies. `Then I run away`<br />Its` a mark of how good this film is that even today things are being drawn from it - most famously of course remade as the Western The Magnificent Seven (1960) by John Sturges, but even Disney have to thank him, as their 1998 computer animated comedy A Bug`s Life is based on Kurosawa`s film.<br />I`m ever so pleased I saw this - if you`re a fan of World cinema (heck, just cinema in general) you really must see it. Don`t be hesitant by its` long runtime, subtitles or its full frame ratio. Its` a marvellous film.<br />Trust me on this.<br />This DVD from the Criterion Collection features the rarely seen original US Theatrical Trailer for Seven Samurai, plus a full length commentary (something lacking in the BFI Region 2 release) by Japanese film expert Michael Jeck. I`ll admit I haven`t heard all of that yet, though what I`ve heard so far is very interesting!<br />This version is the fully restored cut of the film (206 minutes) which includes a short intermission and has been transferred from a new 35mm composite low contrast print. Considering the age of the film, I was impressed with how it looked, though certain shots looked really fuzzy and were like watching through mist (probably due tothe age/condition of the materials though).ondition of the materials though).
0060012358|5.0|I was beginning to feel that the Discworld books were getting a bit tired; the author himself has claimed he wanted to write something else. While set in Discworld, this book does not follow any of the established Discworld storylines. I would go so far as say his children's books (Bromeliad, Good Omens, etc.) are superior to anything Discworld. Even the names of the rats have kept me chuckling for several weeks.
0316666343|5.0|I was given this book as a gift but kept putting off reading it -I was afraid it would be too sad, a book about a girl who has been murdered and is in heaven looking down upon her prior world.  I picked it up one evening and was captivated from the start.  The premise is one I haven't seen before, and that is one thing that sets this book apart.  Ms. Sebold is a wonderful writer with a great gift for storytelling.

0385504209|5.0|I had trouble staying with this book at first, but when I got into it, I could not put it down.  I love the information presented about Leonardo Da Vinci - I now see him in a different light - and reading about the &quot;secret&quot; behind Mona Lisa's smile and some of his other religious paintings.  <br />This book presents some pretty startling answers to questions I have held for awhile about Christianity and the Catholic faith.  It helped open my mind to some things while making others more clear to me.  Although it is a work of fiction, there is much factual historical information contained in the book, which I found fascinating.<br />Absolutely one of the best books I've read in a very good while!

1559408898|5.0|Another fine edition to the Criterion Collection, director Paul Verhoeven's 1987 &quot;Robocop&quot; functions on many different levels, not only as a very entertaining science fiction movie, but also as a piece of social satire.  Verhoeven and screenwriters Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier surely had the ability to see into the future, as the world they envisioned has, in many ways, come true.<br />Old Detroit, the near future.  The city is terrorized by a gang of thugs, headed by Clarence Boddicer (&quot;That 70's Show&quot; Kurtwood Smith) and his men.  The city has decided to turn over the operation of the police department to the OCP corporation.<br />Enter cop Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), freshly transferred to the Old Detroit police department.  Partnered with Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen), Murphy and Lewis hit the streets.<br />An encounter with Boddicer and his boys leaves Murphy, well, dead.  Enter smarmy OCP executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), who has been developing a program to create a cyborg cop.  Murphy becomes his guinea pig and &quot;Robocop&quot; is born.<br />Much of the social satire and humor Verhoeven interjects into the movies comes in the form of in-movie television broadcasts, the sort of which are common now, on CNN, MSNBC and the like.  Smiling reporters dish out daily doses of sex and violence to the masses.<br />The story is essentially the robot Murphy's regaining of his humanity.  His creators erase his memory, or so they think, until Murphy begins to experience flashbacks from his former life, including memories of his death, which leads him on a search to avenge his death.  His search takes him back to OCP as he confronts the man who was responsible for his death.<br />As submitted to the MPAA, &quot;Robocop&quot; was going to be awarded with the dreaded &quot;X&quot; rating for violence.  The Criterion Collection release of &quot;Robocop&quot; restores Verhoeven's original vision, which is a few seconds here and there of blood and gore.  While the film is indeed violent, the bloodshed is certainly tame by today's standards -- Verhoeven's &quot;Starship Troopers,&quot; released in 1997, is much bloodier and violent than &quot;Robocop&quot; and it received an &quot;R&quot; rating.<br />The transfer, while non-anamorphic, is still very good; the film is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen.  There are two audio tracks, a Dolby Digital 2.0 track and commentary track.  The commentary is lifted from the laserdisc edition of &quot;Robocop,&quot; and is an entertaining discussion with Verhoeven, his writers, and others involved in the production.<br />Until &quot;Robocop&quot; gets the special edition DVD treatment, this Criterion version is worth hunting down.  &quot;I'd buy that for a dollar!&quot;e.

B00008IAMD|5.0|When I bought this CD today, I kept thinking, there'll probably be many more Cash tribute albums, re-releases, and unreleased recordings...but this is the last new Johnny Cash album we'll ever have.  <br />And what a tremendous album it is.  The title track is one of the most amazing songs Cash ever penned.  Cash writes in the liner notes that he spent more time writing this song than any other in his life.  It's a song that only a man near the end of his life can sing, a song that's revelatory, apocalyptic, biblical, and extremely powerful.  It grabs you and refuses to let go.  It will be a Cash classic forever.  Next, the Nine Inch Nails tune \\"Hurt\\" takes on a whole new meaning in Cash's hands.  It's an amazing performance.  Cash revisits \\"Give My Love to Rose,\\" a song he originally recorded 45 years ago.  The difference is 45 years ago, Cash was telling the story.  In this version, he's living the story.  The song hasn't changed, but the singer's perspective has, in a powerful way.<br />Cash the storyteller has never sounded better, whether it's covering Sting's \\"I Hung My Head\\" or the standard \\"Streets of Laredo.\\"  Tunes like \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\\" \\"In My Life,\\" and others carry a reflective, spiritual quality.  It's almost like Cash had already come to terms with his life and was preparing for leaving this world.  The closing \\"We'll Meet Again\\" is a fitting way for Johnny to say goodbye to his fans.  It's full of the hope and faith that he must have carried with him when he left us.  <br />And what can I say about the DVD except thank you, American Recordings, for including this treasure.  <BR> <BR>This is the last new Johnny Cash album we'll ever have.  Maybe it'll be enough.  No.  It'll never be enough.  The man is gone.  He can't be replaced.  But we were blessed to hear him for the short time he was with us.  Blessed in black.     <br />TOTAL TIME: 52:03
B00005JKEZ|5.0|The  Adventures of Robin Hood remains one of the best adventure stories ever put on film. In this new DVD, the viewer will see it in a better version than did the theatre goers of 1938.The transfer to disc has to be seen to be believed: there is a depth to the picture that is almost 3D like. The colors are crisp and vivid. The audio is monaural; there wasn't too much that could be done to change that. <br />Of course the movie remains an excellent telling of the Robin Hood legend with Kudos to all involved. I have not gotten to the second &quot;special features&quot; disc yet, but after watching the movie, which arrived today, I wanted to tell all just how great an experience this is.<br />No film collection should be without it.

I highly recommend this book to anyone trying to potty train their daughter.

B00003CXMG|5.0|I fell in love with Cameron Crowe after seeing this film. No one has ever put into words, song, and action the *precise* effect that music has had on my life, and I feel indebted toward him for expressing that love in ways that I can't. Which is why I swooned throughout the entire movie the very first time I saw it, falling in love with each of the characters (Penny Lane especially, for her motherly concern for the well being of others, her fragile facade of iron will while being so obviously soft, and her unbelievably real sweetness). Penny Lane is a falling leaf in this film, beautiful and fragile and adrift on the changing winds of other's emotions. Yet, behind this exquisite frailty lies a masked strength of character and an almost regretful understanding of &quot;when and where the real world occurs.&quot; <br />I found it only fitting, then, that the movie ended on my favorite song -- Zeppelin's underrated &quot;Rain Song.&quot; I feel this is perfectly appropriate for the scene, for its underappreciated beauty and time-capsule capture of that one fleeting sense of drifting away from innocence and daydreams, wanting to hold on, yet understanding and saying goodbye anyway... and trying to understand you were better for the experience. Now, when I hear this song, I envision the scene of the weary kiss blown from the fingers a tired fan as she watches the tour bus drive away into the morning, Penny Lane skirting the desolate and littered post-concert grounds with a rose and a smile, spinning on a napkin, and the innocent, unabashed brown love gaze of William Miller through the colored scarves of the band-aides.<br />I can watch this movie a million times and I would give it as many stars if I could. One of the best quotes: &quot;The only currency in this bankrupt world are the things we share with each other when we're uncool.&quot;<br />Superb movie. Perfect casting. Perfect soundtrack. Heart-wrenching cinemetography and acting. There's nothing else to say.
0783227019|5.0|You can't beat the combo of Brian De Palma and Al Pacino.  This film excels in every way and rivals Pacino's flawless performance in 'Scarface'.  Solid acting from all, imaginative photography and well written story come together to make this a winner.  Even Sean Penn (who has never been a favorite of mine) turns in a fine showing in this crime thriller.  The train station climax is one of the most gripping scenes of its type that I've ever seen.  No weaknesses in this gem that I could find.  No Pacino collection is complete without &quot;Carlito's Way&quot;.
B00009MGQL|3.0|I ordered this for someone else, but had to listen. I love the techno bass and rhythm that accompanies Beck's solid guitar solos. Very modern which makes me think that this will reach a wide variety of people. Very intense music, I imagine driving down the highway from the very start of &quot;So what&quot;. So fasten your seatbelts and hang on!!!
B00007BKVC|5.0|By far, her best film.  Well written, tense and well photographed, Thelma &amp; Louise is always near the top of my favorite films.  The story might be a bit unbelievable, but you get past that quickly as we watch two middle class housewives set out on a weekend vacation that soon becomes a nightmare.  Solid performances all around and an engrossing music score by Hans Zimmer give this one maximum 'stars'.
0783225547|5.0|To put it short and sweet, Dante's Peak is a pretty darn good movie about Volcanic activity.  Sure it fudges the laws of physics a little here and there, but the special effects are phenomenal for the movie, nothing compares.  Volcano, staring Tommy Lee Jones, also debuted the same year, but it really doesn't compare.<br />Being a Geographer, and working toward Volcanology myself, this movie uses good terminology and for the most part is pretty realistic on what really happens in a Volcanic explosion, at least of Composite Volcanoes.<br />I give the movie 5 stars... the acting is excellent, the special effects great, and overall keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00007J5VN|2.0|Ok, this movie is a clunker. The story doesn't hold up well in today's feminist or post-feminist era and MacLaine's performance made me cringe. <br />However, here's the great thing about DVD: use the scene selector to skip right to the fabulous dance numbers! &quot;Rich Man's Frug&quot; and &quot;Hey Big Spender&quot; are two of Fosse's best on film, and big enough that you'll want to watch them several times to catch all the details and dancers. And as a special treat to Fosse fans, the extras on the DVD include some brief segments with THE MAN himself. <br />Fosse newbies, skip right over this and go straight to CABARET which is a brilliant musical AND a brilliant film.
B00005JLWN|2.0|You've got to give this movie credit-- it does the best it can with a low budget.  The special effects run hot and cold (the cityscape is amazing, but the darkly-lit interiors practically scream &quot;No Budget&quot;); the performances are fine; and the direction more than competent.  Unfortunately, the screenplay needed work-- a lot of work.  What can you say about a movie where violence has supposedly been eliminated, but everyone is packin', and there's a gun battle about every fifteen minutes?  And why eliminate *all* art?  I can understand destroying rap CDs or slasher movies, but the Mona Lisa???  Seems kind of counter-productive to me.  The gun battles were the most interesting part of this too-bleak movie, but even that reached the height of silliness when Bale-- with his two pistols-- wipes out some fifty gunmen with automatic weapons (who, incidentally, are all lined up like ducks in a row).<br />The director's commentary is interesting mainly in recounting the numerous problems he had in filming this movie.
B0000399WI|5.0|In between all the mindless slush that we watch in mainstream america. You must Watch something of substance to tease your intellect and lifts the spirit.  and the shawshank redemption does exactly that. even though the dvd was shoddy the movie overpowers it. This is the best Non-Oscar film ive seen and Its a crime  that this film didn't get one. No special Effects. Just good Acting! this is the paul newman of films! A chilling tale of a framed Banker going to a maximum security prison for the murder of his wife and her &quot;concubine&quot; I reccomend this to anyone witha supreme intellect and a keen spirit. Cause we are All Andy, Being shackled in the maximum security prison of life maybe one day we will all escape.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The amount of musicality and lyricism in this CD was enough to blow me away.  And please, just because Maynard's name is on it does not mean I automatically graded it highly.  Like Tool, A Perfect Circle explores the darker side of the human psyche and integrates it with beauty, showing that pessimism is not necessarily terrible but a means to express honesty and purge superficiality.  The music on the CD is very ethereal and unearthly and is more of an experience rather than a collection of songs.  But unlike Tool's works, which exhibited volume and intensity, power is a subtle issue, which I personally found very effective; rather than being the subject of the song, it is integrated and underlain throughout the songs and, at the climatic, dramatic moments, after holding the audience back for so long, the expressionism and drama bursts out.  <BR>Basically, it's like what Alice in Chains did to Jar of Flies; APC is like the &quot;soft&quot; album of Tool, but it is still nonetheless equally as powerful.
0446608955|5.0|&quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; tells a story of a 40 year old man looking back on his senior year of high school as well as his first true LOVE!  Nicholas Sparks plays with your emotions and makes you want to keep on reading.  There were many moments in the book where I didn't want to put the book down.  I wanted to keep on reading until I found out what was going to happen next.  This was somewhat of a simple book, but Nicholas Sparks has an interesting way of writing.  I don't really like reading, but I enjoyed reading this novel.  It took me into another world.  A world that was much different from mine and a world that I could definitely learn from.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|I've been a Tull fan for a long time, through thick (as a brick) and thin (the &quot;techno&quot; years). This is a wonderful collection of intelligent new songs and re-arrangments of some old favorites.<br />Ian and the boys (old and new) have always had a flair for mixing the medieval sound with jazz and great rock. As Ian Anderson's liner notes suggest, &quot;If you liked Bouree and Songs from the Wood, you will love this...&quot;; I wholeheartedly agree.<br /> The re-recordings of classic songs like &quot;A Christmas Song&quot;, &quot;Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow&quot;, &quot;Fire at Midnight&quot;, &quot;Ring Out Solstice Bells&quot;, and the others are excellent and refreshing arrangements. The new songs, especially the jazz versions of &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot; and &quot;Greensleeved&quot;, and the complex and delightful &quot;Pavane&quot; hearken back to the peak (meaning concerts in 10000+ venues, not the quality of the music) of JT's career with us boomers. &quot;We Five Kings&quot; is the clever result of the traditional carol mated with &quot;Living in the Past&quot; (meaning it's in 5/4). What a treat!<br />This is an excellent holiday-themed album for those with more sophisticated and refined tastes in rock music. If you wonder whatever happened to Steeleye Span, Renaissance, and Fairport Convention (Dave Pegg is still around!), take heart, the spirit is still alive in Jethro Tull, even after all these years. But if you're one of the few Americans who wonder whatever happened to Mike Oldfield, you'll have to ask his record company.
B0000029DD|5.0|This is, simply put, THE most amazing piece of work ever done by any musician. Jeff Buckley combines that famous, soaring falsetto with the creative genious of a man that nobody could touch and creates a masterpiece. &quot;Hallelujah&quot; alone would constitute quite possibly one of the top albums ever made, no joke. In a word, unbelievable.
B000002BYD|5.0|The more I listen to this album, the more I love it.  I'd gotten caught up just listening to PJ live stuff, but I got back to some of the studio albums and fell in love with this all over again.  Pilate and Push Me Pull Me used to both get on my nerves, but after really listening to what's going on in those songs, I've come to appreciate them as well.<br />I like listening to CD's in the car.  And when a good song comes on, I'll turn it up.  And turn it back down a little when a not-so-good song comes on.  It's hard to listen to Yield in the car b/c I just want to turn it up for every new song.<br />Absolutely an amazing album and, in my opinion, Pearl Jam's finest. (With Riot Act coming in a close second)  If you don't have it, you've got to get it... then watch Single Video Theory.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Upon watching UNDERWORLD for the first time, I wasn't expecting to be very interested. I had read so many negative reviews and heard so many people say that it was a rip-off of ROMEO AND JULIET, that I just wasn't expecting much. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when the final credits started to roll and I was left sitting in my seat thinking, &#34;What? It's over already?&#34;<br /><br />As many have already stated, the film is about a vampire death-slayer (vampires who hunt wearwolves) who falls in love with a human who has been bitten by her most hated enemy, the werewolf overlord who was supposed to have been killed centuries before. The film starts off somewhat slow then rushes into a fighting frenzy, then slows down, then rushes into a fighting frenzy, then slows down. The entire movie is paced this way. Some find it irritating. However, I felt that it added to the mood of the movie, the pace of the film accompanying the transformations that the characters undergo both physically and psychologically.<br /><br />The lighting and costumes seemed to fit the dark underworld that is the setting for most of the film. The only time the tones lightened up were in flashbacks to centuries before when the wearwolves and vampires weren't at war, suggesting a more pleasant era.<br /><br />The characters in the movie aren't allowed to develop much, except through narrative. However, I didn't find that this took anything away from the movie.<br /><br />Much like all franchises (as UNDERWORLD is sure to become), this film sets up everything that is to come in the next. This isn't a thinking person's movie nor is it a full blown action piece; in the style and tone the movie has more of a literary feel than anything else. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough conflict between the wearwolves and the vampires; so much time is spent on setting the tone, mood, and narrative that there wasn't much time left for action. Nevertheless, I still found that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and look forward to seeing it again.ed the movie and look forward to seeing it again.
0553573403|4.0|This is one of the best books that I've read in the sci-fi/fantasy genre in a long time.  The book is a fairly large text - which readers of the genre should be used to. Martin is a very good writer and his style is accessible. With each chapter taken from a certain character's point of view, the entire story unfolds its many subplots with perfection.<br />This book is much better than Robert Jordan's series. The characters in Martin's book are extremely well-developed and it is impossible to select a favorite character - each has their own heroic and sinister attributes. This book (series) is also much more &quot;adult&quot; than the Dragonlance/Forgotten Realms series, so those who grew bored with those book will find something new in Martin.  If I had to rank the series, I'd say somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Brooks' 'Shannara' series - which means this is quite excellent.<br />A feature that I enjoyed was although there are elements of magic/other-world, the book is not overwrought with them. i.e. the characters are not running around casting spells and flying dragons everywhere. I would recommend this book with no reservation.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|This movie fails on every level. It lacks the story, action, and effects that made the first one such a classic. It pays to wait till the second weekend to see movies!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|When Stravinsky premiered a new piece of music in 1913, critics and the general public were all over themselves with disgust at the perceived bombast. That was the original performance of <BR>Le Sacre du Printemps (the Right Of Spring), now considered to be one of the greatest pieces of music ever written.<br />A friend asked why I love Rufus Wainwright's &quot;Want (One)&quot; so much and I couldn't give an answer. They asked what kind of music it is, and I still had no answer. I said &quot;It's all kinds of music at the same time&quot;. I guess that should be expected when the producer is the legendary Marius DeVries (Bjork, Massive Attack, Annie Lennox, Madonna). <br />You will not believe the things that are done with sounds on this cd. Some folks gawk at it being &quot;too overproduced&quot;, but there is so many good songs with absolutely stunning arrangements you may not believe your ears. I heard some of the widest dynamic ranges on record. <BR>Rufus's voice is it's own glorius instrument, which he uses to it's fullest potential here on every song. It may be an acquired taste, but it's definitely worth acquiring. His talented piano playing is, as always, wise beyond his years. Even the lyrics, which for so many seem hard to audibly decipher, are as stirring and courageous as ever. I see them as more self revealing than self indulgent. I hope you will too. <BR>No matter how strong, Rufus takes me down with one little song.<br />To the folks who think this is a musical &quot;quagmire&quot; or &quot;Miss Wainwright's&quot; &quot;Fairy Floss&quot;, I say Yeah, sure!<BR>And Mozart's Symphonies have too many notes!
B00008WJBU|5.0|My one complaint, which I'll state at the very start, is that the English subtitles remain even when the characters are speaking in English. It's very annoying. English subtitles when they're speaking Spanish (which is most of the film) makes sense... English subtitles when they're speaking English is just plain distracting.<br />Having gotten that out of the way...<br />I don't want to reveal too much of the story because half the fun is watching things gradually unfold, but I will say that this film has a very original premise, having to do with the nature of luck. The idea is that luck is an actual &quot;thing&quot; that can be traded, stolen, and gambled away.<br />Our central character is a thief who, it turns out, has the gift of luck and so is pulled into this strange world of people who collect luck. Many of these people are quite ruthless, and as the stakes gradually increase, our protagonist stands to lose far more than his knack for good luck.<br />The tone of this film is very creepy and clever... in many ways, it reminded me of &quot;Blood Simple,&quot; &quot;Memento,&quot; &quot;Music of Chance,&quot; or Atom Egoyan's &quot;Exotica.&quot; Like all four of those movies, there's a lot to absorb and it's handed to you in small pieces. This is a movie that requires your full concentration. Fortunately, that's not hard to give, as the film itself is absolutely fascinating and full of brilliant images and moments.<br />Eerie, beautiful, and not quite like anything else...
B000069AUI|5.0|i loved it.  i didn't expect to like it, but i do!!!!  I especially love Amsterdam, most of it focuses on the piano, but the lyrics are just amazing!
0385504209|4.0|good book, at times unbelievable but definite page turner.  recommend this book for 2 reasons: 1) pretty good orginal fiction thriller (based on the nonfiction bestseller holy blood holy grail) that will keep your attention until the end.  2) makes you think to keep an open mind for EVERYTHING especially any religion and appraoch whatever you read or learn with suspicion.<br />guess they are going to make a movie out of this now with ron howard on board.
B000092ZYX|4.0|I have to say that I really didn't like this album the first time I listened to it. I am a big Evanescence/Cranberries/Coldplay fan, but this album sounded a bit too weird to me in the beginning. Well, I am glad to say now that I was completely wrong. The music grew on me after the third listen. The layers of beats, drums, electronics, guitar (boy, there's plenty of it here) and piano (I really like A Punchup at a Wedding) makes the album rich with musical content that is bound to satisfy pop and rock fans.<br />Not all the tracks appealed to me, but I love those that did. Major standouts, in my opinion, are: 2 + 2 = 5 * Sit Down, Stand Up * There. There. * I Will * A Punchup at a Wedding (my favorite track) * Myxomatosis * A Wolf at the Door. Different tracks will appeal to different people. It all depends on what genre of music you like most. The tracks I listed above have a hint of pop in them. They are very listenable.<br />I liked this album so much I went and got Kid A and OK Computer. I haven't got to listen to them in their entirety yet but so far I like what I am hearing. They are exactly what I imagined rock would be in the future: more popish and very progressive. I definitely do like Radiohead's style.<br />My only complaint, though, is that I couldn't really make out most of what Thom Yorke was saying. He really does need to enunciate! The lyrics of this album are very symbolic and do actually add great weight to the music. It's a shame that we cannot clearly hear the words.<br />For a first-time listener, I am very satisfied. If you are contemplating buying this album, I assure you that you won't be disappointed. Just be patient and listen to it several times before making up your mind about it. From my experience, it's those albums that take a while to appreciate that stay in your memory forever.
B00009APK1|5.0|I have not read the book, so I won't be comparing to it in this review. We did see this movie in movie theater and it is 100X better than watching it at home. I still can't get over all the special effects in this and the first movie. The landscapes are as beatiful and as creepy as human mind would imagine. Everyone
B000089RVX|4.0|I was at Virgin Records when I looked at this album and thought to myself, \\"cool cover, I wonder how the music sounds.\\" When I listened to the first song (Going Under), I grabbed a copy of the CD and was on my way home to listen to it in its entirety in the comfort of my living room. It had this kind of impact on me!<br />This is a refreshing album that sets that standard for the Alternative Rock/Progressive Rock sounds. Amy Lee's vocals are mesmerizing (notable in Going Under, My Immortal and My Imaginary). You can easily tell that this band has incredible potential of being the next Cranberries (Requiem for The Cranberries?)<br />The band seems to be influenced by the style of The Cranberries (Going Under, Tourniquet, My Imaginary, Everybody's Fool), Sarah McLachlan (My Immortal, Hello), Tori Amos (Haunted), Linkin Park (Taking Over Me, Bring me to Life, Whisper.) So if you like any or all of these artists, you will definitely like Evanescence.<br />My favorite tracks are Going Under, My Imaginary, My Immortal and Taking Over Me. This is definitely a haunting record reminiscent of Tori Amos' From The Choirgirl Hotel. If you are reading this review, this means you have some interest in this album. I have three words for you: get it now!
B00000JHAU|5.0|Alright, not in motion as a cd is a static object but hey who's counting? This album contains some of my favourite songs of all time. This band practice songwriting like a craft and they are quite the craftsmen! Lyrically amazing the songs strike the balance between being softly spoken and understated while saying things that make you shudder. I've never heard such a gift for lyrical structure and storytelling in a songwriter. Seeing other people is such a wonderful chronicle of the games played in relationships, stars of track and field a heartfelt cry of jealousy and feelings of inadequacy. Lines float out on top of melodies and you wonder how anyone ever managed to fit them so seamlessly into a song? 'She was into s&amp;m and vital studies not everyone's cup of tea'. An album full of beautiful truth pasted over beautiful melodies.
0385504209|2.0|Brown relies on the theories presented in the book Holy Blood Holy Grail, a work of of very shoddy scholarship.  It makes huge leaps in logic and ignores many of it's cited sources.  The Gnostic Gospel of Thomas actually presents Jesus as a male chauvist not someone who repsects the &quot;sacred feminine.&quot;  In it he says women will only enter heaven when they &quot;become like men.&quot;  It is interesting to note that the UC at Berkely (not exactly a pro-Christian institution) has a course on recognizing bad logic, and Holy Blood (Brown's basis for this novel)is required reading.  Check out the university website and see for yourself.  There are also many mistakes related to Leonardo and his works; a big one being the portrayal in the novel of the Madonna of the Rocks being on canvas (it was painted on wood).  None of this would matter if Brown had not claimed to have researched his facts in order to write this story.
B00005IC2H|1.0|I'm sorry.<br />Did I rate it 1 star? I meant 5.<br />Curious to see on what grounds something so directly and obviously beautiful as this CD could be disliked, I scanned all the negative reviews here to date. Aside from the one respectable negative reviewer--from Iceland--who simply and honestly declared that he &quot;just doesn't get it,&quot; I noticed a rather amusing pattern. Intriguingly, there is the nearly universal employment of the word &quot;pretentious&quot; somewhere in the review. This is coupled with the nearly universal pretentiousness of the negative reviews (endless namedropping, amateurish &quot;rock-reviewer&quot; posing, and even some music &quot;biz&quot; kibbitzing, as if they were addressing a stockholder's meeting). The earliest negative review is the paradigm: Devon Reed manages to use the adjective &quot;pretentious&quot;--without irony--in a review that not only contains a quote from Pauline Kael, but attempts to coin the idiotic word &quot;overwhelmingness.&quot; I can think of few more pretentious exercises than to dress up one's gut dislike for a work of art with bloated prose about &quot;influences&quot; and solemn pronouncements on the state of contemporary music.<br />The verdict seems clear: if you are a pretentious--that's right, pretentious--would-be rock critic who has spent years cultivating a refined musical dyspepsia as a replacement for ears, and whose tastes serve as a pseudointellectual identity badge entitling you to whine about people who find beauty where you don't, then stay away from Sigur Ros. You know who you are, and you paradoxically risk a dangerous blood-pressure spike whenever you listen to anything deliberately tranquil. However, if you are just about any other stripe of human, there's a good chance you'll be pleasantly hypnotized by this simply beautiful CD.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I was at first hesistant to see this movie, due to the fact that up to the point of actually watching it, I had heard hundreds of comments laced with gore and disgust about some of the content of this French production.  And, truth be told, they were not exaggerated. <br />However, there's a reedeming quality to this film which in one word can be stated as: art.  In a visual aspect, in the way the story line unfolds, in the acting, in the director's beautiful play with color, even in the accompanying soundtrack (which I also bought), the French-film flair for challenging its viewers while retaining a certain 'je ne sais quoi' is beautifull carried through.<br />This is a film not only for art-house cinema lovers but anyone willing to explore new forms of storytelling and visual play.  On the other hand, it's not relevent to a viewer who defines cinema by Hollywood standards.
0385504209|3.0|For the most part, I enjoyed this book; and you can read many other helpful reviews that supply more detail about this book than I will in this review.  The main purpose for my review is to point out what I consider to be Brown's almost \\"hate-literature\\"-like portrayal of a person with albinism.  In his character Silas, the Opus Dei monk who is also an assassin, Brown perpetuates a long-standing literary stereotype of albinism as associated with evil. (Please look up Luna Eterna's Albinism in Literature web page.)<br />  Brown describes this character with a visually demoniac appearance, endowing him with the rarer red-eyed form of albinism.  Real people with this form of albinism do not, in fact, look demonic at all.  (Please see the work of photographer Rick Guidotti and his Positive Exposure project which originally ran in Life Magazine a few years ago and has now grown into a movement to encourage the acceptance of difference.  You can find out more on the web,)<br />  Brown also seems not to have done his homework: people with albinism connot see well enough to shoot a gun accurately and the vast majority cannot drive a car.  This is because, as a direct result of the pigment disorder, there is not enough pigment in the retinas of the eyes; therefore people with albinism have severely limited eyesight that cannot be corrected.  I found I had a very hard time suspending my disbelief when, for example, at the beginning of the book in the Louvre, Silas was able to shoot the museum's curator at a distance of 15 feet and hit his target with pinpoint accuracy.<br />  So, I give this book only 3 stars because of the way Brown mistreated the archetype of albinism and because I feel that since he took so much care to research art history, the history of secret societies and of religion and symbolism, he really ought to have researched albinism as well.<br />  I hope that when they make the film adaptation of this book that they will rewrite Silas' character entirely, and rely on some other back-story device, rather than albinism, to explain his violent madness.acter entirely, and rely on some other back-story device, rather than albinism, to explain his violent madness.
B00000273M|5.0|In the eighties, when pop music (at least in Britain) was dominated by synthesisers, the Bangles provided a contrast with their guitar-driven rock music. They were not alone, of course - Dire Straits and Bruce Springsteen also come to mind - but they were very much in the minority. The Bangles recorded a lot of upbeat, fun songs so did not always get the credit they deserved.<br />This compilation contains the three huge international hits that everybody remembers. Manic Monday is an up-tempo rocker. Walk like an Egyptian is a novelty song that (to some people) destroys their credibility but I love it. Eternal flame is a lovely ballad, more recently revived by Atomic Kitten who had a huge UK hit with it.<br />Apart from those three, they had several other hits, not as successful as the famous three but very entertaining. These include the original songs If she knew what she wants, Walking down your street, In your room and Be with you, together with a cover of Simon and Garfunkel's Hazy shade of winter.<br />Anybody who loves guitar rock of the type that was common in the sixties and early seventies will surely love the music of the Bangles. If you want just one of their albums, this is the one to go for.
B000089RVR|4.0|I think I might be one of the few that have NOT enjoyed NO ANGEL and prefer this album more.  I never bought NO ANGEL because there wasn't enough in it worth buying.  However, I alwyas give artists another chance and downloaded this first.  To my surprise, this grew on me so fast and I had to buy it on the day it came out.  9 out of 11 tracks ain't a bad number and they are phenominal.  My definate favs are WHITE FLAG, STONED, LIFE FOR RENT, SEE YOU WHEN YOU ARE 40, SEE THE SUN, and DON'T LEAVE HOME.  I'm not sure what it is about DIDO but her voice is beautiful and her lyrics are cool.  The music is soothing and very different from I am used to hearing.  The only reason why this doesn't deserve 5 stars is because to me, it ISN'T the perfect album but a very good one and well worth the money!
B000089RVR|4.0|Missing the lushness of No Angel in some ways. Many songs are bare and remind me of B-sides that are good, but missing an intensity. Mary's In India bothers me in this way. The pitter-patter drum electronic beat is annoying to me on this track. I do not care for See You When You're 40. My favorite tracks are: White Flag, Don't Leave Home, Who Makes You Feel, Sand In My Shoes, Do You Have A Little Time, &amp; See The Sun. Don't expect another No Angel. This is different, more mellow, intelligently written, somewhat predictable if you know No Angel well, and unfortunately less goosebump inducing. Dido's voice is less exciting this time around.

B000092ZYX|3.0|I am waiting for the great Radiohead experiment to end.  Personally, I thought Kid A, with the exception of a couple songs, was terrible.  Amnesiac was even worse. Hail to the thief, while somewhat better, is a long way from their earlier work.  Thom, put down the bong, pick up the guitars, and play.  <br />Also, I want to concur with sentiments other reviewers have made:  Just becuase it's radiohead, does not make it good.  Sure, Rolling Stone and every other critic loves them, but as a fan, and a music lover, I am still waiting for them to return to the glory days.
6305897786|3.0|I wasn't going to write anything (I'm researching, just read an online version of the movie script, with a few things that changed by the time it got to film), but I was dumbstruck by so many people griping they were never explained who the mysterious &quot;girl&quot; was.<br />So the clue in the Baroness' handwritten notes in her copy of the book wasn't enough for you?<br />`I will recognize your servants, my brethren, by the sign that adorns some part of their body, a scar or mark of your making...' <br />Geez, guys, is it too much of a stretch of the imagination to see that girl (and the jarring colour of her eyes) as a demon sent by the devil to assure that the people trying to become immortal (or &quot;summon him&quot;, selon the person in question) don't succeed? And somewhere in the proceedings, she decides (or the devil has already decided) that Corso would open the Ninth Gate to obtain immortality? Pity he doesn't have more of a personality to entertain throughout the ages... although he'll have more than enough time to develop one.<br />I won't say I enjoyed the movie when I saw it (I was too upset, especially considering the person with whom I was watching it, in retrospect... funny we're talking about the devil), but I have to say that, the more I'm digging through this, the more I'm fascinated.
0676973779|5.0|I bought this book after reading about it in a online paper. Since I used to live in California, and now moved to Canada, I still enjoy reading the paper. I saw it as the Star-gazing book pick of the month. I highly recommend this book.
B00005JLTN|5.0|I still can't figure out why people have labelled this flick as AWFUL.It's far from it,far from boring.It's a real improvement over the first one.Great battles,action scenes,effects,music,photography to name a few.I've watched the first installment(which is a must) 6 or 7 times - I do have the DVD loaded with extras - still some effects are aging,for instance,in the beginning Trinity is being hunted by the agents and leaps from the top of a building - at some point you can make out it's fake.Anyway it's a great movie- a classic in all aspects.This second part never shows you anything like that.Every effect is carefully produced.People complain about the Zion part,the \\"rave\\" ,the \\"Sodom & Gomorrah\\" scenes - but they forget the K Bros were trying to show us what it is like to live in a hellish place - living under threat with very few reasons to feel it's great to be alive.I didn't enjoy these passages,but I didn't frown on them.As to the \\"confusing inconsistent\\" plot,people forget this is SCI-FI = FANTASY - thus things can be interpreted differently - it's like reading a book - the last part will certainly put everything together.As for not revolutionalizing anything,showing nothing new seems to be an understatement because,like T3 it displays an array of wonderful effects,flawless choreography,great design and wardrobe.It may not be perfect but gets close.It is good as part one - if not better.<BR>Written by the owner of the best 600 VHS/ 400 DVD action sci-fi horror movies of all times .
0385504209|5.0|What really stands out about this book is how believable much of it can be. There's enough basis in fact to make me look up much of what is mentioned within its pages, and often leaving me pleasantly surprised as I search. An incredible twist ending brings the story full circle, and leaves me wanting more.This is a book that everyone should have in their collection.Another book that I highly recommend is &quot;HE NEVER CALLED AGAIN.&quot;
B0000AUHPG|5.0|There seems to be a misconception that the U.S. (region 1) release will be in 1.77:1. This is simply not true.<br />From dvdbreakdown (the first English-language DVD site to post a full review of this release):<br />This long-awaited title is finally to be released as a two-disc collector's set by Paramount, first in early October 2003 for Region 2, and then on November 18, 2003 for Region 1. The only notable difference between the two versions is the absence of the original mono soundtrack on the Region 2 release, which contains only the Dolby Digital 5.1 remix. The Region 2 release served as the basis for this review.<br />The anamorphic widescreen image is framed at an aspect ratio of approx. 2.35:1. For this impatiently awaited DVD release, Paramount has clearly taken every effort to restore Leone's masterpiece, and the result is nothing short of breathtaking. The Techniscope process that was used for this film is notorious for its faded colors and lack of detail in blurred, aging prints. But this new transfer not only boasts rich, vibrant colors, terrific sharpness and impressive detail, it is also absolutely spotless, without a single spot, scratch or blip in the image throughout its extended running time. Astonishingly, film grain is hardly ever visible at all, and blacks are deep, with excellent contrast.<br />Hope this clears things up.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This is a movie that, to me, succeeds on every level...as entertainment, as cinema, a drama, as an astounding technical achievement.  At risk of losing my geek cred, I have never read the Lord of the Rings books (I may yet, though), but the films in this series have just blown me away.  I am especially impressed by Gollum, even though he bears a startling resemblence to someone I know.  <BR>And as for the &quot;Tolkien Purists&quot;...please be mindful of the different challenges that the film medium imposes.  Try to appreciate Peter Jackson's staggering achievement for the labor of love it is.  The Lord of the Rings is not history, it's a series of novels (i.e., the comment one reviewer made about Aragorn and &quot;a battle he wasn't even in&quot;).<BR>Just enjoy.
B000006045|2.0|What is up with all the glowing reviews people are giving this disc?  `mezzanine' marked the end of my love affair for massive attack and I've never looked back.  I'm not even remotely curious about their latest release 100th window.  From what I've heard it's not even the full line up anymore.<br />`angel' is a grating, irritating and annoying track.  Just because it's been used in countless films and commercials does not make it amazing.  I'm just not \\"getting\\" the attraction to that song. The only tracks that make this disc worthwhile are the beautiful collaborations with liz fraser of cocteau twins.  Liz's voice is beautifully complimented by slow, dark crackling beats on `teardrop', `black milk' and the first half of `group four'.  Unfortunately the second half of `group four' falls back into the annoying elements that made `angel' such an awful track. I wish someone would do trip-hop remixes of cocteau twin songs or liz would come out with her own disc of triphop dreaminess.  She could be the reigning queen of triphop and put this sub par disc to shame.  The only other worthwhile track is the oppressive darkness of `man next door'.  Horace Andy's depressing vocals, the dark mood of the track and the sample of the cure's `10:15 On A Saturday Night' make this another track to check out.<br />Outside of that `mezzanine' is pure unfocused garbage.  If you haven't already, checkout `protection'.  The title track alone is goose bump inducing.  Who can resist Tracy Thorn's voice? Throw in Tricky, Nicolette and Horace you have a masterpiece.  `mezzanine' is far from that.
1400049628|4.0|There are some jokes that just get funnier the longer you draw them out, and this book is a perfect example of this. It's not  the kind of book you sit down and read in one sitting. It's better to just carry it around to consult when you need a laugh - or when the zombies are after you.
B0000931QR|5.0|This is probably the best of LODVG's albums.  Amaia's voice sounds beautiful, the choruses are great, lyrics are oustanding... BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL album.  I cannot believe how many times I listen to this CD a day without tiring of it! :)<br />I HIGHLY recommend it.
B000084T18|1.0|This goes out to the reviewer who asked why people who hate rap bother to review rap CDs.  The reason is that we're concerned for the integrity of the music industry; we look for quality in music, and seeing garbage like this forced down everyone's throat is not only annoying, but an outright mockery of true talent.  Where is the talent in this?  Do you even know what \\"talent\\" means?  He just talks over a programmed beat!  Half the time, he's stealing other musicians' music anyway.  I have to question the ethics of musicians (it's probably actually in the hands of the record companies) who allow their music to be slaughtered by giving samples of it to these rapper chimpanzees.  Then, you have reviewers like the ones on this site praising 50 Cent for his brilliant talent (which he does NOT have a bit of) and the fact that he's a gangster (yeah right) and that he's been shot.  Well, whoever shot him didn't aim high enough.<br />Do you think it's cool to listen to rap and hip-hop?  Do you think blasting this bass-laden adaptation of nursery rhymes out of your car makes you big and tough?  Do you think the \\"pimp\\" and \\"gangster\\" dress styles make you look cool?  Well, the rest of the world is laughing their rear ends off at Americans' poor taste in music.  Rap doesn't sell big anywhere but in the USA, and that's because they value talent in other countries.  Rap requires none.  Anyone can talk over a beat.  It's not poetic; poetry forces one to open one's mind and use one's imagination.  \\"Fiddy\\", as this obnoxious rambling buffoon has braggardly anointed himself, couldn't put together a coherent sentence if you held a knife to his crotch.  Just look at the language he uses.  Come to think of it, look at his fan base - LOOK AT YOURSELVES!  One idiot praised him for being a gangster, and stated boldly that this was what the mainstream needs.  Well, sir, what you need is to be executed by slow and painful torture for your blatant ignorance.  Then, you have white boys tryingto act \\"down wit da ghetto\\" and wearing baggy pants and showing their underwear because they think the girls think it's sexy.  The girls are just as stupid, as they're generally promiscuous and materialistic.  That's the hip-hop culture for you - be proud, America, we've taught our children to act like monkeys!  And the worst part is reading the language in these reviews:<br />\\"G-G-G-G-UUUNNIIITT!!!\\"<BR>\\"Yo fiddy be da shizzle fo rizzle\\"<BR>\\"get dis herre dis be off da chainz\\"<BR>\\"if u ain't down wid dis u ain't ill yo\\"<br />True, sir, I'm not \\"ill\\" (sorry dude, to me \\"ill\\" means \\"sick\\", not \\"cool\\", but hey what do I know, I'm just an educated, law-abiding citizen).  I know how to speak proper English, and I know how to spell.  I used to be a rap apologist myself, until being introduced to legitimate forms of music.  But in America, brilliant artists are left in the dust, and I was forced to find great talented artists on my own.  But who needs talent anyway?  No rapper, pop singer, or R&B singer possesses any, and they're the ones making it big.  Also, what's the deal with all the \\"dissing\\"?  These are supposed to be professional musicians (HA!), so instead of this infantile name-calling, they should be presenting themselves as more respectable individuals.  But no, we have to be macho!<br />So for you ignorant hip-hoppers that think us \\"haterz don't know what we be sayin and we just be dissin on yo dog,\\" remember these fundamental issues: 1) Rap advocates racism; by the excessive use of the \\"N-word\\", rappers have totally destroyed and defecated upon all that the great civil rights leaders fought so hard to make, 2) Rap takes NO talent; no rapper, I don't care if it's 50 Cent, Eminem, Canibus, Talib Kweli, Common, or whatever mutt you can throw at me - talking over beats does not, I repeat DOES NOT, take any skills; my 5-year-old cousins could produce better music, and 3) Rap is derogatory to all who listen to it, just look at the demographics of rap's fan base, and you're not going to find any respectable people, ESPECIALLY blacks.  I really feel bad for the hard-working blacks who absolutely despise this trashy noise that you morons call \\"rap\\", as the ignorant racists that still do exist use that stain against them and it's not even their fault.  So don't tell me you don't want to hear about rap from someone who doesn't like rap.  If it were legitimate music, that would be different.  But this is not music.  This is wastebasket material and the American mainstream should be ashamed of itself for forcing this unintuitive slop upon the public.  While our youth ignorantly sit around listening to ghetto nursery rhymes, the rest of the world is having a field day with our stupidity.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This is one of The BEST movies ever made, point blank.
6304211740|1.0|I regret to say that I do not feel there were many redeeming qualities to this version of Jane Eyer. In my opinion, it turned out to be a different story entirely. The lack of feeling and desire between Jane and Mr. Rochester irritated me greatly. After reading the book, this was such an unrewarding experience for me! I have found to love the book better than any I have ever read. As I realize that it would be difficult to portray this novel in a movie well...it sure could have tried harder! Where is the spirit, the drive, the passion?! Having left out some very valuable scenes and changing the ones that were used was a complete insult, I feel, to the author of the story. She would roll over in her grave 20 times over! <BR>The young Jane was perfect for the part and had the ability to do the novel justice. Too bad it all fell flat with the story changed as it was. Did they not read the book before they made a movie on it!?! Somebody read the book!
6305470464|5.0|This movie is awesome! If you're into deep, conceptual movie plots this is good movie for you to see. The first time I rented this movie I watched it three times in a row. The message this movie sends is powerful and uplifting.
B00005221M|5.0|The movie is underrated.  Considering the bevy of 5-star reviews, and heaps of praise contained in all the reviews how can one consider this movie underrated?  Simple it might just be the best movie out there.  <br />This is not some change the world, vision of hope, profound- breakthrough-in-cinema-type movie.  It is simply the culmination of all things that make a movie entertaining.  And that's why we (at least I) go to the movies--TO BE ENTERTAINED.<br />The acting?  Amazing.  Daniel Day-Lewis easily a top ten all-time actor.  He even made &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; watchable, a true testament to his acting abilities.  <br />The Action?  The scenes are fast paced yet not over the top.  Made even more amazing by the fantastic score(discussed later).<br />The Romance?  Believable and intense.  Madeleine Stowe in her prime.  Not an overbearing story but adds another great facet to the movie.<br />The music?  Best original score ever.  No comparisons.  I dare you not to feel uplifted during the last orchestra piece.  Dare you.<br />Those are just the main points.  There's a great father/son/brother relationship.  There's a great character in the jealous ex-lover as well as the fantasticly &quot;Evil&quot; Magua.  And the best thing about the movie?  there's no down time.  there is not one minute when you wish it would speed up.  Not one scene you think should have been left on the cutting room floor.  All without feeling like you're missing anything.  Fantastic.<br />#1 Movie on my list of best movies of all time.
1573226521|5.0|I was blown away by Alex's novel.  Being a fiction writer myself I know how difficult it is to take your readers on the journey you've planned out, but Alex does all that and more. He left me breathless with each chapter and strayed from boring sequences some authors rely on. The story was the best I've read in years and he's paved the way for new young authors such as myself with his captivation of this story. Alex has outdone himself and I plan on reading more of his books. The film did not do the book justice in any way shape or form. This is a superb book with an exciting beginning, an entertaining middle and an incredible ending.  The Beach is for readers who love their books raw, realistic and fun!

B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I don't like this one as much as I liked Mer de Noms.<br />I tend to think of A Perfect Circle as Maynard getting in touch with his feminine side--it's softer, prettier, breathes a little more.  And, the first CD was just gorgeous--this is more a reversion to type, too much Tool in it.
B00009P1O0|5.0|Neil Young's 1974 release On The Beach is considered one of his classic albums, but for some reason the album was never released on compact disk.  Finally, the album has made its way to the digital age and Mr. Young's fans can enjoy one of his most blisteringly savage albums.  After his record label rejected his eulogy to two lost friends, Tonight's The Night, Mr. Young came up with the ragged edged On The Beach.  The album opens with \\"Walk On\\", Mr. Young's rebuttal to Lynyrd Skynyrd's rebuttal of him as well as a rebuking of the press who criticized him during his 1973 tour.  \\"See The Sky About To Rain\\" confronts a similar environmental topic as \\"After The Gold Rush\\" and has an eerie organ and a haunting steel guitar played evocatively by long time cohort Ben Keith.  \\"Revolution Blues\\" is a dark and disturbing song about a cult and the terror they may inflict on the wealthy residents of the Laurel Canyon that is clearly inspired by the Manson family.  The song's music belies the dark tone of the lyrics with shimmering guitars that undercut the subject matter.  It is very good song, but Mr. Young would go onto to perform the song acoustically on the subsequent tour that would better capture the stark nature of the song. \\"For The Turnstiles\\" is a brilliant song that is driven by a stuttering, bluegrass banjo and was inspired by the stadium tour he had just completed with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.  Mr. Young was clearly disturbed by the fact that big business was starting to take over rock and roll and art was suffering for commerce.  The song foretells of the selling out of musicians and the forming of corporate rock.  \\"Vampire Blues\\" is a stinging commentary about the oil business.  Both the title track and \\"Motion Pictures\\" are self-reflective songs, the former about sacrifices for a career and the latter about his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgrass.  The album's final track, \\"Ambulance Blues\\" is one of Mr. Young's masterpieces.  Clocking in at almost nine minutes long, the song tackles numerous subjects including some recurring themes of Mr. Young's music like the pillaging of the land and its native people, dirty politicians, depression and his childhood.  The song is sparse and mostly acoustic.  It is a loose tribute to a hero of Mr. Young's, an English folkie, Bert Jansch. The song actually clips its beat from a Mr. Jansch song.  On The Beach has the mournful qualities of Tonight's The Night, but unlike its predecessor that offered only bleakness, this album finds Mr. Young beginning to find some light.minutes long, the song tackles numerous subjects including some recurring themes of Mr. Young's music like the pillaging of the land and its native people, dirty politicians, depression and his childhood.

B0000AFQS0|5.0|After watching the newly-restored DVD of The Kids Are Alright, all I keep saying is Wow.  This is the greatest collection of The Who and their performances.  From their TV appearance on The Smothers Brothers to their final performance with Keith Moon at Shepperton, the movie just blew me away.  And it looks crystal-clear, and sounds excellent. I recommend this to any Who fan. Go get it!
B00005JLKB|5.0|Throughout history, directors and writers have put their spin on familiar stories. This handsome DVD set beautifully presents (in a &quot;matted&quot; widescreen format that looks good even on a 20&quot; TV) the Alfred Gough and Miles Millar version of the Superman story. Its creators offer their comments on 2 episodes, while deleted scenes, storyboards, and a self-guided tour of Clark Kent's home town round out the package.<br />&quot;Smallville&quot; is not without a sense of humor, but unlike &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; &quot;Lois and Clark,&quot; or the &quot;Superman&quot; movies, this series is a drama minus any campiness or tongue-in-cheek. If you manage to look beyond the talented cast, you'll find the set design and photography beautiful, and the visual effects  startling even at a time when expensive effects are everywhere. The resulting stories go beneath the typical comic book surface to be engrossing, surprising, and often compelling. Freed at last from the on-screen ads and commercial breaks, &quot;Smallville&quot; is a wonder.
6305171769|3.0|The first was great, the second was good, but 3-6 were completely rubbish so with this film I was not expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that H20 is as good as the second film. Basically it completely ignores the stories of the last four sequals and begins 20 years after the first Halloween. With Jamie Lee Curtis making a long awaited return to the series as Micheal's long suffering little sister. The film complete forgets the fact that Lorrie had a Daughter who featured in the Halloweens 4 through 6 and instead gives her a son (Josh Hartnett) who secretly stays at a bording school when his mother thinks he has gone on a school trip.<BR>Of course the &quot;Shape&quot; turns up for some late night classes and terrorizes the young group of partiers.<BR>LL Cool J gives some light comic relief as the security guard who wishes to be a romantic novelist.

0676973760|5.0|More than three centuries ago, Jean de La Fontaine wrote that \\"fables show us the truth under the guise of lies [my translation]\\" (Le Dépositaire infidèle, IX, 1).  This is particularly the case with stories that feature talking animals.<BR>  <BR>However, as a fable, Life of Pi goes further than the truth/lie dichotomy in that Martel's novel points to the importance of myths not only in making sense of what cannot be explained, but also, as a tool for survival.  Pi and Richard Parker, the Royal Bengal tiger with whom he shares his lifeboat, survive at sea for 227 days finally to land on a Mexican beach.  <br />Questioned by officials about the demise of the Japanese cargo ship that left two survivors only, Pi and Richard Parker, the 450-pound tiger, Pi proposes two accounts of the sinking of the Tsimtsum and lets the Japanese officials (the reader) choose which of the two accounts, the one with animals or the other, without animals, they want to believe.  Both investigators, Mr. Chiba and Mr. Okamoto decide to believe \\"[t]he story with animals.\\"  Reason might have it that the story without animals is the more believable, yet how can one disagree with the investigators?  The first story, the one with animals, is indeed the \\"better story\\" and perhaps the truer. <BR>  Life of Pi tells about the power of 'stories' and, by extension, that of the human imagination, where myths are born.  This novel may be \\"all about storytelling\\" (The Globe and Mail) But the heart might have it that Life of Pi is all about myths (faith) as the ultimate source of sustenance.  Only a tiger-at-heart could survive Pi's ordeal.<BR>  The distinction between humans and animals is tenuous and truth, mostly overrated.  To return to La Fontaine, truth is often best and most convincingly presented wrapped in lies. <BR>  Life of Pi is to a certain extent a retelling of the Bible's rather fanciful Noah's Ark 'story.' And if Mr. Okamoto thinks the story with animals is the \\"better story,\\" as Pi says,\\"so it goes with God.\\"  He may well be right.<BR>Life of Pi is a landmark.  Enjoy!

It is a story of friendship, and how careful with it you need to be. I know that this movei got a BAD WRAP but it really isnt that bad. But I would say it is the type of movie that you Like or Hate. Nothing in the middle. If you like Las vegas, and you enjoy a movie than pushes so limits..

B00008S2VG|5.0|It surprises me on some people's reaction to Madonna's new album.  The first time I listened to it I wasn't sure what to make of it or if I liked it or not.  But then I waited a few days before listening to it again.  I was in love with it.  It's a brilliant album, and I think a lot of people just don't understand what she was attempting to accomplish with it.  I'd have to say technically it's her best album to date; however, her first one is still my favorite.<br />You see, when Ray of Light came out I thought it sucked big time.  I only liked Ray of Light and Frozen.  I had just stopped doing the rave thing, and I thought what the heck is she doing.  So I didn't listen to it again for a good month or so.  Then I really liked it and thought what the heck was I thinking.  I put it into perspective...Madonna has always created dance music, and trance would be the next logical step for her.  Being a top 40 artist, America was ready for this style of techno.  Anything else at that time probably wouldn't have gone over so well.<br />Then Music came out, I was madly in love with that song.  But I again didn't care for the album, with the exception of Don't Tell Me.  I waited 3 or 4 weeks and again found myself saying, &quot;What the hell were you thinking?&quot;<br />So, by now, I hope that you're getting the point of my rambling on.  Wait a month before listening to it again.  Then, when you do, be with yourself alone, turn the volume up, really listen to the lyrics, and keep an open mind.  Sure, it's more introspective and personal then any of her other albums.  Sure, it may not be as dance oriented as you would prefer.  I think that's why so many people really have a problem with it.  But if you truly listen to American Life, the lyrics, the musical composition, and the beats and buildups of them in the songs, you will have an epiphany and understand the genius of this album and just how brilliant it really is.  It's a very powerful and moving album that makes Madonna shine in a new and different light.<br />If you don't like this album you simply just aren't truly listening to it.  Or you have a problem with taking Madonna seriously as a talented musical artist.  Or like most mindless drones you're afraid of change and like to stay stuck in the past.  Or you don't like top 40/pop/trance music, and you shouldn't be reviewing this album. Just keep an open mind and simply give it a chance.  You'll see that it somehow gets under your skin...onna shine in a new and different light.<br />If you don't like this album you simply just aren't truly listening to it.

6304539258|3.0|A film review by Vladredski rejects the conceptually flawed emotional polarities of ordinary reviews, and focuses on what in Truth matters to us all:  1) the film's Beauty, 2) the film's literal, analogical, and/or metaphorical treatment of Death, and 3) what the film should inspire a person to do if he or she could become Invisible and Travel in Time.   Star Wars.  What is beautiful about this film is that it can be &quot;seen as&quot; the nightmare of a dying Priest who, while wondering in the Woods pondering God, ate a poisonous mushroom by Chance.  For if one looks beyond the colorful characters, which remind me of food poisoning, one sees the classic Christian melodrama, rendered Catholic by its Baroque qualities, as well as characters struggling within the mystical binary of Good and Evil.  Within this, the figure of Darth Vader deserves special attention.  Our feelings toward him mirror the ambiguious feelings we have toward Satan in our real lives.  While we admire his power, and sense of style, we know that cultivating these feeling only leads to Hell.  Chubacca, a thinly veiled mockery of Saint Thomas Aquinas, is also an intriging character, though I think Mr. Lucas should have given him (or is it a her) a little more sophistocation.   Death.  Star Wars touches on Death in a least two very interesting ways.  In the familiar-seeming, yet different, world of Star Wars, what happens when a person dies?  I tremble when I think about this too long.  Second, do C3PO and R2D2 have Souls?  If not, why do they care what happens.  Invisibility/Time Travel.  I would use these powers to visit Mr Lucas at night, in his room, in the late 1970s, and say: Good, but stop here.   Star Wars rings seven of twelve Bells mounted in a wooden frame.
B0000B3FCX|1.0|Heard good things about the new Nickelback album. I must say however,it's no good. I can't comprehend how some people say how good it is,I find it quite the bore!To each there own I guess. <BR>The opening track is quite good,and 'someday' is excellent,however after that the album lacks originality and melody. Loud guitars are good when they are purposeful,not just whacked in for the sake of it. <BR>Give it a miss if you're not a Nickelback fan.

0440213525|1.0|Kid knows something that bad guys want kept quiet. But the bad guys aren't going to kill the kid to keep him quiet - only if he talks (at which point killing him doesn't do any good???)  The premise is completely backwards.<br />The kid's lawyer is such a moron, she can't figure out that if the kid's testimony is preserved through deposition, there's no point in the bad guys killing him... but that as long as the kid is the only one with the information, killing the kid is a viable alternative.  <br />The whole book is all about the &quot;struggle&quot; to decide what to do. A logical and more entertaining approach to the plot would have been:<br />Page 1: Kids learns secret.  <BR>Page 2: Kid testifies to facts under oath.  <BR>Page 3: THE END<br />...Which only tells you how horribly bad this book is.  Such a HUGE logical flaw, should have sent the author in search of another plot, but instead he blunders through an homage to bad writing, apparently unaware such gross inconsistencies reduce a book to mere wasted paper.  <br />Dumb!  Dumb!  Dumb!<br />Do NOT waste your time or your money.
B00008WT5C|5.0|AC/DC's \\"Let There Be Rock\\" is just as good as any Bon Scott album except for one striking difference: it rocks with a particularly fierce aggression you won't find in much of the group's pre- \\"Back in Black\\" material.  The brothers Young are completely at the top of their game, as their guitars project with demanding authority on tracks like the dynamic title cut and \\"Overdose.\\" \\"Let There Be Rock\\" is also known for signature classics like \\"Bad Boy Boogie,\\" \\"Whole Lotta Rosie,\\" and the catchy \\"Problem Child.\\"  Listening to this album also helped me come to a realization: the more I listen to early AC/DC, the more I favor vocalist Bon Scott.  With no disrespect to Brian Johnson, I have to say that Bon's voice had a commanding personality that complimented the music pretty well.  It's as much a vital instrument as Angus's guitar.  But getting back to this album: it's a thoroughly enjoyable CD with zero filler and rocks 100% of the time.  Like any AC/DC record, if you're not listening to \\"Let There Be Rock\\" at maximum volume, you're not listening to it at all.

B000089RVR|5.0|Dido's followup &quot;Life For Rent&quot; was long overdue. I've been a fan of hers since &quot;No Angel&quot;--her debut CD--which was released in 1999. I listened to that album almost every day, never tiring of it like I do with most other artists. I had high expectations for &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, and did this album come through! &quot;No Angel&quot; in my opinion, is slightly better. &quot;Here With Me&quot; and &quot;Honestly OK&quot; will always be two of my favoriote tracks for the rest of my life. I think these two songs have the ability to inspire people throughout the years, and really stand against the test of time--much like the Beatles have. But &quot;Life For Rent&quot; is just as haunting, and even BETTER in some aspects than &quot;No Angel&quot; was. For one thing, Dido has greatly matured--her sound is more polished, and her beats more powerful. Her lyrics are breathtaking, and with each tune -- a vignette. &quot;See You When You're 40&quot; is beautiful but bitter. &quot;See the Sun&quot; is sad but hopeful, and &quot;Mary's in India&quot; surprises you with its theme of infidelity because of its sweet score. Each song tells a story one worth listenting to. This album is fantastic; all biases aside, Dido's still got it. And like I said before, its even better in some ways. Congrats!

B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is neither Pink Floyd's greatest nor their most popular album, but it is without a doubt one of the most misunderstood and brilliant albums of all time. Representing a number of paradoxes that the average music listener never takes into account before listening, The Wall has been transformed from a mainstream billboard topping release into a most cherished underground album.<br />In order to fully comprehend the album it is a necessity to take into account a number of factors not on the album. Of chief importance were the socio-political issues of the 1970s, and the vast transformation mainstream music was taking from the more serious rock `n roll into the mindless disco beats. Conceptually The Wall is about conformity, and yet at the same time it's about not conforming. Proposing the first of many paradoxes contained within the album.<br />Upon release it was immediately hailed as a classic by society at large, to paraphrase another reviewer, it was the album to have. The well-received greeting the album had can almost entirely be attributed to the songs Another Brick in the Wall (part2), and Comfortably Numb. In fact to this day they probably comprise ninety percent of the total airplay The Wall receives. And over the course of the following decades the majority of the remaining twenty-four songs faded into near complete obscurity with few exceptions. This can be mostly attributed to two reasons: The morass of the album as a whole, and the depressing tone of the rest of the album.<br />Another reviewer said it best, \\"It's very difficult to sit through a complete listening, not only because the album is so long, but also because it's so miserable in tone.\\" Yet his statement brings about another paradox, while the album is long, and decidedly miserable its also very difficult not to sit through a complete listening because its almost impossible to fragment the album, listen to the fragments and take from them any kind of understanding.<br />While the tone The Wall takes is miserable it's also necessary. Not a single aspect of the plot is something light, casual, or cheerful. Although its overwhelming depression, The Wall still manages to momentarily coalesce into something joyous even if the subject matter is revolting. Most notably the songs One of My Turns, Bring the Boys Back Home, Waiting For the Worms, and The Trial.<br />The plot of the album can be viewed two ways. Some prefer to think it's a good look into the psychology of the human mind, especially when confronted with being excluded. While others prefer to think of the album as a very imaginative and creative story. Regardless of which stance you take, the plot is a startlingly vivid and disturbing look at the dangers of conformity, and mass media propaganda. <br />In the end the most important thing to remember before listening to The Wall is that while yes it is depressing, and that yes it's subject matter is shocking, its designed to be. Nothing about the albums contents are to be taken lightly, this is not an album that can provide background music at a party. It is however an extremely creative and thought provoking album, unique in more ways then one. Highly recommended for anyone who looks to get more out of music then just simple thrills.
B0000AGQ6Y|5.0|The first time i saw Scarface I thought there was nothing that could top that movie into I witnessed The Professional.It has incredible acting with a young Natalie Portman,Jean Reno,Danny Aiello,and Gary Oldman who plays the best crooked cop and quite possible the best villian ever.The Synopsis is a little girl's(Natalie Portman)family is gun downed by D.E.A. agents.Ending up in the hands of a professional hitman(Jean Reno)a romance blossoms between a man and a little girl.The little girl with no where to go learns from the hitman where she soon seeks revenge on the man who killed her family.The soundtrack goes perfect with the film and the ending was done perfect.I personnally recomend The Professional over Leon which is the Uncut International Film with an extra 23 mins. of footage.But you will wanna see both trust me.If you like this movie i recommend Ronin which has has Jean Reno in it playing co-star the the talented Robert Deniro
0425188809|4.0|Watchers was a great thriller and extremely well written.  <br />Two beings were created in a lab with near human intelligence.  One is a golden retriever normal in every way other than his intelligence.  The other is called The Outsider.  A frightful being resembling no animal or man.  Both beings escape from the lab and are free in the wild.<br />A man named Travis finds the dog and soon learns of its secret, however he is unaware that the dog still has more secrets to reveal to it.  Along the way, Travis and the dog, newly named Einstein, meet a woman named Nora.  Nora has been sheltered all her life and Travis befriends her and finds their friendship quickly grows into something more.<br />In the meantime, The Outsider is still out there.  The NSA are searching for both The Outsider and the dog which means that Travis and Nora have to watch themselves carefully.<br />Without giving anything else away, I'll just say that I completely enjoyed this book.  Animal stories always hit me right in the heart and Einstein, with his human-like intelligence, is completely endearing.  I found myself reading the book at a quick pace, always wanting more and always thinking about where I'd just left off when I wasn't able to read.  There are very few boring moments in the book.  <br />The only subplot I could have done without was that of a man named Vince who kills the scientists who created The Outsider and the dog and believes that taking lives insures his own immortality.  The entire subplot is almost ridiculous in its ending.<br />If you're an animal lover or dog lover, this book is a definite read.  You will find yourself looking after Einstein and thinking about him long after you put the book down.
B0000A1RJI|2.0|I found this to be, overall a disappointing score. Why? <BR>Because I've heard a large percentage of it before. <BR>It's no mystery why there is such a love/hate thing going on with it across the net. <BR>The &quot;love&quot; camp either can't get enough of The Rock and Gladiator (among others), or they have simply never heard enough of either score to realize that a large portion of this music is recycled. I guess I'd have to be in the &quot;hate&quot; camp. <br />I myself felt disappointed while watching the film when I heard those familiar sounding cues. It really effected the way I responded to the movie. Having pretty much heard it before, and noticing it glaringly many times throughout, I was left feeling (musically) jipped. That is not the response I'd want from an audience. I picked it up regardless hoping that maybe I missed some less recognizable cues throughout the film. But it doesn't work as a stand alone music experience for me either. The only track I've gotten any enjoyment out of is a way too short &quot;Fog Bound&quot; at 2:16. I do like some of the work that the MV guys do. But I t's very difficult to fully embrace one of their scores when it sounds mostly derivative of something they have done before. As is the case (it seems) with every Bruckhiemer production. I fell out of love (still like him though)   with James Horner for similar reasons. Swiping and re-using something you've created previously for another project is hardly something to be proud of. The success that the Media Ventures crew are enjoying would seem to me a hollow victory considering that they seem to rip themselves off so often. If that opinion makes me an elitist, then it's a label I'll live with. <br />For fans of this score, I'm glad you like it. If it effects you positively, then so be it. If you enjoy the music, who cares what anyone else thinks. But I do hope you discover the original inspiration for it at some point. It will be worth the journey. For those that don't, Icompletely understand your frustration. <br />And for those that have heard it before and don't mind or care that it is recycled and still love it . . . I admire your ability to be easily entertained.
B0000C8AUO|5.0|Bowie is once again essential and vital. In the empty days of the mid-eighties, who would have believed that almost twenty years later, DB would be creating music this good? His gradual return to form, starting at the underrated \\"Black Tie, White Noise\\" is now complete. \\"New Killer Star\\" \\"The Lonliest Guy\\" \\" Fall Dog Bombs The Moon\\" - all classic Bowie. He even sounds a bit like Steely Dan (when they were good) on the albums lyrical and vocal highlight, \\"Bring Me The Disco King\\" One weak track is the title song,\\"Reality\\". But name a great album that dosen't have at least one weak track. Also, the bonus CD does a little to enhance the album proper, \\"Fly\\" is pretty good and an interesting treatment of \\"Rebel, Rebel\\"<BR>For this long-time Bowie fan, life is good.
B00000IMCW|1.0|... The main reason anyone would want to watch this is to see some great makeup and sadly, this is the worst zombie makeup I ever saw .... The gore is the fakest of all the Romero movies - the flesh looks like rubber when it tears because that is what it is. The blood squirts out orange or pink (the blood formula used didnt take to the film stock well). What are zombies bleeding for anyway? Anyhoo, the dead are already walking around and when they're shown for the first time, it is absolutely a letdown (unlike their creepy and overwhelming entrance in DAY). Here it's inside an apartment building. But only after six minutes of talk. That's right, you don't get to the mall for at least 30-40 mins(everyone knows by now that is the setting, right?). There is no tension to the zombie attacks by hour 2. They're not scary to look at, and they're not hostile enough. In Day of the Dead, they are though. This brings me to breaking the third myth (this is an \\"ultimate horror film\\"). It's barely horror. Romero's own personal view as he has said on more than one occasion, is that Dawn is schlock, camp and outright silly. The bookends of the trilogy are where you should keep to - Night, to see how it began and Day, to see what a mature zombie movie looks like. With these, you skip the pie fights, the slapstick, the clown music, and the Noxzema faced actors in bell bottoms with not even a sign of rot. In Day there's about ten minutes of talk to sit through straight - and it's very unsettling conversation. Add up all the sporadic talk here (mostly bull about cigarettes, abortions, guns, trucks) and you will likely get a good 35 mins. So between that and zombies that are laughable, ... There are no chills here. There are no thrills that are not better done in other zombie movies. The deaths of the people in this movie are not that awful at all to witness. Only one good guy's death is semi-awful (if not predictable). The deaths in Day of the Dead are more spectacular (definitely unpredictable and nastier). The habitat of the mall in this is simply too bright and upbeat to create any sense of gloom and that seemed to be the idea Romero had - juxtaposing the so-called undead in such a paradise. In Day of the Dead the characters areholed up in an underground bunker which is far more appropriate for a horror film. Two hours with four people who have nothing to do but steal supplies from a mall is not as riveting as the Dawn Fan Club suggests. The ending is also one of the most anticlimactic in any movie.... I have no problem buying that the dead are alive, but there are so many mistakes and logic problems, you may just fast fwd to the end and look at this as a comedy. It can't be considered a true horror film. Again, for that, check out the bookends of the trilogy. ... Recommendations: Return of the Living Dead (traditional graveyard zombies), ReAnimator (morgue zombies), Night of the Living Dead 1968 Millenium version (house surrounding zombies), One Dark Night (Mausoleum zombies). BEWARE of Shock Waves ... Burial Ground (papier mache zombies), Night of the Living Dead 1990 (just slow and uneventful), any Fulci movies.
B00000IQC8|3.0|Watching the two guys in this movie was like watching Eddie Haskell and Wally Cleaver in Leave It To Beaver.  LITB was better, though, because the conversations were natural and unforced.  This movie left me with the impression that a group of comedy writers wrote the script and these guys simply mouthed it.  Nobody -- I repeat, nobody -- is capable of retorting with such sharp responses so quickly as these guys were doing.  The think time between one guy's statement and the next guy's response was in the sub-second range.  Also, the humor was juvenile -- not very sophisticated, with a false sense of erudition on the part of Eddie Haskell.
B00005JM0B|2.0|After seeing this film in the theater's the only question I had was as to whether or not the film makers even bothered to watch the first two films at all.  This film only goes on to insult the real fans of the first two with its simplistic story and character elements, overly exaggerated action sequences, and a tongue and cheek representation of itself.  When Cameron made the first two films, his main focus was to try and ground them in reality while establishing large scale themes such the future is not set in its path, we can make our own choices as to how we live our lives.  The point of the first two films was to show how we ourselves can decide our path, thus that is why the future war remained in it's place, the future.  It was never supposed to become a certainty in its occurence, only a possibility.  T3 decides to ignore this, however, and simply cover itself by telling the audience that the future can never be changed only delayed in its occurence, thus cancelling out the entire drive of the first two terminators.  This third installment would have made more sense if they chose to set it in the future war setting as a prequel to the first two films than as a sequel.  That way you could have shown how all the incidents of the first two films resulted.  You could show how the terminator from T2 was captured by the resistence and then used to help them infiltrate Skynetwith a small squad of soldiers, perhaps even having that terminator progammed to protect Kyle Reese as they do to ensure his destiny.  This would lead to Reese thus being sent back in time when they discover that Skynet during the attack sent a terminator back in time with its program to hunt down Sarah Connor.  You could then finish with Skynet in a last attempt at survival releasing its new prototype weapons, a set of T-1000's, on the remaining resistence group.  Realizing what has happened with Reese, Skynet would thus establish a plan B scenario where it sends one of the T-1000's back in time should Kyle be successful.  As its forces fall to the T-1000's, the remaining resistance group in Skynet manage to send back the captured T-800 to combat with the T-1000 thus bring together the circular cycle of Cameron's vision of destiny and humanity.  Do they do this however, no.  Instead the filmmakers of T3 decide to regurgitate many aspects of the first two films, raising the action to unrealistic proportions while dumbing down the narrative for their own amusement.  I do not know about other fans of the series, but I liked the seriousness that the first two films enstowed and how they took their time to respect the audience in how they came together.  T3 manages to insult not only the audience with what it feels it is trying to do but also its entire series with what it is trying to say, that we do not need to make the story fit, we simply need to string together a couple of words and action sequences to get your hard earned dollars.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|The digitally restored &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; with Errol Flynn &amp; Olivia DeHaviland is a real treat! Join Robin &amp; his merry band in this swashbuckling movie as they steal from the rich &amp; give to the poor &amp; liberate England from Prince John. Marvelous restoration! Includes 2 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; of Bugs &amp; Daffy in their versions of &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (Yoiks and away! SLAM!)
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck did it again!  Sea Change is an eclectic mix of rock, folk, country, and classical as only Beck could conceive and perform it.  The CD is downright beautiful and will capture your imagination with it's memorable compositions.  I cannot stop obsessing over it, and another great release by a certain singer/songwriter named Steven Delopoulos, who has a masterful CD out called 'Me Died Blue'.  Great songcraft, passionate vocals, and meditteranean musical nuances to go with a man and his acoustic guitar!  If anyone tells you music stinks these days, just point them in the direction of Beck and Steven Delopoulos!  These guys are 2 of the most heartfelt and creative artists out now!
0780020685|5.0|I now understand why Akira Kurosawa is one of the greatest directors of all time. He has made truly one of the greatest movies ever made, The Seven Samurai.<br />For those of you who don't know what the movie's about, it takes place in 16th century Japan. Around that time, bandits were raiding villages and taking farmers' crops and just wreaking havoc. One of the villages does not want to go down like that. So, the elder of the village, Gisaku (played by Kuninori Kudo, who does a great job), decides to hire 4 samurai to save the village. He compromises later with a villager and gets seven. <br />The movie has a great epic feel to it, and has some of the best acting ever. My favorite, and I'm sure a lot of people who's seen this probably agree with me, actor was Isao Kimura, who played the adventurous Katsushiro. His speech about farmers was one of the best speeches in a movie I've seen in a while. (Next to Robert DeNiro's angry speech in Mean Streets.) Takashi Shimura was also perfect in his role as the samurai posing as a monk. <br />This is the completed version of the movie, which should be the ONLY way to watch this. Yes, it's very long, but it helps the story, and unlike some movies now that add extra footage that hurts the movie (Apacolypse Now, The Exorcist), this really REALLY helps the movie. It's a classic tale, a lot like Shakespeare.<br />Though I don't think this is the greatest movie of all time (that would be Scorsese's Mean Streets.), it's in my top 5. GO SEE IT NOW!
1558216340|4.0|Good reading but unbelieble if one considers the 4000 mile  journey across what even today is forbidden and desolate country. Why did it take so long to come up with this story.  All those that survived just faded away.  Consider  the american engineer alone, he would certainly have known the value of this story regarding Books and movie rights.  I think this book could not have survived scrutiny right after the war  At that time the story could have easily  been checked but making this such an accidental discovery some 50 years later makes verification impossible
B00003CXBK|5.0|The Movie was absolutely spectacular. I remember the first time I watched it at my house with a friend. It was on T.V. and we only saw the second half, (May I remind you this Movie is very long and your butt will get sore, and that was just the first half.) I was never a big fan of anime then. But this Movie totally blew me away. The only thing that threw me off was the boars in their demon form. (Covered in vains or maggots and throwing up gallons of blood.) I loved the design of the main characters and the fact that Miyazaki saw both sides of the enemies and made it so that no one was evil. You felt bad for both humans and animals. No bad guys. That's what American movies are all about. Any way I reccomend this and The Rurouni Kenshin OVA's and Spirited Away. I don't even watch Disney any more it lost its touch a long time ago. If you want twisted plots, memorable characters, and unexpected endings go for Anime!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Who cares if they're marketed as gay or the real thing?? This is a short, but brilliant album.  All The Things is powerful pop, but Show Me Love could give it a run for its money......a confident pop song which just lifts my spirits....and how about a wonderfully faithful rendition of that Smiths classic How Soon Is Now??? Brill.  Top track is the gorgeous Stars....a tender ballad which mises Russian rap and an angelic chorus.  Get over the hype.....this is a brill cd
B00004ZEQX|1.0|This review is of the Diamond release of this film.  The movie itself is a superb entry into Fulci's body of work and Italian horror movies in general.  It has more taut suspense and more competent gore/effects than most other films in the genre.  This particular DVD however is one of the most poorly authored comercial DVDs I've ever seen.  First, the movie is broken into only 4 chapters, making finding a particular scene quite difficult and time consuming.  Second, the picture quality is in the fair to poor range (think pre-viewed VHS).  Third, the sound quality is that of a worn and warped record, with plenty of hiss and pops to compete with the mono soundtrack.  And finally (and also the most egregious offense), if you watch through the credits, at some point the screen will go black for about two minutes, then there's some digital blocking, followed by ten or so seconds of something (I'm not sure what, perhaps a trailer for the movie), and finally the screen turns blue and reads: &quot;Laser disc stop side-B&quot;!  Hmmm, I wonder what they transfered this DVD from.  The only thing that makes this disc at all worth buying is the movie on it and its price.  If you really need to save the money, buy this disc.  But, if you want a good film in a good transfer on a good disc, buy the Anchor Bay edition.  I sure wish I had bought that one first.
B00008S2VG|4.0|No the best Madge cd by far (that accolade belongs to Bedtime Stories) but AL does improve upon Ray of Light and Music (some great tracks on those albums but not as consistent as AL).  On AL Madge really reveals herself to the world in an amost confessional oratory placed to simple backing beats which work effectively, if not occasionally weirdly.   The title track is an unusual Madge track but does work well....I particularly love the rap where she feels super dooper n her Mini Cooper....tacky but fun...the lass ain't afraid to mock herself and I lvoe that tongue in cheek attitude.  Hollywood is more indictful again but with tongue firmly in cheek.....biting the hand that feeds??? Maybe, but the songs rox.  Top trax definitely got to Mother and Father, another song about her mother, and it is apparent that her demise still affects her....this is a stunningdance tune with straight forward lyrics......Nothing Fails, an ode to Mr Ritchie is stunning and builds up into a nice crescendo with a full choir in tow.....Love Profusion is deliriously happy tune, which is rare in the Madonna camp these days.  Some cracker tunes....a few beastly ones (namely the Bond theme tune.....still to find a mix of that song I like).  I'd love to get all instrospective about the Malbum's contents but the lyrics speak for themselves....Mirwais and Madge have just done a tremendous job putting together a more consistent album and a nice welcome back to Mrs R.....still the unchallenged Queen of Pop.
B00000DCHD|4.0|One could probably make the argument that along with The Stranger, 52nd Street transformed Billy Joel from a struggler to a star.  It's easy to see why.  &quot;Big Shot&quot; is a hard-rocking opener that features Joel's valiant effort at a Stones guitar lick.  It's one of the better-known songs from the album, along with &quot;Honesty&quot; and &quot;My Life&quot;.  It seems like everybody knows these three.  Side one (from the vinyl days) concludes with the jazzy &quot;Zanzibar&quot;.<BR>&quot;Stiletto&quot; kicks off the second half with a pervasively dark sound to match Joel's bitter lyrics about a woman from which there is no escape.  The album lightens up a bit with &quot;Rosalinda's Eyes&quot; and &quot;Half a Mile Away&quot;.  These are two jazzier numbers that I personally don't enjoy; the former number is too meandering and the latter seems generic.  All this is merely prelude, however, to &quot;Until the Night&quot;.<br />Upon this album's release in 1979, a certain major music magazine referred to &quot;Until the Night&quot; as the closest anyone has come to caputuring the essence of Phil Spector.  Joel paints a glorious portrait of longing to the backdrop of a pounding piano line, castanets, orchestra, and a showstopping saxophone solo (which bears an intriguing resemblance to the solo in Springsteen's &quot;Jungleland&quot;).  &quot;Until the Night&quot; ranks with Joel's most underrated songs; it is the highlight of the album and a personal favorite.<br />Finally, almost like an afterthought, Joel &quot;slips it to us short and sweet&quot; with the title track.  It's a nice little lounge song, then the album is over.  Overall, Joel seems to be on autopilot with a few tunes, but the album is solid and there's nothing reprehensible about it.  Along with The Stranger, it functions as a great introduction to the career of Billy Joel.
B0000C7PSW|4.0|\\"Want One\\" finds Rufus Wainwright in a desperate state: unloved, abandoned and hopeless. The aching, burning romaticism of his brilliant debut CD,and even the hope of love still evident on his extraordinary follow-up, \\"Poses\\" have disappeared. In their place is Rufus armoured against a \\"vicious world\\" without much hope of redemption. With \\"Want One\\" he has created a heartbreaking, deeply affecting collection of songs that is more stream of consciousness than polish and craft.<br />Although the music and lyrics are not as tightly focused as his two previous outings, his superior musical gifts and instincts are still quite evident. The songs \\"Dinner at Eight\\" \\"Harvestor of Hearts\\" and \\"Natasha\\" contain striking, beautiful melodies and lyrics worthy of Stephen Soundheim. But the point of this cd is that the world is a chaotic, lonely, and confusing place. The songs, therefore, reflect this lack of focus and the sorrow that accompanies hopelessness. With these unpolished, yet highly intimate songs, it feels as if we are listening to the singer's private thoughts-sometimes rambling but always poignant and moving.<br />It took me (similar to many others) many listenings to appreciate the subtle nuances of each song. Your patience, however, will be rewarded. \\"Want One\\" is the most heart wrenching, touching collection of songs you are ever likely to hear. Rarely has an artist communicated his pain so vividly and with such originality.
0385504209|4.0|This is a wonderful plot, and a step up from Dan Brown's previous works.  Although he keeps the same storyline -- Robert Langdon gets a call in the middle night, is drawn in to solve a grizzly murder with the help of a beautiful and smart woman -- this plot is rich in its historical facts and details, alluding to theology, art history, and symbology.<br />The only drawback (pardon me for being so critical) is that Brown's writing style reminds me of books recommended for 9th grade readers. It is a simple style he uses, and his characters necessarily take on a 2-dimensional nature.<br />The richness of the plot carries the day, however, and the simple and \\"young\\" writing tyle proves little more than a distraction.
0441172717|4.0|Frank Herbert's 1965 novel, &quot;Dune,&quot; is a work of startling depth and of lingering relevance to current readers.  Creating a civilization out of bits and pieces of European feudalism, Arab and Islamic traditions, startlingly modern geopolitics, ecology, and an advanced handling of cultural mythopoetics, Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; is far more than a simple &quot;sci-fi&quot; adventure tale.  Like JRR Tolkien's earlier &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; saga, Herbert fashioned a novel which has endured for 40 years because of its ability to appeal to so many readers in so many different ways.  <br />&quot;Dune&quot; begins when the 15 year old heir, Paul Atreides, is preparing to leave his lush homeworld, Caladan, with his father Duke Leto and his mother, the Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica, for their newly assigned fief, the desert planet, Arrakis (also known as the eponymous Dune).  We are constantly reminded by the narrator and the characters that the political balance between the noble Houses of the Landsraad confederation is highly precarious - that plots within plots and feints within feints are to be found in any kind of political or economic maneuvre.  Accordingly, the Atreides takeover of Arrakis is in a constant state of danger.  The family they are replacing, the Harkonnens, led by the scheming evil of the nefarious and repulsive Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (who for good measure is coded as sexually-deviant) plots with the family of the Emperor to disgrace and unseat House Atreides.  When the Imperial-Harkonnen plot succeeds in murdering Duke Leto Atreides, and forcing Paul and his mother into the deep desert, the true action of the novel begins.  <br />The most valuable thing in Herbert's universe is the Spice, Melange, which is only found in the deserts of Arrakis, guarded, surrounded, and even produced by the dangerous giant sandworms. It is at the heart of many of the novel's conspiracies and power plays.  In Herbert's anti-techonology universe, Spice enables mysteriously deformed members of the Spacing Guild to warp space for interplanetary travel; it opens the mystic order of the Bene Gesserit to extra-sensory perception; and most tellingly for &quot;Dune,&quot; it gives the indigenous population of Arrakis, the Fremen, blue-within-blue eyes.  It is to the Fremen that Paul Atreides and his mother must appeal, and even depend, to retake Arrakis.  The water-zealous Fremen, living in the deepest desert regions, believe that Paul is the Mahdi, the savior of their legends.<br />Caught between politics and religion, Paul Atreides (known to the Fremen as both Usul and Muad'dib) becomes, if he wasn't before, the focal point of the novel.  In a novel in which plots, breeding programs, and martial training seem to argue for the ability of people to control their own destinies, Paul cannot seem to escape the notion that the path of his own life is horribly fated.  As the Fremen religious figurehead, Muad'dib, Paul spends the greatest part of the novel tortured by the idea that he cannot avoid the destiny he is hurtling toward, envisioning a future where his sect will terrorize the universe in an unstoppable jihad.  <br />Of course, there is much more to say about Herbert's &quot;Dune,&quot; but I think it appropriate to mention just one more thing which really appealed to me in the novel.  Along the lines of fate/free will, each chapter of the novel is tellingly prefaced by quotations from books, either about or related to the history of Muad'dib (note, not &quot;Paul&quot;), most of which are attributed to Princess Irulan (the daughter of the Emperor when the action of the novel begins).  The prefatory excerpts, one of which actually begins the text of the novel, perform an intertextual struggle with Paul's own self-doubts throughout the novel.  While Paul wonders if he can change his own fate, Irulan's excerpts, written from a time clearly after the action of the novel, seem to confound his attempts, adding a melancholy sense of fatalism to Herbert's novel.  For me this renders Paul-Muad'dib less an epic hero than a tragic victim of a tale much larger and longer than this novel could contain.  Brief allusions to our own Earth as part of the novel's distant past should cause us to reflect even further, as Tolkien's &quot;Ring&quot; novels do, on our own individual relationships to each other, to our world, and to our relationships to power.  For an ostensibly &quot;sci-fi&quot; novel to do all of this, for me, is remarkable.
B00005JM0B|2.0|but, as much as I tried to like this film, it just doesn't hold up.  The Terminator stories was never about machines and it wasn't really about John Conner either.  For me, The Terminator movies were really about Sarah Conner.  She was what I was really interested in and how she dealt with the future.  In the first movie, she was a normal young woman.  Going to work, dealing with bad dates, etc.  Then she finds out her son is the savior of humankind.  Watching her deal with this, find a man she grows to love, and protecting her son's future was what made that movie worth seeing.  The action was great, the special effects were cool for their time, but it was her story that made that movie.<br />T2 was a continuation of her story.  We see her older, tougher.  Sarah has become the protector and I loved seeing what she had transformed into.<br />T3 was a good film.  It had great action, wonderful humor, and the story was pretty good, even if it seemed like a rerun of T2.  <br />But I almost wish that they had stopped with T2.  Because the terminator series was really the story of Sarah Conner.  It's too bad.  I really wanted to like this movie.
B0000CABJ1|1.0|I am a long time fan of Donna Summer, but &quot;Enough is Enough&quot;.  This package is the same as any other Greatest hits package that Donna has put out. She does offer 2 new songs, WOW I'M JUST SO HAPPY! NOT!!!  If you are a new fan then get her Anthology which contains over 30 songs from her entire career.  I'm just giving up and not even dreaming for new material.  I'm sure her next venture will be &quot;The Ultimate Donna Summer&quot; then lets not forget her 2005 release &quot;The Journey Part 2&quot; with 2 new original songs.
B00000ILDE|5.0|but there are plenty of reviews here telling you that and also telling you why it's such a wonderful movie.  So I don't think you'll mind if I respond to one of the folks that left a review.  Jason Reynolds III of Houston, TX, man, when you wrote that review what were you thinking?  <br />Did you watch Alien and Aliens all the way through?  From beginning to end?  Because if you did, my friend, you'd know that there was no way in hell you would be able to reason with these creatures.  So what if they followed some ancient religion that required they kill any species not their own?  <br />I follow a very ancient religion, as do a few other people I know, and it's called survival of the fittest.  Fine, these aliens want to kill me for their religion.  It's their right to try but nobody is gonna tell me that I have to be politically correct and just let some aliens kill me.  And if you think Ripley or those Marines were going to think anything different than trying to stay alive, you are nuts!<br />Ripley, nor any of her crew in the first movie or the second, tried to harm these creatures.  The first move was made against them and they were knocked off one by one.  The alien itself in the first movie never tried to communicate with the people.  That road goes both ways, buddy.  And when one's life is in danger, especially if it were me, I'm not gonna waste much of my time being politically correct.  I'm gonna save my butt and ask questions later.  Ripley was only trying to survive and protect people she cared about.  Survival of the fittest, my friend, that's what these movies are about.  Keep the politics to yourself.  :)
B000001ESF|5.0|brilliant. we have assumed control. best on vinyl with pro stereo.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This cd is amazing give it some time ( about 6 listens ) then you'll love it.
B000002JS6|5.0|This album came after the death of Bon Scott, one of the most unique singers in voice and style for our time. Many people don't know, however, that the bells at the beginning of the album on the song &quot;Hells Bells&quot; are actually rung in memory of Bon. This is a great album, and one that actually has no &quot;bad&quot; songs, and all the songs are worthy of hearing actually.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Dont listen to anybody that says this album sucks because those are the type of people that listen to 50 cent and Justin Timberlake and dont apreciate &quot;real&quot; music. I dont know what to say about this cd other than wow...i got this cd a year ago and i listen to it everyday. YES u heard me right EVERYDAY and im still not sick of it. Ill be honest the first time i bought this cd ( my first radiohead cd ) i hated it. After 6 listens i finnally started understanding the album and i loved it!!! If u love alternative music then you should DEFINITLY check this album out because this band is undiscribably good.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|Finally.&quot;Bowie&quot; has returned from his long strange vacation. If you are one of those fans,who has gotten bored with the &quot;Midlife Duke&quot; of recent years,who seems to be trying to alienate as much of the fanbase as possible by releasing lame &quot;experimental sound&quot; albums,and yes,I'm throwing &quot;Earthling&quot;,&quot;Heathen&quot; and all those dreck filled albums to the mat,then you can now come out of hiding and give the man a listen.( The last full album I could listen to,by Bowie,was &quot;Day In Day Out&quot;...so it's been some time.)<br />The album starts off with the rockin' &quot;New Killer Star&quot;,and ends with the smokey,night club-esque &quot;Bring Me The Disco King&quot;. Sanwiched in between is a fine collection of different tempos and styles,but all straight forward music,no mucking it about,or screwing it around to be &quot;moderne&quot;. I was knocked off my chair to hear Bowie do a cover of Jonathan Richman's &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot;! It's not like the &quot;Repo Man&quot; version,by the Burning Sensations,but it's kind of an &quot;updated version&quot;.I also enjoyed his tribute to George Harrison,with a musically note perfect cover of the slightly obscure,&quot;Try Some Buy Some&quot;.<br />This is a definite improvement!
6303965415|4.0|Although I have read several Jane Austen books and then saw the movie, that was not the case with Persuasion.  I didn't know the story and so didn't know what to expect.  <br />I watched it the first time and was a little let down because at first it really DID seem a little boring as other viewers have mentioned in their reviews.  But then on a rainy Sunday afternoon (isn't that the best times to watch romantic movies??) I watched it again and LOVED it this time!  I think I had just missed a lot of the subtleties the first time around and think that must be the case with the viewers who submitted poor reviews...they just missed all the undercurrents and subtleties.<br />The first time I saw the movie I did not see the handsomeness or beauty in the Captain or Anne but by the end of the second viewing I was in love with the Captain and finally noticed that although Anne is mousy, she is the prettiest female in the movie.  Especially at the end when they both were just glowing.  Is that glow, especially on Anne's face, just a good makeup artist's trick or fine acting...or just a projection of how you, yourself feel about the characters by the end of the movie??  All the characters are really not very attractive looking in this movie, but I loved that because it seemed mover REAL.  How many times have you heard how beautiful some historic figure (Anne Boleyn, Marie Antionette??) was supposed to be, then saw a picture of them and thought...uggg!  Different time periods have different ideals of beauty.  From pictures that I have seen of this time period, the women really DID look like this, not like so-called modern beauties like Gweneth Paltrow as she was in Emma.<br />A couple of the scenes that I absolutely adore are where Anne is at the opera.  She is there with Mr Elliot, who wants Anne also, but only for what a marriage with her can do for him.  She is ignoring Mr Elliot, who is trying to tell Anne of his feelings and intentions, because she can see that Captain Wentworth is leaving because he can see what is going on between them.  She runs to stop the Captain from leaving begging him to stay which he will not due because of his jealousy of Mr Elliot, who is also standing there with them having this very passionate conversation.  Everyone is watching them instead of the singer!  Little, meek, spinsterish Anne now has TWO men wanting her! The other scene I love is the one where the Captain is coming over to ask Anne's father if he can marry Anne.  Her self-absorbed sister who seems to despise Anne and lords over her, and almost treats her as a servant throughout the movie, actually tells her to try not to monopolize the Captain's time when he arrives...probably so that she may have a chance at him. And when the Captain asks for Anne's hand in marriage, her father is actually in disbelief that it is Anne the Captain wants.<br />So, if you watch this the first time and didn't like it, watch it again and you will be very pleasantly surprised.
B000003C2S|5.0|ok, i dont consider Death a death metal band.  limiting it to that wouldnt be right.  chuck schuldiner was always evolving, and changing, and this album shows it.  this is the first Death album i ever got, and i love it.  good rifs, good drumming, good song structure, and good subjet matter on the lyrics. i mean,this album is what it is, not trying to be anything more, or less, its just perfect. Death had a great carreer, and its sad that Chuck lost his battle with cancer, but i definetly wont forget him , or his music, and its kinda funny saying this, but &quot;Death will live on forever.&quot;...peace
B000089RVR|5.0|with the expectations I had, i was quite sure i'm going to be so dissapointed. i'm so happy all my expectations were filled.<BR>although some others suggested this album is like the b-sides of no angel, i really don't agree. as to the melodies, which do continue the line of the previous album, it's just the style of dido - and i'm glad for that. but the lyrics are much better, the sound is different and better - more guitars, an amazing production in genneral and particularly on &quot;who makes you feel&quot; &amp; &quot;do you have a little time&quot;, and no &quot;skip 'em&quot; tracks.<BR>dido's voice is great, it goes so perfectly with the songs. the voice just sweeps you in.<BR>great melodies - &quot;white flag&quot;, &quot;life for rent&quot;, &quot;don't leave home&quot;, &quot;it's my land&quot; - this are my favourites.<BR>&quot;sand in my shoes&quot; is a great song - starts with a guitar and a quike singing, and continues as a catchy dance.<BR>dido written all the songs with other artists, and she has written the wonderful &quot;see the sun&quot; all by herself. this album puts her as one of the greatest artists today.<BR>i have one reservation though - &quot;no angel&quot; had the wonderfull &quot;dear isoble&quot; (the best song on it, in my opinion) and i don't find a great ballad in that level in &quot;life for rent&quot;.
B000002LR6|5.0|ok, this CD is pure chaos.  when you play this CD at full blast, it comes to life.  this album spawned ministrys biggest hit single &quot;jesus built my hot rod&quot;.  now, i like that song and all, but the vocals get rather annoying by the time the song ends, and if you've heard the song, you'll know what i mean.  the 3rd track &quot;tv2&quot; is insane, i can't even judge that song, its just chaos, but if you listen closely to the lyrics, it makes sense.  &quot;new world order&quot; is very chaotic and it has that repetitiveness that can get to you, but in a good way, you start to trance out to it. &quot;just one fix&quot; is so powerful, i love that song, and &quot;hero&quot; is brilliant.  now, &quot;scarecow&quot;, i love this song, dont get me wrong, but its just too long for its own good.  then comes &quot;psalm 69&quot; which has a very dark intro, and flows right into a metal riff maddness.  the track &quot;corrosion&quot; is this very chaotic dark trippy song, that has sound effects and crazy drumbeat playing.  this song is sooo weird, i love it.  then, the album closer &quot;grace&quot; is not at all on my list of listenables, i think of it as just a filler.  this album is genius, and all you nu-metal kids should put this disc in your little pop-infested CD players, and then you can hear whats up.  ministry is great, as is this album, make no mistake about it, if you want some heavy trippy grooving metal, then this is it.
0688163173|2.0|I've been a big fan of Lehane's since the very beginning, but I have to say that this book was extremely dissapointing.  I've endorsed his work to many friends and family over the years and, unfortunately, could not for this subpar effort.  I've haven't NOT finished a novel since I can remember, but almost did with this one.  Another small peeve of mine:  he's got to get off of the overused superfluous metaphor kick.  He's too good of a talent for that.
B000089RVR|5.0|I have been looking forward for quite some time to Dido's follow-up album to &quot;No Angel&quot;.  I felt that &quot;No Angel&quot; was one of the best debut albums ever by a solo woman.  I have read some reviews here where people are complaining that &quot;Life for Rent&quot; is too acoustic.  Yea, I guess I can see where that is coming from, but it really is like 2 or 3 songs that are *truly* acoustic and one of those is the hidden track.  I actually think that is not a bad thing as Dido's voice is so smooth and flowing that having an acoustic track or two helps add to the song as the &quot;stripped down&quot; version places more emphasis on her voice.<br />Here is the track listing:<br />1) &quot;White Flag&quot; - the first single from the album, great intro with the strings and a song that sounds very much like one that would have been on &quot;No Angel&quot;.  Great hook - 10/10<br />2) &quot;Stoned&quot; - one of the more electronic songs on the album, sounds a lot like a Faithless song (Faithless is a group that Dido is in from time to time that is headed by her producer and brother, Rollo).  I didn't really like it that much on first listen, but it has grown on me - 8/10<br />3) &quot;Life for Rent&quot; - the title track and one of the better songs on the album, another great hook - 10/10<br />4) &quot;Mary's in India&quot; - a weird song, it has grown on me somewhat, somewhat acoustic - 7/10<br />5) &quot;See You When You're 40&quot; - another song that sounds like a Faithless song; okay but nothing special - 8/10<br />6) &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot; - My favorite song on this album!  Everything about is great - the lyrics, the instrumentation, Dido's singing, worth the price of the CD alone here - 11/10<br />7) &quot;Who Makes You Feel&quot; - interesting song, has a nice vibe to it - 9/10<br />8) &quot;Sand in my Shoes&quot; - I love the way Dido sings this song; reminds me a lot of &quot;Take my Hand&quot; from &quot;No Angel&quot; - 10/10<br />9) &quot;Do You Have a Little Time&quot; - this song is another weird one with the strings at the beginning and then the chorus has this weird synthesizer part to it - 7/10<br />10) &quot;This Land Is Mine&quot; - one of the few *true* acoustic sounding songs on this album, it is one of the better ones on the album - 10/10<br />11) &quot;See the Sun&quot; - Great way to end the album; perfect blend of voice with instrumentation, this really makes the song a good one - 10/10<br />The hidden track is alright, nothing special.  It is more of an acoustic track, but a decent song.<br />Overall, you have to give this album a chance.  I remember with &quot;No Angel&quot; that the first time I listened to it, I only liked like 3 songs (&quot;Here With Me&quot;, &quot;Thank You&quot;, &quot;Don't Think of Me&quot;).  However, the more I listened to it, the more I liked all the songs.  It may take longer with &quot;Life for Rent&quot;, but it is a solid album in its own right.  It is also better than anything else that is on the radio.  One of the best albums of 2003.  If you liked &quot;No Angel&quot;, you will enjoy &quot;Life for Rent&quot;.  Just don't write it off after one listen.
B0000CABJ1|4.0|Well, to begin, I must say that I am a biased Donna Summer fan, and have been for the better part of 25 years. That is why I am hard-pressed to give this CD only 4 stars instead of 5. But, there are two major flaws in this release. The first is that one of the new tracks (&quot;Dream-A-Lots Theme...I Will Live For Love&quot;), is a Mouseketeer anthem, very much in the same vein that &quot;Someday&quot; was for the Mouse House CD back in '96. It is very cookie-cutter, dance fodder in it's original version. In my opinion, this is something that Donna should steer away from at least from a production aspect. The second flaw (though hair-splitting it may seem), is that this summer's best dance floor anthem, &quot;You're So Beautiful&quot; was left off the CD's cover credits. Having gotten that out of the way, these remastered classics are as clear as a bell! And the collection, though I personally find some of her greatest songs missing, is a SUPER BUY for the casual Donna fan. <br />Now, onto the really great news about this CD. The remix of &quot;I Will Live For Love&quot; is a fantastic dance tune that should have everyone hitting the dance floor over and over at least through the Christmas holidays. But, the show-stopper is the cool and breezy &quot;That's The Way&quot;. Her throaty and teasingly optimistic vocals just make me shiver with anticipation to replay the song (and to hear an entire CD with Giorgio Moroder).<br />So Donna, I can't give you 5 stars this outing, but hopefully 4 will do for you and the rest of the listening world...
B00003CXB4|5.0|I first saw this movie during its initial theatrical release when I was very young. Even at that young age, I could get so much out of it. I still consider it to be one of my favorite films of all time. The animation is superb and the music is wonderfully orchestrated. Songs are catchy and well written. The story is extremely moving. Loosely based on Shakespeare's Hamlet, the story tells of Simba, the appropriate heir to his father's throne as lion king. When his father is murdered, however, Simba runs away, refusing to accept his responsibility. He grows up in isolation, along with his newfound friends, Timon and Pumba (certainly two of the most likable characters in any animated film). The story has a lot to say about accepting responsibility, and discovering your own identity. It also talks about standing up for what you believe in, and doing your best to make the world a better place. These are themes that anyone can relate to, regardless of age. It's a bit darker then most Disney films, but it also is the most meaningful. It should be introduced to generations of young people for many years to come.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I think that not putting Seinfeld on dvd is rediculous because its such a great show and for some reason all other shows that have some success get released or advertised on dvd the next month, If they are going to put \\"Malcolm in the middle\\" on dvd they oughto put seinfeld because it is possibly the greatest show on ever, and malcolom in the middle is just like ehh.. so lets see how the greatest show gets rewarded
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie is the perfect example of everything that is going on in Chicago in the 20s'.  The streets are booming with murders and jazz.  All characters are portrayed beautifully by Renne Zellweger, Cathrine Zita-Jones, Queen Latifah, and Richard Gere.  You will be singing along with these songs in the shower in no time!
B000092ZYX|1.0|Former Radiohead fan here.  Each of their last three albums have grown progressively worse.  This is the biggest clunker of all.  They are a mere shadow of the great band they once were.  In trying to break new ground they have completely alienated their fan base.  Its really too bad...their early work is the stuff of rock legend.  They were on the path to be one of the greatest rock acts in history.  Now they will be footnoted as an imploded band that could have been.<br />Here lies Radiohead.  R.I.P.

0743455967|5.0|We all want to write like King, don't we? Statistics show that 1/550 of every person in the USA either writes or wants to write for a living. That's a huge amount of fledgling writers out there, and this book shows exactly how one of them came to be.<br />The book, written with King's lighthearted collaquialism, charts his development into a world-famous author. He, like many others, started most modestly, in a tiny 4-room apartment with much love but little food. For those looking for a deep, serious FAQ on writing, look somewhere else. But this semi-autobiography will delight King fans and envigorate aspiring authors. <br />The points King emphasises are extremely simple, stamping down the general rule on action verbs and terrible adverbs. King even slams television as a hazardous-plague for writing. It is basically an unpretentious collage of a famous writer's thoughts and opinions.<br />The book itself reads like a novel, light and sweet on the palate. Anyone who wants to pass a dreary sunday, or wants to gain literary knowledge, can look to this book.  <br />Lavaix
B000094DUP|5.0|I don't watch Neighbours and I probably never will do - the only soap that's good enough for me is Coronation Street! I couldn't tell you any of the characters that are in Neighbours, but I could name a few that have left it and gone on to become big stars of the music world. Kylie Minogue and Natalie Imbruglia are easily the two biggest, but someone called Delta Goodrem could join these two in time. When I heard her debut single, \\"Born To Try,\\" for the first time I didn't take much notice, and likewise with the second single \\"Lost Without You.\\" However, it was the third single to be released from this debut album, the self-titled \\"Innocent Eyes,\\" that really caught my ear.<br /><br />I decided to buy this album straight away with no doubts after reading such fantastic reviews, and I have to say I am very happy. This is a very good debut album. It's easy on the ears and heaving on the relation. Delta Goodrem displays a wonderful quality about herself that makes her shine brighter than say Holly Valance, because she actually can sing! She has a stunning vocal range, has some great melodies, fabulous production, some decent lyrics, and to top it all off she is a very sexy young woman.<br /><br />Innocent Eyes opens with Delta's debut single \\"Born To Try.\\" This song is a wonderful ballad where Delta really gets to showcase her wonderful vocals. The song was a UK Top 3 hit earlier in 2003 and was an Australian No.1 single. Next is \\"Innocent Eyes,\\" Delta's third single and also her third Australian No.1 hit. The song is a very catchy up-tempo track about fond memories of a sparkling childhood. Delta's voice is amazing, and her piano skills are exceptional. \\"Not Me, Not I\\" is the fourth single to be taken from this album, and became Delta's fourth consecutive Australian No.1 single - she's even snatched that title from Kylie, who held the record for three Australian No.1 singles from her self-titled debut back in 1988! \\"Throw It Away\\" is a wonderful mid-tempo song, and a breath of fresh air with the breezy guitar that infects the song and gives it that catchy hook. The vocals are arranged in a similar fashion, and it's just a fantastic feel-good pop song. Very simplistic.<br /><br />\\"Lost Without You\\" landed inside the UK Top 5 this summer and became Delta's second No.1 single in her native Australia. \\"Predictable\\" is one of the album's highlights, because it's so different to anything on the album. A wonderful piano intro opens the song, which breaks out after into a wonderful verse where Delta's vocals are very strong. The chorus then blows up and a storming electric guitar kicks in and rules the song. \\"Butterfly\\" is probably my favourite ballad on the album. Delta devotes her life to her lover, by telling him he's a butterfly who takes off in flight and becomes something so amazing. The message is full of love, and Delta's vocals are phenomenal. \\"In My Own Time\\" is another wonderful mid-tempo song where Delta sings about taking her life slowly and not rushing into anything too drastic. It's a wonderful song and her vocals are filled with emotion.<br /><br />\\"My Big Mistake\\" is a fantastic up-tempo song about a failed love. At first, I though it would sound like the Natalie Imbruglia hit called from 1998 called \\"Big Mistake,\\" but it isn't. This song isn't as good as Imbruglia's but it's still good! \\"This Is Not Me\\" is a bit of a weak song, where Delta's vocals seem a bit off. \\"Running Away\\" is a fantastic and catchy pop song about, funnily enough, running away! Delta's vocals are very good on this song, and she does a good job of singing fast. \\"A Year Ago Today\\" is yet another ballad. As you're reading this review, you're probably thinking that there are too many ballads on the album, but there aren't. Okay, there are a lot of ballads but you'll never get sick of them because they're so good - no filler here! \\"Longer\\" and \\"Will You Fall Me\\" are the final two songs on the album, are a bit disappointing. Delta's vocals are better than ever on these fantastic ballads, but the songs lack anything to keep your interest.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />If you haven't heard of Delta Goodrem yet then you must have been living under a rock for the past year! I urge anyone who is a fan of someone like Mariah Carey or Kylie Minogue to buy this album. It's great for the girls because you can look up to her and sing along to the songs, and for the guys it's good because they can drool over her! That's what is great about Delta; she will appeal to a wide audience. Girls, boys, gays, grannies, babies, mums and many more!

In a mere year and a half, it will be 20 years since this magnetic, marvelous and altogether unique movie was released. What does this call for? A re-release into the theatres with extended footage. No remakes, you need to honor this classic movie by releasing it into theaters. I will be there with bells, as I'm sure many other fans of this wonderful movie will be. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO THIS FOR US!!!
B00003CXD5|4.0|Everything about this package is excellent. The only qualm, it's not a widescreen edition. Movies like this are made to be viewed in widescreen format with the complete director's framing (hence, only  4 stars out of 5). Still, it's  one of the classics necessary to support a collection.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Some good songs, a few so-so songs.  Kind of reminds me of the Piece of Mind and Powerslave album but with less gallop.  What else is there to say?  DoD is a really good tune, epic.  The record is worth a listen.
B00009MGGI|5.0|This is an irresistible series, propelled forward by the exquisite winking-at-the-camera performance of Ian Richardson. Francis Urquhart provides a once-in-a-lifetime role for Richardson and he, exceptional actor that he is, makes the very most of it.<br /><br />In fact, he makes a truly evil character so attractive that you find yourself rooting for him against your better instincts. At least, that's true for the first episode, before the extent of his monstrous nature becomes apparent. One gets entirely caught up in the behind-the-scenes machinations of this man-who-would-be-prime-minister.<br /><br />The tone set by the first episode's shocking finish continues in \\"To Play the King,\\" a fine and exciting sequel. Francis Urquhart (his initials are used to comic effect in the drama's newspaper headlines) goes head-to-head with the King, obviously modeled on Prince Charles.<br /><br />The DVD for this installment has a bonus: An interview with writer Andrew Davies on the BBC. Judging by this segment, British talk show audiences aren't much higher on the IQ scale than their U.S. equivalents. Much of the audience is hostile to Davies -- who did extremely good work here (as he did on his more popular \\"Pride and Prejudice\\") -- because they entirely miss the show's ironic stance. It's great to have this extra feature, although a commentary track with Davies or Richardson (or both) would have been even better.<br /><br />Finally, the trilogy ends with \\"The Final Cut.\\" The tone really shifts in this one, and I have to say it's the least successful installment. Richardson no longer seems to be enjoying himself as much, although perhaps it's just that he's portraying a much more tired Urquhart. The pace is slower, the suspense is a bit more contrived, and the new characters are less interesting. Still, it succeeds in bringing the series to a suitably dramatic close.<br /><br />If you're a fan of British drama or politics (or great acting, for that matter), don't hesitate. Snatch up this DVD set.tch up this DVD set.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|I was looking forward to this new studio release for a long time from the great Iron Maiden, and was really disappointed. After the  superb previous cd \\"Brave New World', this comes as a real anti-climax. I expected a much stronger effort from such seasoned musicians. Some of the tracks sound like poor rehashes from 'Brave New World', rather like ones that did not quite make it. Whilst listening to the title track, I thought I was listening to 'Blood Brother' from 'Brave New World'<br />Another gripe I have is this...How can you have 3 lead guitarists in the line up, and sound so tepid? The guitarists should be fighting for their spot in the limelight. Instead it sounds to me like they are just coasting along.<br />Overall it is not a bad cd, but it does not come close to any of their other studio releases in my opinion. Iron Maiden have some superb albums and this one does not compete. I cannot find a single stand out track. Even their average albums like 'No prayer For The Dying' have several superb stand out tracks. Why, even the 2 albums with Blaze Bayley on vocals have some excellent stand out tracks!  Guess I will have to wait several years for the next album.<br />All in all I find it a very uninspired album.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Johnny Cash still has that baritone voice. It isn't as powerful as it once was but this album suits him to a T. Most of the songs will tug your heart knowing this was his last work and it almost seems prophetic. The title song gave me goosebumps.

B0000CD5I6|5.0|Ever since Songs From The Wood there has been something about the music of Jethro Tull that has more often than not felt akin to the moods and sentimentality of the winter holidays. In fact I have always wondered why a Jethro Tull Christmas Album hadn't happened before now, although in retrospect I am thankful it didn't. While I have always enjoyed Ian Anderson's singing, even through some of the rougher moments of recent years, it has been reemerging again of late into the voice of old over the past couple years and with this release it can be safely stated that he has regained that voice back in full throttle and then some. And while the singing has never been better it's equally matched by the skill of the musicians and the quality of the music, all of which is classic Tull dressed up in a Kris Kringle costume. Listening to this disc you can almost smell the pine and feel the warmth of a fire crackling while outside the snow gently covers the ground in a white blanket on the eve of that one particular December eve. <BR>Do I rave because I'm a Jethro Tull fan and therefore apt to like whatever is released under that moniker? <BR>To some degree perhaps I do. Although I can say that there are a couple--not many--but a couple of releases by Jethro Tull that I'm not exceptionally fond of, so I don't tend to praise simply because it wears the name \\"Jethro Tull\\" on the cover. And then again pretty much anyone reading these reviews are probably already Jethro Tull fans anyway so my slant here isn't to say that you should buy it because the music is great, because if you already enjoy the Tull you probably already know that this is going to be of that same high quality style of musicality that we've grown to love and expect over the years. If it was something radically different you would get comments like, \\" It's another Under Wraps\\" or something. <BR>Nowadays I think what most people want to know about a Jethro Tull record is, how is the singing voice and does the musicrock? <BR>Well, the answer to the first question I have already given. Ian sounds like he has given his voice a shot of Viagra. It's fantastic. <BR>Does it rock? Well, not in the vein of say Aqualung or Locomotive Breath, but then it is a Christmas record and it tends to keep to a mood best suited to that genre, although the lead track does rock the sled pretty good. Musically it is similar to what you would expect from Ian on the heels of Rupi's Dance.   <BR>If you're already a fan of Jethro Tull and their style of music to begin with then you will almost certainly love this record. The only other question I can think of right now that some fan reading this might want to ask about this Tull recording before committing to buying it is does it play well beyond the confines of a Christmas record?<BR>All I can say is that is not only is this one of the best Christmas albums out there, it is also one of the best recordings by Jethro Tull, period.
0790729644|5.0|That's how I would describe &quot;Unforgiven&quot; -- as hard as the title implies. It's a classic, no doubt, every bit as good as Eastwood's other great film, &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales,&quot; maybe a little better.<br />It's taken me years to fully appreciate the power and accomplishment of this movie. Eastwood himself refused to make it until after he'd reached a certain age, and it takes a certain level of maturity to accept that this movie HAS NO HEROES, that it is about death and dying, that it is about a way of life that has long vanished ... a way that, in the hardboiled view of this movie, wasn't all that great to begin with.<br />&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is one of the few successful films that has no sympathetic characters. Eastwood's William Munny is a criminal, a thug whose late-in-life recognition of his own dastardly deeds does not necessarily clear him of them (hence the title). His buddy, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) is no saint either, simply too old and guilt-ridden to live the outlaw life any longer. Likewise, the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett, and whatever happened to him?) is the cowboy equivalent of a punk, a gangsta wannabe with more mouth than guts (he's the only character in the movie to experience a moral revelation).<br />Which brings us to the &quot;bad guy,&quot; Little Bill Daggett, played with clear-eyed hate by Gene Hackman. What a complex character. The guy just wants to build a house and watch the sunset over his coffee. He can't hammer two nails into a board. He wants law and order in his frontier town, and he'll get it if he has to beat a man to death. He's cowardly -- once he's disarmed a man and surrounded him with trigger-happy &quot;deputies,&quot; then he lets fly with his fists -- but maybe he's just playing a dangerous game the smart way. And he is smart. Smarter than Will Munny, only not quite as lucky.<br />Let us not forget the prostitutes who set the plot in motion. Strawberry Alice seems to desire bloody revenge far morethan Delilah, the girl whose face is slashed by the cowboys. All of the women in the film are hard, brutal, deceptive, obsessed with avenging themselves of the very livelihood that pays the bounty. Not a likeable or sympathetic character in the bunch.<br />Finally, there's English Bob (Richard Harris). Eastwood establishes that he's come to Big Whiskey for the bounty so subtly that, believe it or not, I missed it the first time I saw the movie. (Maybe it's a little too subtle -- no dialogue refers to his motivation.) English Bob gits the tar whupped out of him, but he's not a good guy, just a &quot;living legend&quot; whose legend has finally caught up with him.<br />There is a journey in the movie, but it's an anti-heroic journey with only one outcome: that Will Munny will actually lose his battle with his demons and commit murder in exchange for filthy lucre. (The character's name is not a coincidence.) Not exactly a healthy outlook on the human condition.<br />&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is what certain critics mean when they describe a movie as &quot;dark,&quot; only here the description actually applies. It is dark, and it does not contain a glimmer of hope for anything or anyone. &quot;Deserve's got nothing to do with it,&quot; Munny tells Little Bill. And yet everybody in the movie gets exactly what they deserve ... including Will Munny, who's left alone with the demons of his past.<br />The movie is great precisely because of its pessimism; I don't know another way to put it. It is the death of the Western; it is also sad and moving, physically beautiful and vividly acted. Ten years ago, I sorta kinda felt &quot;Unforgiven&quot; didn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar. Now I sorta kinda feel that it's too good for it.
B00009RDG9|1.0|This movie is a weird shaped animal. I was trying to decipher it's geography in much the same way if you were to blindfold yourself and were thus forced to eat strange wriggly bits and such and were asked to guess the bits' identity.<BR>I guess that's a roundabout way of saying how the pacing was really ungainly and awkward.<br />Anyhow let's get to the good stuff:<br />The first opening battle scenes looked terribly fake. It was obviously filmed inside a studio. I don't know why it seemed fake. The way the people were dying was really fake. They flayed themselves about in an overly dramatic cartoon kind of way. And I guess it looked terribly busy in terms of the amount of \\"authentic\\" detail was being pushed up against your eyeballs. The darkness and the all smoke and explosions looked overly done as well. <br />Onto the rest of the movie:<BR>The lovely wilderness scenes of the forests in BC and Oregon are absolutely gorgeous, and I wouldn't have minded if the rest of the movie was filmed in such locales but alas the director thought it necessary for us to switch to an urban setting for a better part of the filming. His mistake. Who cares about the city!?<br />The female FBI agent was the most unconvincing female FBI agent I have ever beheld! Her spindly little arms, too pretty face, and spindly long legs all looked more suited for the cat walk instead of the physical rigours of an FBI job. Look, Gillian Anderson of X Files fame makes a more convincing FBI agent due to her beautiful natural real people looks and the natural authority in her demeanor and face instead of the sad limpy so-called commanding prescence of our skinny glamour-puss FBI agent in this movie. I could not help but laugh whenever she squeaked out some order.<BR>I was afraid her spider-like arms could not hold up her little gun. What an ill choice!<br />I thought it was equally revolting that we had the incredibly unnecessary interlude with Del Toro's lady friend and the lady friend's daughter. BTW, I really wanted to kick the little girl due to her cardboard saccharine sweetness. It was so FAKE! STOP IT! ACT LIKE A REAL GIRL! Real girls bite and kick and muck about. They are not all happiness and sunshine!<br />The training scenes were intriguing, but at times resembled a bizarre Broadway chorus line with the constant slightly funny excercises and such.<br />Yes, Del Toro's motivation were opaque at best. They hinted here and there, but in the end I was worked up into a fit of sleep.<br />The only good thing was the understated acting of Tommy Lee Jones. I guess he took the job to pay for that house in Tahiti. We could only be so lucky.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|Well the title pretty much said it all. I just got it and it's definitely their best. I like The State and Silver Side Up as well, but this is the stuff! Go get it now! And I agree with a previous reviewer about the people giving it only one or two stars- Please put down the pipe!
630512762X|3.0|This was a terribly interesting movie, but it was also the first movie that managed to erase every coherent intelligent thought from my brain. That said, I am sure you can find reviews and summaries for this movie from any of the numerous reviews litering this page, but one must not forget to have a handy book on differential equations, your driver's license, and a napkin to wipe the drool from the corner of your lips close by. OKAY?
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Wow!!!! I don't know how anyone can sit through this with a dry eye!! Stunning, heartfelt performances by George's buddies. Jeff Lynne's sound mix was awesome!! The interviews with Eric, Tom Petty and others really shed light on the love for the man we all miss. George created the original benefit concert and it is only fitting that everyone came together on the anniversary of his death to pay tribute. Now I will wait patiently until the DVD release in November. <br />Long live George!
B00005JLZN|1.0|An innocent man is executed for the murder he did not commit. The crucial evidence for his innocence arrives five minutes after he is put to death. And everybody suffers: the victim, the man, and the viewers. Bad movie from an acclaimed director. Makes an excellent gift to the governor of Texas.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Simply put, Pink Floyd's 1973 DSOTM is a classic. Not only was it on the billboards 200 for 11 YEARS, it also sold 34 million copies.  Now i know that the amount of copies a cd sold does not determine how good it is.  Heck, BSB prob sold have this amount yet made a crap CD.  Listen to the cd from the beginning heart beats to the ending heart beats you will know what i am talking about.

0913866156|5.0|I didn't purchase this through Amazon, but from a small mystical shop in Fayetteville, Arkansas when I was eighteen, and it was not me that purchased it but my mom who purchased it for me as a Christmas gift.  It was my first Tarot cards and I took it everywhere with me all over the country.  Now 12 years later, I'm still using them (having purchased several different Tarot cards) because I get so much out of the reading as compared to others.  I think it does not matter whether you are a novice or an expert at Tarot reading, but it is a great Tarot system that you could grow up with.  It's my opinion that no Tarot reader should be without the Thoth cards in their collection.
B0000A7W14|5.0|Amidst the usual droll that passes for the &quot;gangsta&quot; genre, this movie shines like a sheer gem of movie making.<br />A stunning, gripping, touching drama set in the real streets of LA. Veers around the tensions of inter-city culture, and what it's like to be an African-American youth growing up in South Central Los Angeles. Gut-wrenching potrayal of a hard-hitting theme as it is, the movie also sports a bevy of great names: Lawrence Fishburne, Cuba Gooding Jr, Angela Bassett, Ice Cube.<br />I was hooked from Minute 1. Unembellished story line. Most of all an important message you can't possibly ignore, unless you watch it with your eyes closed. Which will anyway open when you see the ending of this stunning film.<br />A must see -- there is a reason why the DVD is priced a bit steep. I would've bought it even if it was 10 bucks more.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|Scarface, the 1983 action-drama starring Al Pacino as a Cuban refugee is one hell of a movie.  Though dealing with much controversy, Brian DePalma makes a striking movie here.  Al Pacino plays Tony Montana, a druglord who is involved in the business and gets involved in a deadly trap and soon becomes a target.  The plot is isn't incomprehensible nor it is disposable.  It's an intitially intriguing film at the look of the drug business and how it can cause so much havoc and ruin a man's life.  Based on the old 1932 film made by Howard Hawks, there is a huge difference between them.  Scarface also features nice supporting roles from Michelle Pfeiffer, George Bauer, Robert Loggia as well as a few others.  <BR>     Director Brian DePalma depicts much realism with quite a bit of over-the-top violence, including a chain saw scene (only blood is shown), a hanging from a helicopter but mainly fatal and bloody gunplay as well as excessive profanity, to be more specific the use of one particular word starting with an &quot;f.&quot;  Though the film has an &quot;R&quot; rating, at first it was rated &quot;X.&quot;  You may not realize it, but much devotion and hard work was put into making this film.  Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay, easy to say why it was controversial now.<BR>       The new DVD edition features some nice behind-the-scenes footage, mainly 3 documenataries on the acting, creating and rebirth of the film.  All featuring interviews with cast and crew.  Though if you viewed the film recently, it may not seem as over-the-top now as it did back in 1983.  Scarface is worth owning on Video or DVD.  Note: Not a film for young audiences.

B00006AG5N|5.0|I picked up this album the day it was released and even though I already have some of the songs on other albums in my Elvis collection, it was still well worth it.  This is an entertainer who had charisma with a capital &quot;C&quot; and it showed in all of his live performances.  Whether you're a long-time Elvis fan or if you're just getting to like him thanks to the JXL re-mix of &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot;, this is a must-have for any music collection.  Pick it up A.S.A.P.!<br />And just on a personal note from a tried and true Elvis fan.  It's one thing not to appreciate Elvis' music.  I know not everyone on this planet enjoys the music of the King of Rock 'N' Roll and criticism is to be expected.  If everyone liked the same things, ate the same food and dressed the same way this would be a pretty boring place.  <br />On the other hand, and this is strictly for Bix (the ignorant, brainless turkey that he happens to be).  I have never seen anyone sink so low in an attempt to defame one of the greatest entertainers of the 20th century.  The fact of the matter is your points are so way off the mark, it's incredibly laughable.  Get your facts straight before you go and shoot your mouth off and then keep 'em to yourself because no one cares to hear what  you have to say.
B00006DEF9|5.0|When SINGING IN THE RAIN was released, people were certain it was Oscar material. AN AMERICAN IN PARIS had won the previous year, and certainly this was a more spectacular film. It did not win the Oscar that year. Cecil B. De Mille's THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH won the honor. The academy preferred Betty Hutton, Charlton Heston, James Stewart as a clown escaping the police, and the great train wreck scene of this film over the song and dance numbers of Gene Kelley, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor. Over the years audiences seem to love this film, which is often considered the greatest Hollywood musical, or at least the greatest MGM musical, and are probably more familiar with it than the Academy Award Winner.<br />I remember the first time I saw SINGING IN THE RAIN. It was pre-cable, on a rainy Sunday afternoon, when I was in the sixth grade. With nothing better to do, I watched this movie and was mesmerized. Even though I had seen THE WIZARD OF OZ many times, and even got to stay up late and watch THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, I had never seen a movie quite like this one. Though I will have to admit THE SOUND OF MUSIC  is my favorite movie musical, SINGING IN THE RAIN  got me addicted to film.<br />The reason this film has lasting value is that it works. We genuinely like the characters so we hope they fall in love. The musical numbers, though not originally written for the film, fit together. The dancing can transport the viewer to another time and place. Though the plot may be simplistic, it is sincere entertainment. We see three great performers, perhaps at their best (though I would argue that Kelley is slightly, but just slightly better in AMERICAN IN PARIS) in a film that could never be duplicated today.<br />The two disk DVD set has an added bonus of a second disk containing a history of MGM musicals produced by Arthur Freed. This historical piece which includes snippets of other MGM greats such as SHOWBOAT, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, THE HARVEY GIRLS, THE WIZARD OF OZ, and GIGI is definitely a treat.Z, and GIGI is definitely a treat.
B000002UZ1|5.0|It's truly hard to believe that The Beatles crammed this much creative activity into a three year period. One could argue that song selection on \\"1967-1970\\" should have started with the \\"Revolver\\" album, which was a glimpse into the forthcoming \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\" But what a glorious period it still was without those songs. Beginning with the pocket symphony (to borrow Brian Wilson's phrase) of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" it just seems like the exploratory range of Lennon/McCartney's songwriting was boundless. They grabbed critics by their lapels and shook them till their stuffiness came loose, and screamed at them till the artistry of popular music was recognized. The entire first disc still sounds amazing after more than 3 decades.<br />On disc two was when The Beatles began to splinter and it starts showing. Fortunately the individual efforts were often just as brilliant as the band's. George Harrison in particular, with both his \\"Something\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" here. They also wanted to show that they could still rock as hard as any of their contemporaries (\\"Back In The USSR\\"). And even as they were collapsing, they still bowed out with two of the most amazing songs ever written, \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road.\\" As far as a primer for a young listener or a solid but quick fix for the older Beatles fan, 1967-1970 opens the window for timeless music.
0060537639|2.0|First, let's dispense with the obvious; this is largely a work of fiction. The hunches are just that and the evidence is circumstanial at best. I understand that Menzies believes that most of his potential &quot;proof&quot; was destroyed ages ago by the Chinese themselves. That doesn't prove his theory.<br /> In the most ridiculous accumulation of circumstanial evidence this side of Chariots of the Gods (Van Dankien's absurd premise at the heart of God is as follows;how could humans have built the pyramids--we're just not smart enough! Yet we came up with physics, mathematics, art, literature. All of that must of come from aliens from outer space as well), Menzies claims that the Chinese sailed virtually around the world. I have no doubt that the Chinese played more of a cultural role than previously attributed and believe that Menzies theory is fascinating but he lacks proof. Like Edward Hooper's book on the AIDS epidemic The River, Menzies began with his theory first and then sought out proof afterwards. That's not to say that Menzies' ideas don't have merit or that they don't merit serious discussion (or a more detailed book for that matter). Menzies proof is sketchy at best. Sure there is compelling evidence that suggests that the Chinese ventured far outside the waters of their continent but that doesn't prove that they discover the Americas or that Columbus knew about the Americas prior to sailing himself.<br />Many of Menzies ideas certainly would merit a more critical and objective book. 1421 isn't bad but it's an example of the National Enquirer world we live in; suggest a theory and then use sketchy information to support it. After all, most folks will never know and those less informed than Menzies will never suspect when his proof has been slanted to prove his theories. As it is, 1421 is no better than a fictional historical novel; while there are many bits of truth in it, there's also a whole lot of fiction.
B000002UYZ|5.0|In just four short years, The Beatles completely turned the world of music on its head. We all know that part. But even with the mere 26 songs on &quot;1962-1966,&quot; it's hard to conceive of this much youthful energy consistently formulating such timeless brilliance. As primitive as some of the early singles may sound after forty years, you can't argue that they still leap from the speakers and demand that you jump up and pay attention.<br />Within two years, The Beatles were already experimenting with sounds and structures (that gripping single chord that opens &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;; the feedback that slices into the beginning of &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;) in a fashion that all but dared anyone else to not take up their lead. Then, all of a sudden, there's &quot;Yesterday.&quot; How could these so-called &quot;mop-tops&quot; ever come up with a song so emotionally powerful?<br />Disc two makes the case for The Beatles' burgeoning influx of psychedelia. &quot;Help!&quot; was John Lennon suddenly performing songs that had lyrics for grown-ups. George Harrison discovered the sitar (&quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;). And with &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; they began to display a range of topics that moved far away from interpersonal boy meets girl love sings and into the world of characters that inhabited an outside world. It was just a half step from the church of Father Mackenzie to Billy Shears' and his band.<br />There will always be those that bicker over which songs would have suited this set better. Frankly, the individual albums are more than capable of supplying any number of different personal favorites on a given day. As for a real juicy snack of amazing music, I'm happy to have &quot;1962-1966&quot; here to put in my player.

B00005JKNF|5.0|I watched this movie approximately 7 times within a week and loved it.  It is true, you have to view the movie more than once to pick up on all the whispered asides and secret alliances and also watching the DVD with the English subtitles feature on, however, would probably resolve the issue of accents and dialogue.  A fast moving film that is as fascinating below stairs as above and gives us a glimpse of a useless monied class and and a class for whom being &quot;in service&quot; was a source of pride. Whether servant/master, slave/master, worker/master, the two will never be inseparable or how else can either exist?
0316921173|5.0|This novel is something else. I think part of why everyone who finishes it loves it is just simple pride at having gotten through it all. There are footnotes with multiple chapters! In the end the book just overwhelms you by sheer force. True, it raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer; but I'm willing to call that 'negative capability' and declre it a good thing.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I saw this film today ( 10\03\2003). I've seen a lot of concert films in my life and this is the best one hands down!<BR>To see McCartney and Clapton harmonizing was worth the price of admission. Usually in tribute concerts, there's one or two mediocre performances. NOT HERE. Every song is a gem. I only hope they release a CD of this. It's SOMETHING I can listen to over and over. I look forward to buying this even more than The Beatles On Ed Sullivan. George must be smiling!
078311513X|4.0|Definitly a shocker and worth a look or two, The Hitcher shines as one of the most thrilling and suspenseful of all stranger-from-hell cinema. The part where the finger is in the food is very disturbing and ingenious, and the part where Jennifer Jason Leigh is tied between the two vehicles is another bone-chilling experience. I just felt it would have been better to have not exactly seen so much of the title villain. In the recent release of JOY RIDE with Leelee Sobieski and Paul Walker, the villain was very creepy, and especially since the director used a sort of Hitchcockian technique of masking the killer and having us picture what he really looks like...until the end. Overall, The Hitcher is an incredible piece of work with strong performances and cinematography, but a lack of creepiness which it needs.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This band has potential to revolutionize modern rock along with the likes of POD and Linkin Park.  Truly, this album represents a combination of ambient spacial theme transversed into rock and roll.  The result is incredible.  Some of the notable songs are Capricorn (A Brand New Name), Oblivion, and The Mission.  However, all the songs on the album focus on a new style of almost trancelike melodies.  It was as if trance simply coexisted with rock in this band.  I must give them credit because not only do they make it work, but there is no other modern band that can produce such an incredible combination of style.
B00005RHGK|5.0|Jeepers Creepers is one of the most effective, fresh, creepy horror films to come along in the past few years, and I enjoyed it immensely.  You may find some of the elements from this film elsewhere, but Jeepers Creepers really does have its own unique story to tell.  The plot breaks down a little bit in the final half hour, but everything up to that point is simply superb.<br />I love the opening scenes; this really doesn't even seem like a movie for the first half hour.  You have a very typical brother and sister cruising down a deserted road in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the day.  I entered this film with dark aspirations in mind, so the bright, peaceful setting of the opening really grabbed my attention.  It may be a lonely stretch of road, but the setting is one of safety and serenity - until, that is, a character in a super-charged old van tries to wreck the car holding our protagonists.  For Patricia and Darius Jenner (Gina Philips and Justin Long, respectively), this frightening bit of road rage proves to be only the start of a horrible night.  On down the road, the pair catch sight of the evil van parked beside an old, crumbling building; looking closer, they see the driver of the truck tossing a couple of items that certainly look like bodies wrapped in blood-soaked sheets down a big pipe.  The bad guy sees the kids pass by and immediately starts out in pursuit, doing all he can to wreck them.  Darius eventually has the brilliant idea of going back to the pipe to see if anyone is still alive down there, and his much smarter sister cannot talk him out of this notion.  Here marks the upping of the creepiness factor.  There are many significant things to be found in the chamber below; finding a way out, though proves to be a challenge as Darius soon discovers.  Eventually a shell-shocked Darius and Trish make it to a roadside restaurant and call the police.  Things get weirder, though, when an anonymous stranger calls Darius and Trish and explains the things she has been seeing in her visions, warning them that the &quot;thing&quot; will not stop coming after them.  This proves to be quite the understatement.  The Creeper, whoever or whatever he is, is relentless in his pursuit of the scared youngsters, leading to one exciting confrontation after another in a variety of venues.  Things progress quite nicely to an ending that is both good and bad; good in the sense that it does not pull a fairy tale ending out of the hat, but bad in that the final five minutes prove anticlimactic, forced, and generally unsatisfying.<br />Personally, I have to say I wasn't that impressed with the costume and special effects of the Creeper; from a distance, or coiled in shadows, he's pretty intimidating, but his visual effect on the viewer decreases as we see more of him.  Writer/director Victor Salva envisioned this film as his own &quot;monster movie,&quot; but I think that a more human boogeyman would have served this story more effectively.  Justin Long has some kind of David Schwimmer thing going on at times, but he is otherwise quite convincing in the role of Darius; he is the one who sees firsthand the handiwork of the Creeper, and the effects of what he has seen are reflected dramatically on his face and spirit.  Gina Philips is fantastic; she may well be the sexiest female on the planet, as well.  More than just a pretty face, the depth of her commitment and talent are demonstrated quite convincingly in the six featurettes on the making of the movie.  These featurettes, by the way, are quite good.  The deleted and extended scenes housed on the DVD, though, aren't that impressive; for the life of me, I could hardly find the difference between the alternate and final versions of a few scenes in the movie.<br />Jeepers Creepers is just a terrific, vastly underrated horror film.  Relying more on suspense than blood and gore (although there is a certain amount of gore to be found here), this would make an especially good introduction to the genre for those yet to dip their feet into the deep, dark side of the entertainment pool.troduction to the genre for those yet to dip their feet into the deep, dark side of the entertainment pool.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|The ambient studio collective known as Enigma have returned with their fifth studio album, &quot;Voyageur,&quot; and, in my opinion, this is their best album since their classic debut, &quot;MCMXC A.D.&quot;, 13 years ago. For &quot;Voyageur,&quot; group mastermind Michael Cretu said that he wanted Enigma to branch out a bit, so this is the first Enigma album to contain absolutely no samples, i.e. no gregorian chants, no Orff operas, etc., etc. (although Cretu does allow the group's signature horn intro that kicks off every Enigma album). This time, it's all original sounds, but if you think that Enigma have totally re-written their musical book with their 2003 offering, you needn't worry. Just like their first four albums, &quot;Voyageur&quot; is a glowing, hypnotic Enigma disc with great beats, lush keyboards &amp; arrangements, seductive vocal performances (by Cretu, wife Sandra Cretu, Ruth-Ann from Olive, and Andru Donalds), and dreamy atmosphere. Great, catchy, luscious tracks from start to finish, including &quot;Incognito,&quot; &quot;Page Of Cups,&quot; &quot;Boum-Boum,&quot; &quot;Look Of Today&quot; (with it's clever nod to the old ABC hit, &quot;Look Of Love&quot;), the awesome &quot;In The Shadow, In The Light&quot; (arguably the album's best track), the lovely &quot;The Piano,&quot; and &quot;Following The Sun.&quot; It's always a pleasure to hear new music from Michael Cretu &amp; company---Enigma's &quot;Voyageur&quot; is simply fantastic.
B00005JKED|4.0|The plot may sound woefully overdone- You could even reduce it to good cop, bad cop. Rookie- Veteran. Crooked- Straight laced. I am black, you are white...-SNL. Streetwise, squeaky clean. But really just summing it up like that is an injustice to the movie. Yeah, it IS that set up. It HAS been done to death. But...It's probably never been done better. Denzel doesn't phone it in. It turns into a real head trip actually with his character and Ethan Hawk's. I don't really like Hawk. Never did. He's good in this though. You can see his character going through the roller coaster ride. First he thinks, he's just the new guy and he's just got to give Denzel the benefit of the doubt, then he thinks he's wrong and Denzel's crooked, then he thinks Washington's just flawed but still a just and righteous man at heart...back and forth, back and forth. This movie works. Even if the plot line seems like a big wallop of a cliche. I'll put it this way... If you have to see just one of ''those movies'', this is probably the best one you'll ever see. I stayed up all night to watch this on HBO when I was already up later than I should've been, even though I knew I had to go to work the next day. It is one of those kind of movies. I just kept wondering whether Washington's character was going to be redeemable or end up still questionable or what?! That is the effect this has on people, even after Washington does some things that are really wicked, you still wonder what's in his heart.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer simply made the best metal album of the 80's when the released Reign In Blood.  Don't get me wrong when I write this, Master of Puppets is an undeniable classic too, but this album edges out Metallica simply for the fact that Slayer always stuck to their guns and did what was best for their sound.  They never released an album that topped this, but then again Metallica really didn't either.  Angel of Death through Raining Blood is simply thrash metal perfection. An album worth checking out if you like extreme music that still has songs and talent in it.
0316666343|1.0|Easy read for theological illiterates. <BR>Nice heaven for nice boys and girls. But where did the not so nice killer go when he died? To a heaven where his dreams are fulfilled? Meaning - where he can kill uncounted little girls? There is no place for hell in this type of theology. Besides - Susie kills her own killer. So now she is a killer herself and does it affect her nice heaven at all? Or are there murderers and murderers? Some of them are just nicer than others and they are permitted to take somebody's life and live the life everlasting in complete happiness. It is no surprise that there is no place for God in this book, because it is peopled by little ghostly deities - the dead who can voluntarily influence the living as they wish. Then the next step is - why not worship them, give them gifts and put out food during the long autumn nights to keep them warm? Trick or treat. It is a very complicated and serious theme where the souls of people are at stake and it should not be treated this way - with the arrogance of paganism.
B00000DGUM|3.0|I've just recently bought this, along with Dokken very best, and I choose to review them at the same time because they have a couple of things in common, some different things, and certainly, different impact on listener. First of all, I have to say that I was a MAJOR fan of Skid Row (i no longer support their updated, Bach-less line-up), so I have all their records and like them all (even if Slave To the Grind remains not only my favorite, but also one of my top 10 favorites altogether). So I HAD to have this compilation. After a week of continuous listening, here are my observations, itemized, of course:<br /><br />-\\"Best of\\" vs \\"Greatest Hits\\": even thought most record label execs are brainless enough not to know the difference between the 2 (other than semantics), the fact remains that both are different: a \\"best of\\" includes the band's favorites, a \\"greatest\\" includes whatever hits they had on the radio. On that regard, \\"40 Seasons\\" lies closer to a greatest hits.<br /><br />-Running order(chronological vs. impact): this compilation is horrible in that respect. Records, whether they are live, studio or compilations, MUST have a running order that grabs the listener by the throat. Dokken's is brilliant! This one is horrible: even if i love \\"Youth Gone Wild\\", it is not an opening song! Not only that, but that song was THE closing song on a nightly basis during the band's career! It is almost blasphemy!! And to follow that with \\"18 and life\\"...c'mon, give me a break! This compilation should have had a random, impact based running order, and \\"My Enemy\\" or \\"Monkey Business\\" should've been the opening songs...<br /><br />-Album representation: it is fairly good, but one question arises: if their debut record was their most successful, how come only 4 songs are included here, while subhuman race, their least successful, has 5 songs?<br />-Subhuman Race: it is fairly obvious to me that the band was unhappy with the way this record turned out. Want proof? None of the songs from that record is included in its original form. Fear not, the remixes are barely noticeable (little twists on guitars and vocals), the live version of \\"Beat yourself blind\\" is great and even the demo version of \\"Frozen\\" is great, quite different from the album version (which i prefer), but good...<br /><br />-Unreleased songs: the real treat for longtime fans! Both are great! I still don't get why they were not included on the original records they were intended for...<br /><br />-Band involvement: another miss!Only Rachel Bolan had any say here, and that is never a good thing, which is an aspect this compilation shares with the Dokken one. There are at least 2 songs here that I have reasonable doubts as to what the heck they are doing here: \\"Psycho Love\\" and \\"Piece of Me\\". Don't get me wrong, as i mentioned before, I love every single piece of music the band ever made, but... where are \\"Riot Act\\" (Skid Row's greatest live song!), \\"Wasted Time\\", \\"In a darkened room\\"? Nowhere to be found,here! Since Rachel was the only band member involved, he overlooked those gems in favor of 2 of his own songs. That IS BLASPHEMY!!!<br /><br />All in all, the compilation does have its moments, and my instincts tell me that it won't be long before Rhino Records graces us with another one of their \\"Essential\\" compilations. Let's just hope they take some of these observations (and I mean the observations of all the other customers/fans who have submitted their reviews) in mind next time...uded in its original form. Fear not, the remixes are barely noticeable (little twists on guitars and vocals), the live version of \\"Beat yourself blind\\" is great and even the demo version of \\"Frozen\\" is great, quite different from the album version (which i prefer), but good...    -Unreleased songs: the real treat for longtime fans! Both are great! I still don't get why they were not included on the original records they were intended for...    -Band involvement: another miss!Only Rachel Bolan had any say here, and that is never a good thing, which is an aspect this compilation shares with the Dokken one. There are at least 2 songs here that I have reasonable doubts as to what the heck they are doing here: \\"Psycho Love\\" and \\"Piece of Me\\".

B000002KBH|5.0|I really wish I could describe this album in it's true essence, without any cliches or platitudes. There's an inexplicably beautiful aura that suffuses throughout this unprecedented recording. Something remarkable and intangible that hits you as soon as Box Of Rain sweetly cascades out of the speakers. For me, this whole album perfectly represents the greatest of feelings. Feelings which can not be defined. Fleeting moments where things are as they should be. American Beauty is like a revisitation of an incredibly joyous moment everytime I hear it. I love this album. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the profound, emotional profusion that only marvelous recordings emit. Everyone should get a chance to cherish and enjoy this delightful record.
B000002VCZ|4.0|1984's &quot;Vulture Culture&quot; finds the Alan Parsons Project simplifying &amp; softening their musical approach. No real traces of the group's earlier progressive rock elements on &quot;Vulture,&quot; and there's a stronger leaning towards pop, with more emphasis on synthesisers and synth drums (and no orchestrations by Andrew Powell, either). But Alan Parsons, songwriting partner Eric Woolfson, and their team of excellent singers (like Woolfson himself, Lenny Zakatek and Colin Blunstone) and studio musicians (like guitarist Ian Bairnson and drummer Stuart Elliott) still know how to craft music that's catchy and great-sounding. In the end, &quot;Vulture Culture&quot; is still a fine Project album. With it's theme about lack of communication, &quot;Vulture&quot; contains some sparkling Project gems, like the strong pop/rock of &quot;Let's Talk About Me,&quot; the incredibly beautiful &quot;Days Are Numbers (The Traveller),&quot; the smooth-sounding title song, and the quirky instrumental, &quot;Hawkeye.&quot; But the rest of the album is equally good.Okay, so if you had to rank all of the Alan Parsons Project's albums, &quot;Vulture Culture&quot; would probably come in last, but that still puts it in good company. &quot;Vulture Culture&quot; is the softest Project album of the bunch, but make no mistake, it's still very good.
B00000JBFW|5.0|Deep Purple is just one of those underrated bands.  Ten years after the Mark II line-up split and eight years after the band ceased to exist entirely, the best line-up reformed.  The time off was necessary, I think.  \\"Perfect Strangers\\" is a gem of the 80s.  It has all of the talent and class of Deep Purple with a matured and evolved style.  The title track explores the emotions that still lingered between bandmates, post-reformation.  Moody and exotic sounding, the song is centrally placed to anchor the album.  It is the spine of this work.  <br />All of the songs, aside for maybe \\"Not Responsible,\\" are well-done and enjoyable.  Of course, my favorite song is \\"Knocking at Your Back Door.\\"  It's sleazy and thoroughly enjoyable.<br />Ending the album is \\"Son of Alerik\\" a long, solely instrumental piece.  Moody, it has a way of conjuring images of somber medieval kings, quite indicative of Blackmore's love of the medieval.<br />All in all, an enjoyable album, perhaps one of their best.
B000002GYR|5.0|This is a great album.  Tom Waits at his earliest and best.  This is the perfect starter for anyone who wants to become a fan of one of the greastest and most orignal songwriters ever.  I highly recomend it. A great driving CD.
B000002LIX|5.0|Ritual De Lo Habitual remains Jane's Addiction's finest hour. This album was released at a time when most rock albums were very straight forward, rarely straying from one type of music. Along with their strong debut album Nothing's Shocking, Jane's Addiction helped change the musical landscape by taking metal, punk, rock, alternative music, and psychedelia and adding violins and piano to create their own sound. The fact that they broke up after this album makes you wonder what limits they would have taken music had they stayed together.<br />The album, perhaps intentionally, features their harder, noisier tracks on the first half while concentrating on longer, very psychedelic tracks on its second half. The harder tracks &quot;No One's Leaving&quot; and &quot;Ain't No Right&quot; are great, highlighted by Eric Avery's excellent bass lines. &quot;Stop!&quot; and &quot;Been Caught Stealing&quot; were the hits off the album and both still sound great today. &quot;Obvious&quot; is also a cool tune with Dave Navarro's noisy guitar playing and the piano flourishes throughout the track. Then there's the second side. &quot;3 Days&quot; remains their best song, beginning with Perry Farrell's quiet vocals over Avery's bass before drummer Stephen Perkins comes in with a jungle beat and Navarro playing a wild solo as the track continues to gather momentum. The track gets very mellow around the 8:00 mark before picking up the intensity at its end. An awesome track. The other psychedelic tracks &quot;Then She Did...&quot; and &quot;Of Course&quot; are fantastic, featuring most of its emphasis on Farrell's high-pitched vocals and the violins and strings. The excellent &quot;Classic Girl&quot; concludes the album and is one of the strongest tracks here. Everything here is great and this surely ranks as one of the ten best rock albums of the '90s. Although the band would reunite years later and continue to make good music, this album remains as their master work. Highly recommended.
B00004XOWM|1.0|i have never been a huge fan of limp bizkit but at least i could respect them for doing their own thing on three dollar bill.  but this cd is an absolutely pathetic attempt to please the MTV masses and they have even failed there.  it's completely unlistenable...although im sure they get plenty of MTV airtime anyways.
B00005JLO2|2.0|Period pieces and desert adventures have long always appealed to me. Watching intrepid explorers brave the vast, dry, and arid landscape is an exhilarating experience. So I think it says a lot that The Four Feathers did little for me, save for much yawning and a sudden desire to take a long nap. I'd actually been looking forward to seeing this film for several months so, bar none, this was probably the biggest disappointment of 2002, for me, at least.<br />Ledger stars as Harry Faversham, a British soldier in his majesty's army in the 19th century. Jack (Wes Bentley) is his best friend, a brave soldier who envies Harry because of his lovely fiancee, Ethne (Kate Hudson). All seems well for the happy couple, until war is declared in the Sudan against the zealous Mahdi. Harry, after a long night of deep thought, elects to resign his commission and unsurprisingly, is deemed a complete coward by his own friends, who send him four feathers as a symbol of his disgrace (the fourth is sent by Ethne, Jack chooses not to believe he's a coward).<br />Distraught over the feathers, Harry decides to tag along and help his comrades in any way he can. Naturally, he's a bit in over his head and has to be saved time and again by a desert warrior named About Fatma (Djimon Honsou), who has taken it upon himself to protect Faversham, for reasons that are never made explicitly clear. Does Harry get a chance to prove his mettle in combat? Do I even have to ask?<br />The fundamental premise at work sounds great, but a quick glance informs us of a barrage of head-spinning plot holes. We're never really told what to think of Harry, except that he might not be the brightest guy in England. Put it this way, he actually spends an entire night chewing over his decision to resign and not for a moment did he actually seem to consider the fact that resigning right after war has been declared might, oh, deem him a coward. Should he really have been surprised by those feathers he was sent?<br />Then there's his decision to sneak into the Sudan. In one of the movie's more jarring edits, we're never shown how he got there; he's just there in one scene. In a period piece adventure, it's my firm belief as much detail as possible should be given. Anyway, his plan makes no sense; he decides he'll try and help, but what exactly can he do that a heavily-armed and well-trained army couldn't do without him? When all is said and done, I'm not even sure what point the film's trying to make, that personal honor and reputation is more important than holding firm to your beliefs (not that the movie ever established Harry as a pacifist, otherwise I doubt he'd ever have joined the army, even with his father as an officer)? <br />Ambiguity is evident in the Kate Hudson character, and not in an intriguing manner, either. Are we supposed to assume that she cares more about her &quot;image&quot; than Harry? Then when she displays regret over sending the feather, are we supposed to gather that she's truly changed or just in need of a suitor? On the other end of the spectrum, there's Jack, whose dedication to both Harry and Ethne is actually rather touching.<br />And thus leads to the love triangle, which I could have done without. Actually, I'll give a spoiler warning here because I mean to reveal the ending. Ethne obviously will return to Harry, leaving poor Jack blinded and only with his honor to comfort him. If you ask me, she chose the wrong guy. <br />The action/adventure aspects of the movie are pulled off just as poorly. What should have been a rip-roaring epic is instead very badly edited, scenes cutting from one to another without a sense of timing or pacing, almost as if though whole chunks were lifted from the film entirely. The film's big battle sequence is a clunker, with a few well-staged and well-shot moments (loved Ledger's leap onto the horse), but is mostly unexciting and frustratingly dull. The director fails to capture the odds the army was up against, gives us little of the much needed hand-to-hand combat and overdoses on the slow motion.<br />The Four Feathers was directed by Shekhar Kapur, who has shown talent with Elizabeth, but you'd think the man who crafted this had no discernable skills. True, the movie boasts the occasional bit of lovely cinematography, but come on, we know that's due more to the stunning locations than the camerawork. There are a few bright spots, Honsou and Bentley deliver fine performances, but I think I have the right to expect better from an eighty-million dollar production of a classic story.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I haven't seen the dvd yet obviously but I saw this in theaters last night and it was phenomenal.  Very, very moving.  Wonderful performances of George's best songs by his best friends.  The commentary from the people involved was very touching as well.  It is easy to see how much they truly loved George and what a great songwriter he was.
B00000IGGA|5.0|A great CD!!!.  I do not know if there are any words to describe the greatness of Waits music and Lyrics.  Mule Variations delivers!!  A great disc and a must have for anyone who appreciates music of any kind!!!
B00009V7RF|5.0|Black Eyed Peas have made a dramatic change in the style in which they wish to portray themselves. They used to be &quot;Tribe Called Quest&quot; style alternative Hip-Hop. Now, in sticking to that flava, have almost redesigned the genre, making them pioneers of new age hip-hop. I personally think this album is a fresh and brilliantly artistic display of what Hip-Hop is today, which is just fun, upbeat, &quot;move your ass to this&quot; music. The Amazon critic is smoking crack for that crazy ass review. This album is a must buy!!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol is truly one of the most original sounding groups in years.  I admit I was first drawn to this group after hearing comparisons to Joy Division, but they are entirely unique in their own right.  You can hear influences of many bands on this CD, but the end result is a sound quite unlike any other.  It is tight, mesmerizing, and best played loud.  Enjoy...
B00005JM1F|3.0|I rented this film after it was recommended by many of my friends. I expected it to be a laugh-a-minute ride into the world of youth remembered. While there are several humorous moments to be enjoyed, overall it was not as hilarious as I expected it to be. In my opionion, this film should have focused more on delivering laughs then delivering a message. I give this film 3 stars.
0066620996|5.0|This is a great book. It is probably the best-researched book I have ever read on management. I recommend this book along with &quot;Strategic Organizational Change&quot; by Beitler, and &quot;Organizational Culture &amp; Leadership&quot; by Schein.<br />Larry Chifton<BR>Charlotte, NC
B000001FFJ|5.0|Is there anyone better than Tom Waits.  One of his best albums ever.   So many tracks and such musical greatness.  The tracks &quot;Jockey Full of Bourbon&quot;,  &quot;Gun Street Girl&quot;, &quot;Blind Love&quot;, and &quot;Downtown Train&quot; are amazing along with every other track on this album.  This is a must own!!!
B00003CXTG|1.0|I have to add my two cents to this atrocity of a film, and be at one with the mob howling for the head of the director, Michael Bay.  This is the 'Showgirls' of American war movies, it's that bad.  There, I've said it.<br />1.  I understand that some Hollywood culture-vultures rounded up some actual veterans of the Pearl Harbor battle and \\"honored\\" them by exposing them to this film.  I'd like to have been able to tell these unfortunate victims that those insensitive moguls are now safely tucked away at Guantanamo with blacked-out goggles and duct tape over their mouths.  I really wish I could.<br />2.  History?  Oh, no, no, no.  It is closer to a version of Army-Navy Comics from 1943, the one where American super-heroes take on Japs single-handed with super-neato flying tanks and rocket planes.  See Rafe join the RAF to teach the Limeys how to really fly.  See Rafe shoot down Jap Zeroes at Pearl Harbor piloting his P-40 like an X-Wing Starfighter, pausing to help out wounded Gis at the aid station, and then help rescue drowning sailors.  See Rafe lead the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo.  See Rafe.... well, that would be giving away the movie's ending.<br />3.  I recall watching a 1942 film on the late night, called \\"Air Force\\" or some such.  In it, the last B-17 lands at Wake Island before the Japanese, rescues a Marine's puppy dog, and then flys on (the same flight) to blow the whole toy Japanese fleet out of the water.  I guess that movie was 50 years ahead of its time.<br />4.  If \\"Pearl Harbor\\" admitted to the world  it was nothing more than a dime-store pulp adventure story a-la Indiana Jones, all this (well, leaving out the absurd and interminable menage-a-trois love story) would be moderately tolerable.  But the horror of \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is that it panders to pass itself off as a serious and meaningful.  This disqualifies the movie from status as a potential camp classic.<br />3.  \\"Rafe?\\"  When was the last time you encountered anyone named \\"Rafe?\\"  The last \\"Rafe\\" I remember was in Carol Burnett's brief and now sadly unavailable 1980s miniseries, \\"Fresno\\", a comic parody of the popular evening soap, \\"Falcon Crest\\", which hilariously substituted a raisin plantation for `Falcon Crest's' winery.  In \\"Fresno\\", `Rafe' was a bare-chested stud who strolls around rescuing farm-workers from bullies, etc.  Burnett would wrap her lips around the name, \\"Rafe...Rafe...\\" Well, I guess you had to see it.<br />4.  The Japanese are to this movie what the icebergs are to the Titanic, an random act of God interrupting a love story.  Sort of a \\"Days of Our Lives\\" meets the Lusitania.<br />5.  No one plays baseball at 7 am on a Sunday morning in December. Others have pointed this out.  Mistakes like this are important.<br />Parental advisory: repeated viewing will make your children retarded, and flunk U.S. History.  The war scenes are done in post-PR (Private Ryan) style and are therefore somewhat graphic.ast \\"Rafe\\" I remember was in Carol Burnett's brief and now sadly unavailable 1980s miniseries, \\"Fresno\\", a comic parody of the popular evening soap, \\"Falcon Crest\\", which hilariously substituted a raisin plantation for `Falcon Crest's' winery.

0440219078|5.0|\\"You never know what you have until it's gone\\", is the best way to sum up this book. In a perfect society where everything is planned out to the smallest detail there is very little room for change. This book shows how well a planned out society could work. There would be no one homeless, starving, or underprivileged. Everyone would live comfortably but they also would have to give up certain details of their everyday life. Something as simple as color could make a world of difference. The Giver was a wonderfully thought out book that helped to show that nothing can be perfect, at least not forever.
B000060K4P|5.0|First I want to say, about the special effects, 1.) Of course they don't look as good if it were made today it was 20 years ago. 2.) Special Efects shouldn't be the main focus of ANY film or it makes them really crappy...The Matrix for example. The first film was great, they had a team of people that just couldn't lose. The script was funny by itself bt the timing in which the cast did it in made it good. The second film, wasn't as good, but that's mainly because by that time they had the &quot;Real Ghostbusters&quot; cartoon show and comic books making them have to tone down a lot of the content knowing that the product was now primarily a childrens concept. If they had as mauch sexual content or adult language in #2 then the comic book lable and DiC would have lost viewers when the parents see that Ghostbusters &quot;isn't really for kids.&quot; They had nothing to lose in the first because no one knew what to expect but the second one already had something that it was based on so of course it wasn't as good. But that's not to say it isn't good.
B000002GYG|5.0|An essential for a Waits fan.  A great example of barroom music at its best.  The songs &quot;warm beer and cold women(need I say more)&quot;,&quot;better without a wife&quot;, and &quot;Big Joe and the phantom 309&quot; are great tracks.  Waits makes you feel you are sitting in the bar with him!!!  Waits is in a class of his own!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Putting all of that whining aside by other reviewers, this is one of THE if not THE best movie of all time. Sure the sound could be better or whatever, there's always room for improvement. Look beyond, and get yourself ready for one of the ultimate masterpieces of all time.
0385505833|5.0|Skipping Christmas is about a family who's daughter goes to South America for Christmas. The father, Luther Krank, a penny pinching buisnessman decides that he and his wife, Nora, will not be spending Christmas this year but go on a wonderful cruise. Their plans are thwarted by a simple phone call that tells them that their daughter will be coming home and with a fiancee. She thinks that a large party is in store for her when she returns and expects lavish decorations all over the house. As you might guess, hilarity ensues which comes to show that you should be ready for any single thing that comes your way.
B000007XUQ|5.0|Christmas Collection brings the Carpenters' two holiday albums together for one double-cd. &quot;Christmas Portrait&quot;, the duo's 1978 release, still stands as perhaps the greatest Christmas album ever recorded. Karen's soft, warm voice over a dazzling selection of beautifully arranged Christmas songs, is a perfect cup of hot chocolate for the season. There are just enough standards and new songs to keep everyone happy, while interested. And Richard's choral and orchestral arrangements allow one song to flow gently into the next, creating a symphony of sound that communicates Christmas better than any other CD on the market.<BR>The second disc &quot;An Old-Fashioned Christmas&quot; was released in 1984, a year after Karen's death. Without the same amount of material, Richard re-entered the studio and arranged several additional songs. &quot;Old Fashioned Christmas&quot; is beautiful and perfectly arranged, yet features much less of Karen, understandably. The highlight is the slow-down ballad version of &quot;Santa Claus is Comin' to Town&quot; - one of the most romantic versions of a children's Christmas song ever attempted. Still, even without Karen on every track, Richard manages to engage the listener with beautiful music that again captures the essence of the season.
B000089RVX|5.0|For 6 years I had one favorite band of all time.  Ever since 1997 when I started to listen to a CD for the first time, I knew that no CD would ever top my favorite band.  I felt the same way when I first placed Evanescence's album &quot;Fallen&quot; into my cd player.  I have to say, I was wonderfully suprised.  Evanescence is now, in my opinion, the best band of all time.<br />These days, most songs center around sex and love and aren't worthwhile.  Amy Lee's songs go deeper than that and show real and true emotion and portray real emotions that a lot of young people go through.  It's nice to know that other people are going through the same things.  Coupling that with Amy's wonderful voice and vocal talent, Amy, Ben, John and Rocky make 'Fallen' a must-have.<br />Best tracks: ALL OF THEM!!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Alright, this wasn't as good as Mer de Noms, let's just say that right off. It was too soft, too mellow, and it never seemed to crest.<BR>But the vocals kick butt, as always, and I have a special affection for it as Twiggy, once of Marilyn Manson, joined it. The only song I adore on here is Pet, Track 10, which I've had on loop all day. It's a five-star song, but the rest drags it down. I seem to have a thing for Perfect Circle's tenth tracks, as both Pet and Thinking Of You have been my easy favourites on their respective albums.
6302989787|4.0|This interesting little suspence tale starring Clint Eastwood, Rene Russo, and John Malcovich goes into the world of politics. Eastwood plays FBI agent Frank Horrigan, a man who's been haunted by the fact that he couldn't save Kennedy after the first shot had been fired. Malcovich brilliantly plays Mitch Leary, a psychotic man who's only goals are to taunt Horrigan and to assaninate the president. Russo plays Lilly Raines, the female agent who is bothered by Horrigan's lame attempts to woo her and to help Horrigan solve the mess that Leary has made. Good movie and watch for Gary Coleman,Dylan McDermott, John Heard, and Ed Harris as well.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Casablanca is one of those movies that everyone can find something to like about it.  Even 70 years later, this movie is still one of the most popular movies ever made.  Set in the city of Casablanca in unoccupied French territory, the story is full of intrigue, a triangle love story, great characters, and too many one-liners to even mention.  In Casablanca, people are desperately trying to get travel visas out of the city so they can get to America as the war draws closer.  Two German couriers carrying visas are murdered making everyone wonder where the documents are.  From here we are introduced to Rick, a bar owner who apparently has no allegiance except to himself.  One night, the love of his life walks in to his bar setting the whole story in motion.  This is a fabulous movie that can be watched over and over again.  It has all the elements of a great movie and should not be missed.<br /> Humphrey Bogart was never better than his role as Rick, the bartender who looks out only for himself.  Simply put, this is one of the coolest characters in movie history.  Ingrid Bergman is great as Ilsa, a woman who has a romantic link to Rick in the past.  Bogie and Bergman are great together throughout making their relationship truly believable.  Paul Henried stars as Victor Lazslo, Ilsa's husband and leader of the resistance movement.  Claude Rains gives an excellent performance as Captain Renault, a French officer who plays both the Allies and the Germans.  The film also stars Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Conrad Veidt.  The two-disc special edition should not be missed by fans of the movie.  There are too many extras to even mention, but they are all worthwhile.  Movie fans everywhere will love this classic movie.  Do not miss!
B000065V41|3.0|A poor excuse...this DVD is completely edited from it's original release.  FULL FRAME!  Wonderful acting and story of course.  So if you just want something cheap for the little ones it's great.  If you really want a good DVD of this film, then you'll have to look elsewhere.  Who was the brain who decided adults don't want quality Muppets DVDs?  The laserdisc was widescreen with no edits.
0767840135|4.0|This is probably the second best after Alegria..<BR>what really got my attention was the skipping rope...<BR>it was fabulous..4out of 5 stars
0385421982|5.0|This one is definately my favorite. It starts off with grip as an elderly supreme court justice is murdered in his own home along with the kindly nurse that watches him and the two guards that watch the house. Another man is strangled to death in a movie theater showing gay porn. Anyway, a bright young student by the name of Darby Shaw writes a report on this for her law class. Her teacher/boyfriend, Thomas Callahan, reads it and a day later is blown up in his car. She contacts an FBI agent who reads it and when planning to meet her in a park, is bludgened to death in his own hotel room. She then contacts a Washington Post reporter by the name of Grey Grantham and he follows her story eventually running into some exciting situations. This one's a classic and a must read.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I bought this CD for the song &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; and found the rest of the songs to be just as good. John Mayer covers the gammet with slow, soulful melodies, as well as kicking it up a little with other songs. If you're preference in song voice is quiet and strong, this CD might work for you.
B000084T18|4.0|First, all people give this lower than 4 star is stupid,<BR>this album have many HOT beat and music,<BR>Dr. Dre is my FAVORITE PRODUCER!<BR>ONLY the beat of \\"In Da Club\\" is worth you purchase!<BR>In Da Club is one of the best song I ever hear!<BR>Dr. Dre is genius!!!<br />so let's talk about those HOT songs first,<br />What Up Gangsta - is a nice song to start this album! 8/10<br />Patiently Waiting - 8/10<br />Many Man [Wish Death] - 8/10<br />In Da Club - THE BEST SONG IN THIS ALBUM! 10/10<br />High All The Time - 7/10<br />Heat - The Gun shot beat by Dre is nice! 7/10<br />If I Can't - another BIG HIT!!! 9/10<br />Blood Hound - 7.5/10<br />Back Down - another Dope Beat by Dre, but I think Fifty voice isn't suit this beat, I don't know why. 8.5/10<br />P.I.M.P. - the beat is nice, the remix featurin' Snoop D O double G and G unit, but the remix version not included. 8.5/10<br />Like My Style - 6/10<br />Poor Lil Rich - 6/10<br />21 Questions - uh! another hit!

B000002PCS|4.0|This soundtrack is truly one of the best soundtracks ever produced. However, to get your money's worth, you really should go with the pre-recording version. Not only are there more songs, but the sound recording is a lot better. I really wished they would have told me that the sound recording to the cd might contain  some hiss and &quot;other anomalies that exist with analog recordings&quot;. Amazon does not guarantee product satisfaction on products like these. So, just to be safe, and only for a dollar more, buy the pre-recording instead.
B00009RDG9|1.0|Folk's I am begining to wonder about the honesty on these reviews. The latest reviews are pushed off the front page and older one's that are positive are pushed forward. March is first Sept is down the list..... I HAVE no connections with any film industry people what's so ever. I wrote a review of The Hunted, that was from my heart and life experience, and this movie [stinks] BIG TIME. ONLY a child or moron unread type could like it. THIS is an example of HOOEYWEIRD ripping U.S. OFF! GIVE me my money back! I will gladly sell this...THIS is my review, of one the worst freaking movies I have ever seen. HIGH school theater class kids could have done better! THIS IS NOT EVEN <BR>A [cheap] movie, it's being sold at A HIGH PRICE TOO!!!!AHHH B.S. ONLY an idiot or some one connected to the movie business would rate this above five negative stars!. It is not worth seeing for free!
0553582445|3.0|Well... I'm a big fan of Robbin Hobbs. I loved the FarSeer trilogy, I thought the Living Ships trilogy was very good, but this new installment? I regret to inform you that this is not what a FarSeer fan would expect it to be.<br />The biggest problem is that Fitz has grown too old and weary. I can see why he became that way, he's had so much happen to him, but it doesn't make for an interesting book. The first hundred pages are devoted to Fitz's depressed ramblings and worries as he stays inside his cot doing pretty much nothing. Nothing happens to him, he doesn't make anything happen. It's so for such a long time that I almost wanted to put the book down. The only reason I kept going was that I thought the pace would eventually pick up. Even at her worst, Hobb's writing is so good that you keep on reading to simply see how she expresses Fitz's thoughts. (The book mainly consists of Fitz's thoughts. He thinks, thinks, and thinks.) <br />The good thing? I could completely believe everything that was happening. I'd expect someone who's gone through such trauma as Fitz has to be so depressed and boring and introverted. <br />Still. I mean, I didn't buy the book to read a study on the human mind. I bought it for an interesting read. Now interesting doesn't mean arrows and swords flying around, but it does mean cutting out some of the more uninteresting parts of life and displaying the more interesting parts. It's what every writer should do when revising. If the writer fails, the editer should do her job. You know what this book felt like? It felt like that girl in math class who CAN'T LEAVE A SINGLE THING OUT WHEN SHE'S TALKING. You know, the one who tells you who did what, when, where, how, in what manner, what it could have meant, what she thinks it meant, what her friend thinks it meant, her related expereinces... Until you just want to slap her to make her shut up.<br />Fitz doesn't connect with anyone else. He's stayed for too long in his cot (I told you to go outand excercise, Fitz!) and it shows. Throughout the whole book he'll connect with only two characters, and not that much. There's almost no dialogue, either. Because of Fitz's situation, which is being holed up all the time trying to conceal his identity, readers can't see what's going on. This is a big problem. The former books worked because the readers could live in the Six Duchies; now, along with Fitz, we are exiled and shuttered in the dark. <br />Hobbs should have either changed the plot so that Fitz had more going on, or she should have told it from another view point, a view point more free to roam and experience and live. Dutiful would have been a good choice. Maybe the Fool. Or else, like the Liveship trilogy, from a third point of view... Anything that wouldn't have made this book feel so thin and stretched out.<br />I'm disappointed. But I'm going to check out the next book to see if it's any better. I feel I have an obligation to see how the story ends.
B00005JKC3|4.0|It seems to me that some people ALWAYAS expect a superhero movie to be all about action (and HULK did have plenty of action in it) and want nothing to do about backstories.  Don't get me wrong, I can go for a brainless action movie as much as the next person, but to me HULK was an excellent psychologoical movie that dove to the essence of what HULK was all about.
B00005R23Z|5.0|Gattaca takes a cliched sci-fi theme, genetics engineering gone wrong, and makes of it an intelligent, haunting fable about society stifling individuals, and of over coming obstacles to follow the true desires of one's heart.<br />The screen writing is achingly beautiful. It speaks of many things; the rivalry that exists between brothers, a society that will judge a human being not by who he is but by his genes, and of a normal person who will break through all the walls such a society sets in front of him to fulfill the longing of his heart, the space. <br />I felt like crying after watching the movie, there were so many emotions stirred up inside me. It shook me to my very core. The only time I felt that way after watching a movie was when I watched Shawshank Redemption. I felt so angry for Vincent and the way the world is in Gattaca. I felt so much sorrow for Jude Law. When the movie finally ended, I felt a shock of hope, the kind of hope you get when you see how life can work out despite all the odds. It's a movie that will definitely make you think and feel.  <br />Ethan Hawke's acting is, as usual, subtle and believable. It's said that making the protagonist narrate a story isn't a good idea, but Ethan Hawke somehow makes it work. (Think 'Great Expectations.') He doesn't over-act to make you see his point; he doesn't shout, he doesn't sob, he doesn't whisper. He just becomes Vincent the in-Valid. There's no Ethan Hawke to be seen, only a very human, very determined man who will go to space no matter what. <br />Jude Law does a great job as supporting actor. Arrogant, short-tempered and yet with a warm heart, his character comes to life quite well. As an invalid Valid, if you'll pardon the pun, he represents all the irony this futuristic caste system brought. Sitting around in the basement drinking beer, he casts a new light onto the story and onto Vincent's plight. (Did anyone else like the line 'I'm bored, I'm BORED talking to you!' as much as I did? ^-^) <br/>Uma Thurman was okay. There's nothing noticeable about her acting, but I guess that was the whole point. The spotlight falls on Vincent as it should. <br />One of the most brilliant science-fiction movies of the decade, it's a joy to watch and a pleasure to remember. Worth your money.
B000084T18|1.0|This CD is garbage. Dude is one of the worst MC's I've ever heard. He's very unoriginal and monotone with his music. Ja Rule would crush him anyday.<br />Don't buy it, download the hits and thats it.<br />If you like real Hip Hop then Talib Kweli, Nas, KRS-One, The Roots, and Big L do the job!<br />And this dude trys to be Pac, he will (and nobody else) NEVER be Pac. Only one Tupac. RIP.
B000067J1H|2.0|My God! Really! Everybody I know hated this movie!<br />The first half of it was brilliant. Cool, noir atmosphere, beautfiul dialogue, great acting, beautiful action, interesting theme... <br />Then in the later half, the movie falls apart. First of all, unlike the book, the movie was visual and therefore unable to hide it's major twist for a long time. When I read the book, it was like 'Oh my God! So that was it! So that was what was happening!' Since I already read the book before I saw the movie, I knew what was happening all along so I have no say. But my brother and his friends, all of whom watched the movie first, caught on in first twenty minutes and things became kind of stale after that. <br />Then there's the sheer impossibility of it all. Yes, it's a dark fantasy not meant to be realistic in the fist place. Yet the book managed to stay true to life and believable because of the blase manner in which it is presented and the foggy atmosphere of the book. The movie tries too hard for too much and in effect makes itself look ridiculous. The director tries to make everything too cool, so that there's nothing but coolness. The bare suppressed seething rage of the book is nowhere to be seen. Brad Pitt struts his muscles and cool yellow sunglasses, Norton becomes a super-anti-hero, so what.<br />I believe that the movie would have been a lot better if it had kept true to the book's version of the story. This is bad screen adaptation at its worst. The ending was a standard Hollywood &quot;Everything's gone and done now, let's be happy and party!&quot; kind of happy ending. God, PLEASE. This simply isn't that kind of movie! It's meant to be about rage, about loss, about self-contempt, and about all that it promised in the beginning. Going for a cheap trick end, though, it ends on an unbelievable turn and will leave a lot of you disappointed.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is very faithful to the book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It has terific acting,great direction,and a very good story.The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that the visuals were not that great and I like the darker scope of the second better.Despite its flaws(of which there are few),It is a very faithful adaption.Potter fans should be pleased!!!!!!!!!!
0385504209|5.0|Not sure what I can say that has not already been said by the hundreds of reviewers who have weighed in on the subject.  But anyway, I will...  I found the plot very fast-paced and a good page turner.  However, I was a bit dismayed at the lack of depth in the historical backing of many of the details.  If you are interested in this type of fiction, I would recommend Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum, which I still reread from time to time.<br />I thought Brown laid a good foundation utilizing Opus Dei as one of the main antagonists in the book, but so much more could have been done developing this facet of the book, and moreover the last few chapters really had me asking for more.<br />Nevertheless, Brown has made a good effort, and if you want a book that you can read over the course of a rainy weekend, then this is one for you.  I enjoyed it, but would have liked to see Brown develop the plot just a bit more.<br />Enjoy!
B00008DDXC|5.0|I thought this was even better than the first.The story is darker,the acting is better(Daniel Radcliffe seems more relaxed as Harry this time),and the visuals are WAY better than they were in the first one!!!!!!!!!See this if you are a fan of the books or if you like the first one!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A top album that every fan would be proud of owning.  From the start to the finish this album pleases.  The stand out tracks are<br />Weak And Powerless  <BR>The Noose  <BR>Blue  <BR>Vanishing  <BR>The Outsider          <BR>Crimes          <BR>Pet          <BR>Lullaby          <br />All these tracks are worth a listen and will convince you to buy the album.  A must have have.
0441009425|2.0|This was a very interesting book, but it took me seemingly forever to get it read. It's really laborious. The author jumps around much too much and trys to get too way out for me. I could not keep all the ends together. And it didn't seem to have an ending. The following book, Chasm City, I thought was to be a sequel, which I don't care much for, but that turned out to be not the case. In any event, I think the austhor has a lot of promise and future books should be better.
B00009P57O|5.0|This is one the better cd issues, or re-issues of Synchronicity. Not only does this album come in a nice clear-spine case (oh yeh!), it has full lyrical listing, the obligatory bonus track (Murder by Numbers), and finally, a great high quality quicktime-video of Every Breath You Take! <BR>Well worth buying!
B0000CABJ1|3.0|Enough is enough is enough ! ...The first time I saw just the cd cover of this &quot;latest&quot; collection of hits w/o reading the title first, I thought the Live and More album had been re-released ! I thought it was re-mastered and in it's full length glory (which should have included MacArthur Park Suite). I thought FINALLY the original Live and More from 1978 had come to the light on cd format to compensate for the chopped up early 90's version that was released w/o the famous headshot cover and the famous 17 minute studio suite...<br />Nope...<br />Just another collection with a few new tracks thrown in to whet the appetite. Nothing more...I give up hoping for new updated material from one of pop music's best female singers of the 70's and 80's. If you don't own any of Summer's albums, cds, or any other &quot;Best Of&quot; or &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, then knock yourself out with this one. Regardless if it's Donna's decision or input or the record company's (you get the point)...If one was to compile just a cd's worth of new tracks that are always released with each release of a hits collection, it could probably be put on 2 discs as new material !<br />Because the songs are top dance classics from the 70's and Summer's vocal abilities go beyond what even most of today's pop singers wish they could aspire to, this gets 3 stars...
B00005AWMF|5.0|Sade has always been an Amazing Lyricist with Baby making Grooves! This Compilation Prooves it! You can't get any better then this! Not only is her sultry voice amazing the Order of the songs is nearly perfect. With such songs as &quot;your Love Is king&quot; and &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; Which by far are amazing! And the Ultimate RNB Classic &quot;This is No ordinary Love&quot; That Song Alone is worth the Money! The Mixes Of Rnb,Blues,Soul And jazz is fused into One Peice of Ooey Gooey Get ya groove on type of Music! My advice IS buy it! Its good for &quot;love making&quot;
B000089A06|5.0|I went to see this movie, and I will tell you it was excellent, and for those of you who would deam me unfit to give this movie a good review, I can tell I have viewed the original. This movie far surpasses the original, in acting, the way the plot is played out, and scenery. The previews of Anthony Hopkins reprising his Oscer winnig role as Dr. Lecter were excellent. He owns the role of Dr. Lecter doing much better that Brian Cox did in Man Hunter. Ed Nortan was a little off the bare when I thought of this guy cathing Dr. Lecter. I was thinking suuuure, I mean Dr. Lecter would kick this guys ass in a second, but it worked out beautifully and payed omage to the story. The interactions between the two were reminicent of Dr. Lecter and Clarice Starling, even though in this movie Dr. Lecter and Wille Gram show that they hate each other, the docter still plays his mind games, and toyes with Gram even more ruthlessly then when it came to Clarice Starling. I also enjoyed the way that you get the feeling of how dangerous Dr. Lecter really is as in the scenes with him in his cell, it took about two ordarlies, and four armed policemen to just move him around. And even just exercising he was under swat team servalence being targeted by guns everywere in his exercise area, witch went to show how much of an animal people thought of him since exercise pens like that are usually used for hourses. Well anyway I thought this movie was excellent, in every way, and did far better than the original versions in every aspect. Thank you very much.
B00001NFCY|5.0|One word Can describe this C.D. and that is &quot;WOW!&quot;.  I was simply blowned away by this C.D. Every Signle Song on this C.D is great! With a sound like Led zepplin! and Poetry sounding like it Came From Jim Morrison Himself! Creed comes through on this sophmore effort with flying colors. The Key Tracks on this C.D are &quot;What If&quot; A great Power song! you can feel the Adrenaline going through your veins on this one! Then The Beautifully arranged &quot;beautiful&quot; With Rocking guitars as if they stole it from Hendrix's Basement!. The Poetic Faceless man. One of my favorite tracks &quot;Never Die&quot;. ANd the 2 legendary Songs on this Album The Inspirational &quot;Higher&quot; And the quasi religious &quot;With arms Wide open&quot; And The song Closer Inside us all is highly inspirational and is intellect spanding!. You can't get any better then this. With Songs Written Like they were the doors Creed is probably the best rock band out and thats all i have to say about that!
B000001Y5D|5.0|Of course, I heard &quot;What's Up&quot;.  Who hasn't?  It is one of those songs that is instantly likeable and impossible to forget.  However, I must admit that I did not know of any other songs by 4 Non Blondes.  In fact, I did not even know the name of the Band, until very recently I had this urge to listen to &quot;What's Up&quot; again and started digging for the CD that had the song.  I basically bought the CD just for that song.<br />And what a find it was.  I am a big fan of good vocals.  Now I knew from What's Up that Linda Perry (again, didn't even know the name till lately) had a great voice, but I was not at all prepared for this.  From the first song, Ms Perry's voice explodes out of the speakers, and fill the expanses of the room which seems to vibrate from its sheer energy.  Influence of Blues is evident throughout the CD and the style has more in common with blues-streaked big bands of 70's rather than so-called &quot;female singer-songwriters&quot;  of late.  Ms Perry's voice  and style is more Janis Joplin (or even Robert Plant) than Alainis.<br />Because of the intensity of Ms Perry's voice, this CD is not something I could listen to over and over again.(with the exception of What's Up).  But when I do play this CD, it always makes me stop whatever I was doing and feel the sonic explosion of her voice. I know that Ms Perry is still in the Music business working  with the likes of Pink and Aguilera. While that's all good and fine, I still wish that she will decide to pick up the mike again, not just her guitar.
B000001FS3|5.0|U2 Has to Be one the Greatest Rock Band That has ever lived. And this C.D. PPROVES IT!  With Hits like &quot;where the streets have no name&quot; and &quot; I still havenet found what im looking for&quot; And the Ever so Mystical &quot;in Gods Country: Bono Mixes his soothing Yet ecclatic Voice With The HArmonic Melodies discusing Politic's, Love And Redemption. But One Song Makes this Entire C.D. And thats &quot;With Or Without You&quot;. I would buy this C.D just for that song Cause it blends The Soft Rnbish Rock With Poetic Lyrics about Redemption! Probably the Best Song to listen to after mourning a Difficult Relationship. My advice is Buy this C.D. Cause it will soothe your soul and advance your intellect.
B00008DDSC|4.0|This film is an offbeat but engaging story of a young woman who is a true submissive. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Lee, a young woman who survived a stint in a mental hospital and a recent secretarial school graduate. She begins looking for work, and is hired by a lawyer, Edward (the always slighty creepy James Spader) who runs his office in a strangely old-fashioned way. Edward soon finds out that Maggie has a secret: she's a cutter, who deals with her emotional pain by inflicting physical pain on herself. Edward takes control of the situation, and helps Lee replace her cutting with a full-blown S&amp;M relationship with him. The film is funny and quirky, but also an affective portrait of a woman who can only truly find happiness through submission. Maggie Gyllenhaal manages to be funny, vulnerable, and sexy all at the same time. Overall, a very worthwhile film.
B00006LI4S|4.0|....and that song is Comfortably Numb with Bob Geldof singing. Stunning. It is good to see Gilmour off the gravy train and doing music under his own name. It's a lot more honest than the stuff he was doing in the 80s and early 90s.
0679720200|4.0|The Stranger is a short novel that is fascinating as a character study. The protagonist is a young man, Meursault, who has a strangely detached, and yet benevolent, way of looking at the world. Mostly, he lives moment to moment, resigned and seemingly unmoved by most of what happens around him (including his mother's death). After a series of unfortunate events, Meursault finds himself on trial for murder, and those responsible for his fate mistake his detachment for evil and callousness. This novel shows how society treats people who are different, and how people are all too quick to label people &quot;evil&quot; that they don't understand.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is A Perfect Circle's second album, and it is another work of art. Much of the album is a bit heavier, but it does not take away from the artistic value of the music. Their first track &quot;The Package&quot; is part mellow, part hard-core, with each being perfectly balanced. and tracks 3-6 have the memorable APC softness and asthetic to the melodies. &quot;The Outsider&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot; capture APC's talent to play such diverse tempos and moods. &quot;Gravity&quot; displays, Maynard James Keenan's smooth, ethereal singing voice that adds to the thought-provoking lyrics and atmospheric music. This album should not be missed!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|With cookie-cutter teen comedies a dime a dozen, this film manages to combine realistic and empathetic teen characters, an intriguing science fiction premise, black comedy, and just plain weirdness to create a startlingly original film. Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific as Donnie Darko, a highly intelligent and mentally ill young man who is perceptive enough to see through the phoniness of many of the adults around him, but still vulnerable and awkard in the endearing way teenagers are. Some of the characters who inhabit his world include his smug, Harvard-bound older sister (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a cheesy self-help guru (Patrick Swayze), the mysterious new girl in school (Jena Malone) and an idealistic teacher (Drew Barrymore). Time travel, a talking demonic rabbit, vandalism, a Star Search-bound dance troupe called &quot;Sparkle Motion&quot; ... these are all some of the plot twists that lead the film along to it's ambiguous and thought-provoking conclusion. Check it out!
B00000I41J|5.0|This was one of my favorite albums during my early middle school years.  I listened to it virtually every day for months on end.  There's no surprise why; Miles is at his best on this record and Cannonball, who is surprisingly less eminent here, still sounds great when he does play.  Hank Jones was always a wonderful, tasteful pianist and here there is no difference.  Art Blakey keeps a great beat throughout.  &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; is classic Miles Davis with his harmon mute, right up there with &quot;Blue In Green&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;, and so many others.  Cannonball sounds great here but Miles truly steals the show.  The same thing happens on &quot;Love For Sale&quot;, which was a tune that became a standard part of the late 50's repertoire for Miles and company.  Hank Jones really gets into some good stuff on his piano solo, especially his introduction.  Cannonball only solos once but it's fire, and Miles and Hank take the rest.  On the title track, Miles and Cannonball collaborate brilliantly on a tune where they trade parts of the theme.  The results are great.  Great soloing.  The best part is that Miles shows that his chops have really skyrocketed nailing some nice High F's and the like.  &quot;One For Daddy-O&quot; is a slow blues where Cannonball really pulls out some of his best playing.  His amazing technique tears through the heart of the blues and Miles plays a great solo as well.  It's a classic blues.  On &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot;, Cannonball solos wonderfully on this tender ballad and it remains tasteful throughout.  Miles returns for a playful &quot;Allison's Uncle&quot; to close out this album.<br />This is an under-rated classic.  Any fan of the Miles Davis Quintets and Sextets of the 1950's will love this album.
0792844882|4.0|I saw this movie 3 times in the theatre, and I've seen it easily 50 times since. It is one of the funniest movies of all time. It's so exploitive, so ridiculous, and so offensive that it's become a cult film the likes of which hasn't been seen since \\"Rocky Horror\\". Elizabeth Berkeley (whose acting chops were adequate enough for \\"Saved by the Bell\\" but hardly enough to carry a film) plays Nomi, an ex-hooker who moves to Vegas to become a dancer, but has to pay the bills stripping at a seedy bar. After catching the eye of the bisexual lead in a big hotel show called \\"Goddess\\" (the smoking hot Gina Gershon, who is the only one whose career was actually helped by this film), Nomi is able to get a more legit (albeit still topless) dancing job. From there, drugs, catfights, violence, and betrayal ensue. Althought the script and most of the acting performances are awful, this movie does have wonderfully gaudy costumes and set designs, and some of the music is pretty good, too (My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, David Bowie, etc.) Hang out with your friends, watch this movie, and laugh your butt off.
B000025XKM|5.0|I'm not sure why I'm writing this. If 199 reviews with an average of 5 stars apiece (4.8 if you get technical about it) didn't convince you I'm not sure what more I can say. But here goes.<br />There have been few albums in artists that have made such a beautiful account of standing on the edge, of being depressed, disillusioned, longing, and sheer loneliness. Yes, Nick Drake encapsulates all these emotions so simply and so poignantly in a mere 26 minutes, with only shimmering accoustic guitar to accompany him. His lyricism is powerful, his poetry is romantic, his voice is angelic and his guitar play is as virtuosic as they come. And when he sang, he sang as if he meant everything he wrote. He sang with desparation when he sang \\"Oh so weak in the palest blue, so weak in this need for you,\\" with bitterness when he sang \\"Know that I love you. Know that I'm not there\\" and with sadness when he sang \\"I am the parasite of your town.\\" And he didn't need a single distortion pedal, amp, a band, or even a pick! There is no filter from the things in his heart to the mic, just him!<br />So those of watch tragic movies, lamented with Dylan when he sang Not Dark Yet, listen to Norah Jones and Jack Johnson and folk and blues or any other music that sings of inner frustrations, or play an accoustic guitar for that matter, you needto hear Pink Moon badly!<br />(Note: Nick Drake's music overall isn't as depressed as some would lead you to believe. If this is too disturbed for you, Bryter Layter might be more to your liking. But get Five Leaves Left too. No matter which one you buy first, you'll want the other two as soon as you hear it.
B000002NJS|5.0|After improving her voice for &quot;Evita&quot; and becoming a mother, Madonna's fans couldn't wait to see the affects on her music. The result? Spectacular. &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is the best album of Madonna's career. With her newly improved vocals dressed in liquidy, psychadelic electronica (courtesy of Williams Orbit), Madonna opens her heart about her newfound spirituality, motherhood, and still unsatisfactory love life (this album was made pre Guy Ritchie). &quot;Drowned World&quot; opens the album with the line &quot;I traded fame for love&quot;, and goes onto describe the emptiness of fame. &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, one of the best dance songs ever, is about opening yourself up to unity and ecstacy. &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; and &quot;Skin&quot; are seductive and erotic without being the least bit sleazy. &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Power of Goodbye&quot; are both captivating electro-ballads about love lost. And &quot;Little Star&quot; is a gorgeous and sincere love song to her daughter. Over five years since its release, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; still holds up as one of the greatest pop albums of all time.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck manages yet again to be unique, interesting, and poingant all at the same time. Sea Change is in the same spirit as Mutations,  but with Sea Change, Beck manages to take his work to entirely new level.  Not suprisingly, thanks to his earlier work, this album is a mix of folk, country, rock, classical and a dash of techno. Although completely different than Odelay, this album is of the same quality.
B00005Y7L4|5.0|Very good movie. I strongly reccomend this movie to anyone who enjoys strange movies, because you've never ever seen a movie like this. <BR>It's the future... Kids have stopped going to class, and are becoming pests. So the government has started a new program called the &quot;BATTLE ROYALE SURVIVAL PROJECT.&quot; What happens is that one class of 9th graders a year is chosen by impartial lottery to go onto a deserted island. The kids then get 'voted off' the island. And by 'voted off' I mean they kill each other. Each kid gets a bag, inside is food, water, a map, and a random weapon. With this weapon, they are ordered to kill each other until one remains. <BR>This movie has everything. Violence, plot, character development (somewhat -- enough to satasfy me), and an amazing story. It'll keep you on the end of your seat, or couch, or whatever.<br />Oh, and if you go out and see the new Tarantino movie, KILL BILL, the actress that plays Liu's bodyguard is one of the kids from Battle Royale. <BR>Buy this movie. I can't stress it enough.
B000002GKT|5.0|PERFORMANCE- ROCKIN' THE FILLMORE is a great live album by Humble Pie, perhaps the top live act of the early 70s, with Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Outlaws being their later-in-the-decade counterparts. Besides bluesy singer-guitarist Steve Marriott, this lineup also boasted the more melodic Peter Frampton on guitar and vocals. This and HOT 'N' NASTY: THE ANTHOLOGY are the quintessential Humble Pie, so go out and get it- fast.
B000002J09|5.0|what do you mean they copy blues songs and make them boring, first off its not blues its rock n roll, second limb bizkit is the most pathetic band of all time, third there probally wouldnt be any metallica if there was 70s ROCK, NOT BLUES, even look here [...] its them dressed up as LZ, kirk hammet talks about how he looked up to jimmy page as an idol, as for slipknot, who the hell wants to see some lunatics dressed up as morons singing bloody murder while the guitarist plays an easy guitar riff, black dog isnt pathetic either, i bet the first 3 notes on black dog are harder than any slipknot song. dont get me wrong, i like metallica, but most of this music today wouldnt exist without 70s rock n roll
B00008WG3U|5.0|this cd is awesome its fast hard and PUNK!!i would recomend this cd to any who is into punk or even, and people who hate george bush. the best tracks are separation of the church and skate,idiots are taking over,and,NUBS!!!!
0385504209|4.0|Although Dan Brown's book falls far short as accurate history, I nevertheless found the novel to be an exciting portrayal of the tension and conflict between orthodox religious dogma and individual spirituality.  Many others have provided detailed analysis of Mr. Brown's work.  I'd like to simply suggest a couple sources for further reading on the subject.  One is a short, simple, experiential book, and the other is more detailed and rigorously researched.  The first is a picture book (but not just for children!) by Mark Shannon, illustrated by David Shannon.  THE ACROBAT AND THE ANGEL is a beautiful story of individual spiritual mystery (and the divine feminine) under the nose of Catholic orthodoxy.  Like THE LITTLE PRINCE, THE ACROBAT AND THE ANGEL can be enjoyed over and over again.  Also recommended is Karen Armstrong's A HISTORY OF GOD.  This remarkable, unbiased reference book has a wonderful chapter on the individual spirituality we call &quot;mysticism.&quot;  This is where the word &quot;mystery&quot; got its start.  She shows how healthy reason and authentic faith are compatible and strengthen each other.<br />So, hope this is a help to everyone who has been interested in Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE.  Enjoy!!!
B000089RVR|4.0|While she is no Sarah McLaughlin, British export Dido does a pretty good job of trying to come close.  On her new album, &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, she continues her introspective standard.  This cd seems to be a little more upbeat than her first release, &quot;No Angel&quot;.  There are several radio-friendly tracks here....especially the current single &quot;White Flag&quot;, &quot;See The Sun&quot;, &quot;Sand In My Shoes&quot;, and &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot;.  &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot; tends to be my favorite.  Her voice sounds really great on this track and the music is loud enough to give her a good backing sound.  Apart from the main tracklisting, there is an extra bonus song embedded behind &quot;See The Sun&quot;....so make sure to keep playing after that one is over!<br />If the radio doesn't tire us of Dido as they did with the few singles from &quot;No Angel&quot;, I think people will really appreciate this album....and will play it on those rainy days when they good chill-out music to match the dreary mood.

B00008HCCF|3.0|Not sure what all the fuss is about Norah Jones!  I rented this DVD after listening to her album a few times and feel that one viewing is enough (as another reviewer also stated).  She comes across very nervous on stage, and there is very little talking from her.  There are some added bonuses on the DVD including &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot;.  Now, I really love this song - but no-one does it quite like Eva Cassidy.
B0000029DD|5.0|The songs in this album have a beautiful heaviness, that demand introspection and soul-searching. Jeff Buckley's voice was absolutely perfect. He sprung every word out with a soft venom, that indeed, could kill you softly. <BR>I dont remember how I discovered this album, in fact, I dont believe i've ever heard mention of him on TV or Radio; which is a crime, because this album is a miracle. However I got this album in my collection, I'm so thankful I did. I hope it materializes into your collections somehow also. But if it doesn't, you should find some extra cash and buy it immediatley. It'll send goosebumps down your spine when your hear it.
B000066NW0|1.0|i will give avril this, she has a very good voice, but come on.  i hate how this is marketed as 'punk'.  if this is punk, then someone kill me.  now.  avril was originally supposed to be a country artist, but the record companies realized they could make more money with punk, that should tell you something.  and she doesn't even listen to good punk.  blink 182 and boxcar racer are not what i consider punk.  all you out there, do yourselves a favor and check out dead kennedys, nirvana, the clash, and the misfits.
B000002UAO|5.0|It seams that some are confused as to why this album has a slightly different song lineup then the old capitol version- this version was the version that was released around the world,EXCEPT in America,which got a chopped up version till this was released in 1987,replacing the old version.I must say I like this version better...great stuff to be found here.
B000089A07|1.0|Please stop the hype! This film is a bomb. It stinks. Edward (Hero of the Chin-less) Norton's mannerisms resemble those of the feeble post-altheimers Ronald Reagan and not those of an F.B.I. agent. How can writers give Norton a line like &quot;put a cap in your ass&quot; and allow him to have that mousy mug under poorly dyed blond hair. Please! Silence of the Lambs set the bar way to high for these filmmakers. Like the audience who went out to see this junk, they should have stayed home.

B00004X01U|3.0|I am a truly Madonna fan since my early childhood, I practicly grew up listening to her music, she has influenced much of my life, but I still think it's unfair that people keep on saying that this is Madonna's best ever. For me, it's not bad, but this is the record that I like the less, specially after listening to 1997's masterpiece &quot;Ray of light&quot;.<br />When I first bought this, I was expecting a more mature album, with great lyrics like what she had done in the mentioned &quot;Ray of light&quot; and great stuff like Erotica's &quot;side A&quot;. But no, what I found here is a childlike &quot;Britney-Spears wanna be&quot; album, totally denying her past and majesty. It sounded like Madonna wanted to fit in the new beats and not like she actually imposed them.<br />After listening to hew new album: &quot;American life&quot;, and not taking into account all the criticism about it, I can conclude that even thought it is clearly a &quot;follow up&quot; to Music, it is so much more subjective, so much more emotive and so much smarter. Tracks like &quot;American life&quot; or &quot;Hollywood&quot; are simply adictive (specially the remixes, that place Madonna as the new electronica queen), even though things like &quot;Easy ride&quot; are not so easy for the ear.<br />There are certain rescuable things about &quot;Music&quot; anyway, like the emotive moments of &quot;Gone&quot; and &quot;I deserve it&quot; or the animated &quot;Amazing&quot;, but &quot;Impressive instant&quot;, &quot;Runaway lover&quot;, &quot;Don't tell me&quot;, &quot;Paradise&quot; and the title track are simply to be forgotten.<br />So, if you're new to Madonna and want to get the real vibe of her, go get Erotica, Bedtime stories or Madonna's best ever: Like a prayer. There, you will get to know what Madonna is, not here.<br />Regards.

B0000AFQS0|5.0|I never had to suffer the VHS 'TKAA' (which by all accounts is &quot;flipping lousy&quot;), as I had a Betamax recording of the theatrical release (no omissions) that was shown on a UHF pay-per-view service (c. 1980); of course, the sound wasn't so hot, as Beta Hi-Fi wasn't to be for another 15 years.  I'd always watch it straight through -- never pausing, stopping, cueing, or reviewing, hoping to preserve it till they invented what I'd imagined would be &quot;recordable video CDs&quot; or something.<BR>  So, I bought a DVD recorder to save it with, though time [20+ yrs.] had taken its toll on the videocassette anyway (shock, horror) and then only a few months later they release this 'restored' DVD.<BR>  I'm glad to have the stereo sound, now.<BR>  I'm sure it's a real treat to see for somebody who hasn't seen it at all in all this time (Roger), as well as for those who put up with the VHS-trash (pity.)<BR>  So, now, I can crank it, and go back and look at thus &amp; such, and pick &amp; choose, too.  Splendid.
B00005JM0B|3.0|With a flash of light and a large burst of energy, a visitor from another time has arrived in Beverly Hills and death and destruction will follow in her wake.<br /><br />Such is the premise for the new Arnold Schwarzenegger epic, \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,\\" by director Jonathan Mostow, who takes over the big shoes left by the series creator James Cameron. The visitor is the deadly T-X (Kristanna Loken), a cyborg killer sent from the future to accomplish what the cyborgs in the previous two films could not - kill John Connor, and ensure that machines rule the world.<br />To accomplish this, she must first locate the elusive John Connor (Nick Stahl), who lives as a blip on society with no home, records, nor attachments to track him by. John is haunted by the visions of what his late mother Sarah told him about pending nuclear devastation and his destiny to lead the surviving humans to victory over the machines that would eradicate them.<br />With their very future at stake, the humans from the future have dispatched a second Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to locate and protect John from the T-X. The issue with this is that the second Terminator (the T-800) is an obsolete model and is no match for the vastly superior T-X who aside from being a killer has the ability to mimic other forms and control all manner of machinery.<br />Eventually John meets up with a vet named Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), a lady he knew as a child and who has wondered where he has vanished to ten years after his foster parents were found dead while his mother escaped from the institute where she was incarcerated. Kate has been planning a wedding when John comes back into her life and their reunion is hampered by the arrival of the T-X and the T-800, who turn the small vet clinic where John had been hiding into a war zone.<br />Kate, who is convinced she is being kidnapped, is taken from the scene by John and the Terminator as they attempt to leave the city and reach safety, as it seems the T-X is not the only pending threat to humanity, but Kate's father may hold a key to survival. It seems that the elder Brewster is a General in charge of a computer network known as \\"Skynet,\\" and with a virus on the loose in the nation's systems, Skynet may have to be activated to control vital defense systems. It is at this point that the film shifts into overdrive, as a series of action and chase sequences ensue (including a spectacular car chase involving a gigantic crane as John and Kate attempt to save the world and themselves from death and total devastation).<br />To say the film is action packed would be an understatement, as Schwarzenegger is at the top of his game and once again shows that he is the top action star in the world and despite some recent setbacks, at 54 he is still king of the hill. His Terminator blends action and humor without ever losing his sense of brutal efficiency and determination to complete his mission no matter what the cost.<br />Stahl and Danes have good chemistry with one another and are elevated beyond the typical characters in distress role. Stahl plays Connor as a lonely man who is unsure of his destiny and is haunted by the notion that he is to be the savior of humanity, as he feels he can barely take care of himself. However, when the chips are down, Connor, like Brewster, finds an inner fire and strength that will ensure their place in history when their destinies arrive.<br />One of the biggest surprises in the film is that of Loken, as she plays the T-X with a mix of brutality and sensuality. Unlike Robert Patrick's chilling turn as the T-1000 in the last film, Loken plays the T-X as a deadly and brutal killer who takes satisfaction in her tasks, but is not above a dry sense of humor and a sense of style and fashion. She is beauty and the beast in one and is easily a match for Arnold's Terminator. Loken mixes a quiet intensity with a steel gaze as she dispatches those in her way only showing any hint of emotion when she is killing like a predatory cat toying with her prey.<br />The special effects in the film are solid and Stan Winston once again shows off his skills, as the designs of the machines are first-rate. The action is relentless and it is nice to see that real stunts were used for many sequences instead of being created by CGI, thus giving a sense of reality and unforced spectacle to the action that recent films such as \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" and \\"Hulk\\" seemed to lack.<br />This is not to say that T3 is goes without issues. The film does not have the depth of story and the emotional attachment that the previous two films had, and character development is mostly nodded at as much of the premise was established in the previous films. I can see how some will take it one way and others will find issues with it differing from the original and perhaps the ending of the film.<br />I prefer to look at the film as an enjoyable summer film; it is entertaining, continues a great series, and is easily the most satisfying and entertaining of the summer blockbusters. And I do not think I am going out on a limb by saying that the Terminator will be back.<br /><br />Gareth Von Kallenbach<br />[...]n she is killing like a predatory cat toying with her prey.<br />The special effects in the film are solid and Stan Winston once again shows off his skills, as the designs of the machines are first-rate.

0375713751|5.0|Frankly, I'm not sure how Allison Pearson, a British journalist with two kids, managed to write this novel --- it's clear from her account that time is the scarcest commodity in a working mother's life and that the word multitasking doesn't even begin to cover the controlled chaos she oversees.<br />In any case, I'm glad she did write it, even though my working-mother days are over (and were never exactly desperate, given three stepchildren well past toddlerhood and a husband accustomed to being in charge). The story of Kate Reddy, financial whiz in The City (the British equivalent of Wall Street) and mother of two, is terrifically quick, amusing and (to use a dreadfully outdated term) right-on. Discussing gender equality with her reluctant male coworkers, she feels \\"like a vegan at an abbatoir.\\" Visiting her Yorkshire in-laws, she realizes that whereas at work they think she's \\"deviant for having a life outside the office,\\" people here think she's \\"a freak for having a job instead of a life.\\"<br />Kate's breezy ironic tone and madcap escapades make her a Bridget Jones for working mothers, but I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT aspires to be more than high-level Chick Lit. Although it may not be exactly literary, it is emphatically literate and breathlessly clever (especially the emails between Kate and her female friends, and Kate and the American client who becomes a sort of virtual lover). Further, it is almost sociological in its depiction of a late twentieth-century female so keen to be the perfect mom as well as the perfect career woman that she fakes homemade pies and jams with store-bought. Kate is a self-described double agent (\\"[We] lie for a living\\") dashing back and forth --- mentally as well as physically --- between her job and her kids, with a lunge at her husband now and then, guilty and angry most of the time. Every chapter ends with a MUST REMEMBER list --- Kate's crazed/hilarious/poignant messages to herself as she attempts over and over (in vain) to get a handle on the competing sectors of her life.<br />Now this material isn't exactly new. I'm not talking about Kate as a close relation of Bridget Jones; I'm talking about her as a descendant of the feminism of the '60s and '70s, with its rage over the double standard (nailed beautifully by Pearson in a scene in which a male colleague of Kate's leaves early for a child's swimming event and is practically deified); its identification of the double burden of housework/child care on top of one's professional duties; its insistence (as in Betty Friedan's THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE) that women need and deserve jobs outside the home; its riveting novels (MEMOIRS OF AN EX-PROM QUEEN; FEAR OF FLYING) that made every woman who read them feel, at last, that her predicament was recognized and her anger validated.<br />True, I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT is stylistically distinct from these feminist forebears, with many of the typical features of recent popular fiction (brand names, email screwups, househusbands, nannies), and Kate has a more brilliant career than most women could aspire to 30 years ago. But the issues are basically the same. This is depressing news, and in fact there is a wistfulness to Kate Reddy's story despite the comedy --- a deep-down sadness that suggests the working-mother dilemma is not really capable of solution. Someone always loses.<br />Pearson is wonderfully skillful at recreating the tension when parents socialize with childless couples (Kate has one of this species for Sunday lunch, and everything that can go wrong of course does), or when mothers with careers encounter mothers who make a career of motherhood (a group she identifies as \\"the Muffia --- the powerful stay-at-home cabal of organized mums\\").<br />She also manages a particularly difficult trick: telling the truth about men without launching into petulant tirades against them. She has Good Guys in the book (Kate's husband, a friend from work, her American client), though there are many more crassly chauvinist ones. But Kate's basic take on gender relations is bitterly realistic. Growing up working-class in the North of England, with a feckless dad and self-sacrificing mum, she realizes that \\"although the men ... took all the leading roles, it was the women who were running the show.\\" \\"... It was a matriarchy pretending to be a patriarchy to keep the lads happy. I always thought that was because where I came from people didn't get much of an education. Now I think that's what the whole world's like, only some places hide it better than others.\\"<br />Despite such grim moments --- and because of them, too --- this book was always a sharp pleasure to read. I made it last as long as I could, but eventually I finished, and Kate Reddy's candid, yearning voice vanished from my daily commute. I am bereft. Hurry up and write another one, Allison Pearson!<br />Meanwhile, if you are now or ever have been a working mother, you need I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT --- to make you feel less guilty and alone, and to make you laugh (and cry) in rueful self-recognition.<br />   --- Reviewed by Kathy Weissman

B00000099Y|5.0|If you are reading this and considering whether you should buy this cd, let me just tell you, that you will not in anyway be disappointed. If you have listened to any of tools previous or later albums than you know what to expect sound wise, but there is something special about this cd. the lyrics are touching and deep, while the acoustics are out of this world. when these two combine in the cd it creates something incredable. For me, i listened to lateralus first before I ever heard Anemia, so when i first listened to it, it didn't seem like anything special, but after a couple days of listening the songs start to take there course and you get hooked. I mean honest to god i have only listened to one other band in six months and have listend to tool, every day for half a year, and i am still aw-struck evertime i listen to it. also for me, i am not very impressed with new age music ( i like 70's,80's rock mostly) but tool is BY FAR my favorite band ever.<BR>    I was going to do a song by song review, but then i started thinking about and realized that almost every song would be #1, honestly there is not a single bad or average song on the whole cd. <BR>   If you listen to Anemia and like it, consider listening to undertow also. everyone says lateralus is tool;s second best album, but i think undertow is second and lateralus is third. undertow sounds more similar to anemia.
B000002UA9|5.0|As a child of just 6 years old at the time, the music of The Beatles had a major impact on my life and continues to do so over 40 years later. Recorded in very short time - 12 hours \\"Please, Please Me\\" is a remarkable album that captures the spirit and vibrance of 4 working class guys just wanting to make music together. At the time Producer George Martin decided to record their stage act as it was then. Contrary to Tony Barrow's album liner notes at the time, Lennon-McCartney DIDN'T have enough songs tucked away to last till 1975! Hence the 6 cover versions of songs by artists (some obscure) that were major influences on the boys at the time...Motown, Girl Groups (Shirelles, Donays etc), Arthur Alexander and Isley Brothers among others. (Except for \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", they would continue to record covers up until the \\"Help!\\" album).   Of The 8 originals, 4 tracks, the title song, \\"P.S. I Love You\\", \\"Ask Me Why\\" and \\"Love Me Do\\" had been released on the 2 previous singles though the last-mentioned song was remade for the album. The opener, \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" still stands, over 40 years later, as one of music history's supreme rockers and sets the tone for the rest of the album. \\"Twist & Shout\\" is John Lennon's \\"one-take wonder\\". A remarkable performance, you can hear a flu-ridden  John tear shreds off his voice as he puts everything into the lead vocal. It's little wonder they recorded this track last. The quality this first Beatles LP is all the more remarkable given the short recording time allowed...EMI still weren't prepared to invest too much time in a relatively new group despite the huge success of the \\"Please, Please Me\\" single in the UK. However that would soon change to the point that the band would start pushing the envelope and stretch what were once normal studio limitations. The best was yet to come...and then some!  This CD (and the next 3 albums) were remastered and released in Mono and it sounds all the better for it. The audio quality ofall Beatles albums was never in question though thanks to George Martin. Remember stereo was pretty much an afterthought in 1963, mainly to be used on Classical and jazz recordings.  As a starting point for new fans, I recommend this album as a wonderful testament to how joyful and exuberant music can be. It will also bring tears of joy to those that grew up with these guys and want to revisit the music of the Beatles.
0142002038|3.0|The sixth 007 book finds James Bond recuperating from the near-fatal events of From Russia With Love. M sends his on a seemingly easy mission to Jamaica to find out what happened to the missing station head and his secretary. As one might expect, there's more there than meets the eye, and Bond ends up facing off with one of the more memorable villains of the series. Soon after arriving, Bond's cover is blown and an attempt is made on his life, which is easily traced back to the mysterious guano magnate, Dr. Julius No. Bond teams up with his old pal Quarrel to infiltrate No's private island and poke about. As per usual, it's not long before Bond comes across a beautiful wild girl who will be at his side the rest of the story and end up in his bed. Honey is a truly ridiculous character, part untamed Amazon, part innocent schoolgirl, part nubile supermodel, all male fantasy (more so than usual, even for the Bond books!).<br />Once the dynamic trio is teamed up, it's not long before they're bumbling their way into the arms of Dr. No's professional henchmen. Bond makes elementary mistake after mistake, achieving something along the lines of his own personal Bay of Pigs in the showdown with the dreaded &quot;dragon&quot;. Once in the (inevitable) clutches of the hook-handed Dr. No, things get even more silly. First, the villain reveals his entire nefarious operation to Bond (because he's an egomaniac and needs his audience), which Bond had no previous idea about. Then, after gleefully telling Bond and the girl about how he liked to conduct scientific tests of human &quot;will to live&quot;, and conveying them to his own deadly obstacle course, he doesn't even bother to observe his little experiment! Instead, he wanders off to supervise some guano loading operation! This, of course, leaves Bond free to devise an escape (after a particularly groan-inducing battle with a giant octopus), and take revenge in a scene is so bad that it's unintentionally funny.<br />In the end, this is one adventure where Bond's toughness proves more useful than any brains r training. The descriptive writing is quite good, as Fleming places the reader right into the pristine beaches, smoky nightclubs, and fetid swamps. But it's a shame the plotting and internal logic wasn't tightened up, and the the supporting cast wasn't a bit more interesting. Quarrel is a stereotypically drawn islander, rough, tough, and lovin' the ladies, while Honey is a walking fantasy who has Bond swinging back and forth between father-figure and sexual instructor.

0913866156|5.0|As the other reviewers have said, the cards are indeed large, and it's not an exclusivity of people with small hands to have trouble shuffling them: I have very large hands and have trouble myself. But it's just a matter of getting used to the cards. There are proper ways to shuffle them, and you'll get along fine regardless of the size of your hands.<br />Regarding the colors, this deck (printed in Belgium by AGM) is not the older green tinted one, which came in a discreet white box with the OTO sigil on the cover. I haven't seen the smaller deck, the one in the lavender box (which Amazon does not carry), so colors might be fainter in this bigger version of the deck. But believe me, the cards look great. If they look better in the smaller deck, then I definitely need to order the lavender box.<br />I'm not going to review the deck itself, since there are plenty of good reviews around. I'll only note that as far as I'm concerned, the advice for not picking it up if you're new to tarot was pretty much off the target. This is my first deck, and I'm doing great with it, thank you very much. Buy it if you feel it's the right one for you.

B000002897|5.0|I had read and been told by my friends that the Screaming Trees were one of the most underrated bands of the 90's. I didn't know how right they all were until I listened to this album. Sweet Oblivion is just, well, amazing. It should have made the Screaming Trees a house hold name just as 'Ten' did for Pearl Jam, and 'Nevermind' did for Nirvana. The Screaming Trees put the right blend of mellowness with rock so Sweet Oblivion never becomes boaring. <BR>  Everything in this album works, there are extras added into the background of songs that acompany the music so well whether it is tamborine in 'Dollar Bill' or organ in 'Nearly Lost You'   <BR>  I must say that Mark Lanegan has a unique voice that can be so soothing yet still rock at the same time, it's sort of haunting. You may have heard him doing vocals on the Queens of the Stone Age albums 'R' and 'Songs for the Deaf'. He also co-wrote a few of the songs on 'Songs for the Deaf' such as 'No One Knows'(he can be see in the video for this song as the guy in the jeep with the hat on I think he's in the middle). Oddly this is also the name of a song he wrote on Sweet Oblivion. But don't think that these songs are the same because THEY AREN'T, the QOTSA version is heavier with different music and lyrics. The version on Sweet Oblivion is softer and more like a ballad but still nontheless a great song.<BR>  Truthfully I will admit that the first few times I listened to the album I didn't think it was amazing, it wasn't bad but it wasn't completely great either. After listening to it for a little while I got a chance to really see how great this album is. Sweet Oblivion is a masterpiece and will stay in my CD collection for years to come.

B000002A46|5.0|This album is one of Mariah's best collection of songs. It's veiled as a Christmas album yet features some of her best vocal performances. This came out in '94 at the heighth of Mariah's career. She was coming off of the &quot;Music Box&quot; album which was the biggest of her career. It consists of classic Christmas carols (Silent Night, O Holy Night, Hark the Herald Angels Sing) and Mariah originals (All I Want For Christmas Is You, Miss You Most, Jesus Born On this Day.) &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot; is classic Mariah carey. Upbeat, light-hearted, and fun, this is the kinda song you blast. It ranks right up there with &quot;Dreamlover&quot; and &quot;Fantasy.&quot; One listen to &quot;O Holy Night&quot; leaves you dumbfounded. Mariah puts so much emotion into the song and I love the high note at the most dramatic part of the song. No one has EVER sang this song better. &quot;Miss You Most&quot; is a beautiful ballad. &quot;Jesus, O what A wonderful Child&quot; will make you feel like you're in a Baptist church. This song proves what an incredible gospel singer Mariah can be.<br />Strip Mariah of her image, her sexy clothes, and numerous pop/ R&amp;B hits and this album showcases two important things. Mariah can sing like no other and has a strong grasp on her faith. This si the best holiday album money can buy. Whether you like mariah or not, there's no denying this album and all it stands for.
B000003S0F|4.0|In 1971, after three albums, Robert Fripp put out what has been the 'jazziest' effort to date, something that strikes most people as odd, since they are not a jazz band, but a prog rock band. They've been blamed for having recorded in this album a work that is not any of the above, but I differ from those opinions. Having got myself deeper into jazz lately, I can appreciate what Fripp's ensemble set out to do and accomplished here. Though I can agree this is not their best musical endeavor, I love it for what it is and the sound they accomplished, once again reinventing themselves and the genre.<br />As would become the norm in KC's history, Fripp brought in some new musicians (a couple from previous records, like his long-time 'words, sounds and visions' companion, Pete Sinfield) to materialize his new musical vision. Boz Burrell took care of the bass and vocals, for the most part: not your Greg Lake from the first two, or up to par with Mel Collins, who also repeats on this one on vocals and sax, but far from poor, as some other reviewer argues. Ian Wallace works on percussion and drums, not an easy endeavor on this one, given the varied time signatures Fripp explores. A few other featured players complement the base quintet to create an album that is rather to the left of most Crimson works, but one that will keep you interested if you give it a try.
B0000027RL|4.0|I am, by no means a grunge fan. In fact, my main music preferences are the complete opposite. Yet, there's no denying &quot;Ten&quot; as a powerful collection of songs. Eddie Vedder's emotional and often times wailing vocals are captivating.<br />My favorite track and what initionally caused me to purchase the album is &quot;Alive.&quot; It's a dark song, yet has such a great and catchy chorus, it's hard not to like it. &quot;Even Flow&quot; is another song that jumps out. The first line tells you that the whole song is gonna rock. &quot;Jeremy&quot; is probably the most famous song. Its infamous music video will forever be associated with Pearl Jam. The song is very powerful. &quot;Black&quot; is a bit slower but still a highlight. I personally don't care for tracks 7-10 as much although I don't mind &quot;Garden.&quot; The album closes with another stand-out track, though. &quot;Release&quot; is another awesome song that gets your attention. <br />This album will helped to start the whole grunge movement and is probably the best work that the whole genre produced *of course, Nirvana fans will disagree.* 12 million copies sold later, I think the music speaks for itself.
B000002LIX|5.0|Jane's Addiction have had many albums, some successful, some not so much. But after hearing most of them, i feel that none of them compare in the slightest to 'Ritual'.<BR>On my first listen, i instantly knew that this album would stay with me for a long time. Every song has its own distinctive qualities. Here is how I rate each one:<br />1. Stop- Amazing anthem, 5/5<BR>2. No One's Leaving- Excellent rock song 5/5<BR>3. Aint no Right- Emotional yet Heavy 4/5<BR>4. Obvious- Really Good meaningful song 4/5<br />5. Been Caught Stealing- Great,Upbeat Song- 5/5<BR>6. Three Days- This is the song that makes this album. It has made me cry in the past. SUPERB- 6/5!!<BR>7. Then She Did..- Great emotional Track- 4/5<BR>8. Of Course- My least favourite on the album, although still good.- 3/5<BR>9. Classic Girl- Excellent song, with meaning- 5/5<br />Please note that most of these ratings have gone down, because I have listened to this album so much! On the first listen, every track was 100% for me.<BR>This album is the first album that i am sure that I will never tire of. So please, even if you are not a fan of Jane's Addiction GET THIS ALBUM!!! You have not lived until you have heard it.
B0000CABJ1|2.0|Donna Summer seems to be suffering from a major lack of career confidence.  In the past 15 years, she has relied on numerous \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilations.  She has not released a full record of news songs since the 1991 bomb, MISTAKEN IDENTITY. Summer likes to tease her fans by slipping in a new song or two so that they'll buy yet another \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection just to be able to get that new track.  It's a formula that's worked for her ever since the 1980's ON THE RADIO record - another greatest hits with a couple of new tracks.  It's a miserly way to treat fans - whether it be Summer herself or her record company. Summer, who used to be an innovator in pop music in the 70's and 80's, is now left to having her old music remixed on an annual basis to a new club audience or leaking out some me-too tracks.  THE JOURNEY is another example of Summer's musical tease.  <br />From a price point of view, THE JOURNEY is a nice buy - 20 tracks - 18 of which are her hits of yesteryear - plus 2 new tracks and a bonus CD of extended remixes which includes one more new dance track. So, you get 3 new tracks in total! It's a cruel game she's playing - 18 tracks which were available on practically any of her other greatest hits compilations to get these 3 tracks.  2 new songs are produced by her longtime partner, Giorgio Moroder.  \\"That's the Way\\", written by Moroder and another longtime Summer collaborator, is a nice reggae-flavored song that compliments Summer's career maturity. She's no longer the 20-something or 30-something or 40-something diva singing about lust. It's a bouncy relaxed number about resignation. \\"I Will Live For Love\\", penned by Summer herself, is less successful. It's got that \\"written for a Disney movie\\" feel of optimism that complements Summer's born-again Christianity.  Another sign of a career's stagnation is that both Moroder-produced tracks have nothing particularly innovative about their sound. There is no trademark \\"Moroder\\" synthesizer - the tracksare pretty generically produced and arranged.<br />On the bonus CD is the much talked-about techno number \\"You're So Beautiful\\" (not to be confused with Christina's \\"Beautiful\\")  which is driving hypnotic number.  Unfortunately, it's more a piece of technological craftsmanship than anything that showcases Summer's vocals.  Anyone could sing that song and it would be exactly the same.<br />So is the JOURNEY worthwhile for 3 measly tracks?  Overall, I was disappointed.  Any fan's journey with Donna Summer has been one of heartbreak with precious little in new music.  It seems that Summer's career strategy has been to wait long enough until her music has come back around as nostalgia. Perhaps she's run out of steam or perhaps she's well-off enough that she's no longer interested in creating much music, but THE JOURNEY is a good case for music downloads.  How many times do we have to buy \\"Hot Stuff\\" just to get a new song every couple of years?  <br />Donna, record 3 new records so that you'll have more material for the next 15 years of \\"Greatest Hits Vol. 2\\"
0553328255|5.0|One of the most beloved collections of short stories and novels of all time was the product of the fertile imagination of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  In all, Doyle wrote 56 short stories and 4 novels starring the world's most famous detective.<br /><br />The short stories run about 20 pages apiece while the novels can run about 100. The total collection advertised here is around 1000 pages in length, divided into two paperback volumes in a slip case.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes inhabits a world that is fascinating to the reader. Dr. Watson stands in for the reader in expressing incredulity and admiration by turns. The stories have twists and turns that will keep you guessing, and keep you coming back for more.
0385504209|5.0|Wow, what a book.  I could not put it down and had to stay up until well past midnight to finish it!  Not only was it a great story, it was very thought provoking for me, too.  Although I am sure many of the &quot;facts&quot; were fiction, I really started to think about the role of women in religion and the concept of reconnecting with the feminine power within each of us.<br />It will take me a while to buy another of his books as I need a rest.  I was exhausted at the end from so much reading in such a short period of time!
B000002KAG|5.0|If you like the Dead or call yourself a &quot;dead head&quot; then you should buy this album . Overall it is a great album that shows what they were like in the early electric kool-aid days . The album has only one original song &quot;Cream puff war&quot; and other than that is songs based on blues standards ....Some of the albums high-points include Pig's harp playing on &quot;good morning little school girl&quot; and the 10 minute &quot;viola lee blues&quot; which is more or less a few verses , a chorus , and then a super long jam ...Some other reviewers have said one of the strangest aspects of this album is that every song is completely different from any material the band would record in their entire career (and it is). But its a great album that belongs in your collection... though might not be a album you want to show someone interested in what the Grateful Dead were like . For those of you that dont like their debut try to keep a open mind, this was recorded in 1967 when the band was trying to get away from the image of being &quot;the acid test house band&quot; . And also remember that this was their debut.

0062502182|4.0|Santiago's story is your story and my story. We all have dreams and \\"Personal Legends\\" that we need to fulfill. Like Santiago, some of us will venture into the unknown to fulfill their dreams while the rest will regard them as just dreams, nothing more and nothing less.<br />I really think reading this very short (shouldn't take more than 2-3 hours to read), sweet story makes us involuntarily examine our own lives. Full of philosophical, abstract concepts woven into an interesting plot, Santiago's trip to the Pyramids in search of his treasure is the microcosm of our daily lives. We need conviction, courage, faith and determination to survive every single day of our lives no matter how banal it might be.<br />I recommend reading this book if you are in the mood for a fast read that is entertaining and thought-provoking. The essence of the book can be summarized by the alchemist's words to Santiago, \\"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself.\\"
0066214122|4.0|Hand-in-hand with Crichton's oft-used &quot;don't mess with Mother Nature&quot; theme is the &quot;don't arrogantly mess with science we can't fully comprehend or control&quot; theme.<br />&quot;Prey&quot; has many of the same interesting elements that made so many of his previous novels so fascinating and gripping, but &quot;Prey&quot; also suffers from a weak and unsatisfying conclusion. I still enjoyed reading the story, but the chase scene at the conclusion felt like something from a generic TV movie.<br />Not that a (possible?) movie version would fare any better.  The Crichton novels that have been turned into feature films saw a lot of their scientific and moralistic edges softened considerably.  Too bad, too, because the films were much less interesting than the books as a result.<br />But is &quot;Prey&quot; worth a read?  Oh yeah.  And I anxiously look forward to his next book, whatever it will be.<br />By the way, Crichton is a pretty decent film director, too!!<br />Check out his films:  Runaway (w/Tom Selleck and Gene Simmons), Coma, The Great Train Robbery (w/Sean Connery), Westworld, and Looker.

This is not a technique to use without professional guidance.
0553275976|5.0|Is Bonfire of the Vanities a period piece? When reading a book from a previous time period, one might begin to ponder that very legitimate concern? It is, but it isn't.  Allow me to elucidate.  Bonfire garners irrepressible staying power as a scathing, sardonic, and witty treatise exposing the greed, glamour, decadence, and moral decay of the 80's not unlike The Roaring 20's of Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.  By no means is Bonfire in the same boat as Gatsby, but nonetheless, it's in the same ballpark, if you will.<br />Having never read Tom Wolfe before, I must say that I came away quite impressed and entertained by his singular ability to instantaneously transfer from one character's perspective to another at the drop of a dime(e.g. going from Reverend Bacon in the decrepit racially-charged milieu of The Bronx to Sherman McCoy in the plush comfortable confines of Park Avenue).  Wolfe's merciless satire and scathing cynicism lends itself to all of his eccentrically diverse motley cadre of characters.  As a testament to Wolfe's eclectic acumen, the author definitively nails the veritable cornucopia of targets ranging the gamut from the sheltered luxury apartments, entre nous lavish fetes of the social elite X-Rays of Park Avenue, the high-pressure environment of Sherman's Wall Street, the dog eat dog baseness of Vogel & co. at The Bronx PD and jail, the unmitigated political pandering of Weiss and Kramer at the DA's office, the Machiavellian glibness of Peter Fallow of The City Light, and, last but definitely not least, the self-serving specious \\"racial activism\\" of Reverend Bacon.<br />The vastly paradoxical upshot of it all is this my friends: Although this extraordinarily divergent melange of characters exists in strikingly unique socioeconomic environments, they all, however, undoubtedly contribute to the prodigious confluence of flagrant self-absorbtion, blatant egotism, deplorable moral degradation, pernicious greed, and the despicable venality that cryptically ties all of them together into one infinitely vacuous morally depraved vacuum categorically devoid of any semblance of moral absolutes.  Ahh...the irony of it all!  Wolfe's ingenious penchant for piquant characterization and witty dialogue makes for a smooth and fluid read that entertains as well as educates.  Bonfire IS a period piece, but it remains just as provocative today as it was upon its release.  Period(pardon the pun).<br />\\"A liberal is a conservative who has been arrested.\\"<br />- Sherman McCoy
0316666343|4.0|I really liked this book--it was extremely well-written, with beautiful language and exotic images--but there were two things about it which bothered me greatly. One, Sebold succumbs to a common fiction: when a child is killed or dies, it is the father who is steadfast and holds the family together; and it is the mother who goes off on a wild adventure, abandoning her remaining children. Suzy's parents, Jack and (I think?) Abbie fit that stereotype to a tee. Two, the whole Suzy-Ruth relationship is just HIGHLY unbelievable; in this book of bizarre things, I found it most improbable that a momentary encounter (be it even with a spirit) at the age of 13 can shape a person's whole life. Ruth's obsession with a long-dead classmate just did not make any sense to me. <br />Everything else was quite beautiful (yes, including the fact that Suzy takes revenge for herself), and the overall picture is of a kind and beautiful book that will leave you thinking, and perhaps, crying.
B00005JKC3|2.0|The Hulk is a movie by the great director Ang Lee (who again does an amazing job directing this movie) but due to a bad plot nearly all his efforts are in vain. This movie tries to have more susbtance and drama than action and killing. This seems like a great idea unless the plot you choose is so simple you couldn't even make an issue of a comic book of it. In the end the movie alienates itself from practically everyone because it doesn't have enough action to be classified as an action movie, and not enough substance to carry the movie past the slow parts. The reason I gave this movie two stars is because of the superb directing and formidable acting from Eric Bana (as the Hulk) and Jennifer Connelly.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|OK, folks, it's not Powerslave and it's not Somewhere in Time.  They are still Iron Maiden, though, and it still sounds freakin' awesome.  'Paschendale' is reminiscent of 'Seventh Son' and you almost can smell the mustard gas as it crawls toward the hapless souls in the trenches.  I actually hated the first single 'Wildest Dreams' when I first heard it on the radio, but it is actually growning on me.  The second tune on the album (can't recall the name) is pretty blistering, and the rest of the album provides a nice mix of music.  Some people don't like the three guitar attack, but I personally think it just adds a layer of depth to an already deep band.
0743457900|5.0|Like most of the best-selling works emanating from the unchallenged master of the intelligent spy thriller John LeCarre, this is in reality a fictional but absorbing treatise on the hidden and conflicted corners of the human heart, the many ways in which our own natures feed into and extend the darker impulse of a society bent on pursuing the secrets and treachery that ever lurks for the unsuspecting victim. Here, in the first of three best-selling novels tracing the pilgrim's progress of George Smiley, the intrepid and unlikely hero of the post-industrial Western world, LeCarre initiates his marvelously convoluted narrative tracing the continuing history of the Smiley chronicles, a spell-binding and endlessly intricate treatise detailing the perfidy, moral compromises, and treachery of the world of British intelligence.<br />In &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot;, once-cashiered intelligence expert George Smiley is called unofficially out of retirement to vet the suspects of passing British intelligence to the Russians by way of a deep-rooted mole with the Circus, the trade-name for British Intelligence. Once engaged, Smiley's ministrations are thrust toward unraveling the morass of conflicting evidence and false leads into a tapestry of meaningful clues. Much of the upper hierarchy within the Circus constitute the list of most likely suspects, so George has to proceed carefully, cautiously, and yet deliberately toward the truth, whatever it may be.<br />Given Smiley's past association and personal relationships with each of the protagonists, including one who cuckolded him by having a fling with George's now estranged wife, keeping the investigation on its deadly track is a delicate trick with many wild yet plausible and ingenious twists and turns. It is also the first of the several steps he must take to exact his revenge against the legendary Karla, the Chief of the Soviet Covert Espionage Bureau. So, as the he and his chosen covert investigation team begins to unravel the many points of light this careful sifting of signs through tradecraft, there is a number of levels of intelligence, motives, and intents all operating at once, and these LeCarre mines superbly in exploring the impulses rational and otherwise, that propel such urges.<br />The plot, as usual, is ingenious, intricate, and horrific in its human toll, played out against a landscape of the far-flung persons and places across the European landscape, from London to Berne to Deep inside the former Soviet Union. Once again LeCarre takes us on a cautious yet beautifully choreographed adventure into the heart of darkness of ourselves, and we shouldn't be surprised to find some scar tissue and broken bones as we descend deeper into the tortuous caverns we keep hidden in our subconscious realms. LeCarre is nothing if not a superb chronicler of the ways in which our own natures become a battle ground for the struggle between good and evil, the good we can be for others, and the evil we do to them and ourselves by subscribing to ideologies, almost any ideology, that finally forces us to choose between our values and our duty. This is a marvelous book, an entertaining read, and a stunning example of the sophistication, complexity, and sheer intelligence of the author in detailing the subterranean world of international espionage. Enjoy!gins to unravel the many points of light this careful sifting of signs through tradecraft, there is a number of levels of intelligence, motives, and intents all operating at once, and these LeCarre mines superbly in exploring the impulses rational and otherwise, that propel such urges. <br />The plot, as usual, is ingenious, intricate, and horrific in its human toll, played out against a landscape of the far-flung persons and places across the European landscape, from London to Berne to Deep inside the former Soviet Union.

B000099T2L|1.0|I love Beyonce's first two singles, &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot;!  So I decided to download this and hear the rest of the album, as I had high hopes for this release.  Really, I did!  And boy, was I disappointed.  The only other song that's single material is &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;.  &quot;Baby Boy&quot; is where the list of good tracks ends!!  The rest of the album is slow and repetitive.  I can't tell one song from the next, which is why I'm not doing a song-by-song analysis.  Instead of singing like with Destiny's Child and her first two singles on the solo album, she pulls a Mariah Carey and whisper sings the entire album!  Bottom line:  Wait for the next Destiny's Child album!!
B00000K19E|5.0|OMG, I saw this movie it was so awesome and it really made me think about our reality and could we really be controlled by machines. The special effects is awesome!!!!! I mean wow. It blew me away. I'm usually not a sci fi fan. But I was curious but now I am hooked. And I can see why Trinity fell for Neo! Neo or Keanu is hottt!!! I love the kung foo and the action scenes. Even though they r just alittle bit farfetched. But every guy I've talked to said it was awesome. You just have to pay close attention or else you will get lost but other than that is was awesome movie!!!!

B00003CX5P|5.0|I wouls have say, I enjoyed Episode 1 better than Epsiode 2. In the first one, it was basically all action. Episode 2 is more of a love story, less action. Plus, the new Anakin Skywalker looks too evil. Heh. Anyway, this DVD was awesome. Its totally my favorite movie.
0812550706|5.0|The Earth's fate rest in the hands of children leader amongst them Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggins. That is the extent of plt summary this review is going to get. This novel is periphally science fiction, but like the true masters before him Card uses a speculative setting to focus on humanity. I always felt the best sci-fi were humanistic novels that happened to contain extrateresstial or extraoridnary occurances. Ender's Game leads the pack. Card did such an intensely accurate job in his characterization, that I'm sure I am not alone in being choked up watching the government manipulate Ender for their own ends, but &quot;with the best of intentions&quot; Ender is a wholly three dimensional character as are his comrades whose training affects the fate of the earth. This novel is better I thought than his follow ups Speaker for the Dead Etc. And with Ender's Shadow series released(I haven't read it yet but its on my list) I know at least this past summer there was renewed interest in the original, and rightfully so. One of the best aspects about this novel is its universal appeal, my friend who doesn't read as a rule LOVED IT which says much about Card's talents.
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido's new cd, Life For Rent, is breattakingly beautiful in so many ways. The songs are all full of emotian and all have that soul stirring depth that we all grew so familiar with through NO ANGEL. This album is so much better in a lot of ways. There are a lot more trip-hop induced beats on this album than there were on her debut, and it all flows together in such a ethereal way. Stand Out songs to me are...<BR>Stoned-which has a more danceable feel to it-and the best way I would describe it to someone familiar with NO ANGEL would be to say it's along the same lines as the bonus track, TAKE MY HAND from that album. This may be my favorite song on this new album.<BR>Don't Leave Home-This song is beautiful...full of emotian and power. I love this song. I was blown away by this song the first time I heard it, and continue to be in awe of the way this song makes me feel.<BR>White Flag-The first single, and a truly amazing song. Very much from the same vein as HERE WITH ME. <BR>See The Sun-The last song on the album and containing a bonus track. A great song and definetly one I will be listening to over and over. <br />Overall-this album is truly a work of art in so many ways. Dido has beat the sophmore curse and created a follow up to something that was so amazing and unique that it was unlikely she could pull this one off! <BR>This album has something for everyone...Danceable emotive hits like Stoned...Powerful heart wrenching moments like WHITE FLAG, subtle ballads like the gentle MARY'S IN INDIA and trip hopping beats like those in SEE YOU WHEN YOU'RE 40.<BR>This album will be my favorite for a long time. BUY IT! YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!!!
B000069CWE|5.0|This album ROCKS!  Linkin Park is the best band ever and they have hit a new high with Reanimation.

B000003C5C|5.0|I cant tell you how much I love this legendary band.This maybe Death's finest hour in my view.All the tracks on this album are excellent to say the least and this album proves why they are the originators of the death metal genre.The songs are all heavy and fast,while throwing in killer riffs and solos.The cover artwork is awesome and the lyrics are intelligent themes about the real world.This band is right up there in the top next to bands like Napalm Death,Carcass,Obituary,Cannibal Corpse and Suffocation.Rest in peace Chuck Shuldiner,you are a true metal icon and will be sadly missed.GO OUT AND BUY THIS TODAY!!!
B000065BPB|5.0|Fantastic buy. Easily hold their own against my Grado SR80s. I like the circum-aural fit vs the supra-aural of the Grados. A bit heavier than I expected but not so much to be a problem. Easy to wear for many hours of listening. Good isolation and excellent build quality - absolutely no creaks from the moving parts. Recommended - especially at Amazon's low price!
B000003C2S|5.0|This album to put it plain and simple kicks butt.There are no filler songs on here,not even one.Some people complain that this album is slower than the previous efforts,but it's still relatively fast and more melodic than previous albums.This album is a must have for any fan of this legendary band.Chuck Shuldiner,your music and inspiration will forever be in my heart and the hearts of all your fans.BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
1400049628|3.0|You can see it in fine print on the back, next to the price.  &quot;Humor&quot;<br />This book doesn't really produce the kinds of laughs most of look for in books one might find in the Humor section.  It moves the reader instead to a king of amused admiration for the thoroughness of the parody.  Brooks does a good job of maintaining a consistently serious voice.  At first, I wasn't sure if it was parody or the writing of someone with, you know, issues.  His matter-of-fact cataloging of past Zombie &quot;incidents&quot; had me checking a few via google.com to see if he had based these on actual historical events!  The humor here is subtle and wry and not everyone will get it.  As some other review mentioned, it would be hard to beat this book as a Halloween gift.  I also thought of it as gift for a couple of friends of mine who are a bit too prone to take seriously conspiracy theories and paranormal silliness.
B000088E6D|5.0|While I was holidaying in Waikiki, cruising through Tower, I spotted this CD by Michael Buble, well it didn't come off our player in 2 weeks. When I returned to Sydney, I was pleased to see Buble was playing at 2 special sold out standing room only gigs at the Basement, which holds a couple of 100 people. He was truly amazing, the voice, the look, the schtik! including his take on Eminem and George Michael.<br />Unfortunately this is the last time you'll ever see this guy in a room this small, watch for him at Carnegie Hall, the new Centuries Sinatra, he has it all. Can't get enough of this man's music.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|It would have been hard to top Rufus Wainwright's last album, &quot;Poses.&quot;  However, this album is so different that it doesn't disappoint listeners by being a mere sequel. The music is brilliant--combining an orchestra of instruments that aren't heard much in modern pop, such as the harp and tuba. In songs like &quot;I Don't Know What It Is&quot; and &quot;Go or Go Away,&quot; Wainwright's energy and intensity really shine.  Less brooding and more caberet than his last album, Rufus has proven again that he can sing woderfully in a diverse range of styles and come up with consistently unique ideas. Rufus has the gift of elaborating on very personal, emotional themes without ever sounding trite.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|&quot;The Kids are Alright&quot; proves once and for all that The Who are the first punk band in music. Their lack of respect for anything and anyone is shown through out in this movie. From smashing instruments, to throwing pies at police officers, to ignoring the American Dream to simply &quot;conquer America because we're English&quot;, according to Pete, the Who demonstrate what set them apart from other acts of their era: the total lack of respect. this film is a must for anyone who wants to see punk in action.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|It may sound    a bit overstated   for some  people  but with the  dissapointing new releases  from mr. Sting and  Bowie   both released same  month It  may not sound  as  extremely  over stated  now does  it?  Even though  this record  may  not  live  up to  his  sophomore release  it  most certainly  is not  a  dissapointment  at  all.  It  is hard to  come out  with a  better record  after  you make  one that is truly  amazing. Every  artist  has  to face   a tragedy of  his or her  own  success. Rufus has   a  unique  voice and  style  of  music  which  is  rare  for  a  young artist these  days. I  must say that  some of  my  most favorite   records  of all  time  had to  actually grow  on me. It  takes   to  be in the right  mood  and  put  the head phones  on and  listen. Rufus  has  his own style and  I  do really  like that. How many artists  can stick  to their own ideas these  days. yes  even Rufus  agrees  that  he   had to  fight  the dissapointment  with  the limited audience  that is interested  in his music.  But good  music  is  not  for everyone. So  don't let the first spin  of this  cd  make you   give the final  judgement  about  this  album, because there  are  countles  of cd's  that wish  they could be same category  as this  one.  Unfortunatelly  pure trash  like  Beyonce and  Jessica Simpson  will sell  millions  more then   this  one.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|It goes deep and touches a myriad of emotions. It takes risks but still pumps and encites me to party up. &quot;I Want You&quot; is indecribably good and worth the album alone. Excellent choice of collaborators. It's the one thing that's keeping me moving right now.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I've waited a while to review Thirteenth Step....still assimilating it all. Remarkable album! Such vast contrast from one song to the next....on a par with Led Zeppelin 4, and should EASILY be considered a classic over time. <br />The Thirteenth Step stands apart from their first album Mer De Noms (another masterpiece), yet embraces the natural evolution any quality band would experience....much like the previous comment about Zeppelin from their earlier efforts to the 4th album (except APC didn't really &quot;borrow&quot; from Willie Dixon he he) and then even further evolved and peaking at Physical Graffiti. The Beatles definitely come to mind in this context, Pink Floyd as well... <br />I was privy to hear A Perfect Circle at Lollapalooza 2003...three weeks before The Thirteenth Step was even released and knew then and there I'd be listening to the second effort over and over again, just like their debut. 'The Nurse Who Loved Me' in a concert setting sounded awesome and really took from the first albums stylings, and then, when I heard it on the Album, immediately reminded me of the Rolling Stones 'Tears Go By'...and from the difference of the 2 versions, it shocked me...happily...on just how much APC nurtures and evolves its music. <br />The lyrics from 'Noose' smack of the hypocracy some people take when they find religion and think that since they are 'saved' are no longer accountable for prior actions in their own lives. The lyrics can be applied to more than a few people I know, but since I don't judge and despise being judged, I'll just keep those opinions to myself... <br />'Pet' was the first song they opened with at Palooza (actually, Lullaby preceded it and then flowed right into Pet....it's the exact opposite on the album you already know..), but again, the chilling lyrics you only begin to understand as you play any song more and more make it all the more eerie and hit very close to home...moral I take from it: NWO 4 Life unless you are part of the machine (...shepard or sheep...time to see Pulp Fiction again ;-). <br />Was a pleasant surprise to hear so many Rush undertones, and some Tool Undertow-nes(OUCH! DOH!) throughout the album as well, but with all of this diverse music going on within 1 album, it gave me an idea why A Perfect Circle is named A Perfect Circle (and this is only my best guess): It's because they are responsible for bringing many older styles of music into the fold with their own creations, and as Maynard said in concert 'bringing music into the 21st century...' thus completing A Perfect Circle. <br />Thank you APC for bestowing such a wonderful gift to your loyal listeners and to all who truly have a love and passion for music as a whole ;-D~. If you don't have it yet, RUN and get this album!!!!!!!!<br />Deciple X
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I love the extras on this DVD set, especially the isolated score and the piano tracks of Korngold playing many of the themes he composed at Warner. Documentary and other extras are great, and as usual Mr. Behlmer peovides interesting facts about the film and its historical context.<br />I will say that I actually prefer the film transfer that I have on a Criterion laserdisc. Purely a matter of taste, but the Criterion disc has much more vibrant color, and to me the color on this DVD appears to be a bit muted. I especially noticed this when looking at the stunningly beautiful Olivia de Havilland in the archery tournament sequence...the blue veil stands out much more in the laserdisc. She is so beautiful in that scene it almost hurts.<br />Aside from wishing the colors were a little more vibrant this is a fantastic set, well worth the wait. I can only hope that Errol Flynn's entire Warner Brothers work is released on DVD.
B0000AZJXQ|1.0|There is exactly one good song on this album: Track 07 &quot;The Outsider&quot;.  The rest is as boring and repetitive as, well...Tool's last album.  Lateralus was an entire CD of short, endlessly repeating guitar riffs--now just unplug the guitars and you have The Thirteenth Step. This album will have all but the most religiously devoted fans reaching for the fast-forward button.<br />Hey guys, how about writing som actual SONGS.  Remember those?  They had things like melodies and structure.  If I want more &quot;atmosphere&quot; I'll listen to Enya because she's better at it.  Maybe you could even write enough songs to fill one good album between both your groups.<br />It's intervention time for fans who know APC and Tool can do so much better.  Skip this CD or we'll see nothing more but the same lackluster stuff from these talented musicians.  Acquire Track 07 through other means...like recording it legally from the radio, for instance (since that's the ONLY way I know of to downlo...I mean get music). One good song should not cost $13.50.
B00008EY9G|5.0|Don't read many of these reviews, they give to much away to much of plot.<br />This is an excellent movie with the look of a 50's film, out in the desert, at one of those old motels,and it's raining like crazy,-----this is a great story.<br />I thought I had this all figured out I was wrong. You'll thnk thier doing Ten Little Indians---their not.<br />I wasn't sorry I bought this film.<br />That's just my opinion------I could be wrong.
6305426694|5.0|Having always been a John Travolta fan, I knew I would like this movie regardless of its topic.  However, just recently I had the opportunity to visit family who live directly across the street from one of the corporate buildings of the polluters and it made it all come to life for me.  I could envision those children being poisoned silently and the families not getting the kind of response they needed from the government, let alone someone to listen to them about the seriousness of the problem.  And to say it was a &quot;minor&quot; problem in history makes me wonder why the property nearby is a DEQ Superfund cleanup spot.<br />Too bad there aren't more being like Jan S. in our world today.
B00009RDG9|3.0|I enjoyed this film.<br />Interesting story, that has been done many times before, but is done again here in a way thats entertaining.<br />If you watch it worrying about weather someone could actually do these things you won't have fun. IT&quot;S FICTION!!! IT'S A STORRRY!!!<br />If you like macho action flicks, in a woodsy setting you'll like this film.<br />And a note to the animal nut one to two reviews before me. Their animals---they would and could kill and eat you. The only thing we have to worry about is managing resources so the last as long as possible for our use.
B000084T18|2.0|50 cent sucks.  this cd sucks.  only a couple good songs.  what a waste of money.  ill download his new stuff before i buy it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Anyone who says this album is bad is just plain wrong.  Its hard to find good mainstream music nowadays with artists like Justin Timberlake all over the place.  Radiohead keeps it real with OK computer
B000001FOL|5.0|I love this CD. I'm a big Velvet Underground fan, and if you're a huge fan of their first album and enjoy hearing Nico's voice (which a lot of people don't), you'll love this album. The music is just beautiful and poignant, and you won't be disappointed.
B000002V07|4.0|Mazzy is cool, sexy, sultry, quasi-emotional.<br />Mazzy is not deft.<br />Mazzy is chill music, mood music, quasi-music.<br />Mazzy is Mazzy.  It creates stories because you want stories to go so slow they never end, nor begin.<br />That is Mazzy.  Drugs or no.<br />So Tonight That I Might See the Blue Light in My Best Friend's Room.<br />Buy this CD if you are lost, wanting to be found.<br />What it is.<br />Matthew Hahn, [...]
0385512104|5.0|This is a wonderful and original mystery novel in which the protagonist is an autistic child albeit a &quot;mild&quot; case considering the continuim of the disease.  Anyone interested in the working of the mind and, in particular, autism should read this novel.  I recommend it highly and will be looking forward to the authors next offering.
B00000099Y|5.0|I'm not gonna write a whole 5 prargraph summary on this record. I will say, though, that this is an excellent CD and is Tool's best. Well worth the money spent.
B00006CXXU|5.0|her voice is so AMAZING!!!!!<BR>what more is there to say!!!!!!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I've heard many complaints about the length of particular scenes over and over again since I saw it in theater when it was on screen.  It is no doubt that some of the scenes are long, but everyone of them holds certain function in the movie.  Remember, the original idea of the Matrix is ONE 10 hr long film! so try to pay attention to the relevency of this to Matrix 1 rather than to the length of a single scene in a logically 1/3 of the film.  Some of the scenes which receive most criticism is the Zion dance, Neo VS Agent Smiths and those involves Neo's superman thing.  For the Zion dance, please pay attention to the atmosphere and the number of people present there in the cave, then refer to the news that \\"Zion is to be destroyed\\", notice the impact, notice the death of so many innocent people.  How can you notice the hugh number of people in Zion if they only show you a room or two or just the hovercraft lot.  For the fighting scene, please listen to the background music, it is just like a dance!!  It also needs a lot of skills to make a scene like that with all those variety of moves and directions.  For the superman things, if I'm not much mistaken Neo have only used it 4 times in the whole film: beginning, after the Smith fight, from the mountain, and rushing to save Trinity.  It helps in distinguishing Neo from others a lot and everytime he used it, it is an urgent situation or for safety.<br />One of the most attractive feature of the Matrix Trilogy is that there are so many quotes from scriptures and history!  So if you spend some time in researching for these quotes, just like I did, it would be a lot more fun.  P.S. Once you've got the DVD, try to pay attention on small stuffs, you will definitely find a lot more from it.
B00008EY9G|5.0|I don't know how to describe it. I understood it, and alot of details were thrown into it. Little things that you don't notice. My dad picked up most of them, but I didn't. Half way in the film I noticed one thing, then I figured out who did it. Still, the movie has alot of twists, things that project one answer, then something else happens. I guessed a number of theories, and they actually happened. I loved the beggining, then the middle was pretty good. The ending was rather crappy though.<br />Basically after an accident, some strangers run into each other. A convict with a man show up. I think its relatively easy to guess whos bad and who isn't in the film. The first murder is rather creepy, especially when it is discovered. The movie seems to go in a downward spiral, but is enough to keep you there. Even if the ending is slightly bad, it tells you everything you need to know about the one man.<br />Best thing about the movie? Details. There are so many details to pick out that will help you solve things. There are alot of things to speculate on also. Especially the introduction with the tape player and newspaper/photo stuff. <br />Acting? Great. Terrific roles. People did a great job of seeming real. I didn't like high fidelity, well I saw only 30 minutes of it after getting home, my parents didn't really like it though. However, John Cusack does a wonderful job in this, terrific. Every character does pretty great roles. The movie makes me ponder things, stuff that we never think about.<br />The disc we rented was terrible, kept skipping, but then we ran it again on my PS2 and it worked fine. It is relatively easy to figure out. Still, this movie has a scary atmosphere, some great twists, but all-in-all a bad ending. Like, I just hated it. The movie is basically not happening or something? Or is it? I'll let you speculate on that after you see it, but until then..... not everyone's identity is different.<BR>Overall---&gt;5 Stars<BR>           ___G®êà___
0790751216|5.0|Clint Eastwood appears - looms - in this gritty Western in the cowboy tradition of High Noon and Shane. Eastwood also directed Pale Rider, a movie in which he's known only as Preacher, because when he appears in town, he's wearing a clerical collar. Hard for the beleaguered miners (who are being terrorized by a smarmy land-grabbing tycoon and his band of local baddies) to figure out at first is whether Eastwood is a good guy or a bad guy. There's the requisite pretty woman and adoring child who belong to one of the miners, and it gives Eastwood to prove his intensions are high-minded.<BR>Classic Eastwood, classic cowboy, classic classic.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|In the fall of 2003, the doors at the mall were opened, and several set sail for the entertainment store. They came in search of CD's and DVD's. One of them found it in the 20th Anniversary Edition DVD of the 1983 classic Scarface... action, violence, and a story beyond his wildest dreams. He was Mr. Buckley. The store clerk will remember him by another name... THE GUY WHO BOUGHT SCARFACE.<br />At last, Scarface has found a home on DVD. So many are wondering, how does the anniversary edition hold up? Pretty damned well, I say. First of all, the picture looks great. On the old VHS copy, the picture looks kind of grainy (then again, we've had it in my house for as long as I can remember), but on the DVD, of course, it looks great. Second, the sound gives the action new life. Just listen to those shots going off! That 5.1 audio really lets you hear the blood splatter! Also, the extra features are great. Interviews, deleted scenes, hell, even contrasting the theatrical version with the TV version. You get a lot of goodies here.<br />Now, on to the movie itself. It's a masterpiece. Pure and simple. If you haven't seen this movie yet, shame on you. Go out NOW and BUY IT. Don't bother renting; BUY IT! Al Pacino pretty much gained his legend status by portraying Cuban refugee/drug kingpin Tony Montana, but Steve Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, and everybody else give awesome performances as well.<br />Make no mistake: this is NOT, I repeat, NOT a movie for the squeamish. If you are, stick to the Wiggles. But if you're not, and you want a fantastic movie that disturbs you, excites you, interests you, grabs a hold of your attention and does NOT let go for the entire 170 minutes, click the &quot;Buy Now&quot; button, and enjoy Scarface. I know you will.<br />So say goodnight to the review guy!
0140277447|1.0|First of all, I pray for all victims mentioned in this book.<br />   But may all the readers keep in mind that this book is just an elaborate propaganda against Japan.  The victims in the book were NOT killed by Japanese army BUT were killed by unorganized private Chinese armed gangsters, who were unfortunately very popular during the confusion in China.  On the contrary to stories in this book, a lot of Japanese were also killed in cruel way in Tong zhou Incident and more.<BR>   After WWII, Chinese government just fabricated odious stories that Japanese military were in charge of criminals as mentioned in this book.  One of the reasons is that People's Republic of China (current Chinese Government) has had to do with those gangsters very deep and hopeless way and they had to hide the truth and Chinese government took very mean way that they blamed the mass killings for Japanese military just contrary to the facts.  This is also used to control people by making a common enemy to make unity and hide what they really have been doing since WW2 until now (please remember Tiananmen massacre and what they are doing in Tibet and Uyghur).  What is more, they used their propaganda to take advantage to get financial aide as penance from Japanese governments.<BR>   There is a fact that the places under controlled by Japanese military were much safer than any other places in China, and the population in such places drastically increased even though it was during the war.  A lot of Chinese refugee came into there, while there were a lot of brutal beating and murder by Chinese gangsters.<BR>   Please do not be naive for dark politics and credulous if you will read this book.  There are a lot of emotional comments here but basically they allege the same things as the author of this book did.  I hope it will be the day when Japan will be totally exculpated and people will know the truth.
B00000J2SO|5.0|\\"Down to Earth\\" is probably Rainbow's most controversial album, and for only one reason: it was the first without founding vocalist Ronnie James Dio.     People who don't like the album - for the most part - just can't let go of Ronnie. He was replaced by Graham Bonnet and his unbelievable vocal pipes. Some people like Bonnet, others don't, but after Rainbow introduced him to the hard rock world, he went on to perform with such hard rock royalty as Michael Schenker, Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Vai, Chris Impelliteri and others.     And for me, Bonnet makes the album. He's got the craziest set of vocal chords you've ever heard, and I've since gone around collecting everything he's ever recorded (this was his only album with Rainbow).    But the rest of the album is equally excellent: it's got great melodies, clean production, and excellent musicianship. Some of the lyrics seem written by a hormone-crazed school boy, it's true, but a small weakness for eight solid, hard rock songs. Down to Earth is more consistent than the first three Rainbow albums, less commercial than the final three.     Had this been Rainbow's debut, or the debut by another band, it would have received kudos all around.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|For all the missing and poaning going on here, you'd swear that &quot;#1's&quot; was taken from a cassette tape someone had run over with a car. But fer cryin' out loud, it's THE BEATLES and some of the most amazing moments ever to be carved in a single line spiraling circle of black plastic in the history of sapiens kind. Plus the sound is better than almost any other Beatles CD since the originals started creeping out in the late 80's. There are 27 songs here and I defy anyone born between 1950 and 1970 to listen to this disc and not smile, have a flashback to a moment in time, or sing along with gusto. All the while keeping in mind that these five men (I include George Martin in my head count) did all of this in barely eight years!!! For those of us that haven't bothered to replace all our albums and 45's with little shiny silver discs (and there are a few of us left), &quot;#1's&quot; is a godsend, complete with a fun booklet of picture sleeves from other countries. To say that this collection is somehow musically defective is stepping just short of historical heresy and is outright nitpicking. Me, I am anxiously waiting for &quot;Sgt Peppers&quot; inevitable 5.1 remix.
B000099T2L|1.0|I think that this cd was a big mistake for beyonce. she could have done much better. her first song &quot;crazy in love&quot; is great. it all goes downhill from there. the duet with luther vandross was pretty good but if you want to buy this cd, it's a waste of your precious time and money! save yourself now!
0156027321|5.0|I think its a long time since I came along a book which made me reflect so much. I bought this book by chance coz i saw it in a local book store and immediately fancied the cover. I ordered it as soon as i switched on the pc. I had no idea what to expect and had heard or read nothing about it.  Its just superb. Its hard to describe to other persons. The way things are described is so overwhelming, that i had to stop at times and take deep breaths. The way Pi can transform the one thing that could delete him completely into a neccecity for survival is just undescribable.  The author manages to describe things so clearly you could just taste and feel all that is happening. I laughed and cried at the same time more then once. How life could transform you and make you adjust to anything, in order to survive is just amazing. Just order it and absorbe every sentence, every word. It is definately one of those books i will be returning to often and often. There are whole paragraphs i have read for more then a dozen times, just for pure pleasure. Its all about priorities. Its full of food for taught....its not just a book to read, but to have.
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido's voice never changes and will probably never will. However, this cd has some new beats that makes Dido voice unbelieveable. Her music is a little bit more rock edgy, but voice sooths it down. A strange but great combination.
B00008J4P5|4.0|This band is notorious for pumping out new albums left and/or right. And in most circumstances that ends up with half a$$ed albums that are just out for making an extra buck.  But that is never been so with the White Stripes. They are continually able to put out quality rock and roll. They picked a great single to get out on the radio with &quot;7 nation army&quot;, the song has a great riff that just sticks inside your brain for hours at a time.  Other quality tracks include &quot;Girl, You have no faith in medicine&quot; and &quot;Black math&quot;. If you are a fan of these pair of musicians then head out and hop on the Elephant.
B00007LTIC|3.0|Unless you're a fan of the 80's Trevor Rabin edition of Yes (the &quot;hard rock&quot; Yes as I refer to them), this is about the last stop for most of the bands original fans. This is a MUCH more commercial album than the band had made since probably &quot;Time And A Word&quot;, it was kind of Yes giving in, saying &quot;we're just gonna stop experimenting and make the kind of mainstream Yes albums that fans of &quot;Roundabout&quot; want&quot;.<br />Well, so they pack this album with the radio friendly hard rocking &quot;Roundabout&quot;-ish &quot;Parallels&quot; and the title track, and the short, pretty ballad &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot; (sure to get them radio play again after the difficult classic albums &quot;Relayer&quot; and &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot;).<br />Well it worked. They were once again a commercial force.<br />Matter of fact, I wouldn't even recommend this if it weren't for &quot;Turn Of The Century&quot;, one of the most amazingly beautiful, intense tracks of the bands history and the main reason for purchasing this. The closing track &quot;Awaken&quot; is just about the bands last attempt at an epic piece like those of their previous 3 albums. Although it contains a nice agressive guitar riff from Steve Howe, it just goes on and on ad nauseum for 15 minutes. It seems this was probably a shorter piece that the band just stretched out just to appease those fans of their previous albums and prevent them from crying &quot;sellout&quot;. Well, it doesn't work, not at least for 15 minutes and I hear more &quot;padding&quot; (As Rick Wakeman once referred to some of the stuff on &quot;Tales From Topographc Oceans&quot;)than on any of the 4 20-minute pieces from &quot;Topographic Oceans&quot;. Matter of fact even the weakest track from that album has more going on musicially than &quot;Awaken&quot; does.<br />Still, for fans for who want to hear a lighter version of Yes (and the sound of this album is quite good) than what is on &quot;Topographic Oceans&quot;, &quot;Relayer&quot;, or &quot;Close To The Edge&quot;, this is a decent place, although I actually prefer the bands first 2 albums &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;Time and A Word&quot;, with original (underrated) members Peter Banks on guitar and Tony Kaye on keyboards. Fans of 70's Yes should check those albums out, the track &quot;Survival&quot;, from the bands very first disc is still one of the most beautiful tracks ever done by Jon Anderson and Co.<br />After this, it was all downhill, &quot;Tormato&quot; was a distaster, &quot;Drama&quot; shouldn't even be considered a Yes album (since it was done without founding member Jon Anderson, but this album is just an example of how music biz accountants and greedy rich rock starts often get their way).<br />The Trevor Rabin edition followed &quot;Drama&quot; and this was not a band for the original fans of Yes at all. That was a new band for the MTV generation, but I suspect that fan base is long gone anyway.<br />The group that continues on to this day is a sad, pathetic group that should call it a day. Dont believe that the<br />hype surrounding the recent &quot;Keystudio&quot;, &quot;Magnification&quot;, or &quot;The Ladder&quot; (ALL of which were hyped as a &quot;remarkable return to the form of the 70's Yes&quot;)is even a little true.<br />Quite simply the only post &quot;Going For The One&quot; Yes album worth shelling out cash for is 1989's &quot;Anderson Bruford Wakeman &amp; Howe&quot; album done long ago. At least when they strayed from the 70's formula they came up with something listenable. I put the musical sucess of that album perhaps to being the first time that drummer/composer Bill Bruford returned to the fold (a much superior musican to Alan White who's held down the drum chair since about 1973 in the band). Too bad Bruford didn't stay with the band. He may have been able to kick them into a more musical place .<br />When one looks at the amazing number of albums Yes has put out,it can be a daunting task to select what to listen to. Well, fans, I say it's all pretty simple: if you like creative imaginitive music and can stand long instrumental sections, just look at the albums dates and don't buy anything recorded or released after 1978 by the band and you'll avoid all the trash that they've put out since then (the 1989 &quot;Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe being the ONLY exception)...ing task to select what to listen to.

B0000640S3|1.0|Big disappointment after the great Rambo ll. No thanks from the women of Afghanistan to Rambo for helping the Taliban take over! I was especially disappointed by the scene where Rambo gave the necklace to the little Al Quaeda kid. He got it from the dying Vietnamese female soldier in the previous movie, after he promised he'd never forget her! After she had saved his life helping free the American POWs! How soon he forgot! There are many reasons to hate &quot;Rambo lll&quot; but I think this one is the most memorable for me. Shortly after this movie was filmed, the Soviet Union retreated and Afghanistan fell to the same jihadists our troops are fighting there now. Afghan women have been liberated by the American troops after Rambo helped enslave them! Ironic, isn't it? I only wish Rambo would go back in a new movie and help revenge us for 9-11.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This album is awesome. Most of these reviews put down the album because it doesn't sound like their older stuff. These aren't fans of the band, a fan can respect whatever direction a band takes. It's not supposed to sound like the earlier material!!! This album has excellent solid guitar work, cool tempo changes, awesome solos, great songwriting, great lyrics, and of course Bruce soars on every song. The band sounds so good together, all the music blends perfectly as usual. This album is different than Number of the Beast, and Powerslave, etc., but it's a matured, developed, and for lack of better words, AWESOME kind of different. I love all the songs on this album. The only weak point on the album is the first song, but that's even a great song, just not as awesome as the rest. Pachendale is truly my favorite. Rainmaker, New Frontier, and Face in the Sand are also really high points. This album is truly magnificent just like every other Maiden album. I love it, and any fan will agree and not whine about stupid stuff. Just buy it!
B00003CXE7|5.0|In all respects, &quot;Gladiator&quot; is the perfect movie that should and does appeal to both men and women.  For the men there is no shortage of blood, guts and gore, from the opening battle sequence between the Roman Northern Army and the barbaric Germans to the exceptional scenes in the gladiator's arena.  For the women, of course, there's Russell Crowe.  For all, this exceptional epic silver screen masterpiece brings to life the intriguing story, filled with deception, deceit and heroic valor, of a Roman General who was on the precipice of becoming the Roman Emperor who then, by a twist of fate, became a slave and slave who became a gladiator and a gladiator who defied the Emperor himself.<br />Few movies, with the exception of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; can truly compare with the epic nature of this film that tells its tale with such intrigue and a truly compelling plot that will keep the viewer on the edge of their seat from the opening sequence to the end credits.<br />Russell Crowe deserves all of the praise and accolades he earned for this film.  He truly became Maximus for this film, in every aspect.  Joaquin Phoenix played the part of the mentally unstable Commodus to perfection and the ever beautiful Connie Nielsen as Lucilla performed brilliantly.  Richard Harris' brief but poignant appearance as Emperor Markus Aurelius serves quite poignantly in showing what a brilliant actor he was and his talents will be and are sorely missed in the film industry.<br />Director Ridley Scott who has brought forth such huge films as &quot;Alien,&quot; &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; shows his talents as an exceptional director quite brilliantly in this film and he deserves every last accolade he earned for this stunning and memorable film.  The score for the film matches perfectly with every scene, lending brilliantly to the mood and atmosphere.<br />The premise:<br />Russell Crowe is Maximus; the Roman Northern General who asthe film opens up is leading his army to the end of almost five years worth of campaigning against the barbaric Germans.  In a brilliant and exceptionally well choreographed epic battle scene, the Roman army defeats the Germans and the campaign is finally over.  Emperor Markus Aurelius is there to witness the final battle and he's more or less taken Maximus under his wing and thinks of him as his own son.<br />As Emperor Markus Aurelius knows he's dying he also knows that his only heir to the thrown, Commodus, is not a &quot;moral&quot; man and he doesn't wish for his powers as Caesar to pass to him.  He asks Maximus to take the thrown but Maximus has to think about it for all he's thought of during this long campaign is to returning home to his wife and son to be a farmer.  When Emperor Markus Aurelius tells his son Commodus that he will not be emperor, Commodus murders his father in a psychotic display lacking any true emotion for his father and conveying a more despicable outrage that he wouldn't be Caesar.<br />As Commodus' reward to Maximus for his many years of faithful allegiance to his father and to the Roman Empire, he asks Maximus but once to acknowledge him as Emperor and Maximus refuses; Commodus orders Maximus' wife and son murdered.  He then has Maximus led off by Praetorians to be executed.  As is Maximus' &quot;talent&quot; he is able to free himself from the Praetorians and begins the long journey home, only to find that his wife and son are dead.<br />Here is where this compelling story takes its surprising turn after Maximus buries his wife and son, he collapses on their graves, exhausted and depleted by the wound given him from one of the Praetorians.  He is picked up by slave traders and taken to the Middle East where he is sold to Proximo, played brilliantly by Oliver Reed in his final role.  Proximo is a former gladiator who fought his way to freedom and now runs his own games.<br />What follows from there is nothing short of one of the mostbrilliant and compelling epic stories to have ever been brought to the silver screen and DVD, in which Maximus, Roman General, becomes a slave and then a gladiator and ultimately the gladiator who challenged the Roman Emperor himself.<br />I highly recommend this masterpiece to any and all fans of this genre and who love what movie making is all about because &quot;Gladiator&quot; is one the &quot;definitive&quot; films of all time.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />- Director's commentary from Ridley Scott<BR>- Deleted Scenes, complete with Director's commentary<BR>- Treasure Chest:  A unique montage of additional footage cut to the powerful score<BR>- Interview with award winning composer Hans Zimmer on scoring the film<BR>- 2 Extraordinary Behind the Scenes Featurettes<BR>- One of a Kind production diary by young actor Spencer Treat Clark (&quot;Lucius&quot;)<BR>- Special slide show featuring concept art and storyboards<BR>- Photo gallery from Behind the Scenes of the &quot;Gladiator&quot; set<BR>- Theatrical trailer and TV spots<BR>- In depth production notes and detailed cast and filmmaker biographies
B000089RVR|5.0|If you enjoyed No Angel you'll definitely like this one. A much better album, Dido has extended her range and produced an album that is not quite as dark as her first one (at least I thought the first one was a bit dark).<br />Track 10 (See The Sun) is interesting because at the end of the song there's about 2 minute's of silence, then you get a bonus track.  There is no mention of this on the back cover or the booklet for the CD, however it's another great track.
B00005JKN9|3.0|\\"Gangs of New York\\" is the brutal tale based loosely on the real life events and people of New York City in the mid nineteenth century in which \\"natives,\\" or at least those born in the United States at the time, rebelled against immigrants and more specifically Irish immigrants who were coming to America in hopes of escaping the tyranny and famine there.  What greeted them here in the \\"land of the free\\" was poverty, dissent from the \\"natives\\" and forced enlistment in the Union Army to fight against the Confederacy.<br />In a city in which there was entirely too many people and the poor were forced into specific areas where those with money and the brawn to match it could easily take control and did, crime ran rampant, political corruption easily bought and open murder in the streets went unpunished, gangs were formed by groups to help stave these things off.  Ultimately, the gangs themselves became more the problem than the solution as they would wage open war upon one another in the streets and behind the scenes they were the masters of the corruption that made things worse for everybody but themselves.<br />While this film has been nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award for 2002 and it may very well win it, I would probably look elsewhere to give this award.  On the whole, this story carried fairly well and the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis was exceptional, I felt that this movie was more a series of displays of life in New York City at the time as opposed to carrying a compelling dramatic plot that drew the viewer into it.<br />As mentioned before, the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as the \\"Bill the Butcher\\" was nothing short of an Academy Award winning performance in which he totally became the character he was playing.  Leonardo DiCaprio has finally grown up and is no longer the skinny little kid from \\"Titanic\\" and his performance was \\"adequate\\" to the role, but again, there was little that compelled the viewer to his character.  Cameron Diaz, what canone say, she's the \\"girl next door\\" and her performance was \\"right on\\" with what I've seen of her in past films.  Liam Neeson makes an appearance at the beginning of the film that was classic Liam Neeson!<br />Director Martin Scorsese who has brought so many pivotal films to the silver screen over the years did a wonderful job of bringing this film to print with the story he had.  The score for the film matched the mood of the film exceptionally well.<br />The premise:<br />This film of vengeance and survival centers around the Five Points section of lower Manhattan in mid nineteenth century New York City.  Several gangs have been formed for the protection of its members.  In 1846, the Irish gang known as the Dead Rabbits, was led by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) who was doing everything he could for his people here in the new world.  As he leads his gang into battle against the \\"Native Americans,\\" led by Bill the Butcher, his son, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DeCaprio) watches from the sidelines as his father is brutally murdered by Bill the Butcher.<br />Young Amsterdam is taken off to be raised in incarceration and it is now 1862, and the United States of America is no longer \\"united\\" but embroiled in the bloody civil war.  Amsterdam is released from his incarceration and he heads home to the Five Points to exact his revenge for the death of his father.<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, a fairly decent movie that, for me, didn't quite live up to all the hype it received, but was still worth watching, if only for the \\"historical\\" value of it.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />Most interesting of all of the Special Features for this film is the Discovery Channel \\"Uncovering The Real Gangs of New York\\"<br />- Costume Design Featurette<BR>- Set Design Featurette<BR>- History of the Five Points Featurette<BR>- Exploring the Sets of \\"Gangs of New York\\" with multiple angles utilizing 360 degree shots of the sets<BR>- U2 Music Video \\"The Hands That Built America\\"<BR>- Discovery Channel \\"Uncovering The Real Gangs of New York\\"<BR>- The Five Points Study Guide: Luc Sante Introduction and Five Points vocabulary<BR>- Feature commentary with director Martin Scorsese<BR>- Theatrical Trailer<BR>- Teaser Trailer
B00008WT5M|4.0|After the straight-shooting classic that was &quot;Back in Black,&quot; AC/DC had a bumpy ride for much of the 1980s.  They continued to release solid albums, but their sales began to dip after 1981's &quot;For Those About to Rock We Salute You.&quot;  But 1990 was the year the Australian boys reclaimed the hard rock throne with their tough album &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; (hold the apostrophe).  That record blasted to Number Two and went multiplatinum in a year when folks like MC Hammer dominated the charts.  Produced by the late Bruce Fairbairn (who also worked with Bon Jovi, Poison, and Aerosmith), &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; may not be a classic, but it roars with energy and spunk.  Like any AC/DC record, this CD revolves around three themes: sex, drugs (with booze), and rock and roll.  The hits on this CD are the rousing &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; and the top 40 hit &quot;Moneytalks,&quot; but other killer cuts are the funny &quot;Got You By the Balls,&quot; &quot;Are You Ready,&quot; the ever-festive &quot;Mistress for Christmas,&quot; and &quot;Fire Your Guns.&quot;  Like Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, Fairbairn's production is a bit on the polished side, but it doesn't compromise AC/DC's sound.  Angus Young's guitar still rocks, and Brian Johnson's bark continues to roar in all its shrill glory.  I'm not a metalhead by any means, but I know a good album when I hear one.  &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; is just that.
B00005JM1Y|3.0|First, let me say this is not a typical Hollywood comedy.  The origin of Johnny English, this spy spoof character, is a series of British TV commercials for credit card company televised in 1992.  The director is Peter Howitt (\\"Sliding Doors\\") and the star is Rowan \\"Mr. Bean/Blackadder\\" Atkinson.  And the film companies are Universal, Working Title, and Canal Studio, the trinity of hit film makers like \\"Bridget Jones.\\"  So, the basis of the film is for the audiences of UK, where \\"Jonny English became the No.1 hit three weeks in a row.<br />The story made by the writing team (Neil Purvis and Robert Wade) who wrote for the two real Bond films (\\"The Wolrd Is Not Enough\\" \\"Die Another Day\\") is just what you expect from this now overcrowded genre of spy parody films.  You got a comic hero who takes himslef very seriously; the \\"master mind\\" or \\"evil genius\\" played by John Malkovich with phoney French accent, and a hapless sidekick who unwisely (and unaccountably) follows the main character.  Oh, and a beautiful lady whose identity should be somewhere between undercover agent and enemy in disguise.<br />Frankly, I did not laugh as much as I expected, but the some people around me are enjoying the film so much (and I saw it in Japan), so it is purely a matter of taste whether or not you like the film.  As far as the gags and gadgets are concerned, there are nothing unique or original, but as this is Atkinson's film, if you find his mugging face funny, you will have a good time all through the film.   <br />As you expect from many British comedies, Rowan Atkinson's approach to his character is very low-key, and even serious.  Of course you are supposed to laugh when we see him confidently do stuffs like car chaces or gun-shooting, and as you always know, he blunders at the crutial moment.  Unlike Austin Powers, Atkinson plays Johnny English character quite straightforward even in incredibly stupid situations.  It sounds hilarious to some of us, to be sure, but as you know, the definition of comedy depends on your cultural background.  In that sense, this is very English.<br />Look for the cameo appearace of Greg Wise (\\"Sense and Sensibility\\") as the coolest agent in MI7.
B00008X5J1|4.0|I didn't want to see this movie at first. However, working in a movie theatre as a projectionist, I couldn't help but see a few clips of the movie, and came to realise that this was going to be a 'must see.' When first I saw the film of the three times I watched it in the theatres, I was stunned by the sheer brilliance of this great movie. History blended with a kind of reality that brought it all home in a way that I never could have imagined would happen. The portrayals of Bill the Butcher by Daniel Day-Lewis and of Amsterdam Vallon by Leonardo DiCaprio are outstanding. The thoughts and the feelings emenating from these characters really showed a lot about the history of the time, and brought the reality of the wars going on in New York at the time straight home. <br />Set at the beginning of the civil war during the first draft, this movie speaks a great deal of the trials of those who came off the boats from Europe and the way that they were treated. It speaks a lot of our own American History and the culture of the time, and should speak to the heart of anyone who has a close connection to the draft and to war in general. I found the thoughts presented by both Bill and Amsterdam to be phenomenal, the acting to be superb and the directing to be outstanding.<br />The one drawback in this film is Cameron Diaz. I feel that she was selected for the part based on her pretty face and not on her acting abilities (or lack thereof). The scenes in which she starred detracted from the overall feeling of the film and resulted in a removal of atmosphere from what could have been some of the best sections, especially in her relationships with the two leading men in the story. A better actress could have been chosen, although truly I have no recommendations which I ca make at this point in time.<br />Additionally, I feel that there were parts of this movie where the blood and the sex was somewhat distracting from the historical setting. On the other hand, these elements addedto an alternative view of the history we have come to know through our textbooks and in school, and perhaps, viewed objectively, these elements actually added quite a bit to the film itself, although I fear not to the plot.<br />My recommendation is to watch this movie yourself and see what you think; while I can't gauruntee that you will enjoy it, I must say that it is worth the viewing, if not once, then many times.
B000088E6D|3.0|&quot;They&quot; tell us that Buble is the next great pop interpreter. Maybe. But there is little evidence of it here. He is good, and has a good voice, but you've heard it all before. He sounds like a replay of Harry Connick, with a little Darin tossed in and echoes of Sinatra. Of course, Connick was himself accused of being too derivative of Sinatra. So the question here becomes--what's new? The answer--nothing. It's pleasant elevator music in the style of the aforementioned guys, well done for its type, but lacking anything distinctive or truly artistic. Sinatra, one might remember, was an innovator in many ways. Let's see Buble do something to make his mark, not just mimic others....
6301763041|5.0|The first movie in which I ever saw Johnny Depp, and I have watched it more than thirty times since then! This is a great movie, full of fun, laughs, and satire, plus the ever sexy Johnny Depp!
B000000OF6|5.0|This double-CD is by far the most complete of all the greatest hits and best of collections by this theatrical UK band. Although they weren't always highly regarded by rock critics, Queen's popularity is remarkably enduring.  That is perhaps explained by the fact that they didn't only offer over-the-top schlock-rock, but created remarkable versatile music, especially in the hit singles.<br />This is best demonstrated on Disc One, where the faux-classical Bohemian Rhapsody appears next to the funky dance classic Another One Bites The Dust. There's also the rockabilly flavoured Crazy Little Thing Called Love, power ballads like the impressive Somebody To Love and anthemic numbers like We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions.<br />On Disc Two my favorites include the catchy Under Pressure (with David Bowie) and the hypnotic, synth-driven Radio Ga Ga. Above all, Queen's strength lies in their gripping melodies, innovative arrangements and spectacular harmonies. Their best work dates from the seventies and eighties but even the later singles have lost none of their sing-along appeal.<br />This is a great compilation of ageless songs from one of the top UK bands of all time and it comes with a fact- and photo-filled booklet tracing their history and their achievements. An album set that definitely ought to be in every rock lover's collection.
B00009Y3SA|5.0|This movie was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I watched it at a pre-screening at the movie theatre for which I was working with two friends, and we were literally rolling in the isles. It didn't hurt that the three of us identify as 'queer' but this movie truly had us in stitches! Keep an eye on the girl's younger brother; that is where most of the laughs are! Great work, and so worth seeing!
B000008H4E|4.0|After a few occasional get-togethers, the on-again-off-again Yes singer and Greek instrumentalist finally release an entire LP of their own.  It would be a depature from the Yes mould for Anderson.  His lyrics are inspired by then-wife Jenny.  The album is a bit slow and is an acquired taste.  Originally released March 1980.  I have the LP.  I almost got the import, but I came up short!
B00008X5J3|5.0|Were there a way to give a movie a six, that would be this movie. It is truly the best film that I have seen in many, many years, and was a brilliant telling of a very classic story. The blend of musical numbers with acted scenes was pulled off remarkably in this movie, and the film version allowed for plays that would not have been accomplished on the stage. <br />The vocal talents of actor Richard Gere and those of Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are unbelievable. Who knew? But it is Queen Latifah who really took the stage away in her brilliant portrayal of Matron 'Mama' Morton. We knew she had a brilliant voice, and we knew that she could act. We knew that she was gorgeous, but how she pulled this movie off is truly, truly outstanding. She brings it all together and it is her talent that glues the entire film together and makes it what it is. She is stunning and unbelievable in this role, and is to be commended for the great work which she did. Her fans will be thrilled with this movie, as will fans of the musical genre as a whole.<br />This one is a 'must see!'
B00003CXWV|3.0|Chronicling the life and crimes of George Jung, Blow sizzles with style, but substance (not substances, theres plenty of those here) is another story.  Thanks to Johnny Depp's superb performance as Jung, we feel sorry for Jung who rose to power in the marijuana and cocaine trades through the years only to lose it all to one police bust after another and after another.  If it were any other actor in the role, I doubt any sympathy would have been felt at all for Jung.  The rest of the cast includes Penelope Cruz as Jung's wife, Paul &quot;Pee-Wee Herman&quot; Ruben, Ethan Suplee, Cliff Curtis, and Ray Liotta as Jung's sympathetic, loving father.  Cruz is just plain annoying most of the time, while Liotta is his usual great self in his role.  All in all, Blow is worth a look, but a film which displays the dangers and consequences of addictions has been done better in films like Requiem For a Dream and Traffic.
0780626966|5.0|sorry about the previous review if it went through - i was wrong i thought this box set didnt include the glasses but it does.- i dont know what makes the platinum edition of this box set better than this regular edition but anyway they are both great and worth the money - includes all nightmare films and a bonus disk and 2 pairs of 3d glasses. any horror fan should own this collection.
B00005JLTN|5.0|So a lot of people were very disappointed with this movie. First of all, those people expected way too much ... you cannot re-create the same aura that the funky moves had in the first movie, especially since every action movie since 1999 has copied those same slow-motion moves. Secondly, a lot of people didn't understand the plot of the movie. They didn't understand the significance of showing all the love scenes between Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss ... it is because of this love that Neo makes the decision he does towards the end of the movie, instead of following the path his predecessors choose. Also, the plot has several twists and turns, none more so profound than the one where the Matrix reveals that it created Zion on purpose to round up the rebels, and how the cycle of \\"The Ones\\" has occurred 5 times in the past. With such a plot, how can anyone be disappointed with this movie?<br />I would definitely recommend this movie. Don't expect to be awed by the action scenes as you were in the first movie, but enjoy it it it's own right. And if you don't understand what is going on, ask someone else to explain the story to you. I know I had to do it for a couple of my friends.
B00006LPER|1.0|This film is simply boring, as are perversions, fixations and all that stuff that in general interests solely psychoanalists,and that just because they get paid to listen to such idiotic craziness. Huppert is OK in this horrid movie, nevertheless I would not save her from the blast. All you will get is annoyed from watching this, it allows no day-after thoughts, it does not linger on within you, as nothing in the movie actually is transcending in any conceivable way.<BR>This film is about a pianist who happens to have hell for a home. Continuing the metaphor, the musician's mother is a she-devil kind of thing. To be fair to, well, the devil devil, who's most likely a guy, the pianist's mother is no more than a crippled old lady who has raised her child in an incestuous fashion, thus promoting the multiple sexual nightmarish deeds this woman, as an adult, would engage in. Along with that, the lack of love she &quot;suffers from&quot; proves to be the same rejection and hatred she actually demands in others and, accordingly, delivers to everyone surrounding her.<BR>This film is like a classical videoclip. While we enjoy some Schumann tunes we see the piano teacher wrapping herself in acts of extreme cruelty, sex that is far from enjoyable to any average individual, over the edge irrational unbuyable conversation with her mother, the pursual of something more love-like in a younger person (that is, mostly being despised and having a kick out of it). To decidedly ruin the movie is the ending, which stands as one of the worst I have ever undergone.<BR>This film has no story line, it does not reach out to the viewer, in it there is no landmark aesthetics of any sort, no revolt against anything, no adherence to anything. It is nonesense poured  into allegedly disturbing images, but why would any creator do that? Just for the sake of filming sickening stuff. That is easy to do. Tape a dog dying or a mother crying the loss of her child and you are there. But what for? And, is it cinema?   <BR>This film is garbage. The main character seeked hatred. Go a step further ahead and hate the whole thing altogether.
B00000K2UX|5.0|In 1986, &quot;Top Gun&quot; took the world by storm with its somewhat likeable cast, completely unrealistic but fun dogfight scenes, and its very-80s soundtrack.  Harold Faltermeyer composed the score for the film (which Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer previously worked with him on &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;) and a handful of artists performed the many songs that have become 80s staples.  Many have called this the best 80s soundtrack; that might be up for debate, BUT this soundtrack is still great!  A 5-star gem and an all-time classic.  Now, let's go &quot;through the fire&quot; and take a look at the tracklist:<br />Danger Zone, performed by Kenny Loggins<br />- Obviously, the most popular song on the album and one of the best.  Ironically, Kenny wasn't the original choice for this song and he was last minute.  Who would've thought that this would become his biggest staple?<br />Mighty Wings, performed by Cheap Trick<br />- GREAT SONG, and the only one Harold Faltermeyer wrote (he would use some of the instrumentation from this song and put it with his score).  This is by far my favorite track on this soundtrack, although it sounds quite different from Cheap Trick's other songs.<br />Playing with the Boys, performed by Kenny Loggins<br />- While far from bad, I never quite got into this song.  Still pleasurable to listen to, however.  Kenny also co-wrote this song.<br />Lead Me On, performed by Teena Marie<br />- Pretty good pop tune, Teena Marie has some top-notch vocals here.  This one took a while for me to enjoy, but let it grow on you and you can see why it's good.<br />Take My Breath Away, performed by Berlin<br />- Often titled the &quot;Love Theme&quot; from Top Gun, this quite good.  The mood of the song combined with great vocals brings us a great romantic ballad.  This, of course, is one of the huge hits from the soundtrack.  You can't go through life without hearing this.<br />Hot Summer Nights, performed by Miami Sound Machine<br />- I was never a huge fan of Miami Sound Machine, but this one of the few of theirs I personally enjoyed.<br />Heaven in your Eyes, performed by Loverboy<br />- Loverboy IS AWESOME, and this song is a GREAT ballad.  I really like this song, even above Berlin's famous love theme (and that's saying a lot because it's still a great song)!  It was often said that this song almost ruined their career; doesn't make sense, given its great quality.  Oh well.<br />Through the Fire, performed by Larry Greene<br />- A great track with some great guitarmanship!  Larry's career never really seemed to take flight, which is quite a shame.  If you've never heard of him, I can't blame you, since if it weren't for this soundtrack and &quot;Over the Top,&quot; I wouldn't have ever heard of this guy.<br />Destination Unknown, performed by Marietta<br />- A mellower track from another &quot;unknown&quot; artist (Ha, couldn't resist!).  This one goes by as rather underrated, which is rather a shame because this is a pretty good song.<br />Top Gun Anthem, performed by Harold Faltermeyer with Steve Stevens<br />- I didn't lie, this is SCORE from the film, as opposed to a song.  He wrote this with guitarist Steve Stevens, who if you can recall, he played with Billy Idol.  A VERY recognizable anthem and one of my favorite pieces of music that I can play on the guitar!<br />~BONUS TRACKS~<br />Dock of the Bay, performed by Otis Redding<br />- They included this because this was Maverick's mother's favorite song.  It's only mentioned in the film, so I somewhat find this questionable to be included.  Oh well, no complaints.<br />Memories, performed by Harold Faltermeyer<br />- A piece of score from the movie, this is played when Maverick is mourning the death of Goose.  This is a good piece of music, although I WISHED THAT THEY INCLUDED THE DOGFIGHT MUSIC AS WELL.  That's my only real complaint with this album, actually.<br />Great Balls of Fire, performed by Jerry Lee Lewis<br />- Technically, you hear thissong in the film when Maverick and Goose perform it!  Still, this track is a great piece of the past, so I have absolutely no complaints with it being a bonus track.<br />You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling, performed by The Righteous Brothers<br />- Again, you hear it in the movie when Maverick, Goose, and a whole plethora of people perform it.  But of course, this is CLASSIC.  I'm glad this was included.<br />Playing with the Boys (Dance Mix), performed by Kenny Loggins<br />- A dance remix of the song, but for some odd reason, I actually like this more than the original!  I usually don't like the remix as much as the original, but this is a huge exception.<br />This is one of the few commercially successful soundtracks that actually strengthens the film.  I love this album greatly, and it is a definite 80s rock CLASSIC.  If you're an 80s fan that hates this, I don't care what your reason is, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY AND UNDENIABLY WRONG.  This helped DEFINE the 80s, and created itself to be a pop culture icon.  This is a great soundtrack of a great film.  No rock collection is complete without this.ick and Goose perform it!  Still, this track is a great piece of the past, so I have absolutely no complaints with it being a bonus track.<br />You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling, performed by The Righteous Brothers<BR>- Again, you hear it in the movie when Maverick, Goose, and a whole plethora of people perform it.

B000092Q4U|2.0|Ok, I liked the band on the Freddy vs. Jason soundtrack which I recommend so heavily I'd pay like 32$ for it, it's really good BUT the band's CD is far to repetetive its hard to tell the diffrence between songs and I know that sounds like I'm slow but seriously every song sounds the same and I LOVE this kind of music (slipknot, Hatebreed, Etc) but there has to be something in a song that sets it apart from the rest and this album only 2 or 3 songs are noticably diffrent.

B00005JKG7|3.0|John Carpenter is one of those filmmakers whose work is always worth watching, even when it isn't at its peak (such as with &quot;Vampires&quot; and &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot;), because it's as fun to figure out why the movies don't work as it is to figure why they do when they do (for examples of John Carpenter that really works, see &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot;).  &quot;The Fog&quot; is like most of Carpenter's work; it's somewhere in the middle of great and mediocre, with great individual scenes but a lack of overall cohesion.<br />The first encounter with the ghost ship and the fog is one of the scarier scenes I can think of in all of cinema.  Sadly, there is nothing else anywhere in the movie that gets even close to that scene.  What's left is merely competent fright-flick stuff, with generally good performances and a creepy score (by Carpenter himself).<br />The DVD is a pretty good one.  The video transfer is probably as good as it could be, and makes a good showcase for the fabulous fog effects devised by the crew, and for the excellent cinematography by Dean Cundey.  The half-hour documentary on the making of the film is admirable for its honesty (Carpenter speaks refreshingly about how he felt the first cut of the film sucked, necessitating extensive reshoots).<br />This is defintely worth watching if you are into horror movies; less serious fans of the genre should probably rent before buying.
6300216039|5.0|I have watch a lot of Romeo and Juliet movies and this one is the best and even my English teacher said that.  I though that it was going to be boring, but it wasn't it was great.  At my school, we watch this movie and we always get the same movie when it gets worn out.  It is that good.  Everyone sould get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie is amazing to watch.  It's a little confusing with three storylines, and lots of changes from the book, but I can live with that.  Great stunts by Legolas -- as when he mounts a horse and shoots arrows while sliding down the stairs -- it's almost worth buying the DVD just to see those.  Like the Fellowship of the Rings, it is an excellent production, flawless except for one thing: when Pippin was about to be trampled by a horse, his hands were already free, yet a few moments later, he was shown crawling, his hands still bound, toward an orc ax to cut his bond?  This movie is worth seeing at least once, and the DVD is worth buying.  The extended version is coming soon with more good stuff, and you can wait for that, or get both versions.  A lot of people complain about the departures from the book, but no one, I think, is disappointed having seen this movie.

6305291446|5.0|H20 is the best of the halloween sequels to date. it has chills, thrills &amp; laughs without losing the spirit of the Halloween films. I recomend this movie to fans not only of the &quot;halloween&quot; films but of horror in general.
B00006F83Y|5.0|this album is great, a beautiful melodic speed driven rock. it's very fun to listen to. quotsa is only getting better with each album. somewhat frequent mock radio broadcasts interrrupt however; but not unbearable. buy this album while you can, its a great addition to your collection. at any rate, its a beautiful album for any time of day or mood, well worth the money.
0060254920|5.0|This is a great book for story time - it is a \\"big\\" story. A little bit scary, but very, very imaginative. Beautifully illustrated.<br />The hero of the tale is having a bit of a bad day, and has landed himself into a heap of trouble with his mother. It's all about the desire to run away and join the \\"wild things\\", and then the really strong need to stay where one is loved and safe.<br />I loved this book as a child, and I loved giving a copy to my own son for his birthday. We love reading this together. <br />Definitely one of those \\"keep it forever\\" books!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I totally AGREE with Elyse! i ALSO am 16 (but live in Australia) and Judy is one of my favourite actors!! (probably my 2nd favourite after Barbra Streisand!) <BR>Judy does a SPECTACULAR performance (as she always does) and I too would LOVE to have this title on DVD!! I would LOVE to see some special fetures dug up from the MGM volts!<BR>Margret O'Brian's emmy-winning performance is also SPECTACULAR! I especially like her \\"Mr Neely\\" scene (HER opening scene) she is just adorable! (p.s. to Judy fans who have seen \\"Babes On Broadway\\" with Mickey Rooney, Margret O'Brien has a cameo in it! She stands on a table and says something along the lines of \\"Please don't send my brother to the chair, please please!\\" - as an audition in the movie.. very cute!)<BR>Anyway, i was very glad to read her review (Alyse?!) because i thought i was the ONLY \\"NORMAL\\" teenager in the world who can appreciate trrue talent! Rock on, if you're ever down under, id love to meet you.<BR>Jessica<BR>Syd, NSW Australia
0783225970|5.0|Finally scarface is on DVD! Al Pacino delivers one of his greatest performances ever!! The ending to this movie make it a classic! An absolute must have for action movie fans!!
B000089RVX|1.0|If you like MTV to spoon-feed you what they consider to be good music then by all means waste your money/download time on this album. If however you actually like to think for yourself and want to hear a great female fronted goth/rock/metal band (without the lame rapping). Then check out The Gathering!! Recommeded albums to start with &quot;Nighttime Birds&quot;, and &quot;If_Then_Else&quot;.
B0000C8AQM|4.0|This collection really embodies everything the movie is about:  Rockin, rockin, and more rockin.  There are some great classic rock tracks and the two selections by the School of Rock band are fantastic.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because I would have liked some of the songs Jack Black sang throughout the movie to be on the CD (for example, the Math Song).  Otherwise, any fan of good, solid rock and roll or anyone who just dug the movie should definitely pick this up.
B000089RVR|3.0|I think my expectations for Dido's second album may have been too high, because I was so looking forward to hearing a brand new compilation of ethereal sultry sounds that I feel defined her sound on the No Angel album.  I purchased the import version of the No Angel album which has additional tracks, &quot;Worthless&quot; being my favorite song by Dido.  <BR>The Life for Rent album has great music, and many of the songs are growing on me, but initially I was disappointed that each song didn't blow me away on the first listen.
B00006F83Y|5.0|There's not alot to say to describe this album, it's just that unbelievably good. When i put in the cd and listened to Millionaire, I knew this was a good album. Then throw in songs like No One Knows, First it giveth, and my personal favorite go with the flow, the exploding guitar, pounding drums by dave grohl, and amazing vocals make this album one of the greatest albums since nirvana's nevermind. A true triumph for rock music, 5 stars. Go out and buy it.
B00008EY9G|5.0|As far as I could tell, twist endings are very hard to pull off. They require very careful precise for every single detail. The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and obviously Sixth Sense told you the ending, then re-explained it. Without it you'd go &quot;what the hell? why is he all of a sudden....?&quot;. Well this movie does a good job of explaining, and brings in some fine acting. <br />The movie starts with a hearing of Malcolm Rivers, a convicted killer one day away from execution where the defense has new evidence which could possibly save him. On the other side, 11 people are stranded in a motel during a huge storm. One by one, they start dying and it's up to survivors to figure out who done it, especially when strange occurences start to happen. <br />John Cusack gives a great performance, I don't really care for Amanda Peet as a whole so I'm biased, Ray Liotta as usual plays a big hothead and Rebecca de Mornay plays the classic stuck up actress. Also credit goes to Pruitt Taylor Vince playing Rivers. When the big revelation is revealed near the end, watch Pruitt's facial expression; it's as if he's doubling Ed's reaction to the revelation.<br />Classic whodunnit with great performances and intelligent twist where I'd ask the question: do we convict the body or the mind?
B0000C7PSW|5.0|This album is such a classic example of the 'slow burner'. On first listen 'i don't know what it is' & 'movies of myself' really stood out but slowly over repeated listens all the songs began to touch and thrill. Unlike other albums - where the tunes that grabbed you at first seem boring after a while - 'want one' slowly takes shape like a rich patchwork quilt moving the listener as a continuous cycle of songs. <BR>Whilst there are a rare couple of cringe-worthy Andrew Lloyd Webberesque moments (notably 'Natasha')- 'Want One' at its best sounds like Jeff Buckley getting his hands on some lost outtakes from Pet Sounds. Best tunes.. 'I dont know/ Beautiful Child/ 14th. Street'<BR>My general view on pop music over the last decade is generally one of bewilderment at why someone like Rufus hasn't come along before- but hes here now and long may he make music that reminds you of falling in love whilst taking your breath away. <BR>So in other words, you should really check this album out- 'Grace' for a new generation but with better songs.....
0783114893|3.0|man, what a dissapointment! I thought the idea behind this movie was great so I cheacked it out(its good Amazon rating also influenced me to see it).<br />Maybe I went into the movie expecting something else, because I didn't get the intelligent fun thriller I was expecting. This movie is more like a B horror film, rather then a realistic thrill ride. Rutger Haurer did a wonderful acting job, but the guy is more like Micheal Myers then a real pyschotic hitcher. Rutger shows up like a genie at every turn and he is almost invincible.<br />acting=4 stars<br />FX=NA<br />ending=3.5 stars<br />atmosphere=3 stars<br />Editing&Directing=2 star<br />storyline=2 stars<br />meaningfullness=NA<br />OVERALL-2.9 stars<br />A really weak unrealistic movie that must have been a favorite on USA up all night. I think people who praise this movie, like it more for nostolgic reasons, then if its good or bad...
1881273156|5.0|After I read this book and confirmed my own love language I said to myself, &quot;I wish I'd had known this twenty years ago when I was first married&quot;. I would recommend this book to all couples and singles who are contemplating marriage. Understanding the person you love is the first step in improving your relationship. I believe couples considering divorce would be wise to try the suggestions in this book before calling it quits. I plan on giving this book as a gift to those who could use the help. My wife and I will also teach these concepts to our three boys.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Greendale is much more then new songs from Neil Young. The songs take you on an adventure into the lives of one family the Greens. From Grandpa to Sun Green you can feel their loves, hurts and passions. Neil Young has created something special with Greendale and I'm glad I had the opportunity to see the show performed live. When the movie is released it will all fall together. I've seen all of the videos of the songs that have been shown to date. The only ones that are left to see our Sun Green and Carmichael. Neil Young's web site helps you understand all you need to know about Greendale. Thanks, Neil! If this would be the last work he ever did it would be a wonderful way to end a remarkable career. I hope that he has many more years to be as creative as he has been over all these years.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is Slayer's best. They've always been known for razor-sharp guitar work and some of the nastiest speed-riffs ever made, but this is it. If you haven't heard this yet then you're in for a treat. It's incredible to realize that the entire CD is only about a half hour long, and yet it captures the full horrific vision - the full power and awe of probably the last band in the world to play with full on-stage walls of Marshall amplifiers. If you like this kind of music then do yourself a favor and listen to one of the best speed metal bands ever at their peak. Enjoy.
B00004RHZU|2.0|Pink's debut album should be consider a missed step in her music career, &quot;Missundeztood&quot; is way superior to this!. Not that this recopilation of wannabe R&amp;B songs have no good high points, to be more specific, this is the track rewiews, &quot;Split Personality&quot; the open track, features a story telling of somebody with TWO FACES, this is one of the few songs, that are safe, and nice too listen to it, good post britney beats, &quot;Hell Wit Ya&quot; I don't know if they intended to put the nice songs, first, but it seems like they did, Hell.... is a fast track sending somebody you know where..., &quot;Most Girls&quot; I guess this is the best track, but tooo looong, radiot edit , please, great background, great lyrics, &quot;There You Go&quot; this debut single sounded like many songs produced by Kandi and Shekespere by that time, it's just another track, that does not harm, is not one of my favorite I must say, well there you go looking pitiful, &quot;You Make Me Sick&quot; third single, wasn't a hit, but best video of the three, ok song, &quot;Let Me Let You KNow&quot; the parade of filler tracks began here, anoying ballad song, &quot;Love Is Such a Crazy Thing&quot;, anoying piano, pop and r&amp;b, and robotic beats, &quot;Private Show&quot; at the beginnig sounds like is gonna be great but ends up been another drawning track, &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot; sounds like all those not apporting nothin' new tracks, anoying, no worth it, can't take me to mama, can't take me to papa, whassup with that?, &quot;Stop Falling&quot; great vocals, this song is should have been more exploded with her vocal range, but serves well, &quot;Do What U Do&quot;  oh oh oh oh oh!, hate that part, no good!, &quot;Hiccup&quot; this track even do has a funny title is one of the best tracks in the whole cd, I love it, when she does like that desperate singing!, it's great tune, &quot;Is It Love&quot; filler period.  This album is really full with filler tracks, drop outsof other artist, is better to not see this part of Pink!, If you can get the singles, all three are available.  No wonder she put out her second album so fast and change her musical style that made her a international star rock-pop way to go Pink.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Each piece of art is an original work of art.  Comparing one work of art to another doesn't make sense.  Ray of Light, Music, American Life.  They're all such amazing works of art in their own way.  That's what makes Madonna such of an amazing artist.  Why would she want to make a 'Ray of Light-part2' or a 'Music-part2'?   American Life is original, folksy, and futuristic.  It's definitely my favorite Madonna album to date.  Essential tracks include:  'I'm so Stupid', 'Love Profusion', 'X-Static Process', 'Intervention', 'Nobody Knows Me', 'Easy Ride', 'Nothing Fails', and 'Hollywood'.  <br />So, what is art?  <br />Madonna's 'American Life' CD is an amazingly original piece of art.  Surely not like the boring top-40 stuff contaminating the airwaves everyday.  <br />'American Life' = five stars
0440180295|5.0|Wonderful book. In a nutshell, this books is a novel in a novel. The book starts following the \\"author\\" who is wrote a story about Dredsen -- a famous bombing during WWII. The main character in his book is man who is able to move about in time as he will. That probably sounds a little confusing, but that's the best way I can describe it.<br />This book doesn't glamorize war. In fact, it's a very anti-war book. It doesn't make the people in the war look like heroes with an unhealthy lust for defending their countries. Most of the characters were just human. Some were too old, too young, too cowardly for war. They questioned the need for war, but still they had no way to stop it. Many were too young for the war hence the sub-title \\"The Children's Crusade\\".<br />But the book isn't just about war. Some might see it as a SciFi book (the time traveling). We see the character, Billy Pilgrim, in various stages of his life, his birth, his marriage, his wife's death, etc. This book is also slightly cheeky in nature. Some might see it as a satire. There are many things going on in this book making it one of those book that you have to read more than once to catch different subplots.<br />Vonnegut has a style that tends to ramble, and I can see why that would annoy some people. The story also could be a little confusing, and one might question the point, but it made perfect sense to me. I enjoy this book muchly.
0446677450|1.0|There is no secret formula to wealth, but that's what the author implies.  I have a JD/MBA and I am an entrepreneur owning several businesses. Obviously, i have learned a great deal from books, but this book is an outrage.  From its offensive title to the insipid dribble he feeds us for 200 pgs, Kiyosaki fails to say anything.  He has become fabulously wealthy by duping us into spending $12 of our hard-earned cash to tell us things that are trite (most of the book), misleading (our house is not an asset), or wrong (taxes punishes the wealthy).  Howard Schulz, Jack Welsh, and Sam Walton all had poor dads who taught them one thing-- hard work, dedication, and passion are the keys to success.  Please, if you want to read this book, CHECK IT OUT FROM THE LIBRARY!!!! and read it critically.  Don't let him fool you too.

B000063DS1|5.0|I'm only in my twenties right now, and most people I know have barely even heard of the Band, if they've heard of them at all. Sets like this are of the reason that I feel like I was born too late. The sixties and seventies were an amazing era musically, and I don't see how something like The Last Waltz could ever happen today.  All the more reason to treasure an amazing thing that happened here: A bunch of people just got together and made some great music.  Broken down to that, The Last Waltz sounds like Woodstock or Monterey Pop, and in some ways it is.  But The Last Waltz carries more weight then either of those concerts, as this would be the last time that The Band would play together.  At least, that was the plan...<br />The Band played for five hours and people still wanted more.  The hits are all here -- &quot;Up On Cripple Creek&quot;, &quot;The Weight&quot;, &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, etc. -- and each one of them is played with passion by a band that is just making great music, but knows that it is coming to an end.<br />The guest cast is amazing.  Bob Dylan and Ronnie Hawkins are great musicians, and they had to appear for the night to be complete -- if you know The Band's history, you'll understand why.  Friends and heroes like Dr. John, Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Neil Diamond, Van Morrison, The Staples, and more rounded out a set of music with a combination of variety and quality that you'll be hard-pressed to find elsewhere.  Even Ringo Starr makes an appearance on drums at the end of the third disk.  Where else will you find a combination of songs like &quot;Caravan&quot;, &quot;Such a Night&quot;, &quot;Mannish Boy&quot;, &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Helpless&quot;?  The Band was more than willing to relegate themselves to backing band status once again, and it pays off big time.  Perhaps the most amazing part of the whole event is how seamlessly they played with any other artist they shared the stage with.  You would have thought that they had all played together for years.  (Of course, a few of them had actually done so...)<br />This is all it is, whether you listen to the discs or view the concert DVD.  No gimmicks.  No dance routines.  No women kissing each other for publicity's sake.  Just great musicians and great songs.  Incidentally, the liner notes are great too.  They really put the whole event in a wider context that I might have missed out on otherwise.<br />If you are a fan of classic rock, your collection is not complete until you have this box set and the concert DVD.  And if you are not a fan of classic rock, why did you read down this far?  All the same, even non-rockers will probably appreciate the variety of soul, country, blues, and classical influences found throughout this album.  Fork over the cash and get yourself of a copy of The Band's last stand.  You won't regret it.
B0000399WI|5.0|&quot;You can't imprison what's inside&quot; says educated innocent white Andy to uneducated black guilty Red (he's called Red as it must be the Irish in him, he reckons).  This is a great movie.  Partly the voiceover by Morgan Freeman, partly the underplaying by Tim Robbins, partly the brilliant setting of mood by Director Frank Darabont, partly the importance given to making all the speaking parts interesting characters, all together it stands as a great movie. A feel good film that's for sure.  Good does triumph, Yep. The baddies get their comeuppance, Yep.  More please.  One to own.  The victim of one of the silliest reviews by Leonard Maltin who claims it is too long.  PLEEAASE!!!
0897500482|5.0|This book is the bomb. It teaches you great moves that are realy HELPFUL. A great book if you want to learn some basic or advance moves and skills. I HIGHLY recomend this FANTASTIC book.
B00005Y7NK|2.0|-and those keyboards? No thanks. I would recommend this more to a Dokken or Whitesnake fan, than a fan of vintage Black Sabbath.
B00008OWZC|4.0|Jimmy Page tries to make a perfect product when he should leave well enough alone.  Anyone who owns the bootlegs of the two shows which make up HTWWW knows that we're missing some tasty treats from both nights. (Louie Louie from the 25th and Blueberry Hill from the 27th, for example.)  Find the bootlegs and give 'em a listen; you'll thank me later.<br />When Page finally gets around to releasing what's in his vault like Pearl Jam, The Dead, and Phish are doing, I'll start buying the live shows, but for now I'll stick with the unofficial live recordings.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok, so there are two groups of reviews for this album - those who &quot;rave&quot; about it and those who say it's crap, dull, nonsence, and way too overrated. The second group of reviews state that noone really likes this album and all the positive reviews are written by people who want to look smarter than they really are. The truth is that people have different tastes in music, and not everyone can appreciate the genius of OK COMPUTER. This doesn't make it stupid, crap, dull, overrated, etc. I listen to this album very often - along with all of Radiohead's albums - and I am pretty sure that this is some of the best music ever made. One review had 1 star and the author wrote below that the actual rating was 5 stars, but he wanted to get noticed. Writing a 1 star review for a 5 star album is a good way to get noticed, isn't it?
B00008AWOD|5.0|I'm a pretty new fan of Placebo. I got into them with &quot;Every Me, Every You&quot;. I bought this cd expecting to find, maybe, a handful of songs that I liked. I was absolutely amazed when I first heard the cd. It's an all around fantastic cd. A couple songs I'm not so big on, like &quot;Plastecine&quot;, but songs like &quot;The Bitter End&quot; and &quot;Protect Me From What I Want&quot; by far make up for it. I also really love &quot;I'll Be Yours&quot; although it is, admitedly, a bit unusual. Love &quot;Special Needs&quot; (btw, the video is beautiful). I highly recommend this cd. (and it works in every cd player I've tried...)
B00008S2VG|4.0|I don't know why so many people dislike this album so much when it has beautiful songs; I know that some of them are kind of boring, such as &quot;X-STATIC PROCESS&quot; or &quot;EASY RIDE&quot; (I'm sorry Madonna, I love your music but these songs make me feel sleepy, no matter how beautiful the lyrics are, the music here sounds like: &quot;ok kids, it's time to go to bed!&quot; ); however, &quot;HOLLYWOOD&quot; , &quot;LOVE PROFUSION&quot;, &quot;NOTHING FAILS&quot;; &quot;I'M SO STUPID&quot;,and, two steps below, &quot;MOTHER AND FATHER&quot; and &quot;INTERVENTION&quot;; make this album worth it!!! I know it's not her best work, but you can easily enjoy it! Another thing: Why didn't they include a remix of &quot;DIE ANOTHER DAY&quot;? The album version is longer and, consequently, more boring! A new remix would've worked pretty well. My opinion about &quot;AMERICAN LIFE&quot;? Well, this song is not that bad, it has interesting things and maybe it could be improved remixing it. There's a song I haven't written about, it's called &quot;NOBODY KNOWS ME&quot;, I don't know what to write about it, it's not a great song, not my favourite, but still, not that bad! <br />My advice: BUY THIS ALBUM! When I listen to NOTHING FAILS and I see my mother trying to sing along even though she doesn't speak English, or when I see my elder brother-who doesn't like Madonna-enjoying HOLLYWOOD, I understand that Madonna still has that thing that makes her THE REAL,UNIQUE AND ETERNAL QUEEN OF POP; I'm sure that the failures of this album are not her fault, maybe we should blame someone else (Warner, maybe?).
B00006AUIG|5.0|I read the amazon.com review and realized that it wasn't accurate.  The tapes that &quot;Mike&quot; finds have nothing to do with a sexual abuse case, but rather a woman who was institutionalized as a young girl for killing her family.  She has three alter's (personalities).  <BR>The movie is very well acted, scripted and directed.  Everything that the director shows is for a reason and that also goes for everything said.  There are no coincidences.  I had to watch this movie about three times to really go back and see all the subtle connections, but it was worth it.  The guy who plays Mike also helped to write the script.  This movie is very believable which makes it even more scary.  There are no monsters or aliens, just the monsters inside each and every one of us who are just waiting for the right time to be set free.  <BR>This movie is also very good because it doesn't have to rely on blockbuster actors (actually, David Caruso is the only actor that I knew, but all of the actors did a fine job) and million dollar special effects.  This movie is too smart for that. <BR>Sit back and enjoy- you are in for a real treat!
6305882592|2.0|This is a movie that is way out of the scope for my age group but one viewing later I feel this movie has an overall feel for any generation. The sublties that this movie has is very introspective. I especially found the concentration camp tatoo on Maud's arm to be a very meaningful touch, almost like a motivation. This movie in my opinion is the greatest love story since Romeo and Juliet.
B000069CWE|5.0|At first, I was skeptikal about buying this CD - i absolutley love Linkin Park, but I thought that this would be another corny remix CD - the songs sounding pretty much like the originals but just made longer and maybe a few added choruses. Linkin Park (yet again) broke the mold and created an amazing compilation of songs that are not only creative, but innovative and unforgettable. LP was able to compilate some of the best mixers, rappers, and other popular rock artists to make this another excellent musical creation. \\"Reanimation\\" is indescribable - an amazing CD that deserves much more credit and recognition than it has been given. The songs still retain the backdrop so you know which song is which, but they are completley reconstructed into stunning mixes which make it worth the purchase. My favorite songs on this album include ....<BR>1. By_Myslf (10/10) - this is one of my top favorite songs of this album. Every aspect about this song has been altered, but it still holds its emotional impact as it did in \\"Hybrid Theory\\".<BR>2. Enth E ND (8/10)<BR>3. Rnw@y (9/10) - the lyrics have been slightly altered, but i actually prefer the way that this remix sounds to the original -it has a certain indescribable catch to it that makes it great <BR>4. Pts.of.Athrty (10/10) - this song was remixed by Orgy and sounds absolutley terrific, with an added deeper tone to it (my favorite part of this song are the last 45 seconds of instruments and mixes)<BR>5. Cure for the Itch (8/10)- i loved this lyric free instrumental session from \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and was not let down when i heard it remixed here in \\"Reanimation\\". Added to this was sections from a song on the soundtrack to the movie \\"The Beach\\", which definatley complement the sound styles created by Linkin Park<BR>6. MY-Dsmbr (20/10) - ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING! i am a huge fan of LP and this is one of their best songs that i have ever heard - Chester Bennington sings at his best in this song and sounds beautiful with the accompaning tune - while this song was not released in the US, i would recommend this to anyone!<BR>7. A Place For My Head (7/10)- this was remixed with the help of Limp Biskit and Taproot - it has an incredible sound to it - again, its lyrics have been slightly altered, but it still sounds great<BR>8. Pushing Me Away (7/10)- while i prefer the original to this remix, i still think that LP did a great job on this<BR>9. FRGT/10 (9/10)- this has a great rap sound to this song, which was co-preformed with one of the members of Jurassic 5 (another great group - definatley check out some of their music)the beat, bass, and vocals are really different in this and bring this song onto a deeper, darker level<BR>10. With You (10/10)- Linkin Park did a great job on this remix - while it still holds the impact that the original \\"With You\\" has, there is an indescribable element in this song which makes it unforgettable. It is great how they mixed together piano, bass, and other mixes to make this on a whole new level<br />These songs will definaltley engross the listener and make this an amazing listening experience. Linkin Park and the other creative artists did an amazing preformance that is sure to send chills down your spine, enhance your senses and completley overtake you with extreme vocals and sound which make this another unforgettable Linkin Park experience.
B0000584V3|2.0|I bought this album because I really enjoyed &quot;Funeral Portrait&quot; a song on the album. It turned out to be the only song on the album that sounded like metal. Most of everything else on the album is acoustic. Which is fine if you like that sort of thing.
B0000AR8NK|3.0|&quot;New Killer Star&quot; is a clever play on the way Americans mispronounce the word &quot;nuclear&quot; The Vapors did the same thing back in 1977 with their album &quot;New Clear Days&quot;. The song itself starts out as an acknowledgement of 9/11/01 and the now missing World Trade Center, &quot;scar over Battery Park&quot; but then proceeds to ramble on with non-sequiters about new girlfriends or something, &quot;I've found a better way&quot;. The tune is catchy but don't expect it to shed any light on anything, it reminds me of a line from David Byrne's &quot;Psycho Killer&quot;, &quot;You're talking a lot, but you're not saying anything.&quot; or perhaps from &quot;Girlfriend&quot; which states, &quot;as we get older and stop making sense&quot;<BR>Bowie also covers &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; and &quot;Try Some Buy Some&quot; for no apparent reason, album filler I suppose, they don't move me.<BR>As a long time listener to Bowie, I've grown to expect so much more, i.e. Aladdin Sane, Young Americans, and was extremely disappointed to be served up with empty pop<BR>There is not one song on the album that can make me break down and cry
B00005J9U1|3.0|Bob Marley is one of my favorite artists, but I was disapointed with this CD.  Buffalo Soldier and Stir it Up were edit versions.  A lot of songs, especially I Shot the Sheriff, faded out too early compared to other recordings I've heard.  This complimation may include more songs than others, but I think it's at a comprimise of the way they're presented.
B000002HRE|3.0|Not a buy, but the four songs that I heard, &quot;Fuel&quot;, &quot;The Memory Remains&quot;, &quot;Prince Charming&quot;, and &quot;Better Than You&quot;, certainly showed vast improvements over the disposable Load from the previous year.
B000002AVF|5.0|Daydream come true.  I used to think Music Box was the best Mariah Carey album.  However, I've been listening to this one more than ever, and realized that it's full of the songs I associate Mariah with, those sweet, caressing ballads that cover me like a warm blanket.<br />&quot;Fantasy&quot; after beginning with ethereal sounds, Mariah's haunting voice, and then that sweet piercing high note, then goes into a skippy thumping dance number overlaid with a sample of the Tom Tom Club's &quot;Genius Of Love&quot;.  It's an evolution from &quot;Dreamlover&quot;, more upbeat, with better lyrics.  This song is real, not just a sweet sweet fantasy.  Interesting to see Mariah's co-musical collaborators--Tina Weymouth and Chris Franz of Talking Heads, and Adrian Belew.<br />&quot;Underneath The Stars&quot; is a slow R&amp;B dance number with strong bass defining the tempo of the rhythm and its sweet and languid qualities.<br />OK, hands down, this is Mariah's best song ever, and I'm not saying this because it monopolized the Billboard charts for weeks.  &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; is the zenith of the gospel-tinged Mariah ballad that set people tingling since &quot;Vision Of Love&quot; stormed on radio.  This song makes &quot;Vision&quot; sound a raindrop, and like &quot;Vision&quot;, is another religious song masquerading as a pop song, but the bittersweet thoughts of the chorus<br />Then comes a familiar opening lyric, &quot;Lying beside you, here in the dark...&quot; with that piano.  Yes, it's written by Steve Pery and Jonathan Cain.  But when Mariah sings those opening words to &quot;Open Arms&quot;, it's got that silky, sultry touch, as if she's brushing my ear with her lips.  Her voice rises to its smooth soulfulness when she sings the chorus.  I could listen to this over and over, and it'd be something I'd want a prospective missus to give me in a mix tape.  What a daydream, eh?<br />The swaying mid-tempo &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot; is another #1 song and another candidate for a possible love tape for me.  It was produced by Jermaine Dupri, for which I give him credit.  He also does &quot;Long Ago&quot;.<br />&quot;I Am Free&quot; is another gospelish ballad, and after wandering through misery, she is free...to do what?  &quot;Free to live/free to laugh/free to soar/free to shine/free to give/free to love/free enough to fly.&quot;  I need to paste that on my binder.<br />&quot;When I Saw You&quot; is another favourite here.  rhythmically paced in 1,2,3,4 beat per syllable:  &quot;When I saw you (1234), When I Saw You (1234)/ I could not breathe (1234), I fell so deep (1234)&quot; and Mariah's voice sounds so rich and potent here I find it irresisible<br />&quot;Melt Away&quot; sizzles with another low sultry opening vocal.  Given that it is co-written by Babyface, its smooth R&amp;B overtones is not surprising.  The next one is another stunning ballad.  The piano, strings lullaby &quot;Forever&quot; has Mariah loving someone despite their parting and vowing to return should he need her.<br />The R&amp;B-techno of &quot;Daydream Interlude&quot; leads into the final ballad, which is more melancholy and might be a reflection of Mariah.  &quot;Looking In&quot; basically says despite the world of fame and fantasy, &quot;she smiles through a thousand tears&quot; and &quot;wades in insecurity.&quot;<br />So, many wonderful ballads, three of which I cherish so much, three other songs I'd want some girl to tape for me, that my heart nearly melted to tears.  That may also be the reason why she made a drastic shift to guest rappers in Glitter three albums later.  Still, this album is Mariah's masterpiece, songs that are kisses, tears, and hugs all at once.andidate for a possible love tape for me.

B00008H2LB|5.0|This cd is AMAZING! Here, the rates to its tracks:<br />01.Foreword: A start where the members of the band express themselves and describes this perfect cd. (NO RATE)<BR>02.Don't stay: A song which gives you a model of this cd in which Linkin Park features Rap, Heavy Metal &amp; Rock. Very Good Song! 8/10<BR>03.Somewhere I belong: This is their first single and once I heard to it I became a SUPERFAN of Linkin Park. Amazing song but not the best one. 9.5/10<BR>04.Lying from you: Chirriuping screams! The sounds in this songs are fantastic! I like this song more than &quot;Don't stay&quot;. 8.5/10<BR>05.Hit the floor: Not so good as the rest of the songs in this album. I believe this is the least well-done song. 7/10<BR>06.Easier to run: EXCELLENT song! It's similar to &quot;Crawling&quot; in Hybrid Theory, but with less screams. Well-done indeed! 10/10<BR>07.Faint: Second single and OUTSTANDING! The bridge is something incredible! The chorus is amazing and the music, too! EXCELLENT SONG! THE BEST IN THIS ALBUM! 10+++/10<BR>08.Figure.09: An excellent song, too. The intro is similar to &quot;Don't stay&quot;, however this song is the second best one in this album. I adore it! 10/10<BR>09.Breaking the habit: Rapid song, i particularly love the verse 3 where Chester sings with a variety of background sounds that give a mysterious climate to the song. Fantastic song! Very Good! 9.5/10<BR>10.From the inside: Very Good song with a lot of screams in the bridge. Very well-done indeed! 9/10<BR>11.Nobody's listening: This song is very different from the others 'cos it has a Rap style which in other songs it isn't very remarked as in this one. The tubes sounds give a tropical climate to the song. Excellent song!!! 10/10<BR>12.Session: It's like a moment to relax. No vocals.... only music. 8/10<BR>13.Numb: The third best song in this CD! EXCELLENT AS OUTSTANDING!!! It's the third single in this CD; the first is &quot;Somewhere I belong&quot;, and the second one is &quot;Faint&quot;. &quot;Numb&quot; is the third one. 10/10<br />Excellent work for Linkin Park. Congrats to all of U 'cause U surprised us once more with an outstanding album which is &quot;METEORA&quot;.
B0000BWVCJ|5.0|X2 was exciting and thrilling, intelligent and a little dark --just like the comic.  Although many folks might deride the paper and ink monthly series, the comic book is really an American art form, and one that's difficult to turn into a film.  X2 did well, picking up nicely on the heels of X-Men -- more mutant hatred and fear and welcome Nightcrawler.  He is my favorite!  The scene where Nightcrawler busts into the White House is superb -- honestly, the best bit of action you'll see in all the Marvel movies thus far!!!  But be warned -- although X2 is not as dark as Daredevil or sullen and sci fi as the Hulk, it has moments which may frighten the kids.  The scene where those paramilitary dudes are breaking into the school for gifted children is all too realistic a threat today.  But its just a movie. . . or a comic, or both.<br />X2 is a little more grown up than Spiderman.  There is less romance than that movie too.  You will love this movie if you love the X-men.  And if you don't know them, it will help you get to know them.  You'll learn more about Wolverine and his past, and see more of Magneto and his henchwoman.  The interaction between the whole group is outstanding.  And if you don't like mutants, you will still enjoy the action and story of X2.<br />Two questions you might ask yourself -- will there be an X2.5 release with the bigger bonus features as they did with the first movie?  And who can tell me what's up with Jean Grey -- she is pivotal to the whole X-men saga . . .
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is by far the best album by the Clash, and often called one of the best rock albums, period. Their first album, The Clash, had a raw sound resembling that of the Sex Pistols, and their later albums, Sandinista and Combat Rock, had more commercialzed pop, but this album mixes meaniful lyrics with easy listening ability. With everything rockabilly to ska, this album changed the way punk was veiwed. No longer was it just rebellious young people screaming about how they hated life and were going to overthrow modern society, but music that had politcal meaning, good vocals, etc etc... It really has something for everyone, even a friend of mine who cannot stand any rock admitted that she liked Train In Vain. A must buy.
B00005JKC3|1.0|OBJECTIONABLE:  I took my son to see this, and we ended up leaving the theater.  This movie was too moody, crowded with scientific goobledygook, and in some parts really scary.  When Bruce Banner flash-backed to his childhood and recalled the death of his mother, it was a big downer -- and not received well by my kid.  Don't bring the young un's to this poor effort. . . and don't buy this either.  Look for Spidey, X Men or even Daredevil.<br />UNFAITHFUL:  Not a good take on the comic.  I do not like the way they have changed the storyline.  The real origin of the hulk was not some horrific genetic infliction by a mad scientist, but really in various facets -- an accident.  Hulking is an accident, by all other accounts.  The movie poorly portays and confuses the various Hulk characters, making them what they never were in the comic, adds all new elements for it's own sake. It drags the story so long. . .<br />SLOW:  The special effects were good, but it took a long time to get the movie going, and there was too little action I think.  The movie goes on and on trying to justify it's own take on the hulk myth, twisting it badly, and it does a poor job of relating the comic.  Bad job by the director.  Boo.<br />ACTORS:  One thing I did like -- Bana's performance as Bruce and Sam Elliot as the general were great.  Nick Nolte was just nuts.  Creepy.<br />DISAPPOINTED:  Not what I expected for a Marvel movie.  I had high hopes, having seen the outstanding effort on X2 earlier this summer just after I got back.  I guess the ending was pretty good -- but I don't know since I walked out on worst effort in the recent comic book to film deal from Marvel.  Blah.  I hope they don't let Ang Lee mess up any more of Stan Lee's work.  Are either of ya'll reading this??  Hope so. . .  from a true believer.
B000089RVR|5.0|This is a wonderful cd and a great follow up to &quot;No Angel&quot;. This cd is a learning factor for record companies arista got it right when they signed Dido.Never change a great thing until it is broke.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|First off, I have to say that those who scoff at the movie aren't showing any intelligence.  With that said, this film beautifully combines \\"Alagory of The Cave\\" and Albert Camus' \\"Myth of Sisyphus\\" and writings on existentialism.  Neo is perfectly  portrayed as the absurd hero, who has beaten the odds against despair, although he is doomed to die.  Without going into detail, one should study these writings and then re-evaluate the film.  This film is very brilliantly done, if you are willing to take the time and make the effort to study it philosophically (in which case, most ignorant people could care less because they're lazy).
B0000CABJ1|1.0|When I saw this CD promoted on a recent Advocate magazine, I was in shock and wanted to scream.  The umpteenth greatest hits album??  And two, three, but no more than four bonus aka new tracks?  Is this the diva's way of declaring to the world that she is still around?<br />Don't get me wrong---I have been a fan of Donna since 1977.  But to be presented with another greatest hits package just as an excuse to provide a couple of new songs--or is it the other way around---is an insult to the sensibilities and intelligence of longtime Donna Summer fans like myself.  I begin to wonder if Donna is really behind this, or is it just someone in the recording industry dictating the need for misleading the audience with what looks like a definitive greatest hits package to accompany a couple of dance songs??<br />What is more insulting I think is using yet the same Francesco Scavullo shot that graced the cover (or, in the U.S. case, the inside cover) of the 1978 &quot;Live and More&quot; album, albeit in a mirror image version and a different background color!!  This same picture was also used for the &quot;I Feel Love&quot; remix released in 1995!  The pictures are just as rehashed as the songs are!<br />Perhaps for the younger generation who hasn't heard of Donna Summer, this would be a good primer.  But for us who have been following what she may be up to, this is painful.  Natalie Cole, Gladys Knight, and Aretha Franklin do not seem to fall on this trap!<br />I can almost hear Donna belt out: &quot;Someone left my talent in the rain, I don't think that I can take it, cuz it took so long to create it, and I'll never have another greatest hits album again, OH NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
B000002UUX|5.0|I first bought this CD, back in 1999, during the time of the &quot;Risk&quot; album. I heard from a friend that it was one of their heaviest albums ever. Upon it's purchase, I could not stop playing this disc, and could not beleive the awesome solos by Marty Friedman and Dave Mustaine, the pounding bass of David Ellefson, and Nick Menza's incredible drumming. The album contains atleast three Megadeth classics.<BR>  The opener &quot;Holy Wars...The Punishment Due&quot; is a metal masterpiece, which is probably the song that earned Megadeth the recognition that they deserved back in the early 1990's. &quot;Hangar 18&quot; and &quot;Tornado of Souls&quot; are also considered to be Megadeth hits by many of their longtime fans. These tracks could have easily been released as worthy instrumentals because the guitar work blows the lyrical content away. I don't really tend to focus my attention on Dave Mustain'e lyrics, but do make sure to pay attention to the instrumentation represented in each song.<BR>  For beginner's, this disc and &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;, &quot;Capitol Punishment&quot;, and &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; would make great additions to any metal fan's collection. Also take a listen to &quot;Lucretia&quot;, &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot;, &amp; &quot;Poison Was the Cure.&quot; Actually, all of these 9 tracks are great in their own right.
B0000AMRJC|3.0|I THINK UNIVERSAL NEEDS TO TAKE NOTES FROM WHOEVER REMASTERED THE SOUND ON THE FIRST TERMINATOR DVD.THE TERMINATOR TRACK WAS OLD CRAPPY AND MONO AND MGM TURNED IT INTO A POWERHOUSE OF GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS SONIC CLARITY ETC.THIS SCARFACE DVD THE PICTURE IS QUIT GOOD .BUT THE SOUND IS EL CRAPPO.THE DTS TRACK IS A LITTLE MORE BETTER THAN THE DOLBY DIGITAL.BUT OVERALL IT STILL SOUNDS FLAT.I THINK IF YOU WANNA SAVE ELECTRICITY JUST USE YOUR TV SPEAKERS TO WATCH THIS FLICK CUZ THERE IS NO SENSE IN TURNING ON YOUR RECIEVER UNLESS YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC ON HERE WHICH DOESNT SOUND TOO BAD.BUT THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC AND IS DEFINATLEY WORTH BUYING JUST FOR THE EXTRAS AND PICTURE QUALITY AND THE NEAT DVD PACKAGING.
B000068QZK|5.0|This Ozzy CD is an under-rated masterpiece of metal! With tracks like &quot;Crazy Babies&quot;, &quot;Miracle Man&quot;, &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Breakin' All the Rules&quot;, and &quot;Bloodbath in Paradise&quot;, it blows away his 1986 album &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot; away. &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot; was considered to be garbage to many rockers of the mid '80's, but this 1988 disc was critically acclaimed to be a return-to-form release by the ex-member of Black Sabbath.<BR>With help from Zakk Wylde (guitars), Bob Daisley (bass), and Randy Castillo (drums), Ozzy kicked his glam era in the face and delivered a 9-track metal album that was awesome and full of energy! The new 2002 edition features a live version of the hit single &quot;Miracle Man (1989)&quot; &amp; &quot;The Liar&quot;, which was previously released on a promo-only disc in 1990. These 11 tracks are worth the cash, and still stand the test of time some 15 years later.
B000000OQF|5.0|This rocks like no other album you will find.the thing i love about AFD is that it was not made keeping any buyer in mind thus the music,lyrics and the general anger of GNR came through brilliantly.axl shows his vocal range and slash gives a glimpse of what he would later become in sweet child and paradise city. this album is not my favourite collection of gnr songs but for its rawness,honesty and its pure a** kicking factor it is my favourite hard rock album EVER.
B000006ZDR|5.0|Eventhough this album was released some 22 years ago, &quot;Mob Rules&quot; stands as one of Black Sabbath's best albums without the aid of Ozzy Osbourne. Ronnie James Dio does a great job on vocals, and presents a much more interesting vocal range than anything Ozzy put out in the 1970's. The tracks &quot;Turn Up the Night&quot;, &quot;The Sign of the Southern Cross&quot;, and &quot;The Mob Rules&quot; are the obvious hits, but who could forget &quot;Country Girl&quot;, &quot;Over &amp; Over&quot;, &amp; &quot;Falling Off the Edge of the World.&quot;<BR>These songs really rock, and illustrate the talents of Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi, Vinny Appice, and Dio. &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell (1980)&quot; released 2 years earlier was also good, but not great.<BR>Many of it's songs were filler, but &quot;Mob Rules&quot; is a consistant and enjoyable album from beginning to end. Anyone who enjoys Black Sabbath, Dio, Rainbow, and early Ozzy, will love this CD for it's heaviness on such tunes as &quot;Voodoo&quot; or it's non-stop rockers like the title cut &quot;The Mob Rules.&quot;
0060925000|5.0|It is a few years after independence and partition in India.  Meet the members of the  middle class, you will recognize them, and this book will give you a chance to consider them in a tale of the caliber of BUDDENBROOKS or WAR AND PEACE.  The quality of the book is extraordinarily high, hence the comparisons.  This family saga sprawls and there are a lot of exotic names to identify.  Fortunately there is a chart at the beginning of the book.<br />The story opens with the wedding of Pran and Savita.  Savita is the daughter of Mrs. Rupa Mehra, a widow.  Her sons are Arun and Varun.  There is another daughter, Lata.  The new wife arranges to melt down the ceremonial medals of her father-in-law.  The jeweler and everyone else counsel caution, but she persists in her wish to liquidate the gift of her mother-in-law, the widow.  Arun writes of the catastrophe and the family is duly horrified.  <br />The title, A SUITABLE BOY, derives from an expression for a marriage partner in the context of arranged marriages.  Mrs. Rupa Mehra is seeking a suitable boy for her daughter Lata.  This requires a good deal of investigation on her part, and the consent of Lata who is becoming a modern sort of person-- she attends the university, while remaining a dutiful sort of daughter.  <br />Lata learns a boy she knows at the university is a Muslim.  Her friend tells her to read P.G. Wodehouse by way of solace.  Lata's friend, the boy Kabir, is a distinctly unsuitable boy in her mother's eyes, and so they leave Brahmpur and go to Calcutta.<br />One of the families fell from wealth in Lahore to virtual destitution after 1947 following the partition.  In the nascent democracy there is a struggle of form over substance.  There is a parliamentary debate over the compensation scheme employed for the taking of private lands and residences.  We are reminded  of attributes carried over from colonialism  in education, sport, and the exercise of democratic political values.  Excellent and colorfulspeeches are presented covering the details of land reform.  <br />Mrs. Rupa Mehra now travels from Calcutta to Delhi.  Meanwhile the son of a politician, the Revenue Minister, participates in a wolf hunt while visiting his Urdu teacher  Abdur Rasheed.  The two had traveled from Brahmpur to the house of Rasheed's father near Baitar.  The father is a zamindar, a landlord.  The area of Muslim League activism is filled with landlords resorting to coercion to overcome the effects of land reform.  Maan, the minister's son, acts with such rage that he nearly murders an agent of the Nawab Sahib.  During the visit Maan becomes a sort of universal confidant.<br />The constitutionality of the Zamindari Act, the land reform measure, is litigated.  British, Indian, and American precedents are cited since India, as distinguished from Britain and as is the case in the United States, has a written constitution.  A major issue is the delegation of powers.  A Raja is removed from the courtroom.  The watch and ward staff is called.  The law is upheld as constitutionally valid.<br />Dipankur Chatterji makes a pilgrimage to the Ganges for Pul Mela.  A holy man, Sanaki Baba becomes interested in him and seeks his company.  A tent city is formed on the sands.  Unfortunately at the festival in the crush of people there is a stampede and deaths and injuries result.  A Kapoor grandson, Maan's nephew, is injured.<br />Mrs. Mahesh Kapoor is a prize-winning gardener.  Mr. Mahesh Kapoor resigns from the ministry and from the Congress Party.  At the time it is hoped that Nehru will do the same and form a new party.  This does not happen and later Mr. Mahesh Kapoor rejoins the Congress Party.  Maan returns to Brahmpur, and Pran, Savita's husband, falls ill with asthma and a heart condition.  Both Lata and Kabir are to appear in a Shakespeare play at the university.  <br />In a complication of emotions and familial ties and loves Maan is faced with a serious charge of assault and his Urdu teacherdisintegrates mentally.  Maan's conduct has poltical consequences for his father and his mother dies seemingly from the shock of the events.  The story ends, a Tolstoyan touch, with another marriage.<br />The novel is about four families, Muslim and Hindu, in Calcutta, Brahmpur, and Delhi who plan for the careers, education, and marriages of their sons and daughters.  All of the families are bound by ties of obligation and expectation to their respective communities, and seek to enable and persuade the children to step into their shoes.  This does not always happen for reason the younger people oftentimes seek freedom and adventure and desire to obtain the means of artistic expression.  Both C.P. Snow and Jane Austen have written about the career moves of youth, and this book, in some respects, resembles their work.  It is marvelous and energetic.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|\\"2Fast 2Furious\\" is the only film I can remember that is guilty of committing two hyperboles in a single title.  There's nothing particularly fast nor particularly furious - unless you count the audience - about this sequel to \\"The Fast and the Furious,\\" the original box office sensation that really wasn't all that great to begin with but which looms up like an action movie \\"War and Peace\\" when placed up against this installment.  And what, may I ask, has happened to John Singleton?  Is this really the best the director of \\"Boyz `n the Hood\\" has to offer?<br />The plotting is little more than an excuse to spin out a series of interminable and mind-numbingly boring race sequences, none of which score very high on the credibility meter.  Particularly ludicrous is a scene featuring a Florida drug kingpin, - whom one would naturally assume would want to be keeping as low a public profile as possible as he goes about conducting his business - who instead sends a bunch of his boys out to wreak havoc and splatter carnage all along the freeway simply to determine which of them would be the most reliable driver to help him sneak his laundered money out of the country!  Indeed, the overall storytelling is so messy that one can't even figure out who is chasing who after awhile.  Moreover, the \\"acting\\" consists basically of people hanging tough and strutting their stuff ad nauseam.<br />\\"2Fast 2Furious\\" can't even account for its badness by pleading low aspirations.  After all, \\"American Graffiti\\" was also a movie about \\"people driving their cars.\\"  But oh what a difference between that film and this!
B00008OWZC|5.0|Despite having a great live reputation, \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" doesn't really show Led Zep at their best.  To rectify this, Jimmy Page put together \\"How The West Was Won\\", which was recorded during the same tour which produced \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", but the band is in much better and fresher form during these LA shows.<br />The first disc is in many ways the best since it shows Led Zep at its tighest.  Jimmy Page breaks it down in \\"Heartbreaker\\", even throwing a little \\"Bourree\\" from Jethro Tull into his solo.  The band tears through the rest of songs.  John Paul Jones plays some mean mandolin during their three-song acoustic set.<br />Disc two has the lengthy \\"Dazed and Confused\\".  Though it's long, it never bores.  Led Zep's jams are tight and interesting, something not even Miles Davis's jazz-rock fusion songs of the same time could always be.  The only song I don't like is the 19 minutes of \\"Moby Dick\\" which sounds dated.  John Bonham is a great drummer, but he can't make 19 minutes worthwhile listening.<br />Disc three opens with Led Zep's homage to rock & blues - the \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" medley.  Again, Led Zep jams well, and throws in a few early rock songs into the medley.  \\"Rock and Roll\\" and \\"The Ocean\\" are played straight-forward, then there's a bluesy jam on \\"Bring It On Home\\".<br />The band is tight, virtuosic, and full of energy.  It's a key recording that every fan of rock should own.
B00003CXRM|5.0|homer's odyssey... in '30s america? this is truly an amazing show with lots and lots and lots of terribly funny moments. incredible writing with exquisite photography and music score. admittedly, i haven't even read homer's story, which this movie is based on but what few i know of it is wackily portrayed by the coen brothers.<br />and my, my, my... george clooney keeps on making better and better movies. never actually thought he could make it past er but well, he did.<br />i especially love the way they make the travelling prophet a recurring character in this movie and how it finally tied up in the end. although on second thought there seems to be a lot of characters going in and out of the movie at bullet speed - and at first seems like they're just in for the fun - until the end when they all had a part to play.<br />i get a headache just thinking of all those characters i try to keep up with. but hey... everything makes sense in the end... and what a fulfilling end it was. makes me feel squishy all over. just joking... it's an amazing movie, nonetheless and it introduces me to a whole new musical genre.
B00000I8UF|4.0|This album is a good mixture of songs and playing.  Most of the songs have repeating phrases which stretch over 8, 12 or 16 bars.  Lee Morgan's trumpet playing is excellent, and Benny Golson is no slouch on sax.  <br />&quot;Moanin'&quot; has a catchy basic riff.  &quot;Are You Real?&quot; and &quot;Along Came Betty&quot; have longer melodies which were nicely written by Benny Golson.  &quot;Drum Thunder Suite&quot; is a chance for Art to show his stuff, and is a dramatic song.  &quot;Blues March&quot; is exactly what its title promises.  &quot;Come Rain Or Come Shine&quot;, like most of the others has a long melody riff.  <br />Everything comes together well, I highly recommend this one.
B00004XQ83|5.0|i love the movie, and half of it rests on the strength of the soundtrack. this cd introduces me to a whole new musical genre that i never thought i'd come to appreciate. a definite keeper.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Hail to the Thief has two basic songs - band songs and programmed songs.  The band songs are &quot;2+2=5&quot;, &quot;Go to sleep&quot;, &quot;Where I end and you begin&quot;, There there&quot;, &quot;A punchup at a wedding&quot;, &quot;Myxomatosis&quot;, &quot;Scatterbrain&quot;, and &quot;A wolf at the door&quot;.  The programmed songs are &quot;Sit down stand up&quot;, &quot;Sail to the moon&quot;, &quot;Backdrifts&quot;, &quot;The Gloaming&quot;, and &quot;I will&quot;.  &quot;We suck young blood&quot; channels Tom Waits.  Radiohead is in fine form - all the songs are good, if mostly more melancholy.<br />My favorite songs are more likely to be the livlier &quot;band&quot; songs.  &quot;Where I end&quot; maintains a very effective tension throughout with soaring (I wish I could think of a better adjective) keyboards and scratchy rhythm guitars.  &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; might be my favorite because of its heaviness.
B0000025YL|5.0|Classic Euro metal, one of the heralds of thrash and ultra heavy aggression in rock music. Musically these guys are like a well oiled machine and Restless and Wild presents them at their best! The double bass barrage and twin guitar attack still hold up surprisingly well even twenty years after the fact. Classical and exotic influences abound in the guitar work of Wolf Hoffman (an often woefully overlooked guitar hero in the great german tradition of the Schenker bros. and Uli Roth) and the screeching piercing wail of lead vocalist (gnomelike) Udo Dirkschneider is sure to repulse the faint of heart but delight metal maniacs. Lyrically they are no worse than what would be expected from this era of metal and in some spots a sophistication perhaps inate to the european sensibility actually makes it's presense felt (especially in the breakthrough follow up though musically less intense Balls to the Wall). Don't let any one convince you otherwise no metal collection is complete without Restless and Wild! A must have for all serious fans of the metal form.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|Great cd, with classic rock songs from the past.  The two school of rock songs are amazing and easily get stuck in your head, and makes you listen to morea and more!
B00000DFSK|5.0|bono has the best voice, thats one of the great things of this album. then, the tracks are just awesome and just u2 all the way. i have no complaints. one of the best tracks has got to be &quot;pride [in the name of love]&quot;... that guitar just tears it up... &quot;desire&quot; is another one to be noticed indeed...<br />if you are a true u2 fan, you will love this compilation, hands down :)
B000024BW6|5.0|talk about a Artist that understood Words&Music? Billy Joel comes rock solid on this Album.\\"the Stranger\\" is my cut from Him.I enjoyed the energy&edge that Billy Joel had on His Albums back in the 70's.Sharp on point arrangements&straight to the point lyrics.
B000002LND|5.0|what's there to say, all that is found here are all the great madonna classics, when she first started off in her quest to &quot;rule the world&quot;, as she once said herself. there wasn't ONE track i did not know when i purchased the cd, and perhaps that is why i bought it. because i know that these are songs i will always remember and will always enjoy listening and singing along to. &quot;la isla bonita&quot;, &quot;vogue&quot;, &quot;rescue me&quot; and &quot;justify my love&quot; are some of the best ones present... to be found in all collector's belongings!
B000083E79|5.0|This CD has all the classic Cher songs like &quot;Dark Lady&quot;, &quot;Half Breed&quot;, &quot;Gypsies,Tramps and Thieves&quot;, and&quot;Bang Bang&quot;. There's over 20 different songs including songs with Sonny &amp; Cher plus some of her newest hits like &quot;Believe&quot; &quot;Song for the Lonely&quot; and &quot;different kind of Love Song.&quot; And ofcourse my two personal favorites &quot;If I could turn back Time&quot; &amp; &quot;Just Like Jesse James.&quot;
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|although i have to admit that i expected heavier songs on this second effort, it is a success nonetheless. this album does not sound like anything else out there, although there are some easy tunes such as &quot;weak and powerless&quot; which makes a great first single. my personal favs would have to be the package, the vanishing, pet and gravity. i personally think that the vanishing is unlike any of their previous songs, but so are others on the album such as the nurse who loved me, even though i have to admit the latter is a track i would rather skip. i heard that &quot;the nurse&quot; is supposed to be a &quot;romantic&quot; song but to me it just seems as a song that has a rather sarcastic twist to it and to me is anything BUT romantic... my 2 cents.<br />its different from mer de noms, but definitely something you should own and will enjoy playing over and over.<br />happy listening!
B0000C7PQK|2.0|I've waited all these years for this?  I'm a die-hard Enigma fan and this album is really disappointing.  I'm all for change; change for the better, not for the worse.  The only track I liked was &quot;From East To West&quot;.  The rest sound either boring or something you hear on a cheesy pop radio station. Nothing interesting in this album at all. Enigma has, or rather had a unique sound; yes I do miss the chants, operas and the samplings.  Thats what I expect from Enigma. Listening to the last track &quot;Follow The Sun&quot;, I thought I was listening to the Dixie Chicks sing. I guess I have to wait another three years for the 6th album to come out to HOPEFULLY get some good ol' Enigma music. Disappointing album unfortunately.
B000002N3J|5.0|this is a cd full of ballads, and good ones at that. another side of madonna. an unexpected one, perhaps. i view this as the &quot;layed back&quot; madonna, the fragile side of her showing she is experiencing love, and everything that goes along with it. the best tracks are &quot;i want you [w/massive attack], &quot;this used to be my playground&quot;, and &quot;crazy for you&quot;. the track w/massive attack is definitely a hit, a unique song and style for madonna.<br />if you feel &quot;mushy&quot;, you'll listen to this cd :)
B000092ZYX|5.0|Take all the parts of radiohead's past efforts--and you would get the beautiful hail to the thief.<br />Best album of 2003----get it, love it and cherish it..
B000002U6E|5.0|this has got to be my favorite enigma cd... it has similar beats already heard in the past, but goes a step further by mixing it up a bit more... it has upbeat tracks and soothing ones, which are great to listen to no matter your mood... the standout tracks are &quot;eyes of truth&quot; and &quot;return to innocence&quot;...<br />thank God for enigma; in this record, music is taken to another level :)
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I consider myself a lucky guy...through extremely good fortune, I was able to be in London in 2002 and attend The Concert For George in person.  It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience.    So when the DVD came out I was thrilled to see that one disc has the ENTIRE concert while the other disc has the theatrical release and interviews/features.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched the full concert, just basking in the unbelievable musicianship and the love that all of the players had for George.    There are so many amazing moments in the concert but a couple that stand out for me, as they did that night:  -Sam Brown's incredible performance of \\"Horse To Water.\\"  The crowd had been mostly respectful and somewhat restrained all night, but Sam blew everyone away with this song.  I'd known of her peripherally because she'd sung backing vocals on George's 2000 remake of \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" but this was something special.    -Paul McCartney's emotional rendition on acoustic guitar of \\"All Things Must Pass.\\"  I'd seen him do the ukele version of \\"Something\\" during his U.S. 2002 tour, so I knew that was coming, but I was totally taken by surprise by him doing this.  In many ways I've thought of ATMP as one of George's \\"eulogies\\" on the Beatles, so to hear Paul sing it with so much feeling was bittersweet, yet exciting.    Bottom line: this a 5-star DVD that needs to be in any music lover's collection.
B000002NJS|5.0|when i first heard this album, i thought, &quot;of all things i knew madonna could do, i had no idea she could do this...&quot; i love the way this cd has this techno/trance feel to it, again something that i never incorporated with madonna in the past. to me she definitely proved she can pull it off as though she's been doing it her whole life. i have to say though that after this record, i haven't found much interest in her work... however, i can't stress enough how great this cd is. the standout tracks include &quot;swim&quot;, &quot;nothing really matters&quot; and &quot;the power of goodbye&quot;... i would have liked to see madonna release &quot;swim&quot; simply because it seems like a song w/a more controversial tone to it, something that would go great with her, and then the song is just amazing with the echo of the ocean waves in the background... and of course, it is always nice to hear a mother singing to her child, so &quot;little star&quot; shows us madonna crooning in memory of her daughter...<br />something worth checking out :)
0345347951|5.0|This is yet another book I would tack up there as being among the best. <br />Even though this was written in the early 50's, the language Clarke uses makes it feel new.<br />It's concise, to the point, and eeirly prophetic. <br />It accomplishes a very hard task as well: merging the idea of evolution with the idea of God. Clarke pulls it off, and demonstrates why he is among the best writers, sci-fi or not, who has ever lived.<br />Read it now!
B000002URV|5.0|where do i begin? i never thought that listening to this genre of music would be this soothing and calming... my parents always listened to this record when i was young, so thankfully it worked into my blood so now i simply love to put this record on and be swept away each time... it is unlike anything else out there, and it combines so many different styles of music into one great composition... &quot;sadeness&quot; is a classic hit...<br />put it on, and be ready to experience something new...
0385474547|5.0|The story of a 'strong man', a prominent and fierce member of a West African tribe, the Ibo. Okonkwo is a self-made man and highly respected. He does not tolerate weakness and fear, ruling his household with a heavy hand. Tragic events test his endurance to the breaking point.<br />I do not recall having ever been so deeply affected by a single book (with a possible exception of To Kill a Mockingbird). This is one to really get you into a contemplative mood. I loved Achebe's writing style and his descriptions of Nigerian tribal life. You really get to know the culture and Okonkwo through the book and though you may dislike the main character because of his temper, I guarantee the ending will have you pensive for at least a little while.
B00000DFRS|5.0|can anything negative be said of whitney? she has the greatest voice; if i could sing like that i would not shut up for a second... i feel that this is her last album that is worth giving her the attention she deserves, though. i do not know if her private life or whatever you would like to call it, has affected her music, but i feel this album draws the line as to where she made great music. nothing following this album caught my attention, and i am sad to see it that way. however, this cd might in fact make up for all that, because it is simply that good. &quot;it's not right but it's ok&quot; has a great tune, and &quot;heartbreak hotel&quot; is sung with two other great artists as well. i also enjoy &quot;get it back&quot; because it has a great beat to it... i doubt any whitney fan will find anything displeasing in this album, it simply has her name written all over it...<br />if you don't own it yet, you should!
0441003257|5.0|The Antichrist has been born and the Apocalypse is imminent. The hosts of Heaven and Hell couldn't be happier, ready for the battle they've been waiting for since the fall of Lucifer-- all except Crowley the demon and Aziraphale the angel, that is. They've been down on the earth since the beginning and have grown rather fond of it. Question is, will they be able to put a stop to it?<br />By far the funniest book I've ever read. It's a welcome change from the heavier stuff I usually read. The combined talents of Gaiman and Pratchett really have put out a first-rate book, clever and wonderfully satirical all the way through!<br />The plot is excellent and the colorful characters oven in are charming. We have the unlikely alliance of Crowley and Aziraphale, a rather unworldy Odd Couple; Anathema Device, professional descandant and occultist; Sergeant Shadwell, in charge of the Witchfinder Army; Newt Pulsifer, wannabe computer technician and reluctant Witchfinder; Adam, the Antichrist but otherwise a typical eleven year old boy; and a whole host of other characters!<br />If you need a laugh, check this story out. If you want a clever and unique story, check it out. If you enjoy good books in general, check it out!
B00005JLTN|5.0|Lets get one thing straight. Matrix Reloaded was a movie meant for the fans!! So if you did not like the first part and consider it just as an \\"ordinary\\" movie, dont watch the sequal cause youll probably dislike it. Just stick to the LOTR (kids/disney) movies and you will be fine. If you are a fan of the first matrix (UNQUESTIONABLY THE GREATEST ACTION/SCI-FI MOVIE EVER!) your gonna LOVE THIS :D  This movie takes the Matrix to a whole new level. Not only does it have new villians and new story plots but once again we see effects that no other movie will ever come close to creating.. not for the next 10-20 years (or until Matrix 1999 special edition:digitally re-mastered sometime in 2020 )<BR>I too am getting real sick of these anti-matrix groups that go on and on about how bad the movie was. The thing is, your \\"Lesser\\" mind either does not (or refuses to) understand whole concept of the Matrix. I only have one thing to say to you people: FREE-YOUR-MINDS! oh, and the women in this movie are so Gorgeouse it hurts ;o)   5 stars! How do you like that?
B0000025RI|5.0|What can I say about this album, only &quot;GREAT!&quot;  This is the greatest album of all time.  Every track is a great hit.  Funny thing, this album still sells.  Michael made history.
B000089RVR|3.0|Life for rent is not a bad album, by any means. It's of comparable quality to a lot of what's out there. But it does not come close to equalling No Angel, compared to which it is merely mediocre. No Angel, for me, had several truly outstanding tracks: 'Here With Me', 'Hunter', and the over-played-but-only-because-it-was-so-good-in-the-first-place 'Thankyou'. Life for Rent lacks anything to compare with these. No Angel I bought after hearing 'Here With Me' on the radio. I couldn't get it out of my mind, and just _had_ to have the album, which I subsequently bought and thoroughly enjoyed. Life for Rent I bought on the strength of its predecessor, and I can't say that there is any track on it which would have compelled me to get it othwerwise. To quote a line from one of her songs (See you when you're 40): 'Well if you had walked past me today I wouldn't have picked you out'. That rather sums up my feelings for this album.<br />In the lead up to its release, one of the more common adjectives being thrown about was 'maturity', and I would not deny that there is a greater sense of this in the lyrics. But unless you have lyrics that would be memorable even just taken as written poetry, it won't be enough to carry a song. And this is where I think Life for Rent falls down - the music just isn't as as vibrant as in No Angel. It's still enjoyable, and I'll repeat again that this is not a bad album. But unlike No Angel, there weren't any tracks where I found myself wanting to go back and play them over again.<br />To anyone who's thinking of buying it based on a love for 'No Angel'... well, I guess there's enough positive reviews here that there must be a fairly good chance of you also coming to love 'Life for Rent'. But if practicable, I'd recommend borrowing a friend's CD first, or downloading MP3s for some of the more popular tracks (the ones I most enjoyed were 'don't leave home', 'sand in my shoes' and 'this land is mine'). Because whereas I'd recommend anyone grab No Angel, Life for Rent is a definite 'try before you  buy'.
B00008DDSC|2.0|I see all the great reviews for this movie and I just don't understand. I forced myself to sit through the whole thing and it never got better. What a waste of time!!
630446651X|1.0|What an awful movie.  Mel Brooks is arguably one of the best comedy directors of all time.  Why did he do this?  Why did he waste his time?  I know that other reviewers like this, but compared to say a &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; this movie was horribly disappointing.  I mean there were some great 'in jokes' as usual, but they were so few and far between that they were not worth looking for.  It just wasn't funny.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I'll tell you upfront Im a Madonna fan but not obsessed by admiring everthing single thing she does just becasue she puts her fingerprint on it. Ray of light was incredibly unique and brilliant - a venture into something new and exciting..I looked forward to this CD, and have now tried listening to it at least 4 times and can never make it past lets say 5 songs before I once again brand it as FILLER from someone who is a much more talented - both vocally and intuitively  - she has reinvented herself - unfortunatly as someone churning out whatever she can to make a buck... vocals are weak, sound is obnoxious, and every bit of the album sounds the same....  If you disagree, Im sure you had to own the two movies above...
0060007737|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my business coach and I have not regretted the purchase ever. At first, I was a little concerned with the strange looking cover with the difficult to read font and the bright colors. My concern was that if they know so much about branding, why this kind of a cover. <br />But my concerns end with the cover as everything in between was very well laid out, backed by common sense and facts based on real companies. There are several examples used on every page to explain the total of 33 immutable laws (22 regular and 11 internet). We all intuitively understand branding because we are consumers and hence experience on a daily basis our purchasing being swayed by branding. So it was very nice to be able to read this perfect book on branding and understand so much in such a short time. It won't take more than a few hours to read this book cover to cover. <br />Let me share an example law without spoiling the book for you - #4 Internet Law: The Law of the Proper Name explains how proper names are better than common names for Internet branding. The clear proof of this is in the common names that never took off - drugs.com, university.com, wine.com, telephone.com, etc. and the proper names that did take off - priceline.com, amazon.com, etc. And I really like the explanation for why this law works. <br />So if you are a small business owner who can influence the branding of your business, products and services - go ahead and buy a copy of this book as you won't regret it. Of course, the content of this book is not restricted to small businesses. I am sure almost anyone involved in the branding efforts of the companies they work for will find it useful.<br />Good luck!
B000002WU9|2.0|I don't know why so many people are fans of this album , i bought a used copy really cheap and have enjoyed many verses from Raekwon on Wu-Tang joints and others howevever I felt hugeley dissapointed when I heard it...<br />The beats all sound the same, and I would hardly call them beats... RZA does the worst work he has ever done.<br />I would advice u to listen to this album before u buy it, couse even if you're a Wu-Tanger the chances are u will not like this one...
0743424425|5.0|I read this book outside over the summer in 80 degree weather, but despite the heat, I still had goosebumps and couldn't help but shivering. I couldn't put it down... I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a good psychological thriller.
B00006SFLV|5.0|It's impossible to overstate just how good this show is. Watching it again after so many years, I kind of expected to see a slew of flaws that escaped my notice before. But to my delight it's just as well written, acted, and produced as I remembered. If you have seen this show before, you can't help but want to buy it. And I heartily recomend that you do.
079213690X|5.0|Braveheart is an incredible epic drama starring Mel Gibson as William Wallace.  The story takes place in the late 13th Century when Wallace, a Scottish commoner, returns to his homeland.  In an unlikely turn of events, Wallace unites and leads an untrained army to overthrow the new English King (Edward the Longshanks) in order to restore freedom to Scotland.<br />Not for the faint-hearted, Braveheart's war sceens are graphic and powerful.  However, the bloodshed doesn't overshadow the intense passion that brings this film to life.  It is filled to the brim with love, loss, and undying patriotrism.<br />Winning an amazing five Oscars, Braveheart is a must see.

B00009TB5G|5.0|I have always been a big fan of SciFi and Fantasy genre movies. I saw the movies before I read the books. I think that was the way to go because I loved the movies and then the books had so much more detail and slightly different twists in the story but basically the same. Here are the things that struck me most in the Two Towers:<BR>- Graphics were great as usual.<BR>- Gandalf returns more powerful that ever.<BR>- Aragorn walks in thru the double doors at Helm's Deep<BR>- The Warg battle had great CGI<br />- Gollum rocks (Andy Serkis was great as the talent behind gollum<BR>- The Battle Helm's deep was overwhelming. I love seiges. <BR>- Gandalf rides downhill to kick some Uruk and Orc butt !!!<br />Overall, though there were many additions and many deletions to certain story elements within the books, I think as far as making a movie and captivating a movie going crowd as well as the not so fussy majority of the tolkien fan base, Peter Jackson did a helluva job. The plot of the moive was well thought of and I welcome the changes that saved us from too much detail as in the books. I like reading the books and imagining things and thats where detail helps, not in the movies. But the movies have a great amount of detail too and the Extended Edition always satisfies that desire for a little bit more. I plan to own both the theatrical and extended versions of all three movies. I wish they would have made the Hobbit also...... now I'm aksing for too much :-)<br />I would give this movie and the extended a hundred stars if I could, but I guess five will have to suffice for now..

B0000AXE8I|5.0|Yes, i've heard endless moaning about the whole orgy/zion/sex thing and that people were laughing in the movie theater.  I swear it didn't happen to me, but i guess certain individuals felt otherwise.  Every great movie comes with at least one thing reviewers gripe about, so whatever.  It's like 5 awkward minutes out of a 2 hour film.  The movie kicks off hard and explosive, and i'm glad they slowed down the beginning of the movie to take the time to explain the philosophy of the matrix and the irony of Zion's existence, because otherwise the audience would be absolutely clueless for the next hour and 40 minutes.  And yes, there's certain people that can't understand the movie at all, and their intelligence isn't to blame, it's just that this is a movie that pushes an audience's reaction where you get those moments of epiphany.  After that though, the movie speeds up and refuses to slow down.  Fight scene after fight scene.  Insane special effects that would make ILM fall to it's knees.  100 Agent Smiths against Neo, good god.  The Freeway Chase has to be seen to be believed.  And there's about 3 dozen more incidents where my jaw just dropped to the floor.  This is a Middle Film, and it's only right that it ends with a huge cliffhanger to make us curse and beg for 6 months till the final installment.  This is one of the Classic Movie Trilogies of all time, and whether you like it or not, you're probably going to view the next one.  Don't understand what the Matrix is?  Then watch Reloaded.  Wanna see the massive scale of Zion?  Watch Reloaded.  Critics aren't very good movie judges, so take my advice, you won't regret it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series follows Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Division from training through the end of WWII. Casting, character development, story, cinematography...everything about it outclasses every theater WWII movie I've ever seen including Saving Private Ryan, which doesn't hold a candle to this.

You WILL cherish this as your most prized DVD in your collection.
B000001F76|5.0|Hank Williams, Sr., simply is country music, and this collection of forty of his greatest songs is enough to keep any fan happy for a long time.  These are songs you can listen to over and over again without growing tired of them, and I have certainly found myself doing exactly that on several occasions over the years.  The guy turned honky-tonkin' into an art form, yet he could melt your heart with songs of love and loss; gospel music was another area in which he excelled, although the only gospel song you will find in this collection is a song Hank truly made his own, I Saw the Light.  The widespread appeal and influence of this man is simply amazing; virtually any man, woman, or child can look down this list of 40 songs and recognize any number of them right off the bat.  Hank has influenced and inspired musicians of virtually all genres, and he truly will live forever.<br />These tracks really don't need any introduction or commentary from me.  Jambalaya; I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry (which Elvis called the saddest song he had ever heard when he performed it during his historic comeback concert in Hawaii); Cold, Cold Heart; Hey, Good Lookin'; Kaw-Liga, Your Cheatin' Heart: these are classics that everyone knows and almost everyone loves.  In my opinion, though, there are even better songs to be found here, songs which may not be as familiar to today's listeners.  For me, nothing beats I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love With You), one of the many songs Hank recorded about unrequited love, although the highly emotional Wedding Bells comes mighty close to matching its somber power.  More standouts on the same theme include They'll Never Take Her Love From Me, Nobody's Lonesome For Me, and You Win Again.  My Son Calls Another Man Daddy is another song high on the emotion factor, and I think Hank's voice is especially solid and clear on this track.  The whole Hank Williams mystique is bundled up and expressed quite impressively in tracks such as Ramblin' Man and Lost Highway.  Nobody sang the blues like Hank did on such classics as Lovesick Blues, Long Gone Lonesome Blues, Moanin' the Blues, and Honky Tonk Blues.<br />I could write a paragraph on every one of these 40 songs.  If you haven't turned a serious ear to Hank Williams before, you owe it to yourself to sample the wares of this traditional country music legend and pioneer.  It is amazing just how much of an influence the man's too-short life has had on music of every kind over the years, and you might well be surprised to learn just how many different types of singers in all sorts of genres list Hank Williams Sr. among their most significant musical influences.  I can't state authoritatively that this is the best Hank collection available, but I feel pretty confident in saying that you are all but guaranteed to enjoy the 40 tracks assembled here.st Highway.

B00006HBUC|3.0|Parts of this movie are okay (particularly the first 15 or so minutes), but other parts are just embarrassing.  I think that just about any person on the planet who saw the old Scooby cartoons when they were still actually broadcast on television should see this movie, but try not to get too worked up about it because....<br />There is almost no attention paid to the power of the old Scooby &quot;franchise&quot;.  Old fans will not quite recognize what they liked so much about the cartoon, new fans will not be able to make the connection to what the old fans were raving about in the first place, etc.<br />No attempt was made to exploit any of the &quot;subversive&quot; subtext of the cartoon (i.e., that Shaggy is always hungry because he's something of a pothead and has the munchies on a regular basis).  There was ample opportunity to dress everyone in this movie in the dreckiest 70's outfits imaginable, which would have been kind of funny.  My guess is that Daphne/Buffy said &quot;no way, I'm not wearing that thing&quot;.  Daphne/Buffy also got her boyfriend onto the set (news flash...Freddie Prinz, Jr. is not convincing as a blond).  It turns out she's responsible for more evil-doing than the vampires give her credit for.<br />Scooby is not an exact duplicate of the cartoon character, even though he is a cartoon.  Scooby's eyes are too big (and too black...maybe Scoob is the one with the recreational drug problem).  Something there is about a live-action film that does not love a cartoon.  Maybe there was a test run performed with a &quot;small-eyed&quot; computer-generated Scooby, and it just didn't look right.  But when millions of people know exactly what Scooby did look like, messing with the formula may not always be the wisest move.<br />But anyhow, it's worth seeing just to be able to talk about it later.  The &quot;protoplasmic heads&quot; are also cool.
0736041850|4.0|Using a simple color-coded schema, Delavier combines sound anatomy with bodybuilding exercises to give a unique perspective that will improve your workouts and expand your mind as well as your muscle size.  Even though the models for the illustrations have the bulky, engorged muscles that accompany chronic steroid supplementation, and are sometimes depicted in the ludicrous pin-striped, post-Flashdance thongwear popular in California gyms in the early 90s, the illustrations are amazing.  The selective use of color makes anatomically relevant highlights leap out.  For example, the reverse wrist curl comes to life as the humerus and extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, extensor ulnaris, ane extensor indicus all are labeled in the context of the lift, so you know exactly what muscles are working while you're doing the movement.
B000002J23|5.0|But fantastic.  Being a Yes fanatic, I am not supposed to like this one but, sorry, I love it.  Drama is just a kicking album.  Enter two members from the Buggles(video killed the radio star) and Chris Squire and Steve Howe at their best!!!!   Trevor Horn's voice fits the music greatly, and Geoff Downes is an amazing keyboardist.  Machine Messiah is a good 10 minute tune band heavy and a totally different sound for Yes and White Car is a cool little thing.  The remaining four tunes are classics, Does it really happen is funky and Into the Lens is another long classic, wow, what a tune.  Trevors voice inflections are awesome!!!   It has some punky overtones to me and is just the best!!!  Run through the light is a great keyboard driven tune and the background vocals of Squire are at an all time high, he is just amazing, voice and bass on this album.  The last tune leaves with a bang, Tempus Fugit is an amazing fast tune with the best Steve Howe riffs ever.  I am a Yes freak and love all of Yes but this album is just different and great.  If you passed on this, do not avoid Drama, a different Yes masterpiece!!!
0060537639|1.0|After laying out $27.95 for this book, it's disconcerting to read in it again and again that the information is incomplete but will be more thorough in the paperback, out soon.<br />Otherwise, it's a farrago of  &quot;must have been&quot;, &quot;probably&quot; and &quot;there is no doubt&quot;. The author spent 15 years on it, but probably he must have been playing golf as well, there is no doubt. <br />Example: He describes a stone stele with a mysterious script carved on it, (which he annoyingly keeps calling &quot;calligraphy&quot;) . He sent it to the Bank of India (this is a research source?) who said it looked like Malayalam, which was now nearly extinct. He dropped it there.<br />Curious  as to why they didn't translate it anyway, I plugged &quot;Malayalam&quot; into my search engine, and in minutes discovered that, far from going extinct, it was the official language of Kerala province, spoken and read by many millions in India. In fact there was an internet course teaching it.<br />This ineptitude cut the legs off all the rest of the &quot;facts&quot; in the book.  <br />Another one that got to me was his claim that the Chinese had negotiated the Northeast passage north of Siberia, based on no other information than his opinion that the Waldseemuller map of  1507 shows details of the north coast of Siberia. &quot;The only logical explanation is...&quot;. The good old Chinese do it again.  <br />Lots of people happened upon North America before Columbus; it was too big to miss.  But none of them stayed. History starts with Columbus. After he returned, lots of other people followed his path. And here we are.<br />Ignore this book, unless you're a big von Daniken fan.
B00005LB9O|5.0|&quot;The Invisible Band&quot; is my favorite album in my CD collection, and probably my all-time favorite CD overall.  It's simplistic, but that's the beauty of it.  Fran Healy's lyrics have so much truth to them, it's amazing.  You end up never wanting the album to end.<BR>Travis really can't be compared to Radiohead or Oasis because their sounds are much gentler and their lyrics have more meaning.  Definitely buy this album, you honestly will never regret it.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Like the previous Perfect Circle album the greatness of this album cannot be expressed by any award or record sales, it is pure acoustic bliss. It has not left my CD player since I bought it. I listen to it about 3-4 x a day. Buy it!!!  If you don't have their first album, go get that too....and buy some Tool albums as well!
B000002L9M|5.0|I bought this album knowing that it was going to sound good, I mean it's Depeche Mode what do you expect? The moment I put the album in and &quot;Black Celebration&quot; started with those dark melodic sounds I was so floored by how powerful it sounded. This album show case the band's talents. The lyrics were written beautifully the vocals were done excellent as well. My current favorite song on this album is probably &quot;stripped&quot;. My favorite changes every time I listen to this album. The songs never get old. This cd in my opinion is timless. I suggest that any DM fan out there who doesn't have this in their collection should definitly add this one in. Definitly NOT a disappointment.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This is no &quot;Mer De Noms.&quot; Though there may be some slight resemblences. A perfect Circle took a differant approach for this CD. There are alot of songs on here that sound very influenced by The Cure ex; The Nurse Who Loved Me. Maynard has displayed that he has even more of a range coming from 2 projects (3 including Pucifer on The Underworld Soundtrack). Over all though this is a fantastic cd with alot of depth but might not be what new coming fans are looking for. ITS NOT ALL LIKE WEAK AND POWERLESS.
0316666343|5.0|After losing my mom, I was searching everywhere for comfort, in every book imaginable.  This was the last book I would've thought could provide a calming, but it did.  It was nice to read another person's perspective of the afterlife.  I recommend this book to everyone, especially those who have just experienced a loss.  The death of child is horrendous, but the author did justice for my peace of mind.
0812968255|5.0|The Meditations are terse statements, aphorisms, notes, even reminders.  Some are like fragmented dialogues, which I find fascinated.  Some are very hard to get a hold of.  Others remarkably clear.  Summarizing them is hard, and surely misleading, but they seem frequently to stand against illusions and mistaken judgments, especially in the face of frustration, desire, fear, and anger.  The positive dimension of this is harder to describe (maybe because I have yet to know it firsthand): calmness, purpose, self-control, and a true reckoning of what will matter in the end, as understood in terms of the harmony and essential order of all things. He can be difficult in places, but at other times it is as though he sees into your soul.  <br />          I think Marcus Aurelius will strike readers very differently based on where they are coming from.  Some readers will resonate with his insistence on self-awareness, equanimity, and responsibility for one's own mental state and reactions.  Other readers will be attracted by his ethical standards, commitment to the common good, and sense of divine harmony in all events.  Others will simply enjoy his sobering reflection and insightful commentary on human nature.  Historians will be fascinated with a look into the mind of a Roman emperor, seemingly untouched by the affairs of state (they are hardly mentioned in the text).   Philosophers will enjoy learning about Stoic thought in praxis and how he's picked up the thought of other Greek thinkers (Epictetus, Chrysippus, Heraclitus, etc).  Perhaps one of the most amazing things is how he might appeal equally to readers from very different backgrounds, a testament to the complexity of his thinking.<br />          This particular edition comes with a very good introduction that answers questions of history, religion, philosophy, and thematic ideas.  I highly recommend it to those interested in Marcus Aurelius and his philosophical thought.  In addition, Gregory Hays is a masterful translator who, I think, has taken care to convey the meaning of the original Greek in appropriate English counterparts.<br />          The first chapter is a beautiful one that describes Marcus Aurelius' gratitude to the many people that have positively influenced him, in each case telling what it is that he gained from them.  Might we do the same someday ourselves?  Though it is highly selective for me to do so (leaving out big chunks of what the book is like, especially the more obviously Stoic in form and content--such as the fleeting transience of life), below are just a few of my favorite quotes.  <br />          &quot;The best revenge is not to be like that.&quot;<br />          &quot;You can hold your breath until you turn blue, but they'll still go on doing it.&quot;<br />          &quot;It was for the best. So nature had no choice but to do it.&quot;<br />          &quot;Forget the future.  When and if it comes, you'll have the same resources to draw on--the same Logos.&quot;<br />          &quot;Remember that our efforts are subject to circumstances; you weren't aiming to do the impossible.  --aiming to do what then?  --To try.  And you succeeded.  What you set out to do is accomplished.&quot;<br />          &quot;Think of yourself as dead.  You've lived your life.  Now take what's left and live it properly.&quot;<br />          &quot;...people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly.  They are like this because they can't tell good from evil.  But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own--not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine.  And so none of them can hurt me.  No one can implicate me in ugliness.  Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him...&quot;
0316926345|5.0|A classic of 20th century British literature and a book one is not likely to ever forget. This is the very sad depiction of an aristocratic family's decline and fall in the years between the two world wars. It is one of those rare novels where the reader doesn't necessarily have to like any of the characters to be moved by them. Through the brittle and rather unsympathetic narration of Charles Ryder, the reader is given glimpses of a world sundered by the hypocrisies of sex, religion, and class and the impending cataclysm of World War Two. We come to know the Marchmain family without really knowing them, much as Charles - an outsider himself - does. Still, this does not deflect from our sympathy for Sebastian's alcoholic devolution or the repressed misery of the tragically beautiful Julia. <br />Read the book and then rent the splendid - and faithful - BBC adaptation starring a young Jeremy Irons, Anthony Andrews, and Diana Quick. Both novel and film will haunt you.
0140277447|5.0|I am neither Chinese nor Japanese. The argument here is not the exact number of people killed, but the manner in which they were killed. I am apalled by the utter lack of morals of the Japanese army and their absolute lack of respect for human life either man, woman or child. While the specifics of the events will never be ironed out, what this book provides is a graphic and deeply disturbing snapshot of one of the darkest moments in the history of mankind. It wasn't long after that the Japanese themselves learnt a painful lesson via Hiroshima and Nagasaki. While it may be very hard for us to comprehend the sadistic behavior of our fellow humans, may God provide comfort to *all* the innocent victims of war.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I was a huge Maiden fan right up to Fear of the Dark, and mainly stopped listening to them with the departure of Bruce, and starting college and being exposed to lots of new music like the Cure, Bahaus, Janes Addiction, Rollins Band, DK's and the like. I was convinced that the music I used to like wasn't cool anymore for a while there, and these days I enjoy many diverse musical styles; Jazz, Hip Hop, Punk, Electronic/DJ stuff, you name it. But I've also come to appreciate how great some of the music I used to listen to before all that still is.  Last month I saw Maiden live for the first time here in San Jose, CA on the 'Give me 'ed till I'm Dead' tour, and was completely blown alway by their energy and precision. If you've ever seen 'Live after Death,' - it was all that and more. This was a few weeks before the release of 'Dance of Death,' and they played 'Wildest Dreams,' - which just rocked live. All of Maiden's strengths as a band that helped them to create incredible albums like 'Powerslave' and 'Somewhere in Time' come into play on Dance of Death. I think the last album I liked this well from start to finish was Tool's 'Laterulus.' I can't wait to hear &quot;No More Lies&quot; live when they come back to California. Up The Irons!
B00006CXXU|4.0|After the release of her first single, &quot;Dirrty&quot;, i thought that Christina had gone off the deep end, and never thought i would be buying this CD. But out of sheer curiosity, i went to her website and listened to the CD. It blew me away. I immediatly went out and bought the CD, and it is one of my favorites. The songs are, as the title song, &quot;stripped&quot; says, no hype, no gloss, just christina, stripped. A beautifully soulful CD, and except for a few songs, powerful and gripping coming from someone so young.
0385335482|5.0|This book was great! It was fabulous. I couldnt help buy book after book! I'm addicted to it and checking the bookstore almost everyday to see if there's something new! <br />If this were turn to a movie, I will definitely support it and I imagine Reese Witherspoon as Becky.<br />Wow...I can't imagine how good this will turn out to be!<br />Readers out there, if you are looking for a book to read and want to have a good laugh and cry be sure to opt for Shopaholic!
B000002VE7|5.0|From Stereotomy One to Stereotomy Two the album is a great mix of fabulous keyboard work, guitar solos and solid voices.    John Miles appears once again on this album and his vocals were the perfect choice for Stereotomy and In the Real World.   Elmer Gantry was fabulous in Limelight!  For those APP fans who may not know, an interesting piece of APP trivia has Canadian figure skaing icon Elvis Stojko skating to Limelight.... a great tribute to the songwriting of Eric Woolfson and Alan Parsons. Graham Dye makes his debut with the APP in a very solid performance on Light of the World which is a great song about a depressed person who is looking for happiness.<br />A fabulous album and one I would highly recommend to those who need a great introduction to the APP.
B000002JS6|5.0|To me AC/DC is the greatest HEAVY METAL band in the world.<BR>They have evrything that defines the genre. Screaming vocals,<BR>razorsharp guitarrifs, pumping baslines, four to the floor drumbeats, naughty lyrics and ofcourse the high speed guitarsolo's of Angus Young. The best guitarist in the world.<BR>They are the best-selling heavy metal band in the world(What they deserve) and this is their best-selling album and rightly so. It's a collection of their best songs. Let's go threw them one by one:<br />-Hells bells: Starts with a bell followed by a minor arpeggio that leads it into the moody song<BR>-Shoot to thrill:This up-tempo song sounds the like the opposite of Hells Bells it sounds glorious and hopeful similar to Judas Priest's Sinner or Nightranger's You can still rock in America<BR>-What do you do for money honey: Mid-tempo headbang metal with a AC/DC's short 'n precise chords flowing over the pumping basline<BR>-Given the dog a bone: Swinging hardrock<BR>-Let me put my love into you: slower moody metal song with turned upside down chords<BR>-back in black: Rock 'n roll anthem with a Led Zeppelinish break in the middle<BR>-You shook me all night long: Jolly rock anthem with unforgetable chorus<BR>-Have a drink on me: Bluesy metal about Bon Scott's death<BR>-Shake a leg: Fast rock 'n roller remenisent of Deep Purple<BR>-Rock 'n roll ain't noise pollution: Bluesy rocker<br />One of the greatest albums in rock 'n roll history.<BR>If you don't own this album  you are not a HEAVY METAL FAN
B000066HI4|5.0|There is no way anyone should over look this record as one of the defining Alt-Country releases of the 90's and easily one of the best records.  As soon as you put this record on the mood will be set till the end.  It is a dark record and moves at a rather slow pace, but his voice, lyrics, and the whole atmosphere of the record will drag you in.  This and the Soft Bulletin have to be the top two releases of that year, make sure to get both.
6305546789|5.0|Very Good And Scary Movie So Cool
B000002JST|5.0|This album couldn't have had a better title. At the time when this came out there were a lot of trendy styles threatening heavy metal's position in the rock world. Wimpy styles like punk, disco, funk, and new wave were trying to stop heavy metal and lay it to rest. But ofcourse there's always gonna be hardrockers whant to hear some honoust rock 'n roll and is exactly what AC/DC delivers. What also explaines the title.<BR>AC/DC's flew straight into the face of fashion with this record and showed heavy metal was alive and kicking. In the punk period AC/DC was one of the most hated bands with their blues-based hardrock. Just like with other metal bands they were considerd as being totaly backword and they were considerd  just like many hardrock bands as not being realy tough and only acting as if it is agresive. Very ignorant because Let There Be Rock blew most of the debut albums of those punkbands that come out in the same period to smithereens. Heavy Metal wasn't gonna die. In many ways &quot;LTBR&quot; was the blueprint of eighties metal. All those hardrock bands of the time like Accept,Krokus,Saxon,Y&amp;T,Motley Crue etc. were inspired by AC/DC and specialy &quot;LTRB&quot; also the <BR>New Wave Of British Heavy Metal wouldn't have existed without this album!!!!!
B00003CX9S|5.0|I rented this movie on a recommendation from a David Lynch fan.  He said it wasn't as weird as his other films and is probably the best place to start to slowly ease into what he does.  I rented it then on that recommendation and I must say I didn't expect to get as upset as I did.  It's a very sad film throughout no matter how you look at it.  Whether Merrick is being abused or treating with kindness it's almost hard to hold back tears a lot of the time.  For me the parts that are most moving are when Merrick is treated with kindness unexpectedly and is emotionally moved.  It's really just a very beautiful film I think.  I don't really think this movie is for everyone due to the fact that it is so upsetting and sad, but people that enjoy those kinds of films should love this movie.
0446310786|1.0|This book is the worst book in the world. I read half way through the book and gave up because it made no sence
B000089RVR|4.0|We all loved &quot;Thank You&quot; from dido on her last album. This album boasts of course the title track &quot;Life for rent&quot; and &quot;white flag&quot;. Both are songs that have a good melody and beat. The album focuses more on acutal sound, than music. When dido sings &quot;with&quot; the music. It is definitley a very, very good album, there are just a few tracks that aren't very impressive. Lyrically Dido, is obviously trying to set a theme with this album, what that theme is, is not very clear. It could be her expressed love to an ex- lover. But you have to have your own opinion on that. As I said before, Life For Rent is a good album, but don't expect to be AMAZED when you hear it. It is a very relaxing album that anyone can enjoy.
B000089RVR|2.0|I was so excited to pick up this CD, after hearing her debut No Angel...after listening I left wondering &quot;What Happened?&quot;.<br />I really love Dido's voice, but the material on this album is dreadful - that's right, dreadful!!  I listened to White Flag and thought, ehhh...this is ok...then I realized this was her first single from this album and then thought...Uh Oh.  My fears came true as I listened on.  This disc has no spirit.  Listen closely to her vocals throughout the whole CD - it's nearly monotone.  Sad to say, I really didn't have any favorites on this disc and will probably let it sit in my CD collection, unlistened to, or sell it.<br />I do have one question though, &quot;Dido, did you do this or did Arista records do this?&quot;.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Since 1990 I've been a fan of Cretu's ENIGMA. I have to confess that each release surprises me in a way that only his geniality could do. &quot;Voyageur&quot; is everything a fan would expect from a long journey that started over a decade ago. I see &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror&quot; and &quot;Turn Around&quot; as traces of the metamorphoses process ENIGMA was going through and it was obvious that it would arrive where it is now. Is that why the cover art of &quot;Voyageur&quot; is filled with moth representations? ENIGMA evoluted, but the old elements are still there after all. This is definately one of  ENIGMA's 5 best albums. (could you pick one to be the worst?) Once again I was touched by the beautiful sound, perfect arrangements, powerfull drumbeats, sexy rythims, even distorced voices which I have always been sceptic about are unquestionably used with great mastery in this work. I love the gregorian and ethnic chants but there is no space for them here. &quot;Look of Today&quot;, &quot;Incognito&quot;, &quot;From East to West&quot;, &quot;Boum-Boum&quot;, &quot;Following the Sun&quot; are my favorite. Very modern, far from cheap New Age sound, and completely ENIGMA. Thanks Cretu. I can't wait for the next one!!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Where to begin? How about: This album absolutely ***kin rocks! After over 25 years together, most bands would be running out of steam, yet Maiden has turned out one of their best albums to date, if not their BEST album of all time. Like on their last album, Brave New World, they continue to blend their classic style with a more mature, modern sound. Brave New World, however, was merely a warm up for Dance of Death, which blows it out of the ***kin water.<br />I've heard a couple complaints by people online who don't like Dance of Death because it's very different from Piece of Mind or Powerslave. Well duh, of course it's not! I'd be pretty bored with Maiden by now if all their albums sounded exactly the same. The great thing about Maiden is that they've managed to continuously re-invent themselves without losing their classic sound. So if you're one of those typically American fans who don't like anything by Maiden beyond 1990 (and I can say that because I'm American myself), do us all a favor and don't listen to Dance of Death, so the rest of us don't have to listen to or read your whining. However, to those of you who are true Maiden fans, or who just like good ***kin music, pick up this album as soon as you can.<br />The thing that makes Dance of Death really fantastic, however, is that it's a much more personal album than just about anything they've done in the past. Many of Maiden's previous songs focused on Science Fiction and Dark Fantasy subjects, although some songs had such varied topics as fighter pilots (Aces High), subconscious fears (Still Life, Fear of the Dark), stories about a wide variety of intense characters (Hallowed Be Thy Name, The Trooper, Nomad) and many others. The songs on DoD, however, are all much more immediate and emotional, focusing on everything from self empowerment, to human cloning, to the war in Iraq, to injustice in the criminal justice system. Songs like Blood Brothers, The Thin Line Between Love and Hate, or even Revelations would not be out of place on DoD, whether in terms of sound or subject matter. Even the songs about medieval europe, dancing with demons, and WWI have a more personal feel to them than they might've in the past. In fact, Dance of Death might be one of the most emotionally resonating albums since Bruce Springsteen's The Rising. As drummer Nicko McBrain himself might've said, \\" 'Kin marvelous.\\"<br />1) Wildest Dreams- This song right here is classic Maiden. I've heard that it is, in some ways, evocative of the old Paul Di'anno days from the albums Killers and Iron Maiden. Having never heard either album in great detail, I can't confirm this, but I will say it's one awesome song. Personally I think it harkens back to Die With Your Boots On, both thematically and musically, but its also a distinctive song in its own right. It's a song about self empowerment and living life the way you want, which are very much Maiden themes. As an album opener, Dreams isn't quite as good as The Wickerman (Brave New World) or Aces High (Powerslave), but it's damn close. Rating- 4.5/5<br />2) Rainmaker- Holy ****. Who'd have thought so much emotion could be packed into under 4 minutes. Proof that a song doesn't need to be an epic to be emotionally powerful. A great song with a great melody, awesome guitars (courtesy Dave and Adrian, I think), and incredible lyrics. And of course, \\"The Air Raid Siren\\" Bruce Dickinson himself is in top form as always. My personal favorite track. Rating- 6/5<br />3) No More Lies- The first epic of the album and an introduction to the orchestral sound that is promenant in several tracks on this album. A great slow, moody intro that leads into a real Kick Ass song. Once again Bruce prooves he hasn't lost his touch. His voice here is both wistful and powerful, sometimes by turns, sometimes at once. Definite religious themes to this song, evoking images of reincarnation and The Last Supper. Its theme and tone are similar to Hallowed be Thy Name, and it rocks justas hard. Rating- 5/5<br />4) Montsegur- This one took me a few listenings to get into, but it gets better every time I hear it. Very heavy track, but one expects that sort of thing from Maiden. Great if you prefer that sort of thing. A bit less melodic than the previous tracks, and the melody that is there didn't appeal to me much at first. Once I gave it a few listens though, I really started to get into it. Rating- 4.5/5<br />5) Dance of Death- Another epic song. Once again it starts out slow, but this time Bruce's vocals are low and even menacing at times. Then of course, the song takes off into traditional Maiden style. For the most part, this is an awesome, awesome song, but unfortunately there are a few flaws in this particular diamond. The lyrics are a tad odd at times (should the word \\"pranced\\" really be in an Iron Maiden song?) but the most distracting thing for me came around the three minute mark, which sounds almost identical to a part from Spinal Tap's Stonehenge. It makes it very hard to take the song seriously, no matter how freakin' cool it is otherwise. But as long as all the scenery is the right size when Maiden goes on tour, it shouldn't be a real big problem, right? Rating- 4/5<br />6) Gates of Tomorrow- It just goes to show you how great this album is, that a song like this could get lost in the shuffle. Starts off with a pure Maiden guitar opening, with Steve Harris' magnificent bass underneith. Bruce does harmony with himself on this track, a trick Maiden hasn't tried for a while. Again, he sounds fantastic, especially on the chorus. Another classic sounding Maiden track. Rating- 4.5/5<br />7) New Frontier- The first song writing credit by Nicko McBrain in his 20-some years with the band. Why Nicko never wrote a song before is a mystery to me, considering how much this one rocks, but here's hoping he continues to contribute from now on! Great lyrics, great guitar work, a chorus that's catchy as hell, and a melody that really grows on you after a few listens, New Frontier has all of the above. Hats off to you, Mr. McBrain, you've created a monster. Rating- 5/5<br />8) Paschendale- One of the absolute best epics that Maiden has ever done, and that's coming from a huge fan of Hallowed Be Thy Name, Dream of Mirrors, and No More Lies. The song recalls a fateful battle of World War I in one of the most personal and unflinching tracks Maiden has ever performed. In my mind, this is probably the best song guitarist Adrian Smith has ever written with the band. Both the quiet moments and the heavy are in perfect compliment to each other. An absolute masterpiece of Maiden metal. Rating- 6/5<br />9) Face in the Sand- A power ballad, with emphasis on the \\"power\\" rather than the \\"ballad\\". The song deals with the current war in Iraq and is possibly the most emotional song that Maiden has ever done. I don't know about everyone else, but I remember how I felt during September 11th and again when the war in Iraq started, and the lyrics to Face in the Sand describe those feelings perfectly. It might not be as catchy as Rainmaker or as kick ass as Paschendale, but it's at least as emotional and it's a damn awesome track. Rating- 5/5<br />10) Age of Innocence- If I absolutely have to pick a weakest track for this album, this one is it. Like the track before it, it delves into Maiden's power ballad territory, but much less successfully. Later on, the track tries to get much heavier, but unfortunately just comes off as a very bad Blind Guardian riff. The melody doesn't appeal to me much either, except for the chorus, which is very uplifting and redeems the rest of the song. It's not as bad as Quest for Fire on Piece of Mind, but it doesn't do a lot for me compared with the rest of the album. Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. Rating- 3.5/5<br />11) Journeyman- What's this? Maiden actually doing a slower, softer song? Impossible! And yet here it is, probably the first truly slow song Maiden has ever done, without breaking out into it's trademarked fast-paced guitar rifts. Highly remeniscent of Tears of the Dragon off Bruce Dickinson's solo album Balls to Picasso, although Tears is unquestioningly the better song. Never-the-less, Journeyman is an excellent track, one in which Maiden sheds its trade-marked heaviness, but none of its trademarked power. There's not much actual guitar here; instead, the song focuses on Steve Harris's bass, Nicko McBrain's drums, and Bruce Dickinson's voice. And of course, those fabulous violins we've come to love over the course of the album. Rating- 4/5<br />Overall Album Rating- 5/5
B00006RINF|5.0|Never heard of Lacuna Coil?  Unfortunately, most listeners in the U.S. haven't, either.  Why that is, I can't tell you, because they are easily the most talented rock band around these days.  This 4th release by the Italian band is not better than their previous release &quot;Unleashed Memories,&quot; but it's just as good.  The songs are a bit heavier this time out, but Cristina Scabbia's voice remains beautiful, haunting, ethereal....perfect.  Although this is their latest CD, it was actually the first one I heard and as soon as Cristina's voice came in on the first track (&quot;Swamped&quot;), I was hooked.  And just when I though it couldn't get any better, the second track (&quot;Heaven's a Lie&quot;) kicked in and just blew me completely away.  I challenge you to find a song more worthy of being a hit.  Don't let the fact that Lacuna Coil is (for some inexplicable reason) virtually unknown in the U.S. stop you.  If you like rock music, of any genre, you'll love this CD and you'll love this band.  Take a chance and you'll become a fan.
B000002UR7|5.0|No one reviewed this?! Goodness Gracious.<br />Well, most likely if you listen to Radiohead, you started with the Bends or OK Computer. That's the norm. Even though this sounds nothing like the Radiohead you might know, it is still very much Thom Yorke and the crew. This album is very average of the british rock scene, but still has it's unique points, like of course, Thom Yorkes voice. Lyrical obscurity isn't really an issue on this album as it might be with future releases, but all in all, it's a great album.
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad, in truth, really doesn't &quot;teach&quot; much of anything. A lot of the lessons Robert Kiyosaki offers you've probably already heard somewhere else. Things like &quot;make your money work for you,&quot; &quot;pay yourself first,&quot; etc.<br />What can exactly does that mean though?<br />Simply put, Kiyosaki offers a simple new way to look at money. It's more important for most people to unplug their current thinking of money. Instead of thinking, &quot;I'll never be rich,&quot; and then turn on something stupid like &quot;Friends,&quot; and then wonder why they don't have money, a financially smart person will learn more about money. Learn how to manage and control your money. <br />Still, I find a few things a little worrisome. It's clear that Kiyosaki believes real estate is the best solution to wealth-building, and it can be, but first learn what you're doing. Also, I find the philosophy of &quot;greed is good,&quot; and &quot;paying yourself,&quot; even when other obiligations are more pressing, is a dangerous system. Greed is more often than not a destructive force.
B00005B36H|5.0|2 years and I still listen to this album all the time, Tool really went out of their normal style for this album and made an extremely diverse, tribal, psychadelic, math-metal album. Every song on the album is completely different yet the album flows together very well. Because of Tool's originality this, like all their work, takes much more than 1 listen to fully understand and appreciate. Don't judge on whether or not you want to buy lateralus based on the little 15 second samples here on amazon, tool is not a band you can simply listen to for 15 seconds and judge. Lateralus will grow on you with each listen, especially the more experimental songs on the album such as disposition and reflection. I can't recommend lateralus enough, especially for fans of Pink Floyd or any other progressive rock band. tool is the only band i know today that is capable of making original and complex songs but at the same time appealing to the mainstream audience. So go out and buy this, your collection needs it. enjoy.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|As a former addict/drug abuser this is it. The most realistic depiction of addiction I've ever seen on film. Never want to see it again. It was a flashback to the horror, the black creeping death, the living breathing nightmare I never EVER EVER EVER want to experience again. It IS Hell. A shocking and nauseating reminder, and I truly cannot thank the director of this film enough for that. He's done us all a real service by making this movie, trust me. If you've got a friend toying with the idea of playing with needles or whatever other strange addictive object, tie them up, put tape on their lids to keep their eyes open, and <BR>MAKE THEM WATCH THIS FILM.
B000002I99|5.0|I don't mean that every song on the album is over the top. What I mean is that they just don't make albums like this anymore(whether you like the songs or not). With the disbandment of the \\"Alice Cooper Group\\" Alice was able to take thing in his own hands. He co-writes every song, with the help of Dick Wagner and Bob Ezrin among others and created some timeless classics.<BR> Everybody has heard or heard of \\"Only Women Bleed\\" which was Alice's first balled and unlike anything he had ever done before. Alice would have better balleds in the future, but not with more powerful lyrics.<BR>\\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" A mixture of rock and jazz. A good track to start an album that takes you on a journey such as this one .<BR>\\"Department of Youth\\" Very similar to his other teen anthems. A bit different from the rest of the album. The guitar brakes are cool. The ending lines are neat too.<BR>The following are some other gems that are not as praised as they should be.<BR>\\"Some Folks\\" If someone can explain this song I whould be grateful, although not knowing makes more interesting.<BR>\\"Steven\\" Alice shows off his vocal range on this one. Quite a creepy song. It's not the lyrics really but the piano that makes it like that. The music at the end is outstanding.<BR>As stated earlier thay just don't make albums like this anymore. Not there is not good music out there, it's just not the like this.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|I was a kid when The Breakfast Club was made in 1985 and from that point on it has been one of my favorite movies. This was the first time I saw Judd Nelson and got an instant crush on him. I know every line that Judd Nelson's character utters and each line said became a cult classic. It was hits like this that made the brat pack the best set of young actors ever. The Breakfast Club never gets stale! It's only one of a few movies you can watch over and over and end up loving it even more each time!  Ally Sheedy was a bit wasted. She didn't say but ten words in the movie but still being the &quot; basketcase &quot; was the most recognizable role in her career. Molly Ringwald was the Teen Queen back then and carried her role with perfection. She played the pampered princess so well it makes anyone want to punch her out for being so snotty. Anthony Michael Hall was once again the geek who made Sixteen Candles a bonafide hit. Last but not least, Emilio Estevez rounded the cast.  Straight fun, non-stop laughter.  Especially if you're into sarcasm and people who have nothing in common falling in love. The Breakfast Club is a movie all 80's kids should own.<br />Classic Judd Nelson ( John Bender ) lines:<br />Bender to Andy: You didn't hear that? You want me to turn it up?<br />Bender to Brian: You're a neo-maxi zoom deebie.  What would you be doing if you weren't out making yourself a better citizen?<br />You gotta love this movie and Judd Nelson rocks!

B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two Towers is one of the best fantasy movies of all time. It has everything you could ask for in a movie. Action, adventure, romance, fantastic scenery, great directing, acting, and a fantastic story adapted from one of the most loved novels of all time. It continues The Fellowship of the Ring ending perfectly as if it's just continuing one big movie. And the ending of The Two Towers keeps you grinding your teeth for next installment. Fantastic battles in the movie are some of the best battles I've ever seen and the intimate story is one that really touches hearts. The story of from going from a good quiet life in the country to saving the world in strange and dangerous lands has never been told better than the Lord of the Rings series and when you watch it you truly feel like you've gone a long way from home and are feeling the pain thats being endured by the characters. If you think twice about buying this, you're crazy, because there is no movie even similar to this fantastic piece of art and there will never be anything like it:)
0385507755|5.0|One of the first reactions I had after finishing this remarkable book was a deep desire to meet the author and shake his hand (or give him a hug if he would allow it).  I cannot remember having been as deeply affected (or disturbed) by a book in a long time.  Quite simply this is the story of a person completely addicted to multiple substances, and how, after he lands in a rehabilitation program, he fights for his life against unrelenting and daunting odds.  I have to honestly say that I have never experienced substance abuse, but I have a daughter who fell into that black hole for several years.  I watched her disintigrate both physically and emotionally.  She reached a point where she recognized that she was either going to climb out of her hole, or destroy herself completely.  She chose the former, and is now healthy and sober.  Reading this book gave me some insight (I am convinced that no one can really understand the draw of addiction without having been addicted themselves) into what makes an addict an addict.  I have reconsidered much of my thinking (such as &quot;if they really wanted to get off of drugs or alcohol they could&quot; and &quot;they are simply paying the consequences of their own poor decisions&quot;) I found this book so painful at times that I had to put it down, and read it in small doses.  Nothing is spared in this book.  Mr. Frey's brutal honesty will shock and quite possibly offend many readers. I cannot imagine how painful this was for him to write - to recall all the pain and horror of his life and then spill it all out on the pages of a book.  I do know that I am grateful to him for doing so.  And one cannot help but admire him for taking his own path, not necessarily the traditional ones offered in rehabilitation centers.  My daughter did the same - she made a decision to stop the madness on her own, and became sober totally on her own, with no outside help, and she has stayed clean and sober for 3 years, with no desire to return todrugs and alcohol.  This book should be read by everyone, certainly by anyone who knows or loves an addicted person.  This book helps show that given enough strength of character and a strong support system of friends and/or family, a person can learn to rise above their demons and reclaim their lives.  Thank you, Mr. Frey, for opening my eyes and mind, and for the pain you endured to share this remarkable story with us.
0385504209|5.0|This is the first book I've ever read by Dan Brown and I'm happy to say that it won't be the last.  I started reading this book and couldn't put it down.  Very few books can have that effect on me.  Immediately after reading The Da Vinci Code I went out and purchased Angels &amp; Demons and Deception Point, also by Dan Brown.  I can't wait to finish these two books.  And Dan, come on finish your next book already :-).

0140131558|3.0|The book tries to be too smart while it isn't. It wants to become a sophisticated literature game but it fails. I liked other Auster's books (Music of Chance,Vertigo, The Book of Illusions) but you just can't love that book because you understand it only partly and you can't like the characters.
B00000ILDE|5.0|This movie was excellent.The best out of the trilogy.The portrayal of the Colonial Space Marines was by far the most realistic depiction of &quot;grunts&quot; I've ever seen,and was right on the money.It reminded me of my time in the service even though this was Sci-fi.I've read that a Director's Cut is in the works and will show the cocooning of Apone &amp; Deitrich.We shall see.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This is one of those rare intelligent, artistic movies that manages to deliver both entertainment and impact.<br />Magnolia isn't a story about just one person; it's not about a few characters, either. With its large, magnificient cast, it spins a story of many people, both as individuals and as members of the society they belong in. There are so many threads in the movie, you'd almost expect it to disintegrate in some sections, but somehow it all holds together to form a beautiful mozaic. <br />After I watched it, I couldn't help but keep thinking about the people in my life, those whom I know well and those I don't, and about how much I really know about them and what it's like to be living as them. <br />It's profound, entertaining, provoking and produced with zeal and talent. A great reflection of what life really is like. If you prefer traditional Hollywood movies, Magnolia isn't a good choice for you, but if you like movies that make you think and feel, Magnolia's a good choice for a buy.
B000075BFK|5.0|He's been dead since 96!  how's he keep doin it?  Once again the late great Tupac Shakur has shown rap fans what REAL rap music is.  Not Nelly, not DMX, not Puffy....TUPAC!!!! This CD is a masterpiece from the first to the last song.  i've had this CD for many a month, and right as we speak it is in my CD player.  This CD isnt your normal rap CD, its not all bi#hes n hoes.  there are some seriously deep songs on this CD.  You can feel his pain on &quot;My Block&quot;, which looks back into his past surrounding his upbringing in the slums.  This is just one of the amazing songs.  BUY THIS CD!!!!!  your an IDIOT if you dont
0800141806|5.0|Philadelphia deals with a big, big tacky theme. It's about homosexuality, homophobia, AIDS, justice and death. Before that scares you off, though, it's handled in such a manner that even those with the most delicate senses won't be offended. <br />Philadelphia chooses to forgive instead of judge (Which is ironical, since it's basically a court-room drama.) It chooses to include instead of exclude, and the theme of tolerance works without being sappy. I'm not a homophobe but I'm not a liberal, either. Still, with the exceptional screen writing and extraordinary acting by Hanks and Washington, I could see from homosexuals' viewpoints without judging or disliking them in the least. I have to say this movie changed my perception quite a bit. <br />Oh, and that scene with Tom Hanks and the opera... I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. I was so completely caught up in this character, I felt a pain in my heart like a twisting knife. If you've ever lost someone you love prematurely, you'll know what I mean. <br />Every aspect of the movie worked just fine. Especially the delicate juggling between the accepted homophobic viewpoint of the times, and the struggle gays and lesbians have to make to simply live and love. <br />Emotional catharsis, impact, entertainment, whatever you're aiming for, I can promise you that Philadelphia won't fail.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This Cd is the perfect blend of all the greatest Hendrix tunes!<BR>Its off the hook!
B00003CXRP|2.0|I've watched almost every movie that Tom Hanks has starred in, I think he's that great. But... Why did he ever choose to appear in this God-forsaken movie about a God-forsaken deserted island? And all that dieting he did... He could have spent that much effort in a whole lot better in a better movie. <br />It's a stupid Robinson Crusoe movie with a stupid plot. Hanks salvages the movie and makes it watchable with his exceptional talent, but not much more. <br />Tom, why don't you switch your agent?
B0000AFQS0|5.0|In their glory days no band delivered a more explosive live show than the Who, and the members of the band have always felt that their studio albums never quite captured that astonishing energy.  Well, this re-mastered version of this classic rock movie captures it just fine.  The producers of this re-release did a lot of work finding old film and tape and making it all look and sound better than ever before, they deserve our thanks for putting so much effort into this.  The results make the Who jump right through your TV-audio system.  I've seen much of this footage before on other releases, it has never looked as sharp and rich, or sounded so powerful, they really did a fantastic job.  The special edition is worth a few bucks extra as it comes with a second DVD with extra features.  Hardcore Who fans have their little gripes, even more rare footage would have been nice etc., but the complaints pale beside the quality of this release, which shows just how good these old rock films can be made if somebody puts enough effort into them.  It's an erratic film, it jumps all over, sort of like the band, but it's a time capsule of one of rock's mightiest acts at their best.  Well done, highly recommended.
B00004U2G4|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums ever.  I stole if from my dad a few years back just to hear some good guitar work, and it has not been out of the cd player.  It is not quite Led Zepplin, but it is great.  Some of the best gutair and singing (Rod Stwert at his best) there is.  All the songs are great.  Just put it in and listen from begin to end.  Note: have it loud.
B0000B3FCX|4.0|Another great hit from Nickleback and the only thing wrong with this album is that it is somewhat repetive on each song, but still a great album. Recommend getting it along with Fuel's Natural Selection CD.

The dinosaurs destroy all the hunters' life- saving equipment which leads to massive loss of life.<BR>Later our &quot;heroes&quot;, who have an opportunity to drug and thus stop the T-Rex from crushing people in San Diego lead the T-Rex on a dangerous street chase so that they can save the T-Rex's life.<BR>Lots of characters died in order to save animals in this movie. Personally, this movie offended me because I think human life is sacred.

Slash got all stoned and said &quot;Dudes, we should like, totally do a cover album.&quot;  Axl was too busy beatin' his girlfriend at the time, so he unwillingly agreed.  Their decent tunes, but there is no possible way to follow up on AFD, and sad to say, this album could have lead to the demise of the group.
0425170349|5.0|Rainbow Six, Tom Clancy's 10th novel and ninth in the Jack Ryan/John Clark series, once more focuses on the ex-CIA paramilitary field officer known in the Agency as Mr. Clark. This time, the focus once again turns to the challenges of fighting global terrorists and the menace from extremists determined not only to reshape society, but the entire planet's environment.<br />Clark is close to retiring as a paramilitary officer in the Central Intelligence Agency's Directorate of Operations when Agency executive directors Ed and Mary Pat Foley, with the tacit approval of the recently elected President John Patrick Ryan, ask him to run an elite team of antiterrorist Special Ops fighters from several NATO countries.  Their mission: to act as an international 911 team in hostage and other terror-related situations deemed too high-risk for local law-enforcement agencies. Based in England, this so-called Rainbow Team will be deployed mainly in Europe, but with support from U.S. and other allied nations, can operate anywhere in the world.  Clark, who was an enlisted member of a SEAL team in Vietnam, is given a rank equivalent to a full colonel and the call sign Rainbow Six. (In military parlance, the designator \\"six\\" after a unit's call sign is assigned to a commanding officer.)<br />Rainbow Six opens with a tense incident high above the Atlantic as a small group of Basque terrorists attempts to hijack the plane carrying Clark, his wife, his protege and new son-in-law Domingo \\"Ding\\" Chavez, and Alistair Stanley, his British second in command, to London.  Using their wits and finely honed skills, the three Rainbow members overwhelm the hijackers and save the crew and their fellow passengers.<br />With this introduction to the job, Clark then turns his attention to training the various members of the several Rainbow teams, not knowing that the airliner incident was simply one of many terrorist incidents being bankrolled by a mysterious and wealthy individual with a darker, more terrifying agenda.  With the assistance of a former KGB officer and inspired by one of the most horrible aspects of the Iranian plot against the U.S. (as chronicled in Executive Orders), a group of environmental extremists is plotting to reverse centuries of man-made damage to the Earth's biosphere by committing the most horrible act of mass murder in history.<br />Clancy's novel paints a troubling picture of what happens when a noble idea (such as promoting global conservation) is twisted and perverted by charismatic and cold-blooded individuals, and its action-oriented plot inspired an ongoing series of computer games.terrifying agenda.

B00004RIV4|5.0|Moloko have definetely proved themselves as true artists from their debut &quot;Do You Like My Tight Sweater?&quot;. Followed by the (in my opinion) mediocre &quot;I Am Not A Doctor&quot;. Moloko's third effort passes the first two albums in quality. &quot;Things to Make and Do&quot; is also better than Moloko's fourth album &quot;Statues&quot;. Moloko is such a versatile and refreshing band that anything they put out will be excellent. <br />THINGS TO MAKE AND DO<br />1) Radio Moscow - A little piano-based 25 second intro. ^5/5^<br />2) Pure Pleasure Seeker - *SECOND SINGLE* - A fun, funky song with cathy lines. Great song to make you dance. ^5/5^<br />3) Absent Minded Friends - A darker sounding song. Rosin's vocals are strong in this one. ^3/5^<br />4) Indigo - *THIRD SINGLE* - One of my favorites on the album. The video for this one is great. This song has fun lyrics that are great to sing along to. This one's pretty funky. ^5/5^<br />5) Being is Bewildering - One of the slower-paced songs on the album. I love Rosin's voice twoards the end where she croons &quot;just being is bewildering&quot;. ^4/5^<br />6) Remain the Same - This one sounds a little similar to &quot;Absent Minded Friends&quot; until the chorus rolls around where Rosin sings rather loudly &quot;CHANGE MY NAME I REMAIN THE SAME&quot;. ^3.5/5^<br />7) Drop in the Ocean - A calm slow song that lasts about 1 minute 58 seconds. I like this one because it's one of the good chill-out tracks on the album. ^5/5^<br />8) Dumb Inc. - A fun song with fun lyrics. (i.e. &quot;Dumb Dumb / So sweet so young / You're not suppossed to swallow your bubble gum&quot; and &quot;You and me are free to be the dumbest in town&quot;) ^5/5^<br />9) The Time is Now - *FIRST SINGLE* - An awesome song with a folky-sort of mood. Great lyrics. ^5/5^<br />10) Mother - A jazzy song to Rosin's mother, although the lyrics may not be very flattering. ^5/5^<br />11) It's Your Problem - A funny minute long interlude with just tons oflittle elctronic bleeps and flurps. ^5/5^<br />12) It's Nothing - Frankly, this one is kinda slow and boring. ^2.5/5^<br />13) Bingo Massacre - A 23 second interlude with nice music. I think the music for this one could have been turned into a song. ^4/5^<br />14) Somebody Somewhere - A nice upbeat tune similar to &quot;Pure Pleasure Seeker&quot;; just not as good. ^3.5/5^<br />15) Just You and Me Dancing - This interlude starts off with Rosin screaming. This one is kinda fun to listen to even though its only about a minute and a half long. ^5/5^<br />16) If You Have A Cross To Bear You May As Well Use It As A Crutch - A weird song that is mostly instrumental with occasional saying: &quot;If you have a cross to bear I think it's fair that you use it as a cruth&quot; in this weird psychotic voice. This is a good song to rock out to though. ^4/5^<br />17) Keep Stepping - A pointless 19 second interlude to barely any music where we here something like &quot;Hands in the air...I wanna see you moving...keep stepping...&quot; ^2.5/5^<br />18) Sing It Back (Boris Musical Mix) - A nice remix of &quot;Sing It Back&quot;. A bit long though because a lot of the song is just music. ^3.5/5^<br />Overall, this album is Moloko's best. I give Moloko 5 star in creativity, effort, and overall quality. I love this disc and HIGHLY recommend if you want something refreshing and intersting.

B0000028TN|5.0|I bought this record in my hometown of Copenhagen when I was about 12 or 13 years of age.  Ever since then, it's had a special place in my heart, an I never get tired of listening to it. I'm glad to see that it's been rediscovered as a classic, (eps. after years of friends telling me it was a cheezy record -- before jazz, funk, and latin became mainstream in the clubs again  ;) <br />The keyboard solos on this record are mind blowingly melodic, and some of the meanest funkyist trombone you'll ever hear is on this record. But the bass playing tops it all. If you are a bass player, this record is a must; a brilliant example of how to be funky, melodic, and totally unique and innovative with every note played. Funkier than anyone who ever thumbed or slapped a bass string. (I believe it's Byron Miller...?)

0792838068|5.0|This is one of the rare occasions where I think this movie was actually better than the book. Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue bring a depth and vulnerability to their film characters that the more detached characters in the book seemed to lack. The result is a heartbreaking story about two people who, while hitting rock bottom, find true love. Ben, a suicidal alcoholic, and Sera, a prostitute, are the kind of people that the rest of the world likes to sweep under the rug. So since neither character has any pretense, any ego, or anything really to lose, they are able to come together and love each other in a sincere and unconditional way. The result is that the film, although incredibly sad, is also strangely inspiring.
B00005JLKB|2.0|I am a fan of Superman, always have been. I havent even lost hope that Lois &amp; Clark DVDs will be made<br />Now to Smallville... Great show<BR>DVDs? they are not 5.1, they are only stereo<BR>I cant believe they didnt take the time to do the proper sound for the DVDs being that the quality (except for the opening credits) is a great WS anamorphic format.<br />R2 dvds will be 5.1. Now is that fair?
B00000634L|5.0|To anyone who is secpicital about buying this album dont be so. I wasnt sure that i was going to spend $20 on this cd but i was wrong. It never leaves my cd player, its a mix of all types of music. If you can only buy 1 CD ever buy this one!!!!
0446530891|5.0|David Baldacci's new book is absolutely stunning.  It's one of those books that you can't figure out until the end -- because you're turning pages too fast to attempt to figure it out!  His characters are real, his prose breathtaking, and his plot entertaining.  This is a must-read for political scandal buffs! READ BALDACCI'S LATEST!
B00005JLZN|2.0|This would have been a boring propaganda film except for some frenzied camera work and many clues and events designed SOLELY to keep you from turning off the propaganda. In fact, the whole plot line with the \\"journalist racing against time to find out the truth\\" is nothing more than a red herring to keep you watching. Surprisingly, the putative \\"real\\" theme (propaganda against the death penalty), is ALSO a red herring. Therefore, most people will feel cheated after being deceived by this movie.<br />The real theme that permeates every minute of this movie is that there are two types of people in this world, and the death penalty is merely a litmus test to distinguish them. People who oppose the death penalty are intelligent, educated, and caring people who know how to have fun, and those who disagree (Republicans) are stupid mean racists. Examples of the people the movie targets are Texans, George Bush, people with southern accents, and even people who wear cowboy hats and drive pickup trucks. Therefore, many people will be insulted by this movie.<br />If you want to see this film because it opposes the death penalty, you may still feel cheated and insulted because it contains nothing you will find new, thought provoking, or an example of how to be persuasive. However, the movie IS persuasive. It is masterful in its consistent but subtle demonization of Republicans, Southerners, etc.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|One of the most talented to come out of the 70's Bowie is<br />on a roll these days and with his lastest \\"REALITY\\" he continues<br />to put out some very interesting music. I really loved \\"HEATHEN\\"<br />last year and couldn't imagin he could top that. He's just giving us<br />a revolving tour of his many past sides with a modern spin to it. Not that Bowie repeats himself, its hard to re-invent yourself (no one has done this like David, besides Madonna) after all these years, but he is putting out this noncommerial(reminds me a bid of SCAREY MONSTERS/HERO era) but its vidal sound that with repeated listens gets under your skin. I<br />can't wait to get a chance to see this guy LIVE. There is nothing wrong with getting older(Our culture says only youth can entertain, everything is about staying younger,younger at whatever the cost?? Not with Bowie, his music just keeps getting<br />better.I just saw him Live this December 16, 03 and his music and stage presence blew Mohegan Suns arena apart, he's only gotten better with age!  Reality is Artier than HEATHEN, alittle louder in places but full<br />of surprises (I love the song \\"DAYS\\" with its acoutic underplay, gorgeous retro vibe, love this stuff we've all come to expect from Bowie over the years.  David hasn't sounded this fresh since the late 70's-early 80's.  Its to bad radio is not playing him, it certainly would give some perspective to the sameness we are force fed all over the radio dial. Another highlight to the 2003 year.
B0000AK7AA|4.0|This is an excellent movie. I am assuming you have seen it so I won't bore you with a review of the movie itself, wich I give 5 stars. But this DVD release is by no means a &quot;special edition&quot;, a term that is used loosely today to sell more DVD's. That is why I deducted a star. There is a half hour making of wich is interesting, but I wish they would have done more. There is only one deleted scene, and although it is unique and interesting due to the fact that the ghosts were never digitally added, they could have shown more. Then there are little kids games and a classic Casper cartoon. They could have put more of the cartoons on. As far as the actual movie goes, the picture is crisp and the 5.1 mix is decent. I bet next year we will all be fooled when Universal re-releases it for it's 10th anniversary with the real special edition.
B000069AUI|5.0|I love this CD, each song is each a work of art. This CD has meaning and depth to the lyrics. Coldplay is such a great band, I love them.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble's voice and David Foster's inspired production.  This CD is absolutely exquisite.  I am a huge Sinatra fan and Michael does not foolishly try to imitate him.  He infuses every song with his own phrasing and sensuous voice.  David Foster is a master at picking the perfect orchestrations.<br />I never cared for \\"You're Gonna Miss My Loving\\" but after 3 good listens, my eyes teared up and the lyrics took on an entire new meaning - that of sorrow.  Lou Rawl's version is more 'I told you so' bold.  Michael sings it with a broken heart.<br />My favorites?  Moondance of course and Kissing a Fool were unexpected surprises.  I skip the Bee Gees song.  It does nothing for me - but then neither did the original.<br />****   See below for an Update on Feb 10, 2004   ****<BR>I saw Michael live at the Hollywood Bowl on a perfect LA summer evening.  Outside, tank top, shorts, flip-flips, Pinot Grigio, a full moon, and then fireworks.  He didn't get a long enough set but I can't wait to see him again.  His voice sounds even fuller and richer live.  No, it wasn't the wine!<br />Everyone who has heard this CD on my BOSE enjoys it.  Most men love \\"Fever\\"...that cracks me up!<br />Michael Buble' belongs in your collection along with Sting, Sinatra, Linda Ronstandt, Brian Setzer, Bono/U2, Diana Krall, and kd Lang singing Skylark (check it out, gorgeous).<br />I am looking forward to Michael and David collaborating again.  This could be the next Sinatra/Riddle/May team.<br />Enjoy!<BR>Marilyn<br />...
B00000DGUG|5.0|It's a shame that often, the best albums go unnoticed, or, in the case of Alanis Morissette's second international release, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, down played. Critics gave it poor reviews, and fans were initially disgusted (although years later the album is being appreciated). Most fans and non-fans alike expected her to come up with a sequel to her uber-famous debut, Jagged Little Pill. Good as that album was, it is nothing compared to the masterpiece that is Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. Alanis abandoned the generic pop-rock sound (crashing guitars, wailing vocals, and radio-friendly melodies) for a more alternative record, with a wider range of instruments and deeper, more introspective lyrics. I can see why it did not do well commercially, for there are not many songs that scream 'single'. But this makes me appreciate it even more.<br />While Jagged Little Pill's lyrics were repetative, dealing with either angst (&quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, &quot;Right Through You&quot;, &quot;Not The Doctor&quot;), love (&quot;All I Really Want&quot;, &quot;Head Over Feet&quot;), or just plain life in general (&quot;Hand In My Pocket&quot;, &quot;You Learn&quot;, &quot;Ironic&quot;), Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie encounters domestic abuse (&quot;Sympathetic Character&quot;), suicide (&quot;Joining You&quot;), mock spirituality (&quot;Baba&quot;), a desire for respect (&quot;Would Not Come&quot;), and even pays a tribute of sorts to her parents (her father in &quot;The Couch&quot; and her mother in &quot;Heart Of The House&quot;). The interesting subject matter makes the album all-together more enjoyable. <br />Another one of Jagged Little Pill's flaws was how the songs sounded a little similar at times. There is no such thing here. From the crunching guitars of &quot;Baba&quot;, to the scratchy beat of &quot;One&quot;, every song sounds different. <br />Okay, maybe I'm comparing the two albums too much. So here I go into a song-by-song analysis.<br />Front Row - Not the most accessable tune on the record, but it shines. The complexity of the chorus gives you something new every listen. One of the strongest on the album.<br />Baba - Probably my favorite track, Baba starts out with a strange guitar intro, and eventually turns into an out-right headbanger. Musically well done and very well delivered vocally.<br />Thank U - The first and biggest single off the album. It's a slow ballad which is insanely catchy.<br />Are You Still Mad - After 3 great songs, Alanis dips a little with this largely acoustic ballad, which unfortunately falls flat.<br />Sympathetic Character - A more angry song, the verses are awkward yet Alanis finds a way to make them melodic. Good song.<br />That I Would Be Good - An excellent track. Musically capitivating and very sad.<br />The Couch - The first of a few songs on here with no hook, no chorus, no verses, no bridge. It's just a stream of lyrics. It's a fan favorite, but I don't find it particularly compelling. Haunting, however.<br />Can't Not - An intense mid-tempo track which is once again haunting and original.<br />U R - One of the softer, more uplifting songs, it's decent at best.<br />I Was Hoping - A scary intro leads to the weakest song on the record.<br />One - Emotional, and once again extremely original. Strong track.<br />Would Not Come - Almost sounds &quot;dangerous&quot;. After the amazingly addictive chorus comes a brilliant guitar solo which makes me humm along every time.<br />Unsent - Second single in the United States. Like The Couch, it has no chorus. It's basically Alanis reading out five letters to former lovers in a melodic way. Sound boring? Well it's not. Great song.<br />So Pure - The 'guilty pleasure' of the album, Alanis tries a dance-rock track here. The verses are clunky and awkward, but the chorus is catchy. It's short and sweet.<br />Joining You - One of my favorites, it starts out with a heavy guitar riff. The chorus is uplifting yet depressing. Excellent track, and also the second single outside the US, where it was never released (sadly).<br />Heart Of The House - A relatively boring acoustic ballad.<br />Your Congratulations - Is it just me, or does Alanis sound weird at the end? She wails strangely, and can't quite pull it off...<br />11 of the 17 tracks are fantastic; the other 6 fall short of the mark by a long way. But that's just my opinion, and the artistic growth featured throughout the album makes me respect those songs anyways.<br />One of the best albums ever, without a doubt. Morissette's third studio album, Under Rug Swept, is also excellent, and marks a return to a more accessable, melodic sound, while avoiding the cliches that plagued Jagged Little Pill. Almost as good as this album.<br />Do yourself a favor, and don't pay attention to the unfavorable reviews. Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is amazing.
0375823360|5.0|These books will be burned into my mind for many years to come. When a friend of mine first recomended the book to me it sounded like a great pleasure read, but after i finished the first one i was adicted. the story leaves you guessing what in the worlds (indide book joke if you have read it) will happen next. i would HIGHLY! recomend this book to anyone. i reead the first one last year as a Freshman in high school and just finished the last one as a sophomore. this book would be great for teens, but it is not a kiddy book. adults will love it too. I hope the author writes a 4th book but i'm not holding my breath. but if you read this Phillip you should no how many lives you would make happy with a 4th book to wrap everything up or to start a new adventure betwwen Will and Lyra if the worlds are able to.
B00003CXXP|2.0|One comes away from this film with the impression that it is trying to say too much, too obviously but not very effectively.  By trying to mix Kubrick's more brooding style with Spielberg's E.T. sweetness, we end up with a film trying to balance an incongruous world that is dark and foreboding a la \\"Bladerunner\\" where unlicensed AIs can be hunted and killed for amusement yet inhabited by a supporting cast of overbearingly kind to the point of condescension characters.<br />Ultimately this is a story that tries to tell us what it is to be human by having the viewer follow the journey of an artificial boy trying to become one and empathize with him along the way.   This theme has been done multiple times (from Bicentennial Man to perhaps 30 episodes devoted to Data on the Star Trek Series.)   In that respect, AI provides us with very unconvincing signposts and great difficulty in empathizing.  One theme of humanity is of course the ability to feel love, yet not once in this movie do we see indications that the boy David can develop love or even affection on his own for anyone or anything beyond his initial programming to specifically love one person (certainly none for Joe, his robot guide and mentor, or his human family Dad, for example).  His increased obsession with that one target makes him appear, if anything, more robotic, like a computer suffering a self-reinforcing feedback loop in programming. That the much, much lower-tech toy bear, seems to be able to develop new attachment and the converse emotion - dislike - for someone on its own, and that Joe's emotion can evolve while David's does not as he almost ruthlessly pursues one goal, leaves one with a rather odd feeling and not much empathy for the lead character.<br />Fear of extinction is also a sign of life, which is true, as all living things from amoebas, let alone humans, have a desire for self-preservation.  In case we miss this, the movie gives us a melodramatic scene where a member of the cast actually gets up and says so - loudly.   Yet prior to this, we have already witnessed that all robots have a desire for self-preservation, Joe by fleeing a crime-scene, and even the Model-T Ford of robots scrounge for scrap parts and try to evade capture to prolong their right to exist even for one more minute if they could.  So we are left wondering what is so special and cutting-edge about David verbalizing his desire to live.  This is made worse when the script calls for Joe to show signs of gratitude and relief at the reprieve while the supposedly `nearer to human' David, despite the rhetoric, does not. <br />Goal seek then is to be interpreted by us, as later pointed out by William Hurt in the movie, as a sign of `humanity'.  Yet goal seek programming that can adjust and modify itself to outside factors are within the capability of the science of today and nothing at all to get excited about in a life/non-life context.  That another robot actually shows a willingness to possibly give up his own goal of freedom and self-existence for another's goal while David singularly is unable to do so, makes us feel that the other robot is more `human' and David is upstaged again.<br />Even at the very flawed-ending, where through deed, speech, tone of voice and accompanying music we are bludgeoned over the head without any subtlety whatsoever in an attempt to force us to see how `feeling' AIs can eventually be, David shows no gratitude, co-operation, reciprocation or compromise he just wants what he wants - a very robotic response.  This is not a reflection of Osment's performance, it is the script.  If the movie's intent was to deliver the message that selfishness is the primary initial characteristic of humanity and is trying to convey this moral judgment, then it succeeded.  If that was not what we are supposed to interpret, then it failed.<br />Had the movie ended 20 minutes earlier shall we say (without giving away the plot), upon arrival at a certain underwater location, this might have been a 3 star movie that left us mildly unsettled with food for thought afterwards.  As it is, fine cinematography, visual effects and another sterling performance by Jude Laws earns it 2 stars
B000069AUI|5.0|Words cannot express the need for this CD.  This is real music.
B00005QDW1|1.0|Decent angling is something every customer has a right to expect. As James M. McPherson writes in Crossroads of Freedom, &quot;The detritus of battle lay thickly on the field: smashed weapons and gun carriages, dead horses, scraps of bloody clothing, discarded knapsacks and blanket rolls, and the smell of rotting corpses, vomit, and excrement.&quot; This was his most revolutionary statement. If you close your eyes and make an allegation, someday it might come true...that is, of course, when they wear a little tie clip we're meant to take as a kind of emotional chastity belt. Otherwise, it's only the third attempt to disturb our sleep.<br />Which is why I consider this album a masterpiece of thanatopsis. No stars are good enough for it.
B0000508U6|5.0|Wow.  A real music group, in our lifetime.  Sop it up, enjoy...
B000066NW0|1.0|So how come the suits at corporate headquarters picked this person to be its latest mass-marketed product? I don't get it. She doesn't really write her own songs (check the album credits: there's always two or three other names next to each song). She can't sing or play an instrument (check out her live performances and see for yourself). And she's not particularly good-looking. So what's the deal? Is her Dad a music-industry producer or something?
B00000HZFH|5.0|These other reviewers are right that it's amazing BTS has written two of the best albums ever. I might even say they've written three of them and put Ultimate Alternative Wavers on the short list, but probably not. Anyway, I like this slightly more than Perfect From Now On, mostly because of Carry the Zero. This is definitely my favorite BTS song, and one of the greatest songs ever. The rest of the album is nearly just as good, and virtually all flawless. The other highlights are the intro to Time Trap, although I wish the song itself was longer (I think it could have been the definitive BTS epic song, and it ends right when it sounds like it should be getting started), all of Temporarily Blind, and ALL of the rest of the CD.
B00005KB9W|5.0|I consider this to be one of Bob marley's best cds.The cd starts off with the incredibly moving trenchtown rock.Then you have an excellent rendition of Burnin and Lootin. Them belly full is an incredibly energetic song. Next,is a totally groovin' lively up yourself. no woman no cry is a slow song but has to be considered one of marleys best and this is by far the best version of it.I shot the sheriff and Get up stand up would be without a doubt their best editions also if Peter Tosh was with him.Then you have a fun and fast kinky reggae. this cd shows how much marley loved making this music. I would reccomend this cd to anyone because it is definetly not just for hardcore marley fans like myself.
B000002N2Z|5.0|I'm not a fan of whatever style of music this is; most people say the Deftones and Korn are the influencers and everyone else has ripped them off. I don't know anything about that, but I've been able to stand Korn, and I don't really care for any of the other Deftones albums. For some reason, though, I love Adrenaline. All of the songs are fantastic, and I can just hear the energy they put into it. It's amazing. The best songs on here are Bored, Minus Blindfold (especially after the second false ending), Nosebleed, 7 Words, Engine Number 9, and the untitled hidden track. I think the hidden track is one of the best &quot;emo&quot; songs ever written, but these emo kids won't admit it because it's the deftones. It's sad. Anyway, this is great album, and the only one by the band I'd recommend.
0780628551|1.0|This movie should be 10min long because that's how long it takes to tell the story. Husband goes to space, alien takes over his body, alien gets wife pregnant, woman fights alien husband. The end. I can't tell you how many boring and pointless scenes there are in this movie that have nothing to do with story or character development. After the woman finds out she's pregnant she goes to talk with other pregnant women who are talking about getting their feet rubbed. Charlize Theron is horrible in this movie. She has no personality and doesn't show any acting ability until the last 5min of the film. She walks around completely bored throughout the entire movie. You learn that her character &quot;sees dead people&quot; which has nothing to do with the story. Johnny Depp is a great actor but he really has nothing to work with in this movie. It's just horrible. I can't believe I watched the whole thing.
B000002MG1|5.0|I've never really been a big REM fan. People are always telling me how great Murmur is, but I've never been able to get into it really. The only other REM album I REALLY enjoy is New Adventures in Hi-Fi, although I like Document and Reconstruction of the Fables quite a bit as well. Anyway, this is a rare album that doesn't have any problems with it. My favorite song was always Star Me Kitten, but the past few months it has changed every time I hear it; sometimes it's trying not to breathe, sometimes Find the River, etc. Anyway, this is definitely their best work and is certainly a worthwhile purchase.
B00004YA66|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. The acting was very good and the story line was excellent. It is about a son who is able to talk to his dad on his ham radio even though his dad has been dead for thirty years. He is able to warn him about a fire he was going to where he would die. This changes the course of the future and some interesting things happen. This is a very good film.
B00000JHAU|5.0|The first B&amp;S song I ever heard was Judy and the Dream of Horses and the second was Fox in the Snow. They are still my favorite songs on here, but there is nothing bad about this CD. I was watching the movie Pumpkin a few weeks ago (it was a terrible movie, by the way, in my opinion. I guess it was trying to be funny, but NO ONE really acts the way Christina Ricci did in that. Ridiculous.) and the song Stars of Track and Field is in it. There's really no point to this story, except it's a fantastic song and it sounded like it had been written for the movie. I worked as a lifeguard at a girl scout camp one summer and I always made them listen to this at the pool. I think they enjoyed that. Get Me Away From Here I'm Dying has one of the better melodies I've ever heard. So, you don't need to go off and see a minister before buying this, because it's really good.
0156027321|5.0|The Life of Pi is one of those books that brings back life into the reader. The skinny indian boy finds himself alone with a 450 pound Tiger on a lifeboat after he lost his family in a ship wrek while trying to travel from India to Canada. The existence of the tiger keeps Pi going with his long days, not because they become best friends but not wanting to be lonely through the days and nights forces him to approach his disaster differently.<br />Once you start the trip with Pi, you can't stop. You always wonder what will happen next, and finally when you finish you start going back to earlier details to live it again.<br />It is strange how relationships start, and end. It is strange how we find comfort in things we never expect, and it is even more strange how we force life to go on sometimes without being convinced...<br />Pi wished he did things differnetly at the end, but don't we all sometimes?
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad provides brillinat out of the box thinking about money and wealth.  It's a must read.  In addition, make sure you read Optimal Thinking by Rosalene Glickman Ph.D. (Wiley 2002) to learn how to make the best choices and OPTIMIZE every situation.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|When this album was released, I had lots of thoughts. Now, old metal bands are drowning in the nu-metal bullcr*p such as Metallica and I thought this one doesn't have great guitar solos, but I heard it and I was able to breathe. Well, it isn't bad after all. The best tracks are &quot;Dance of Death&quot; and the outstanding &quot;Paschendale&quot;. Outstanding album and thank God Maiden still exist and still strong. Maiden rules. I recommend this album for the people who are suffering this nu-metal bulls**t.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I remember going down to Bleecker Street Cinema in 1980 to see this film on the big screen.  The place was rockin' that night; it was the next best thing to a Who concert.  If you have a big TV, a decent stereo, and this DVD, the next best thing can be in your living room.  Previous DVD and VHS versions of this film were pale imitators of the original.  Now, you can see the film as only those who saw it in theaters previously had.  The restoration is flawless, the sound rocks, and the complete &quot;A Quick One While He's Away&quot; is finally back.  The price is worth it for that one track alone - probably one of the best live tracks ever recorded by the best live act ever.  If you love The Who, this is a must have.  If you've never appreciated The Who, you will after watching this.
B000089RVR|5.0|I absolutely LOVED (and still do) \\"No Angel\\"- one of my all time favorites....so that said, I was EAGERLY awaiting Dido's sophmore effort. O.k so originally, I gave this CD 3 stars and called it \\"a disappointment\\" But oh, how my opinon has changed! Have you ever noticed that the albums you find to be originally \\"boring\\" after repated listens becomes great? That is what happend to me.  No Angel was a glimpse of her ability, but Life for Rent cements her talent.<BR>She sings beautifully, her full range is not emphasized on this album- however, the truthful and wonderfully written lyrics get you, grab you, and stick in your head. There is such depth to her lyrics it is astounding- one listen is not enough. Every song is a standout- I love \\"Who makes you feel\\", \\"This land is mine\\" \\"White flag\\"...wait a  minute I LOVE every song. Seriously, I am telling you give it REPEATED listens, it WILL grow on you. I listen to this album really everyday. She is great. By it now! Trust me! :)
B00008CLOA|5.0|Initially I was upset when I found out this title would only be on SACD as I only had a DVD-Audio player at the time. I recently upgraded to SACD and this was the first disc I tested. <br />The multi-channel mix truly needs to be experienced to be appreciated. Everything is perfect: loud and clear. If you like DSOTM in the slightest you will like it a lot more this way. This disc will become the default SACD demo disc. <br />I will say that I did not like the 2 channel stereo mix as much as the Mobile Fidelity Gold disc. It just seemed muddied and off. (Albeit this was only tested in my car)<br />Hopefully the Floyd will remix the rest of their splendid catalog for SACD multi-channel. Better yet just release ALL new releases as hybrid SACD's. That way the public can upgrade when they are ready and the audiophiles can have more software!
0783225849|5.0|THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE SLASHER MOVIE GENRE. BEFORE FREDDY, BEFORE JASON, BEFORE MICHAEL MYERS, AND BEFORE LEATHERFACE, THERE WAS NORMAN BATES. IF ALL YOU CAN REMEMBER ABOUT THIS CLASSIC IS THE FAMOUS SHOWER SCENE, THEN YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE AGAIN. A WOMAN [JANET LEIGH] SPENDS THE NIGHT AT A MOTEL THAT'S RUN BY NORMAN BATES [ANTHONY PERKINS] AND HIS ''MOTHER''. SOON, SHE IS MURDERED BY NORMAN AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, HER MURDER GETS INVESTIGATED BY THE POLICE. A DEFINITIVE CLASSIC ON ALL LEVELS. VERY THRILLING, VERY EXCITING, VERY CLEVER, AND VERY IMAGINATIVE. IT'S BEEN 43 YEARS SINCE THIS CLASSIC WAS FIRST RELEASED AND THERE STILL HASN'T BEEN A HORROR MOVIE THAT COMPARES TO THIS ONE. IF YOU'RE GONNA SEE AN ALFRED HITCHCOCK FILM, THIS IS THE ONE TO SEE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THIS FILM PAVED THE WAY FOR MANY IMITATORS. FOLLOWED BY THREE SEQUELS [THE LAST ONE WAS MADE FOR CABLE TV IN 1990], A TV MOVIE [BATES MOTEL], AND WAS REMADE IN 1998.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Although some fans may be dismayed at yet another Donna Summer compilation, this one is different. Universal has remastered the tracks for the best sounding compilation ever. The standard CD includes 2 new tracks, &quot;That's The Way&quot; and &quot;I Will Live For Love&quot;. The limited edition release includes a bonus CD with remastered 12&quot; versions of &quot;I Feel Love&quot; and &quot;This Time I Know It's For Real&quot;, as well as a remix of &quot;I Will Live For Love&quot; and the underground hit &quot;You're So Beautiful&quot;.<br />A word to those aforementioned &quot;fans&quot; who feel that they have been ripped off by Ms. Summer - the RECORD LABEL puts out the compilations, not the artist. This is the first time in a decade that Ms. Summer had anything to do with a compilation being released. Universal is to be commended for this remastered gem as well as the remastered Bad Girls which was released this summer. Universal also listened to the fans and included &quot;You're So Beautiful&quot; at the last minute. The success of these two releases will dictate whether Universal remasters the rest of Donna Summer's extensive catalog as well as whether they will re-sign her to a Universal label (she left Sony in the wake of the Mottola departure).
B00006690G|4.0|I GOTTA GIVE PROPS TO EM ON HIS 4TH ALBUM. EM STILL SHOWS THE MEDIA THAT HE JUST DON'T GIVE A F*** WHAT MOTHERF*****S THINK BOUT HIM. SONGS LIKE ''SING FOR THE MOMENT'', WHICH SAMPLES AEROSMITH'S ''DREAM ON'' PERFECTLY, AND ''HAILIE'S SONG'', A SONG IN WHICH EM ACTUALLY SINGS [!] ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER SHOW JUST HOW TALENTED EMINEM REALLY IS. ONLY SONGS THAT DISSAPOINT ARE ''SOLDIER'' AND ''SAY GOODBYE TO HOLLYWOOD''. OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS A NEAR PERFECT ALBUM. ONE OF THE BEST RAP ALBUMS FROM 2002.
B00005JMCT|1.0|Maybe the worst movie i've ever seen. Boring, very TALENTLESS actors, and bad jokes. Primitive film for primitive people.
B00005JM1F|1.0|I love a good comedy,and enjoy SNL almost everyweek,and missed Will Ferrell when he left the cast,but HATED this OLD GRADE SCHOOL COMEDY.There is a couple of funny scenes,but not enough laughs to make me want to watch this DVD again.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I first heard about this soundtrack when the actor James Woods recommended it in an interview. I rented the movie first and then knew I had to have the CD. &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; is so appealing, it takes you back in time and yet you can identify with the lyrics today. &quot;You are my sunshine&quot; is a great track too, and a nice surprise, since the first time I heard the song, it was done very differently by Delbert McClinton! But my favorite is the hobo song &quot;Big rock candy mountain&quot; that brings back a lot of memories from my childhood. Children love the music too and my baby girl is a 'bonafide' bluegrass fan thanks to this wonderful CD.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I must be from another planet.I've read so many great reviews of &quot;Chicago&quot;.I LOVED &quot;Cabaret,&quot;Loved the music from the play I heard over the years,Loved Fosse's work,but HATE THIS FILM.Its HORRIBLE.If your having trouble sleeping at night,buy this DVD.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I'll have to admit that I was shying away from this CD because I felt that she was getting too much hype. But I found &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; so compelling that I gave her a chance. Folks, this beautiful young lady is extremely talented. She writes well. I love &quot;Lonestar&quot; and her rendition of Hank Williams Senior's (the original king of Rock and Roll in my humble opinion) &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; is a nice surprise. Very relaxing romantic and soothing. Worth it to add to your collection.
079073463X|5.0|LadyHawke is a movie that will always be in my collection!Its a wonderful tale of a boy who escapes from an unescapable prison only to end up helping out two lovers who are cursed.The man turns into a wolf during the night and the woman,a hawk during the day.Its a beautifully done story of how faith keeps us going so that we may face the ones who would try to stop us from getting what it is that we deserve.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a hilarious, yet sweet movie that I would recommend for anyone, French speaking or not.  After the first 10 minutes, one forgets that there are subtitles.  Not to be missed!
630027179X|2.0|I'm a big fan of the Arthurian Legends and this movie hurts me deep down.I kept thinking this would be a great movie and my mythology teacher even praised it before letting the class watch most of it but guess what folks?It seems my mythology teacher is just stupid!!!The people in my class were either making fun of the movie,sleeping or doing their homework because the movie seemed so lame.I tried to watch it but the facts weren't 100% correct as I was expecting,the actors were terrible and don't get me starting on the &quot;dazzling effects and time&quot; that they put into this movie.If you're bored one day then I dare you to try and watch this movie,otherwise forget it.The only good part of this movie was the character Morganna or Morgan le Fay as we normally call her.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Originally, when I first purchased this film/DVD (on the strength of John Cusack's acting), I wrote a review of which the subject line was: WENT FROM OKAY&gt;REDEMPTION&gt;BLEW IT<BR>I did not realize the significant impact this film had until, days and even a week later, I found myself thinking about it... a lot!<BR>This film is VERY smart. The acting is superb. The cinematography &amp;  set design/location creates an eerie surrealism that will keep nipping away the world we think is real until it lays exposed.  Of course, I will also give EXTENSIVE credit to the director, James Mangold (who also directed GIRL INTERRUPTED among others) - his hand is masterful.  If you're not surprised by the plot-twist in this film then you must have prescient powers.<BR>It's so refreshing to see a unique twist nowadays and this one has a masterstroke AND, as many reviewers have stated, &quot;IT IS FUN!&quot;.<BR>It does not rely on gross, gore or SLAMMING musical shocks to get the point across.  ENJOY.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Possessing a superb voice, soulfull and full of character and seeming old beyond her years Norah Jones is just incredible.  She reminds me in so many ways of singers like Rickie Lee Jones (who her voice is a bit similar too), Nina Simone and Ella Fitzgerlad.  This lady was born to sing jazz and blues.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I already liked The Who when I first saw The Kids are Alright at a University of Texas theater around 1984, but based on the '70's and '80's radio hits and HBO concert special I was familiar with, I didn't understand why metal kids I knew who swore by Rush drove hundreds of miles to see them in Dallas, or why punks considered them the first punk rock band.  Until I saw the movie!  The Kids are Alright is the perfect distillation of this incredible band, from the striking visual spectacle of them performing live, to Keith Moon's spontaneous lunacy, to Peter Townshend's caustic wit, to the thunderous noise they made, and the stages they left looking like fresh battlefields.  Though this movie is more in the nature of a audio/visual collage rather than a chronological history of The Who, watching this you will understand who Messrs. Townshend, Daltrey, Entwhistle and Moon are (or were), and what all the fuss was about.  As bonuses on this dvd set (besides the cleaned up audio and picture), you get an interesting commentary by the director that conveys the labor of love that this movie was for him, and a revealing interview with Roger Daltrey that provides some fascinating insight on The Who's music and the movie.  All in all, if you care about a kind of music known as rock 'n' roll, you must own this. The Kids are Alright is brash, angry, rude, violent, dangerous, and VERY, very funny.
0064407667|4.0|This is entertaining, well- written, and multi- leveled  book was written by an author who recognizes children's right to read a book without being bombarded by morals and sappiness.
B0000844MP|4.0|I've seen all the reviews -- &quot;overrated&quot;, &quot;terrible&quot;.  I enjoy this movie, but I do so because I watch it knowing that it is a wildly dramatic, romantic, epic tragedy.  <br />If you enjoyed Pearl Harbor, or Gone With The Wind, you'll probably enjoy Legends of the Fall.  All of the actors are beautiful, the cinemetography is amazing, and with the exception of Julia Ormond (who plays Susannah as weak and insipid), the actors all turn in great, underrated performances.  <br />Brad Pitt, a fine actor who continues to be punished by critics for his sheer beauty, did a great job with a script that could have easily been over-acted - few actors could portray the depth of emotions he does and still seem masculine. Aidan Quinn was wonderful, playing the pathos of the &quot;second fiddle&quot; character with dignity and strength.  He captured the essence of his character in a scene when he confronts his brother (Pitt) with the irony of his life:  &quot;I followed all the rules...and everyone still loved you best.&quot;  <br />Anthony Hopkins is, as always, a joy to watch, though the scenes after his stroke are a little over-done.  His ability to balance the tragedy of this character's illness with his strength is a testament to his talent.<br />So don't expect something edgy or action-based.  Legends of the Fall is a great film, if you're know what your're getting when you buy (or rent) it.
B000059HAI|2.0|Tora! Tora! Tora! is one those epic, cast-of-thousands, documentary-style WWII movies that Hollywood was fond of back in the 60's and 70's. It does a few things well: it sticks closely to the facts (at least as I understand them), shows the conflict from both sides without any blatant bias, and culminates in an extended depiction of the attack on Pearl Harbor. (It actually goes a little over the top there and starts to feel a bit like an action movie parody at some points: just when you think it's over, it keeps going and going and going.)<br />The big flaw is that the film forgets that war isn't just about battles, but also about people. The characters rarely/barely register--surely their real-life counterparts were more interesting--and the few prominent actors, like Jason Robards, fail to make much of an impression. Compare the classic D-Day documentary-style epic, The Longest Day. That film also stays close to the facts and shows the battle intelligently from both sides. Unlike the plodding Tora! Tora! Tora!, it keeps you engaged by featuring both historical realism and very memorable characters (based on real people, as in Tora! Tora! Tora!) memorably played by a who's who of great actors: Richard Burton, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, John Wayne, Sean Connery, Eddie Albert, Curd Juergens, and many more. You can say the same sorts of complimentary things about the epic A Bridge Too Far, which is vastly better written, directed, and acted than Tora! Tora! Tora!. <br />Tora! Tora! Tora! is surprisingly dry and boring most of the time, especially considering the dramatic, historically vital subject. There are many far better WWII films: The Longest Day, A Bridge Too Far, Twelve O'Clock High, The Great Escape, Patton, Das Boot, Stalingrad, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, Enemy at the Gates, The Thin Red Line, to name just a few.<br />Still, despite the longeurs and often forgettable characters, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a decent introduction to a pivotal battle inworld history. It tries to let the facts speak for themselves instead of resorting to cheap melodrama or sentimentality. It's just not good as a dramatic film; history and drama should go together, not be opposed.
6305291446|4.0|Okay I am a big fan of the Halloween films, and I will have to give you a little history of the Halloween films, before I will give you my input on H20. Okay the first Halloween was a classic, when we are introdcued to the boogeyman Michael Myers who escapes from a mental instution and goes on a killing spree in Haddonfield and almost tries to kill his sister Lauire Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). The second film, Halloween II is a contuation of the first. We see that Michael Myers was not killed in the first film and tracks Laurie Strode all the way to the hospital where he tries to ensue his finally move. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) tries to warn everyone about how evil he is. Michael Myers is burned. Okay lets skip ahead a year or two later, and for some stupid reason we have Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, which has nothing to do with Michael Myers. Now lets go even further to the late 80's where the next real Halloween film is released, HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERs. Kind of a soggy campy film with no taste and can't live up to the orignial. Michael Myers apparently has been in acoma for 10 years since his crispy escapid in II. He awakens on a killing spree of teens looking for his seven year old niece - Jamie Llyod. Of course, Dr. Loomis returns to Haddonfield after a 10 year absence to find Michael Myers once again. The film ends with a fiery show down and Michael is buried. But his niece is haunted by the unspeakable evil her uncle has, and stabs her Mom with a pair of siccors. Okay lets skip one year later, to Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers. This is even more dumb then 4.  Jamie Llyod is placed in Haddonfield's Children's Hopsital, after attacking her mother with a pair of siccors. Jamie is being treated by Dr. Loomis along with her foster sister Rachel and her friend Tina, until Michael Myers come back once again, after a year in acoma after 4. Dr. Loomis decides the only way to end all of this is to lure Michael to the Myers house with Jamie. But a man in black has arrived in town with a startling connection to Michael. Lets skip ahead 7 years later, with the scariest Halloween film of all - Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers. It's now six years since the last Halloween celebration in Haddonfield. Michael Myers, his niece Jamie, and the mysterious Man in Black all disappeared after the explosive end of Part 5. Everyone assumes them all to be dead...but actually, Jamie has been captured by the Man In Black, who has her impregnated her. A now grown up Jamie delievers the baby on Halloween eve. But Michael is back, and is looking for her and her baby. Jamie dies, and a hunt goes on to protect the baby with the help of Dr. Loomis. The Man in Black is a good old friend to Dr. Loomis who holds a cult of unspeakable evil that Myers can't escape. Okay let's skip two more years later, where we finally have Halloween 7, offically titled Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later. We are introduced back to Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curits) who teaches at a private school, and stays safetly seculded, under the name of Keri Tate. Just as she is getting back to her old self, Michael once again reappears in her life wanting to finish off what he did in the beginning. Michael at first ransacks Dr. Loomis office in Haddonfield which he has passed away between the Curse of Michael Myers and H20. (And in real life, RIP Donald Pleasence) The film ends as Michael butchers a bunch of teens leaving a conclusion that Laruie chops his head off and finally puts her past away - FOR THE MOMENT. Halloween H20 was probably the best Halloween sequel with the best story, but it's not the scariest. Miramax should have ended the sereis with H20 and the franchise wouldn't have spoiled. Instead they made the stupid, Halloween 8: Resurrection. Which is really dumb. Supposidly, that wasn't Michael who she killed in H20. Of course Laurie finally kills herself before Michael can get to her and a bunch of people are murdered in a Halloweenparty. Then Miramax is planning a Halloween 9. The Plot: MICHAEL IS GOING WITH A SHOWDOWN WITH PINHEAD, how stupid. H20 was good and they should have left it with that.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's music is outstanding!!!. They distinguish themselves from everything else out there by producing nothing but some of the most original melodies in music today. You can easily tell that they have been influenced by some of the greatest bands, ie.( verve, oasis, pink floyd,) but their style is all their own. with all the other garbage that is being played out there today, is good to know that there are still bands making awesome music. Coldplay right now are the absolute best there is.
B00000GBHA|5.0|I first heard Rodriguez in the back of a VW bug hitch hiking up the West coast of Australia in July of 1984. Two women picked me up and I remember them asking what I would like to listen to. I said anything you like. They put on Cold Fact and I was hooked. I bought the cassette before leaving back to the states. I played it for years until it got sucked into my car stereo... a sad day! Fortunately I had taped a few of the songs onto other mixed tapes in the 80's. Occasionally I will pop one in and up will come \\"I wonder\\" or \\"Crucify your Mind\\" and I smile. I've always felt a bit special that I had discovered of the most brilliant albums and folk rock musicians of all time and wondered why no one in America had ever head of him. I looked for years for any sign of his work here with no clues. I thought he had passed on. Thanks to the internet I discovered he is alive and still singing to his fans in South Africa. I was thrilled to find an imported copy on CD on Amazon. I once again can enjoy his work. I hope you too will discover the rich, intelligent, kind and haunting voice and music of Rodriguez and share it with others. You will have something special.
B000002B1M|5.0|This man is amazing.  How does he keep doing it.  Not as good as Illmatic but it is still a classic. I consider this to be his third best album, behind Illmatic and Stillmatic.  He has shades of Illmatic on this album.  Plus he also has a 2Pac diss called &quot;The Message&quot;.  He was the only one with enough balls to diss 2Pac.  Don't get me wrong 2Pac is still the greatest to ever clutch a mic.  In conclusion go get this album ASAP.  This is hip-hop in it's truest form.  Go cop it TODAY!!!
B000002UCN|2.0|This is not \\"The Best Of George Harrison\\".  These are songs that were on albums by The Beatles (which I have most of them).  I know George sung and wrote them, but they should've put more of his songs on here, not songs he did with The Beatles.  There are about six songs on here that were from his own albums, but that was it.<br />I'm sure everybody and their momma has heard, \\"My Sweet Lord\\" (still one of my fav songs he ever did; I can never get sick of this song, I can play this song over and over again, I'll never get tired of it).  I never heard the song \\"You\\" before.  I thought it was really nice.  I also never heard \\"Dark Horse\\" or \\"Bangla Desh\\"; they were pretty good as well.  On the song \\"Dark House\\" George didn't sound too good, his voice wasn't the same; I love this song.  I've read he was sick during that song, I don't know why he didn't wait until he felt better before making the track; but to be honest, I like the way he sounds on this song, he has a squeaky voice. I've got to get more George Harrison albums; they're so hard to find nowadays, he was such an underrated artist.  If you're a George Harrison/Beatles fan, then you can get this if you want, but I wouldn't waste my money on this, it's mostly songs from The Beatles albums.  George Harrison fan beware, this is not \\"The Best Of George Harrison\\".
B00009RDG9|2.0|Halfway through this I wondered if in fact I was watching a parody of the Fugitive. <BR>How either of these actors agreed to be a part of this over the top, ultra cliched, poorly executed mess is anyone's guess. The plot and scripting don't get much worse although there are a few moments of decent action but you've really seen it all before. Pretty blah editing and direction to boot. <BR>Watch out for a re-enactment of Predator in last 10 minutes before an overly bloody and tacky close.<BR>One redeeming factor for The Hunted is that it was refreshing to watch a film that ended predictably without resorting to a trendy twist that a lot of films employ these days 'to set them apart'.
0898705525|4.0|Orthodoxy is not the book I thought it would be.  I really expected a rigorous, systematic defence of orthodox doctrine.  Instead, I read a rousing autobiography, which left me in continued awe of the author, but rather bemused about Chesterton's mental habits.<br />First off, Chesterton in relation to various heresies (in particular secularism), is a bit like a drunken man with a sledgehammer in a china shop.  Not an angry drunk, but a happy, wild-eyed, well-practiced drunk.  Chesterton's intellect so thoroughly overpowers the counterarguments that he sometimes seems at a loss as to which direction to swing the hammer.  So he muddles cheerfully along, smashing a bit of Nietzchism here, crushing a Socialist argument there.  And through it all he seems painfully aware of the oncoming post-modern society, in which the ultimate secular virtue of tolerance would leave us oblivious to rational argument.<br />Orthodoxy is replete with classic Chesterton.  He makes his points with precise metaphors that waste no words.  A particular favorite of mine is his argument against the relativist effort to remove value from physical or abstract objects.  Chesterton cites the title of a work called &quot;the Love of Triangles&quot; and points out that if Triangles are loved for anything, they are loved for being triangular.<br />As with The Everlasting Man, Chesterton provides his readers with a neat intellectual trick that can be used for self-analysis.  In Orthodoxy, the trick is the reduction of conversation to monosyllabic sentences.  Chesterton has found another key characteristic of the modern world here - the tendency of people to adopt a complex language for the express intent of not saying anything at all.  Anyone familiar with the sciences will understand the necessity of precision in language, combined with the maddening inability of the words themselves to convey the desired meaning.  As an example, I refer to isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic polymers.  These terms refer to the pattern of orientation in polymer chains.  Is it possible to infer that from the terminology?  Our language is full of adopted &quot;scientific&quot; nomenclature that contains meaning of which we are unaware.  One of these days, I'm going to state a hyperthesis and wait for someone to point out my spelling error.<br />But I digress.  Chesterton's recognition is that the more complex our language, and the more specialized its application, the less meaning the language itself conveys.  Witness the confusion over the terms &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;progressive,&quot; cited by Chesterton as examples.  Anyone familiar with the modern (American&quot; connotations of these words will recognize that &quot;liberal&quot; is someone who wants to limit free speech, have government control over the economy, mandate the membership of the Boy Scouts, and dictate how many gallons of water can be contained in your toilet tank.  Progressive is simply someone who wants to progress back to the 60's.  The meanings of the words are a far cry from the definition of the words.<br />Chesterton supplies the antidote - one syllable words only.  While this is obviously of limited utility, it's a nice exercise (like trying to cook breakfast using only your left hand, if you're right handed).  His point is well taken - the one-syllable words are pretty hard to confuse or confute, and they're remarkably handy.  They're also anathema to wordy people like me.<br />I cannot, of course, help compare Chesterton's autobiographical Orthodoxy with Augustine's Confessions.  I shudder to think that it is the different audiences that define the difference in these books, but in any case here is a contrast between a brilliant ancient writer and a brilliant modern writer, both explaining how they came to accept Christ and His Church.  Where Augustine is expansive, structured, precise and deeply interested in addressing each of the many ways we might consider the phenomenon of &quot;memory,&quot; Chesterton is rambling, concise, and chaotic in his visualization of madness and genius.<br />Finally (yes!  Finally!) I have to admit that I remain unconvinced of Chesterton's hyperthesis of sanity.  Where Chesterton sees sanity as the result of a tension between two extremes (in fact, two poles), I suspect that it is such tension that generally &quot;cracks&quot; people's heads (in most cases the tension between perceived reality and reality-by-policy).<br />Chesterton, however, will get the better of me with such arguments as: &quot;To accept everything is an exercise, to understand everything is a strain.  The poet only desires exaltation and expansion, a world to stretch himself in.  The poet only asks to get his head into the heavens.  It is the logician who seeks to get the heavens into his head.  And it is his head that splits.&quot;<br />Magnificent!ot; Chesterton is rambling, concise, and chaotic in his visualization of madness and genius.<br />Finally (yes!  Finally!)

7119005901|5.0|And it's about time too. Moss Roberts does an excellent job of translating the epic novel by Luo Guanzhong in a full, unabridged four book series. Previously I had read an abridged version by the selfsame translator, and while I was impressed with the story, it was too choppy to satisfy me. I later found this unabridged version, purchased it at once and loved every moment of reading. This is it. The definitive \\"Three Kingdoms\\".<br />\\"The Three Kingdoms\\" is based on the era known as The Three Kingdoms period, or San Guo Yan Yi. This period chronicles the decline of the Han to the rise of the Jin dynasty (circa AD 170-260). The story tells the tale of protagonist Zhuge Liang (referred to as Kongming throughout the story) and his efforts to help his lord Liu Bei (referred to as Xuande throughout the story) unite the land and restore the crumbling Han. You see, Liu Bei is a distant cousin of the child emperor, Liu Xian, who is manipulated by the malicious despot, Cao Cao. Bei, a poor mat weaver, steps up to the plate and helps to put down the Yellow Scarf rebellion under Zhang Jue and the story takes off from there. Zhuge Liang does not actually come into the story until much later and dies in the middle of the fourth volume, but his importance is immeasurable.<br />This story is a must-read for history fans as well as fans of any of the video game series about the time period (Dynasty Warriors, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dynasty Tactics, etc.). Fans of the video game series will love to hear tales of their favorite characters, such as Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and many more.<br />An important thing to keep in mind when reading Luo Guanzhong's novel is that it is a biased account of the events. Luo Guanzhong is what I call a pro-Shuist, or someone who supports Shu (the kingdom ruled by Liu Bei), so Shu feats may be embellished and fans of the other kingdoms (Wei, Wu) might be frustrated as many of their favorite characters will not be viewed as positively as theymay deserve to be.<br />With this in mind, \\"The Three Kingdoms\\" is a fun, if not lengthy, read and will keep you turning the pages. The story isn't terribly difficult to follow but some may have trouble keeping track of the cast of characters (some 600 plus characters in all) and all of their names. What I mean by 'all of their names' is that the chinese had the surname (Zhuge), the given name (Liang) and a style (Kongming). Some officers are called by all three names and it can be difficult to follow. Zhuge Liang is called many things over the course of the novel, in addition to his surname, given name and style, but it shouldn't be to hard to follow. Probably easier then following my explanation of it, at any rate.<br />My major complaint with this edition (and it is minor) is the poor proofreading and the poor quality of the paper and binding. This book was published to Beijing standards and would not meet American standards. You will have to be a little careful with the book while reading it, but that's not too big of a problem. Also, the typos (two or three a chapter) can get annoying and make you wonder who was proofreading the book and make you think that you could do a better job (and you probably could).<br />That aside, this is a very enjoyable story and you will not be disappointed in buying the four-volume unabridged set translated by Moss Roberts.

0385512104|4.0|This is the debut novel of writer Mark Haddon who does a formidable job delivering a fresh and unique book. This is a choice book to read if you are tired of reading the same types of books. This may not be a great book but its definately a worthwhile read that everyone should check out(from the library).
B00005JM0B|1.0|Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this movie as humanly possible.  It is 10lbs of monkey crap in a 5lbs bag!  It was made purely for 14 year olds to watch all of the explosions and fighting and is missing the most essential piece, a story.  Also, the acting flat out stinks.
B000089RVR|5.0|This cd is incredible. I am blown away by every track on it! Every song has an emotional, almost heart wrenchingly beautiful quality to it. Even the dance track STONED(My favorite on the album) has a sadly emotive gentleness to it!<br />Favorites of mine are...<br />Stoned, White Flag, Life For Rent, Don't Leave Home, and See The Sun.<br />Buy this album right now! Dido has truly created a stunning album here (in my opinion, Better than it's successor)...<br />God Bless You Dido for making such amazing music!
B00005JLET|1.0|No matter how many times I watch this movie, I never get whats it about...When I recieved this as birthday gift last year, I didn't have either high or low expectations... All I know is that when I recieved Kiki's Delivery Service the year before, I didn't think it would be any good, but when I actually watched it, I LOVED it. So, since this was by the same creator, I thought I'd give it a chance...And, well, I was a little bored. First of all, im not really sure this has any plot. It really just felt like watching a chain of un-realated events. Secondly, I didn't find the charectors as likeable as those in Kiki's...Chihiro is a kind of annoying. So is her freind, Lynn. And third, it felt like a waste of time and money (spent by the gift-giver). I had the&gt;ehem&lt;Pleasure of having to watch it about 5 times in my Visual Arts class...Overall,im probably never going to watch it again. As for Kikis Delivery Service, I just popped it in this very morning...
B000000HSU|4.0|Rock for Light is propalby supposed to be a better version of the first album while aslo adding some new tracks for the listeners. Well, ovbiously this is an issue that will split oppinions. my oppinion is that thwe sound here is less dynamic and energetic (=worse) tahn on the first album, the performances lack some of the band's unique PMA (Positive Mental Attitude) and the vocals and instrumentations aren't just up to the level of their first release. Nevertheless, there are some true classics on this album that are lacking from their legendary debut relese. Especially tracks like &quot;At the Movies&quot;, &quot;Coptic Times&quot; and the title track make this album worth owning.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I was hearing buckets of praise for this latest effort from the White Stripes, so I decided I might as well see what the buzz is all about and I was definitely surprised.  Elephant is an accomplished, stylish and above all fun record, a true pleasure to listen to.  It's great to see the resurgence of stripped down rock and roll after years and years of polish and ProTools.  That said, this is not the classic its being hailed as, although it is great effort.  Jack White seems to be an artist that improves with each successive effort, and I'm anxious to see what he cooks up with next.  Ultimately however, I feel the 2-piece formula is restricting to this great artist; playing with only a marginally talented drummer for accompaniment doesn't do Jack White justice.  That's why the songs that have bass (or a guitar using an effect to sound like one) are refreshing.  But it's the songs, not the sound that determines the White Stripe's strength.  And there are plenty of great songs on this record.  <br />\\"Black Math\\" is a blistering piece of punk rock fury, beautifully abrasive and loud; when the tempo changes and Jack White adopts his trademark stuttering squeal it becomes clear that this song is a classic.  \\"There's No Home For You Here\\" does indeed steal the chords and structure from White Blood Cell's \\"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\\", but when it's presented in such fine form, who cares?  The cover of Burt Bacharach's \\"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself\\" is an exceptional squall of fuzz and dissonance, probably not what Burt had in mind.  Meg White takes the mic for \\"In the Cold, Cold Night\\", and does a great job of adding a seductive air to the sparse arrangement.  \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\" is another highlight, sporting a killer thump beat and great nonsensical lyrics.  Changing up the normal `Strips formula is \\"The Air Near My Fingers\\", dominated by a wacky organ arrangement.  Elephant closes with a great duet between Jack, Meg and English singer/songwriter Holly Gollighty called \\"It's True We Love One Another\\", an incredibly catchy, fun song to listen to.  <br />There are a few missteps here and there, notably \\"Ball and Biscuit\\", which goes on for a few minutes too long and \\"Little Acorns\\", which is more of a story than a song.  Nevertheless, despite a few shortcomings, the White Stripes fulfill there potential more often than not on Elephant.  Every fan of raw, sweaty, stripped down rock n' roll owes it to themselves to pick up a copy of Elephant and enjoy it.  It's definitely one of the best records of the year.
0060922583|5.0|This book is so much about THOUGHT MANIFESTING everything and the very special powers which lie dormant in all of us. This book tells and explains the physical realities of where these pwoers lay stored and makes much mention of how people are able to tap into these powers and use them to change their lives. It is full of information on auras, seeing with the minds eye, chakras and takes all of this and mixes it with physical evidence and how the body workes to make all of this not only a possibility but a fact for all of us.  Why we see the way we do (and all that is before us that we unconsciously are choosing not to see), etc. It is an incredible book, really,  and anyone doing Reiki, hand on healing, aura work, psychic work or practicing to be a Shaman NEEDS to read this book to fully understand their potential power.<br />Don't let the title fool you.. while it is full of information on holograms and how we see what we want to see, I believe that the book is more about our own powers and manifestations and how powerful we are/can become. The author clearly believes and shares so much of his own journey in this book. It is fantastic. One of the best books I've read all year. Buy it - read it and change the way you see the world!

B00005JM02|5.0|ASIDE from the spectacular animation, the laughs, and the endearing characters - this film has great educational value. For whatever reason, I grew up with an...uneasiness...around people with handicaps. By the end of the film I was completely oblivious to the fact two of the main characters were physically or mentally challenged. Dora, in fact, was one of the most charming characters I've seen in film recently - animated or not.<br />I also (as a divorced father) greatly appreciated a single FATHER being portrayed as loving and capable. Too much of media shows men, if not actually villains, as bumbling or careless - if they're present at all.<br />BRAVO! The film is so entertaining you hardly notice positive lessons are being reinforced.

Reading the reviews, I was absolutely astonished at one of them who complained it was only interesting to Batman fans - then who is going to be buying it pray tell, if not Batman fans ? It is - believe it or not - a BATMAN book !<br />Its wonderful, and memorable. Not many in this genre can have that said about them !
0385504209|4.0|Note:  if you are a Biblical literalist who idealizes the life of Jesus, this novel will likely be one to set aside with all the rest of the unapproved literature.<br />For me this book was a quick and clever read, and I enjoyed the plot twists and turns, the puzzles, and the bits of religious and art history (whether accurate or inaccurate).  I did want deeper character development, and the ending was a bit of a letdown in some ways, but overall this book entertained me.<br />Few reviewers have commented on the shadowy Priory of Sion, said to be a kind of secret forerunner to the Rosicrucians, the Knights Templar, and even the Masons.  I looked around a bit on the Internet and found sites that insisted on the Priory's reality and others that insisted it was a hoax.  In this novel a main function of the Priory is to safeguard the esoteric wisdom tradition handed down from Jesus to Mary Magdelene.  I've never seen any hard evidence for the claim that they married and founded a dynasty, but in the Gospel of Peter and the fragmented Gospel of Mary you can find references to Mary arousing the jealousy of the Twelve by being Jesus' favorite pupil.  Perhaps the early church deposed the true inheritor of the inner teachings right from the start.  (Check out the &quot;saint&quot; at Jesus' right hand in Leonardo's famous last supper painting.)<br />During my doctoral work on the missions of California I frequently came across people who insisted that Columbus was not a slave-owner, Cortez was not a butcher, and nearly half a million Indians did not perish of syphilis in upper and lower California, nor did the newspapers and the 49ers carry out a systematic program of genocide (&quot;purity of labor&quot; they called it in the mines).  Why?  Because it's easier not to change one's mind about what mom and dad and the church have always said was truth--conviction being safer than disillusionment even if it involves the spectacle of adults telling other adults what they can and cannot read and think.  This novel is a work of fiction, but be aware that it does raise issues that challenge the dominant patriarchal paradigm under which Christendom has operated for so many centuries.cannot read and think.

6302787300|1.0|&quot;At least Columbus had the wit, in his madness, to mistake Venezuela for the outskirts of Paradise.  But he remarked on the availability of cheap slave labor in Paradise.&quot; -- Ursula K. LeGuin<br />True to our colonial tradition of valorizing conquerors, this film ignores the inconvenient facts of New World History:  the genocide of the Tainos (Columbus himself led an attack against them), their decimation and starvation, the repartimiento and encomiendo slave systems set up by the Columbus brothers on Hispanola, and all the rest of the sordid story.  A ruthless opportunist who loved wealth and titles, Columbus went to the New World for two reasons:  he saw himself as a &quot;Christ-bearer&quot; (his own term) to primitives, and he wanted something he mentions dozens of times in his diary:  gold.<br />Were all the whites evil and all the Indians good?  Of course not.  But it is not an exercise in black-and-white thinking to remember those who perished in the gold mines, who starved to death on the roads, and who fell down in fear before the cannons brought to intimidate them into obedience.  It is their stories that the victors have silenced, glamorizing instead their persecutors and colonizers.<br />Until someone makes a more honest film about the man responsible for so much death that his actions with the Indians shocked even the Spanish crown, here are a few quotations taken directly from his own journals:<br />------------------<br />...Having banished all the Jews from all your Kingdoms and realms, during this same month of January Your Highnesses ordered me to go with a sufficient fleet to the said regions of India.  For that purpose I was granted great favors and ennobled; from then henceforward I might entitle myself Don and be High Admiral of the Ocean Sea and Viceroy and perpetual Governor of all the islands and continental land that I might discover and acquire...<br />They ought to make good and skilled servants, for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them.

These people are very free from evil and war...I have to say, Most Serene Princes, that if devout religious persons knew the Indian language well, all these people would soon become Christians.  Thus I pray to Our Lord that Your Highnesses will appoint persons of great diligence in order to bring to the Church such great numbers of peoples, and that they will convert these peoples, just as they have destroyed those who would not confess the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br />I see and know that these people have no religion whatever, nor are they idolaters, but rather, they are very meek and know no evil.  They do not kill or capture others and are without weapons.<br />Today there came to the side of the ship a canoe with six youths in it, and five came aboard.  These I ordered held and am bringing them with me.  Afterwards I sent some of my men to a house west of the river, and they brought seven women, small and large, and three children.  I did this so that the men I had taken would conduct themselves better in Spain than they might have otherwise, because of having women from their own country there with them.<br />&quot;It is said, by Las Casas among others, that what perplexed the Tainos of Espa&ntilde;ola most about the strange white people from the large ships was not their violence, not even their greed, nor in fact their peculiar attitudes toward property, but rather their coldness, their hardness, their lack of love.&quot; -- Kirkpatrick Saletever we say to them.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I was kind of baffled and confused initially upon listening to this album.  It was more mellow than expected.  The first Perfect Circle was like &quot;Tool - Light&quot; and this album was &quot;A Perfect Circle - Light&quot; in comparison.  <br />It took a good two or three listens before I really got comfortable with the sound (which I will without question say started and stayed very beautiful).  This is a perfect example of WHY A Perfect Circle is so good.  They can play music the way it's SUPPOSED to be played, but do it in a manner that's DIFFERENT.  This is a refreshingly GOOD album and will diversify and beautify anyone's record/cd Collection.
0393317552|4.0|That geography and ecology were a major determinant of human history is nothing new. However, Diamond presented the thesis in a way that is sweeping in scope and coherent in logic. For those unfamiliar with the theme, it should be an interesting read. For those who have been exposed to this kind of research, the book has left something to be desired. I found the writing style of the author to be a little ponderous, making certain passages difficult to grasp, unless the reader concentrate on the long sentences and the author's particular way of putting a sentence together. The book is repetitive on its major points. For example, that the emergence of food production is the single most important factor in human history is belabored at least 20 times in the book. <br />More seriously, I found the book to be a little unbalanced. I am ready to accept that the author's view of environmental determinism is broadly valid. However, explicitly or implicitly, the author consistently denies that racial differences played any role in the vast disparity between civilizations. The most he came to acknowledge the obvious fact is to grant that within a continent (read race), there are groups that are more innovative than others. If this is true, it is hard to see why, with the humanity taken as a whole, some races are not more innovative than others, in a well defined narrow context. <br />I am not implying racial differences are a major factor. I repeat that I agree with Diamond's view that geography and ecology were probably far more important. However, this does not mean some slight difference in racial characteristics (even if shaped by environmental factors) has not played any significant role at any time in history. To hide this issue under the rug is not what scholarship is about.
B00008O31H|5.0|I recently purchased this album after hearing about 7 or 8 track clips.  I don't care about any comparison between The White Stripes and The Black Keys.  I have not enjoyed The White Stripes music enough to provoke a purchase of one of their albums.  I will tell you that upon discovering The Black Keys and listening to about 8 track samples I purchased the &quot;Thickfreakness&quot; album on the very same day.  I really enjoy the blues rooted sounds they create.  I could go on in greater detail for some time, but I will stop with two more statments.  Most tracks on this album are carefully crafted, thoughtful, and rock filled.  <br />REPLAY FACTOR = Medium/Medium High
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Yes, I would have loved a complete album, but, this compilation is great!  More importantly, it has new songs and remixes which are fantastic and this time I won't be searching months to get a remix.  \\"Beautiful\\" is a great song and I hope it is released as a single!   A CD SINGLE WITH A RADIO EDIT VERSION IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROMOTE IT!!!  \\"That's the Way\\" is very friendly and catchy and also deserves promotion.  \\"I Will Live for Love\\"/edit and remix are also great.  Donna is blessed with a unique voice and is a great performer.  Her career is almost 30 years and still going on...she should get a good promotion for her new singles as she deserves it!!
0066214122|1.0|This was the worst piece of writing I've ever read to the finish.I read on because I couldn't actually believe how preposterously bad it was nor believe that the score or more of blurbs in the paperback could possible be authentic. It is wooden at every level -imagination, dialogue, description. Almost every character is tediously unpleasant or else their proper name is implied to be enough to flesh them out.The world described,in dozens of instances, couldn't possible correspond to any other imagination than that of an unimaginative 12 year old boy raised solely on the worst action cartoons-in fact it could have been written by Gov. Arnold.The worst part of it is this brand-Crichton-just has to move its bowels every year or two and the product is efficiently consumed in robot fashion by millions of well trained ninnies. I highly recommend The Diamond Age as an antidote.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I loved this movie, it wasn't as original as the first, but of course, that would have been impossible.  What this movie did was explain with (hold your ears \\"action junkies\\") WORDS, so much that we didn't know with the first Matrix.  This movie just gets you salivating because you know things you WANT to happen, you know things that COULD happen, but you don't know what WILL happen to end this all, because things that are SPOKEN and explained in this movie.  Just for the record, the Freeway chase scene is worth watching this movie ten times!
B000002UA5|3.0|This effort could be called Pink Floyd's Most Horrendous Disc. It is a bridge between the 60's and 70's albeit somewhat of a ship adrift on the waves in a category 5 hurricane. If one purchases Ummagumma for the live versions contained on disc one, consider the second disc as a freebie or bonus. If you only survive listening to their studio antics once, it will be worth the pain when you listen to the ECHOES compilation set. While ECHOES ignored several of the band's earlier works, this included, they did make reference to the Ummagumma studio disc by sampling that pesky fly and the birds and placing them at the beginning of High Hopes. The ECHOES collection CD front cover also gives a nod to the song, Careful With That Axe, Eugene by placing an upright axe against the wall. Even the cover design of repeating window images is based on the cover of Ummagumma. This album was important to the band even though they never came right out and said it. The band's studio antics that began with Bike's ending from 1967 continued to be refined on this 1969 \\"work in progress\\". I feel as though I have been let-in on some \\"behind the scene\\" sounds and effects experiments from a recording session for the second disc and nothing more.<br />I have chosen to comment on the abstract or historical value of Ummagumma for two reasons. (1) Everyone else that has reviewed the album has pretty well summed up everything I could have said about the content.  (2) Like much of the band's work, certain elements tend to reappear in other releases as a common bond or at least a thought, sound or lyric carried over from previous albums. Without hearing this album, at least once, you'll miss out of some of the hidden gems that would appear in the future of Pink Floyd. Another reflective example is found near the middle of the song Echoes with the weird wavering sound, something of a primordial scream and distant sounds of crows were all conceived in the studio album of Ummagumma. Without the practice of timing and mixing various sound loops, we would never have heard the cleaver beginning to DSOTM's Money. (Now, you will know where they got the bird sounds for the beginning of Sheep!) So many of their releases have a direct link back to Ummagumma that it shouldn't be totally ignored.<br />Ummagumma is definitely not worth full price but I'd still have to consider it an essential recording if only for the excellent live tracks and the exposure to the sound loops and effects that would appear on future releases. Several Species Of Small Furry Animals... is an exercise in timing tape loops and mixing unusual sounds. This one track alone helped the band to refine how they would use tape loops in the future. One must remember that these experiments were made before the digital age and about the only technologies available were reverb, echo and tremelo. Analog tapes were actually run around the studio to make a giant loop for some of the longer looping parts. Early phasing or flanging was accomplished by playing two tapes together and altering their individual speeds to create the phase shifting effect. My advice on this CD is to make someone else happy and buy their used copy. You won't feel as if you got quite as shortchanged, that way.of timing and mixing various sound loops, we would never have heard the cleaver beginning to DSOTM's Money.

B00008S2VG|4.0|I love this album and also don't see why people aren't getting it.  I'm 41, so I'm just a few years behind Madonnna in age and have to wonder if only someone in that age bracket would really get this album. To me, the songs are about feeling settled in life and with who she is as a person, while having certain concerns about the state of the world. The songs are much warmer and optimistic than much of her past work. Sure, Ray of Light and Like a Prayer were brilliant albums, but they always left me feeling sad.  I used this album all summer as my laying out soundtrack and it always left me with a warm, happy feeling. The first several tracks are excellent, esp. Hollywood, Love Profusion and Intervention.  The last four tracks are a bit lame, though not completely awful. Sounds like Madonna's been listening to some experimental electronica and maybe some old Nina Hagen stuff as well.  I'm not rich or famous, but I can relate to the feeling of a person who is more at peace with life and who they are, and that's what American Life sounds like to me. And no, contrary to one reviewer's opinion, I did not like Shanghai Surprise or Swept Away, nor would I own them. Peace out.

B00008PW3Q|4.0|I was anticipating this album along with new albums by Deep Purple (Bananas) and Cheap Trick (Special One). My three favorite bands all with new albums in the same year. Yeah!<BR>Cheap Trick was first and was a big let down, with only a few good songs and sub-par production. Deep Purple's was a pleasant surprise, a 51 minute album that never dropped the baton, from start to finish, amazing music making and wonderful production. <BR>Now comes Say You Will by Fleetwood Mac and it's almost as enjoyable as Purple's but Mac drop that baton a couple times, and perhaps that's to be expected when it's almost an 80 minute album. The production is solid, perhaps too much mid range, but it isn't quite as clean as Bananas (Deep Purple), but it's clearly better than Special One (Cheap Trick). It's great to have legendary bands still trying to make \\"good\\" music and not rest on their laurels.<br />5 stars: Bananas<BR>4 1/2 stars: Say You Will<BR>2 stars: Special One
B0000C8AUO|5.0|Unlike &quot;Heathen,&quot; which I fell in love with immediately, this album is so drastically different than anything he has done in years, that it took 3-4 full listens to have it grab ahold of me.  Many of the songs on this album bring back the flavor of his 70's work, yet with modern music technology and edge.  If you loved &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; and earlier Bowie albums, you will LOVE this album. It's destined to be a CLASSIC. Some standouts on the album are &quot;New Killer Star&quot; &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; and &quot;Never Grow Old.&quot;  He then slips effortlessly into a more &quot;sultry&quot; Bowie (the sad type of music that haunts you for hours, which he has become known for) with songs like &quot;The Loneliest Guy&quot; and &quot;Bring me the Disco King.&quot; Those two songs could be easily compared with &quot;The Motel (from 1995's &quot;Outside&quot;) and &quot;The Bewlay Brothers&quot; from the classic &quot;Hunky Dory.&quot; They are eerie and dark, and practically put you in a trance.  The title track is similar to his style on the &quot;Outside&quot; album, in that it has a very industrial feel like the song &quot;Hallo Spaceboy.&quot;  Then there are the uptempo, pop-style songs such as &quot;Days&quot; and &quot;Fall Dog Bombs the Moon.&quot;  This album is a GEM, and is Bowie at his Best in YEARS.  Vocally, it is more impressive that &quot;Heathen&quot; as his pitch is higher for nearly the whole album, sounding like the younger Bowie.  No two albums from Bowie are alike.  It's amazing. After a few listens, you will be hooked.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM to anyone, not just Bowie fans!!!

B00003CXZ1|2.0|Tomb Raider is a good idea.  It's always been a good idea, and so when I see it in the video game store or playing at the cineplex, I want to try it out, because it's such a good idea.  Unfortunately, a good idea isn't everything, and no Tomb Raider product has ever fully capitalized on the &quot;idea&quot; of Tomb Raider, and this movie is a prime example.  For roughly 100 minutes, we watch Lara Croft chase after some guy, blow stuff up, fight supernatural beings, and blah-blah-blah... why don't I care?  Because she's an adventurer, but in this film, all she does is follow the bad guy.  If you want to watch Angelina Jolie for 100 minutes, this film is good for that, so give it a rental.  Just like with the video game series, I'll keep waiting for a sequel that truly capitalizes on the good idea of Tomb Raider.
B000001EEN|4.0|The average Amazon review on this disc is 4.5 stars and I find that misleading.  When you compare this to the other live Clapton CDs, I find that it doesn't measure up on a few levels.  One is sound quality.  It's not in the ballpark of Just One Night, let alone the newer live discs.  And although the performances on the Rainbow Concert are spirited and from the heart, the band was sloppy in places - just not a tight unit in general.  So I'm stretching to give this one 4 stars.<br />But that stretch is made possible by the historical perspective.  Eric was physically and mentally down when this was recorded in 1973.  He has openly acknowledged his drug and alcolhol addictions of the early '70's, which were peaking at about the time that Pete Townshend put this show together with the specific intent of jarring Eric back to his senses.  Fortunately for all of us, Pete's hard work paid off because Eric might have never made it out of his funk without a little help from his friends.<br />This expanded CD is better than the original CD, with 8 previously unreleased cuts.  The sound quality is a slight improvement over the original CD and the original vinyl, but still nothing to write home about.  All in all, this disc is worthwhile for the Clapton collector, but no competition for Just One Night, 24 Nights or Unplugged on the basis of the music itself.

0385504209|1.0|I'll keep this simple. Dan Brown is a gifted writer but, as a storyteller, he basically sticks to similar 'rules' throughout all his books. Due to the hype, I was hoping The Da Vinci Code would be different ... it wasn't.<br />To set up the story, and get the main characters together, Brown made some huge leaps, in my opinion. His whole set-up seemed forced and extremely unlikely if we are to believe we are dealing with everyday, intelligent, professional individuals.  Poorly, poorly done.<br />I did like the research done and presented in this book.  Obviously, there will be a great deal of debate as to the accuracy of the premises but that's been going on since Jesus came on the scene two thousand years ago. Overall, Brown's presentation was well-done and easy to follow (whether or not you agree with the argument).<br />His character development is pretty much non-existent and, again, disappointing. With this book (as with all his books), Brown created a cast of, basically, static characters that I never really came to care about. But then I like character development - if it's not important to you, disregard my input.<br />Mr. Brown would do well to change his formula for his antagonists. In every single book, the 'bad guy' is obvious due to one simple rule that Brown follows. Pick the least likely individual, or the nicest and most dedicated individual (outside the hero/heroine) and you've got your antagonist. The Da Vinci Code was yet another disappointment in this regard.<br />The ending was mediocre though better than his previous work. I keep wondering when he'll get the hang of tying up a story tightly. Maybe with his next book? Doubt it but we'll see.<br />Do not buy this book in hardcover unless you want an underdeveloped storyline, static characterization, and the other things I've mentioned. Check it out from the library, borrow a friend's, wait til paperback, whatever.  Just don't pay hardcover prices for a very mediocre story. Good luck!

Adrift on the expanse of the Pacific Ocean he has no choice but to share the accommodation and make do with the arrangement.  The subsequent relationship of boy and tiger makes for fascinating reading.<br />The book is an exploration of the gamut of human emotions.  It runs from abject terror, through horror, disgust, innocent joy, excitement, resolution, defeat, boredom and so on.  Primary among the emotions examined are the nature of fear, and the resolve of purpose.  The author examines how fear can be our salvation or our undoing, it can kill us or save us.<br />By the end of the book we think we understand Pi Patel and his tiger, but Yann Martel throws us a final twist in the tale, which makes us question all our assumptions again.<br />Having read many of the accounts of survival on the ocean by sailors I can say that the life aboard this boat is accurately portrayed down to the finest detail.  Along the journey you learn a little about zoos and zoo keeping, the habits of animals and the art of survival at sea.  This is a great read, poignant, funny, bizarre and believable.
B000021XS0|5.0|this cd is beyond amazement.  the countless orgasms from which the dream theater group causes is simply wonderful.  i would recomend this cd to anyone.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Let me start by saying that metal (particularly neo-metal) is not my favorite type of music.  The genre definitely has some quality offerings, however.  This album is just plain amazing.  I thought Avenged Sevenfold's first album was good but it seemed a little scattered.  Waking the Fallen, if there is any justice in the world, should catapult these guys into the pantheon of rock gods.  Every track is a riveting epic.  The vocals sway from death-metal growls to ultra-melodic serenades.  The guitars rip seemlessly between styles and moods (check out the sweet little latin-flavored acoustic bridge sandwiched between vicious riffage, early in the album).  The drums and rhythms surprise and excite with each new track.  On top of all of that, Avenged throw in evocative and original song structures.  This is the best album of any kind, I have bought in several years.  Anyone who has the slightest interest in rock music or has the slightest inkling to try something new and amazing should buy this CD.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|&quot;1&quot; is the first--and to date, the only--Beatles CD to contain properly remastered versions of their work, and for that reason alone it is an essential purchase for anyone who claims an interest in the band (only about 1 billion of us or so...).  The music, of course, is beyond compare, although upon closer examination one interesting fact will arise: The Beatles' best work was not contained in their #1 smashes, as brilliant as they were.  &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;A Day In The Life&quot;, &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Norweigan Wood&quot;, &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot; and other single b-sides and album cuts remain the true gems in their catalogue, which means that while this CD may contain 27 extraordinary moments in sterling sound quality, the best is yet to come.  We're still waiting for the rest of the albums to be remastered like this; we can't keep buying the 1986/87 versions while every other band in existence--especially rivals like The Rolling Stones and The Who--gets the deluxe treatment.<br />One note: the audio dropout of tambourine at the end of &quot;Day Tripper&quot; has been corrected, and sounds great.  In all, this is an essential purchase.
B000022TSW|5.0|The star rating's for the movie.<br />This DVD is horrible. Certainly there's a great documentary waiting to be made on the five times Trey Parker and Matt Stone submitted their film to the MPAA or the script difficulties they had with Paramount. Someone's got to be lying to tell me there isn't a single deleted or unused animation for any cut of the film. It would be a boldfaced assumption to say that the boys couldn't have done a director's cut or something. It's just astonishing.<br />Of course, I know it's not Paramount's fault entirely -- they wanted a commentary, but they were turned down cause the pair was frustrated. Nonetheless, Paramount could have gone back and tried to amend issues instead of just letting this crap be the only digital presentation of one of the smartest, most incisive and subversive animated features ever made.<br />I mean, look at the menu. Badly manipulated generic still frames of the South Park kids holding up what are apparently construction paper squares. <br />We really need to start a petition.
B00005JLO2|1.0|Four Feathers is one of the worst remakes of a classic film ever and I regret the time and money wasted viewing it. This version, by director Shekhar Kapur, not only lacks character, it virtually lacks a storyline for anyone not familiar with the history of the period,much of which is discreetly missed or misrepresented, anyway.<br />The remake is even more pathetic given the availability of the technical advances in movie-making since the 1939 version, but possibly not advances in actors. As for the actors themselves, there wasn't much there and Kate Hudson was almost embarrassing to watch with her phony accent and complete inability to act.<br />Contributing the movie's failure could also be Kapur's long-winded style of directing.<br />I highly recommend the original, The Four Feathers (1939).
B00003CXAE|1.0|Nothing about the movie, just the DVD. And not even this DVD. More the fact that I know that next year, Paramount has another DVD of Grease coming out. No word on what's on it, but undoubtedly it will be better than this DVD. That annoys me...I know you want to make money. But...any fan of this movie, I'm sure, will tell you, that no matter how much they want the movie on DVD, they would rather stick to their well-worn VHS copies for another year and get the real deal the first time around than get the movie bare-bones and cough up the dough for it only to find out later that there's a better disc, maybe even a better set of discs in store. <br />This is only made worse by the fact that most Paramount DVDs contain a trailer and nothing else in the way of features -- their most packed DVD is the original Tomb Raider. Bleh.
B00008K7AM|3.0|I must admit.This movie was a little funny.However,I would not consider buying it on DVD.It makes a fine rentle,but paying over $20 for this DVD is not a great idea.You probably know the storyline by now,and if you don't,well thats just too bad.The storyline has been done several times in some movies such as 'The Animal' (hmmmm...).Some parts of 'The Hot Chick' were pretty lame while others could be pretty funny.This isn't Rob Schneider's most impressive acting but its not too bad.So overall,its what I said it was.A good rentle,but definitely not worth buying.Unless you warship Rob Schneider  and are his absolute biggest fan in the entire world...
0788821075|5.0|The modern classic drama \\"Pretty Woman\\", staring Richard Gere as Edward Lewis, and Julia Roberts as Vivian Ward was 1990 Smash hit.  Directed by Garry Marshall this 119 Minute film received much critical acclaim.  Julia Roberts received a 1990 Academy Award for Best actress, and 1991 Golden Globe for best actress.  This film was one of the top grossing films of 1990.<br />This romantic comedy is among the best ever, Richard and Julia had a great on screen chemistry.  Richard was playing the part of high powered business executive who was very disconnected from his feelings.  Julia was portraying a Hollywood prostitute that was just trying to survive until she could save enough money to go back to school.  They have a chance meeting and Edward ask Vivian to stay the week.  You will have to pick this one up and give it a viewing, to see how it turns out.  This film brings out many emotions, and takes a few turns, but it is very entertaining.  This film will not disappoint, if you like Julia or Richard and you have not seen this film you have to pick up today.
B00000HZHS|5.0|This is a classic album. For Nirvana. For Grunge. Even just for rock in general.<br />However, If you are the type of person who would buy Nirvana albums in the first place, you problay don't care about having the &quot;Rape Me' song edited.
0385504209|5.0|What a great book!  After reading this book, I began searching for information re Da Vinci's paintings.  It was shocking to look at the Last Supper &amp; Madonna (original version) now.<br />Enjoy!
B000002H70|5.0|I can't even put into words how absolutely amazing this album is.  All of the songs are so overwhelmingly beautiful.  They hover for gorgeous lengths of time, transporting you into the dark dream-world of Robert Smith.  The whole album feels like you're in a dream, or floating on a cloud.  The album NEVER gets boring, even if you listen to it a million times.  You might not totally absorb it on the first listen, but give it a few spins, and I guarantee it will become your favorite album ever.<br />If you want to hear something incredible, buy Disintegration.  ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL.
B000001Y5J|5.0|When Nine Inch Nails first came onto the scene with &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; back in '89, they had much more of a techno-industrial thing going, almost 80's dance-esque type stuff. Just go check it out, it is an amazing album nonetheless. Not their best in my opinion, but hey, onto the &quot;Broken&quot; EP. As NIN always has done, Trent Reznor (basically NIN itself and mastermind supreme) progressed NIN into a much heavier, angrier sound. Much more raw. Songs such as &quot;Wish&quot; and &quot;Happiness and Slavery&quot; are instant classics, and lest we forget one of the hidden tracks, &quot;Suck&quot;, which is actually a cover of a song Trent originally did with a band by the name of Pigface and if you don't know them you've really been living under a rock and I do not know what to tell you. But yes, &quot;Broken&quot; is an instant masterpiece, 8 song, 33 minutes, awesome album no matter how short it is.
B000002NJS|5.0|I've been a really, really huge fan of the Queen of Pop - Madonna, since I was 5 years old, and I think she was at her best level during Ray of Light times! This album is undeniably, unquestionably her most magnificent ever.<br />1) Drowned World - An awesome opener. 9.5/10<br />2) Swim - The biggest crime in Madonna's career - She didn't release this one as a single! Great lyrics, great music, the third best on the album. 10/10<br />3) Ray of Light - Such an energetic song. I love it! 10/10<br />4) Candy Perfume Girl - It's kina weird, but still nice tolisten to. 9.5/10<br />5) Skin - Amazing dance tunes. 10/10<br />6) Nothing Really Matters - I love the words. 10/10<br />7) Sky Fits Heaven - THE BEST SONG! 100% perfect. Madonna's voiceon this song is just BEAUTIFUL!<br />8) Ashtangi - Though I'm a Muslim, I enjoy this Sanskrit song.Wonderful rhytms. 10/10<br />9) Frozen - A haunted song. 10/10<br />10) The Power of Goodbye - One of her finest ballads. You shouldn't skip this! 10/10<br />11) To Have And Not To Hold - Second best song. 10/10<br />12) Little Star - Obviously dedicated to her daughter. Reminds me of her 89's Dear Jessie. 9.5/10<br />13) Mer Girl - A song about a soul. 10/10<br />Buy this album now, you won't be dissapointed. It's better than Like A Prayer and Erotica.
B0000584V3|5.0|Blackwater Park was my first Opeth *album* (having only heard snippets of Morningrise before).<br />A small point of interest - the chief criticism here seems to be band's insistence on employing growl vocals.<BR>Like many, I found this practice aberrant, and frankly disruptive to otherwise excellent music.<br />Repeated listenings to Blackwater totally changed my view on the matter - I realised that far from being the lamely overaggressive screaming of an otherwise talentless vocalist, the profound and multifaceted artistry in this volume would simply not be able to be communicated without the tool of harsh vocals.<br />They are not used for their own sake, nor to simply stop the gaps of an incomplete band lineup, but are just another component in a seamless tapestry of such potent beauty and majesty there is insufficient time in most our lives to listen and appreciate all it has to offer, let alone to just bask in incandescent admirative glow one ends up helplessly projecting on repeated listenings of Opeth.<br />Regardless, as you will discover in any of the acoustic or dynamically constrasted tracks such as &quot;Harvest&quot; or &quot;The Drapery Falls&quot;, singer Mikael Akerfeldt's talent, ability and range is accomplished, to be more than modest.<br />I suppose the fact that there are only SEVEN reviews of the odd hundred-and-fifty-three before this that are negative, and half of these are from people that could not lay aside a dislike of growling enough to appreciate the album should let you know that this may be the biggest hurdle for someone considering picking this up<br />The other 3 were either just plain wrong in their assumptions - anyone who questions Opeth's musicianship or compositional talents can be safely and objectively sidelined as a cook: As whether you find them boring and prententiously irrelevant, or pray to them daily at nightfall , their technical talents cannot be queried by anyone with even an ounce of musical knowhow - or else provided no clear logic to their heresy.<br />Buy this album if you one of those who considers music to be *anything* more than a diversion used when performing menial chores or long distance driving.  Even if -it takes you a year to come to appreciate what it is, any rational person will eventually come to at least respect this masterwork.
B00006CXXU|5.0|With Christina's new image and CD up and running she has made it clear that her Genie in a bottle days are in the grave and that the new artist X-Tina is the new and ironicly improved Christina. This CD is jamed packed with raw emotion that deals with everything and not just the over uses and over played subject of love. This CD deserves monstorus props for its amazing transiton from the pop teen days to the mature serious and more dedicated down to earth  artist that isnt afraid to show a little past and skin while being &quot;Stripped&quot; to the soul and loving every min. of it. Christina visits the past with musical diversity, with subjects of backstabers,lost innocents and survival and most of all inner strength which makes up just about the entire CD. This CD is nothing but a classic and amazing transiton from a bubbel gum pop only diva to a musicaly diveres artist. This CD is nothing but the best of Christina Aguilera.
0684833395|5.0|How to start? Virtually any praise that I can heap upon Catch-22 has been done - and more eloquently than I can ever put it. From a humanistic standpoint it is a far-reaching work touching on subjects which can be deemed universal, even given the extreme circumstances placed upon the characters; though most of us have never even smelled the smokey aroma of a bullet fired at our heads, let alone experienced the horror of war (as far-removed, history-channel watching observers like my self so inadequately put it), Heller smashes, with remarkable insight, care and an almost scary gift for paradoxical logic, into subjects which touch any person with the right-minded patience to plough through this massive novel.<br />As a work of philosophy (yes, philosophy), Catch-22 visits realms of logic that will twist the reader's mind while making him realize the idiosyncracies in war, indeed in everyday life. There is a reason why the term 'Catch-22' is now a commonly used expression; the book puts a name on a set of logical impasses that had been hinted at before but never officially named. (perhaps by philosophers, yes, but never in such a popular way)<br />As a work of literature, this book is simply amazing. A testament to the nearly 10 years Heller plunked down into its writing, Catch-22 is easily the most complex and convoluted novel I have ever read which still manages to keep some semblance of sense and cohesiveness. I cannot even begin to imagine the intense plotting and forethought that has gone into its execution; moments hinted at briefly which seem absolutely meaningless resurface 300 pages later and shed new light on everything up to that point. It of course follows suit that this novel needs more than one reading, indeed, needs more than two.<br />Catch-22 is an extremely important work of art, not only for the generation it was written for, but for humanity as a whole, for its complexity, unabashed humanity, trenchant humor (even all these years later), mad geniusand the sheer pleasure it provides in revisiting (the second lecture is much better than the first.)<br />It is difficult to expound on Heller's genius for having writen this gem within the confines of 1000 words or less, and I usually take with healthy suspicion such raving reviews as I myself have given, but it is duly deserving. If I had to compress Catch-22 into a word, it would be 'timeless'. This novel, I am sure, will be read, appreciated and admired in 50, 100 years from now, far after the echoes of the war it was set in have faded from the failing memory of our species.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Well then, you are a member of the targeted demographic.  The liberal media commends you for your gullable ways.  They are very pleased that, even though music like this has been done by Zepelin, Dylan, Beefheart, Zappa, and numerous other REAL innovators, you still are a tool to their ploys.  Do you not realize how insipid, dull, and uncreative this band is? Can you not see the extreme lack in diversity in their sound? You have bought into the hype.  Whats the difference between &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; and &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot;? Very little, thats for sure. You enjoy this because it carries the image of 'underground-groundbreaking-innovative-avant garde&quot; but the truth is it is only 'monotonous-trite-dull-talentless-and very very image-driven'. Thank you America, you've prooved that you're idiocy once again. You have bumper stickers reading 'Bush is an Idiot' and Elephant in your CD player.  You are tools, clones, under the impression that you are original.  Perhaps you should listen to Nirvana a little closer next time.They really had an original formula going.
0345448898|3.0|Okay I have just finished re-reading these books and have decided to add another review with a new rating.    I gave this trilogy 3 stars because whilst the first two books are excellent the 3rd book is terrible. It is a morass of plot holes so large, ocean liners could get lost in it. It seemed that Pullman completely ignored writing a decent story just so he could get to his 'message'    1.In Ci'gazze we are told that spectres attack any adult, it happens to the witches hunting Lyra yet when Mrs Coulter turns up, they leave her alone and not just alone, they follow her orders. We are not told why this happens, except some allusion to Mrs Coulter's force of will. Then Mary Malone manages to walk from the spectre haunted city and up the mountains without being bothered once. So too does the assassin priest. If you are going to come up with a set up like this, use it or at least explain why it's suddenly not working.    2, Mrs Coulter sudden transformation into mother of the year. Why? No actual reason save that Pullman wanted her and Azriel to sacrifice themselves for Lyra.     3. Lyra and Will being told that sex is nice. Well forgive me if I'm wrong, but sex is part of human nature and no one needs to 'tell' you about sexual feelings. They just happen. The most you need to know is how babies are made. No one needs someone else to tell you to suddenly feel attracted to people. Given how much was made of Lyra's choice, I thought it'd be something ground shattering and not whether she should fall in love with Will. It also felt false and forced. Also for those who insist that it's about their first kiss and not sex, at one point it is mentioned that they are lovers. That's a phrase used to describe people who have had sex not just a snog.    4. Mary Malone's reasons for not being a christian. Sorry but given her words about how good a christian she was, it does not follow that she would lose her faith, simply because she wanted to have sex. She would have stopped being a nun, but why would she suddenly lose a deep faith just like that. Seemed lazy and unbelievable.    5. How does Azriel manage to build up this 'rebellion against god' in a matter of weeks. Because that's how long it feels. If it were supposed to be set over a year, then okay, but that's not the timeframe and it makes no sense.    6. So what was the effect of Azriel splitting open the heavens? None apparently apart from global devastation on Lyra's world. But if there were so many doorways to other worlds, why did he have to split open the heavens. Not explained, made no sense.    7. Will's father. How did he become a shaman? Not explained, he just is and we have to accept it. Yet Will and Lyra can't be full witches with magic, so how could his father have power?    These are just the glaring holes in the plot that I picked up and possibly why I hated the series the first time I read it. My advice, read the first two books and make up what happens next, it's bound to be better than the book on it's own.
B000002KEV|5.0|If Ian Gillan isn't the greatest Rock &amp; Roll singer of all time, then I'll eat my Made in Japan LP, cassette, 8-track, Reel and CD.  Simply the best, no one else comes close, don't argue with me, enuff said, end of story!!!!!
B00005JM0B|1.0|NO LINDA HAMILTON AND NO ORIGINAL DIRECTOR.  THE NEW DIRECTOR CREATED A MORE UPGRADED VERSION OF THE BAD TERMINATOR IN THE TX, BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ARNOLD WITH NO UPGRADE.  ON THE CONTRARY, WE SEE HOW OLD HE IS GETTING AND NO NEW TRICKS.  ALSO, THIS MOVIE RUINED THE FIRST TWO TERMINATORS BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAT BY ALTERING THE PRESENT, WE CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE.  BUT, NO MATTER HOW JAMES CAMERON TRIED TO STOP THE END OF THE WORLD, THIS NEW DIRECTOR ACTUALLY DESTROYED IT.  LASTLY, LINDA HAMILTON DIED OF LEUKEMIA YEAH RIGHT JAJAJAJA AND THE TERMINATRIX IS GOING AFTER THE GENERALS AND NOT AGAINST THE SAVIOR JOHN CONNOR YEAH RIGHT JAJAJAJA THIS MOVIE WAS A COMEDY RUINED THE LEGACY OF THE TERMINATOR IS LIKE SEEING ROCKY 6, WHICH WOULD NOT BE A SURPRISE IN THIS CRAPPY HOLLYWOOD GOLD DIGGERS
B000002IRL|5.0|As people who know how to appreciate good music, we have a responsibility to thank bands such as Overkill for staying true to their roots, for maturing but at the same time not forsaking the style which has been their bread and butter for many years.  That being said, I would like to thank Overkill for making an unbelievable record which is, dare I say it, even better than the spectacular &quot;Years of Decay&quot;.<br />By the way, just as Wrathchild America covered &quot;I Ain't Drunk..&quot; in 3-D, Overkill does an outstanding job covering the Edgar Winter Group's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; on Horrorscope.  It's amazing how these bands can introduce thrashier elements into an otherwise distinctly different genre.<br />Ability always speaks louder than hype.  Unfortunately, the ignorant 13-year-olds are lost in the refuse (Korn, Limp Bisquick, Sum41, Creed, Nickelback) that MTV sells them.  They simply have no idea what they are missing, it's sad...
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This album is great and very well put together with many catchy tunes and rhythms. Those who hate this album and judge it based on its content and its artists are just down-right STUPID and NAIVE. These girls worked hard on making their albums and they deserve all the good credit for it. This album is worth every penny so if you don't currently own this album...purchase one here or at any music store within your location!! =)
B00009TB5G|5.0|I enjoyed this film as much or more as the first in the trilogy. Admittedly, it does not follow the Tolkien novels precisely. *shrugs* That is to be expected. Rarely does Hollywood go word for word, scene by exact scene. I was prepared for this and went into the theater fulling expecting some changes and the like. This is a surpassingly wonderful movie.<br /> I enjoyed it immensely. Drama, action, romance, suspense, what more can you ask for? Brilliant characters, fine acting, and wonderful scenery make for a thrill to the senses. I am waiting on baited breath for the third installment. =)
B000005ALP|4.0|I am attracted by their lack of energy.  Everything seems to be so light, especially the soft drum and the singer that never pushes his voice.<br />Sometimes they just become too much lullaby and it is getting so... boring like in &quot;Beautiful freak&quot;, &quot;Flower&quot; and &quot;Spunky&quot;.<br />On the other side, beautiful &quot;Mental&quot; could have gone really mental.  For sure, I am attracted by the harder songs of this album like &quot;Novacaine&quot;,&quot;Not ready yet&quot;, &quot;Rag to rags&quot; and &quot;My beloved monster&quot;.  But I also like song like &quot;Guest list&quot; and &quot;Your lucky day in hell&quot; mainly for the beat of the drum.
B00005B36H|5.0|TOOL, known for their beautiful but angst ridden first three albums, Opiate, Undertow, and Aenima, returns to strataspheric form with Lateralus, a spiritual and artistic journey into the human condition. Like Nine Inch Nails' masterpiece, the Fragile, Lateralus took a long time to record. The music is far more intense than their previous works. this album takes a more psyhological turn, making it more deep in its meaning, basically, the meaning of being human.I really cannot think of another band that that has as much of a deep meaning in their lyrics as TOOL.  <br />For most music fans this would be an acquired taste. for those who fully apreciate art like myself, this album is for you.
B00005JKZV|4.0|I'm a huge fan of these movies and of the books, which I'd read several times before Peter Jackson adapted them to film. The Two Towers is a great film in its own right, but I do take issue with some of the liberties Jackson took in bringing this from novel to script. Of course some liberties need to be granted - after all, the elements that make a book a masterpiece are usually the same elements that make a film terrible. But in my opinion Jackson crossed the line in more than one area where he didn't need to.<br />First, Faramir. His character is completely different than Tolkien intended. Tolkien likened him to a wizard in his wisdom and actions. In the book, Faramir seizes Frodo and intuitively knows he carries the ring. He is never tempted to take it from him and understands immediately the consequences of possessing it. He is in every way, shape and form the opposite of his greedy, power hungry brother, Boromir, who tried to steal the ring in the first film. I think that making Faramir struggle as he does in Jackson's Two Towers dramatically takes away from the character's brilliance and only turns him into a cheap plot device to stall up Frodo's quest instead of letting us witness wisdom and selflessness at its finest.<br />Second, the Ents. These giant trees are supposed to be the wisest of all things living, as Tolkien intended. In his books they arrive at the conclusion that they must go to war for all living things are affected by it. However, Jackson has them decide to abandon Middle-Earth and only after being tricked by the hobbits Merry and Pippen do they decide to fight, and then it's for the selfish reasons of seeing their own kind hurt by Saruman. Again it's my opinion that Jackson cheapens a character and turns them into a lame Hollywood plot device.<br />Lastly, the Elves. Tolkien has them abandon Middle-Earth except for Elrond's sons. Jackson sends an entire army of Elves to aid at Helm's Deep. This was a huge liberty to allow Jackson, since it entirely changes the character and motivation of the Elves.<br />There are many fine points to the film, not least of all Gollum. The blend of CGI and reality make for a one-of-a kind character. The performances are great from all the cast, but I do think that Eowyn was the weakest of the bunch casting-wise. She doesn't even really compare to Liv Tyler and it's not very believable that there would be a love triangle between her, Arwyn and Aragorn.<br />Finally, the music was better than the first film, and I must say it was the first film's biggest weakness. The main title sounded like something I'd expect to hear on ESPN's Baseball Tonight. Very generic melodies. They should've gotten a bigger name to handle the scoring. <br />All in all, it's a great movie of course, but with more blatant flaws than its predecessor. The pace never feels quite right, since we are cutting incessantly from lengthy dialogue scenes between the Ents and the Hobbits to action packed battle sequences at Helm's deep. The film also ends somewhat abruptly. Most of us were expecting to see a spider. I'm sure Jackson had his reasons, but to me it didn't feel right.<br />I'd have to say I was disappointed in this, especially after how amazing the first one was. But of course, I'll be first in line to see Return of the Kind this December.
B000060P79|5.0|No Pads..No Helmets..Just Balls..the name speaks for itself. This cd is a refreshing album with a fun, care free sound that is perfect for listening to anywhere. The songs best describe today's youth as they are angry and rebelious..this album makes being a kid a little more tolerable. A fun cd! Simple PLan are the real deal..definitely check them out!
B00005MAM2|1.0|akira this anime movie is not the greatest thing i've ever seen in fact it's probably one of the most confusing i've seen. i'll start with the story which is my biggest problem with the movie because it makes no sense why certain things happen they seem to just happen and for no reason and no explanation as to why they happened. the characters do all kinds of random things as well that you never understand why they act the way they do like when one of the main characters start going on a killing spree or those weird people that look like kids with powers that pop up outa nowhere start trying to stop the guy killing everyone and you never understand why those things happen. it's not like i have only seen the movie once i'm a huge anime fan and wanted to know why people liked it but everyone i asked to explain the movie couldn't they just liked it because it was the popular thing to do. i had a pretty big problem with the animation with the characters and their weird lips and mouths other than that it was ok as far as the rest of the animation was concerned. my other gripe with the story was what akira was because they never really explained what it ment or did i've seen this movie 4 times and still don't like it or understand it it might be because i didn't read the mangas if that's true then i just don't care and will continue to spread the word that AKIRA [is bad]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and for those of you that disagree well you just don't want to admit it's lame and are therefore lame yourself :P<BR>oh and by the way for thos eof you docking points because of the new \\"versions\\" of the english dub THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE GET OVER IT there never was a difference i've seen the original and the new versions they are the same neither made more sense than the other so stop writing about those things cause it isn't true the movie sucks accept it
B0000C9V3T|5.0|This is one weird soundtrack but before I go into that I need to reassure you that &quot;yes&quot; the fantastic music including the &quot;stings&quot; from the trailers is on this disc. It's called &quot;Battle without Honor or Humanity&quot; by Tomoyasu Hotei. I've watched the teaser trailer numerous times just for this music.<br />  The mix goes from the dulcet tones of Nancy Sinatra and Meizo Kaji to a 'man with no name' whistle in the wilderness Ennio Morricone to some unnecessary profanity from track 5.<br />  Most of the music is fun but one of the best parts of the disc apart from the above mentioned track 9 are the 3 previews.<br />  Buy it!  It's well worth the money.
630521610X|5.0|I just wanted to write a review about this movie<BR>telling everybody this is a really good scary<BR>movie! I bought it on DVD awhile back, and I love this <BR>movie!!! It has everything in it, that you need to know<BR>about a scary movie like on how to survive in a scary<BR>movie and such. And the DVD has some AWESOME stuff on it!<BR>Like behind the scenes, showing how they<BR>made the movie and other cool stuff! Well I reccommend you buy this movie, if you don't have it already! It totally kicks butt!!! <br />P.S.<BR>I am ready to buy Scream 2 and 3! ;-)
B0000AXE8I|5.0|OK, all of you out there who say Reloaded was horrible are definately wrong.  This movie had so many amazing special effects, and twists and turns it made the movie that much better.  Scenes such as the freeway chase were unbelievable.  Sure there were some parts in it that were a little corny, like how the Merovingian's wife wanted a kiss from Neo in exchange for taking them to the keymaker. But oh well.<BR>The only thing that I did not like in Reloaded was the whole Trinity/Neo part (you know what I mean).  If it weren't for that it would have probably have been better than the first.<BR>For all of you out there who say that the movie was missing something (other than an end) you are right.  I thought the same thing after I saw it. The way to answer a lot of the questions is to watch the Animatrix, but especially play Enter the Matrix. Enter the Matrix answers a ton of questions about Reloaded, and it gives you additional information as to what is going on in 'the real world'. Oh, and at the end there is a preview for Revolutions that is probably 2-3 minutes long. Just play the game.<BR>Reloaded was awsome, I don't care what anyone says. I hope Revolutions will be even better.<br />Remember... Free your mind.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes sound hasn't changed, and that's a good thing.  With the release of their second album comes fast strumming guitars, the familiar infectious melodies and the sometimes-nonsense lyrics of Julian Casablancas.  Their first ballad, \\"Under Control\\" brings a summery feel with major chords and simple lyrics, yet there is still the feel of The Strokes' meticulous beats that creates such a \\"together\\" sound.  Their first single, \\"12:51\\" brings the familiar fast strumming chords of Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr., with a new twist: 80's hand claps.  On \\"The End Has No End\\" The Strokes reveal a metal sound in the start, which quickly turns into a mellow rock and once again the metal, accompanied by Fab's drum-box-like beats and Julian screaming into the mic.  Overall The Strokes sophmore album is a perfect 10, and well worth the wait.

B00009RDG9|2.0|\\"The hunted\\" is, so far, the worst film of 2003 that I have watched. There are so many flaws, so many wrong things; I'm amazed that a multi-million dollar budget like this one has such a poor script, edition, direction and even casting. Three actors I consider excellent - Tommy Lee Jones, Benicio del Toro and Connie Nielsen - deliver in \\"The hunted\\" the worst acting of their careers - well, in fact Tommy Lee was worse in \\"MIB II\\", but this is a close call.<br />Del Toro is simply awful as the ex-black-ops soldier who sees horrors while in action in Bosnia, and then suddenly snaps and begins a murder spree in Oregon and Washington State woods. But other than watching one single scene where he's troubled by nightmares, there's no explanation of why he turns into a wild murderer. Tommy Lee Jones is summoned by the FBI to help hunt del Toro down, because the older one was the former killing insttructor of the younger one. What's laughable is that Tommy Lee's character prides himself of never having killing anyone, and that's a little hard to believe about someone who is considered one of the best about teaching other people to kill. The chasing scenes are terrible. Del Toro is always ahead, and manages to loose Jones' pursuit. But then Jones, who surely must have been created by a fox, or a leopard, just snifs the air, or sees a foot print on a lawn, and is back on the track again. Pitiful. Connie Nielsen's character is completely neutral, and clearly just a beautiful face to go against del Toro's dark, disheveled looks (and those black marks under his eyes get bigger each movie) and Tommy Lee Jones' scraggy gray beard. I don't remember any of the other characters. But it doesn't matter. The prize question is, why do these award-winner actors agree to be part of such a bad movie?<br />Psychological level is zip. And that is very strange, because the director, William Friedkin, is responsible, back in the 70s, for what I consider to be one of the best psychological thrillers of all time, \\"The exorcist\\". But in \\"The hunted\\" it's just plain action and chasing scenes. Most of them are good ones, but some aspects are ridiculous. For an example, Jones' character gets a spike buried deep in his thigh, then he takes it out and manages to continue his pursuit without even limping. Ha-ha. I know this is fiction, but there's a limit to everything. This is to show the script was poorly and amateurishly done. And the trailer is misleading. In it, most of the scenes shown are in the woods, trying to re-create a \\"Rambo\\" atmosphere, but in fact most of the movie has the city of Portland as background.<br />Movie studios: don't treat your viewers as idiotic people. In the end, it will backfire on you.<br />Stay away from \\"The hunted\\"; it isn't worth the admitance or rental price.<br />Grade 4.0/10 - the woods locations were nice.llers of all time, \\"The exorcist\\".

0385720920|4.0|This book was filled with some of the most despicable characters and outlandish situations I have ever come across. And I loved it so much I could not put it down. Palahniuk definitely has a unique narrative style, and it is very addictive. It is not very often that I actually laugh out loud while reading, but this book was an exception--particularly the scene where he is trying to help a member of Sexaholics Anonymous act out her rape fantasy (trust me, it's a whole lot funnier than it sounds). <br />Basically, if you are in the mood for a good, entertaining, albeit dark and twisted book, you can't go wrong with this one.
1400049628|4.0|The word parody is thrown around alot with this book but I tend to look on it more as a satire that sits way to close to the truth. The truth being the survivalist movement. I found it to be more of a satire of the survivalists and it rings very true after the Y2K hullaballoo. The zombies are thrown in just to have something to survive. This is a funny book but don't expect huge belly laughs. Truth be told, when the zombies do rise, this book may prove valuable. (Tongue firmly planted in cheek.)
B00005ATQD|4.0|For some reason, I am really in the minority among all my friends on this one, who just did not seem to appreciate this movie. Of course, most of them complained about the same thing: the piano hammering the same note throughout. They obviously don't understand Kubrick's use of music to create a feeling for the film. He was much more concerned with the story and the film itself than trying to collaborate with the record companies to get Christina Aguilera's latest bubble gum hit in the film so that he and they could make some money on the soundtrack. The piano did an excellent job of creating the tense and haunting background so that we could be more in touch with the characters and what they were going through mentally.<br />That being said, I found this to be a very good movie. I never once thought the story dragged, and as far as there being no payoff at the end, that's just a part of human nature to get all worked up about something that turns out to be nothing of any significance. Shame on more movie for not trying this approach, rather than reproducing the same cookie cutter Hollywood endings.<br />Is it Kubrick's best film? I don't think so. Would I even put it in his top 5? Actually, no. But a sub-par Kubrick film still has more substance than 95% of anything else out there, so just enjoy it for what it is.
B00004TJTS|3.0|This is definitely a family movie, or at least a movie for dog lovers, of which yours truly is one.  I have to admit I don't like Muniz; he's totally over-acting in every role he's graced, this one especially.  Luke Wilson's character is so forgettable, I don't know why he's in the movie.  Kevin Bacon is totally not believable as a stern father.  Diane Lane (the reason I picked up the movie) gives a good performance, but seems too old next to Bacon.  (Sorry, Diane!)  And seriously, she's too sexy to be a southern housewife.<br />The plot, like someone mentioned before, is rather conventionally and forced.  There isn't really a nice central story.  The ending is pretty much predictable.<br />What made me enjoy the movie, inevitably, is the dog character Skip (short for Skipper).  The terrier is just so adorable!  The credit screen says two dogs play the character, one puppy and the other adult.  Both are just terrific animal actors.  They have the ability to project a lot of dog personality, and the filmmakers did a great job capturing the best moments of these unforgettable dogs.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I was very reluctant to buy any White Stripes cds because it's hard for me to get into any of the new artist out there but after I played Elephants I was blown away at what a great musician &amp; writer Jack White is.<BR>1.Seven Nation Army-is simply one of the greatest rock songs of all time.Guitar,guitar and more guitar!Has an excellent bass build up before the electric guitar rips into what will likely be one of the most memorable guitar riffs of all time.An instant classic rocker with a wicked solo.<BR>2.Black Math-is a repetetive track with a bit of punk to it.<BR>3.There's No Home For You Here-is a mid temp track with scorching guitar.<BR>4.I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself-has a great hook.Jack does a great Beatlesqe cover of this song that starts off with a slow calm tempo then turns into a rocker.Great vocal performance by Jack.One of the best of the album.<BR>5.In the Cold,Cold,Night-slower tempo jazzy flavored tune with Meg on vocals.Whoah she plays drums and sings!<BR>6.I Want to Be the Boy to Warm Your Mother's Heart-piano driven slower tune wth a very nice slide guitar solo.<BR>7.You've Got Her Hand in Your Pocket-nice ballad with only one acoustic guitar in it.<BR>8.Ball and Biscuit-bluesy guitar track that kicks in with high pitched guitar riffs screaming at about the 2 minute mark.<BR>9.The Hardest Button to Button-very catchy rocker.One of the best White Stripes songs with a cool build up.Was a great choice for a single.Cool drum backup beats.<BR>10.Little Acorns-Heavy guitar rocker.One of the heavier White Stripes tracks ever.Awesome song!Riffs,riffs and more cool riffs.<BR>11.Hypnotize-another great 60's era style rocker.Short but with a great hook and a bit reminisent of Fell in Love With the Girl.<BR>12.The Air Near My Fingers-Cool mid tempo track.Could be another single.<BR>13.Girl,You Have No Faith in Medicine-Fast paced garage rocker.<BR>14.Well It's True That We Love One Another-Three's company on this one.This fantastic album ends on a bit of a comedic note.<BR>All in all one of the best rock albums in the last 5 years or so.White Stripes continue to keep classic rock fused with a bit of blues,jazz,folk and punk alive.<BR>And to all those few sorry souls out there who went out of there way to write negative reviews about Elephant 2-3 times each....Get a life!
B000005IU2|1.0|Before I wrote this, I thought I'd actually re-listen to &quot;Fun House&quot; 3 times while driving, and in different moods. Then I read all 80+ reviews on Amazon of it.  Too funny. &quot;The greatest rock'n'roll CD of all time,&quot; &quot;More soul than 'James Brown at the Apollo'&quot;, &quot;THE prototype to all punk records that followed&quot; (maybe closer to the truth).  I'd bet that 80% of the reviewers here weren't even around back then, and they're just writing their crap after reading &quot;Please Kill Me,&quot; the punk rock bio.  As Lou Reed once said, &quot;Iggy was just a bad imitiation of Jim Morrison, who wasn't very good anyway.&quot;   Back then (I was 16 when Fun House was released) the Stones were the real deal, as anybody who knew anything knew. The Stooges were a good time local band you could actually get tickets to, and when you were sloppy drunk, did a few qualudes, and couldn't get laid, they were a good substitute for the Stones. But listen to &quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot; from Beggar's Banquet, or &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; and THEN listen to &quot;LA Blues&quot; or &quot;TV Eye&quot; from Fun House and compare.  No comparison.  Even &quot;Goin Home&quot; by Ten Years After, &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; by Blue Cheer, or &quot;Rock Me&quot; by Steppenwolf makes the Stooge's &quot;LA Blues&quot; just boring white noise.  And Arthur Brown's &quot;Fire&quot; was probably very influental on (and better done) than anything on Fun House. The nihilistic white drone was better done by Paul McCartney (of all people) on the Beatles &quot;Helter Skelter.&quot;  And Them's &quot;Gloria&quot; and the Velvet Underground's &quot;Waiting for the Man&quot; wipes the floor with the 3 chord groove of &quot;Down on the Street.&quot;   Too bad most of you aren't even familiar with these tracks that came out BEFORE Fun House, or even the Stooge's first LP.  Truth hurts, doesn't it?
B000001FN3|5.0|I had never listened to an Alan Parsons record - so I will be the first to admit that I cannot make grandiose statements about his work.  However, I found the record at a junk store for a dollar, and placed it on my turntable when I got home. I only bought it because I am a big Poe fan, and thought a musical interpretation would be amusing.  <BR>From the opening notes of &quot;Fall of the House of Usher&quot; I admit I was absolutely spellbound. The album: hypnotic, emotional and lush. For the time it was made, the sounds were so incredibly innovative. I found huge inspiration in writing my own music after listening to this album over and over! It is both tearfully sad, and delicately sinister. I was moved emotionally as I sat through it. Absolutely gorgeous album - I kid you not.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Started to read these reviews, and .....ugghh.  Obviously written by 15 year olds who think the CD cover is actually what was released back in '68, and don't understand the 2003 geriatric stadium playing wrinkled rockers could once play the blues. Anyway, ........  What makes the Stones different than simply being the &quot;original Aerosmith&quot; is the fact that they could not only aspire to be huge pop/rock stars like their friends the Beatles, but they could play the blues and therefore become old touring musicians one day.  Steven Tyler and Joe Perry have their roots in the Stones, Yardbirds and Led Zepplin, while Mick Jagger and Keith Richards have their roots in Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and Howlin' Wolf.  Get it?  On their 1969 tour, they actually sat on stools for part of the show, played acoustic blues numbers like &quot;No Expectations,&quot; &quot;Parachute Woman,&quot; and &quot;Love in Vain.&quot;  If Jagger had a brain, that's what the 2003 Stones would be doing, and doing better than anyone.  &quot;You don't need to shout, or leap about&quot; sang Ringo Starr in '72, and 60-year old Jagger doesn't need to run around a stadium stage singing &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash&quot; or &quot;Satisfaction.&quot;  Keith knows the Stones could very well become 75 year old white bluesmen on their stools doing Muddy's &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; or even their own &quot;Stray Cat Blues.&quot;  The '68-'69 Stones of Beggar's Banquet and Let it Bleed were the best Stones in my opinion. Listen to this music, and dig it.

B00008H2LB|1.0|Apparently, it falls to me to reveal the sad truth about this album.  It's a sheep in wolf's clothing.  The reality is Linkin Park is a band which belongs to the worst genre of all (yes, worse than country): nu-metal, also known as poser-metal.  What makes this genre worse than all others you say?  Well, it's the fact that it masquerades as something good.  It fools people into thinking that it's &quot;hard&quot;, or &quot;tough&quot;, or even &quot;music&quot;.  The basis of real music is emotion, and the only emotion this album exhibits is worship of the almighty dollar.  Even worse than that, this album tricks the minds of impressionable, young, and mostly pre-adolescent boys into thinking this is what metal really is.  Hoo boy, if there is an unpardonable sin, Linkin Park have condemned themselves to the lowest circle of Hell.  Linkin Park is more concerned with producing music that appeals to the ear, is easy to listen to, and is essentially unchallenging to the mind.  This is the kind of music that appeals to the average person, who is very stupid.  This is why horrible poser-metal bands have any success in the first place.  If you want to listen to something that won't make you think, won't make an impression on you, and won't change you at all, then this is the shlock for you.  If, as I am hoping, this has changed your mind about poser-metal, then check out bands such as Megadeth, Pantera, Metallica (before the black album), and Slayer.  If you like what you hear, check out Relapse Records, they have probably the best selection of hardcore, metalcore, sludgecore, and just about any other kind of &quot;core&quot; music you can think of.  And this does not, in any way, include Slipknot.  If you feel insulted by this review, go ahead, prove your devotion to corporate rock, and give me negative feedback.  But at the very least, download it instead, so you won't be directly putting money into the greedy band's pocket.
B000089RVX|5.0|Maybe I'm too old for &quot;goth rock&quot;.  I'm not generally into the whole goth scene and all that.  But, if you ignore the videos and just listen to the music, it rocks.  Great new band.
6305972591|2.0|I just got threw watching this movie.  It was boring from begining to end.  There wasen't awhole lot of good scene's in this movie, the only decent scene was at the begining...
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm a hip-hop lover, 1st of all. But, I borrowed &quot;Stripped&quot; from a friend, for one reason or another. I listened to &quot;Fighter&quot; and &quot;Walk Away&quot; and I was just hooked. I decided to get the cd for myself, and ended up listening to the cd over and over again. &quot;Stripped&quot; is one of the few Cd's I have that I can listen the whole way through and not get bored. Which is strange seeing as I have Eminem and Christina in the same collection. The songs I recommend most are:<BR>Walk Away<br />Fighter<BR>Loving Me 4 Me<BR>Underappreciated<BR>Get Mine Get Yours (I know...I know!)<BR>Dirrty
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|first off, i was completely blown away with avenged sevenfolds first album, sounding the 7th trumpet. and i bought waking the fallen the first day it came out. i started listening to it and i got mega chills though myself when Shadows first sings out &quot;ill try, she said and he walked away...&quot; just....wow. after listening to the whole thing, practically in tears, i would not put my cd player down. best band ever, best cd EVER. just to sum it up :). if u dont go buy it, ur CRAZY!!!!! go buy it, right now. best...EVER. and the length of it, i actually thought it was too short! i cant get enough of a7x! :) :D
B000066NW0|2.0|I heard &quot;Complicated&quot; and liked it, so I bought the CD. That was a foolish move - I like a total of 2 songs on the whole album. &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot;. I don't get why people say that &quot;Sk8r Boi&quot; is the most punk(est?) song on the album, it's something totally opposite of what I think of as punk. I could have easily burned those 2 songs from one of my friend's cds. I never listen to &quot;Let Go&quot; anymore. It's collecting dust on my shelf. I could have used my money to buy the new Christina Aguilera cd (which I eventually did) instead. (I bought &quot;Let Go&quot; in September 2002.) I wouldn't recommend spending money on this.
B00005JLWN|5.0|A very good SCIFI movie with a good plot and great actors. I liked it.
B00008RH1H|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of Shakespeare or Kurosawa's samurai tales should check this one out. It's an adaption of Hamlet, set in 16th century Japan. It has all the same elements that Hamlet had, just in a samurai setting.<br />Toshiro Mifune is great as the Hamlet character, Taketoki Washizu, who starts as a loyal servant of King Kuniharu Tsuzuki, played by Takamuru Sazaki. Many of the same actors who were in The Seven Samurai were also in this movie, such as Mifune, Takashi Shimura, and Minoru Chiaki. Yet the movie isn't as great as Seven Samurai. It's still quite good, with Mifune in an excellent role. The movie has a very eerie feel, especially when Washizu sees the witch 2 times. Also, the music is quite evil sounding too, what with that squeaking whistle. Anyway, it's another great movie by Kurosawa. Worth watching.
B00005YW4H|5.0|The 1990's quality of music was bad, but the new century has brought out the worst of the worst in musicians.  But there are some solid artists out there with an eye on quality - despite their genre.  This album restores your faith in the music industry and is worth purchasing for all the songs.  Smooth vocals over touching tunes - simply wonderful.  See some of these other quality reviews for the music, but take my word about the quality of Norah Jones and her understanding of the art of music.
B00000JPH6|3.0|Very Fascinating movie.  I saw this movie for the first time when I was a child and it scared the life out of me...I decided to watch it again just recently.  The movie has a high entertainment value but I think the audience that it was geared for(I believe the youth)it is too much for.  I wouldn't recommend this for a young child...maybe a child 12-15 might enjoy this but I don't believe it's for anyone under 10.  Overall it is a pretty good picture but I'd keep it away from the likes of looney tunes and care bears.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|&quot;Scarface&quot; is an incredible film about the rise and fall of a Cuban refugee in Miami, FL in the early 1980s.<br />This film revolves around Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who came to this country when Fidel Castro expelled many of this citizens (and criminals) to the United States in 1980. Tony and his friends soon discover the world of cocaine and begin selling it. Tony builds an empire out of this business and eventually becomes a very powerful man. However, all of the power soon comes to an end when a hit is placed on him. The climactic scene at the end (containing the now famous line, &quot;say hello to my little friend!&quot; will leave you in awe!<br />Al Pacino gives what I believe is an Oscar-worthy performance as Tony Montana, while the very young Michelle Pfeiffer portrays his cocaine-addicted wife. The film can quite violent at times and very strong language is used often, so you might want to put the kids to bed before watching this one.<br />The second disc containing all of the special features is a gem within itself. It contains deleted scenes, how the film came to fruition, and a short documentary about how &quot;Scarface&quot; has influenced many of the hip-hop artists today.<br />Overall, I would give this film and its special features 10 stars. Even though Tony chose to go into the business of cocaine, it shows how a person coming from virtually nothing can become one of the most power people in the country if his or her drive is strong enough. Like the movie says, &quot;The world is yours!&quot; I would highly recommend this film to anyone with a DVD player. It's a film that I think everyone should see at least once in their lives, whether you're into gangster films or not. You will not be disappointed at all!!! Watch this film!!!!!
B00000G42T|5.0|Among this two disc set is one clunker, and that is I WANT YOUR SEX (PT. 2).  It turns me off because it's just the backside of the monster hit that played itself to death.  I didn't check out the &quot;Pt. 2&quot; part.  Aside from that, this is still the best of George.  From funky jam solo, duets with Elton John and Aretha Franklin, and the best part-the ballads, George made his mark on the music world, and whether you agree or not, his versatility as a performer is his best asset.  Listening to some of these tunes, it becomes obvious that he could have made a bundle in the contemporary jazz catagory.  Any two-hit wonder can put out a &quot;Best of&quot; disc, but George Michael has done himself a great service by releasing a very impressive body of work.
1400034779|5.0|This splendid little book tells us how Precious Ramotswe, who has inherited some money from her father, uses it to set up a detective agency, armed with a manuel on how to be a detective and a secretary she does not need but thinks it important to be seen to have. It is quite episodic, midway between a set of short stories - detailing Precious various cases, checking the credentials of a suspect long lost father, investigating a suspect claim for an industrial injury, determining the fate of a missing husband, tailing an overprotective father's teenage daughter, figuring out why a doctor at the local hospital is sometimes so good and sometimes so bad - and a novel, united by the characters of Precious, her relationship with Mr J. L. B. Maketoni (a very close friend but we are never told a what his first name is) and an investigation over a missing boy which runs through most of the book. <br />The book differs from a conventional detective story in many ways. For one thing there is no murder and most of the cases Precious investigates are fairly minor undramatic affairs, only rarely involving any serious crime at all - exactly the sort of cases such a person who most likely spend most of her time on in real life. For another it is set in Botswana, not a country the genre has made much of hitherto. And it is a joy to read, most particularly for the characters of Precious - terrified of snakes, utterly unfazed by lawyers and gangsters - and Mr J. L. B. Maketoni, the bachelor  mechanic who is smitten with her. It must be nice for the author that his books come up first under \\"most popular results [of 32000!] for Smith\\" but it's a success this book very honourably earns.

037571412X|4.0|I have to say The Dying Animal broke no real new ground in the \\"Lolita\\" genre, and in typical Roth fashion, nothing really happens in the book, as he pretty much tells the story in first person past tense as if he were on a couch talking to a shrink. In short, he breaks every rule writers are advised to follow and the result is exactly what The New York Review of Books hails \\"A Disturbing Masterpiece.\\" It is a perfect example of why I bypass the best seller table at any bookstore I patronize.<br />It is an ugly story about a pathetic character and yet, because of Roth's ability to tell a story, I found myself unable to look away, and when I closed the cover for the last time I found myself unable to refrain from thinking about the book and how it left me feeling, and it made for quite a discussion with my girlfriend, to whom I'd read aloud several passages and who'd scanned the book cover to cover herself. Is it any wonder Roth has won just about every writing award, including the Pulitzer?
B00009V7PJ|1.0|I went to the CHER Farewell Tour Sat. Oct.4th 2003. I sure am glad it was a farewell tour because I wouldnt pay $5.00 to ever see her again. This was the WORST concert I have ever been to. Thank God I have been to other concerts, if it had been my first concert it would've been my last. Sure am happy to know she will be off stage soon FOREVER and make room for people who deserve the fans everywhere and they won't waste their money on CHER anymore ever!!!!!!!!!!!
1400049628|5.0|Despite a few inconsistencies, this is the finest book on zombie survival ever written.  Perhaps the best advice is not to trust what you've learned from Hollywood movies.  From personal experience, I've learned it's never safe to barricade yourself in the basement.  The author presents a great deal of scientific evidence relating to the cause of the zombie menace and various efforts to counteract it.  Before reading this book, I was not aware that any serious research had been conducted on the cause of the zombie phenomenon.  Parts of the book are just plain impractical.  I don't believe the zombie threat is serious enough to warrant building a 10 foot high brick wall with steel reinforcement and a sliding metal door around my house and I cannot presently afford to tear down my house and re-build it in the manner of the tornado proof houses in other parts of the country.  I also noted one glaring contradiction, the author urges the reader to obey all local, state and federal laws yet makes several references to using silencers on firearms.  It's my understanding that silencers are currently against the law in my country.  Also, no mention is made of the silencer's effect on skull penetrating power of the bullet.  Again, I'm not familiar with silencers, but I believe, at the very least, they affect the range of the bullets. <BR>     This book is highly recommended to ALL.  It's easy to laugh now but you won't be laughing when the zombies come to your door.
7119005901|5.0|probably the most popular novel in china , vietnam , japan,korean...... this is a wonderful book , maybe the greatest book i have ever known.<BR>Seeing  some reviews said that Liu Bei is the main hero of the novel ,in China we disliked and considered him a man who know nothing but cry and a demagogue . the  most fascinating character must be Cao Cao , the translation missed some quotes of him , and even the famous seven battle of Kong Ming with the barbarian ,of which he captured the rebel's leader ,realesed him ,and then recaptured.....<BR>Even with the best translator there are still some  poems, words.... that seem impossible to translate into<BR> english , if you know chinese try to buy this book in chinese.
0066214122|5.0|This is one pf the best books I have ever read. I have read all of Michael Crichton's fiction novels and this is by far the best. I started reading one day and I literally did not put it down until I was done. Great action, excellent scientific background and explanations. The changes in the characters were strong. They are believable and very real. It almost seemed like I knew them in reality. This book can be genuinely scary at many times. I can't wait to see the movie when it comes out. What happens to some of the characters and the events of the book seriously stayed in my mind for days, and when a book gets you thinking like that, you know it's good. The ending seemed quite a bit tragic to me, but I guess that was one of the many tools Crichton uses to show the possible effects of this emergent technology. All in all, a very compelling and thrilling novel, possibly the best I've read in a long time.
B00008O0WN|2.0|The art and music of this movie are really objectionable. The bridge is very cluttered and old-fashioned looking, clearly infected by &quot;Enterprise&quot; art concepts, leading one to believe that the technology of Picard's time has actually gone backward! I love &quot;Enterprise&quot; for what it is: a nostalgic look at the old days. But completely inappropriate to let the art direction of that series have such influence here.<br />The music in the beginning is cheaply melodramatic and really grates.<br />The overall effect is one of a show that has sacrificed the smooth, high-tech appearance that we have come to know as &quot;Next Gen&quot; in favor of an appearance that was out-of-date when Kirk was alive. Bad move.<br />The plot is inherently good, but poorly executed. Both the location of the final battle and the way it ends lack meaning. Having said that, the battle itself is quite interesting. Also, the lines given to the Romulan commander at the end of this movie are so inappropriately saccharine and phony as to defy belief.<br />It is also both true and sad that, as another reviewer noted, the ending of this movie completely invalidates the ending of the TV series, which ending was a vastly superior piece of work.<br />Final conclusion: go ahead and buy it for the extras, but the movie will disappoint. Too much &quot;Enterprise&quot;, not enough &quot;Next Gen&quot;.
B00007G207|3.0|I watched both versions.  The new, updated version is much better... still a sad story, but if you are into that.... you'll like this movie about personal loss and lost love.
B0000028PL|4.0|In support of their groundbreaking debut, 'Vivid', Living Colour ended up opening for the Rolling Stones' arena tour in 1989.  With the same style, artwork, and producer, they appeared again with 'Time's Up' in 1990.  But between their second record and 'Stain' in 1993 would come the grunge movement, which was in many ways threatening on a band whose halmark was embracing varyious musical styles.<br />The good news is that, musically speaking, Living Colour refused to follow the trend.  The bad news is that this record was left underappreciated by alternative radio.<br />In many ways, 'Stain' is a departure from the previous two records - in fact, bassist Muzz Skillings had been replaced by Doug Wimbish, producer Ed Stasium had been replaced by Ron St. Germain, and the bright pop art of the first two records had been replaced by a stark image of an imprisoned woman-child.  Even Corey Glover had cut his locks.<br />Taking a page from the Metallica/Bob Rock playbook, the production is very clean and the guitars are in your face.  Most of the tracks can be characterized as unmemorable hard rock (&quot;Ignorance is Bliss&quot;, &quot;Wall&quot;) or punk (&quot;This Little Pig&quot;, &quot;Mind Your Own Busines&quot;), with just a few dashes of sonic experimentation that seems a little forced (&quot;WTFF&quot;, &quot;Hemp&quot;).  Nonetheless, there are a few standouts that make this record worthy of 3 1/2 stars - the beautifully orchestrated &quot;Nothingness&quot;, the tongue-in-cheek novelty tune &quot;Bi&quot;, and the hard-driving to-the-point single &quot;Auslander&quot;.<br />I do not think that Living Colour can make a bad record.  In the end, however, there is nothing particularly ahead of its time on 'Stain'.  Still, the record does not deserve the commercial obscurity caused simply by bad timing.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I keep thinking this sounds so much like a mutation of T. Rex - instead of the psychedlic/glam thing, we hear blues/punk.  The first time I listened to the White Stripes, I had a wild surge up my spine similar to when I first heard Nirvana; they have related sounds - razored down and raw, which makes sense because they share a similar musical pipeline.  <br />The brand of rock 'n roll here is very visceral,  sometimes sensitive, intensely energetic and just plain cooks without apologies.  Good enough.  Much better than the bucket loads of the rubbish that's been in circulation over the past few years.   <br />Another reviewer denounced the band as sell out material and pandering to the tastes of blank Americans?  Maybe. They're damn fine sounding sell-outs & manage to walk along some interesting fences.   LITTLE ACORNS is one of my favorite tracks off this one, followed closely by Girl you have no faith in medicine, ball and biscuit & the AIR NEAR MY FINGERS.   And so now that they've enjoyed some success after kicking around a few years, interesting to see where they go.  The White Stripes are a band I think I could still be enjoying a long time from now.<br />As a side note: some of the b-sides and rare tracks out there are fantastic & hopefully we'll get a collection of them in the future?
0446608955|4.0|This book was one of the most touching stories I have ever read so far.  In the beginning it was sort of tiring but in the 4th or 5th chapter it got really interesting.  I thought that it would be another love story like usual until Landon finds out she is going to die and he helps her fulfill her list of things to do before she passes away.  But my personal favorite part was right before the end when the two get married.  I thought it was the most touching part of the book.
B000099T2L|4.0|I bought Beyonce's cd after hearing baby boy, because i really liked that song, Crazy in Love was getting overplayed, and i wanted to hear another song, before i went and bought it. I really like the cd. Of course everyone likes Crazy In Love, but Naughty Girl is a good song, she took a couple of lines from Donna Summer for that one. Baby Boy is great, i like Sean Paul on the song. But my new fav. song is absolutely the title song. Dangerously in Love, it's a great love song, and she sings beautifully on it. I love the chorus, it's a feel good song. I like this Cd, way better than Mary J. Blige's new cd.....
B00004U8P9|5.0|First time viewers beware! This is an audience participation movie.  To sit quietly in a room and watch it as you would a normal DVD is to do little justice to a movie that had midnight audiences dancing in the aisles throughout the 80's.  But, if you are looking for a strange and mischievous theme for a party then there is nothing better than to have your friends dress the parts and dance to the Time Warp again!<br />Shades of Warhol and other B-movie horrors of the past abound, as Rocky Horror draws from everything and anything to bring you into its realm.  It flopped in its first cinema release, but thankfully was revived as a midnight movie classic and now verges on its 30th anniversary. Hard to believe.  Susan Sarandon never looked so good.  Neither did Tim Curry.  This DVD is handsomely packaged and destined to be a collector's item. It not only contains the original movie but numerous out-takes, sing-alongs and other clips to give you an even fuller Rocky Horror experience.  It is sexy, outrageous and so cornball that unless you are as nerdy as Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick never looked so good) you can't helped but be carried along by its feel-good spirit. Even Brad submits to the charm of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the end.
B000092T6M|1.0|I'm not one to launch gratuitous slams of Kevin Costner and I've enjoyed most of his stuff but this movie takes 'interminable' to new dimensions.  I can't begin to imagine why anyone would want to make it even longer as it is one of the most insufferably boring movies I've ever seen.
B000089RVR|4.0|I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that there has been no real change in her style, but this album was great to listen to on headphones while doing things around the house.  The songs are definitely growing on me, and like the first album, I can see myself reaching for this recording for years to come just because of her voice, the lyrics and the music.  They are all so complimentary and real.  Definitely a should-get for 2003!
B000099T2L|1.0|One good song doesn't make a cd.  Turn it off after track 1.
B00005JM1F|3.0|i love WILL FERRELL but this movie was just a hop, skip and a jump away from being horrible. there were some funny scenes in the movie but a lot of the parts just dragged and were boring. i'm glad i got it and will watch it again but the average person who isn't a fan of any of the cast members will probably be bored out of their minds with this movie. numerous scenes like snoop doggy dogg's performance or when some young chick tried to put the moves on bernard just seemed to drag out way too long. it's one of those movies that makes you wonder things like why a pointless scene was included and why it didn't get left on the cutting room floor. then you're watching this movie and suffering through the boredom feeling unentertained because you're waiting for the few good scenes to wake you up. overall this movie would fail to entertain the common movie goer. like i said unless your a big fan of WILL FERRELL or you have some other reason for buying this movie you should probably pass.
B000089RVR|5.0|SIMPLY...ONE OF THE MOST BEATIFUL ALBUMS OF THE YEAR...!!!!
B00009UW0N|5.0|Of all the horror films, the first Halloween is probably the best &quot;edge of your seat&quot; film. It's more believable than your usual horror film and doesn't need to be super gory to be scary.  Others in the Halloween series don't fair as well but the original is hard to beat.
B0000AMRJC|3.0|After owning the original DVD &quot;special&quot; edition, I was suckered into buying the new &quot;anniversary&quot; edition with DTS surround sound.  What a disapointment!  This has to be the worst display of DTS surround sound I have heard.  I did not even try the Dolby Digital 5.1 version.  There really is no sound improvement from the original.  Very hollow sounding throughout, no real bass, or involving surround scenes.  The only slight improvement was is the soundtrack.  The hotel bathroom chainsaw scene was so uninvloving that I turned the movie off in disgust.  If you already have this DVD, don't waste your money.  If you really feel obligated to buy it for the &quot;extras&quot; that you most likely will never watch, be my guest.  Rated 3 stars only for movie content.
B00005JLSE|1.0|PLain and simple, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!  Except for Cathine Zeta Jones this movie should have been lost at sea, with cement overshoes!  A waste of money no matter how you look at it, go watch Moulin Rouge again you will be happier!!!!
B000000IUK|5.0|In a sea of watered down kiddie pop and even more diluted &quot;hair metal&quot; this album stands as the pinnacle to a very fruitful and successful career for U2.  Every artist at that time wished they could have sounded like this and many bands afterwards have tried.  <BR>The enhanced sound of the gold cd is noticeable, but I would have to say that just owning the &quot;regular&quot; cd in your collection would complete it.  If you don't have it, get it.  Now.
0811729117|5.0|I would highly recommend this title to those interested in a honest account of East front combat.  Even though it recounts the tale from the perspective of the tiger, which has become very overdone recently, the author is very witty and describes the war from the beginning in his 38t.  For the paper back novel, you will not be disappointed.
0790737345|5.0|First I did not see Wings of Desire, the film that COA is based on.  Let me add that I am glad I did not because many of the negative reviews here are based upon a comparison of the two, and I would not have wanted any comparison of that sort to subtract one iota from how deeply I was affected by this truly beautiful film.  Everything about it is so well done, the music, the imagery, the photography, the editing. And then there's Meg Ryan's performance--WOW!  Her best, no doubt in my mind.  Ryan's beauty has never risen above the \\"irrisitibly cute\\" level in my mind, but the photography, and lighting are so spot-on that she looks gorgeous in some scenes, so much so it hurts your heart to look at her.   Dennis Franz is superb, and Cage does what he has to to make this film work, which means he is both etheral and understated.  The limited range he displays in this film is in service to the larger story.   Please take note of the detail in this film, the wonderful performances of the lesser roles:  Ryan's friend Ann (Robin Bartlett), for one, and the two women( Deirdre O'Connell and Kim Murphy) who Ryan has to inform that their loved-one has died on the OR table. These two women are probably on screen for all of 45 seconds, but their performances are so on the mark, so creative, as to make them indelibly memorable because of their originality.  I find myself watching that scene over and over. <br />Silberling(sp?), the director, has it all under control, and the editor certainly knows how to cut a movie. <br />Having said all these great things, let me say that the ending did not work for me, not because it wasn't as happy as it could be, but because it seemed contrived, not well thought out, and the performances fell a little flat at this time. Even so, even with an ending that disappoints, the film is worth seeing, and then seeing again.  Buy it, rent it, borrow it, but see it.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Most of the reviews I read seemed born of frustration with an admittedly not-perfect sequel to the Matrix. The product isn't out yet, but I had to think hard about why I would pre-order or wouldn't pre-order a movie I both enjoyed and found dissatisfying. Some reviews here paralleled my ambiguity; others seemed to be tantrums of disappointment.<br />So here is why I think I will wait to buy Reloaded.<br />The first movie was a lot of fun. The first half was rather slow and built a foundation for the latter half, keeping you interested just with the hints of weirdness and suspense about 'the truth.' The second half carried the subject of the background and completed the mythical creation of a hero. <br />Cool. The Matrix, as far as I'm concerned, is a satisfying stand-alone experience.<br />As I understand it from following fan-sites, etc., is that there is only one sequel movie, split into two parts, Reloaded and Revolutions. <br />Reloaded, like the first half of the Matrix, provides backstory. Action exists to keep that portion of the audience is not interested in complex, intricate plots but rather were hooked on the Matrix by the over the top action of the first movie.<br />So from Reloaded I got some satisfying, though some unsatisfying, background. Not of the hero-to-be, Neo, but the war into which he as thrown as flag-bearer and champion. After all, the Iliad doesn't start at the walls of Troy; Reloaded starts far enough before the machines reach the walls of Zion to explain background but still remaining fairly close to the climactic battle.<br />For example: is the Matrix a virtual reality within true reality? or is it a virtual reality within another virtual reality? Will I see Revolutions and realize that the apparent cliffhanger in Reloaded was no cliffhanger at all, but instead that all the 'secrets' of part 3 were already hinted at in Reloaded?<br />Sure, Morpheus' speech isn't as good as the St. Crispin's day speech, or Bluto's Germans Bombing Pearl Harbor rally speech. The 100 Agent Smith fight was too much, maybe, and nothing new, but then the freeway chase was a thrill. Trinity doesn't turn all guys on, but hey, we got Monica Belluci and others but the girls only get Keanu and Fishburne (guys got the better deal, in my opinion).<br />Lots of people in these reviews rant about the shoes, but hey, try to make yourself a pair of shoes from stuff you have around the house that won't wear out or fall apart quickly. The glimpses we get of Zion would suggest that Zion doesn't have big leathery cows or alligators to kill for shoes or rubber plantations for the soles, and probably they have the same machines and probably hydroponics factories to spread the same resources thinner over a growing population.<br />Anyway, when I noticed small details like an absence of shoes, my mind filled in details; watching the movie was more interactive than most 'action flicks.' Friends of mine who enjoy a more passive movie experience on the whole disliked the Matrix.<br />Ok, so I overall enjoyed Reloaded. Then why not buy it?<BR>Because it's the first half of part two. If Revolutions proves Reloaded to be a big head-fake, or deflates my expectations set after watching Reloaded, then I won't buy it. I'd rather be content with the first Matrix as a self-contained hero creation story, and forget a forgettable 'hero goes to war' sequel in two parts. <br />I hope after Revolutions I'll be avidly going back over Matrix and Reloaded to look for clues that foreshadowed the revelations in Revolutions, but I will wait until November to decide.
0783225849|5.0|Anthony Perkins defines Norman Bates, and this movie is miles ahead of the remake.  Many words have been written about the movie and plot, so I will address the extras.  The production notes, which are broken into chapters gives tremendous background information on how the movie was created, directed, written and acted. In context, this movie was made during heavy censorship, wherein the seal of approval was necessary for the film to be shown.  How this was dealt with provides much fascinating commentary.  This was the first movie to show an actual toilet in a bathroom!  The word tranvestite caused the censors a problem until it was shown they really didn't know what the word was -- it just sounded naughty!  And oh so much commentary about the shower scene, which still stands the test of time.  The commentary is almost as long as the movie itself.  This movie belongs in any serious movie buffs collection.  The print is good, although initially there are some streaks and blemishes in the titles, but that disappears once the movie starts.  And how many knew there was a connection of the movie and Star Wars?  Buy the DVD and find out that connection.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is her own artist. she writes music that she can say relates to how she really feels. thats what it sounds like when she sings. she does'nt write the music people want to hear, she writes wants she wants the public to hear. Avril Lavigne uses her induviduality to do her best at what she wants her life to be. i respect that.
B00003CX9Q|1.0|How can they do this?!!  THIS IS A CRIME AGAINST MAN!!!  I imagine that you're wondering what I'm SO angry  about.  If you don't know, Mr. Spielberg went back and changed the policeman's shot-guns with walky talkys for the DvD release.  Why, you may ask, is this such a big deal?  Well then just imagine Indiana Jones swinging across a ravine filled with cottonballs using a candycane.  Imagine the shark in &quot;Jaws&quot; spitting candy at it's victims before carrying them off to timeout.  Imagine the D-Day invasion with troops armed with walky talkys and blood replaced with Jello.  That's what will happen if we condone this kind of thing.  Don't by this DvD.
B00005JMNY|4.0|For those of us who aren't old enough to have remembered the real club kids....there is PARTY MONSTER..  Macauley Culkin returns to the big screen as Michael Alig and I assure you there are no \\"home alone\\" references in my mind now when I think of him.  He pulls off scared, cracked, tough, psuedo-confident, AND bisexual REALLY WELL.  I read Clubland over the summer (UHM, I think I was on the James St. James schedule for making it thru a page! LOL)...which is a Village Voice reporter's account of the rise and fall of Clubland ala Peter Gatien and the clubkids.  PARTY MONSTER is based on James St. James' Disco Bloodbath (which is my next must read)....ANYWAY, The movie doesn't gloss over too much- it's really about Michael Alig - even though it's told from his famously jealous best friend and original clubkid- St. James....Peter Gatien's roll is diminished as well-  though in reality it's pretty academic and filled with legal blah blah and would have detracted from the story of these clubkids who are quoted as \\"famous for trying to be famous\\".  It seemed 99% of the audience knew someone like everyone in the movie...I was eerily intrigued by the whole movie-  just the ability of these clubbers to literally make something huge out of nothing.... The word fabulous was used a million times...and NOT one time did I hear the word BUMP.  Not a shocker since they seemed to snort a \\"bag\\" or do a \\"rail\\" all the time....so, the must not have had much use for the word- bump.  What's also fascinating about this movie is that these kids were very aware of what they were feeling- even cracked.  They did go on a huge binge after the crime- obviously, they stole all Angel's stash....and then it seems everything about the gruesome ending DID come out of a disassociation with reality.    I HIGHLY recommend this movie for the \\"support the indies!\\" factor AND b/c it's entertaining- it's ACTUALLY peppered with a lot of comic relief.... I give it 5 WANDS b/c it's an interesting TRUE story (though only part of it) and it's a great \\"go with your friends\\" movie.... and the soundtrack has made me come home and download STACEY Q!!  :-) <br />I'm not a critic- but if you've ever experienced \\"club life\\" you know how the serious party bois and girls are...and this cast was right on...in a way, it didn't look like they were even acting...though I'm sure they didn't pass around a mirror and razorblade while filming....hmmmm
B00006ZCFH|4.0|First of all, it's not about age...it's about appreciation of all music. I am 21 and I proudly embrace the true soul and funk that has influenced the contemporary hip hop we are hearing everyday. Nothing against the &quot;music&quot; that is topping the charts, but I was just awaiting something new to provide an escape from the same old sound. No surprise, Ms. Badu delivered. <br />I have been supporting this queen since Baduizm and will hold on tight as she continues. It may not be on the level of Mama's Gun, but HELLO??! That album is on a level all by itself! I don't believe in expectations, but with each try Erykah comes with the sound I never knew I was missing. I saw her in concert in Orlando, and I cannot WAIT to see her again! Go get this EP!! <BR>Personal favorite: &quot;I Want You&quot;<br />Listen, concentrate, absorb!
0783240236|4.0|The movie remains a classic and even more so when one considers it was made before the computer and digital work that is commonplace in movies now.  Hitchcook was a master of presenting images and the editing and music add much to the scenes.  With this new release, I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the transfer.  There are blemishes throughout and the picture seems less than pristine.  I doubt this is a restoration copy.  In fact, one of the background pieces in the extras seems in sharper color than the movie.  However, this does not take away the fact that this movies stands the test of time as a wonderful suspenseful movie by a master craftsman.    Released as a new DVD the same time as Psycho, this has fewer bells and whistles.  But, it still is a gripping and greatly visual movie with a truly chilling ending.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|This commentary by a reviewer below is totally absurd. So, a so called REAL fan must swallow any junk a band records? Gimme a break...<br />Yes, I do respect the new sound of Iron Maiden, a muddled sound created apparently by Kevin Shirley, where the instruments simply do not shine,they are kind of blurred, unlike in the times of Martin Birch as producer.<br />But, as far as the songs goes, they are really different, but extremely good, better than the crap being recorded recently and massively exposed through radio and MTV. And why are they good? Because Maiden can play, Maiden can compose (well, I have some restrictions about Janick Gers´s ability, but...), Maiden has a clear focus established since the start by his founding member, Mr. Steve Harris.<br />Two tracks will stand the test of time in Maiden´s discography, I guess: PASCHENDALE and DANCE OF DEATH. They are essential Maiden. I just loved those two songs, even with the bad production.
B00006RU5B|5.0|In todays repeative mainstream pop, punk and &quot;Rap&quot; rock, audioslave is the true music fans savior. <br />There has not been a good music group out after the 90's faded away leaving us all lost and confused in the music world.  Our only hope was in waiting patiently for the next Radiohead or Tool CD to come out.  No band has stepped out from the garage to make it big and it took the remembrance of two great bands to pull us out from the sharp decline in rock music.  <br />With rock taking a beating with wannab's such as Creed, Linkin Park, and Incubus putting out over produced and over rated albums, Audioslave gets back to what music is really all about.  <br />Great song writing, real guitar solos, and modern beats, ranks this album among the best.  Chris Cornell has by far one of the all time greatest voices in rock.  Combine that with the intriquing sounds and pure talent of Tom and the rest of rage, how can you miss? <br />Cochise, shadow of the sun, what your are, bring em back alive, and like a stone are my top 5 for the album.  (Even though every song is amazing.) SO, if you are one of those people who just skip to there favorite song, for once, just let the CD play, you won't be disappointed.  There are hints of Soundgarden, and there are flashes of Rage here and there in some songs, but together Audioslave evolved the best of both bands. <br />This album will be remembered as the best thing to come out since the 90's grundge era.  If you have any taste or interest for great rock music, you owe it to yourself to go out and buy this album.
B000089CJI|5.0|I woke up one morning after being asleep for 2 hours with Postal Service blaring throughout the room. I had never heard it before but I immediately fell in love with them...!
B000089RVR|4.0|I was very excited to buy this cd after hearing the hit single, White Flag. But after listening the whole cd, I am a little bit disappointed. Dido's voice is good, no question about that, but it sounds monotonous from the second song to the last. The lyrics are also quite similar, being left by someone. I wonder what song will be the next single. But like the other listeners have said, it took time to grow on you. Yes, I am beginning to enjoy it somehow. Who knows, it will be one of my can't-lend-to-you cds.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|good work Ms. Badu you always change it up.... and I digs it...<BR>Dont listen to what them critics say keep doing what you want to do with your music.... and for the record Mamas Gun was off the hook!!!!!!!!!!!! your best album in my eyes.... This album should be added to your collection if your a true music lover its different and thats why its good.... Do your thang girl!<br />HE2SEXY@AOL.COM.......... EMAIL ME IF YOUR FEELING THE ALBUM
B0000C7PSW|5.0|This CD is simply breathtaking.  It's so emotional and Rufus demonstrates such range on this album.  The hurt you hear in his lyrics, and the background behind the recording of this album make this a &quot;must have&quot; CD for 2003.  <br />I really loved the intro for the album and the song &quot;Beautiful Child&quot;.  However, the whole CD is tight and has so much depth.  Rufus has unbelievable talent and the skies the limit for him.<br />Order this from Amazon today!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|This album is simply one of my all-time favorites.  While &quot;Poses&quot; and Rufus's early albums had wonderful moments (and definitely a less orchestrated feel), this one takes him in a new direction, taking his unique voice and compelling lyrics and adding beautiful and complex arrangements of horns, orchestra, and vocal harmonies interwoven with a rich musical heritage that really sets Rufus apart as an artist and musician - you'll hear references to everything from Bolero to Queen, bossa nova to blues .<br />Some other reviewers are not comfortable with this move; others needed time to really get into it.  For me one listen was all it took.  These songs are still about Rufus trying to understand a complicated world - as we all are.  Everything about this album is  reminiscent of a phoenix rising from the ashes and soaring into new heights of musicality. Given Rufus's personal struggles and recent emergence from rehab, it's not surprising.
B000063WDH|5.0|The Black Keys should by present in ever music lover's collection. For those into music that makes you want to rock, music that makes you want to roll, and music that you just want to listen to regardless of what mood you are in because it is good, I can't yell at you enough for not owning this CD that IS medium fidelity to it's finest. Everyone who listens to this fuzzed-out album will instantly become fans of this band. Rock n' Roll, baby!
B000002KHB|5.0|Machine Head is, to date, Deep Purple's best album.  Machine Head is probably one of the best albums to come out of the 70s. Influential in the formation of hard rock and heavy metal, Machine Head consists of 6 unique songs.  &quot;Highway Star&quot; is a fast-paced opener, in contrast with the more mellow, but more disturbing &quot;Maybe I'm a Leo.&quot;  While &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; is most likely the favored song by many Purple fans, the true premier song is &quot;Lazy.&quot;  Long and moody, it features the best effort of both Blackmore and Lord.  &quot;Space Truckin',&quot; like &quot;Highway Star&quot; is fast paced, making one feel as if they had left off where they began, eager to listen again and again, reliving the joy of Machine Head's journey.  If you are eager to explore the influential albums of the 70s, definitely BEGIN here.
B0000025KI|5.0|I really don't think I have enough good words for &quot;The River&quot; and I know that a maximum of 1,000 words cannot possible be enough for the epic I could write about this album! What I will say is that this is probably the only album in my CD collection that just gives me an instant good feeling when I listen to it. Even if the song is beautifully depressing like Bruce does wonderfully, it still feels me with sheer delight. In my opinion, this IS what an album should be--two discs of pure mastery. &quot;The River&quot; is so perfect that I couldn't rate the songs if I wanted to--every single one would get 5 stars. My favorite, though, would have to be &quot;Stolen Car&quot; (if I HAD to choose). It is just so painstakingly brilliant, solemn, and it exemplifies the quiet desperation that I love from Bruce...gorgeous in one word. I love everything I can get my hands on from Bruce Springsteen, but &quot;The River&quot; just flows through my veins. How about that corny plug, eh?
B00000ILDF|4.0|Now the alien creature lands upon a prison planet and kills some of the inmates, accordingly instilling terror in all the others.  The prisoners and visitor Ripley then determine to kill the creature.  <br />Killing the creature, you see, is the only way to eliminate the threat and end the terror.  The really puzzling thing is this: All but Ripley were prison inmates, and convicts overwhelmingly come from social/family settings wherein everyone is a Democrat.  But these prisoners decided to act unilaterally, in cowboy fashion, against this terrorizing creature.  They did not seek U.N. approval, or allow more time for inspection, or attempt to form any sort of coalition.  At no point did they ask, \\"Why does the creature hate us?\\"  Their decision to simply kill the terrorist, before it could kill any more of them, was definitly not diverse, compassionate, inclusive or tolerant -- it was simply the action they needed to take, to completely neutralize the alien threat.  They didn't behave in the least like they wanted to reach out to this terrible creature, and show some compassion, inclusion and diversity.  VERY puzzling!
B00008O31H|5.0|The Black Keys just plain rock. They are similar to the White Stripes, yet The Black Keys can actually play their instruments. Rock was meant to have this much emotion. You can pop in this CD and listen to it all the way through in your car rockin' away at the fuzzy unclean greasy rock/blues creations that these two geniuses have created. Any musician, especially guitarists, will be inspired to turn on their amp and rock away. I first heard thickfreakness and was amazed that what I was hearing wasn't an old rock &amp; roll recording. I encourage all of you who want rock/blues/good music to buy this!
0156027321|5.0|This book was wonderful. I loved the character development and the pace of the book. It really makes you think and reconsider the whole cast of characters at the end. Great read. Don't miss this one.
B00005JLK1|2.0|SSSSSSSSUCKED!  The first scenes were ok, and some of the hazards they met in the ship were cool, but I reeeally wish I had just gotten drunk and passed out in a park somewhere with my money instead...
B000089RVR|5.0|I think this cd is even better than her first one!  Her unique voice draws you into the music.  I like every one of the songs except for Who Makes You Feel ( #7 ). This is a good cd to buy!
B00006LLLN|5.0|This album is the best of the best when it comes to bluegrass these days.  Alison's vocal and instrumental talent is only magnified (if that is possible) by the current line up of Union Station.  Jerry Douglas is THE BEST DOBRO PLAYER to ever walk the face of the earth.  You have got to get this album!
0789723107|5.0|This is hands down the finest, best written, easiest read book I have seen/read regarding web design.  Great buy, worth every penny.  I highly recommend this book.  Reading this book would have saved me several years of trial and error on my own.
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido has excelled.  Clearly the most beautiful album released in the 21st Century to date.<br />'White Flag' is only a teaser to the rest of the album.  'See the Sun' leaves you wanting more and more.  <br />Well Done Dido!
B00005JM0B|3.0|Arnold finally returns as the Terminator on a mission to save a \\"squemish\\" John Connor (Nick Stahl), and a few others including Claire Daines (far more impressive performance than Stahl's). Cameron didn't return to direct or co-write this inferior \\"sequel\\" to T2: Judgement Day and it showed. Kristanna Loken as the TX was a great idea but her performance (nothing wrong with her at all--just didn't think any woman could really portray this role like Robert Patrick flawlessly did) was flawed by allowing her to be so easily damaged and relied too heavily on CGI effects. Robert Patrick's performance in T2: Judgement Day was far more impressive: he lacked all emotion, acted human only when needed to, and was brutally ruthless. Loken was brutally ruthless but didn't evoke the fear Robert Patrick's Terminator did. Also, for $170 million dollars, couldn't they come up with some better action? T2 was far superior in this regard, and James Cameron only spent $90 million on it. The cool stunts just weren't there and nether was the great character development (Linda Hamilton wasn't invited to the party and killed off strangely). Claire Danes gave the best performance and Loken attempted greatly to pull off the Terminatrix role (some better writing for her character probably would have done it). Action missing: T2's Patrick flying out of an exploding building to take over a chopper, the ensuing chase scene involving the chopper, and the great scene of the Truck exploding through the concrete rail, and Arnold launching his motorcylce off the (well, you get the idea). Also missing was the cool transformations he did into others and how they reacted. Why not show Loken doing that more (or even once for that matter)? Also, a better plot would have made it better. Compared to the first two, T3 failed to rise in character development (Stahl was a geeky Connor with none of the brew of Edward Furlong in T2), action and stunts, and, of course, blowing the opportunity to make the TX a really cool compliment to a superior Robert Patrick's evil charcterization. Again, not Loken's fault, it was the screenwriter's fault. It is worth a watch but fans of the original two will notice all the missing elements that made the first two great (on much, much smaller budgets). -Felecia Constance Rowe
B00006IUNN|4.0|I've been on Saipan.  The terrain is lush jungle surrounded by the clearest ocean I've ever seen.  The water was so clear you could see the crabs scuttling on the bottom fifty feet down.  The last time I was there was 55 years ago, on my way back to CLUSA after two years in China and on Guam, also in the Marianas.<br /><br />This was a good movie.  It centered around our Navajo code-talkers, which we used in WWII in the Islands.  Talking in their own language, they confounded the Japanese code breakers, and were quite effective.<br /><br />That's about where the realism ends in this movie.  It's true that the bullets flew fast and furious, and that many thousands of American Marines died on the beaches and in the jungles.  Some of the scenes here were obviously shot in the American Southwest.  There was no desert on Saipan, nor on its sister island, Guam.<br /><br />The most obvious innacuracy is the depiction by Nicolas Cage of a Marine sergeant standing up in plain sight, with a Thompson submachine gun holding a 20-round magazine, firing literally hundreds of rounds, mowing down Japanese soldiers (who also have weapons in their hands)like there was no tomorrow!  Man!  With two more guys like him we wouldn't have needed a Marine Corps!  They could've taken all the islands in the Pacific by themselves.  No wonder the code-talker he was assigned to protect (unless he had to kill him, depending on circumstances) stood around with his mouth open in amazement.<br /><br />Like all of the other movies that are trying to portray what that war was like, played by actors who have never seen combat, written by writers who have never seen combat, and directed by directors who have never seen combat, it is perhaps better than should be expected.<br /><br />I think that the best film of that era was a color documentary made by the Navy called &quot;The Fighting Lady,&quot; about the U.S.S. Enterprise, showing real men flying real airplanes, many of whom were actually killed in combat.  It was a propaganda movie made during the war.  Lt. Robert Taylor, USNR (remember him?) did the voice over.<br /><br />The best fiction depicting actual warfare was The Bridges at Toko-Ri, written by Michener, who actually spent time on the flattop with the men involved.  Of course the reason I like them is because they depicted Naval Aviation, which was my bag.  The problem with The Bridges is that the movie shows our jet fighters, the F9F Panthers, hitting the bridges, whereas the actual airplanes used (yes, such a battle was really fought) were propeller driven attack planes known as ADs.<br /><br />The lead was played by the late  William Holden, and the only inaccuracies devolved around his buddy-buddy relationship with an admiral who wasn't his father, and the portrayal of his wife (Grsce Kelly) coming to Japan to be with him.  A navy Lieutenant should be so lucky!<br /><br />But that's another movie.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie that accurately depicts a ground-pounder's life in action (and yes, I've seen Saving Private Ryan) Nor do I want to.  The poor bastards.<br /><br />Of those that I have seen, this is one of the best.  It is to fact as a Western movie, with all its fast draws and gunfights is to the way it really was in the West.  How do I know how it was?  My grandmother came to Oregon on a wagon train, and I am old.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other bookskilled in combat.

0440133688|5.0|I'm goint to give you the advice nobody gave me: if you plan on being a doctor, do not read this book until you are well into your residency. Do not read it if you are in pre-med. Do not read it before your internship. This book is the most disconcerting, alarming and depressing books ever written. Shem, brilliant in the art of storytelling, creates a hospital out of hell, where basic human emotions are at loss, where nobody cares, where nobody is responsible or functioning normaly--as a doctor, as a human being. And Shem does this with such force and delivery that you can actually believe that such hellish places exist, that there's no hope or love in hospitals, just a perverted dance with death and despair.<BR>Brilliant book. Wonderful writing. Pure poison.
B000069AUI|5.0|Of all the praise one could speak of the members of Coldplay, the best may well be that they are still learning their craft.  In every way an improvement over their well-received debut album (&quot;Parachutes&quot;), what is most impressive about &quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot; is that the band is clearly still evolving, still stretching its legs to find its stride - and when it does, the result will be staggering.  Coldplay draws comparisons from some corners to Radiohead, and this evolutionary feel may be the reason, as the latter band's second album (&quot;The Bends&quot;) had the same &quot;very-good-but-the-best-is-yet-to-come&quot; vibe.<br />     Viewed on its own merits, &quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot; is an amazing work of art, that manages somehow to be both catchy and beautiful at once.  The best songs tend towards either sad and tender (&quot;Warning Sign,&quot; &quot;The Scientist&quot;) or edgy and angry (&quot;Politik,&quot; &quot;Clocks&quot;), but it is when the two are combined that the album reaches its greatest heights.  The closing track (&quot;Amsterdam&quot;) begins with soft, almost exhausted-sounding vocals that slowly grow, but never rise above a whisper, until a extended and passionate coda that comes seemingly out of nowhere and soars almost to a transcendent height... but then fades back to nothing, as though the song simply cannot bear the weight of itself any longer.  Much of the album benefits from similar subtleties; the songs are all fairly long (The shortest is just over three and a half minutes; most are longer than five) and are allowed to develop slowly and meticulously, always building but never seeming forced.  Lyricists and sound editors alike could learn a great deal from this record.<br />    Like &quot;Parachutes&quot; before it, &quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot; is a hit-or-miss record; on both albums I found that one half of the songs were much superior to the other half.  Still, it's hard to call anything a &quot;miss&quot; on an album this good; while &quot;Parachutes&quot;' good tracks are better than &quot;Rush&quot;'s lesser tracks, all of the new material is noteworthy.  It's impressive that the worst tracks on &quot;Rush&quot; are still better than the best tracks on many of its contemporaries.  I can only wait to see what they produce next.
B00000K19E|5.0|OK I am a cheerleader for my school, so I don't usually hang out with sci-fi geeks at my school, but a friend of mine was all excited because he wanted to see the Matrix reloaded. I had heard of the matrix before but wasn't sure of what it was. So I went and rented it and wow! It was awesome. It had a really great story line. It is a bout Thomas Anderson a computer hacker <BR>who meets a lady named Trinity who tells him that Agent Smith and his henchmen are trying to kill him. Then he meets Morpheus who tells him that the world that he knows is actually a dream world made by evil machines who years ago took over the world and enslaved human beings. The movie blew me away with its special effects. It also had alot of heart to it like when Trinity told Neo that she loved him I could have died crying.<BR>I can see why she fell for him. NEO IS HOT! If there is any movie worth seeing the Matrix is one of them.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|The producers of The Who's &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; final debut on DVD went all out to compose a masterpiece.<br />This is everything one would want in a DVD package.  They don't call it &quot;Special Edition&quot; for nothing!<br />1. Nice hardcover slipcase to put your DVD cover in.<br />2. A nice booklet of photos, commentary from the director and producer, and liner notes of each track.<br />3. 2 DVDs... the first containing the movie in glorious hi-def. color/B&amp;W, 5.1 surroundsound.  Also includes audio commentary by director Jeff Stein, and subtitles of where each performance comes from. <br />4. The second DVD filled with &quot;extras&quot;.  Contains a &quot;Restoration process&quot; documentary, 6 camera angles of the tracks &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;, those 2 songs with just Entwisle's bass track, 2 quizes with prizes!, hidden gems, as well as an interview with Jeff Stein, photos of the Who, and an audio/visual comparision between the VHS (old) version of TKAA and the DVD version.<br />As for the movie itself what can I say?  The ultimate rock and roll documentary.  Even if you are not a big &quot;Who&quot; fan, you can appreciate the band more by watching this documentary.  The color is superb, the sound is phenomenal for old footage.  Oh and I almost forgot, the producers restored the movie to its orignal theatrical length!<br />The perfect DVD!<br />A++ all the way.
B00005B36H|4.0|Here's how I rate:<br />5: Masterpiece.<BR>4: Must have for a collection.<BR>3: Worth the buy.<BR>2: Its listenable.<BR>1: Complete waste of time and money.<br />I didn't think all that much about this album at first. I thought they had wasted some track space with the final 3 songs (Disp, Refl, Triad - I don't count Faaip).  After more listening, I came to understand the songs better. It was obvious it was mostly written without Maynard. Then I saw them in concert. This album is AMAZING live!! You can't come to understand these songs without feeling it like that, being there.<br />Certain things like this: Parabola was probably my instant favorite off this album. I thought that it would have been one of the greatest songs EVER if they had just added an extra chorus or something instead of ending it like they did. I was irritated because I thought they ended it like they did just so it wouldn't be as radio-friendly. Spit on me for ever thinking that. The song structure isn't thought out like that, its felt. When I saw this live I understood. The energy was gone, it ended because it HAD to. <br />So now, this is one of the best albums I have. Why did I give it 4 stars then? Simply because of Ticks &amp; Leeches. Verse Chorus Verse Chorus Bridge (guitar strumming) Heavy End. Its a frigging formula. This song doesn't fit into the album. Its so negative, while the rest is positive (yes, even The Grudge . . . in a way). <br />Get this album, it will be one of the best things you have ever experienced. Better yet, pay the $40 to $60 to go see Tool when they come around again. I would pay way more than that. Friggin religious experience. In the mean time, try and understand this album and see how far off you were when you do see these songs peformed live.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|I'm a fan of Enigma (and Cretu) but I have to give this album 3 star out of 5...
B000092ZYX|5.0|I can not listen to this alnum without feeling the unconscious desire to move my hips, to dance, to keep myself in constant nervous motion.<BR>there is nothing that can compare to walking down the road listening to sit down stand up, and watching the raindrops hit the puddles in maddening rythem with the music.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I can say that it was the hour drive it took us to get to the theatre.  It's hard to believe it's been less than 2 years since the world lost such an amazing man.  And seeing all of these famous people, who were all George's best friends, there singing and making music for George was absolutely amazing.  I thought I might make it through without crying too much, but I was wrong.  If you're a respectable Beatle/George fan, you WILL cry.  Seeing Paul McCartney play with Ringo was amazing, they kept looking back at each other and you have to think about how many times Paul has looked back and seen Ringo on drums.  Paul did a great job on All Things Must Pass, and he really surprised me how he didn't demand to be in the spotlight the whole time.  Tom Petty did a GREAT version of Taxman, and the Monty Python bit was really funny, you find out why it's rated PG13 though.  I'd say the best part is the very end, everyone in the theatre was sobbing at that point.  Eric Clapton did lead on most songs, he did wonderful and as usual his guitar was just beautiful.  All in all this was a beautiful tribute to George, and a must have for anyone who's been touched by George's life.  And a note to anyone seeing it in theatres, STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS.
B000099T2L|4.0|I feel that Beyonce's first solo CD is an absolute hit!  She blends classic r&amp;b with hip-hop, soul and reggae.  There is actually only one song that I always skip over, which is &quot;Signs.&quot;<BR>Everything else is great, but the ones I play over and over again are: Be With You, Yes, Speechless, and Dangerously In Love.  Beyonce sounds more mature than I expected and it is a pleasant surprise!
1400031354|5.0|Oh my, how wonderful these little books are!  Tears of the Giraffe is just as refreshing as No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency - like a second visit with a good friend.  Light, yet not patronizing, simple, yet not condescending - just a refreshing respite from all the heavy, too-many-layered stuff out there.  I'm hooked.
B000089RVX|5.0|1. Going Under - ((9.5)) This is the newest single from them, and I absolutely love it.<br />2. Bring Me To Life - ((7.5)) I loved this song before it got overplayed by all the radio stations and video channels.<br />3. Everybody's Fool - ((8.5)) This is a different song that starts out a little slow but picks up the pace throughout.<br />4. My Immortal - ((10)) This is my favorite song by Evanescence and I get goosebumps everytime I hear it.<br />5. Haunted - ((7)) This is an alright song, but it doesn't really stick out as well as some of the other songs on this CD.<br />6. Tourniquet - ((9)) Another excellent song, I'm guessing this could be their next single.<br />7. Imaginary - ((7.5)) Another great song but doesn't stick out too much either.<br />8. Taking Over Me - ((9)) This song grows on you, or at least it did for me.<br />9. Hello - ((9.5)) One of the only other songs besides My Immortal that gives my chills.<br />10. My Last Breath - ((8.5)) An excellent song that has a very fast pace.<br />11. Whisper - ((9.5)) Another excellent song that gives me goosebumps towards the end of the song, when the heavy orchestra and background vocals kick in.<br />Overall Fallen is a great cd and I highly recommend it to people who like Gothic Rock. This is one of my favorit CDs of the year.<br />9.5 out of 10
B000002UB6|4.0|The saga of this album has been well documented.  This was recorded in early 1969 prior to Abbey Road, which was released later in the year.  By the time Let It Be was released in the Spring of 1970, the Beatles no longer existed as a functioning group, and the session tapes were given to Phil Spector.  Paul always complained about Spector's overproduction.  If John or George had issues, they did not go public with them, and as solo artists they would both work with Spector.  Well, with John and George are no longer with us (and Spector has his own issues) we now hear that Let It Be will be re-released without the Spector influence.  Could Paul be finally having the last laugh 30+ years later?  The re-issue will not contain &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; but will instead have &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; which was recorded during the same sessions.  Release date is November 17.
B000068PQ0|4.0|Having only known this group for their novelty hit, &quot;She Don't Use Jelly,&quot; I had no idea what I was in store for when I went to Harvard to party and have some herbal refreshments with a friend of mine. What I heard that night changed my life and made me run to Newbury Comics yesterday to buy this awesome CD. While it may be best enjoyed with some enhancements, it stands on its own just fine, with the help of one of the most clever songs in the history of pop music, &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1&quot; and the opening &quot;Fight Test&quot;. The hypnotizing &quot;Are You A Hypnotist??&quot; and &quot;Do you Realize??&quot; are both spellbinding and breathtaking. I won't give this CD an unrealistic (and undeserved) 5 stars but it is definitely one of the best ambient cds of the decade, if not the century).
B0000B3FCX|4.0|The first time I listened to this disc the time flew by!  It was very good.  They took a little edge off the guitar licks, a lot of edge off the vocal anger and melded in some very consistent and pleasing melodies.  The album still qualifies as a rock recording, but I think it will appeal to a more mainstream audience than their previous album.<br />Kroeger's lyrics are again stunning.  He has a great voice that's just rugged enough to deliver the song's message - damn, I wish I had his voice.  <br />I was a little disappointed that &quot;Hero&quot; from the Spiderman soundtrack wasn't included.  Afterall it was a Nickelback collaboration and would have rounded this disc out nicely.  The limited edition casing is cool, done with a tri-fold cardboard sleeve with nicely done liner notes.<br />The songs on here won't chart like the songs from &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;, but it's still worth the money you'll spend.
B00006F7S4|5.0|What a shock when I found out that Beck was behind this masterpiece of a record! Having gotten used to the slacker persona of &quot;Loser&quot; and hipster &quot;Where It's At&quot;, I was hardly prepared for the aural orgasm of &quot;Lonesome Tears&quot;. I would go as far as to say that that song alone is enough to buy the whole cd, with its majestic strings that build up to a full symphony that leaves you teary-eyed and breathless, but there is actually more good work on the album besides this one song. Check out &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; for a relentless groove and &quot;Lost Cause&quot; for the perfect breakup song of the century.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I went to a big party at a friend's house this weekend and he just bought this DVD.  I couldn't help but be antisocial because I was mesmerized by this concert!!  I saw the live concert on TV, but they polished and fine-tuned this DVD release!  <br />The costumes, staging, mixing, balancing, video and interaction are all to be goals for future concert DVDs...but I guess we are talking about Cher.  The DVD packinging is awesome, with a holographic background that accentuates her youth.<br />Eventhough this dubbed the &quot;Farewell Tour&quot;.  I really hope she is lying!!  &lt;snicker&gt;
B00005OM4N|1.0|For the love of God, please stop making records, Brit. You have no talent what so ever and your sending a message to girls that in order to recognized, all you need is to be good looking. To those who are buying her &quot;records&quot;, STOP IT!!! If it weren't for people like you, she would have disappeard a long time ago. Instead of wasting your money on crap like this, support real artists who can write their own music and are about music. Honestly, this must end.
B000053GTF|5.0|I don't know if there are any further ways to say &quot;Celine is legendary&quot;.  This DVD proves it.  Her vocal quality, range and interpretation are unmatched, plus she's gorgeous.<br />Everything on this DVD is awesome, but the one performance that stood out most was &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;.  I was so overwhelmed I was nearly shaking...so very powerful.  I would have given the DVD five stars alone on that performance.  I'm so glad I have it to admire forever now...
B00004Y6OA|5.0|With this album the true rock and jam of Van Halen was shown in my opinion.  This along with Fair Warning are the two albums the true VH fans pop in!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I just had the pleasure of seeing Gavin live last week, and I had bought his cd the week before but didn't listen to it much.  After seeing him live, I haven't stopped listening to his cd!  I have it on repeat and can't get enough of it.  My favorite song is &quot;Meaning&quot; and &quot;Chemical Party&quot; reminds me of his cute facial expressions when he was singing it on stage.  I recommend this cd, it's a keeper!
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This album kicks ass and there is nothing left to say...from front to finish it can be played over and over and over.
0684833395|5.0|A fabulous anti-war novel hidden in the midst of a laugh-out-loud comedy.  This is one of the funniest books ever written.  At the same time, though, it allows us to see the ridiculity of war and violence in general.  You're crazy if you don't read this book, but since you're crazy you might not mind, and....well you know the rest.
B000002L99|4.0|for the next phase...excellent lyrics and a movement in the music that was pretty cool.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Spectacular! Magnificent! Japanese Anime at its best if I ever saw it!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|with this album and that's the bottom line!
B000005HNQ|5.0|On their second release featuring vocalist Anneke van Giersbergen, the Dutch band The Gathering moves even further away from their death metal roots, though they continue to be inexplicably lumped into that genre.  It's unfortunate, because most of the bad reviews you'll read of The Gathering are a result of this confusion.  Either way, the band shows a growth in their sound, a continuation of the atmospheric, moody beauty first presented on their previous release &quot;Mandylion.&quot;  Annke's vocals, while certainly haunting and beautiful, may not be technically perfect, as pointed out by a few narrow-minded reviewers, but there has rarely been a case where a singer's voice was so perfectly suited to the music she's singing.  It really is magical at times (right around the 5 minute mark in &quot;On Most Surfaces,&quot; for example).  &quot;Nighttime Birds&quot; is a solid progression to the sound the band cultivated on &quot;Mandylion,&quot; being a little less metal, a little more atmospheric, carrying themselves futher from &quot;death&quot; and closer to &quot;prog.&quot;
B000002MUQ|4.0|on this album.  I think the frustration and fighting was starting to take its toll and it shows.  The album is good but doesn't really take an identity.
